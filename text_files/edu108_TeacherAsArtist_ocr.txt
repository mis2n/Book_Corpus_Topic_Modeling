PREFACE 
In the following pages the first essay raises the 
question whether the art of teaching may in a 
» measure become one of the fine arts, and answers 
in the affirmative, under certain conditions. 
What these conditions are the second essay at- 
tempts to set forth. Though the esthetic experi- 
ence is complex and difficult to analyze, I have 
endeavored to be as intelligible as the subject 
itself allows, having in mind busy teachers who 
have neither the time nor the inclination to 
puzzle over unnecessary difficulties. 
That the standard here set up for the teaching 
process is high, perhaps too high for general at- 
tainment yet awhile, is admitted; yet we may 
steer by the stars. My idealistic writings on edu- 
cation have been criticized for lifting the stand- 
ards too high, “putting the teacher on a pedes- 
tal,” and seeing philosophical significance in 
“mere pedagogy.” The charge is well founded

EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
THERE are many teachers who are good artisans; 
there are only a few who are fine artists. All 
teachers who are successful enough to hold their 
appointments possess the useful power to trans- 
form human nature so that it is better informed, 
more moral, and more effectively active than 
before. But the process by which these valuable 
results are brought about may have been more or 
less mechanical and quite unpleasing to the 
pupil. The pupil himself, well informed, thought- 
ful, and dynamic, may not be a wholesome and 
attractive personality. The process and the 
product of the finely artistic teacher are vastly 
different. He teaches, he is inspiring and genial, 
and those who study and labor under his guid- 
ance do so with spontaneity and affection. The 
men and women he rears are more than strong 
and forceful, learned and skillful; they are har- 
moniously developed personalities, wholesome 
and charming, for whom “‘the world steps aside”

more than half the time. The fine artist in the 
classroom differs from the mere artisan in more 
things than degree of ability. There is a differ- 
ence both of aim and of method. 
There was an older type of education that 
made of every man it touched the scholar and 
gentleman. Too often our newer type of school 
training makes only the scholar and omits the 
gentleman. It is the blend of the two at which 
the truly artistic teacher aims. However narrow 
the field of study may seem to be, this master 
pursues his specialty with a reverent regard for 
relationships and settings. He gives a liberal 
education in a single course. His treatment is 
specialized but never narrowing. Into the class- 
room he brings a character as well as a mind. 
He conveys both values and truths. In him 
there is no forgetfulness of the man, the gentle- 
man, in whom the trained mind is to reside. 
While his direct and obvious business is to make 
a thinker, he never forgets the more important 
obligation of training character. His objective 
is nothing less than the making of a wholesome, 
attractive, and admirable personality, which

reveals no inconsistency, no lack of balance, no 
want of charm. His artistic and pedagogic aim 
is to produce a beautiful character. 
As the ends toward which we mould human 
nature differ, so the processes of achievement 
vary. The fine artist at teaching has a technique 
different from that of any ordinary teacher. To 
begin with he has a keen regard for the individu- 
ality of his products. He handles each boy and 
girl with a particular care which takes into 
account personal traits. For this reason he is 
versatile in the ways and means of his craft. His 
teaching life seldom seems to repeat itself. 
Every moment, every topic, every human mood 
is a new challenge to his resourcefulness. His is 
a life of adventure, in which there is nothing of 
the dull repetition, the monotony, and the 
routine of which so many instructors complain. 
Each youth is still true to himself when such a 
teacher is done with his instruction. The educa- 
tional machine, with its uniform disregard for va- 
riations in materials and its passion for making 
all human units copies of one another, cannot 
exist in a company of artistic teachers.

EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
The teacher of whom we speak is a sym- 
pathetic interpreter. An idealist he is, trying to 
realize his ideals in human substance; but he has 
a fine regard for what is human. The acade- 
mician and the pedant are unlovely products 
in his eyes. He tolerates human imperfection 
rather than wrench youth too far from its in- 
stinctive bases. His is the art, not of making a 
new kind of man, but of improving the one he 
finds. He accentuates whatever virtues he finds, 
and softens the weaknesses, leaving in our pres- 
ence an old and familiar friend whom we find 
more admirable and companionable than be- 
fore. There is something finely tolerant about 
such a worker in human stuff. He is as far as can 
be from that fanaticism which would overpower 
every pupil’s soul and make it like the ‘school- 
master’s. 
The artist’s ways are interesting. He keeps his 
students open-eyed. He is as sure of purpose as 
any old-fashioned martinet, but he does not 
drive. He stimulates, he suggests, he exemplifies. 
His methods are patient and roundabout, but 
the speed he puts in his pupils more than com- 
x

EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
pensates for the length of the route taken. His 
workshop in mid-process does not seem as tidy 
as one might expect; but his job is the neatest in 
the end. The children are forever making mis- 
takes as they try themselves out. The artist- 
teacher is unabashed regardless of the number of 
_ visitors who see the incompleteness of each step. 
He will get the perfect result he wants in the 
end —a man or a woman poised, thoughtful, 
kindly, and sure. He will have given his own love 
of high values, clear thinking, and forceful action 
to his wards. Against any imperfection he has 
left with them, he has given them the power to 
grow forever. His creativeness has been dynamic. 
The teacher who sets out upon the duty of 
teaching young men and women the fine art of 
artist at transmitting life. Personality is the 
instrument for conveying his message. Let every 
aspiring teacher who is not afraid of a difficult 
and a subtle task be a student of fine artistry. 
Its general laws will offer more than one rich 
suggestion.

THE TEACHER AS ARTIST 
I 
IS TEACHING A FINE ART? 
Teaching as a physical process 
Tat teaching is a physical process, when re- 
garded from a certain point of view, is admitted. 
Teachers make use of their own bodies, of the 
bodies of their pupils, of sound waves, of ether 
vibrations, of schoolrooms, books, and appara- 
tus. Indeed, the physical aspects of good teach- 
ing have come into great prominence recently in 
the way of school hygiene, medical inspection, 
dietetics, and care for heating, lighting, ventila- 
tion, as well as exterior and interior decoration. 
Teaching as an intellectual process 
That teaching is an intellectual process also, 
none will care to deny. Indeed, from the modern 
historical standpoint, teaching since the Renais- 
sance in Europe has been mainly an intellectual 
I 
 
-P-A-G-E-14
  THE TEACHER AS ARTIST 
process, with emphasis placed on the getting of 
knowledge, first of the humanities, then of the 
sciences, and finally of society. From this stand- 
point “to teach” is synonymous with to instruct, 
to inform, to communicate or awaken ideas. To 
regard the end of teaching as either knowledge, 
or the ability to think, or both, is to emphasize 
the intellectual element involved in it. 
Teaching as a personal process 
That teaching is also a moral, a personal, a 
spiritual process, we must also admit, for the 
teacher is an influential person and the pupils are 
susceptible persons, and in teaching there is an 
interchange of personality between teacher and 
taught, as well as the exchange of ideas. The 
elusive and intangible and not the least impor- 
tant results of teaching belong to it as a personal 
process. Where professionalism enters teaching, 
this personal aspect enters least. 
Is teaching also an esthetic process? 
But is teaching also an esthetic process? Or, 
is it capable of becoming such? That is our pres- 
2
-P-A-G-E-15
IS TEACHING A FINE ART? 
ent question. It may be admitted at the outset 
that often, perhaps usually, teaching is neither a 
thing of beauty nor a joy forever. 
We are not now concerned to ask whether 
teaching essentially is a physical, or intellectual, 
or personal, or esthetic process, — perhaps it is 
essentially a personal process, — but only to ask 
whether teaching is, at least potentially, an 
zsthetic process. 
De Quincey’s Essay on Murder 
The most humorous and the most ironical of 
the writings of Thomas De Quincey is his Essay 
on Murder considered as one of the Fine Arts. De 
Quincey’s serio-comic genius could no doubt have 
succeeded equally well with our topic. If murder 
may be regarded as a fine art, we may imagine 
him asking, why not teaching even more so? For 
the murderer can at most destroy only the body, 
but the teacher can maim, aye destroy, even the 
soul. But, lacking the genius of De Quincey, we 
must omit the comic element in the treatment 
and consider only seriously the possibility of 
teaching being or even becoming a fine art. In 
3 
 
-P-A-G-E-16
  ‘THE TEACHER AS ARTIST 
his fascinating discussion De Quincey proceeded 
by examples, considering different instances of 
murder from the esthetic standpoint; but our 
serious mode of treatment will require us to pro- 
ceed by principles. The discussion will lead us 
into several matters concerning art, in relation to 
each of which we can test teaching as a candidate 
for membership in the circle of the arts. 
The nature of art 
To begin with, what is art? Professor Tufts ? 
defines art as “any activity or production involv- 
ing intelligence and skill.” This definition per- 
mits us to contrast art with three other things, 
namely, unskillful production, science, and a 
work of nature. 
Unskilled labor and art 
An unskillful activity, such as carrying a hod 
of brick, stands in contrast with such a skillful 
activity as bricklaying; and bricklaying again 
stands in contrast with such a highly skillful 
1 J. H. Tufts, article “Art and Art Theories” in Baldwin’s 
Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology. 
4 
 
-P-A-G-E-17
IS TEACHING A FINE ART? 
activity as designing a brick house. Even the 
hod-carrier may develop a certain skill in han- 
dling his burden in the easiest way. A group of 
laborers hammering steel drills in a quarry show 
additional skill when they beat out a rhythm. 
Science and art 
In contrast with science, which is knowledge, 
an art is action. In science, the intellect is pri- 
marily involved; in art, the will. In science, truth 
is our goal; in art, performance of some kind. It 
is true that this contrast is not absolute, for 
there is no science without the will to know and 
there is no art without the intellect, as the defini- 
tion itself indicates. 
Nature and art 
The third contrast is between art and a work of 
nature. Art begins with some modification or 
even copy of nature. That plants should grow is 
a work of nature, that they should be made to 
grow in systematic groupings according to the 
color of their flowers is a work of man, is an art. 
The products of nature, the stone, the crystal,
-P-A-G-E-18
THE TEACHER AS ARTIST 
the snow-flake, the mountains, the ocean, the 
clouds driven by the wind, science supposes, per- 
haps incorrectly, to involve neither intelligence 
nor skill in their making; the products of man, 
the stone hammer, the mirror, the house, the 
boat, the sail, the engine, the telegraph, the air- 
ship, require both intelligence and skill. The arts 
of civilization thus stand in contrast with the 
works of nature. When teachers of arts — e.g., of 
expression — urge that their pupils “be natural,” 
“follow nature,” etc., the injunction is ambigu- 
ous; to do so literally would cancel all art; what is 
really meant is to be so artful as to conceal the 
appearance of art. ‘‘To be natural” in any art is 
not to be as nature is, but to be as nature ought 
to be to satisfy man’s purpose. 
Colvin’s definition of art 
Another definition of art at this point may help 
us. Professor Colvin + defines art as “every reg- 
ulated operation or dexterity by which organized 
beings pursue ends which they know beforehand, 
1 Sidney Colvin, article “Art” in Encyclopedia Britannica, 
oth ed. 
6
-P-A-G-E-19
IS TEACHING A FINE ART? 
together with the rules and the result of every 
such activity.” That the operation should be 
“regulated” involves skill, the pursuit of ends 
involves intelligence, and the presence of rules 
shows the dexterity to be formally guided. 
Ts teaching an art? 
Now, in the light of these definitions, is teach- 
ing an art? Is it an activity? It is. Does it in- 
volve intelligence? It does. Does it involve skill? 
It does. Is it a science? It is not, though there 
may be a science of teaching. Is it a work of 
nature? It is not, but, on the contrary, is a work 
of man modifying nature. Has it rules of pro- 
cedure? It has, though the poorest practice in 
teaching may be leagues behind the best rules. 
On the whole, then, we must conclude that 
teaching is an art, though the intelligence and 
skill it involves may in some cases rank it with 
hod-carrying, in others with bricklaying, and 
perhaps in a few others with the plans of the 
architect.
-P-A-G-E-20
    THE TEACHER AS ARTIST 
Tufts’ definition of fine art 
_ But there is a difference between art and fine 
art and our main question was, Is teaching a fine 
art? But what isa fine art? Recurring to Profes- 
sor Tufts’ article we read that a fine art is “an 
activity or product of activity which has esthetic 
value or (in the broadest sense of the term) is 
beautiful.” This second definition directs our 
attention to esthetic value as the distinguishing 
mark between art and fine art. But what is the 
nature of esthetic value? We will first take the 
standpoint of an observer of a work of fine art 
in a studio, or, in the analogous case, of a super- 
visor of teaching in the classroom. 
The characteristics of esthetic value 
There are five main characteristics of esthetic 
value possessed by a work of art. First, esthetic 
value is objective; that is, it is there for all, share- 
able, universal; it is not purely private and per- 
sonal and agreeable to the senses. The fruit that 
appears painted in “studies of still life” is out 
there for all to see, to enjoy, and to realize the 
8  
-P-A-G-E-21
IS TEACHING A FINE ART? 
meaning of fruit through space and light effects, 
whereas the fruit one ate for breakfast gives only 
an individual pleasure. The pride one takes in 
owning zsthetic objects is not an esthetic feeling, 
it is the property or ownership feeling; it is not 
necessary to own a work of art in order to enjoy 
it. 
Second, the esthetic value is intrinsic ; that is, 
it is disinterested, immediate, contemplative, not 
utilitarian, mediate, practical, or even moral. 
The frame of the picture and its two dimensions 
separate it as a work of art from the practical 
world in which we live. An automobile taking its 
place in a painting of a city street scene may be 
part of a work of fine art, but if it appears in a 
catalogue, it loses its esthetic value in proportion 
as it serves the purpose of sale. The viewing of 
the Apollo Belvedere as the Greek ideal of man- 
hood is esthetic, allowing it to possess intrinsic 
value, but the use of the same to study the physi- 
ology of the bodies of the Greeks is not esthetic 
but utilitarian. We do not ask beauty to justify 
its existence by doing any of the world’s work for 
us, but only to represent some ideal to us that we 
9
-P-A-G-E-22
  THE TEACHER AS ARTIST 
may repose in it. As Professor Miinsterberg + 
shows, the essence of art is isolation from the 
practical world of cause and effect, just as the 
essence of science is connection with antecedents 
and consequents. 
Third, the work of art whose esthetic value we 
feel widens sympathy. In enjoying the work of art 
our feelings appropriate the feeling the artist put 
into the piece, or something akin to it, our sym- 
pathies are enlarged to include the life and mean- 
ing of the piece of art. A good painting of a shep- 
herd with his sheep and the faithful dog reveals 
to us a significance and meaning which the sight 
of the real objects often fails to convey. The rea- 
son for this is that the artist feels more than we 
do in the presence of the experiences of life, and, 
by selecting and eliminating features, he spreads 
on canvas, in light and shade, in form, and color, 
accentuated suggestions of feeling, meaning, and 
significance. Thereafter we return into life’s ex- 
periences with heightened susceptibilities. This 
is the answer to those practical-minded people 
1H. Miinsterberg, The Principles of Art Education, part 1. 
New York, 1905. 
10
-P-A-G-E-23
IS TEACHING A FINE ART? 
who say, with one of the characters in Bryce’s 
Story of a Ploughboy : — 
What’s a picture, after all? Merely a shadow of 
the real. Why do people like paintings, or profess to 
like them? Because they ’ve lost the use of their eyes; 
they can’t see Nature. Can any paintings of the sea 
match the sea itself? What man in his senses would 
shut himself up in a room to look at paintings of the 
sky if he could live in country air and look up at the 
sky when he liked? All this luxury you’ve been talk- 
ing about is n’t a means of helping us to enjoy life; 
it’s an encumbrance; it’s an obstruction; it keeps us 
from the sun, it keeps us in a stuffy room when we 
might be out of doors. And all this talk about Art 
has done as much as anything to hinder real reform. 
I told Ruskin that when he was blathering in Fors. 
And he came to see it, for he said more than once that 
he felt he would never do any good till he stopped 
talking and began to work like a man. But, poor 
soul! he had n’t the courage any more than the rest 
of us. 
Fourth, in the best art there is a sense of con- 
scious self-illusion, as some one has described it. 
In viewing a fine portrait of some friend, we seem 
to be in his presence again, to feel his spirit, to 
share his atmosphere, to realize his ideals, — in. 
II
-P-A-G-E-24
  THE TEACHER AS ARTIST 
this consists the self-illusion; but we do not break 
the sacred silence to ask him questions, even 
though we consider it ‘‘a speaking likeness,’’ — 
in this the self-illusion is conscious. That Zeuxis 
deceived ‘the birds with his painting of lifelike 
grapes and that Parrhasius deceived even Zeuxis 
with his realistic painting of the curtain, is not 
the highest evidence of the skill of those painters; 
in those cases the self-illusion was not conscious. 
The portrait is selective and heightening in effect, 
it could not be mistaken for the original; a col- 
ored, life-size photograph is unselective and 
“just-so” in its presentation; it might be mis- 
taken for the original, but its esthetic value is 
lower than that of the portrait. The Eden 
Musée, where death is mistaken for life, does not 
stir as high esthetic emotions as the Metropoli- 
tan Museum where life is consciously viewed in 
idealized form. We admire the talent shown in 
the one, the genius in the other. 
Fifth, there is often, not always, an element of 
pain or melancholy in the enjoyment of esthetic 
value. It is obvious in the threnody of poetry 
and in the minor strains of music. Milton ex- 
12
-P-A-G-E-25
IS TEACHING A FINE ART? 
presses it in J} Penseroso. The source of the feel- 
ing is not easy to find. The sense of the perfect 
disturbs us while it enraptures us. Even the pain 
it causes us is a delight which we should not care 
to forego, just as Peter, at the moment of realiz- 
ing his Master’s character, urges him to depart, 
though his Master’s departure would have 
pleased him still less. Perhaps the source of the 
feeling is the contrast effect between the ideal of 
art and the real of our own experience. As the 
ideal begins to harmonize our own ruffled and 
unordered feelings, the growing-pains of the soul 
arise. Even the soft blues of an Italian sky may 
dim the eyes and awaken an inexpressible sad- 
ness. 
Teaching as having esthetic value 
Now, all this seems remote enough from what 
our school supervisor or visitor, looking for some 
show of art, can see and hear in the classroom. 
But the real question is not so much one of actual 
practice as one of possible practice. May not the 
observed teaching process come to have esthetic 
value? Objective it certainly is. A thing worth 
13 
 
-P-A-G-E-26
‘THE TEACHER AS ARTIST 
while in itself, having an intrinsic value for itself, 
it certainly may be, especially where the ideals of 
a liberal in distinction from a vocational training 
dominate, where things worth doing are done well 
for their own sake without regard to their prac- 
tical usefulness. A widening of sympathy will 
also result in case the ground covered is not too 
familiar and the treatment of the truth and life 
involved in the lesson is vital, real, and apprecia- 
tive. Even a sense of conscious self-illusion may 
be present when the teaching hour simulates the 
real original experience; there is no danger of its 
being mistaken for it; as when a teacher of Greek 
history plays for a time the part of Socrates and 
the pupils answer him as they suppose Athenian 
youths to have done. Any dramatization or even 
vivid word portrayal of past truth and life may 
awaken within us a sense of the original reality; 
thus the past lives again. In the ideal classroom 
living is real, the teaching that reproduces the 
racial experience is real, yet both teachers and 
pupils recognize that the life of which they speak 
is more real than the speaking of it. Regarding 
the last point, the sadness provoked by the ideal, 
14
-P-A-G-E-27
IS TEACHING A FINE ART? 
it is to be confessed that, so far, in the develop-. 
ment of teaching, this sense is aroused more by 
the absence than by the presence of the ideal. 
Even here, however, the observer may feel the 
sharp contrast between life as the school ideally 
represents it and life as it is, and he may find 
himself anticipating with regret the rude awak- 
enings awaiting unsophisticated young people. 
This is as it should be; the school should present 
life at its best, only hinting at the real existence of 
the mean and the sordid, and exalting the ideals 
of service and sacrifice. To the contemplative 
observer the work of some schoolrooms may in- 
deed appeal as having esthetic value because of 
the struggling efforts present to realize even in a 
crude way the highest ideals of living. 
The characteristics of esthetic activity 
A fine art, our definition said, was “‘an activity 
or a product of activity which has esthetic 
value.” We have considered the characteristics 
of esthetic value and how the teaching process 
may come to possess them. Now we must in- 
quire concerning the nature of the activity itself 
15
-P-A-G-E-28
  THE TEACHER AS ARTIST 
by which works of beauty are produced, with a 
view to considering whether the teacher also may 
become an artist in his work. From the stand- 
point of an observer of a work of art we pass to 
that of the producer. 
Lack of data 
We are handicapped at the outset of this 
inquiry by the lack of suitable material upon 
which to base conclusions. Artists do creative 
work, but they do not tell us how they do it. 
Their minds are bent on production, not intro- 
spection. We could wish more artists would tell 
us how it feels to write a poem, to compose a 
piece of music, to carve a statue, to paint a pic- 
ture, to design a building, or to beautify a natural 
landscape. The introspection upon which such 
reports would rest would itself cripple the activ- 
ity it was observing. Those readers who are 
themselves artists may, however, by memory 
verify and correct our account of their work. 
Wolf-Ferrari, the musical composer, is quoted 
as saying in regard to his method of composi- 
tion: — 
16
-P-A-G-E-29
IS TEACHING A FINE ART? 
I could not bear to plan or to feel that I had a 
method. I should not like to know where I shall eat 
luncheon to-morrow. No more do I want to know 
how or in what manner I shall write my next work. 
I want it to be natural. I want the music to express 
the text, — that is all I care about. 
Here certainly is artistic spontaneity. 
Channing Pollock, in The Footlights — Fore 
and Aft, gives the following description of one 
dramatist at work: — 
When Eugene Walter writes a play the tools neces- 
sary to the process are one large room, one outfit of 
furniture and one exceptionally rapid stenographer. 
Mr. Walter and the stenographer enter the room. 
The door is locked, and work is begun by placing the 
furniture as it is to be placed on the stage — in other 
words, by setting the scene. Then the young drama- 
tist begins to act. He is all the characters in his play. 
He rushes about the apartment, quarreling with 
himself, making love to himself, now standing here 
as one person and then racing to the opposite end of 
the apartment to be another. All the time he is 
speaking the words that come into his mind as na- 
tural under the circumstances, and the stenographer 
is taking them down at top speed. At the end of an 
hour or two an act is finished, an invisible curtain is 
17
-P-A-G-E-30
THE TEACHER AS ARTIST 
rung down, and if the amanuensis has n’t fainted, 
as two did in one day of labor on one play, the stage 
is set for the next act. 
Here at least are self-expression, imagination, 
and imitation. 
Six characteristics of esthetic activity 
On the whole there appear to be six main 
characteristics of the esthetic activity. These 
are spontaneity, self-expression, imagination, 
imitation, love, and self-relief. These six are very 
closely related as the discussion of them will 
indicate. 
Spontaneity. The esthetic activity is spon- 
taneous; that is, it is self-initiated, free, inspired, 
natural, playful. The activity that is not self- 
activity cannot be esthetic; it can be mechani- 
cal. The great poems are not made to order, they 
are not even poems for occasions. Hack work 
may be done for pay at command but artistic 
activity must be stimulated from within. Beauty 
rather creates a demand for itself than supplies it. 
The artists who receive orders to be filled must at 
least be given time for their inspiration to come.

Self-expression. The esthetic activity is self- 
expressive; that is, it exhibits the self of the 
artist. The artist must have a self to exhibit, and 
the kind of self he is will appear in his art, if his 
art is sincere. Some artists reveal more of them- 
selves than others; thus did Goethe more than 
Shakespeare, though it is probably true that, if 
we knew the life of Shakespeare better, we should 
see him more in his works than we are now able 
to do. And one material is more expressive of 
personality than another; thus music is more ex- 
pressive than architecture. The content of the 
work of art is largely supplied by the ideas and 
experiences of the artist. Good art is a pleasing 
exhibition of the self of the artist. 
Imagination. The esthetic activity involves 
imagination, — imagination, that is, of the pro- 
ductive, not of the reproductive, type. The pro- 
ductive imagination of the artist re-combines old 
experiences in new ways. The poet gives us a 
new arrangement of old words descriptive of his 
feelings and ideas. The musical composer gives us 
the familiar sounds in unfamiliar combinations, 
expressing the harmony or chaos his soul feels.

“THE TEACHER AS ARTIST 
The sculptor gives us the familiar human or ani- 
mal body in a new position or exhibiting a differ- 
ent emotion. The painter combines old colors in 
new ways suggesting new shades of feeling. The 
architect uses old motives in new ways to suit the 
central idea of the building. The imagination of 
the artist is creative, not in the sense that it 
makes something out of nothing, but in the sense 
that it shapes old material in novel ways. 
Imitation. The esthetic activity is imitative; 
this was its essential characteristic to Plato, and , 
on this ground he condemned art as unreal, his 
standard of reality, however, being intellectual, 
not emotional. The presence of imitation in art 
is most obvious in the paintings, carvings, and 
drawings from models or nature. The initial 
training of the artist is largely copying. But 
merely imitative art is never first grade. By imi- 
tating the work of another, one ends by finding 
himself. The finest products of art are indeed 
imitative but in a very free and original manner. 
The photograph in colors of a scene is the exact 
imitation of the landscape, but the photograph is 
not such high art as a painting of that scene. In 
20  
-P-A-G-E-33
IS TEACHING A FINE ART? 
the painting there is still imitation, but in addi- 
tion there is selection and emphasis of certain 
features in the landscape; the final painting is the 
scene not as it is in itself but as it appears to the 
artist. Thus fine art is not really holding “the 
mirror up to nature,” it is idealizing nature. 
Thus the imitation that characterizes the #s- 
thetic activity is not exact in detail, but faithful 
to the type. 
Love. All art is animated by the love-impulse. 
The artist is a lover; he is in love with the ideal, 
in love with his work, and in love with the partic- 
ular piece upon which he is working. The love- 
impulse behind art is closely related to the social 
instinct. Though artistic genius begins to dis- 
close itself in early years ordinarily, the highest 
appreciation and production of art cannot arise 
before adolescence. The artist is habituated to 
expressing his love in his work; he is not accus- 
tomed to restraining but to expressing his love- 
impulse. It is possible that this fact helps to ex- 
plain, though not to justify, the frequent moral 
irregularity of artists. However this may be, it is 
important to recognize that all art is begotten in 
21
-P-A-G-E-34
  THE TEACHER AS ARTIST 
love. There is a certain intensity, heat, glow, and 
sense of fullness in all esthetic activity. 
Self-relief. It is not surprising that esthetic 
activity should end in self-relief. The burden is 
discharged and relaxation supervenes. The sur- 
plus energy has been worked off and lassitude 
results. The emotional pressure is over, the 
muscles lose their tenseness, the whole being lets 
down. There is a certain joy in being delivered of 
a part of one’s self which may survive one’s self 
and even the shocks of time. The period of relax- 
ation is likely to be of short duration, however; 
some other conception begins to grow in the soul 
toward maturity; then the nervous strain of self- 
delivery comes on again, followed by relief; and 
so the process repeats itself. In its mothering of 
ideals all art is feminine. 
Teaching as an esthetic activity 
Teaching appears as a possible fine art even 
better in its relation to the esthetic activity than 
to the esthetic values previously considered. 
The teacher is like the artist, the pupils are his 
material through whom he is expressing his 
22 
 
-P-A-G-E-35
  IS TEACHING A FINE ART? 
ideals. Such an artist teacher is spontaneous and 
free in his methods, knowing the rules of the 
technique of teaching but subordinating them to 
his own purposes. He is self-expressive in letting 
his pupils fully into the secrets of his ambition for 
them as individuals and in showing the ideals 
regnant in his own life. He is imaginative in 
handling the familiar material of instruction in 
new and unfamiliar ways, making contrasts and 
suggesting comparisons. He is imitative of the 
great masters of teaching, Socrates, Jesus, Pes- 
tolozzi, and Froebel, but in his own independent 
way. He is animated by the love of teaching, by 
the love of his pupils, and by the joy he finds in 
making ideals take root in human lives. And at 
the end of each day’s work, each week’s, each 
year’s, there is the sense of having emptied him- 
self, the demand for quiet and rest till the burden 
of fullness is again present. In this cycle of self- 
expression and assimilation, of giving forth and 
taking in, of transferring personality and re-gain- 
ing personality, the teacher finds that he too may 
be an artist in his work, embodying day by day 
his highest ideals of living in the plastic growing 
23
-P-A-G-E-36
  THE TEACHER AS ARTIST 
material of the nation’s youth. Seeing visions 
constantly himself, he lives to assist others in 
seeing them, and rejoices daily in his exalted 
calling. Not all teachers are, or can hope to be- 
come, artists in their work, because their eyes are 
blind, their ears deaf, their hearts heavy of under- 
standing, their tasks formal, their pupils obnox- 
ious, their work drudgery, and even their ideals 
ignoble. The difference is rather in the teacher 
than ‘in the pupil or the equipment. The artist is 
an artist in any environment, and so is the unfor- 
tunate blockhead. But many teachers have the 
making of artists in them and do not know it; 
for these particularly we must work. The artist 
teacher works not with brush and canvas, nor 
with chisel and marble, but with truths and 
youths, with ideals and nervous systems. He too 
like the artists of the world is striving to embody 
the ideal in the real. 
How teaching differs from the other fine arts 
There is one important distinction between the 
esthetic activity of the teacher and of other ar- 
tists which we must bear in mind if we would not 
24
-P-A-G-E-37
IS TEACHING A FINE ART? 
press the analogy between teaching and the fine 
arts too far. This distinction regards the material 
which is informed by the ideals. The material of 
other artists, whether wood, stone, marble, brass, 
colors, sounds, is inert and impersonal, while that 
of the teacher is alive and personal. Other artists 
may have regard for their ideals alone, shaping 
their material at pleasure to embody them; the 
teacher must have regard also for his material, 
which he cannot shape at pleasure because it has 
a form and essence of its own. Other artists con- 
form their material to their ideals; the teacher 
must transform his ideals to suit his material. 
Other artists make bodies for their ideals; the 
teacher must enable bodies to grow into the ideals 
of their own nature. The teacher is not so much 
like the sculptor as he is like the gardener. It is 
hard to say whether this distinction renders the 
work of teaching more or less difficult, more or 
less “fine,” than the other arts. 
The nature of the esthetic product 
Recurring once again to our definition of fine 
art, namely, “an activity, or a product of activ- 
25
-P-A-G-E-38
  THE TEACHER AS ARTIST 
ity, which has esthetic value,” we note there is 
one element of it hitherto unconsidered, — the 
esthetic product. We have considered the nature 
of esthetic value and the nature of zsthetic activ- 
ity, and we have now to ask, what is the work of 
art itself? 
The idealistic philosophy of art 
Without reviewing the interesting and devel- 
oping series of historic answers to this question, 
which would take us too far afield, let us select 
and contrast two typical views of the nature of 
art, namely, the idealistic and the pragmatic. Ac- 
cording to the idealistic view, the work of art is 
the imitation of some ideal, and utility does not 
essentially belong to it. This philosophy of art 
would be represented by the names of Plato, Aris- 
totle, and Hegel, and is expressed in part by the 
familiar line of Keats, “‘a thing of beauty is a joy 
forever,’ coupled with the thought of Emerson, 
“beauty is its own excuse for being.” 
Plato as an example. To take Plato for more 
specific consideration as an example of the ideal- 
istic philosophy of art. Plato is the first theo- 
26
-P-A-G-E-39
  IS TEACHING A FINE ART? 
rist to consider art critically. Paraphrasing his 
thought, we may express it briefly, though some- 
what cumbrously, as follows: art is the imita- 
tion of an imitation of some divine idea. Let us 
explain. According to Plato the real world is 
the ideal world, the world of existent, objective, 
universal ideas. He reached this view through 
taking the ‘‘concepts” of Socrates as the real 
elements in knowledge and raising them to an 
absolute existence. Thus there are “ideas” of 
wisdom, courage, temperance, justice, and even 
of classes of material objects, like men and beds, 
and, highest of all, there is the idea of the good. 
In his dialogue Timeus, Plato represents God 
as an artist making the world in accord with the 
“ideas” as eternal patterns. Now the artisan, like 
bed- and bridle-maker, makes objects according 
to their idea, that is, according to the purpose 
they are set to serve. Then comes the artist — 
the painter or poet, who imitates the object, 
which itself is the artisan’s imitation of the-real 
idea. Thus art is an imitation of an imitation of 
an idea. Thus the artist is really dealing with 
reality at third hand; he presents us only with the 
27 
 
-P-A-G-E-40
  THE TEACHER AS ARTIST 
appearance of an appearance, with the shadow of 
a shadow. 
For these reasons, Plato, though once a poet 
himself, and always a literary artist, did not es- 
teem art highly. The ideal state had little room 
for artists and the ideal curriculum little place for 
art, for it did not bring the mind into close touch 
with reality as did mathematics and philosophy. 
‘Art is indeed useless in conducting us to reality, 
according to Plato, but in this he found reason 
not for praising but for condemning art, except 
such simple forms of song and music as made 
soldiers brave and such simple beauty in the 
environment as refined the taste. 
Modern idealistic philosophy of art in contrast 
with Plato’s 
The modern idealistic philosophy of art still 
regards it, with Plato, as a striving to express an 
inexpressible ideal and still finds utility absent 
from its essential nature, but, unlike Plato, 
praises instead of condemns art for its useless- 
ness. That about art which to Plato was a defect 
has become one of its admirable qualities. Both 
28  
-P-A-G-E-41
IS TEACHING A FINE ART? 
Plato and the modern idealists want the ideal but 
they differ in that Plato regarded art as detaching 
us from the ideal whereas moderns regard art as 
attaching us to the ideal. This difference is due 
fundamentally to Aristotle who made the ideal 
immanent in life instead of transcendent. 
Summary 
In sum, the idealistic philosophy of art makes 
it an imitation of an ideal copy and free from 
utility, whether blamed or praised for this latter 
characteristic. 
The pragmatic philosophy of art 
Now in contrast, the pragmatic philosophy of 
art. According to pragmatism, art is not so much 
a copy of what is as a promise of what is to be, it 
is not static but dynamic, it is not retrospective 
but prospective, it is not imitation of an existent 
ideal but a formulation of a distant ideal becom- 
ing real in time. And the effect of art upon us is 
not to quiet but to inspire, not to rest us but to 
stimulate us. Consequently, utility is part of the 
essence of art. The pragmatists would disagree 
29 
 
-P-A-G-E-42
  THE TEACHER AS ARTIST 
with Plato that art is the imitation of an absolute 
ideal but they would agree with him in condemn- 
ing useless art, the art that does not conduct to 
truth and that does not form character. 
Miss Gordon quoted 
Let us illustrate the pragmatic philosophy of 
art by quotation from a recent writer. Miss Kate 
Gordon ! says: — 
The pragmatic view of art, I should say, is this, 
that art is not essentially an imitation of life—a 
copy of something done and finished before art took 
it up; but that life is a copy and imitation of art. If 
art is “the image of life,” it is more a prophetic than 
an historic image. . . . After seeing a Turner one sees 
more form and color in the sky. 
Which is the true theory ? 
Thus we have the two contrasting views of the 
nature of a work of art. Before asking whether 
teaching is or may become a work of art, we must 
consider which is the true theory of what a work 
of art is, the idealistic or the pragmatic? In an- 
1 “Pragmatism in Asthetics,” in Essays Philosophical and 
Psychological in Honor of William James. New York, 1908. 
30
-P-A-G-E-43
  
IS TEACHING A FINE ART? 
swering this question, fortunately we do not have 
to choose between the rival theories, as sometimes 
‘ must be done, but we may combine the two, if 
the idealists and the pragmatists will allow us. 
Art is both an imitation of the highest ideal the 
artist can conceive and it does usefully influence 
thought and character. Without the ideal, art 
has no content; without a beneficial influence, its 
content is unworthy. 
“Art for art’s sake” 
The phrase, “‘art for art’s sake,” originated as 
a protest against making painting tell a story, 
against the requirement that art should be narra- 
tive, and so ethical in influence. The phrase 
meant to insist on form in distinction from con- 
tent, and on beauty in distinction from goodness. 
The meaning of the phrase looks consequently in 
the direction of the idealistic rather than the 
pragmatic philosophy of art. Yet we have as- 
signed a measure of truth to the pragmatic phil- 
osophy of art. How then are these two things to 
be reconciled? 
31
-P-A-G-E-44
  
  THE TEACHER AS ARTIST 
Art for life’s sake 
Under examination the work of art reveals two 
elements, form and content. To insist upon form 
alone is to insist upon an abstraction, for there is 
no form without content, just as there can exist 
no content without form. It is an impossible 
purism to insist in art upon form for form’s sake. 
Content all art must have and does have, though 
less defined in some art, as in impressionism, than 
in others. 
Now wherever there is content there also 
is some effect upon thought, and so possibly 
upon character, as well as the effect upon feeling 
and sensation, which form gives. We must con- 
clude, therefore, that art cannot exist for art’s 
sake only, that the effects of beauty are also a 
part of its excuse for being, and that art, like 
truth, is also for life’s sake. This does not mean 
that the artist should strive for effect, or that he 
should regard himself primarily as a moralist, but 
only that he should recognize that no art is 
without its influence on thought and conduct as 
well as upon feeling, and that the highest art 
32 
 
-P-A-G-E-45
  IS TEACHING A FINE ART? 
will not offend logical and ethical standards at 
the same time that it conforms to standards of 
taste. 
Walter Pater on Plato 
Plato would probably agree to this conclusion 
which synthesizes the pragmatic and idealistic 
philosophies of art; at least he would as Pater 
finely interprets him, who says,’ “And Plato’s 
esthetics, remember, as such are ever in close 
connection with Plato’s ethics. It is life itself, 
action and character, he proposes to color; to get 
something of that irrepressible conscience of art, 
that spirit of control, into the general course of 
life, above all into its energetic or impassioned 
acts.” 
Final view of the esthetic product 
In summary, combining the two philosophies 
of art, we should have to say art is life in its ideal- 
ity, felt and expressed, and life is, or should be, 
such art loved, cherished, and obeyed.

THE TEACHER AS ARTIST 
Teaching as a work of art 
If now we inquire whether teaching is or may 
become a work of art, the question means two 
things, namely, does teaching imitate and repre- 
sent ideals? and does it shape life in accord with 
those ideals? In both cases the answer is affirma- 
tive: some teaching does do these two things, and 
all teaching should. Teaching at its best does feel 
and express the ideals of life, — health, truth, 
beauty, goodness, social efficiency, and God; and 
it does win allegiance to these ideals in the daily 
living of young people. Thus teaching is both an 
ideality and a practicality. It is the business of 
the school to set, not simply to conform to, social 
standards; and by its corporate atmosphere to 
demonstrate that the higher life is practicable. 
Aisthetic teaching is life interpreted in terms of 
its best, as life again is, or should be, such teach- 
ing applied.   Miss Slattery quoted 
An example may be quoted at length from 
Miss Slattery, who writes: ?

-P-A-G-E-47
IS TEACHING A FINE ART? 
The business of every teacher is to encourage and 
enthuse every pupil he teaches. He is an artist, and 
the picture he paints should awaken the ambition of 
each child, stir his soul with desire to be, and inspire 
him with confidence that he canbe. Andif the teacher 
is keenly alive, a lover of the world, feels the response 
of its great heart, his task is perfectly possible. 
I can never forget a magazine story, “The Artist’s 
Masterpiece,” told me by a friend some years ago. 
It is a wonderful story and shows just what all I have 
been saying means. 
Back into the country town that gave him birth, 
the story says, came the great artist, proud of all the 
honor and success hard work had brought to him. 
He wanted rest, to see the old places he loved and 
live over again the simple natural life of his boyhood. 
At first the people were afraid of his fame, but ina 
few weeks he was the interested friend of men, women 
and children, trusted and loved by all save one — 
Ma, A——; 
Ten years before, Mr. A—— had come a stranger 
to the town. He said nothing about himself, had no 
letters of introduction, would answer no questions. 
He opened a law office where he spent his days; at 
night he studied. He was a mystery. Rumor said 
that an important position awaited him in a distant 
city, but he would not return. One day the town was 
greatly excited over a consulship in a distant land 
35
-P-A-G-E-48
  "THE TEACHER’ AS ARTIST 
which was offered him. He refused to accept it. After 
a time they grew accustomed to him, spoke of him in 
half suspicious tones, and left him to himself. 
» The artist had tried in vain to know him. But one 
day, in response to the confidence in him which he 
had expressed, Mr. A—— said that he had made a 
mistake in his life, lost his courage, and wished to 
forget. He would say no more. After that, seeing 
him walk slowly along, head down, listless and not 
caring, a great desire to help him find life again filled 
the artist’s soul. 
He had promised himself a full year of rest, but 
now sought out a studio and began to paint. Ea- 
gerly, steadily, with keenest enthusiasm he labored. 
Months passed and his picture was finished. That 
day he sought Mr. A—— in his office and asked him 
to come down and see the picture. “It is my master- 
piece,” he said, “I shall never do anything better, I 
have put all my art into it. No one has seen it yet. 
Will you look at it?” 
Mr. A—— seemed pleased. They walked together 
to the studio. The artist stepped behind the great 
canvas stretched across the room. He pulled aside 
the crimson curtain, and there before him Mr. A—— 
saw himself. Yet it was not he, for the man upon the 
canvas faced the world straight, shoulders thrown 
back, head erect, ambition, desire. hope, in attitude 
and expression. 
36 
 
-P-A-G-E-49
IS TEACHING A FINE ART? 
For a long time he gazed in silence. The artist 
waited breathlessly to see if his masterpiece were a 
success or failure. At last Mr. A—— spoke. “He 
thinks I’m that,” he said. “He sees that in me.” 
Then a pause. “Am I that? Can I be that?” Ina 
moment the artist stood beside him. Together they 
looked at the man on the canvas while the other 
asked again, “Can I be that?” “Yes,” said the 
artist, and it seemed the voice of the masterpiece. 
Then said Mr. A——, gazing straight at it, “I will 
go back, I will be that.’’ And he went from the studio, 
courage, hope, confidence in every step. 
Summary of the whole discussion 
Thus, in sum, we have seen that teaching has, 
or may have, esthetic value; that it is, or may 
become, an esthetic activity; and that it is, or 
may be, an esthetic product. Is teaching then, 
finally, one of the fine arts? —The answer must be 
affirmative, if we take such answer not as a de- 
scription but as a challenge. Teaching is a fine 
art, if we make it so. The matter rests upon all 
school authorities, but mainly upon the teachers. 
It is not essentially a question of more teachers of 
art, though we need such, but of more artistic 
teachers.

How shall teachers become artistic? is the 
practical question. We will consider the answer 
in the following chapter.
-P-A-G-E-51
II 
THE SHRIVING OF AN INARTISTIC TEACHER 
The point of view 
Tue confessor and the priest are in this case the 
same. The confessor represents in a way his 
class. He is a teacher. The process of shriving 
involves confession, penance, and absolution. 
The confession covers lapses from the esthetic 
ideal, the penance includes renewed effort to con- 
form to esthetic principles, and absolution means 
the willingness to go on living with one’s faulty, 
but progressive and forgiven self. Other mem- 
bers of the class for whom the confessor speaks 
are craved to grant indulgence in proportion as 
they themselves are innocent. 
The lapse of the ideal 
I am not an artistic teacher and I belong to a 
class of inartistic teachers. Only on rare and 
brief occasions can I truthfully say, “I too am 
an artist.” I do not teach sufficiently by my 
39
-P-A-G-E-52
  THE TEACHER AS ARTIST 
ideals, I do not sufficiently idealize my work, and 
am not sufficiently inspired by the vision of ulti- 
mate results. I live and labor on the low plane 
of the valleys, forgetting the prospect from the 
hilltop, and often find myself too tired from the 
day’s work to climb. Yet I really live by such 
glimpses of the ideal as I have had or can catch. 
Our small influence 
As teacher I belong to one of the social classes. 
There are half a million of me in the United 
States alone. There are twenty thousand of me 
in New York City. The dignity, antiquity, and 
extent of our service constitute us one of the most 
important social classes. Not that any so-called 
social class, enjoying freedom of human inter- 
course, is more than an abstraction. We, like 
members of any other social class, have other re- 
lations than to our labor. Now it is a remarkable 
thing about us as a class that, belonging as we do 
to such a noble profession, we yet exert so little 
influence on the affairs of society, perhaps I had 
better say on the immediate affairs of society 
and on its adult membership. Our influence has

to wait a generation for children to grow up; 
meanwhile the conditions have changed; other 
types of leaders than teachers are doing things; 
and the teacher’s influence is hard to trace. No 
doubt it is there in some form. 
The reason 
5 Why are we not more influential socially? 
Mainly because we have the defects of our quali- 
ties. Our work is surrounded by certain condi- 
tions and engenders certain habits that mainly 
preclude social influence and leadership in social 
reform.! We do not see ourselves as others see us; 
if we did we might realize that our art does not 
count for more in society because we are often 
poor artists. The schoolmaster, the schoolmis- 
tress, have become literary types, easily subject 
to caricature, usually pictured as without par- 
ticular social esteem, wearing unique garments, 
and having characteristic features and expres- 
sion. Some people say they can tell a school- 
teacher on sight and, if they have the option,

they go the other way. “What shall we do with 
our college professors?” is a newspaper witti- 
cism. A Virginia gentleman was to meet Booker 
T. Washington for the first time. He deliberated 
within himself as to how he should address him. 
“Booker” would be too familiar. Mr.” would 
be too formal. “Professor” was the correct solu- 
tion. This dubious title fits shoe-black, dancing- 
master, tonsorial artist, or college teacher. One 
may rise from our ranks to be Governor of a State 
or President of a Nation, but when being criti- 
cized he cannot escape being dubbed “Profes- 
sor.” So we are not the leaders in social progress 
that we might be. As a profession we seem to be 
largely out of touch with the temper and the 
progress of the times. Ours are the virtues of 
imitation rather than initiation. Others lead, we 
follow afar off. We seem to be taking our orders 
from the dead lips of past generations instead of 
speaking new forms of life into being. We seem 
to be so busy conserving the rudiments of learn- 
ing that we are not thinking and acting. As 
artists we would fashion immature life while we 
ourselves are not abreast of mature life.

Self-criticism necessary 
Let us at least not have the fault of being blind 
to our own faults. At the same time, in reviewing 
our faults, let us not exemplify the fault of fault- 
finding. Our purpose is only to examine ourselves 
whether these things be so, that we may intelli- 
gently correct our weaknesses, and so make prog- 
ress toward our artistic ideals and toward a 
corresponding social influence. 
As I review my pedagogic sins for confession, 
they mount up to the deadly seven, as follows: 
pedantry, didacticism, methodastry (there is no 
such word, but you see, or will see what I mean), 
traditionalism, the omniscient air, gratuitous 
discipline, and academicism. I admit that, if the 
sins are as bad as their names, my conscience 
must be either callous or heavily burdened. Per- 
haps before launching into a detailed confession, 
once again I had better crave the pardon of all 
members of our class in proportion as they feel 
themselves not guilty.

  THE TEACHER AS ARTIST, 
Pedantry 
First, are we not in a measure pedantic? The 
pedant substitutes knowledge for wisdom. And 
the knowledge he has is without perspective. He 
has little sense of the relative value of different 
pieces of knowledge. The knowledge that makes 
no difference is pedantry, the knowledge that 
guides life is wisdom. Pedantry is a parade of 
intellectual wares; wisdom is knowing what is 
best to do and doing it. Montaigne’s essay on 
“Pedantry” is still modern. He says: “We can 
become learned by other men’s learning, but we 
can become wise only by our own wisdom.” 
One way to avoid pedantry is to consider con- 
stantly the uses to which knowledge may be put. 
Didacticism 
As a class have we not the didactic habit to 
excess? It follows us out of the schoolroom. We 
do not relax enough ourselves, we do not help 
others to relax enough. We criticize our amuse- 
ments. Instead of letting ourselves go at times, 
we inquire rather concerning the educative bene- 
_ fits of any undertaking. I am conscious of effort 
44
-P-A-G-E-57
SHRIVING AN INARTISTIC TEACHER 
in trying to forget at times that I am a teacher 
and read with a smitten conscience such a state- 
ment as the following from a clever article: 
“What man or woman of culture is so foolish as 
to seek the society of the average school-teacher, 
either for relaxation or entertainment?” ! Think 
of people avoiding us because they do not want 
to be taught; it is enough. I must try to leave the 
didactic habit behind me in the schoolroom, like 
a garment, and go forth into the world of human 
beings as a human being. If we could just be 
pupils when we are not teaching! Let us learn 
from those we meet, instead of seeming to insist 
that they learn from us. 
Methodastry 
Even in the schoolroom do we not also sin 
against artistic ideals by attaching a fictitious im- 
portance to method? Not that we can dispense 
with method, but that we cannot rely mainly 
upon it; not that method is unimportant, but 
1 The Point of View: “Confessions of a Pedagogue,” 
Scribner’s, April, 1908. This article refers to five of the seven 
faults here confessed. 
45
-P-A-G-E-58
  
THE TEACHER AS, ARTIST 
that it is not most importafit. We tend too often 
to serve rather than to use method. This is to 
worship what we ourselves, or others like us, 
have made. Our devotion to method tends to 
make our work mechanical instead of vital. A 
mechanical procedure runs off in a foreordained 
kind of way, being incapable of adjusting itself 
readily at each point to the needs of a situation. 
It puts routine into work. Methods we must 
indeed have, but as servants, not as masters. 
We must know enough not to follow the set 
method under certain circumstances, to-vary it 
according to need, to meet the situation in the 
best way as it arises, to have versatility, ingenu- 
ity, and individuality in our work. If we can keep 
ourselves vital under school conditions, we can 
more readily be vital members of society. If we 
can eliminate all artifice and unreality from our 
labor, perhaps we can be more human and natu- 
ral in our other associations. 
Traditionalism 
As a class are we not in bondage to tradition? 
We are among the conservative members of so- 
46
-P-A-G-E-59
' SHRIVING AN INARTISTIC TEACHER’ 
ciety. We teach what is known, the present and 
the past, mainly the past. The goal toward 
which we are, or ought to be, moving rarely 
comes within our ken. We have not awakened to 
our work as a great constructive effort to shape 
developing human society toward its true goal. 
Instead, we hand down traditional knowledge 
and socially standardized viewpoints. The school 
does not lead social progress, it hardly keeps up 
with it. It ought to be developing social leader- 
ship and not merely conservative following. We 
should communicate, not merely established 
knowledge, but also ideas regarding the end and 
means of social progress. Society requires guid- 
ance as well as information. 
Along with our traditionalism goes our lack of 
personal growth. Are we not rather unprogres- 
sive in self-culture? We know fairly what we 
have to teach, and there too often we stop. If 
promotion and increased salary depend upon 
study, we are more able to study. We teach 
rather from an accumulated store than from a 
growing acquisition. We sometimes retain old 
familiar texts instead of changing to newer and 
47  
-P-A-G-E-60
  THE TEACHER AS ARTIST _ 
better ones. Our ambition is bounded rather by 
our necessity than by our capacity. We know 
enough to teach our classes, why study any more 
at all? We lack too often the conception of a 
personal growth that is unending and worth 
while for its own sake. We lack too often the 
conception of merit independent of salary. Life 
to us is rather static than dynamic. Surrounded 
by growing life and vitality, we have almost 
ceased to grow ourselves. We can not move soci- 
ety because we are not moving enough ourselves. 
The omniscient air 
As a class are we not more conscious of our 
knowledge than of our ignorance? The known 
we emphasize and communicate; the unknown, 
which is far vaster, we scarcely realize. Pupils 
get from us too often the impression that we 
know it all and that there isn’t much left of 
value that is unknown. We assume that we know 
because we are supposed to know. We are afraid 
for some reason to show or confess our ignorance. 
Even a mistake of our own we are ashamed to 
confess and correct. We fear loss of respect from 
48
-P-A-G-E-61
  
SHRIVING AN INARTISTIC TEACHER 
our pupils. We have made the dreadful mistake 
of trying to live up to the reputation of being 
encyclopedic. Intellectual modesty is a fitting 
virtue in our world for even the wisest man. Our 
pupils would get more from us if we taught them 
less from our store and learned with them more. | 
Gratuitous discipline 
. Again, we tend to maintain a kind of gratui- 
tous discipline among our pupils. Our rules for 
order are based, not so much on moral principle 
as on what is convenient or not annoying to our- 
selves. Thus we keep pupils quiet, though work 
should sometimes mean noise. Thus we keep 
them motionless when bodily activity is good for 
thinking, morality, and health alike. Being often 
nervous ourselves, we force a regimen on them 
that tends to make them nervous. The discipline 
and order we maintain are likely to be based on 
our authority rather than on a sweet and univer- 
sal reason. We even go the length at times of 
denying our pupils the freedom they need be- 
cause it disturbs us. We make ourselves too 
much the center around which the class revolves 
49  
-P-A-G-E-62
  THE. TEACHER AS ARTIST 
as a satellite. We fail as artists because we do 
not develop freedom, initiative, spontaneity, and 
self-expression. Not being as complete person- 
alities ourselves as we should be, we make our 
pupils into our own image. Until we become 
better artists, we cannot shape life artistically. 
Academicism 
Perhaps the nadir of our weakness is that we 
are so exclusively academic. We move in a 
realm too apart from life. The world sweeps too 
much by, too little through, our schoolroom. We 
are safely isolated, insulated, within our four 
walls, if we will it so. Life is something we are 
supposed to prepare pupils for; it comes later. 
This we do, not so much by living as by talking. 
We spend our pupils’ time not so much in doing 
things as in saying how they should be done. A 
child is taught to say the table of cubic measure 
but he cannot measure a pile of wood with a 
yardstick. We have something we call a curricu- 
lum that children have to study; it is well-named, 
“a little race-course” around which we usually 
drive them at top speed out of sight of the world. 
5°
-P-A-G-E-63
  SHRIVING AN INARTISTIC TEACHER 
The antidote for academicism is vitalism, the 
living touch. The curriculum should interpret 
life with a view to its improvement. The school 
should itself be a miniature of the ideal society. 
Thus at length my confession is ended. These 
are faults enough, if not exaggerated, sadly to 
handicap the influence of our art. Perhaps the 
narration of the faults has been somewhat over- 
drawn, as one truly confessing a fault is likely to 
magnify it. If it be a nightmare here depicted, at 
least may it awaken us from our lethargy, and so 
have afflicted our souls to good purpose. 
After the confession the assignment of pen- 
ance. How shall we who recognize and confess 
our inartistic defects proceed to overcome them? 
This is the practical question. The penance will 
take the form of certain specific things to be done. 
Some of these have been hinted at in the course 
of the confession itself. The register of the pen- 
ance will include these items: the winning of a 
wider consciousness, the knowing of principles, 
cultivating esthetic appreciation, making an ar- 
tistic environment, communicating a personality, 
and possessing a soul. 
5I
-P-A-G-E-64
  THE TEACHER AS ARTIST 
The wider consciousness 
The teachers of the world are the artificers of 
life. We need to have, as Isaac Watts said of 
John Locke, “‘a soul wide as the sea, calm as 
night, bright as day.” We need the conception 
of the unity and goal of humanity. We must 
acquire a wider consciousness, one that is inter- 
class, interracial, and international in scope. 
With such a consciousness in the classroom we 
can become leaders in making individual and 
social living that divine thing of peace and prog- 
ress, health and happiness, labor and love, jus- 
tice and mercy that it should be and some day 
will be. 
Knowing principles 
And then, as regards our craft, we should know 
more thoroughly and apply more effectively the 
principles of teaching as an art in order to make 
it a fine art. As Aristotle says,1 
... Any one who wishes to become an artist in 
education and to know the theory of it must, it will

be allowed, betake himself to the universal and get 
to know it as far as that may be possible. And no 
doubt too every one that wishes to make people bet- 
ter, whether they be few or many, must try to learn 
the art of legislation, seeing that it is only through 
law that we can be made good. To produce a good 
disposition in any given subject submitted for treat- 
ment is not in the power of anybody and everybody, 
but only, if in anybody’s, in that of the scientific 
educator. 
Aesthetic appreciation 
We should learn to appreciate the works of fine 
art,—the best music, literature, sculpture, 
painting, and architecture. Some of our busy 
time and small income should be devoted to 
these greater matters of the soul, with a view not 
only to cultivating our own esthetic sense, but 
also to using in our own work the methods of the 
masters of art. As Herbart says,’ “The teacher 
should by all means study literary masterpieces 
for the purpose of learning from great authors 
how they escaped these difficulties ” (in securing 
attention).

lated by Lange and De Garmo. New York, 1909.

  THE TEACHER AS ARTIST 
Artistic environment 
Beauty, as Plato showed, is drawn into the 
soul through association with things of beauty. 
The continuous and relatively unconscious in- 
fluence of the schoolhouse must refine the nature 
of pupils. We must accentuate the growing ten- 
dency to have fine architecture in the school 
building itself, artistic and well-kept school 
grounds, handsomely decorated interiors in 
halls, corridors, and classrooms, and withal, we 
must show in our own appearance some evidence 
of esthetic feeling. 
Transmission of personality 
Such artistic taste and personality as we can 
by effort develop in ourselves, we must transmit 
by a contagious enthusiasm to our pupils. Not 
what we say, nor even what we do, but what we 
really are counts for most in the esthetic as well 
as other development of our pupils. 
As McLellan and Dewey say: ! 
The fundamental principle is that personality com- 
municates itself, that there is developed in the pupil 
1 Applied Psychology, p. 232. 
54
-P-A-G-E-67
  SHRIVING AN INARTISTIC TEACHER 
the same state of intellectual and moral conscious- 
ness that marks the teacher . . . he makes an attrac- 
tive subject still more attractive; he invests the in- 
different with newly discovered charms; he reveals 
an element of beauty even in what was dry and 
harsh; in a word, he makes the pupil love what he 
himself loves, and hate what he hates.... The de- 
spiser of classics becomes an enthusiastic student of 
Homer and Virgil; the hater of mathematics takes 
to geometry and the calculus; and the unimaginative 
plodder becomes saturated with love for the beauty 
and strength of Milton and Shakespeare. 
This statement may be somewhat unrestrained 
in its estimate of what the communication of 
personality may accomplish. The quotation to 
follow is speaking to the same point but in a 
somewhat more judicious and discriminating 
way. 
The New York Times of April 20, 1911, quoted 
in its editorial column the following from the 
brilliant French critic, Emile Faguet: — 
It is true that taste is incommunicable and that 
thinking cannot be taught. But if a teacher cannot 
teach his pupils to have taste, he can show taste in the 
55
-P-A-G-E-68
  THE TEACHER AS ARTIST 
presence of a hundred of them and excite them to its 
attainment; it is only an excitation, but it may be 
potent, and if he cannot teach them thinking, he can 
think in their presence and excite them to think for 
themselves, and it is only an excitation, but it is 
vital. 
Such teaching, to be accurate, is not teaching; it is 
intercourse; it consists in living intellectually with 
the young, who, on their part, are living intellectu- 
ally, and whom your intellectual life arouses, keeps 
curious and eager, and encourages. That is all. 
Possession of soul 
And, as fashioners of the future America, we 
must rise above the American standard of haste, 
bustle, and speed. Our teaching and the spiritual 
atmosphere of our classrooms too easily reflect 
the prevailing standards of American life. The 
school exists, not so much to conform itself to 
existing society as to transform existing society 
through its future members into what it ought to 
be. In the classroom those standards of poise, 
self-control, equilibrium, and patience should 
prevail in relation to which young souls may 
properly grow, and which are so conspicuously : 2 as

SHRIVING AN INARTISTIC TEACHER 
lacking from American society. Things of beauty 
are neither created nor enjoyed in record-break- 
ing time, but the spirit of leisure and free spon- 
taneity characterizes them. This does not mean 
that we are to be inactive when we should be at 
work, but it means that the spirit of self-control 
should animate even our busiest days. 
In these, and no doubt in many other ways, 
put upon ourselves, it may be, in the form of 
penance for inartistic shortcomings, we, as lovers 
of our profession, must help raise the art of 
teaching to the dignity, excellence, majesty, and 
joy of a fine art. 
It remains only to pronounce the word of 
absolution upon ourselves, who see our faults, 
confess them, resolve so far as possible to turn 
from them, and to walk more nearly in the way 
that is holy, because beautiful.

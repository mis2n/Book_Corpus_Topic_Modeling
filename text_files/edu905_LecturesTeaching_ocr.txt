PREFACE TO THE AMERICAN EDITION. 
ALrTHoucH eminent writers in both hemispheres have pro- 
duced works on teaching of superior merit, it must be ad- 
mitted that the literature of pedagogy is still in its infancy. 
There is no standard authority, as in law or medicine, to 
which all teachers can refer and on which they can rely. Her- 
bert Spencer and Alexander Bain have written excellent books 
on the theory of teaching; but they have said little or nothing 
on. the practice of teaching—hardly one word that would aid 
the young beginner in organizing and managing a school. 
Many able instructors in the United States, among whom may 
be mentioned Wickersham and Payne, have done good service 
in the cause of education by writing works of great value,— 
works more practical than any produced on the other side of 
the Atlantic except the work entitled Lectures on Teaching by 
J. G. Fitch. 
Teachers everywhere among the English-speaking people 
have hailed Mr. Fitch’s work as an invaluable aid for almost 
every kind of instruction and school organization. It com- 
pines the theoretical and the practical; it is based on psychol- 
ogy; it gives admirable advice on everything connected with 
teaching, from the furnishing of a school-room to the prepara

tion of questions for examination. Its style is singularly clear, 
vigorous, and harmonious; so that notwithstanding the dryness 
of the subject, even the layman can read it with pleasure and 
profit. Some one has said that it requires as much ability to 
govern and instruct a district school with justice and wisdom 
as it does to govern a State; and this thought must have been 
in the mind of Mr. Fitch when preparing his great work on 
teaching. His ideal schoolmaster must be a man of rare quali- 
fications, mental, moral, and physical; he must be the equal of 
any governor in the world. Mr. Fitch in his requirements for - 
good teaching honors the profession. He does not treat it asa 
piece of job-wark to which any half-educated person may turn 
his hand, but as a professional calling, which, according to 
Edward Everett, requires learning, skill, and experience. 
Mz, Fitch has avoided the mistake made by many writers on 
education who have devoted their attention to a special depart- 
ment. He has neglected nothing. From the Kindergarten to 
the higher branches taught in the common-school, he has 
touched upon every department of instruction, manifesting a 
thoroughness and comprehensiveness of grasp indicative of 
careful thought and wide experience. Teachers and parents, as 
well as those just beginning to teach, would find it exceed- 
ingly profitable to make Fitch’s Lectures on Teaching a sub 
ject for close and repeated study.

PREFACE. 
In 1879 the Senate of the University of Cambridge, in com — 
pliance with numerous mémorials from Hcad-masters and 
others, determined to take measures with a view to encourage 
among those who intended to adopt the profession of teaching, 
the study of the principles and practice of their art. In further- 
ance of this design a ‘‘ Teachers’ Training Syndicate’ was 
appointed, and that body shortly afterwards put forth a scheme 
of examination in the history, the theory and the practice of 
Education. The first examination under this scheme was held 
in June 1880. The Syndicate also resolved to provide that 
courses of lectures should be given during the academical year 
1879-80. The introductory course on the History of Educa- 
tion, and the life and work of eminent teachers, was delivered 
by the Rev. R. H. Quick in Michaelmas Term. In the follow- 
ing Easter Term, Mr. James Ward, Fellow of Trinity College, 
lectured on Mental Science in its special relation to teaching; 
and the second course, which fell to my own share, was de- 
livered in the Lent Term, and related mainly to the practical 
aspects of the schoolmaster’s work, 
It has been considered by some of those most interested in 
this experiment that this, the first course of lectures on the Art 
of Teaching specially addressed to the members of an English 
University, might properly be placed within reach of a some- 
what wider circle of students. In carrying out this suggestion, 
T have not thought it necessary to abandon the free and familiar

                          | iv Preface. 
  forms of address appropriate to a lecture, or attempted to give: 
to what is here said the character of a complete treatise. Nor 
did I deem it advisable, out of regard to the supposed dignity 
of an academic audience, to keep out of view those simple and 
| elementary considerations which, though usually discussed in 
their relation to the lower class of schools, lie really at the basis 
of all sound and skilful teaching whether in high schools or low.” 
Some explanation may seem to be needed of the nomencla- 
ture which is here used in distinguishing different classes of 
Schools. It would doubtless be an advantage to employ in 
England the same terminology which is adopted throughout 
the Continent, But the term “‘ Secondary School ” in France, 
Germany, and Switzerland covers al] the institutions which lie 
between the Elementary School and the University; and it is 
manifest that within these wide limits some further distinction 
is needed, in England at least, to mark the different aims of 
schools so far asunder as Winchester or Clifton, and a humble 
commercial school. Such phrases as ‘‘ Enseignement Supérieur” 
and “Enseignement Moyen” would hardly indicate this dis- 
tinction with sufficient accuracy, and I have given on page 48 
my reasons for thinking that the terms “‘ First, Second, and 
Third Grade,” suggested by the Schools Inquiry Commissioners, 
will not find permanent acceptance in this country. So I have 
been fain to fall back upon the words Primary, Secondary, and 
High School, not because I think them necessarily the best ; 
but because they mark with tolerable clearness the practical 
distinctions I have tried to make; because they are equally 
appropriate to schools for boys and for girls; and because they 
do not, like such words as Classical, Commercial, and Tech- 
nical, connote any theory defining the kind of study specially 
suited to a particular age or rank in life. 
It seems right to add that this book is not, and does not 
profess to be, a manual of method. Indeed it may well be 
doubted whether at the present stage of our educational ex-
-P-A-G-E-6

perience any body of rules whatever could be safely formulated 
and declared to be the best. Nor is it certain, even though the 
best conceivable methods could be put forth with authority, 
that more harm than good would not be done, if by them 
teachers were deterred from exercising their own judgment, or 
became less sensible of the responsibility which lies upon them 
of adapting methods to their own special circumstances and 
needs, I cannot regret, even though the book proves pro- 
foundly disappointing to those—if any such there be—who 
suppose teaching to be a knack or artifice, the secret of which 
may be acquired, like that of dancing or swimming, in a short 
course of lessons. All that has been attempted here has been 
to invite intending teachers to look in succession at each of the 
principal problems they will have to solve; to consider what 
subjects have to be taught, and what are the reasons for teach- 
ing them; and so, by bringing together a few of the plainer 
results of experience, to place readers ina position in which 
it will be a little easier for them to devise and work out 
methods for themselves. No one can be more conscious than 
I am of the incomplete and provisional character of these first 
lectures; but I cannot doubt that the University, in seeking to 
promote investigations into the philosophy and the practice of 
the teacher’s art, is entering on an honorable and most prom- 
ising ficld of public usefulness, and that, under her sanction, 
future explorers in this field will do much to make the work of 
honest learning and of noble teaching simpler, more effective, 
and more delightful to the coming generations.

LECTURES ON TEACHING. 
I THE TEACHER AND HIS ASSISTANTS. 
Tuar the University of Cambridge should institute a course 
of lectures on the Art and Method of Teaching is 
a significant fact in the history of Education in 
England. We have in this fact a recognition on high author- 
ity of a principle which has hitherto been but imperfectly ad- 
mitted, in relation to the higher forms of school life and in- 
struction, although it has been seen in most beneficial applica- 
tion to the elementary schools. That principle I take to be, 
that there is in the teacher’s profession the same difference 
which is observable in all other human employments between 
the skilled and the unskilled practitioner, and that this differ. 
ence depends in large measure on a knowledge of the best 
rules and methods which have to be used, and of the principles 
which underlie and justify those rules. It is easy to say of a 
schoolmaster “‘ nascitur non Jit,” and to give this as a reason why 
all training and study of method are superfiuous. But we do 
not reason thus in regard to any other profession, even to those 
in which original power tells most, and in which the mechanic 
is most easily distinguishable from the inspired artist. For 
when in the department of painting you meet with a heaven- 
born genius, you teach him to draw; and you know that what- 
ever his natural gifts may be, he will be all the better pro tanto, 
for knowing something about the best things that have been Introduction.

- . 
done by his predecessors; for studying their failures and their 
successes, and the reason why some have succeeded and others 
have failed. It is not the office of professional training in art, 
in law or in medicine, to obliterate the natural distinctions 
which are the result of special gifts; but rather to bring them 
into truer prominence, and to give to each of them the best op- 
portunities of development. And if it be proved, as indeed I 
believe it to be demonstrable, that some acquaintance with the 
theory, history and rules of teaching may often serve to turn 
one who would be a moderate teacher into a good one, a good 
one into a finished and accomplished artist, and even those who 
are least qualified by nature into serviceable helpers, then we 
shall need no better vindication of the course on which we are 
about to enter. 
It seems scarcely needful to reply to the contention of those 
Teaching who urge that the art of teaching is to be learned 
Bake be best by practice, that it is a matter of experience only, 
“ practice only. that a man becomes a teacher as he becomes a 
swimmer, not by talking about it, but by going into the water 
and learning to keep his head above the surface. Experience 
it is true is a good school, but the fees are high, and the course 
is apt to be long and tedious. And it is a great part of the 
economy of life to know how to turn to profitable account the 
accumulated experience of others. I know few things much 
more pathetic than the utterances of some Head-masters at their 
annual conferences, at which one after another, even of those 
who have fought their way to the foremost rank of their pro- 
fession, rises up to say, ‘We have been making experiments 
all our lives; we have learned much, but we have learned it at 
the expense of our pupils; and much of the knowledge which 
has thus slowly come into our possession might easily have 
been imparted to us at the outset, and have saved us from many | 
mistakes.” The truth in regard to the office of a teacher jg. 
that which Bacon has set forth in its application to the largey 
work of life,‘ Studies perfect nature and are perfected by ex. 
perience : for natural abilities are like natural plants that neeg

pruning by study. And ‘studies themselves do give forth direc. 
tions too much at large, except they be hounded in by experi. 
ence.” There is here, I think, a truc estimate of the relation 
between natural aptitude, the study of" principles and methods, 
and the lessons of experience. Each is indispensable, you can 
not do without all three, you are not justified in exalting one at 
the expense of the rest. It is in the just synthesis of these three 
elements of qualification that.we must hope to find the thor- 
oughly equipped schoolmaster, the teacher of the future. And 
of these three elements, if is manifest that it is the second only 
which the University can attempt to supply. She cannot hope. 
to give the living power, the keen insight into child-nature, 
which distinguish the born teacher, the man of genius from the 
ordinary pedagogue. The University does not whata 
need to be reminded that the best part of a teach. University, 
er’s equipment is incommunicable in the form of prove it. 
pedagogic lectures; and that when she undertakes to give a 
professional diploma to the schoolmaster, some of the most im- 
portant qualifications of the office—as zeal, faithfulness, self- 
consecration, and personal fitness—will escape her analysis and 
defy her power to test them. She is conscious of the inevitable 
limitations under which she works, in regard to this, as indeed 
to all other of the learned professions. It suffices for her to 
say that she will attempt to communicate only that which is 
communicable ; and to test so much as in its nature is capable 
of being tested, and no more. Nor can the University to any 
appreciable extent supervise the actual professional practice of 
her sons and daughters, or follow them into the schoolroom, 
the laboratory and the home, to see how well they do their 
work, and lay to heart the lessons which experience has to 
teach. But she can help to call attention to principles of teach- 
ing; she can record for the guidance and information of future 
teachers, the details of the best work which has been done 
aforetime ; she can accumulate rules and canons of the didactic 
art, can warn against mistakes, can analyze the reasons why so 
much of scholastic work has often been joyless, dull and de-

The Art of but the restless spirit of modern academic life; to

University. uneasy hankering after “‘fresh fields and pastures

to teach; and to supply the world with its teachers. The 
|| very title of Doctor, which marks the highest academic dis- 
tinction in each of the faculties of Law, Divinity and Physic 
implies that the holder is qualified to teach the art which 
i he knows.’ And if the experience of these later times has 
brought home to us the conviction that the art of communi- 
eating knowledge, of rendering it attractive to a learner, is an 
art which has its own laws and its own special philosophy; it 
issurely fitting that a great University, the bountiful mother 
whose special office it is to care alike for all the best means of 
numan culéure and to assign to all arts and sciences their true 
place and relation should find an honored place for the master- 
science, a science which is closely allied to all else which she 
teaches—the science of teaching itself. It is not good that this

(here the horizon is necessarily bounded, and where everything: 
is learned with a special view to the future necessities of the

those which make the lawyer or the divine. It is to the Uni-

his art, and at the same time to estimate them at their true 
value, it is to his University that he ought to look for guidance 
and it is from ‘his University that he should seek in due time 
the attestation of his qualifications as a teacher ; because that is 
the authority which can testify that he is not merely @ teacher, 
but a teacher and something else.

which is often felt by thoughtful people, and which dence not dis- 
is doubtless present in the minds of some of you, the study ol 
to the trial of the novel experiment in which we ™ethod. 
“who are assembled here are all interested. { Teaching is an art,

of mind.) The ways of access to ths intelligence and the con- 
sciencé of learners are manifold; different circumstances and 
intellectual conditions require different expedients. (Variety 
and versatility are of the very essence of successful teaching. } 
If by seeking to formulate the science of method, you encour- 
age the belief that one mode of teaching is always right and all 
others are wrong, you will destroy the chance of new invention 
and discovery, and will do much to render teaching more stereo- 
typed and lifeless than ever, And even if it be admitted that a 
perfect set of rules for practice is desirable and attainable, we 
are not yet in a position to lay them down; and any attempt to 
fix educational principles, and to claim for them an authorita- 
tive or scientific character, is at present premature, and there- 
fore likely to prove mischievous. This is an argument on which 
I, for one, should look with special seriousness, if it were not 
practically answered by every day’s observation and experience. 
It has been my lot to see schools of very different ranks and 
pretensions, from the highest to the lowest; and the one thing 
which impresses me most is that the schools under untrained 
persons, who have given no special attention to the theory of 
their art, are curiously alike. ; There is nothing more monoto:

professional preparation that one finds the same stupid tradi- 
tional methods, the same habit of telling scholars to learn in~ 
stead of teaching them; the same spectacle of a master sitting 
enthroned at one end of a room and calling up two or three at a 
time to say their lessons, while the rest, presumably occupied in 
preparation, are following their own devices. Let us dppeal 
on this point to the experience of other professions. Is it the 
effect of good professional training in medicine or in law to 
produce a hurtful uniformity either in opinion or practice? Is 
it not on the contrary true that the most original methods of 
procedure, the most fruitful new speculations, come precisely 
from the men who have best studied the philosophy of their 
own special subject, and who know best what has been thought * 
and done by other workers in the same field? So in teaching, 
the freshest and most ingenious methods originate with those 
men and women who have read and thought most about the 
rationale of their art. 
And if in this place we are in any degree successful in laying: 
Indepen- down principles of action, and in evolving a few of 
thought the simpler practical deductions from those princi- 
more impor- ples, the truest test of our success will be found in 
anyruies. bringing home to every earnest student the convic- 
tion that good teaching is not an easy thing; that those who 
undertake to call out the intelligence and fashion the character 
of children are undertaking to deal with the most complex and. 
wonderful phenomena in the world; that the philosophy of the 
teacher’s art is yet in its infancy; that the best results we are 
yet able to attain are only provisionally serviceable until they 
are absorbed or superseded by something better; and that it 
is part of the duty of every one who enters the profession to 
magnify his office, to look on each of the problems befofe him, 
in as many lights as possible, and to try by his own indepen- 
dent experiments to make the path of duty easier, safer, ang 
happier for his successors, < 
The question is often asked, ‘Is Education an Art or q 
Science?” and at present the answers to this question are not

ananimous. But in truth no compendious reply is possible. 
The object of Science is the investigation of princi- ‘Teaching 
ples, of truth for its own sake, considered as an bothan |

obvious that this view alone will not carry us very far. It may 
help us to analyze mental processes and laws of human devel- 
opment, but it may leave us very impotent in the presence of 
the actual problems of school-keeping and of professional work. 
And the object of Art is simply the accomplishment of a given 
result by the best means. Hence we are justified in speaking 
of Education as an Art, because it has a complex practical prob- 
Iem to solve. But this view of it alone would be inadequate; 
for in fact teaching is both an Art and a Science. It aims at 
the accomplishment of a piece of work, and is therefore an Art. 
It seeks to find out a rational basis for such rules as it employs, 
and is therefore a Science. Down very deep at the root of all 
our failures and successes there lie some philosophic truths— 
it may be of ethics, or of physiology, or.of psychology—which 
we have either heeded or disregarded, and the full recognition 
of which is needed to make us perfect teachers. The more 
these underlying truths are brought to light the better; and it 
is satisfactory to know that the University has made other and 
very effective provision for the discussion both of the phi-' 
losophy and the history of the teacher’s work. Here however 
our task is humbler. We have to gather together a few of the 
plainer lessons of experience, and to apply them to the actual 
requirements of the class-room and the school. Yet, if while 
thus regarding Education as an Art we lose sight of the fact 
that it is also a Science, we shall be in danger of becoming 
empirics, and of treating our work as if it were a mere knack, 
a collection of ingenious artifices for achieving a certain desired 
end. This is a danger not less real than would be incurred by 
those who in their zeal to vindicate the claims of Education to 
the name and character of a Science resolved it merely into a 
series of speculations into the relative value of different forms 
of human knowledge, or into the constitution of the human

must remember that it is an Applied Science, whose principles 
are largely derived from experiment and observation, and need. 
to be constantly reduced to practice and brought to the test of 
utility. And we on the other hand who are seeking for some 
rules and counsels by which we may guide our practice and 
economize our resources must not forget that such rules and 
counsels have no claim upon our acceptance, except in so far 
as they have their origin in a true philosophy, and can be justi- 
fied by reason and by the constitution of human nature.

the full significance of this obvious maxim is al- ample and

teach the whole, or even the half of what he knows. There 
is a large percentage of waste and loss in the very act of 
transmission, and you can never convey into another thind 
nearly all of what you know or feel on any subject. (Before 
you can impart a given piece of knowledge, you yourself must 
7 not only have appropriated it, you must have gone beyond it 
and all round it; must have seen it in its true relations to other 
facts or truths; must know out of what it originated, and to 
what others it is intended to lead) A person cannot teach a 
tule of Arithmetic—say division—intelligently, without having 
himself mastered many advanced rules, nay, without some 
. knowledge of Algebra as well. Your own experience, if you 
watch it, will force this truth upon you. You hear a story, or 
you receive an explanation of a new fact. The thing seems 
perfectly intelligible to you, and you receive it with satisfaction 
and without a suspicion that anything more is wanting. But 
you try to tell the story or reproduce the explanation, and you 
find quite unexpectedly that there are weak points in your 
memory, that something or other which did not seem necessary 
when you were receiving it is necessary to your communicat- 
ing it: and that this something lies outside and beyond the 
truth or incident itself. Or you are giving a lesson on some 
subject on which your information is limited, or has been 
specially prepared for the occasion, and you give it under a 
consciousness that you are very near the boundary of your own 
knowledge, and that if certain further explanations were asked 
for you could not supply them. Is it not true that this latent 
consciousness begins to show itself in your teaching; that you 
falter and speak less positively, and that your scholar who 
shows curious acuteness in discerning whether you are speak- 
ing from a full mind or not finds out the truth directly, and so”

+ your lesson is a failure? And the moral of this is that if a cer- 
tain amount of accuracy, or a certain strength of conviction, is 
necessary for a learner, much greater accuracy, and a still 
stronger conviction, is needful for the teacher: if you want to 
teach well the half of a subject, know first for yourself the 
whole or nearly the whole of it: have a good margin of thought 
and of illustration in reserve for dealing with the unexpected.

lesson, and Jook well before beginning, not only at the thing you 
want to teach, but at as much else as possible of what lies near

And if this be true there arises the necessity for looking 
. into ourselves and carefully gauging our resources 
Preparation, before we begin to give even the humblest lesson. 
Before undertaking a matter so simple as hearing a class read, 
we should glance over the passage and determine on what 
words it will be well to dwell by way of explanation and what 
form of illustration should be brought to bear upon it. Even 
if you are going to give an exposition of a rule in Arithmetic, 
or of the use of the Ablative, it is wise to select beforehand and 
mentally to rehearse your illustrative examples; to see that the 
instances chosen have no irrelevant factors in them, but are 
calculated to furnish the most effective examples of the particu- 
Jar truth which you wish to explain, However simple the 
subject of a lesson, it is never so good when unpremeditated 
as it would be with a little pre-arrangement and forethought. 
And for all lessons which do not lie in the ordinary routine, 
the careful preparation of notes is indispensable; it is only by 
such preparation that you can determine how much can fairly 
be attempted in the prescribed time, what is the order in which 
the parts should be taken up, how they should cohere, at what 
points you should recapitulate, and how you can give unity 
and point to the general impression you desire to leave.

by others who are receiving knowledge for the first time. It is 
by the act of acquiring, and by watching the process by which 
you yourself acquire, that you can help others to acquire. It 
is not intended by this that the thing thus acquired should be 
merely a greater store of what may be called school learning, 
or of what has a conscious and visible bearing on the work ‘of

Mathematics, History, Philology are constantly subject to 
new developments, are stretching out into new fields, and be- 
coming capable of new and unexpected applications to the 
needs and to the business of life. There should never be a 
time in the history of a teacher at which, even in regard to 
these purely scholastic subjects, he is content to say, “‘I know 
now all that needs to be known for my purpose, I have an 
ample store of facts and illustrations at my command, and 
Imay now draw freely upon it.” Still the question, ‘‘ What 
has this or that study to do with the main business of my life? 
How far will this kind of reading tell upon my professional 
work in school?” though it naturally occurs to a conscientious 
man, is narrowing and rather ignoble. The man is something

doubt; but life needs a circumference as well as a centre, and 
that circumference is made up of sympathies and tastes which 
are extra-professional. And in relation to the tastes and read- 
ing of your own leisure I would say: When your more strictly 
professional work is done, follow resolutely your own bent; 
cultivate that side of your intellectual life on which you feel 
that the most fruitful results are to be attained, and do not sup- 
pose that your profession demands of you a cold and impartial

                26 The Teacher and his Assistants. 
  interest in all truth alike, or that what to others is a solace and. 
delight, to you is to‘be nothing but so much stock in trade. If 
when I see a school, and ask the teacher what is its special 
feature, or in what subject the scholars take most interest, he 
replies, ‘‘O, there is nothing distinctive about our course, we 
pay equal attention to all subjects,” I know well that his heart 
is not in his work, Kor over and above the necessary and 
usual subjects every good school ought to reflect in some way 
the special tastes of the teacher. The obvious demands of 
your profession and of the public must first be satisfied. And 
when they are satisfied, one mind will be drawn to the exact 
sciences, another to poetry and the cultivation of the imagina- 
tive faculty, another to the observation of the phenomena of 
nature, a fourth to the sciences of history and of man. Be 
sure that no study thus honestly and affectionately pursued can. 
be without important bearings on your special work. Every- 
thing you learn, even in matters like these, will tell in ways 
you little suppose on the success of your lessons, will furnish 
happy digressions, or will suggest new illustrations. “Tout 
est dans tout,” said Jacotot, by which I suppose he meant that 
all true knowledge is nearly akin, and that any one fact hon- 
estly acquired sheds light on many others, and makes every 
other fact easier to acquire. The one thinggou dread most in 
your pupils, dread most in yourself—stagnation, acquiescence 
in routine, torpor of mind, indifference to knowledge. When 
your own soul loses the receptive faculty, ceases to give a joy- 
ous welcome to new truth, be sure you have lost the power of 
stimulating the mental activity of others, or of instructing them 
to any real purpose, 
Old Roger Ascham in his Scholemaster, the oldest educa- 
tional book in England, describes his ideal student and teacher 
as Philoponos, ‘‘one who hath lust to labour,” and Zetetikoa, 
‘fone that is always desirous to search out any doubt, not 
ashamed to learn of the meanest, nor afraid to go to the great. 
est, until he be perfectly taught and fully satisfied.” Ana 
these qualities are still as indispensable as ever. There must

be in the perfectly successful teacher a love of work for its own 
sake,’ The profession is no doubt laborious; but as it has been 
well said, ‘It is not labor, but vexation that hurts a man,” 
Trouble comes from mismanaged labor, from distasteful labor, 
from labor which we feel ourselves to be doing ill, but nat 
from labor itself when it is well organized and successful) 
Then there arises a positive delight in the putting forth of 
power, and in the sense that difficulties are being overcome. 
Familiar as the truth is, it is worth reiterating that while 
teaching is one of the professions which most tries 
the patience, it is one in which the maintenance 
of a cheerful and happy temper is most essential) Some of us 
are conscious of a tendency to hasty unguarded words, to petu- 
lance, and to sudtlen flashes of injustice. Such a tendency may 
become a great misfortune to a teacher, and lead to conse- 
quences he may regret all his life. And I have known those 
who, having chosen the vocation of a teacher and being at the 
same timeaware of their own infirmity in this respect, have so 
guardéd and watched themselves, that their profession has be- 
come to them a means of moral discipline, and has sweetened 
‘and ennobled tempers naturally very hasty or very sour. But 
be this as. it may,funless we are prepared tq, take some pains 
with ourselves and cultivate patience and forbearance, we are 
singularly out of place in the profession of schoolmaster.. We 
awant patience, because the best results of teaching come very 
slowly; we want habitual self-command, because if we are im- 
pulsive or variable and do not obey our own rules we cannot 
hope scholars will obey them) Chronic sullenness or acerbity 
of temper makes its possessor unhappy in any position, but it is 
a source of perpetual irritation and misery in a school. “ That 
boy,” said Dr. Johnson when speaking of a sulky and unhappy 
looking lad, ‘‘looks like the son of a schoolmaster, which is 
one of the very worst conditions of childhood.- Such a boy 
has no father, or worse than none, he never can reflect on his 
parent, but the reflection brings to his mind some idea of pain 
inflicted or of sorrow suffered.” Poor Johnson’s own scholas- ‘Temper.

tic experiences, which, both as learner and as teacher, had not 
been delightful ones, led him no doubt to an exaggerated view 
of the misery of school-keeping as he had scen it, But he did 
not exaggerate the mischievous effect of a régime of brute force, 
and of a hard and ill-tempered pedagogue on the character of a 
child. Injustice breeds injustice. Every act of petulance or 
ill-temper will have some effect in deteriorating the character 
of the pupils, and will be reprodyced in their own conduct 
towards their juniors or inferiors. (Dr. Channing has well said 
that “a boy compelled for six hours a day to see the counte- 
nance and hear the voice of a fretful, unkind, hard or passion- 
ate man is placed in a school of vice.” 
‘The need of constant cheerfulness on the part of a teacher be- 
comes more apparent when we consider the nature 
of childhood. In some professions an artificiad 
gravity of demeanor is not inappropriate. The clergyman or 
the surgeon has much to do at the bedside, in the house of 
mourning, with the sick and the suffering, where anything ap- 
proaching to levity would often be unbecoming. But the in- 
tercourse of a teacher is with the young, the strong and the 
happy, and he makes a great mistake if he thinks that a severe 
and forbidding manner is required by the dignity of his call- 
ing. <A good fund of animal spirits puts the teacher at once 
into sympathetic rapport with his pupils, because it shows them. 
that seriousness of purpose need not mean dulness, and that the 
possession of learning is not incompatible with a true enjoyment, 
of life. We uvust not forget that to a little child the teacher ig 
the possessor of unfathomable erudition, the representative an@ 
embodiment of that learning which he himself is being urged 
to acquire, And if he sees that the acquirement of it hag 
rather made the teacher’s life gloomy than bright or joyous, 
he may not put his inference into the formof a proposition, but 
he will none the less surely acquire a dislike for knowledge, 
and arrive at the conclusion that it cannot be such a cheering 
and beautiful thing after all. (It is well known that the men 
snd women most influential in the schoolroom are those who Cheerfulness,

know how to share the enjoyment of their scholars in the play- 
ground; who at least do not frown at children’s play, but show 
an interest in it, recognize it as a proper and necessary employ- 
ment of time, and indeed can play heartily themselves when 
the proper occasion comes. Many of the influences which sur. 
round a teacher’s life have a special tendency to encourage a 
sedentary and physically inactive habit, and it is also observ- 
eble that persons are not unfrequently attracted to the profes- 
sion of teaching because they are not strong, and are studiously 
inclined. But it ought never to be forgotten that bodily activ- 
ity isa very valuable qualification in a teacher and should be 
cultivated as far as possible; nof rapidly lost as it too often is, 
That eminent schoolmaster showed a true appreciation of his 
work who said, ‘‘ Whenever the day comes in which I find I 
cannot run upstairs three at a time I shall think it high time 
to retire.” 
And among other merely physical qualifications necessary in 
a teacher one cannot overlook the need of great Quick per- 
- quickness both of eye and of ear,) These are in- ception of eye 
dispensable, In standing before a class, whether of ear. 
“it be large or small, it is essential to stand so that every mem- 
ber of it should be brought into focus so to speak, that the eye 
should take in all that is going on, and that no act or move- 
ment should escape notice. Iam more and more struck, as I 
Jook at schools, with the importance of this. I often see teach- 
ers who either place themselves so that they cannot see every 
pupil, or who, by keeping the eye fixed either on the book or 
on one particular part of the class, fail to check indifference or 
inattention simply because thcy do not see it and are not in- 
stantly conscious of it. No real intellectual drill or discipline 
is possible in such a class. It is‘a great thing therefore to cul- 
tivate in yourself the habit of glancing rapidly, of fixing the 
gaze instantly on any child who is wandering or disobedient, 
and applying a remedy without delay. And the need for a 
remedy will steadily diminish as your own vigilance increases.

dering look, every carelessly written letter in a copy is sure to- 
be at once recognized by your quick glance, and they will cease 
very soon to give you much to detect. But Jet them see always 
before them a heavy eye, an unobservant manner, which per- 
mits let us say two out of every three faults to pass undiscov- 
ered, and they are skilful enough in the doctrine of chances to | 
know well in effect what this means. It means that the prob- 
ability is two to one against the detection of any given fault, 
and you will find that in this way, the chances being largely in 
favor of the disobedient one, disobedient acts will be multiplied 
in far greater proportion still. The teacher’s ear too should be 
trained toa sensitive perception of all discordant or unpermitted 
sounds. It should be acute to distinguish between the legiti- 
mate noise of work and the noise which impedes work or is in- 
consistent with it. Obvious as this is, many school masters and 
mistresses waste much time and add greatly to the difficulties 
of their duty by disregarding it. Quick sensibility, both of 
ear and of eye, are special natural gifts with a few; but they 
may be acquired with the help of cultivation, even by those 
who have not, been gifted by nature, if they only believe them 
to be worth having and take a little pains to obtain them. I 
may add that if a teacher possesses enough knowledge of the 
art of drawing to enable him to make impromptu rough dia- 
grams illustrative of his lessons, the accomplishment is one 
which will add much to his effective power. 
And may we not enumerate among the physical attributes 
Voice. which go to make a perfect teacher, a gentle and 
. yet an authoritative voice? There is necessarily a 
great expenditure of voice in teaching, and it is of much im-. 
portance to know how to economize it. As years go on, those 
whose profession obliges them to talk much ore rotundo begin 
to find the vocal organs weak and overworked, and to regret: all 
useless exertion of vocal power. And thus it should be borne 
in mind from the first that simply from the point of view of 
one’s bodily health it is not good to shout or cry or lift up the 
voice unnecessarily. It is a great point in what you may cal}

a low tone not only effects as much asa loud one, but it actually 
effects jore. ‘The key at which the teacher's voice is habitually 
Pitched determines the tone of all the school work, Children 
will all shout if you shout. On the other hand, if you deter- 
mine never to raise your voice when you give a command they 
will be compelled to listen to you, and to this end to subjugate 
their own voices habitually, and to carry on all their work in 
quietness, The moral effect of this on the character of the 
pupils is not insignificant, A noisy school is one in which a 
great opportunity of civilizing and softening the manners is 
habitually lost. And a school whose work is always done on‘a 
Jow tone is one in which not only is the teacher healthier, ana 
better able to economize the resources of his own life, but as a 
place of moral discipline it is far more effective. 
Touching the matter of speech, which among the minor con- 
ditions of effective and happy school-keeping is of edantry 
far more significance than it may at first appear, . 
Ishould like to add that some teachers seem to think it neces- 
sary to affect a studied precision in language, and to cultivate 
little crotchets as to elegant pronunciation which are unknown 
outside of the school world. ‘The perfection of language is the 
perfection of a transparent glass; it is the virtue of self-efface- 
ment, By it and through it one mind should look right into 
another and see exactly the thing which has to be seen; but if 
the medium is itself visible, if it challenge attention to itself, it 
is, in just that degree, an imperfect medium, and fails to fulfil 
its highest purpose. Ars est celare artem, The moment our 
speech becomes so precise and so proper that its precision and 
propriety become themselves noticeable things, that moment 
we cease to be good speakers in the best sense of the word. 
Ours is the one profession in which there is the greatest tempta- 
tion to little pedantrios of this kind, and it may therefore not be 
unfitting to refer to it. He whose speech or manner proclaims 
him to he a schoolmaster is not yet a perfect adept in his art,

‘We may not conceal from ourselves that in society those whose 
manners and speech betray them thus are not popular, and that 
they are not unfrequently spoken of as pedants. Now what is 
it to be a pedant? It is to have our vision so narrowed by the 
particular duty we have in hand that we sec it and other peoples’ 
duties, so to speak, in false perspective, and mistake the relative 
importance of our own doings and theirs. In this sense there 
are pedants in all professions, and it must be owned that they 
are often the people most devoted to their work. But the pro- 
fession of teaching is more often credited with this particular 
vice than any other, and for a very obvious reason. ‘‘We are {| 
hever at our ease,” says Charles Lamb, “‘in the presence of a k 
schoolmaster, because we know he is not at his ease in ours. | 
He comes like Gulliver from among his little people, and he 
cannot fit the stature of his understanding to yours. He is so 
used to teaching that he wants to be teaching you.” The truth 
To be cor- is that the one exceptional circumstance of a 
rected by lib- teacher’s life, the necessity of passing many hours 
eral stu a day with those who know so much less than 
“ourselves, and who, because of their own youth and ignorance, 
look up to us as prodigies of learning, is very unfavorable to a 
perfectly just estimate of ourselves, and is calculated to make 
us put a higher value than it deserves on the sort of knowledge 
which gives us this accidental ascendency over the little people. 
We ought to know this and to be on our guard against it. And 
_ after all, if there be a certain faulty tone of mind and character 
produced by the habit of spending much time with our intel- 
lectual inferiors, the true remedy is obvious; it is to take care 
that out of school we spend our time as much as possible with 
our intellectual superiors, We may seek them in society, or if 
they are not easily accessible there, we may always have re- 
course to the great silent companions of our solitude, the wise 
and the noble who speak to us from our libraries, and in whose 
presence we are no longer teachers, but reverent disciples. 
Another corrective to the special danger of the scholastie 
profession is to have some one intellectual interest—some favor.

ite pursuit or study—which is wholly unprofessional, and 
bears no visible relation to school work, I have 
known many teachers who have been saved from work out of 
the narrowness and pedantry to which their duties School, 
would have inclined them, by their Jove of archeology of art, 
or their interest in some social or public question. This extra- 
scholastic interest has brought them into contact with other 
people whom they meet on equal terms; it has helped them to 
escape from the habit of using the Imperative Mood, and to see 
their own professional work in truer relations with the larger 
world of thought and action, of which after all a school is 
only a small part. We all need, in playing our part in life, to 
perform some at least of it in the presence of an audience 
which habitually demands our best. : 
I have spoken of the necessity for laying all your private 
reading under contribution, and for bringing it to Power of de-

himself the rather rare gift of telling a story well. There are 
some who are good racontewrs by nature or by instinct, Thoy 
know how to seize the right point, to reject what is irrelevant, 
and to.keep up by their mode of telling it the hearer’s interest in 
any narrative they relate. But even those who have no natural 
aptitude of this kind may acquire it by practice, and such an 
aptitude when acquired is most serviceable in teaching. Watch 
therefore for good pieces of description which come in your 
way in books or newspapers, or for effective stories which you 
hear; and practise yourself often in reproducing them. Observe 
the effect of telling such a story when you give it to a class, see 
when it is that the eye brightens, and the attitude becomes one 
of unconscious fixedness and tension; and observe also when it 
is that the interest languishes and the attention is relaxed. A 
very little experience of this kind, if superadded to thoughtful- 
ness, to some care in the choice of materials, and to a genuine 
desire to interest the schoiars, will go far to make any one of

him a new and effective instrument for gaining their attention 
and for doing them good. 
There is indeed an abiding necessity for the application of 
Freshmoss ot fresh thought to every detail of school work. 
There is no method, however good, which dees 
not want to be modified and reconstructed from time to time; 
no truth, however true, which does not need to be stated now 
and then in a new form, and to have fresh spirit infused into 
its application. It is true of rules of teaching as of higher 
matters, ‘‘ The letter killeth, the spirit giveth life.” But even 
this is not the whole truth. For the spirit is constantly tend- 
ing to fix and embody itself and to become the letter, unless we 
are ever on our guard. We know how often it has happened 
in the history of religion that a great reforming movement, 
whtich has begun in the shape of a protest, and perhaps a very 
effective protest, against formalism and mechanical religion, 
has in time come to have its own watchwords and stereotyped 
usages, and has ended by being just as cold and unspiritual as 
that which it has sought to supersede. And this has been no 
less true in the history of education. The new thought, the 
bright rational method seeks to embody itself in a rule of ac- 
tion, While this process is going on, all is well. But when it 
is at an end, and the rule is arrived at, then comes the relapse 
into verbalism. ‘Routine is always easier than intelligence, 
And some of the most worthless of all routine is—not the 
traditional routine of the medieval schools, which is known 
to be mechanical, and is accepted as such—but the routine at 
first devised by enthusiasts, and afterwards adopted by dull 
uninspired people, who think that they can learn the method 
of Socrates, of Arnold, or of Fribel as they could learn a system

It is very touching to read M. Michel Bréal’s account of a visit 
to Pestalozzi, at the end of his career. He describes the old

grams and to the names of the qualities of objects, while the 
children repeated mechanically his favorite watchwords, which 
they had learned by heart. Those words had once been full of 
meaning. But they had ceased to represent real intellectual 
activity on the children’s part, or on his. They had become 
dead formulas, though he knew it not. And so it will ever be, 
with you and with me, if we lose the habit of looking at all our 
methods with fresh eyes, of revising them continually, and im- . 
pregnating them anew with life. It would be a melancholy 
result of the humble and tentative efforts which, under the 
encouragement of the University, we are now seeking to make 
after an Art of teaching, if by them any of us were led to sup- 
pose that it was an art to be acquired by anybody once for all, 
In truth, though we may enter on the inheritance of some of 
- the stored-up experience of others, each of us must in his own 
experience begin at the beginning, and be responsible for the 
adaptation of that experience to the special necds of his pupils, 
as well as to the claims of his own idiosyncrasies. and convic- 
tions. Nothing can ever be so effective as the voice, the enthu- 
siasm, the personal influence of the living teacher. Without 
these, apparatus, pictures, helps, methods, degenerate soon into 
mere processes and a sterile mnemonic, And no set of rules, 
however good, can ever release us from the necessity of fashion- 
ing new rules, each for himself. 
And it need hardly be said here that (he one crowning quali 
fication of a perfect teacher is sympathy—sym- . 
pathy with young children, with their wants and 
their ways; and that without this all other qualifications fail 
to achieve the highest results. The true teacher ought to be 
drawn towards the profession by natural inclination, by a con- 
viction of personal fitness, and by a wish to dedicate himself 
and the best powers and faculties he has to this particular form 
of service. That conviction, if it once dominates the mind of 
a person in any walk of life, does much to ennobie and beautify

called forth. There is no calling more delightful to those who 
like it; none which seems such poor drudgery to those who 
enter upon it reluctantly or merely as a means of getting a 
living. He who takes his work as a dose is likely to find it 
nauseous. ‘The good schoolmaster,” says Fuller, ‘“‘minces 
his precepts for children to swallow, hanging clogs on the 
nimbleness of his own soul, that his scholars may go along 
with him.” This mcans that he has enough of imaginative 
sympathy to project his own mind, so to speak, into that of his 
pupil, to understand what is going on there, and to think not 
only of how his lesson is being imparted, but also of how it is 
being received. But nobody can do this who is not fond of his 
work, That which we know and care about we may soon

It is obvious that in selecting assistants you should seek to 
find as far as possible those who possess the quali- Assistants, + . fications you would most desire in yourselves. 
It is also clear as the result of modern experience that the 
head teacher in every.school ought to be responsible for the 
choice of each of his own assistants, But having secured him, 
what is the best use to make of him? ‘here are two opposite 
views on this point. There is one which gives the assistant the 
care of the whole work of a class, and another which makeg 
him the teacher of particular subject and sends him from 
class to class to give lessons on it. Both systems may be seen 
in operation in very good schools, and it would be hard to say 
that all the truth lies necessarily on one side, or that one Mode

of dividing the labor is necessarily and always right. It is here 
as in governments: 
That which is best administered is best. 
One system gives scope for special ability, and assigns to 
each the work for which he is presumably fittest. But the dis- 
advantages are serious. In the first place, the teacher of one 
subject only—the French or Arithmetic master—is generally 
without influence. When a man confines himself to one sub- 
ject he is apt to see his one subject in a false light, and to lose 
sight of its relation to the general culture of the pupil, Per- 
haps too if he has a stronger will than his colleagues he demands 
proficiency in his one subject at the expense of others, The 
class system avoids this particular danger, but it has. the ob- 
vious disadvantage of setting each of your assistants to teach 
several subjects, of which it may fairly be assumed he can 
teach some much better than others, There must be a com- 
promise between these two systems. I believe that which in the 
long-run secures best the unity and coherence of the ‘school 
work is to assign to an assistant a definite portion of responsi- 
bility, not to move him about from place to place, but to attach 
him to a class for a sufficient time to make it clear that the pro- 
gress or backwardness of the class is to be distinctly attributed 
to him. Each assistant should be clearly identified with the 
work of particular scholars and mainly responsible for it. On 
the whole, a distribution of assistants among classes effects this 
purpose better than their distribution among subjects. Experi- 
ence is not favorable to the plan of making one teacher take 
the exclusive charge of arithmetic, another of writing, and 
another of literature. The class system calls out more varied 
power, prevents the mind of the teacher from always running 
in the same groove, and is more interesting to. himself. He 
wants a change of occupation and of subject as much as his 
‘pupils. At the same time, while this seems to be the best gen- 
eral rule, it is clearly important to utilize any special gift pos- 
sessed by an assistant and to find out in the case of every one
-P-A-G-E-39
  38 The Teacher and his Assistants. 
  such assistant what is the subject he can teach best, or in what 
work he feels most interest. If over and above his proper and 
ordinary work in his class, an assistant who is fond of drawing, 
or who sings well, or who is skilful in the book-keeping and. 
supervision of registers, has appropriate special work assigned 
to him,—work which belongs rather to the whole school than 
to the class,—such work will be a clear gain, not only to the 
school, which will thus turn all its best resources to account, 
but also to the assistant himself, whose interest in the prosperity 
of the school as a whole will thus be much augmented, 
So we may conclude from these considerations that on 
the whole the class-master plan should prevail in the lower 
classes, and the plan of employing specialists in the higher, 
but that the evils of too exclusive a dependence upon cither 
plan should be carefully guarded against throughout the 
school. 
Another form of compromise between the two systems suc- 
ceeds well in some good schools. To each class of from 80: to 
40 pupils two teachers are attached—a senior and a junicr. 
The class is divided into two for arithmetic, languages, reading, 
and a good deal of o‘va-evce questioning, and each teacher is 
responsible for his own section. For all lecture lessons the 
sections are thrown together and the class is one. The most important lectures are given by the senior teacher, others by the junior; but both teachers are present at all lectures, and 
responsible for seeing that their respective sections understand and profit by them, This plan has the further advantage of . putting a younger teacher under the supervision and practical 
training of an elder; and also of relieving the younger teacher 
occasionally for his own studies or for higher lectures, 
But though it is well to confide responsibility to assistants, 
Responsi- it is essential to watch its exercise carefully. The 
bili tobe principal teacher should hold frequent periodical

ployed by his assistant, and with the sort of influence he exerts. 
T once knew a large private school in which this was done by 
the cunning device of letting a small pane of glass into the 
wall of each class-room; and the principal prided himself on 
being able to pervade the whole establishment at all times, and 
peep in when it was least suspected. But this is not what I 
tecommend. It is not espionage, for this always destroys the 
self-respect of those who are subject to it. Nor is it the half- 
apologetic way which some head-masters have of coming into 
the class of an assistant with some pretext, as if they felt they 
were intruding, It is the frank recognition of such oversight 
as one of the conditions under which the work is to be done, 
and under which alone responsibility can be prop- yet concen- 
erly concentrated in the hands of the principal. trated in the 
It is indispensable that there should be wnity in 
@ school, that the plans and methods in use in the vartous 
classes should harmonize and be mutually helpful. And to 
this end the occasional presence of the principal in the lower 
classes should be part of the recognized order of the school. 
He will not interrupt or criticise of course in the presence of 
the scholars, He will in their eyes rather appear as in friendly 
co-operation with the assistant than as a critic. But he will 
criticise nevertheless. He will carefully note mistakes, negli- 
gences, and ignorances; and make them the subject of private 
counsel to the assistants afterwards, 
In many large schools, it is the custom to have every week a 
short conference among the teachers, in which gehoot 
they and the head-master compare notes and con-_ Councils. 
sult together about the work and about the pupils. Whether 
the number be small or great, some such comparison of ex- 
perience is absolutely necessary if the school is to be at unity 
with itself, and if its parts are to fit together. I once visited an 
Endowed Grammar School, in which the head-master and the. 
usher, both clergymen, both on the Foundation, both sepa- 
rately appointed, carried on their duties in separate rooms, 
They had not spoken to each other for fifteen years. The

head-master explained to me that the low state of his own de- 
partment was attributable to the worthless character of the 
preparation obtained in the usher’s class; and the usher, with 
equal frankness, told me that it was of no use to take any pains 
with boys who were to come under so foolish a régime as that 
of the Upper Department. These cases it may be hoped are 
rare, but instances of practical isolation, and want of harmony 
in the work of classes, are not rare, and I hold it to be indis- 
pensable that the principal of a school should know everything 
that is going on in it; and should habitually test and observe 
the work of his subordinates, not because he suspects them, 
but because thorough and intelligent co-operation towards a 
common end is impossible without it. 
No general rule can be laid down about the age of assistants; 
‘Youthful the whole question is a personal one, to be settled 
assistants. by the individual characteristics of the people 
within your reach, and not by any fixed rules. But I may 
confess toa strong sense of the services which may often be 
rendered by young teachers as assistants. Much experience in 
elementary schools of the working of the pupil-teacher system 
has not led me, as it appears to have led many others, to dis- trust that system, and to wish to see it universally superseded. 
by an organization dependent on adult teachers alone. You 
know that by the regulations of the Council Office, one grown- up assistant master or mistress is allowed to count as two pupil- 
teachers in assessing the sufficiency of the staff. They are about equal to one such assistant in pdint of cost, but I have come to the conclusion that in a great many cases the two pupil- teachers do more work than one assisiant. And I have no doubt that in secondary schools the system of student-teachers might often be adopted with much advantage, and that you may get very valuable work out of young people of seventeen or eighteen who are drawn to the profession by choice and aptitude and who wish to become trained for it. What they lack in maturity and experience they often make up in enthu- siasm, in freshness of mind, and in tractability. You can easily
-P-A-G-E-42
Youthful Assistants. 41 
  
direct them, and mould their work so as to fit your own plana 
Only it is worth while to bear in mind two or three conditions, 
They should not at first be put to the care of the youngest 
children. It is a very common fault to suppose that your 
rawest and least-trained teacher should be put to your lowest 
class, whereas it is in the lowest class that the highest pro- 
fessional skill is often wanted. To awaken the interest and 
intelligence of very young children is often a much harder task 
than to direct the work of elders. The easiest part of the work 
of a school is the supervision of the more mechanical lessons, 
such as reading and writing, or the correction of sums and of 
home exercises in the middle classes of a school, where scholars 
may be presumed to have already been drilled into good habits 
of work. And this therefore is the department of duty which 
should first be confided to a young teacher. The function 
which is known in the French schools as that of repetitewr, who 
has charge of the minor and more mechanical parts of the 
teaching, is the proper function of such a teacher, not the sole 
charge of any one department of a school. Then by degrees 
he may be called upon to give a lesson perhaps on some rule 
of arithmetic in the presence of a class, and afterwards to teach 
in succession other subjects properly graduated in difficulty. 
It is a mistake to exact so much as is often demanded from 
young teachers. While in the stage of probation or partial 
studentship they should not give more than half the day to 
teaching, and reserve the rest for their own studies. If we ex- 
pect a young assistant to spend the whole of the ordinary 
school-hours in charge of young children, and to pursue his 
own studies when school is over, we expect what is unreason- 
able, and we go far to disgust him and make him feel the task 
to be drudgery. On the other hand, an alternation of teaching 
and learning, of obeying and governing, is very pleasant to an 
active mind; and I think by trying the experiment of what 
may be called the “half-time system” the principal of a school 
may often get better, fresher work—work which he can more 
completely control and bring into harmony with his own views

and plans—out of student-teachers than out of adult ushers of 
the ordinary type. 
There is great advantage, whenever possible, in securing: 
Student- assistants of your own training, those whom you. 
ers, have manufactured on the premises, so to speak. 
And the system of student-teachers lends itself well to the 
adoption of this course. But we must not overlook the de- 
merits and dangers of this system on the other hand. A youth 
selected from among your most promising pupils, and trained. 
under your own eye with a view to taking office as an assistant, 
may indeed be expected to be familiar with your own methods 
and in sympathy with your aims. But it is essential that in the interval between the time of quasi-apprenticeship and that in. 
which he takes permanent office as assistant he should go out 
either to the University or to some other scheol for that impor- 
tant part of his education which you cannot give him. In the 
elementary schools young people are chosen early as pupil- 
teachers, go out at eighteen for two years to a training college, 
and return to an elementary school as assistants before they are 
qualified to take the sole charge of schools, In theory this is un- 
exceptionable. And if at the training colleges they were enabled 
to obtain a broader view of their profession and of life, little 
more could be desired. Unfortunately, however, at the Normal 
College they are associated only with others who have had pre- cisely the same training, who come from the same social class, 
and have been subject to the same early disadvantages. They 
are therefore from the beginning to the end of their career 
always moving in the same rut, always bounded by the tra- ditions and the experience of the elementary school, and they

But it is important that a substantial part of his training, at 
any rate, should be obtained in other places than the school in 
which he intends ultimately to teach; and among persons who 
are not intending to follow the same profession as himself,

of ayoung child. One hears much rhetoric and nonsense on 
this subject. The schoolmaster is often addressed by enthusi- 
asts as if he were more important to the body politic than 
soldier and statesman, poet and student all put together; anda 
modest man rebels, and rightly rebels, against this exaggera- 
tion, and is fain to take refuge in a mean view of his office. 
But after all, we must never forget that those who magnify 
your office in never so bad taste are substantially right. And it is only an elevated ideal of your profession which will ever en- able you to contend against its inevitable discouragements—the 
Weary repetitions, the dulness of some, the wilfulness of others, the low aims of many parents, the exactions of governors and of public bodies, the ungenerous criticism, the false standards of estimation which may be applied to your work. What is to sustain you in these circumstances, in places remote from friends, or in the midst of uncongenial surroundings? Noth- ing, except the faith which removes mountains, the strong con- viction that your work after all, if honestly and skilfully done, * is some of the most fruitful and precious work in the world. The greatest of all teachers, in describing his own mission, once said, ‘Iam come that they might have life, and that they 
might have it more abundantly.” And may we not without 
irreverence say that this is, in a humble and far-off way, the 
aim of every true teacher in the world? He wants to help his 
pupil to dive a fuller, a richer, 2 more interesting and a more 
useful life’. He wants so to train the scholar that no one of his

intellectual or moral resources shall be wasted. He looks on 
the complex organization of a young child, and he seeks to 
bring all his faculties, not merely his memory and his capacity

imagination, his taste, bis love of action, his love of truth, into 
the fullest vitality; 
“That mind and soul according well

No meaner ideal than this ought to satisfy even the humblest 
who enters the teacher’s profession. 
From considerations so high and far-reaching does it seem 
to you a rather steep descent 10 come down to the details of 
school organization, to books and methods, to maps and time- 
tables? I hope not, for it is only in the light of large princi-

heads, general and special. And before seeking to investigate 
the several subjects usually included in a school course, one by 
one, and the methods appropriate to each, it seems right to 
take a vue d’ensemble of the whole work of a School, and to ask 
ourselves what it ought to aim at, and what it cannot do. We 
shall not gain much from any preliminary speculation as to 
what Education is. Nothing is more easy than to define it as 
the awakening and training of faculty, the co-ordinate develop- 
ment of all the powers both passive and active of the human 
soul, the complete preparation for the business of life. In the 
view of many who have written on this subject there is no one 
element of perfectibility in the human character, no one attri- 
bute, physical, intellectual, or spiritual, which it is not the duty 
of a teacher to have in mind, and which does not form part of 
the business of education, We may leave for the present all 
such speculations. They are unquestionably true; because all 
the experience of life is a training, and men are educated from 
infancy to the grave, by all the sights and sounds, the joys and

which act on the young life from 7 years old to 15 or 18; 
and for a very limited number of the hours of each day. It is 
for a school to supplement other means of training, not to super- 
sede them; to deal with a part and not with the whole even of 
youthful life. It can never safely seek to relieve parents of 
their own special moral responsibilities; or to find for the child 
fit surroundings in the home or in the world, The teacher 
may properly sct before himself the ideal perfection of a life. 
He will do well to study Herbert Spencer’s description of the 
purpose of Education as a means of forming the parent, the 
worker, the thinker, the subject, and the citizen. But the 
practical question for him is what portion of the vast and intri- 
cate work of attaining such perfection is to be done in a school, 
and under the special limitations and conditions to which a 
professional teacher is subject. After all, he is not and cannot 
be to his pupil in the place of the parent, the employer, the 
priest, the civil ruler, or the writer of books, and all these have 
in their own way educative functions not inferior to his. It is 
well also to remember that some of the most precious teaching 
of life comes to us od¢fer, and without special provision or ar- 
rangement, while other knowledge can hardly come to us at all 
except we get it at school. We cannot therefore measure the 
claim of a given kind of knowledge to become a part of a 
school course, by considering’ merely its worth per se. We 
must also consider whether it isa kind of knowledge which is 
capable of being formulated into lessons and imparted by a 
teacher. For otherwise, however valuable it may be, it is for 
the purpose now in view no concern of ours. 
Now a school can operate on the education of a scholar in

intellectual and practical discipline which may be got by means of definite lessons, we may usefully take a brief preliminary 
view now. 
I suppose that if we seek to classify the objects of instruction 
(ehr-stof}), so far as they lie within the purview of a school- teacher, they are these: 
(1) The attainment of certain manual and mechanical arts, 
e.g. those of reading, writing, drawing, and music. Five det

use of physical powers, and in the solution of some of the prac- tical problems of life. 
Q) The impartation of certain useful facts—of the kind of information which is needed in the intercourse of life, and of which it is inconvenient, and a little disgraceful, to be ignorant. Such are the facts of geography, and history, and a good deal of miscellaneous information about common things, and about the world in which we live. It may be safely said that quite apart from all consideration of the intellectual processes by which knowledge of these facts finds entrance into the mind, and of the way in which it is systematized or made to serve an intellectual purpose, such facta are in themselves useful, and ought to be taught. 
(8) Language, including the vocabulary, grammar and litera- 
ture of our own and other tongues; and all exercises in the meaning, history and right use of words. 
(4 Pure Science, including Arithmetic, Mathematics and other studies of a deductive character, specially intended to cultivate the logical faculty, 
(5) Applied Science, including Natural History, Physics, 
Chemistry, and the Inductive Sciences generally. . 
Now under these five heads may be included nearly ail the 
secular teaching of a school; and I think we may rela- 
roughly say that, if you take the whole period of tive import- 
a child's school life, supposing it to be prolonged °"°* 
to the age of 18, the time would not be ill-divided if about one-

fifth of it were given to each. All five are indispensable. But 
the proportions of time which you give to them respectively 
will vary much according to the stage of his career which the 
child has reached. At first, the first, second and third will oc- 
cupy the whole time. As the arts of Reading and Writing are 
acquired, i.e. after the age of 8 or 9, practice in them will be- 
come less and less important; and in a year or two later, exer- 
cises in what may be called Art will only be interspersed among 
the lessons of the school as reliefs from intellectual labor. Thus 
more time will become available for the subjects of the second, 
third, fourth and fifth groups. And of these it should always be 
remembered, that the second is of the smallest value education- 
ally, and that in just the proportion in which you deal wisely 
and successfully with the other branches, the acquisition of in- 
formation about history, geography and common things may 
be safely left to the private reading, and intelligent observation, 
for which your purely disciplinal studies will have created an 
appetite. Moreover these classes of knowledge are not quite 
so sharply divided in fact as they seem to be in a theoretical 
scheme. Much depends on the mode of their treatment. For 
instance, much of the work dune under the name of arithmetic 
is often taught more in the nature of a knack, or mechanical 
art, than as a mental discipline. Grammar too, considered as 
the art of correct speaking, is matter of imitation rather than 
knowledge. And Physical Geography may easily, if well 
taught, become lifted to the rank of a science, and fall under 
the fifth rather than the third head. On the wholé, the 
staple of school. discipline and instruction will be found in 
the third, fourth and fifth groups, and you cannot go far 
wrong in allotting the best of the time, in the case of older 
pupils, in about equal proportions to these three departments 
of. intellectual effort. We shall have to consider more fully 
hereafter the reasons which justify the teaching of each of these 
subjects. At present, it may suffice to say that you teach lan- 
guage in order to enlarge a learner’s vocabulary, to give him 
precision in the use of words, and a greater command over the

resources of speech considered as an instrument of thought. 
And an ancient language which is fully inflected, a modern lan- 
guage which we learn for purposes of conversation mainly, and 
our own vernacular specch, all in their several ways conduce to 
the same end, though each has processes peculiar to itself. And 
we teach besides arithmetic some branch of mathematical or 
deductive science, because this furnishes the best training in 
practical logic, in the art of deducing right inferences from 
general or admitted truths. And as to the sciences which are 
not to be investigated deductively, but depend on experience, 
observation, and a generalization from a multitude of pheno- 
mena, we teach them not only because they make the student 
acquainted with the beauty and the order of the physical world, 
but because the mode of attaining truth in these matters corre- 
sponds more nearly than any other to the mode by which right 
general opinions are formed about all the principal subjects 
which for the purposes of practical life it behooves us to know. 
‘You can hardly conceive a completely educated man whose 
faculties have not been trained in each of these Their co-ordi- 
ways. But while this threefold division of studies ation. : 
may always be held in view, it does not follow that every one 
of them should be pursued uniformly and co-ordinately all 
through a scholar’s course. When elements have been learned 
and the scholar has got to the age of 18 or 14, you will do well, 
often in a given term or half-year to concentrate special atten- 
tion on two or three subjects, and for a while to do little more 
with some others than take measures for keeping up what has 
already been gained. It is unsafe to specialize too soon, till a 
good general foundation has been laid for acquirement in all 
departments; but when this foundation has been secured, it is 
@ great part of education, especially in the higher classes, to 
show what may be done now and then by a resolute and steady 
devotion to a particular department of work. It is only by doing 
so occasionally, and, in doing this, by sacrificing for a time the 
theory of proportion which ought always to prevail in your 
acheme of instruction considered as a whole, that you will give

to your elder pupils a due sense of their own power, and pre- 
pare them for that duty which is so often needed in after-life— 
the duty of bringing the whole faculty, and effort and enthu- 
siasm, to bear on one subject at a time. Do not be afraid there- 
fore of giving an extra proportion of time to Latin or to Litera- 
ture, or to Natural Science, when you find the pupils have just 
caught the spirit of the work and are prepared to do it unusu- 
ally well. For though relatively to the particular month or 
term the distribution of time may seem inequitable, it is not so 
relatively to the whole period of the school life. 
‘We have, in fact, to keep in view the general principle that 
every school ought to provide in its own way and 
measure, instruction and training of several differ- 
Schools. ent kinds—the practical arts, so that the pupil 
learns to do something, as read, write or draw; the real or spe- 
cific teaching, so that the pupil is made to know something of 
the facts and phenomena round him; the disciplinal or intellec- 
tual exercise, whereby he is helped to think and observe and 
reason; and the moral training, whereby he is made to feel 
rightly, to be affected by a right ambition, and by a sense of 
duty. But in applying this general view to different schools 
we must make great modifications. Whether a school is in- 
tended for girls or for boys, for young children or elder, for 
boarders or for day scholars, must be first considered before we 
determine its curriculum. And after all, the most important 
consideration which will differentiate the character of various schools, is the length of time which pupils are likely to spend in them. Roughly we may say that a Primary School is one the majority of whose scholars leave at the age of 14; a 
Secondary School, one in which they remain till 16; and a High 
School, one which may hope to retain them till 18 or 19, and 
tosend them direct to the Universities. The problem may be 
further modified by special professional aims and by the heces- 
sary differences in the training of boys and girls, especially in 
relation to the side of art culture; but mainly we may keep 
these three divisions in view. ‘The three kinds of

14 it is not too much to expect that the child of the poor man 
who is to earn his living after that age shall learn to read with

entific side of his training will be obtained through the elemen- 
tary study of mechanics or chemistry, or physiology, Hrdkunde 
or Naturkunde, and the esthetic side by vocal music and draw- 
ing, and the learning of poetry. And if to this can be added 
sufficient instruction in the elements of any foreign grammar, 
say French, to enable the pupil to pursue the study of another 
language than his own, by his own efforts after leaving school, 
the primary school may be considered to have done its work, 
and to have given him, relatively to the limited time in which 
he has been under instruction, a complete, coherent, and self- 
consistent course,

side of the humanities it should recognize the study of a few 
literary masterpieces, and some knowledge of the history of 
thought as well as of events. But it should not, in my opinion, 
attempt to include Greek, nor any exercise in Latin versifica- 
tion or composition; simply because it is not possible to carry 
discipline of this kind far enough within the limits of age to 
achieve any real intellectual result.

would be unsuitable in a shorter course. The scheme put forth

What is a “ Liberal” Education? 53 
  
as it goes, on the supposition that, except in the case of schools 
which are preparing for the University, there is little or no 
chance that the time of formal school instruction will be pro- 
longed. It is by losing sight of this, that we often commit the 
grave mistake of conducting the school education of a boy on 
too pretentious a plan, and on the assumption that he is to 
make a long stay at school. And the incomplete frustum of a higher course is not of the same value as the whole of a scheme of instruction which from the first has a less ambitious aim. The nature and extent of a foundation must be determined by the character of the superstructure you propose to build on it. 
The course of instruction should be begun with a reasonable 
Prospect of continuing it. Otherwise it may simply come to nothing, and represent a weary waste of time. 
And thus, we are to have in view, for schools of all kinds, an 
education which may well deserve to be called ‘And each in “liberal,” because it secks to train the man, and asense a, “lib- 
not merely the good tradesman or doctor or me- °F#!” course. chanic. What we may call the “real” elements of a school course, the acquisition of power to read and write and do cer- tain things, and the knowledge of useful facts, will form the largest proportion of the work of the primary school; while the formative clements,—those which seek to give general power 
and capacity,—language, logic and science, will be less promi- nent, simply for the reason that time is limited. But these higher elements should not be absent even from a course of 
instruction which ended at 10 or 11. And the reason why a 
High or public school course or a University course better de- 
serves to be called a course of liberal education than the other, 
is not because it neglects the “real” elements of manual arts 
and matters of fact, but simply because a larger porportion of 
its work is essentially formative and disciplinal; and because 
every year enables the student to give relatively more attention 
to those studies, by which taste and power and thoughtfulness 
are increased. From this point of view, it will be seen how 
unsatisfactory are such designations as ‘Classical’ school.

Realschule, or “Science” school, which imply that all the intel 
lectual training is to be of one kind, or worse than all “Com- 
mercial ” school, which implies that there is to be no intellectual 
training at all, but that the whole course shall be consciously 
directed rather to tue means of getting a living, than to the 
claims of life itself. 
And if this be the true principle to be kept in view in the 
‘The gra- gradation of schools, it follows that, except within 
dation of certain limits, we must not regard the primary as 
Schools. a preparatory school for the secondary, or the 
secondary for the high school. We need, no doubt, to con- 
struct the ladder of which we have so often heard, from the 
lower to the highest grades of public instraction. But it 
is a grave mistake to suppose that the highest step in a lower 
school. corresponds with the lower one in the secondary. 
Or to change the figure, the three courses of instruction— 
primary, secondary and higher—may be compared to three 
pyramids, of different sizes, though all in their way sym- 
metrical and perfect. But you cannot take the apex of the 
larger pyramid and set it on the top of a smaller. You may 
indeed fit on, with a certain practical convenience, the top of 
the higher scheme of education to the truncated scheme of the 
lower, provided you go low enough. If by means of scholar- 
ships or otherwise, we desire to take a promising pupil out of 
the elementary into the secondary school, it is not expedient to 
keep him in the first till 14 when the course is ended, and then 
transfer him for the last two years of his school life into a 
school of higher pretensions. He should be discovered earlier, 
say at 11, and placed in the higher school for a sufficiently long 
period to gain the full advantage of its extended course, And 
in like manner, if a scholar is to be helped from a secondary 
- school into one which prepares for the Universities, he should 
not remain to complete the school course, but should be cap- 
tured, and transferred at 14 or 15 at the latest. Otherwise it 
will be found that he has something to unlearn, that the con. 
tinuity of his school life is broken, that some of the books and

methods will be new to him, and that the conditions will not be favorable to his learning all which the more the “finish- 
advanced school can teach. This principle, if ie” School. once accepted, will it is clear prove fatal to the very prevalent 
notion that the higher or more expensive school qay be regarded as a sort of finishing school for pupils from the lower. There is still a theory, current especially among parents in regard to girls, that it is worth while to take a pupil from one school, and. send her for the last year to some expensive establishment to “finish.” I know -few more pestilent heresies than this—the notion that a little top-dressing of accomplishments is the proper ‘end of a school course. There is a great break in the unity and sequence of the schoo! career; and the new books and new 
aims come much too late to be of any real service, and indeed 
serve only to unsettle the pupil. When schools are rightly ‘graded each will have its own complete and characteristic course; and for this reason, it is only within certain limits, that 
is to say, about two years before its natural completion, that any one of these courses can be tightly regarded as preparatory to the other.* . In fashioning schemes of instruction, it is well to make up our minds as to the relative advantages of day Day and schools and boarding schools. In this part of our boarding island, a strong preference has long been felt for Schools. boarding schools; and it is believed that a more complete as 
well as a more guarded course of education is attainable in 
  
* The desire of the Schools Inquiry Commission was to make three grades of Schools above the primary: the Third grade for scholars who Would leave at 15, in which the fees should be £4 or £5 a year; the Second grade to take boys to 16 or 17, and to charge fees of £8 or £10; and the First grade to retain scholars till at the age of 18 or 19 they 
should be able to proceed to the University; and in such schools the 
fees might be fixed from £15 to £20 a year for tuition only. This theory has proved to be unworkable, (1) because, in fact, it separates three 
classes rather too rigidly, when two would have sufficed; and (2) because 
of the unfortunate use of the word “ grade,” which is popularly taken to 
connote social rather than educational rank. -

them than in day schools. In Scotland and in most European 
countries the opposite feeling has prevailed; and wherever good 
day schools are within reach parents prefer to use them, and to 
look after the moral discipline of their children at home; I be- 
lieve that this view is becoming more prevalent among us, and 
that the establishment of large public day schools in towns is 
doing much to reconcile parents, especially in regard to girls, to 
a method of training which a few years ago was generally 
regarded by the middie and upper classes as inadequate and 
just a little lowering from the social point of view. The dis- 
cipline of an orderly and intelligent home, and the intercourse 
with brothers and sisters, is itself an important part of education. 
But this cannot be attained; when three-fourths of the year are 
spent in an artificial community, which is very unlike a home, 
in which one’s companions are all of one sex and nearly of the 
same age, and in which the child is placed under the discipline 
of strangers who have no other than a professional interest in 
Home shoula bis progress. If we consider the matter well, there 
bea placeof is a sense in which the custom of relying on the 
work, boarding school implies the degradation of the 
home, It attaches the ideas of duty, order and systematic work 
exclusively to the school; and of leisure, license and habitual 
indulgence to the home. Now the highest conception of the 
life of youth regards both school and home as places of system- 
atic discipline, and of orderly and happy work. It is after all 
in the home that much of the serious work of men, and nearly 
all the serious work of women, has ultimately to be done; and 
the sooner this fact is made evident to the young scholar 
the better. No parent should willingly consent to part for a 
large part of the year with the whole moral supervision of his 
child, That so many parents do thus consent may be attribut- 
ed partly to the conviction of some, that they are unable owing 
to other occupations or to personal inaptitude to do the work 
properly; and partly to the love of social exclusiveness, which 
is a prominent characteristic and not the noblest characteristic 
of people in the middie and upper ranks. We all know that a
-P-A-G-E-58
Boarding Schools, 57 
  
day school is often spoken of as an inferior institution, one in 
which there will be mixture of classes, an object of special 
dread to the vulgar rich. With a truer sense of responsibility 
on the part of parents and truer notions as to the functions of a 
‘school, this difficulty is likely to become less seriously felt. 
The association of scholars from different ranks of life in 
classes and lessons, involves no real danger to the manners and 
habits of a child. On the contrary such association is well 
calculated to break down foolish prejudice, to furnish the best 
kind of intellectual stimulus, and to show the scholar his true 
place in the world in which he has to play his part. This prin- 
ciple is already widely recognized in regard to boys; but it is, 
for obvious reasons, not so readily admitted in its relation to 
girls, although it is not less true and sound in their case. Ere 
long, I hope it will be admitted even by the most refined of 
parents that, with reasonable care as to the associations which 
their daughters form oud of school, they may not only without 
risk, but with great advantage, permit them to share all the 
advantages of good public day schools; and need feel no greater 
misgiving as to the results of association for school purposes, 
than they do in respect to the meeting together on Sundays in 
the same place for public worship. 
In the boarding school, however, habits and personal associa- 
tions are necessarily formed. And since, partly The board-

parents, boarding schools will always exist, it is well to bear in 
mind that the reasons which render them desirable, and which 
should control their organization, differ much in the case of 
boys and of girls, The great public school has much to teach 
besides what is learned in the form of lessons, much which 
could not be learned by boys at home. It is a moral gymna- 
sium, an arena for contest, a republican community in which 
personal rights have both to be maintained for one’s self and 
respected in others; it should be a microcosm; atraining ground 
for the business and the struggle of life, and for the duties of a 
world in which men have to work with men and to contend

with men. Buta big conventual boarding school for girls is untike any world which they are ever likely to enter, It has no 
lesson to teach and no discipline to furnish which béars at all on the future claims of society and of home. Hence while the 
ideal boarding school for boys may be large and stately; with 
its strong sense of corporate unity, its traditions, its contests, its 
publicity, its representation on a small scale of municipal and 
political life; the ideal boarding school for girls is an institution 
large enough indeed as to all its teaching arrangements to admit 
of perfect classification, right division of duty among teachers 
and abundant intellectual activity; but organized, as to all its 
domestic arrangements, on the principle of small sheltered 
boarding houses in separate communities of not more than 20, 
each under the care of a mistress who shall stand in toco paren- 
és, And in each of such boarding houses it is well that care 
should be taken to gather together under the same roof scholars 
of very different ages, in order that relations of helpfulness and. 
Protection may be established between the elder and the young- 
er, and that in this way something analogous to the natural dis- cipline of » family may be attained. 
We may not forget too that all large boarding establishments

To what extent are the principles we have laid down con- sistent with a system of bifurcation, or division . 
of the upper part of the school, into two branches, Bifureation, 
according to the special bent or probable destiny of the 
scholars? On this point there has been much discussion, 
Even in the greatest and most ancient of our schools, it has 
come to be recognized that the traditional classical discipline is 
not equally suited for all the pupils; that what are called 
modern subjects—modern Janguages and sciences—have a right 
to recognition; and that for all boys who are not likely to go 
to the University, as well as for all who, when they enter an 
academic life, mean to pay special attention to science, an alternative course should be offered; and they should be per- 
mitted to substitute modern languages for ancient, or chem- 
istry and physical science for literature. And hence the es- 
ablishment in so many of the great schools of what.are called 
“modern departments,” or “modern sides.” It is impossible 
to declare that this experiment has been wholly successful. 
There is often a complete separation, say at the age of 15, of 
the boys in this department from those of the Modern de- “classical.” The “moderns” are “sometimes Partments. placed under the care of a class of teachers of inferior academic 
rank, It is understood that the work is rather easier, and that. 
boys of inferior abilities gravitate to it. So it comes to be re- 
garded as less creditable to belong to it; and those who keep 
in the ancient traditional groove, in which all the former 
triumphs of the school have been won, consides themselves 
not only intellectually but socially superior to those who avail 
themselves of the locus panitentia provided by the modern de- 
partment. What is worse, the masters themselves often en- 
courage this feeling, and let it be scen that they think the 
more honorable school career is to be found in exclusive de- 
votion to classics. We shall never give a fair chance to other 
forms of intellectual discipline while this state of academic 
opinion lasts. We shall, I hope, ere long come to the con- 
clusion that the true way to recognize the claims of what are

called modern subjects, is not by the erection of separate mod- 
ern departments, but rather by taking a wiser and more philo- 
sophical view of the whole range and purpose of school educa- 
tion. It is not good that the boy who is to be a classical 
scholar should grow up ignorant of physical laws. Still less 
is it good that the boy who shows a leaning for the natural 
sciences should be debarred from the intellectual culture 
which literature and language give. And it may well be 
doubted whether it is desirable to recognize too early the 
differences of natural bent, or probable professional career, at 
all. Up to a certain point, it is good for all of us to learn 
many things for which we have no special aptitude. Unless 
we do this, we do not give our faculties a fair chance. We do 
not know until our minds have been directed to particular 
forms of study, whether they will prove to be serviceable to us 
or not. You and I know many persons whose intellectual 
training has becn completely one-sided; scholars, ¢.g., who have 
never given a moment’s study to the sciences of experiment and 
observation in any form. With some of them, the result of 
this is seen in the lofty contempt with which they regard the 
kind of knowledge wlrich they themselves do not possess. 
With others, the result is seen in a highly exaggerated estimate 
of chemistry or civil engineering, and an absurd and ultra- 
modest depreciation of that form of mental culture to which 
they themselves owed so much. Both states of mind are mis- 
chievous. And they may be guarded against by taking care 
that our school-course gives at least the elements of several 
different kinds of knowledge to every learner. There comes a 
time, no doubt, when it is quite clear that we should specialize, 
But. this time does not arrive early; and until it arrives, it is 
important that we should secure for every scholar a due and 
harmonious exercise of the language faculty, of the logical 
faculty, of the inductive faculty; as well as of the powers of 
acquisition, and of memory. Let arrangements be made by all 
means for dropping certain studies, when experience shall have 
nade it clear that they would be unfruitful. Let German be

the substitute for Greek, or higher proficiency in physics be 
aimed at as an alternative to the closer perception of classic 
niceties. But you do not want distinct courses of instruction, 
existing side by side, to provide for these objects. And if modern departments are to exist at all in our great schools, they 
can only justify their existence by fulfilling these very simple conditions: 
(1) That the student of language shall not neg- Conditions 
lect science, nor the student of science neglect of their suc- 
language, even after the bifurcation has begun. CeSS. (2 That in each department, the same general curriculum including the humanities as well as science and mathematics shall be pursued; the only difference being in the proportion of time devoted to each, and possibly in the particular language or science selected, e.g. German for Greek, chemistry for ap- Plied mathematics. 
(8) That as far as possible, so much of the instruction as is common to the scholars in both departments—and this should be by far the Jarger portion—should be given to them in com- mon, and not in separate departments or by separate teachers. 
(4) That there shall be no pretext for regarding the modern course as intellectually inferior to the other; but that both courses should rank as equivalent, exact the same amount of 
effort, and should even from the school-boy’s point of view be equally honorable. 
Now how far ought this general scheme of division into five departments, of which the first two—the real— _. : 
gradually yield the chief importance to the other Girls’ schools 
three, the formative or disciplinal, to be modified for the sake 
of girls’ schools? Probably to a very small extent indeed. 
We may indeed postulate one special condition, for which we 
men have all good reason to be thankful, that a larger portion 
of @ woman’s life than of ours is spent in giving pleasure to 
others; and that to charm and beautify the home is accepted by 
her as the chief—one might almost say the professional—duty 
 
-P-A-G-E-63
62 The School: its Aims and Organization. 
  
which she feels to be most appropriate. Hence the greater im- 
portance in her case of some form of artistic training. The 
elements of instrumental music and of drawing should be 
taught to every girl; and these studies should be carried far 
enough to give her faculties for them a fair chance of revealing 
themselves, and to discover whether she is likely to excel, And 
as soon as it becomes clear, in respect to either, that she has no 
special aptitude, and no prospect of attaining excellence, the 
subject should be dropped. Nothing adds more to the charm 
of life than good music, but nothing is more mdlancholy than 
to reflect upon the wasted hours spent by many a girl in the 
mechanical practice of music, from which neither she nor any 
hearer derives real enjoyment. But this admission once made, 
and the just claims of art and taste as part of a woman’s edu- 
cation duly recognized, there seems no good reason for making: 
any substantial difference between the intellectual training of 
one sex and that of the other. The reasons which have been 
urged for a co-ordinate development of faculty apply to the 
human and not to any specially masculine needs. 
‘We are bound to make a practical protest against that view 
of a girl’s education which prevails so widely among ignorant 
parents. They often care more for the accomplishments by 
which admiration is to be gained in early years, than for those 
qualities by which it is to be permanently retained, and the 
work of life is to be done. In the long-run, the usefulness and 
happiness of women and their power of making others happy 
depends, more than on anything else, on the number of high 
and worthy subjects in which they take an intelligent interest. 
Some day perhaps we may be in a position to map out the 
whole field of knowledge, and to say how much of it is mascu- 
line and how much of it is feminine. At present the data for 
such a classification are not before us. Experience has not yet, 
justified us in saying of any form of culture or useful knowledge 
that it is beyond the eapacity of a woman to attain it, or that 
itis unsuited to her intellectual needs. Meanwhile the best 
course of instruction which we can devise ought to be put freely

within the reach of men and women alike. We may be well 
content to wait and see what comes of it; for we may be sure 
that no harm can possibly come of it. 
As to the distribution of time, it is impossible to lay down 
any rigid rule, applicable to schools of different Distribution

easily be given, but they would probably be very misleading. 
It may be useful, however, to keep in view some general direc. 
tions for the fabrication of your own time-table : 
(4) Calculate the total number of hours per week available 
for instruction, and begin by determining what proportion of 
these hours should be devoted respectively to the several sub- 
jects, 
(2) In doing this contrive to alternate the work so that no 
two exercises requiring much mental effort or the same kind of 
effort come together, e.g. let a lesson in translation, in history 
or arithmetic, be followed by one in writing or drawing; one 
in which the judgment or memory is most exercised by one in 
which another:set of faculties is called into play. It is obvious 
that the exercises which require most thinking should generally 
come earliest in the day. 
(8) Have regard to the character and composition of your 
teaching staff; and to the necessity for continuous yet well- 
varied and not too laborious employment for each of them; par- 
ticularly for those who are specialists, or teachers of single 
subjects, 
@ As a rule do not let any Iesson last longer than three- 
quarters of an hour. It is unreasonable to expect. continuous 
and undivided attention fora longer time, and with very young 
children even half an hour is enough. Thus a three hours’ 
school in the morning should be divided into four parts, and a 
two hours’ attendance in the afternoon into three. 
(5) An interval of ten minutes may fitly be provided in the 
middle of each school-time, for recreation in play room or 
ground. So a morning will give three lessons of three-quarters 
of an hour each, one of half an hour, which is quite long
-P-A-G-E-65
64 The School: its Aims and Organization.   
enough say for a dictation or a writing lesson, and a little 
break beside, 
(6) Let the plans be so arranged as to provide movement and 
change of position at each pause in the work. One lesson a 
day may very properly be given to the scholars standing. 
(% Let one short period be reserved in every day for the 
criticism of the preparatory or other lessons which have been 
done out of school. We shall sce hereafter that some forms of 
home lessons admit of very effective and expeditious correction 
in class, 
(8) Reserve also a short period, for some purpose not compre- 
hended in the routine of studies, say the last half-hour of the 
week, for gathering the whole school together, addressing them 
on some topic of general interest, or reading an extract from 
‘some interesting book. 
(9) Do not so fill up your own time, if you are the principal 
teacher, and have assistants, as to be unable to fulfil the duty 
of general supervision. Provide for your own inspection and. 
sxamination of the work of the several classes, at least once 
in every two weeks, and take care that the work of all youth- 
ful teachers, and of those who are not fully trained, goes on in 
your sight. 
(40) Punctuality should be the rule at the end as well as the 
beginning of a lesson; otherwise you do not keep faith with 
your scholars, The time-table is in the nature of a contract 
between you and them, Do not break it. The pupils are as 
much entitled to their prescribed period of leisure, as you are 
to your prescribed time of lecturing and expounding. 
I cannot tell you how much a school gains by possessing a 
thoroughly well considered time-table, and adhering closely to 
it. In the elementary school, as you know, the time-table once sanctioned and approved by the Inspector, and duly displayed, 
‘becomes the law of the school, and must not in any way be de- parted from. And I feel sure that you will gain by putting yourselves under a régime just as severe. For the habit of as. signing a time for every duty, and punctually performing every-

thing in its time, is of great value in the formation of charac- 
ter: And every good school is something more than a place 
for the acquirement of knowledge. It should serve as a disci- 
pline for the orderly performance of work all through life, it 
should set up a high standard of method and punctuality, 
should train to habits of organized and steadfast effort, should 
be ‘an image of the mighty world.” 
In separating a school into classes two conditions have to be 
fulfilleda—that the scholars shall be near enough in Ctassifica- 
ability and knowledge to work well together, to 
help and not hinder one another, and that there shall be a suf- 
ficient number of scholars in one class to secure real emulation 
and mental stimulus. A large school in which the ages range 
from 10 to 15 may for the former purpose have five classes. 
Indeed it may be roughly said that there should be as many 
classes as there are years in the school-life of the scholars. 
Otherwise, you will be mingling children in the same class 
whose attainments and powers differ so widely that either some 
of them will be held back, or others will be urged to progress 
too rapidly. On the other hand, it is essential that classes should 
be of a certain size, and I believe that every teacher who under- 
stands his business prefers large classes to small ones. There 
are advantages in the fellowship and sympathy which are 
generated by numbers, in the self-knowledge which the pres- 
ence of others gives to each, and especially in the stimulus 
which a dull or commonplace child receives from hearing the 
answers and witnessing the performances of the best in the 
class. And these advantages cannot be gained in a small class. 
In fact I believe it is as easy to teach 20 together as'10; and 
that in some respects the work is done with more zest and more 
brightness. So it will be seen that the two conditions we have 
laid down cannot both be fulfilled except in schools of a certain 
size. There is in fact an inevitable waste of resources and of 
teaching power in any school of Jess than 100 children; and a 
very serious waste in small schools of 20 or 80. In all of them 
you must either sacrifice the uniformity of the teaching, or you 
5 
         
-P-A-G-E-67
66 The School: its Aims and Organization. 
  
must, at considerable cost, have a teacher for every group of six 
or seven scholars, and in such classes must sacrifice the intel- 
lectual life and spirit which numbers alone can give.. For the 
sake of this intellectual life I should be prepared to make some 
sacrifices of other considerations, and even to incur the risk in 
small schools of keeping back one or two elder scholars, or pushing now and then a backward scholar a little farther on 
than would otherwise be desirable. The most joyless and un- 
satisfactory of all schools are those in which each child is treated 
individually, is working few or no exercises in common with 
others, and comes up to be questioned or to say a lesson alone, 
In examining a scholar on entrance, before the age of ten it is 
Entrance well to determine his position mainly by his read- Examina- ing and by his arithmetic. Above that age, es- 
tion. pecially in a school in which language forms the 
staple of the higher instruction, an elementary examination in 
Latin, in Arithmetic and in English will suffice to determine 
his position. These are the best rough tests for choosing the class in which he should be placed. If you are in doubt, it is safer and better to put him low at first rather than too high. It is always easy as well as pleasant to promote him afterwards, if 
you have at first underestimated his powers; and it is neither 
easy nor pleasant to degrade him if you begin by making a mistake in the other direction. I do not think it desirable to have separate classification for different subjects, except for special subjects such as drawing or music in which the in- dividual gifts and tastes, of children otherwise alike in age and standing, necessarily differ considerably. But for all the or. 
dinary subjects of class instruction, language, history, reading, 
writing, and lessons on science, it is well to keep the same 
scholars together. A little latitude may perhaps be allowed for 
scholars in the same class who have made different degrees of 
progress in Arithmetic, and it will not always be possible or 
desirable that all the scholars in a class should be working ex- 
actly the same sums. Yet even here we have to ask ourselves 
what we mean by progress, It does not mean hurrying on to
-P-A-G-E-68
Fees, 67 
  an advanced rule; but a fuller mastery over the applications of 
the lower. rules. I would therefore resist the very natural 
desire of the more intelligent scholars, who may have got on 
faster, and perhaps finished all the exercises in the text-book 
under a particular rule, to go on to a new rule before their fel- 
lows. It is much better to let them occupy their time either in 
recapitulation, or in doing exercises you have specially selected 
from a more difficult book, and in dealing with rather more 
complex exemplifications of the lower rules, When a new rule 
is taken the whole class should begin it at once; because as we 
shall hereafter sce the oral exposition of a new rule is an es- 
sential part of class-work; and it is one in which you cannot 
dispense with that kind of intellectual exercise which comes 
from questioning, cross-questioning, and mutual help. And if 
this be true of Arithmetic, then ceriainly it is true of every 
other subject which is usually taught in schools. 
A word or two may be properly added on the subject of fees. 
They will have a necessary tendency to increase, 
as the value of money alters, and the public esti- 
mation of good teaching rises. Already the sums mentioned on 
p. 55, which were recommended by the Schools’ Inquiry Com- 
mission in 1867, have often proved to be insufficient for the 
satisfactory conduct even of schools provided with good build- 
ings for which no interest has to be paid. Much will depend 
on the size of the schools—for the cost per head is reduced 
when numbers are large—and much also upon the character of 
the place and its surroundings, and upon the value, if any, of 
the endowment the school possesses, But whatever the fees 
prescribed, they should be inclusive of all the school charges, 
and of all the subjects taught in it. There is no harm in 
graduating fees by age, or in imposing a heavier charge on 
‘ those who come into the school late. But there should be no 
graduation by subjects—no extras, except perhaps for instru. 
mental music, or other special subject requiring quasi-private 
instruction, Nothing is more fatal to the right classification of 
a school, and to its corporate unity, than the necessity of ap- Fees.

Pealing to the parent at each stage of a pupil’s career, to know 
if this or that particular subject can be afforded or sanctioned. 
A school is not a mart, in which separate purchases may be 
made for each scholar at discretion of so much French, or 
Latin or Mathematics, but an organized community for the 
purposes of common instruction, in which no other distinction 
should be recognized among the scholars than the fitness of 
each to enter a particular class or to commence a new study. 
And of this fitness the principal teacher should be the sole 
judge. There may be in special circumstances good reasons 
for reducing the fee to the holders of scholarships or exhibi- 
tions; but the fee prescribed by regulation for those who have 
no special privilege should always be such as shall honestly 
avow to the parents the true market value of the education im- 
parted, and as shall place within the reach of every scholar who 
is admitted, without exception, the full advantage of all the in- 
struction which the school can furnish.

‘WE may fitly devote one of our meetings to the consideration 
of the physical conditions under which school The mda 
work should be carried on, and the merely mate- Conditions of

in teaching. Such considerations are of great importance. No 
effective teaching is possible when children are in a state of 
physical discomfort. We cannot afford to despise one of the 
artifices which science and experience have adopted, for mak- 
ing our scholars more at ease, and putting them into a more 
Teceptive attitude for instruction, What then are the most 
favorable external conditions under which the work of a school 
can be carried on? 
There is first the necessity for sufficient space. In the 
elementary schools it is an imperative require- 
ment that at least eight square feet of floor area 
shall be provided for every child, and this in a room ten feet 
high means a total space of 80 cubic feet. This is the mini- 
mum; and in schools provided by the rates it has of late been 
the practice to require a larger space—ten superficial feet or 100 
cubic feet, But a more liberal provision still is needed in 
good secondary schools. For you have not only to provide 
sitting-room at a desk for each scholar, but room for each class 
to stand up and means for combining two or more classes for 
collective lessons. It is obvious that the space-requirement 
must be mainly determined by the nature of the organization 
of the school, whether in separate classrooms or in one large 
room. As a general rule there is no barm in providing an 
isolated classroom for every class for which you are also able Space. 
 
-P-A-G-E-71
70 ° The School-room and its Appliances, 
  
to provide a responsible adult teacher who does not need con- 
stant supervision. And many modern schools are constructed 
on the theory that all the work is to be done in class-rooms, 
and that all the space needed is a sufficient number of such 
rooms to seat all the scholars, But there are occasions on 
which it is desirable that all the scholars should assemble to- 
gether; for morning or evening prayer, for singing, or for 
collective addresses. Without a central hall large enough to 
contain the whole of the scholars, the corporate life of a school 
cannot be properly sustained and many opportunities are lost 
of making the scholars conscious of their relations to each 
other and to the general repute and success of the school. And 
it is manifest that if such a central hall is used for these public 
purposes alone, and not for teaching, much space is wasted, 
and the estimate of area already given must be multiplied by 
two. In some modern schools the various class-rooms are 
atranged in the four sides of a quadrangle which is covered in, 
and which serves the double purpose of a central hall and of a 
common entrance to all the rooms. In this way you econo- 
mize space and dispense altogether with the necessity for a 
corridor. Moreover such an arrangement renders the assem- 
pling of all the scholars from their separate rooms, and the 
dismissal of all to their work after the roll-call or the prayers 
of the morning, a simpler and easier process, On the whole, 
experience shows that in a well-planned, lofty room two or 
three or even inore different classes may work apart without 
any disadvantage; and this arrangement is a very convenient 
one for securing due supervision over younger teachers, and. 
especially for the occasional junction of two or three classes for 
some lecture or’ special exercise which may be given collec- 
tively. Of course, if you are in circumstances which make 
you indifferent to cost, it isa good thing to have classroom 
accommodation enough for the whole school, and a central 
hall for no other than quasi- public gatherings. Even then 
some of the adjacent class-rooms sHould be so divided by mova- 
| ble partitions that two of them may be readily thrown into

Desks and their Arrangement. 71   
one when occasion requires. But when circumstances render 
it important to economize space or moncy, one large room 
which will hold the entire school for collective purposes, and 
class-rooms enough to hold half the scholars, will suffice. This 
arrangement presupposes that, for ordinary class work, one 
half of the classes will meet and receive their lessons side by 
side in the principal room, Thus, taking 100 as the unit, there 
should be one room of 45 ft. by 20, in which all can sit, but in 
which half are habitually taught; and two class-rooms, about 
15 by 17, each sufficiently large to provide accommodation for 
25 scholars. Class-rooms should be adjacent and should have 
glass doors, not necessarily for easier supervision, though that 
is important, but for increase of light. 
As to light, we have to remember that all glare should be 
avoided, and that therefore southern windows are Light. 
not the best. It is well to have one southern win- 
dow for cheerfulness, but the main light should be the steadier 
and cooler light from the north. J need hardly say that though 
sunshine may easily be in excess in a school-room, you cannot 
have too much of it ina play-ground. The best light for work- 
ing purposes is from the roof; but skylights are often hard to 
open, and in snowy weather are apt to become obscured. They 
should not therefore be the only windows, ‘You secure a better 
diffusion of light throughout a room and avoid shadows by 
having all windows high up, the lowest part being 6 or 7 ft. 
from the ground, But this is not, owing to the structure of 
rooms, always possible. When windows are low side light is 
preferable both to that from behind, which causes the pupil to 
sit in his own shadow, and to that from the front, which is apt 
to distress his eyes, And of side lights that from the left hand 
is always the best; otherwise the pupil’s writing is done at a 
disadvantage and in the shadow of his own pen. 
In planning desks, you have to consider several requirements: 
(® They should be comfortable, with a height of 
2 ft. for little children, and 2 ft. 6 in. to 8 ft. for 
older scholars; the seat in both cases being about as high from
-P-A-G-E-73
72 The School-room and its Appliances. 
  
the ground as the length of the leg from the knee to the foot. 
There should be a back rail not more than 10 inches high, and 
for very young children about 7 inches high, to give support 
just at that portion of the back where it is most needed. Most 
backs to seats and pews are too high. (2) They should be easy 
of access; for in writing-lessons, half the work of the teacher 
consists in going round the class pointing out the errors, cor- 
recting and pencilling them; and this is impossible if the desks 
are long or too crowded. At least 1 ft. 8 in. should be allowed 
for each child, In some of the American schools access is 
facilitated by giving to each scholar a separate desk and seat, the 
latter revolving on a pivot, and having its own back like a chair. 
But this is a very expensive arrangement, In the schools of 
the School Board for London, the desks are called ‘ dual.” 
Each of these measures about 8 ft. 4 in. long, and accommo- 
dates two children. They are constructed with a hinge, so that 
the front half can be lifted up when standing exercises are 
given. (8) The seats of scholars should be compactly arranged; 
so that for teaching the whole class may be brought well into 
one focus, and not spread over too wide an area for thorough 
supervision and economy of voice. ‘This requirement appears to 
conflict in some measure with the first-named conditions, Yet it 
seems so important that, for the sake of it, I should be inclined 
to sacrifice some other advantages. The desks should be so ar- 
ranged that the angle of vision for the teacher does not exceed 45°. 
It is a mistake to have more than five desks deep. If there are 
six the scholars behind are too far off for effective oversight or 
perfect hearing. (4) Desks should be very slightly sloped, nearly 
flatand about 1 foot wide; it will suffice if the seats have a width 
of 8 inches, There should be a shelf-space underneath for 
books or slates, and when each scholar has a fixed place allotted

to him, this space may be kept for all his own books and be- 
longings. But except for a very limited number of the eldest 
and most trustworthy scholars in a High school, it is not well 
to have lockers; all pigeon-holes and covered spaces which are 
appropriated to the use of individual scholars should be open. 
or easily openable; there should be no secrets or private hoards, 
and the occasional and frequent inspection of them is itself a 
useful discipline in neatness. (5) I would have you distrust al? 
contrivances by which desks like Goldsmith’s ‘‘ bed by night 
and chest of drawers by day” undertake to serve two purposes, 
e.g. to turn over and furnish a back suited for older people in 
a lecture-room, or to be fixed horizontally two together to make 
atea-table. All such devices are unsatisfactory and involve a 
sacrifice of complete fitness for school purposes. The desks 
should be so arranged that the teacher from his desk should 
command the whole group. There are two ways of effecting 
this. If his own desk is on the floor, the fourth and fifth rows 
of desks at the back should be raised by two steps, so that each 
shall be higher than that in front. If, on the other hand, all 
the scholars’ desks are on the same level floor, he himself 
should have his desk on a mounted estrade or platform. (6) 
We have to remember also that all’ the work of a scholar has 
not to be done at a desk. ‘or the due maintenance of life and 
animation in teaching, it is well, as I have already said, to give 
some of the lessons to scholars in a standing position. The 
change of attitude is a relief, and is conducive to mental activ- 
ity. Do not therefore have so large a portion of your school 
or class-room encumbered with desks as to make this arrange- 
ment impossible. Always have space enough reserved to enable 
you to draw out the class into the form of a standing semi- 
circle. : 
The questions of warmth and of ventilation should always be 
considered together. They are rather complex, yoitnation, 
owing to the very different form of buildings, the 
aspect of the rooms, and the relative position of near and sur- 
rounding objects. Teachers have few opportunities of being

          14 The School-room and its Appliances. 
  
consulted by architects about the requirements on which they 
wish to insist, but it is well to have a few principles in view, 
ready for such an opportunity when it occurs. We have to 
remember that each of us breathes about 16 times a minute or 
960 times an hour, and that every time we do this the air in any 
confined room is partly vitiated. The indispensable thing is 
that every room should have some means of admitting fresh 
and emitting foul air, There are several ways of attaining this. 
When rooms open out into a corridor, a good place for a venti- 
lator is over the door; when a group of gas-burners is in-the 
centre of the room, there should be a ventilating shaft above it 
to carry off the products of combustion. In some cases a ven- 
tilating opening in the wall of the chimney above the fireplace is 
useful. And for the admission of fresh air, a Tobin ventilating 
shaft in the corner of the room, communicating below with the 
outer air and open about 7 feet above the floor, so as to intro- 
duce a current of air where no draught will be felt by the head, 
is often an effective experiment. But all windows should be 
made to open, both at the top and bottom; and in any interval 
which occurs in the work of the class, they should be opened. 
A very slight opening both at the top and the bottom of a win- 
dow at the same time is often found to be effectual as a venti- 
lator; for you have here what the engineers call an upward and 
a downward shaft, the colder air coming in at the bottom, and 
passing upwards so as to expel the bad air at the upper open- 
ing. And if, owing to the defective supply of means for at- 
taining this purpose, you have any reason to suppose that the 
air is likely to become bad in a three hours’ sitting of the 
school, it is a good plan to break up the class for ten minutes 
when half the morning’s or afternoon’s work is over, and in 
this short interval to throw open all the windows and introduce 
a fresh supply, even in the coldest weather, of pure air. The 
little sacrifice of time will be more than compensated. 
As to warmth, we have to remember that the temperature, if 
work, especially sedentary work, is to be carried on in comfort, 
should not in any school-room be lower than 60°. But it is bad

large heated metal surfaces. On the whole, except . 
for very large schools, open fires, if judicious arrangements are 
made to surround them with proper reflecting surfaces and also 
to diffuse an equable temperature through the room and to pre- 
vent waste of fuel, are best for the purposes of heat and ven- 
tilation as well as of chcerfulness. It may be added that a gray 
color is better for the walls than either a more pronounced and 
strong color or simple white. 
Of the teaching appliances in the room, no one is more im- 
portant than the Black-board. We may not per- 
haps go so far as the enthusiastic Charbonneau, 
who says ‘Le tableau noir, c’est le vie d’enseignement,” but 
We may safely say that no school or class-room is complete 
Without one; that there is no single subject of instruction 
wherein constant recourse should not be had to it; and that it 
and all its proper appurtenances of chalk, sponge, and duster 
should always be within easy reach, that there may be no ex- 
cuse for dispensing with its aid whenever it is wanted. Per- 
haps there is no one crue by which you may detect at once so 
clearly the difference between a skilled and an unskilled teacher, 
as the frequency and tact with which he uses the black-board. 
In some American schools there is a black-board all round 
the room, 4 or 5 ft. wide; and the black surface close to the 
teacher’s desk extends nearly to the ceiling. This surface is 
more often of slate than of wood, and is sometimes of a mate- 
rial known as liquid slating. It is occasionally of a green color 
instead of black, as offering a pleasanter surface to the eye; but 
diagrams and writing are apt to be less clear when any color 
but black is adopted. :

A map of Europe, a map of Belgium, a globe, a special map

To this one might add that an easel on which maps or dia- 
grams may be displayed is useful, and that all books, slates, 
and other objects in use in the class should be kept in an easily 
accessible cupboard in the room itself, not only because all 
these things should be at hand—otherwise there is a pretext 
Sometimes for trying to do without them—but also because all

this is much disregarded in higher schools for boys, and that 
the aspect of the desks and school furniture in them is such as 
would be simply disgraceful in a school for the poor. There 
seems.no good reason for this difference. I would therefore 
never permit the school-room to be used for play, or to be open 
as a common room out of school hours when there is no super- 
vision. Remember too that every time you enlist the services 
of the scholars in some little effort to render the school-room 
and its surroundings more comely and attractive, you are doing

something to encourage the feeling of loyalty and pride in the 
school, and are doing still more to educate them into a percep- 
tion of beauty, and a desire for refined and tasteful surround- 
ings. In schools for the poor, this aim is especially important; 
but in schools for children of every rank, it must be borne in 
mind that the careful and artistic arrangement of all the school 
material, and of all pictures and illustrations, is a silent but 
very effective lesson in good taste; and will go far to make 
children love order and neatness. Whoever carries into his 
own home a feeling of discomfort and of ssthetic rebeLion 
against dirt, vulgarity, and untidiness, has learned a lesson 
which is of considerable value as a foundation for an orderly 
life. Old Joseph Lancaster’s rule, ‘A place for everything 
and everything in its place,” is of universal application, 
The registration of admission and of attendance in elemen- 
tary schools subsidized by government grants de- 
mands a special and minute care, owing to the Registration, 
fact that a portion of the grant is assessed according to the at- 
tendance; some of the payments made being dependent on the 
average attendance of scholars and some on the aggregate of 
attendances made by the particular scholars presented for ex- 
amination. Hence, for the elementary schools the strictest 
Tules are laid down (1) for the marking of every attendance, 
@) for the computation of the number of attendances registered 
for each child in every year and in every separate school term, 
(8) for the computation of averages in each class, and of the 
whole school; the total number of all the registered attendances 
being of course for this purpose divided by the number of times 
in which the school has been open. Wo erasures are ever al- 
lowed, An exact estimate is thus easily arrived at as to the 
degree in which the work of the school has been interrupted 
by irregularity of attendance, and as to the proportion of the 
actual attendance to the number of those whose names appear 
on the school registers, Nothing so elaborate is needed in the 
case of higher schools, partly because no grant of public money 
is involved, and partly because in such schools the scholars

_ attend much more regularly. But I am sure that the impor- 
tance of careful registration is insufficiently recognized. in our 
secondary and high schools; and I think that even in the best 
of them it is essential that there should be a systematic record 
for each pupil of these particulars: (1) the date of admission 
and the exact age; (2) the date of promotion to a higher class 
or of the entry on a new study; (8) absence; (4) lateness; (5) the 
result of each examination; (6) any punishment or failure of

to a minimum the chance of caprice and guess-work, and not 
to attempt to record anything unless you have carefully pre- 
served the data by which you can assure -yourself that the 
record is thoroughly accurate, Some teachers, in their zeal for 
comprehensiveness of statement, have columns for deportment, 
for politeness, and for other moral qualities which are in their 
nature very difficult to estimate, and in respect to which hap- 
hazard and therefore somewhat unjust estimates are almost 
necessarily made. For example I have seen in some foreign 
schools columus for registering “‘ moralité d’éléves,” ‘“ disposi- 
tions naturelles,” and. other impossible data. Here the rule isa 
good one: Do not pretend to measure with arithmetical exact- 
ness qualities and results which are essentially incapable of such 
measurement. 
In the French Lycées, the system of registration is often very 
elaborate. There is (1) Registre d’inscription, (2) Registre d’ap- 
pel, or attendance, (8) Registre des Compositions, and (4) Registre 
_ des bons points, in which marks are recorded for conduct, and 
for the results of every class or other examination. . The whole 
of these marks are added up and tabulated at the end of every 
month, a copy being kept by the pupil, and one sent to his 
parents or guardians. 
One of the requirements in the public elementary schools, 
which at first appeared to many of the teachers to gehool 
be.a needless addition to the routine and burden of ‘aries. 
their lives, is the keeping of what is called a Log-book or 
School Diary. It is a thick volume, such as will last for a good 
many years, and is generally fastened with a Bramah lock. 
The Code requires that entries shall be made in this book at 
least once a week, and that thus a record shall be kept of the 
Inspector’s report, of changes in the staff, of visits of managers, 
and other facts concerning the school and its teachers. It is 
not permitted to enter reflections or opinions of a general char- 
acter. Now the practice thus enforced by authority has come to 
be generally approved and liked onits own merits, and has been 
found of considerable value. Many little circumstances in the

history of a school which appear of no importance at the mo 
ment require to be recalled afterwards, and are seen to have un- 
expected value when referred to, The date of the entry of a 
new teacher on his duty, the introduction of any new school- 
book, or plan, or piece of apparatus; the starting of a hew 
series of lessons; the result of a periodical examination; special 
occurrences in relation to the discipline of the school; promo- 
tion of scholars from one class to another; any unusual circum- 
stance which affects the attendance; the visit of a stranger or a 
governor—all these are matters which are easy to jot down at 
the time of their occurrence; and which serve to make up the 
history of the school, and to give continuity and interest to its 
life. The adoption of the plan may be strongly recommended 
in schools of all grades, 
It may be well also to remember that, especially in schools of 
School book- iy size in which the number of books and the ing. quantity of school material given out is large, 
there should always be a Stock book, in which a ledger is 
kept, showing how and when books and stationery are given 
out, and to whom. The office of keeping the needful record 
is a very simple one, which may well devolve on an assistant, 
or even on an elder scholar; and it will be found that the prac- 
tice conduces to economy and order; and enables you to know exactly in what direction to look, if you have reason to suspect negligence or waste, 
I spoke in the first lecture of the importance of the habit of 
Teachers’ preparing the notes of many and indeed most of note-books. the lessons you give. To this I may now add that such notes should not be on fugitive scraps, but should al- 
ways be made in a book and carefully preserved. Unless a teacher does this habitually he squanders much time and effort, and has the weary task of preparing many of his lessons over again. Suppose you keep a brief record of the plan and order of each lesson, of the books or authorities you consulted in getting it up; suppose you add a little note after giving it, stat- ing whether it proved too long or too short, too easy or too diffi-

cult; and indicating for your own private information how it 
mighi be more effectively given next time: and lastly suppose 
you leave a blank space at the end of each, and enter in it from 
time to time, as new information comes in your way, othcr 
facts or references which will be helpful whenever you go over 
the same ground again; you will find the practice easy and 
well calculated to economize time and power. It will bring all 
your wider reading and added experience to bear on the enrich- 
ment of your professional resources; it will aid you in gather- 
ing up the fragments of life’s teaching “‘ that nothing be lost.” 
In the higher classes, and for all lessons which take the form 
of lectures, it is a good practice to let the scholars scholars’ 
have note-books, to take down at the moment any note-books. 
details which are likely to escape the memory. But such note- 
taking is of no value whatever, unless the notes are used after- 
wards as helps to the writing out of an amplified and careful 
summary of the contents of the lesson. Mere note-taking is 
often one of the most delusive and unfruitful of practices. 
Consider for a moment, what is the purpose which the taking 
of notes ought to serve. I have seen students in reading 
Froude’s history, or Mill’s Logic, sit down with the book on 
one side of them and a large note or commonplace book on the 
other into which they have laboriously made copious extracts. 
There seems to be a good deal to show for this effort; but the 
result often is that the author’s thoughts have merely been 
transferred out of one book into another; and the proportion of 
these thoughts which have actually found a lodgment in the 
student’s intelligence is very small indeed. There has been a 
mechanical process of appropriation, not a rational one.! 
The true way to make notes of a book when you read it is— 
  
1* Men seldom read again what they have committed to paper, nor 
remember what they have so committed one iota the better for their 
additional trouble. On the contrary, I believe it has a direct tendency 
to destroy the promptitude and tenuity of memory by diminishing the | 
vigor of present attention and seducing the mind to depend on future 
reference.”—SypNgY SMITH.

if itis your own—to mark in the margin the passages which 
Note-taking you feel to be of most value, and to make at 
generally. the end a little index of references, which will 
differ. from the printed index, in being specially suited to 
you, and calculated to help you in consulting the book here- 
after. But except for these purposes, I would not read 
with a pencil in hand, or copy out extracts. It is far bet- 
ter to read through au entire chapter or section, while the 
whole faculty is bent on following the reasoning or under- 
standing the facts. Then when you have closed the book, and 
while your memory is fresh, sit down, and reproduce in your 
own words as much of the contents of the chapter as you 
please. By this means you will have been forced to turn the 
subject over in your own mind, to ruminate a little, and so to 
make it your own. But unless this process of rumination goes 
on, there is no security that any of the knowledge you are. 
trying to acquire is actually assimilated. Ard the same rule 
applies to the use of note-books during lectures. Many students 
make a great effort to seize rapidly whole sentences and to set 
them down at the time; but while they are writing one down, 
another follows which gravely modifies the first, and this 
escapes them. Thus they get a few disjointed fragments, torn 
from their proper connection, and they fail to gain any true 
intellectual advantage from the whole. I am aware that the judicious use of a note-book depends a good deal on the special character of the teaching; and that a good many lecturers in the Universities and elsewhere expressly adapt their prelections 
to the case.of students who take notes. I have heard very able 
lectures which took the form of measured, brief, but very preg- 
nant sentences, in which the lecturer had been at the pains to 
concentrate as much thought as possible ; these sentences being 
slowly uttered, with a sufficient pause at the end of each, to 
allow quick writers to take down the whole verbatim. Un- 
doubtedly the note-book result in such cases seems to have 
considerable value. But it may well be doubted whether, the 
most effective teaching ever takes the form of a dictation

The Taking of Written Notes, "33 
lesson; still more may it be doubted whether when this method 
is adopted enough is done to make the students thinkers as 
well as receivers, on the subject which they learn. Whenever 
the object of the lecture is to expound pririciples, to illustrate 
them in an ample and varied way, and to show the learner 
rather the processes by which the results are arrived at than 
the formulated results and conclusions themselves, you fail to 
derive any real advantage from very copious note-taking. It 
is distracting, not helpful. You get a few detached sentences, 
perhaps, which in an unqualified way and out of their true 
perspective are no fair representation of the lecturer’s meaning: 
the continuity of his argument is broken while you are picking 
out these fragments; and you fail wholly to get the particular. 
kind of stimulus and help which the lecturer wants to give. 
If, on the other hand, you will listen attentively, seek to follow 
the reasoning, and to possess yourself not only of the aphorisms 
and conclusions, but of the processes by which they have been 
arrived at; and perhaps now and then jot down a characteristic 
phrase, a heading or some hint as to the order of the thought; 
and then, on getting home, revolve the whole matter in your 
mind, and write down in your own words an orderly summary 
of your recollections, there will be a genuine acquisition. You 
will be sure that some at least of what you have tried to learn 
has been actually assimilated. And I would counsel the adop- 
tion of the same rule in permitting your scholars ‘the practice 
of note-taking. Teach them how to use note-books. Do not 
Jet them suppose that the reproduction of your phrases is of 
any use. Do not mistake means for ends. It is a chemical 
not a mechanical combination you want. It is the writing 
out of memoranda after the lecture which serves this purpose 
and is of real intellectual value; not the notes taken during the 
lecture itself. And of these notes you have no assurance that 
they have served any good purpose unless they are ultimately 
translated out of your phraseology into the student’s own lan- 
guage.

might be said. But it would obviously be beside the main 
purpose of these lectures if I were to take upon 
Text-books. myself to recommend particular books; and so 
possibly to do injustice to the authors and publishers of many 
excellent books which I have never scen. The truth is that goodness and fitness in a school-book are not absolute but rela- 
tive terms, They depend entirely on the person who uses it. 
That book is the best for each teacher which he feels be can 
use best, and which suits best his own method and ideal of 
work. Even if the best conceivable criticism could be brought 
to bear on ail the innumerable manuals now in use, and they 
could be arranged in the order of abstract merit, such criticism 
‘might not help you much. There would still remain for each 
of you the responsibility of making your own choice. Indeed 
some of the best and most vigorous teaching I have ever heard 
has been given by teachers who were consciously using a very 
bad book, and who were goaded by it into remonstrance and 
criticism, which were in themselves very instructive and stimu- 
lating to the learner, I remember well my own teacher of 
mathematics, Professor De Morgan, and his animated polemic 
against Dilworth and Walkinghame, and especially poor Robert 
Simson’s edition of Euclid. His anger, his pitiless sarcasm, as he denounced the dulness of these writers and exposed the 
erudeness of their mathematical conceptions, were in them- 
selves well calculated to sharpen the perceptions of his students, 
The bad book in the hands of a skilful teacher proved to be better than the best book in the hands of an ordinary prac- titioner. I am not, however, prepared to recommend the use 
of bad books as a general expedient. But it cannot be too clearly understood that the right choice of a book depends en- tirely on the use you mean to make of it, 
If you are, as every teacher ought to be, fluent and skilful in oral exposition, you will need very little of the sort of explana- tion which school-books contain; your chief want will be sup. plied by books of well-graduated exercises, by which your orar teaching may be supplemented, fixed, thrust home, and brought

toa point. But if, on the other hand, you want explanations, 
rules, and a knowledge of principles, mere books of exercises 
will not suffice. You need the treatises more or less full,—say 
of grammar, of arithmetic, of geography,—and I will not 
promise that when you have got the best of them your pupils 
will be able to make progress with their help alone. The best 
explanations in school-books are concise, and therefore gene 
rally inadequate. They need expansion and much comment. 
The Educational Reading Room at South Kensington is a great 
resource. In it you will always find very easy of access all the 
newest and best school-books; which you can sit down and 
examine, and from which it is not difficult to determine what 
form of manual will suit your purpose best. 
Some of the tests by which the goodness of a school-book 
may be determined are not however difficult to lay Some tests 
down, Take a Reading-book for example. You of a good 
have here to secure: that it is well printed and at- school-book, 
tractive, that it is not silly and too childish, that the passages 
selected are not too short and scrappy, but continuous enough 
to be of some value in sustaining thought, and that every lesson 
contains a few—a very few—new words which are distinct ad- 
ditions to the reader’s vocabulary. Above all it concerns you to 
be much more anxious about the style than about the amount of 
information which is packed into the book. So also of a book 
of History or Science, I should not choose that which comprised. 
in it the greatest mass of facts, but that which was best written 
and most likely to encourage the student to desire a larger and 
fuller book. As to French, Latin and English Grammars, to 
books on Arithmetic and Geography, it concerns us much more 
to secure a good logical arrangement of rules, proper distinc- 
tion of type between important and unimportant facts, between 
typical rules and exceptional rules; with good searching and 
well-arranged exercises, than anything else. Onc good test of a 
Grammar or delectus or of a manual of any kind is this: Does 
it, as soon as it has helped the student to know something, in 
stantly set him to do something which requires him to use that 
 
-P-A-G-E-87
86 The School-room and its Appliances.° 
  
knowledge, and to show that he has really acquired it? E.g. If 
it explains 2 new term, does it require the learner soon to use 
that term? If it states a rule, docs it give him instantly occa- 
sion to put the rule in practice? If it points out a new logical 
or grammatical distinction, does it challenge him forthwith to 
find new instances and illustrations of that distinction? 
These seem to me to be the chief purposes which a book can 
serve—to supplement oral teaching, not to furnish an excuse for 
dispensing with it. I suppose the task of making compendiums, 
and trying to reduce the essence of a good many books into a 
cheap school manual, is a depressing one. At all events school- 
books must, I fear, as a rule be placed in the category—let us say 
—of uninspired writings. Their authors often evince a great 
want of imagination and a curious incapacity to discriminate 
between the significant and insignificant, between the little and 
the great, That is precisely the deficiency which a good teacher 
has to supply, and it can only be supplied by vigorous oral 
teaching. :

Schools there is great need for such adjuncts to the materials

nized. Until a good library is attached as a matter of course 
to every one of our elementary schools, a great opportunity of refining the taste and enlarging the knowledge of the young 
will continue to be wasted, and the full usefulness of those in. stitutions will remain unattained. After all, it is the main busi- ness of aprimary school, and indeed a chief part of the business of every school, to awaken a love of reading, and to give children pleasant associations with the thought of books.

without much difficulty, whenever a teacher makes up his

earnest for the means of attaining it.

select? That is a question worth thinking about. In the first 
place, you will get books of reference, good manuals, such 
as you need for amplifying a school lesson, You constantly 
have to say in teaching: ‘There is a fuller acount of this in- 
cident in such a book.” ‘‘ There are some anecdotes about this 
animal, or a poem descriptive of this place, by such a writer.” 
Or “TI should like you to read up the life of this eminent man 
before we have our next lesson.” And for purposes like these 
it is of great importance to have the best books of reference~ 
books fuller and larger than mere school-books—within reach, 
This remark applies to all schools alike. But besides this, it 
adds to the value of a child’s school-life, if something can be 
done by it to direct his reading and to teach him how to fill his 
leisure profitably. In a secondary day-school, to which pupils 
come from orderly and intelligent homes, this particular pur- 
Pose is of less importance than elsewhere, because it may be 
presumed that educated parents will look after the leisure read- 
ing of their children. It is in schools for the poor, and in all 
boarding-schools, that a general library is most needed.

instruction and improving your mind. Assume this to be true 
ofachild. Remember, if he is ever to love reading, he must 
have room left to him to exercise a little choice. Think how 
rich the world is, how much there is to be known about it, its 
structure, its products, its relation to other worlds, its people, 
the great things that have been done in it, the great speculations 
that have been indulged in it, the very varied forms in which 
happiness has been enjoyed in it. And donot forget that, be- 
yond the region of mere information about these things, there is 
the whole domain of wonderland, of fancy, of romance, of 
poetry, of dreams and fairy tales. Do not let us think scorn of 
that pleasant land, or suppose that all the fruit in the garden of 
the Lord grows on the tree of knowledge. Wonder, curiosity, 
the sense of the infinite. the love of what is vast and remote, of 
the strange and the picturesque—all these things it is true are 
not knowledge in the school sense of the word. But they are 
capable in due time of being transformed into knowledge,— 
nay, into, something better than knowledge—into wisdom and 
insight and power. 
So let us abstain from any attempt to direct a child’s general 
reading in accordance with our own special tastes. Let us re- 
member that all children have not the same intellectual appe- 
tites, and that the world would be a very uninteresting world if 
heyhad. We nced not be disappointed if even our favorite pu

pils show reluctance to read the books which we specially 
recommend, and to admire what we admire. Of Large toler- 
course, we have first to take care that all lessonsare ance should 
diligently finished, and that all due use is made of Beshown for the library for legitimate school purposes, But mental appe- 
when this is donc, and you come to consider the * 
kind of service which a library should render to a child in his 
hours of leisure, and for his own enjoyment, I think the true rule of action is first to make your library as full and varied as you can, then to exclude from it resolutely all books which you your- 
self are sorry you ever read, or would be ashamed to be seen Teading—all books which for any reason you believe to be harm- ful; and when you have done this, turn the scholar loose into the 
library and let him read what and how he likes. Have faith 
in the instincts of a child, and in the Jaw of natural selection. 
Believe that for him, as for yourself, it is true that any book which is really enjoyed, which enlarges the range of the thoughts, which fills the mind with sweet fancies or glowing Pictures, which makes the reader feel happier and richer, is worth reading, even though it serves no visible purpose as part of school education. 
The uses to which School Museums may be put are manifold, but are not all obvious at first sight. It is mani- gchoot 
fest that if Botany is taught, a collection of the museums. 
wild flowers of the district, properly pressed and classified, will 
be a useful resource, But even if this subject is not systemati- 
cally taught, such a collection, with carefully prepared speci- 
mens of the leaf, the flower, the fruit, of.the trees, ferns and 
grasses, and cereals of the district, when properly named, will 
have scarcely less interest and value. Specimens of the insects 
to be found in the district, of the stones and shells from the sea- 
shore, of the material employed in some local manufacture, and 
of its condition in its successive stages; illustrations of the 
geological formation of the district; a clay or plaster mode] 
showing the conformation of the neighboring hills and valleys, 
drawings or specimens illustrating the antiquities and historica] 
                         
-P-A-G-E-91

associations of near places, will all have their place in such a 
collection. When once a suitable receptacle has been provided. 
for such things, and arrangements have been made, by the ap- 
pointment of curators or otherwise, for keeping it in seemly 
condition, it is surprising to observe what pride the scholars 
often feel in it, how it serves to keep their eyes open to find 
new and suitable objects, and how glad they are to contribute 
toit. A museum of this kind cannot be purchased or set up 
all at once; it must grow, and be the product of willing work- 
ers and observers. Its purpose need not be wholly scientific or 
even instructive. It may with advantage be made the depos- 
itory for any little work of invention or art which the scholars 
can themselves produce. One may contribute a drawing, 
another a piece of needlework unusually well finished, another 
an effort at design, a model of a neighboring church or castle, 
or a set of illustrations of some form of manufacture in which 
his father is engaged. Every scholar may be encouraged to 
leave behind him before quitting school some little memorial 
of himself, his doings, or his special tastes. A mere general 
museum of odds and ends which anybody chooses to present to 
the school, and with which the scholars have no associations, is 
of little worth. However small your collection, it should be 
characteristic of the school and of its special studies, its history 
and its surroundings. And if it fulfils this condition, it will 
not only be found a useful adjunct to your scientific teaching, 
but also a means of encouraging the development of any special 
gift the scholars may possess, and of increasing their loyalty to 
the school. . 
We shall, in connection with each of the subjects of instruc- 
Costiy ins. tion hereafter discussed, refer to the particular 
always the form of apparatus or material aid which lends it- 
best. self best to the furtherance of the teacher's objects. 
But one general observation may be made here. New and 
ingenious forms of mechanical aid for teaching are being de- vised every day, and publishers and instrument-makers are in- 
terested in multiplying them. It may occur to some of us that

the material equipments of a good school are thus becoming 
more complex, and threatening to be very costly. It may 
partly console us to remember that the elaborate illustrations 
which cost most money are not necessarily the most effective, 
A good cosy set by a writing-master is often more useful than 
an engraved copy. A rough black board drawing of the par- 
ticular river or county which you are describing impresses and 
interests scholars more than a painted map. A rude model in 
sand or clay, made up in sight of the scholars, will illustrate 
the set of a glacier or the formation of a lake better than any 
purchased model. To count the panes of glass in a window, or 
the pictures on the wall, is not less instructive, and much more 
interesting, than to count the balls on an abacus or frame. In 
short, illustrations made pro hde vice, and visibly contrived by 
the teacher’s own ingenuity for the elucidation of the particular 
truth he wants to teach, are often found to serve their purpose 
much more effectually than the manufactured illustrations 
which you buy at shops. 
It is, after all, but a few detached suggestions as to the mate- 
rial surroundings of a teacher, and as to school equipment gen- 
erally, that we have thus been able to offer you. But the gen- 
eral impression which it has been sought to convey is that no 
amount of care and inventiveness and forethought which you 
are able to devote to these little things will be wasted, and that 
whatever tends to make the school-room brighter, healthier, 
comelier, more orderly, tends to economize time and temper, 
and to diminish the friction inseparable from a laborious school 
life. Above all, you cannot, by putting yourself into the hands 
of publishers, instrument-makers, or even of lecturers on teach- 
ing, escape from the responsibility of looking at each of these 
problems with fresh eyes; and of determining how far the 
helps and contrivances which other people have used are avail.

  IV. DISCIPLINE. 
I wave thought it right to dedicate one of these lectures to

San aamin- a ruler and administrator than as an instructor. . 
ruler. For it need not be said that he who can teach but 
cannot govern works at an enormous disadvantage. Perfect 
discipline in a class or a school is an indispensable condition of 
successful teaching. It is necessary for the pupils, not only 
because by it they will learn in a given time twice as much and 
twice as easily; but because one of the things they come to 
school to acquire over and above certain arts and accomplish- 
ments which are generally termed education, is the practice of 
obedience. The habit of subjugating one’s own impulses, of 
constantly recognizing the supremacy of law, and bringing our 
actions into harmony with it, is one of the first conditions of an 
orderly and well-disciplined life. He who does not at least 
acquire that at school has been under instruction to little pur- 
pose, whatever progress he may have made in technical learn- 
ing. And it is of no less consequence to the teacher. His own 
health, his temper, and his happiness suffer grievously if he 
cannot command perfect obedience. One may secure it by 
Personal influence and another by force, and it will be easy for 
us to see which is the better method of the two. But by some 
means or other it must be had: it is better to gain it by force 
than notat all. For without it the school isa place of torment to 
all concerned, and must always remain inefticient for every 
purpose which it professes to serve. 
" It may clear the ground a little if I say how obedience is not to be gained. You cannot get it by demanding or claiming ity

by declaring that you will have it; or even by explaining to your 
scholars how useful and indispensable itis. Obedi- Obedience

orderly, not by talking about order. There are some things on 
which it is well to draw out the intelligence and sympathies of 
a child, and to make him understand the full reason and motive 
of what you do. But on this point I would not, except on 
rare and special occasions, enter into any discussions, or offer 
any explanations, Al entreaty—‘‘ Now do give me your atten- 
tion;”—all self-assertion —‘ I wild have order;”’—all threats—“‘ If 
you don’t attend tu me, I will punish you;” are in themselves 
signs of weakness. They beget and propagate disobedience; 
they never really correct it. All noise and shouting aggravate 
the evil, and utterly fail to produce more than a temporary lull 
at best, 
‘* He who in quest of silence ‘ silence’ hoots, 
Is apt to make the hubbub he imputes.” 
All talk about discipline in a school is in fact mischievous. To 
say “I ought to be obeyed” is to assume that a child’s know- 
ledge is to be the measure of his obedience, to invite him to 
discuss the grounds of your authority, ‘perhaps to dispute it. 
A nation, we know, is in an abnormal state while its members 
are debating the rights of man or the fundamental principles of 
government. There should be underlying all movement and 
political activity, a settled respect for law and a feeling that law 
once made must be obeyed. So no family life of a right kind 
is possible, if the members ever treat the authority of the parent, 
as an open question. The duty of obeying is not so much a 
thing to be learned per se. It must be learned before the learn- 
ing of anything else becomes possible. It is like food or air in 
Telation to our bodily lives; not a thing to be sought for and 
Possessed for itself, but an antecedent condition, without which 
all other possessions become impossible. So it is not well in 
laying down a school rule to say anything about the penalty
-P-A-G-E-95
94 , Discipline. 
  
which will fall upon those who transgress it. Show that you 
do not expect transgression; and then, if it comes, treat it—as 
far as you can with perfect candor and honesty do so—as some- 
thing which surprises and disappoints you; and for which you 
must apply some remedy) rather for the scholar’s sake than your 
own. 
Now the first way to secure obedience to commands is to 
Commands make every rule and regulation you lay down the 
tobe well, —_ subject of careful previous thought. Determine 
before they on the best course and be sure you are right, 
are given. Then you will gain confidence in yourself, and 
‘without such confidence authority is impossible. Be sure that 
if you have any secret misgiving as to the wisdom of the order 
you give or as to your own power ultimately to enforce it, that 
misgiving will reveal itself in some subtle way, and your order 
will not be obeyed. An unpremeditated or an indefinite com- 
mand—one the full significance of which you yourself have not 
understood—often proves to be a mistake, and has to be retract- 
ed. And every time you retract an order your authority is 
weakened. Never give acommand unless you are sure you can 
enforce it, nor unless you mean to sce that it is obeyed. You 
must not shrink from any trouble which may be necessary to 
carry out a regulation you have once laid down, It may in- 
volve more trouble than you were prepared for; but that 
trouble you are bound to take, in your scholar’s interest and in 
‘your own. We must not evade the consequences of our own 
orders, even when we did not foresee or even desire all of them. 
The law once laid down should be regarded as a sacred thing, 
binding the lawgiver as much as the subject. Every breach of 
it on the scholar’s part, and all wavering or evasion in the en- 
forcement of it on your own, puts a premium on future dis- 
obedience and goes far to weaken in the whole of your pupils 
a sense of the sacredness of law. 
And when rules and orders descend to details, your super- 
vision should be so perfect that you will certainly know whe- 
“ther in all these details the orders have been obeyed or not.
-P-A-G-E-96
Over-governing. 95 
  
Unless you can make arrangements for detecting a breach of 
Jaw with certainty, do not lay down a law at all. It may be 
replied to this, that an attitude of habitual suspicion is not favor- 
able to the cultivation of self-respect in a scholar, and that you 
want often to trust him and show you rely on hishonor. True. 
The development of the conscience and of the sentiment of 
honor is one of your highest duties; but in cases where you can 
safely appeal to the sense of honor, it is not a command which 
is wanted, but a wish, a principle, a request, You explain that 
certain course of action is right or desirable or honorable in 
itself; and you say to your scholar, ‘Now I think you see 
what I mean; I shall trust “you to doit.” That is, you part in 
Some degree with your own prerogative as a governor, and in- 
vite him to take a share in his self-government. But you do 
not put your wishes into the form of a command in this case, 
Commands are for those in whom the capacity for self-com- 
mand is imperfectly developed; and in their case vigilance 
does not imply suspicion: it is for them absolutely needful to 
know that when you say a thing has to be done, you mean for certain to know whether it is done or not. Involuntary and 
mechanical obedience has to be learned first; the habit of con- 
scious, voluntary rational obedience will come by slow de- 
grees. : And let us not forget that admirable rule so often quoted 
from Jean Paul Richter, ‘Pas trop gouverner;” Over'govern- 
we should not over-govern, we should never multi- ment to. be 
ply commands, nor needlessly repeat one. Our avoided. 
governing force should be regarded by us as a bank reserve, on 
which we should be afraid to draw too often, because it may 
become exhausted. Every good ruler economizes power, and 
never puts it all forth at once. Children should feel, when 
they see us exercising authority, that there is a great reserve of 
- unused strength and resolution behind, which they can neither 
see nor measure. It is not the visible exercise of power which 
impresses ,children most, but the unseen, which affects their 
{magination, and to which they can assign io limit. And thig
-P-A-G-E-97

is most fully felt when the manner of putting forth strength is 
habitually calm and quiet, when you abstain from giving com- 
mands in regard to things which are indifferent, and when 
such commands as you give are few and short. ‘ Evenagrown 
man,” says Richter, ‘whom some one should follow all day 
long with movable pulpit and stool of confession, from which 
to hurl sermons and anathemas, could never attain any real 
activity and moral freedom. How much less then a weak 
child, who at every step in life must be entangled with a ‘stop,’ 
‘run,’ ‘be quiet,’ ‘do this, do that’? Your watch stops while 
you wind it up, and you everlastingly wind up children and 
never let them go.” We have not to think of a scholar merely 
as material put into our hands to mould and manipulate, but 
rather as a responsible human being, whom we are so to help, 
that as soon as possible he may regulate his own life, and be a 
law unto“himself. Keep clearly in view your own responsi- 
bilities, but the less display you make of your disciplinary ap- 
paratus, and the more freedom you can leave to the pupil, the 
better. Reduce as far as possible the number of formal rules; 
and remember that the perfection of government is to effect the 
maximum result with the minimum of visible machinery. 
And yet you will gain much in a school by cultivating the

down at a desk, of moving from one place to another, of hand- 
ling and opening books, of cleaning slates, of giving out pens 
and paper, of entering and leaving school. Petty as each of 
these acts is separately, they are important collectively, and the 
best teachers habitually reduce all these movements to drill, 
and require them to be done simultancously, and with finished 
and mechanical exactness, Much of this drill is conducted in some good schools by signs only, not merely because it is easy 80 to economize noise and voice-power, but also because it makes the habit of mechanical obedience easier. And children once accustomed to such a régime always like it—nay, even de

light in it. I have seen many schools, both small and large, in 
which all the little movements from class to class were con- 
ducted with military precision; in which even so little a thing 
as the passing of books from hand to hand, the gathering up of 
pens, or the taking of places at the dinner-table, of hats or 
bonnets from their numbered places in the hall, was done with 
a rhythmical beauty, sometimes to musical accompaniment, 
which not only added to the picturesqueness of the school life, 
and to the enjoyment of the scholars, but also contributed much 
to their moral training and to their sense of the beauty of obedi- 
ence. And I have no doubt that it is a wise thing for a teacher 
to devise a short code of rules for the exact and simultaneous 
performance of all the minor acts and movements of school 
life, and to drill his scholars into habitual attention to them. 
Does it seem to some of you that there is a little inconsistency 
between the last two counsels I have ventured to Limits to its

power by a needless multiplication of rules; the other, that you 
should turn the little ones into machines, even in regard to 
such matters as sitting and standing at a desk, or opening a, 
book? There is indeed, if you will look at it, no inconsistency . 
between these two views of your duty. There is a sphere of 
our life in which it is desirable to cultivate independence and 
freedom; and there is another in which it is essential that we 
should learn to part with that independence for the sake of 
attaining some end which is desirable for others as well as for 
ourselves, In the development of individual character and in- 
telligence, the more room we can leave for spontaneous action 
the better; but when we are members of a community, the 
healthy ‘corporate life of that community requires of us an 
abnegation of self. The soldier in an army must gud that 
army forego his personal volition, and become part of a great 
machine, which is working towards some greater end than 
could possibly be achieved if he retained complete autonomy,

council or municipality, or public company, to work with

  others towards ends which require unity of action, and which 
are incompatible with the assertion of our individual rights. 
It is then for this class of duties that school should in some 
measure prepare every child. He is in an artificial community 
which has a life and needs of its own, and in so far as he con- 
tributes to make up this school life, he may be well content to 
suppress himself and to become a machine. There are times in 
life for asserting our individuality, and there are times for 
effacing it. And a good school should provide means whereby 
it may be seen when and how we may do both. 
This sense of corporate life and responsibility so essential to

to be proud of; some function or ritual in which he shall be 
specially interested, and in which he can sustain an honorable 
part. I do not like a needless multiplication of unmeaning 
offices in a school, but every little function, such as that of 
curator of the books, or the copies, or the apparatus of a class, 
is in its way useful, if it makes the elder scholar feel that he 
can be helpful to the younger, or that he can contribute some- 
thing to the beauty or to the repute of the school as a whole. 
It is here as with the games in which the victory is not for an 
individual, but for the side, the company or the school to which 
the player belongs; the very act of putting forth effort on be- 
half of the community tends powerfully, to check selfishness 
and egoism, and to make the scholar conscious that the com- 
munity has interests into which, for a time, it is both a duty - and a privilege for him completely to merge his own,

both to them and to yourself. The fact is that a child is sent 
to school to obtain a kind of discipline which is impossible in a 
family, and to learn many things which he could not learn at 
home, The moral basis of family life is affection. The morab 
basis of school life, as of that of all large communities, is jus- 
tice. It is not difficult in a well-ordered home to learn courtesy, 
kindness, the sanctity and the happiness of self-sacrifice, be- 
cause those virtues have to be exercised towards those whom 
we know and love. But in a school we are called on to respect 
the rights and consult the feelings of people whom we donot 
love, and whom we scarcely know. And this is a great part 
of education. It can only be attained when the corporate spirit 
is rightly called forth, when the equal claims of others are fully 
recognized, and when opportunities are offered for losing the 
sense of personal claims in those of comradeship, and for 
evincing pride in the perfection and prosperity of the school as 
an institution, 
And in governing, it is of the last importance that we should 
well consider the nature of the being whom we , . + : id nature 
want to control, and not demand of him an im- to be studied 
possible standard of virtue. A little child has not pera, 
your seriousness, nor your sense of duty, nor your 
capacity for sitting ‘still. He would be a very curious, almost 
an unpleasant phenomenon if he had. On the contrary, nature 
makes him physically restless, very curious, mobile, and in- 
quisitive, and exceedingly deficient in reverence. And these 
qualities should be taken for granted and allowed for, not set 
down as faults, Provision should be made for giving lawful 
yent to his personal activity, and if such provision be not 
made, and he is called on to maintain a confined posture for 
an unreasonable time, bis restlessness and disobedience are the 
teacher’s fault, not his. Let us take for granted that in every
-P-A-G-E-101
100 . Discipline. 
  
fault of a child there is an element of good, “would men ob- 
servingly distil it out,” that every act of mischief he is guilty 
of is only an example of perfectly healthy and legitimate ac- 
tivity, accidentally misdirected. And above all let us take care 
not to measure his fault by the inconvenience which it causes 
us, but rather by considering the motive and the causes of it. 
Some of the little wrong acts of a child which bring the most 
annoyance to a teacher and try his temper most are precisely 
those which from the point of view of a moralist are least 
blameworthy—talking at unreasonable times, destructiveness, 
untidiness, noise. These things have to be checked of course. 
But do not let us confuse the conscience of a child by exag- 
gerating their seriousness, or by treating offences against school 
rules as if they were breaches of the moral order of the uni- 
verse. Consider what are the natural instincts of a child, and 
how unformed his moral standard is, and you will see that 
relatively to him offences of this kind are not crimes, though 
relatively to you and to the school they may be serious annoy- 
ances, . 
After all the great safeguard for good and happy discipline 
Fillthe time im a school is to fill the time with work. If a 
with work, child is to have an interval of leisure, let it be in the pfay-room or ground, where relaxation is permissible, and 
even noise is not a sin, But let him have no intervals of lei- 
sure in school, There, and in school time, where play is not 
permitted, let work be systematically prescribed. You will 
of course take care that the work is duly varied, that it does 
not put too great a strain on one set of muscles, or on one 
set of faculties; you will sec that light mechanical work 
alternates duly with serious intellectual application. But 
work of some kind—work which is duly superintended, and 
which cannot be evaded, should be provided for every 
minute of the school day. ‘Let every child have,” said 
Joseph Lancaster, ‘‘ at all times, something to do and a mo- 
tive for doing it.” 
No doubi this business of maintaining discipline comes

more easily to some than others. There are some who 
seem qualified and designed by nature to exer- ‘he faculty 
cise ascendency over others. They are born like of command; 
Hamlet's father with quired. 
“ An eye like Mars, to threaten and command,” 
or better still they are naturally endowed with that sweet gra- 
ciousness and attractiveness of manner which at once win con- 
fidence, and predispose the hearers to listen and obey. Of such 
a teacher her pupil may often say as Richard Steele once said 
in the finest compliment ever paid to a lady, ‘‘ That to love her 
is a liberal education.” And yet those of us who are not thus 
equipped by nature have no right to be discouraged. Every 
one may acquire the power of ruling others by steadily setting 
himself to do so, by thinking well over his orders before he 
gives them, by giving them without faltering or equivocation, 
by obeying them himself, by determining in every case, and 
at whatever cost, to sce them obeyed, and above all by 
taking care that they are reasonable and right, and properly 
adapted to the nature of childhood, to its weaknesses and its 
needs, . 
Since obedience and fixed attention are habits, they are sub- 
ject to the same law which is found to regulate all The law of 
other habits. And this law is very curious and habit. 
worth attention. In virtue of it we find that any one act 
which we perform to-day is easier to perform to-morrow, and 
easier still next day, and afterwards becomes so mechanical by 
frequent repetition that in due time it is difficult for us not to 
do it. We may observe this in ourselves, in all the little manual 
acts which we perform every day: they become exactly like one 
another even without any conscious desire on our part that they 
should belike. Our handwriting for instance becomes so fixed, 
that it is positively difficult for us to disguise it. And on the 
other hand all acts which we leave undone become daily more 
difficult; the habit of not doing becomes as confirmed as that of 
doing. Bishop Butler has analyzed this law of habit at much

length, and with great subtlety, and he proves that all our 
habits whether mental, bodily or moral are strengthened by re 
peated acts. The practice of speaking the truth, of temperance, 
of charity, or of prompt obedience, becomes strengthened every 
time it is put into action. The question is as old as Aristotle, 
Does character produce actions, or do actions produce charac- 
ter? Is for example a man a temperate man because he ab- 
stains from excessive indulgence; or does he so abstain because 
he is a temperate and virtuous man? Now no doubt cither of 
these questions might in a sense be answered in the affirmative; 
because habit and character act and react on each other. But 
in the long-run it is far truer to say that habits make character, 
than'to say character makes habits. Character has been not 
improperly called a bundle of habits. We are what we are not 
so much because of what we wish to be, nor of any sentiments 
we have formed, but simply by virtue of what we are doing 
every day. And if, as is probably true of all of us, we are con- 
stantly saddened by noticing how far we fall short of our own 
ideal, there is but one remedy; it is to place ourselves in new 
nditjons, to brace ourselves up to some new effort, and to 
ynew set of habits, Mere meditation on what we wish 
Nie resolutions, clear perception of the difference 
mn right and wrong, are of little use unless they show 
themselves, in acts. Nay, they are worse than useless. Hear 
Butlér: “ Going over the theory of virtue in one’s mind, talk- 
ing wel. and drawing fine pictures of it: this is so far from 
necessarily or certainly conducing to form a habit of it in him 
who thus employs himself that it may harden the mind in a 
contrary course. . . . For, from our very faculty of habit, pas- 
sive impressions by being, repeated grow weaker. Thoughts 
by often passing through the mind are felt less sensibly. 
Being accustomed to danger begets intrepidity, i.e. lessens 
fear, and to distrtss lessens the emotion of pity. And from 
these two observations together, that practical habits are formed 
and strengthencd by repeated acts and that passive impressions 
grow weaker by being repeated, it may follow that motives

and excitements (to right action) are continually less and less 
consciously felt, even as the active habits strengthen.”

nothing of its bearing on your own personal character, on your 
‘capacity for work, on the steadiness and the method of your 
reading; but think for a moment what it means in relation to 
the pupils who come to you for instruction. It means that 
every time they come into your presence the habit of obedient 
attention is being either confirmed or weakened. It means 
that every unregarded counsel or order of yours falls more in- 
effectually on the ear than the last. It means that prompt and 
exact obedience if insisted on in little things becomes available 
for great things; it means in short that on the daily régime of 
your school depends the whole difference for life, in the case of 
your pupils, between a wandering loose slipshod style of think- 
ing and of reading, and an orderly and observant mind, one 
accustomed to put forth all its best powers and to bring them 
to bear on any object worthy of pursuit. And what a profound - 
difference this is! It is only when we try to realize it and to 
see it in relation to our own life, and to the lives of the people 
who are struggling and failing around us, that the true signifi- 
cance of early drill and discipline becomes apparent'te us. : 
The sports and recreations of childhood come faitly within 
the province of a schoolmaster and deserve his - 
careful thought. But it would be easy to err on 
the side of over-regulation and too minute direction on this 
point. It is of the essence of healthy and really useful play 
that it should be spontancous. What children are learning— 
and they are learning much—in play, ought to be learned un- 
consciously, and without any suspicion that they are being 
drilled and disciplined. Their own fresh instincts are here the 
safest guides to you, when you want to supply them with rec- 
reation. The toys which they like best are not merely objects 
to look at, such as would gratify the taste of older persons, |

The capacity for admiration is soon exhausted in children. 
They like best something to handle, to arrange, to derange, and 
to re-arrange; a doll which can be dressed and undressed, a 
house of bricks which can be built up and pulled down; a.tool 
which can be actually used; a machine model or a puzzle which 
will take to pieces. It is not the beauty or the costliness of a 
toy which gives permanent pleasure to a child, but the posses- 
sion of some object, however rude, which calls into exercise his 
faculties of invention, of tactual and physical activity, and even 
of destructiveness. For destructiveness is not wholly a vice. 
It is in its way a symptom of curiosity and of inquisitiveness, 
of desire to know what a thing is made of, and how it is made. 
And this after all is the true philosophic instinct; without it we 
should have no great inventors, and make little or no advance 
in science. We must not repress this instinct because some of 
its manifestations are apt to be inconvenient to us, It is our 
business to take the instinct for granted, to recognize its useful- 
ness and to provide due scope for its exercise. This is now 
often done in great public schools, by attaching to them work- 
shops, in which boys who have a mechanical turn are allowed 
to learn the use of tools and a turning-lathe, to make the ap- 
paratus used in the lessons on science as well as boxes and other 
useful articles for themselves. 
Regular gymnastic and calisthenic exercises, graduated and 
Gymnastics. arranged on a system, have their value, though 
they are for several reasons less in favor in Eng- 
lish than in French and German schools. A covered gymna- 
sium, with cross-bars, ropes and poles for leaping and climb- 
ing, is a useful appendage to every school. But it is not well 
to rely too much on this artificial help. Most good English 
teachers prefer to let nature have freer play, and suggest her 
own form of gymnastics. The movements of a healthy child 
in running, in leaping, in rowing, in swimming, in throwing a 
ball, in achieving some object which he cares to attain, are 
. quite as valuable as the regulated preconcerted set of move- 
ments of a professor of gymnastics, and much more interesting.

Taking a constitutional walk, for walking and for exercise 
sake, is, as we all know, less enjoyable, and even less invigorat- 
ing, than walking to some place we want to goto. Soa child 
likes better to achieve some result, to overcome some difficulty, | 
than to go through a set of exercises which are of no value ex- 
cept as exercises, and which lead to nothing in which he is in- 
terested. 
The need of free animal pastime is already so fully recog- 
nized in Boys’ schools, that there is some danger Over esti- 
of overestimating ils importance as an element in Mate of ath. | 
school life. Considering that it is, at any rate, the for boys. 
first business of a school to encourage learning, and develop 
mental power, it is rather a discredit to some of our great 
schools that so large a proportion of time and thought should 
be devoted to athletics; and that success in cricket and football 
and rowing should so often be valued as much as intellectual 
distinction. We are in danger of presenting boys with a false 
ideal of manliness, when we lead them to suppose that they 
come to school merely to become healthy and robust. Let us | 
by ali means place scholars in conditions favorable to the high- 
est physical activity and development, but do not let us so mis- 
take the true proportions of things as to exalt mere healthy 
animalism into a’ school accomplishment or a moral virtue. 
The publicity and show often attendant on the exhibition of I 
athletic sports in a school may easily be carried to a mis- 
chievous extent. It need not be said that we are in no such 
danger in schools for girls. There, the great fault syo00 of them 
is the frigid propriety, the languor and inaction, needed for 
which too often fill up the leisure time. Girts &"* 
need the free exercise of their limbs as much as their brothers, 
but they are not nearly so conscious of this need; and exercises | 
must therefore be devised: for them. Tennis, fives, and even

purpose well; something more is wanted than mere dawdling ‘

any sense. . 
One of the hardest of the disciplinal problems of a boarding- 
Sunday ina school is the regulation of the*employments for 
boarding- Sunday. You want that the day shall have aspecial 
character, that its religious associations shall be re- 
spected, and above all that it shall be felt by all the scholars to 
be a day of rest, refreshment and enjoyment. It must not be 
passed in mere idleness, so one or two lessons of an appropriate 
kind must be devised; but with these there should be required. 
as little as may be of irksome effort. The religious services 
‘should be short, varied, and interesting, and if possible such as 
to enlist the aid of the scholars in the choir. And for the rest, 
leave as much liberty as you can, both as to the reading and 
the occupations of the day. Let the claims of the higher life 
be recognized, and do what you can, rather by opportunity and 
by the general calm and order of the day’s arrangements, to 
show that you regard those claims as paramount, But do not 
map out your Sunday scheme on the assumption that a day full 
of devotion or of religious reading or exercises can be delightful 
to a boy, or is appropriate to so early a stage in his moral and 
spiritual progress. Any attempts to enforce upon him the be- 
havior and the tastes of older and serious people are apt to de- 
feat their own purpose. They produce a sense not only of 
unreality but of weariness and disgust in those who rebel; or 
worse still, they sometimes generate insincerity and religious 
conceit in those who submit, Whatever else is done, let Sun- 
day exercises be such as can be reasonably enforced and hon- 
estly enjoyed. 
' We have to consider tow the influence of rewards and 
Rewards. punishments on the discipline of a school, and 
: . on the formation of individual character. Now 
a child may be stimulated to exertion by ‘very different mo- 
‘tives: 
(1) By the desire to get something: or by the hope of some 
tangible reward.
-P-A-G-E-108
Prizes. 107 
  
(2) By the desire of distinction and the wish to excel his fel 
lows. 
(8) By the desire to win approbation from parents or teachers. 
(4) By the simple wish to improve, and to do the right thing 
because it is right. 
Now here is a whole gamut, of motive, an‘ I have put first 
that which is clearly the lowest, and have arranged them ac- 
cording to their degrees of worthiness. You may feel that so 
long as you.can get right conduct and intellectual exertion you 
will be well content, whichever of these motives prevails, But 
at'the same time you are conscious that it is a much nobler 
tesult of your discipline to get them from the last motive than 
from any one of the others. For the first has an element in it 
of selfishness and covetousness, the second is nearly akin to 
vanity, and even the third is not perfectly pure. And one rule 
of action will be anticipated at once by all who follow me in 
this classification of motive forces. Never appeal to the lower 
form of inducement if you can make the higher suffice. But 
it is notorious that we do appeal very much in England to the 
hope of reward. Our whole educational plans both for boys 
and for men are pervaded through and through jvith the prize 
system. We have rewards, exhibitions, money prizes, scholar- 
ships, fellowships—an elaborate system of bribery, by which 
we try to stimulate ambition and to foster excellence. A recent 
traveller in England, Dr. Wiese, the late director of pubtic in- 
struction in Prussia, a man of keen insight, and strongly pre- 
disposed to admire British institutions, expresses great surprise 
at this, “Of all the contrasts which the English mode of 
thinking and acting shows, none has appeared to me so strik- 
ing and contradictory as the fact that a nation which has so 
great and sacred a sense of duty makes no use of that idea in 
the school education of the young. It has rather allowed it to 
become the custom, and it is an evil custom, to regard the pros- 
pect of reward and honor as the chief impulse to industry and 
exertion,” This is to be found, he goes on to say, at all stages 
of instruction from the University to the Elementary School.        
-P-A-G-E-109
  108 Discipline. 
  
Prizes and medals are given not only for progress in learning 
out also for good conduct. ‘If any one in England wishes te 
benefit an institution, the first thing always is to found prizes 
and scholarships, which in this way have cuormously increased 
in some schools.” And he then expresses his amazement not 
only at the large proportion of scholars who at a breaking-up 
day are found to have been cowronnés or rewarded in some way, 
but at the heap of gift-books which often falls to the lot of a 
single scholar. Now Dr. Wiese has here hit an undoubtedly 
weak point in our English education. We use rewards some- 
what lavishly. We rely on them too much, as furnishing the 
motive to excellence, and we thus do not give a fair chance to 
the development of purer and nobler motives. There are 
many reasons for this. I have scen schools in which prizes 
‘were numerous and costly, out of all proportion to the merits 
of the scholars, and have been told that the parents expected 
it, that they would be offended if the children brought nothing 
home at Christmas, and that therefore it was necessary under 
some pretext or other that nearly every child should have a 
prize. Then rich people of kindly instincts who take an in- 
terest in a school often know no other way of gratifying those 
instincts than by establishing a prize. The immediate result is 
so pleasant, the gratification of the receiver of the prize isso 
evident, that it is very hard for the generous giver to believe that 
he has done any harm, But harm is done nevertheless. It is 
Prizes shoulg Bere as with charity to the poor, about which so 
be carefull much has been said of late. We have no right to 
* gratify our kindly sensibilities at the expense of 
the manliness and strength of those whom we wish to benefit. 
What we see in both cases is pleasure, gratitude, very agreeable 
things to recognize; but what we do not see is some enervation 
of the character, the silent encouragement of a false and lowered 
estimate of duty. Hence I venture to offer this general coun- 
sel. Use rewards sparingly. Do not rely on their influence 
too much. Do not give them for ordinary obedience, or fair 
average application; but let them be felt as real distinctions;
-P-A-G-E-110
Happiness of Children. 109 
  
reserve them for cases of special effort or excellence; and do not 
feel bound to accept every gift or endowment by which an amia- 
ble friend of the school may propose to enrich it, unless you see 
that there is likely to be genuine merit to correspond. to the gift. 
And in like manner I would urge upon you to economize 
your praise. People of kindly natures who are sndcommen- 
much in contact with children are apt to be pro- ‘ationalso. 
fuse in little expressions of satisfaction, ‘ Very well done,” and 
the like, And if such phrases are habitually used, one of two 
things will happen: either they will be taken at their real 
worth—as amiable but rather feeble utterances, and not true 
criticisms—in which case the teacher’s influence will be dimin- 
ished, and he will have no means left for giving praise when 
the special occasion for it arises; or they will be really valued. 
by the scholars who will learn to expect it and to rely on it, 
and so will lose something of their moral strength, It is not 
good to get a habit of relying on constant encouragement, It 
is a great part of the discipline of a schoo] to train a child into 
doing what is right without commendation. Do not therefore 
let a false amiability cause you to waste your praise. ‘‘ Even 
distinguished merit,” says Mr. Bain, “should not always be 
attended with peans.” And the merit you are most concerned 
to encourage is not cleverness, nor that which comes of special 
natural gifts, but rather the merit of conscientious industry and 
effort, 
By all means let us respect the happiness of children. Cheer- 
fulness—joyousness—the atmosphere of love and Happiness of 
of well-ordered liberty—these things make the n. 
heaven in which a little child lives, and in which all that is 
gracious and beautiful in his character thrives the best. Let 
him have as much of this as you can. But do not confound it 
with enjoyments, with what are called pleasures, with enter- 
tainments, with spectacles, with prizes, with things that cost 
money.! These are not what a child wants, Let us keep them

in reserve till the evil days come when the zest of life needs to 
be sustained by these poor devices. ‘‘ Life would be very tol- 
erable,” said Sir George Lewis, ‘‘ were it not for its pleasures.” 
A schoolmaster cannot accept for himself or his scholars quite 
80 cynical a theory as this, but he will none the lesg admit that 
it is a poor thing even in childhood to be dependent for a sub- 
stantial part of our happiness on treats, on menus plaisirs and 
exceptional gratifications, In the long-run we should find our 
chief delight in the ordinary pursuits and duties of life rather 
than in occasional release from them, And if school is to pro- 
vide in this respect g training for after-life, it should establish 
in the young scholar’s mind happy associations with the duties 
and employments of every day, and not exclusively or even 
mainly with fétes and holidays. 
The saddest part of a schoolmaster's experience tes in pe 
necessity for punishments, It is impossible but 
Punishments, that offences will come. But if we are to deal 
tightly with them when they come, we must first understand 
in what light we ought to look on all sin and wrong-doing, 
especially that of a child. And it is surely essential to learn to 
treat it without harshness, yet without levity or indifference; 
with full recognition of the sanctity of the law which has been 
broken, and yet with sympathy for the weakness which led to 
the breach of it. If we begin by viewing faults in this light, 
we shall be better prepared to look this difficult question in the 
face. 
Now Ican conceive threé possible purposes which punish- 
Different ment may serve, It may (1) be purely retributive purposes of or vindictive, and intended to’ show the necessary 
P : "and righteous connection between wrong-doing 
and suffering; or (2) be purely exemplary, designed to warn others and to prevent the repetition of the fault; or (3) be de- signed for the reformation of the offender. If you consider the punishments inflicted by the State for the violation of its laws, you will see that they are to be defend ‘ led mainly, almost exclu- sively, on the second of these grounds. It is not simply for the
-P-A-G-E-112
Purpose of” Punishment. 1 
  
vindication of the eternal principles of right and wrong, or for 
avenging evil deeds as such, that the State punishes, Else it 
would deal with the vices which degrade men and dishonor 
their nature as well as with the crimes which injure society. 
Still less is it purely with a view to the reformation of the 
wrong-doer that the community punishes its members. Of 
course when the miscreant is once in our hands, and the State 
assumes the responsibility of regulating his life, it is right to 
take the discipline as useful and reformatory as is consistent 
with due severity in the punishment. But this is not the first 
object. We do not keep up our costly and elaborate system of 
police and prisons mainly as an educational institution on be- 
half of that class of persons which least deserves the nation’s 
solicitude. The object of the whole system of punishment is 
the protection of society by the prevention of crime. “You 
are not sent to prison,” said a magistrate to a thief, “for pick- 
ing a pocket, but in order that pockets may not be picked.* 
Now it is evident that in this respect the School and the State 
are essentially different, The one concerns itself with the act 
done and its effect on the rights and welfare of the community; 
but the other concerns itself chiefly with the doer of the act. 
That which is to the lawgiver only a secondary and subordi- 
nate object, is to the ruler of the school the first object, the dis- 
cipline or improvement of the offenders. If he punishes, he 
cannot of course keep out of view the moral effect of the pun- 
ishment on those who might otherwise be tempted to do wrong; 
but his main object is to bring the pupil who has strayed, 
back again into the right path—the path of obedience and of 
duty. 
There are two principal forms of punishment—-those which

tive their force from the fact that they are meant to be pun- 
ishments, and are known to be so. A glance of rebuke, a word 
or tone of anger, disgrace or degradation in the eye of others, 
Joss of office or of confidence, a low place in a list of marks for

merit; all these are forms of punishment belonging to the sec- 
ond class; while detention from play, the loss of holidays or of 
entertainments, the withholding of some pleasant ingredient 
from a meal, confinement, the imposition of unpleasant tasks. 
and actual castigation belong to the first class. And as we 
enumerate these, and perhaps think of others which our own 
ingenuity has devised, the first thought which occurs to us all, 
is how happy we should be if we could rid ourselves altogether 
of this kind of duty; and how great an object it is in all good 
discipline to reduce the necessity for punishment to a minimum. 
. All these instruments of torture are in our hands. But it is ob- 
vious that we should never use the more formidable instrument 
if the less formidable can be made to serve the purpose. While 
the eye commands respect, the voice is unnecessary; while a 
gentle rebuke will suffice, the harder tones of indignation and 
remonstrance should not be used, And it is not till the voice 
ceases to be obeyed at all, that we should resort to severer 
measures. It is one of the first objects of a wise ruler to dis- 
pense with the necessity of inflicting punishment altogether. 
But as this cannot always be accomplished, one or two princi- 
ples about its infliction may be usefully kept in view. 
Remember that secondary punishments intended to work upon 
The sense the sense of shame seldom succeed. One reason 
of ahame, is that they are so unequal. They fall so differ- 
ently on different natures. The kind of disgrace which wounds 
a sensitive child to the quick and weakens his self-respect for 
years, falls harmless on a bolder, harder nature, and gives no 
pain at all. Many very good teachers, though, I am glad to 
say, a decreasing number, think it possible to produce a salu- tary effect on children by humiliating them in the eyes of others, Joseph Lancaster, who showed a shrewd insight into many matters of education, was curiously unwise in this respect, He 
invented a number of penalties designed expressly to make wrong-doing ridiculous. He would tie a boy who had broken 
a rule to one of the pillars of the school. He had a pulley fixed in the roof, and a rope and a basket, and would put an

offender into the basket, and let him be drawn up in the sight 
of the whole school, and remain there suspended for its amuse- 
ment. All such devices are happily extinct. Fools’ caps and 
stools of repentance in schools have gone the way of the stocks, 
of the pillory, and of public floggings in the criminal code of 
the nation; because they were all founded on the same vicious 
principle, of trying to prevent wrong-doing by making fun of 
it, and by exposing the offender to scorn and ridicule. You 
degrade an entire community when you enable its members to 
get any amusement out of the procedure of justice, or out of 
the sufferings of a criminal. 
And I think the use of sarcasm and of ridicule in the treat- 
ment of children, even when we do not punish 
them, is equally out of harmony with a wise and 
high-minded moral discipline. Some of us have a natural gift 
for satire and for wit; and it is very hard to abstain from the 
exercise of this weapon, whenever there is anything in  child’s 
conduct to excite our scorn or sense of the ridiculous. But it is 
a dangerous weapon nevertheless, and we should put a severe 
restraint upon ourselves in the use of it. We must not so treat 
wrong-doing as to weaken the self-respect of the scholar, and to 
make the way to reformation steeper or more thorny than it is. 
Is it needful that I should warn any one here against setting 
tasks for punishments? I believe, however, that Tasks as pun- 
they are still sometimes used for this purpose, and ishments. 
Iam astonished to find in a modern book containing so much 
that is wise and philosophical as Mr. Bain’s Hducation as a 
Science, a recognition of tasks and impositions as legitimate 
punishments, because “the pain of intellectual ennui is severe 
to those that have no liking for books in any shape.” One 
might have hoped that this doctrine at least would ere this have 
been swept away ‘‘into the limbo large and broad” of obsolete 
heresies. For what possible effect can be produced by all our 
homilies as to the profit and pleasantness of learning if by our 
own act we admit that a lesson may serve as a punishment ? 
“Because you have disobeyed me you shall have a harder or a 
8 Ridicule.
-P-A-G-E-115

longer lesson to-night.” What is this but to reveal that you 
think learning a lesson is a kind of penal servitude? And this 
is a thing we should never even tacitly admit. First because it 
ought not to be true, and secondly because it will soon become 
true if you show that you believe it to be so. Of course this 
remark does not apply to the making up for some neglect by 
finishing a lesson in play-hours. It is a legitimate thing, if a 
duty of any kind is not performed at the proper time, to insist 
on its finished performance before the scholar begins to enjoy 
his leisure. And in this sense, detention indoors to go over 
again some neglected lesson, though it looks like a punishment, 
is right and lawful. For it is not the lesson in this case which - 
constitutes the punishment, but the expenditure of time needed 
to make up for former waste. And this, as you will see, is a 
very different thing from setting the lesson itself as a penalty 
for wrong-doing of some other kind. 
And in punishing never let your indignation betray you inte 
Blame shoula ™&king your blame too comprehensive, or out of

honestly do so, as exceptional, not typical, as one which may 
be atoned for, and the memory of which may be obliterated by a right act. . To call a child by an evil name is to assume that 
his character is formed, and this happily is not true even of your worst scholars. If it were true, what could be more dis- couraging, more fatal to the success of any poor struggles he may make to set himself ri, ight, and to regain your approbation? May Tadd also that punishments should vever be inflicted on too Many ata time, on a whole class for instance?

ment fails to produce any moral effect. 
Rousseau and Mr. Herbert Spencer have said much, and 
have said it well, about the evil of arbitrary pun- ay, discipline 
ishments, which have no intelligible fitness or of conse- 
relation to the nature of the fault committed. And %°?°*S | 
Istrongly recommend every teacher to read what is said in 
Emile, and in the chapter on Moral Education in Mr. Spencer’s 
well-known book. Those authors point out that nature pun- 
ishes faults in a very effective way. If one goes too neara fire 
he is burnt; if he plays with a knife he hurts himself; and in 
like manner, if a child carelessly loses samething belonging to 
him, he should feel the inconvenience of going without it, and 
not have it at once replaced bya kind but injudicious parent. 
Hf he is unpunctual he should not be waited for when any walk 
or pleasure is to be had, but should be left behind; if he is un- 
tidy and makes a litter he should be made to gather it up, 
‘When in this way the inconvenience suffered is seen to be the 
direct consequence of the fault, a child cannot rebelas he could, 
for example, if for doing any one of these things he was sent 
to bed. You eliminate altogether the feeling of personal resent- 
ment and the sense of injustice if you make the punishment 
thus, whenever possible, obviously appropriate to the fault and jf 
logically its sequel. The principle, once seen, covers a good 
many school offences, The obvious punishment for late com- 
ing is late going; for doing an exercise ill is to do it again well; ff 
for wasting the time in school is to forfeit some of the hours of || 
leisure; for all invasion of the rights and comforts of others is 
to find one’s own privileges or comforts restricted; for injury 
to the property of others, restitution at one’s own cost. And 
from this point of view it will be seen how unsatisfactory is the 
discipline when for telling a lie one has to learn a hundred lines iif 
of Virgil; or for confounding the perfect with the pluperfect jj 
tense to receive a flogging. In the former cases the discipline 
commendsitself to the conscience of the child. In te latter hig

how idleness begets poverty; how the liar is not trusted; how

think that the utilitarian philosophers are right in urging us to 
teach in our schools-some of the simpler truths of economic 
science, the laws of industrial and social life, which will en- 
able the scholars thus to trace out the connection between con- 
duct and well-being, between all faults and their natural 
penalties,” But valuable as such teaching is, experience proves 
to us that it is wholly inadequate as a theory of moral govern- 
ment either for a school or for a State.

inaccessible to such considerations; and society for iis own pro- 
tection is justified in interposing with its artificial penalties, 
which are sharper and more effective.

you leave him alone Nature will avenge the violation of her 
laws by enfeebling his constitution and depriving him prema-

penalty you wish to avoid; and you subject him to some pain-

aheavy one. You see a man rushing towards a precipice, and 
you knock him down. What justifies this act of violence? 
Nothing, except that by the infliction of a small and wholly

It is a familiar conclusion from experience that in a school, 
as in a State, it is the cértainty rather than the ‘ne certainty

was absolutely certain, the dread of consequences, 
whether natural or arbitrary, would be much more potent.

the knowledge of these and the like facts which will always 
leave something more to be desired, when you are seeking to 
deter children from evil; by the utilitarian method of tracing 
out that evil to its consequences. And what is that something? 
I believe it to lie in the constant reference of moral questions ta 
higher considerations than those of expediency and of results— 
to the inward sense of right and of moral fitness, to the senti- 
ment of honor “which feels,” as Burke finely says, ‘‘a stain 
like a wound,” to a perception of the beauty of holiness, to the 
desire to do what our heavenly Father meant us to do and to 
‘be what he fitted us to be, whether happiness and prosperity

And as you succeed in cultivating the sentiment of honor and

to pass that your most effective punishments—indeed almost 
your only punishments—will consist in the loss of honor. Bad 
marks, a low place in the class, the withholding of office and

after all fulfil in the best way the two most important conditions 
of ail right punishment. For there is nothing arbitrary or ca- Pricious about them, since they are the natural and appropriate 
consequences of the faults to which they pertain. And at the same time they are eminently reformatory; for they indicate clearly the way to repentance and improvement. So my counsel to all schoolmasters is: Look in this direction for the punish- 
ments which you may lawfully and wisely use: and be dissatis- fied with yourself and with your own plan of discipline so long 
as you find it needful to employ any others. Yet we must not omit a brief reference to corporal punish- Corporal ment, the ultima ratio of the puzzled and baffied . schoolmaster. when all other means fail, Shall we begin by denouncing it altogether?

unsuited to the imperfect state of their mental and moral develop- 
ment, Arnold, though I suspect that his views on this subject 
would have altered in later years, was not wholly wrong when - 
he vindicated flogging in certain extreme cases. ‘The proud 
notion of independence and dignity which revolts at the idea 
of personal chastisement is not reasonable and is certainly not 
Christian,” he said. After all it is sin which degrades and not 
the punishment of it. And if there be certain forms of vice 
which can be cured more readily by the infliction of such chas- 
tisement than by any other means, the chastisement will need 
no other vindication. And yet while allowing full weight to 
this view of the case, I am convinced that corporal punishment 
is almost wholly unnecessary, that it does more harm than good, 
and that in just the proportion in which teachers understand 
their business they will learn to dispense with it, In boarding 
schools it seems to me wholly indefensible; for there, where 
the whole discipline of the life and the control of leisure is in 
the teacher’s hands, there are many other ways open to him of 
imposing penalties. And there is scarcely less necessity for it in 
day schools. The largest and one of the best day schools I ever 
examined, where the whole tone of the discipline is singularly 
high,-manly, and cheerful, has never once during its whole his- 
tory had a case of corporal punishment. But the master, when 
.I was reporting on the school, begged me not to mention this 
fact. “I do not mean to use it,” he said, ‘but I do not want 
it to be in the power of the public or the parents to say I am 
precluded from using it. Every boy here knows that it is with- 
in my discretion, and that if a very grave or exceptional fault 
occurred I might exercise that discretion.” I believe that to be 
the true attitude for all teachers to assume. They should not 
have their discretion narrowed by any outward law, but they 
should impose a severe law on themselves. And in carrying it 
out I venture to mike two or three suggestions only: 
(1) Never inflict corporal chastisement for intellectual faults; 
for stupidity or ignorance. Reserve it exclusively for vices, 
for something morally degrading. (2) Never inflict it while

under the influence of heat or passion. (8) Never permit an 
assistant or an elder scholar to inflict it in any circumstances. 
(4) Do not let any instrument of punishment be included as 
part of the school furniture, and as an object of familiar sight, 
or flourished about as a symbol of authority. (5) Do not strike 
with the hand. 
On this whole subject of the mode and manner of inflicting 
punishment you will find some useful hints in Jeremy Ben- 
tham’s Chrestomathia, which I advise every teacher to read. 
But we return finally to this consideration. The great tri-

severe, to have no element of caprice or fitfulness in it; if the

putit. We are here at the meeting point of practice and of 
speculative psychology; and it is impossible for you or me to 
arrive at entirely right rules of action in reference to this sub- 
ject unless our attention is also directed to the nature of the in- 
tellectual process which we call remembering, and to the laws 
which determine its action. I shali however abstain from en- 
croaching on the domain of my successor here, whose duty it 
will be to expound to you the philosophy of memory. But it 
may be well to say that this line of inquiry will prove very 
fruitful, and that some study of what Locke, Reid, Dr. Thomas 
Brown, and Professor Bain have said on the laws of associa- 
tion, of what Dr. Carpenter and Dr. Maudsley have said 
respecting the physical basis of memory; and of the wise and 
practical distinction which Mr. Latham in his book on Exami- 
nations has drawn between what he calls respectively the ‘‘ por- 
tative,” the “analytical,” the ‘“assimilative,” and the “index” 
Memory would be of great value in forming your own judg- 
ment upon it. 
For my present purpose. it must suffice to mention one or two 
very simple truths as a basis for the few practical a4 law 
rules which we hope to arrive at on this important of mental 
matter. By a wonderful process, which is some- *"S8°5tion. 
times called mental suggestion or association, we find that every
-P-A-G-E-123
122 Learning and Remembering.   
thought and action in our life links itself with some other 
thought or action. No piece of mental or spiritual experience 
is thoroughly isolated. No act, even of sensible perception, 
takes place without associating itsclf with some previous 
thought, or suggesting a new one. When we come to analyze 
these phenomena we find that there are, roughly distinguish- 
able, two classes of associations. We may, when we are told 
of a fact, think also of the reason or consequence of that fact; 
and two distinct ideas may come before our minds together, 
because we perceive the logical nevus which unites them, 
Thus the thought of a good vintage in France suggests to me 
that claret may be cheaper; the history of Caxton and the early 
printers may make me think of the revival of learning; heavy 
_War expenditures suggests national debt; bad government sug- 
gests revolution. In like manner a particular problem in 
Euclid reminds me of the axioms and postulates on which its 
solution depends; and a solecism in speech makes me think of 
the grammatical rule which has been violated. In all these 
cases the character of the associations which are formed, and 
the ease with which they may hereafter be recalled together, 
depend on the degree in which the judgment and the reflec- 
ie power have been cultivated on the subjects to which they 
Telate. . . 
But besides these logical and natural associations, as we may call them, there are many others which are purely arbitrary, 
in which there is no special appropriateness in the connection formed. Such are the associations between names and persons, between dates and facts, between words and ideas, between weights or measures and the figures representing their ratios, between contemporaneous events in different countries, Now 
in all these cases no judgment or reflection will help me to 
strengthen the association. If the link between the things thus 
related exists at all it must be forged by some mechanical pro- 
cess. I am told that Columbus discovered America in 1492, 
but there is no reason in the world which my understanding 
can recognize why the date should not have been 1452. The

books tell me that there are 5} yds. in a pole, and I think of 
the word pole and these figures together, but I do not establish 
this association by any rational process. It is established, if at 
all, by some other means, ‘The suggestion is one of words 
rather than of thoughts, 
Now, if we will consider it, the main differences in the men- 
tal calibre and character of men depend largely pigorent 
upon the sort of ideas which habitually or most forms of 
readily coalesce in their minds. To a man of ons. 
strong or lofty imagination a very common incident may sug 
gest some hidden moral analogies, or far-reaching truth: 
“To him the meanest flower that blows doth give 
Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears.” 
And such a man we call a poet. In the case of another man, 
every-striking scene in the phantasmagoria of life sets him re- 
flecting on its antecedents and consequences; and such a man 
has the philosophic temper, he is the reasoner, the moralist, the 
sage. To a third the sound of a word suggests only some gro- 
tesque simile, some remote allusion, some idea, which though 
essentially different, has a superficial resemblance. And such 
@ person is the man of fancy or of wit. But when on hearing 
a word, or being reminded of a scene, the mind at once passes 
to the other words or actions which were linked with it when 
we recognized it at first; when it simply recalls a certain group 
of words or thoughts in the same sequence as that in which they 
were before presented; then we say the man has a good memory, 
He can in fact reproduce readily former associations, whether 
logical or not. 
Consider for a moment the process which goes on when we 
try to remember a fact. You ask me the name Of we process 
the statesman who tried so hard to set poor Louis of remember- 
XVI.’s finances in order, and I cannot remember 
it. Of course, if I knew the first letter of the name, that would 
give me a clue, and I should wait till that initial suggested to 
Ie 8 Dumber of names, should fasten with special attention on
-P-A-G-E-125
124 Learning and Remembering. 
likely names, and dismiss as fast as T could other names, which, 
though beginning with the same letter, were not, I know, what 
were wanted. But I do not remember the initial. So I let my 
mind dwell for 4 moment on Louis XVI. As I do so, the names of Calonne, of La Fayette, even of Burke and Pitt occur 
tome. They are not what I want, and I refuse to let my mind 
dwell on them. I think of Madame de Statl. Stop, she was 
the daughter of the statesman whose name I seek. Of Gibbon: 
that reminds me that he had sought the same lady in marriage. 
Then Geneva and Lausanne and Ferney and Voltaire, all 
names which are connected, come rapidly through my mind, 
and in the midst of them Wecker’s name is suggested, and I 
fasten on it at once. It is what I wanted. 
Now you will observe here that: it is not by any conscious act 
that I have remembered this namo, I cannot be said to have 
found it, or dug it up from the stores of my memory. These 
metaphors are very misleading. What I have done is simply 
this: I have waited for the laws of association to operate, and 
for the wonderful spontaneous power of mental suggestion to 
‘help me, An effort of will served to bring my attention to bear on those suggestions which, as they emerged, seemed 
most hopeful; I withdrew my attention from all unpromising 
trains of association, and in due time the particular name of 
which I was in search came back. If I had had a better memory it would have come back sooner, or with less effort. Now this faculty of remembering is one which we constantly want to use in our teaching. What would be the worth of any teaching without it? We desire of course to stimulate the power of fresh thought, to make children. observers, reasoners, thinkers, But the first thing we demand of them is that they should recollect what we teach. If we have been at the pains to link together two things, say a word and its meaning, a fact and a date, or two thoughts by way of comparison or contrast, Wwe waut the process of linking them to be so effective, that when- ever afterwards the one is Presented to the mind, the other shall come with it. Unless the associations of thought and words

which we seek to establish are permanent, there is imper- 
fect memory; and if the memory is imperfect, our labor is 
lost. 
So it is obvious that we ought to inquire into the conditions 
which give permanence to associations once Modes of es- 
brought before the mind. How are we to fix permanent 
them? There are two obvious ways: associations, 
The first of them is that of frequent repetition, We learn 
to fix many pairs of associated words or ideas to- (1) ment 
gether, not because we try to do so, but simply "epetition. 
because circumstances bring them constantly before us in jux- 
taposition.!. Thus we learn the names of the people about us, 
the sequence of words in familiar texts and verses, the colloca- 
tion of objects in the houses and streets we sec every day. 
Suggest any one of these to the mind, and instantly those 
which are related to it by mere contiguity come up before 
us in connection whether we care to recall them or not. I 
might to-day by simply reiterating the same sentence fifty times 
make such an impression on your mind that you would never 
forget it. The effect of mere frequency of repetition, in fasten-

a functional disposition to its reproduction or reappearance in con- 
sciousness at some future time. Of no mental act can we say that it is 
‘writ in water.’ Something remains from it whereby its recurrence is 
facilitated. Every impression of sense upon the brain, every current of 
molecular activity from one to another part of the brain, every cerebral 
reaction which passes into movement, leaves behind it some modifica- 
tion of the nerve-elements concerned in its function, some after-effect, 
or, $0 to speak, memory of itself in them, which renders its reproduc- 
tion an easier matter, the more easy the more often it has been repeat- 
ed, and makes it impossible to say that, however trivial, it shall not in

  ~ 
ing together even the most incongruous associations, is so 
familiar to you that it needs no further ilJustration. 
The second condition of remembering is the interest or sym- 
® Interest in Pathy with which we regard the things associated, 
6 thing I go to hear a lecture on English Literature, and 
incidentally there are mentioned in the course of 
it two facts, the one that Phineas Fletcher wrote the Purple 
Island, the other that James Thomson wrote Rule Britannia in 
a‘mask of his called Alfred. Well, it probably happens that the 
one fact interests me and the other does not. I never heard of 
Fletcher before, and have not cared to inquire what the Purple 
Island meant. But I have often heard Rule Britannia sung, 
and perhaps it never occurred to me to inquire who wrote it. 
That a rather vain-glorious, noisy, patriotic song should have 
been written by James Thomson, whose name I have been 
accustomed to associate with pastoral musings, and sweet luxu- 
tious fancies about the Castle of Indolence, comes to me as a 
surprise. A month later, it is found that I have forgotten all 
about the Purple Island, but I remember vividly the origin of 
Rule Britatinia. And “the reason is plain, It is true, I heard 
both facts once only. But then the one fact excited my atten- 
tion and interest, and the other did not; and this accounts for 
the difference. 
Now. the obvious conclusion from this is, that if you want to 
have a thing remembered you may do it in either of two ways. 
You may fasten it by dint of frequent repetition into the 
~ memory of one who does not care to retain it; or you may get 
the thing remembered simply by exciting in your pupil a strong 
wish to remember it. And the labor involved in the two pro- 
cesses may be stated in inverse proportion: the more you use the 
one expedient the less you want of the other. The act of re- 
membering may be a mechanical, almost an automatic, process, 
or it may be an intelligent process, But in just the proportion 
in which you make it intelligent it ceases to be mechanical, 
and conversely. Every emotion of sympathy and interest you 
can awaken will render less necessary the wearisome joyless pro- learned,

cess of learning a task by heart. Let it be kept in your own 
view, and in that of your pupils, that the first condition of easy 
remembering is that we care to remember, that if we havea bad 
memory it is not nature’s fault, but it is simply because we do 
not put sufficient force of will into the act of tying together the 
ideas which we propose to keep associated. Promise children 
some pleasure, and they will find no difficulty in remembering 
it. To say that we do not recollect a thing is simply to say that 
we did not pay sufficiently close attention to it when it was 
first brought before our minds. 
And what is the kind of memory we want most to cultivate? 
Is it the memory of words, or of the things and yonet ana 
facts represented by those words? Is it the con- rational 
crete memory which carries accurate impressions memory. 
of visual pictures or of sounds, or is it the abstract memory 
which retains the gist and meaning of what has been heard and 
seen? No doubt it is good to secure each of these kinds of 
power. Some people who are keen at remembering the rela- 
tions between events, and the substance of what they hear, have 
‘a difficulty in remembering mere names and words. But if 
we were to choose, and could only secure one, we should prefer 
to have the memory for things their causes, effects, and mutual 
relations, rather than the power of mere verbal reminiscence. 
In schools, however, we want both, and it is a great point in 
education to know when to cultivate the one, and when to aim 
at the other. If you hear a pupil demonstrate a proposition in 
Euclid, you want memory of course, but it is the memory of a 
logical sequence, and not of particular words. In fact, if you 
have any reason to suspect that he has learned it by heart, you 
at once change A, B, C on the diagram to X, Y, Z, or adopt 
some other device to bafile him. For to turn what is meant as 
a discipline in ratiocination into an exercise of purely verbal 
memory destroys the whole value of the lesson, and makes 
nonsense of it, And if you have been giving a lesson on His- 
tory, and have described say the period of the English Revoly- 
tion—the attempt at the dispensing power, the trial of the seven
-P-A-G-E-129
128 Learning and Remembering. 
  
bishops, the bigotry of James II. and the final catastrophe: 
you want all these facts to be linked together in their due cor- 
relation as causes and effects; and when they are reproduced to 
come up again as facts, in words supplied by your pupil and 
representing his own thoughts, not in the particular words 
which you happened to use in teaching, In these cases Mon- 
taigne’s aphorism applies with special force, Savoir par cour 
west pas savoir. Nothing would be gained, but much would 
be lost, if instead of requiring him thus to recall the events in 
his own way, you set him to learn by heart some sentences 
from a history book in which those facts were summarized. 
The associations you want to fix in the memory here are of 
events, not of words or phrases. , 
Are there then no occasions on which it is wise and desirable 
5 a to establish verbal associations and to require them 
heart when to be committed to memory, or to use a common 
Tegitimal expression, to be learned by heart? Undoubtedly 
~ there are. Let us look at them. 
: (1) There are in arithmetic and in all the exact sciences cer_ 
tain formule which are frequently in use, which have con- 
stantly to be referred to, and which we want to use at a mo- 
ment’s notice. The multiplication table for example. 7 times 
9 make 68. The association hetween these figures is apparently 
arbitrary. Reflection and reasoning would not help me much 
to know that they do not make 58; and when I am working a 
problem in which the fact is available, I do not want to reason 
or reflect at all. The two figures should suggest 63 instantane- 
ously. by a mechanical process, and without a moment's 
thought, So it is good to know that the relation of the diame. 
ter to the circumference of a circle is expressed by the figures 
4 and 3.14159, because this fact is often wanted in working 
out problems in mensuration, and furnishes a key to the rapid estimation of the sizes of familiar things, In the case of each of these terse and fruitful formule, we observe that there is 
one thing right and everything else is wrong; there should be
-P-A-G-E-130

no mistake at all in our minds in regard to the exact truth; and 
the frequency with which the formula becomes of use fully 
justifies us in the labor of committing it to memory. 
@) There are some things which we want to remember in 
substance, but which are best remembered in one particular 
form. Geometrical definitions and axioms, and some rules in 
Latin syntax, are of this kind. They have been carefully re- 
duced to the simplest form of expression, it is specially neces- 
sary that they should be applied with perfect accuracy, and 
we therefore do well to have them in our mind in one fixed 
and concise form. 
(8) Again, there are some things which deserve to be remem- 
bered as much on account of the special form they assume as 
on that of the truths they embody. If the language in which 
a truth is conveyed has any special authority, any historic signi- 
ficance, or any poetical beauty, the language itself becomes a 
thing worth appropriating, over and above the thoughts con- 
veyed in that language. So verses of poetry, passages from 
great writers and orators, formularies of faith, wise maxims in. 
which, as Lord Russell said, the wisdom of many has been 
fixed and concentrated by the wit of one—all these are worth 
learning by heart. The memory is enriched by a store of strong 
thoughts or of graceful expressions;—a great and pregnant pas- 
sage from Shakespeare, a few fervid and finished sentences 
from an oration of Burke, a piece of jewelled eloquence from 
one of Jeremy Taylor’s sermons, a quaint aphorism from old 
Fuller, a sweet restful poem by Wordsworth, or some devout 
spiritual utterance of George Herbert or Keble, has a precious- 
ness of its own which depends rather on its artistic excellence 
as @ specimen of language, than on its value as a statement of 
truth. And it is this very artistic excellence which gives it its 
special claim to lie garnered in the store-house of memory. 
The possessor of such a store has a resource in hours of weari- 
ness or dulness, when thoughts are sluggish and imagination is 
weak. He goes back and finds that by recalling such utter-

ances his thoughts are stimulated and his emotions ennobled.' 
But this would not happen if the words themselves were not 
felt to have a fitness and beauty of their own, 
There is therefore a right use and a wrong use of what I have 
for my present purpose called by the rather unscientific name 
of the “‘ verbal memory,” or what is generally known as “‘learn- 
ing by heart,” This too is not a felicitous phrase, for of all 
conceivable employments for the human understanding, this 
kind of task work has the least “heart” in it, No doubt many 
teachers have been accustomed to rely too much on the power 
of remembering words. It is the easiest of all forms of school- 
keeping to say ‘‘Go and learn that lesson, and then come and 
say it to me;” and accordingly, setting tasks to be learned by 
heart is the chief, almost the only, resource of teachers who 
cannot teach and are content to be mere pedagogic machines. 
But theri the opposite of wrong is not always right; and in the 
reaction. against a system which relied wholly on the memory 
and never appealed to the judgment, we may very easily make 
another mistake equally great by discrediting and undervaluing 
the memory, by treating it as the Cinderella in the household 
of the human faculties, useful merely as a drudge, 
We are, I hope, prepared now to come to a true conclusion 
. 48 to the right use of this great educational instru- giple pre ment. And this is the conclusion. When the 
* object is to have thoughts, facts, reasonings repro- duced, seek to have them reproduced in the pupil’s own words. Do not set the faculty of mere verbal memory to work. But when the words themselves in which a fact is embodied have some special fitness or beauty of their own, when they repre- sent some scientific datum or central truth, which could not 
otherwise be so well expressed, then see that the form as well 
as the substance of the expression is learned by heart.

And, having once determined that this is worth doing, see 
that it is thoroughly done. It is of no value to tThorough- 
learn a thing by heart unless it is learned so thor- &*- 
oughly that it can be recalled without the least mistake and at 
& moment’s notice. Other lessons, in which the understanding 
is chiefly concerned, may be only partially successful, and yet 
be of some use. A lesson half understood is better than no les- 
son at all. But a memoriter lesson half learned—said with a 
few promptings, and blundered through just well enough to 
escape serious blame—is sure to be forgotten directly after- 
wards, and simply comes to nothing. Yes, it does come to 
something, It leaves behind it a sense of wasted time and a 
disgust for the whole subject to which it relates, That is 
all. 
. Grant also that, for some such good reason as I have named, 
you determine to set certain lessons to be learned prow to com- 
by heart, it is well to give pupils a hint as to the mit to mem- 
conditions under which the memory lays hold of a ory 
lesson best. Sitting down immediately after a lesson to commit a 
task to memory is a bad plan, for the mind is not then in its most 
receptive state. All persons do not commit tasks to memory un- 
der precisely the same conditions, so no universal rule can be 
laid down, To many, the morning when the mind is fresh is the 
best time. As a rule, the cerebral activity is said to be at its 
height within two or three hours after the first meal of the day. 
Many find the easiest way of learning by heart is to con over 
the lesson just before going to bed, and then they discover that 
in the morning it all comes to them with much-greater clear- 
ness, Some philosophical writers have pointed out that there 
is such a thing as unconscious cerebration, a process of mind 
going on in sleep, and at other times when we are not con- 
scious, whereby impressions made before are not only fixed, 
but even more clearly apprehended. We cannot now discuss 
this theory; but it is certain that to many minds the expedient 
of learning a thing over night is found exceedingly helpful in’ 
economizing the conscious effort of the brain, and causes the

over again. But a lesson which is turned round and round in 
the mind again, and made the subject of rumination, even for 
a few minutes, is sure to become part of the permanent furni- 
ture of the mind. We do not want to let schoo!-work encroach 
on the whole domain of life, and haunt a thoughtful scholar in 
all his hours of leisure. But we may not forget that the old 
way in which the Jews were exhorted to teach their children 
the commandments of the Lord in ages when there were no 
books, was a true way. ‘Thou shalt teach them diligently to 
thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thy 
house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou 
liest down, and when thou risest up.” Whatever we make a 
subject of reflection at odd times, when the thoughts are at 
leisure, is sure to be remembered. If a scholar can only be 
trained to the habit of giving ten minutes a day, in a walk, or in 
  
1 “Whatever the organic process in the brain, it takes place, like the 
action of other elements of the body, quite out of the reach of con- 
sciousness. We are not aware how our general and abstract ideas are 
formed; the due material is consciously supplied, and there is an uncon- 
scious elaboration of the result. Mental development thus represents a 
sort of nutrition and organization; or as Milton aptly says of the opin- 
ions of good men, that they are truth in the making, so we may truly 
say of the formation of our general and complex ideas, that it is mind 
in the making. When the individual brain is a well-constituted one and 
has been duly cultivated, the results of its latent activity, rising into 
consciousness suddenly, sometimes seem like intuitions; they are 
strange and startling as the products of a dream ofttimes are to the 
person who has actually produced them. Hence it was no extravagant 
fancy in Plato to look upon them as reminiscences of a previous higher 
existence. His brain was a brain of the highest order, and the results of 
its unconscious activity, as they flashed into consciousness, would show 
like revelations, and might well seem intuitions of a higher life quite beyond the reach of present will.”—Dr. CARPENTER,

Strengthening the Memory. 138 
  
a quiet evening, to asking himself, ‘‘ What have I learned, and 
why have I learned it?” and to the act of trying to recall it, 
and to think out some illustration of it, he is sure to make great 
and true progress, 
There is onc very common excuse often urged by those who 
make an excessive use of task-work in teaching. yomo, “ 
You complain of their setting poor scrappy little rene ened ex: rise. 
passages of grammar, history, or geography to be ® 
learned by heart. You point out to them that sentences of this 
kind would be worthless even to an educated man. And the 
answer is, they are useful because they strengthen the memory. 
That is quite true. So it would strengthen my memory if I 
learned the leading article of this morning’s Ttmes by heart, or 
the names of all the Senior Wranglers in regular order from the 
beginning of the century. Moreover it is just conceivable that 
some day these acquisitions would turn out to be of value. In 
like manner, it would strengthen the muscles of a man’s arm 
if he were on every alternate morning to dig a hole in his gar- 
den, and on the second morning regularly and laboriously fill 
it up again. But it is better perhaps that he should get this 
exercise in digging up something that needs to be dug. The 
truth is that life is not long enough, and our faculties are not 
potent enough, to justify us in strengthening the memory by 
learning what is not worth remembering. ‘You may get 
the same discipline for your faculties by learning something 
which has a value of its own; and unless what you propose to 
lay up in store in a child’s mind has such real value, and is of 
such a kind that you yourself would find it fruitful and well 
worth possessing in after-life, the use you mean to make of the 
faculty is illegitimate and unwise. 
Now in the light of the principles thus laid down let me ask 
myself one or two questions. Shall Tlearnby heart gests of 
alist of the prepositions which govern a dative, and ent and as 
of the prepositions which govern an ablative, in of memory 
Latin? Yes. For these are idiomatic laws which 8". 
are essential to me in Latin composition as well as in translation:

they are largely arbitrary, and I could not recall them easily by 
any effort of reflection. Sball I learn the definitions of the 
parts of speech given by grammarians? No. “An article is a 
word placed before a noun to show the extent of its meaning.”. 
If 1 did not know what an article is without the help of this 
definition, I should never tell it by means of it. Moreover, 
there are a good many other ways of defining parts of speech 
quite as good as those in any given grammar, and so long as I 
know thoroughly the distinction itself, the more varied is the 
form in which I can define it the better. Shall I learn the 
number of yards in a mile, the formula for the square of (a+ 2), 
or the trigonometrical expression for the area of a triangle in . 
terms of its sides? Yes. For these are central and most ser- 
viceable truths, constantly wanted in the solution of problems, 
and often wanted in a hurry. Will it be well to learn the logarithms of all numbers up to 100, the number of pints in a 
hogshead, or the number of inches in a Flemish ell? No, I 
think I will not encumber my memory with facts so seldom 
wanted, so little known outside of a school-room, and so very 
easy to find, if by chance there should be any occasional need for them. Shall I set my pupils to learn by heart an extract from Scott’s Marmion? Well, I think not. For it is not likely 
to have any unity of its own. It is a fragment of a longer 
narrative, and is unintelligible without the rest; and since it is 
unreasonable to expect that the rest will be remembered, the 
fragment will soon drop out of recollection altogether. Shall 
I set him to learn part of Goldsmith’s Traveller, or Gray’s 
Elegy, or Wordsworth’s Ode on Immortality? Yes. For every 
couplet here is a picture or thought in itself. Any one line ‘will help to recall the lines related to it; and even if it does not do so, it has a value and suggestiveness of its own. Shall I Jearn the dates of the English kings, the latitude of London, and, at least approximately, the size of this island, and the pop- ulation of its five or six largest towns? Yes, because England is my home, because it interests me more than any other place in the world, and because all these facts will be useful as fixed

points of comparison round which all my constantly increasing 
acquaintance with it and its history, and with other places, will 
cluster and arrange itself. Shall I learn the dates of the Popes, 
a list of the departments of France, the figures which give me 
the length of the Mississippi, or the latitude and longitude of 
Timbuctoo? No, I think I would rather not know these 
things. I should like to know where the book is where I can 
find them on the rare occasions on which I may want them, 
and I should also like to know how to consult it, What Mr. 
Latham calls the Index memory is all I want here, the knowl- 
edge of where to look for what I want, and how to look for it. 
But as to carrying such lumber about as part of my’ mental 
furniture through life, I will certainly not do it, unless you 
compel me; and if you-force me to learn it, I will try to forget 
it as soon as Iam out of your reach. Shall I learn the Creed, 
the Lord’s Prayer and the Ten Commandments by heart? 
‘Well—assuming of course that I accept them as true representa- 
tions of my faith and duty—certainly. For they are venerable 
formularies, which come to us with very sacred associations 
and with a great weight of authority. They have shaped the 
conduct and guided the devotions of my Christian forefathers 
for centuries, and they are presumably expressed in the choicest, 
tersest, and most weighty words which tradition has been able 
to bestow upon us. Shall I learn by: heart the historical com- 
pendium of the ingenious Mangnall? Not if I can help it. Let 
me read to you two or three questions and answers from that 
author, . 
What became of the Druids? They were almost entirely extirpated 
when the Roman general Suetonius Paulinus took the island, or Anglesea, 
in the year 61, and Agricola a second time in 78, 
How were the public events transmitted to posterity when the Britons 
were ignorant of printing and writing? By their bards or poets, who 
were the only depositaries of national events. 
What Roman emperor projected an invasion of Britain, gathered 
only shells upon the coast, and then returned to Rome in triumph? Ca- 
ligula, in the year 40. 
What British generals distinguished themseives before the Saxon

Heptarchy was formed? Cassivelaunus, defeated by Julius Cesar in 54 
B.c., and Caractacus, defeated and taken by Ostorius in 51 4.D., and sent. 
@ prisoner to Rome in the following year. 
What was the exclamation of Caractacus when led in triumph 
through Rome? How is it possible that a people possessed of such mag- 
nificence should envy me a humble cottage in Britain! 
Now suppose I learn this lesson by heart, you observe that 
Books of _every answer consists of about one third or fourth 
question and of a statement, of which all the rest lies in the 
answer. question. And the question is not learnt by heart. 
So the fragment actually committed to memory is incomplete 
and means nothing. Even if the question were remembered, 
the separate facts thus learned are incoherent and unrelated, 
and so, though concerned with one of the most interesting of 
all subjects, are made profoundly uninteresting. To print a 
book of questions and answers is to assume that there is to be 
no real contact of thought between scholar and master, that all 
the questions which are to be asked are to take one particular 
form, and that they all admit of but one answer. There is no 
room for inquisitiveness on the part of the learner, nor for di- 
gression on the part of the teacher, no room for the play of the 
intelligence of either around the subject in hand; the whole 
exercise has been devised to convert a study which ought to awaken intelligence, into a miserable mechanical performance; 
and two people who ought to be in intimate intellectual rela- 
tions with each other, into a brace of impostors—the one teach- 
ing nothing, the other learning nothing, but both acting a part and reciting somebody else’s words out of a book, It is said that there are schools in existence in which Mangnall’s Ques- tions is actually still in use as a task-book to be learned by- heart, and that new editions of it are in constant demand. It is appalling to think of the way in which whole generations of English girls and boys have been stupefied by this book and by others like it, 
It will be seen on further consideration that many of the metaphors we are accustomed to use about Memory are like all

Memory and Intelligence. 137 
  
metaphors when applied to the region of our inner and spirit- 
ual life—a little misleading. To speak of mem- Memory nota 
ory as a receptacle which may be filled, or as a receptacle to 
chain which may draw treasure up from a well, be 
is to imply that memory is a limited power. And this is not 
true. Itis capable of indefinite increase and improvement by 
exercise. Nevertheless, minds which are differently constituted 
will develop in different ways, and when we have subjected 
them all to the same discipline there will remain great diversi- 
ties of result. To some the memory will be specially retentive 
in regard to names and words, to some the recollection of places 
and persons will be easier than that of the names which desig- 
nate them. An unreasoning person may catch up by ear the 
words of a foreign tongue with far greater readiness than one 
whose habits of mind lead him to be always on the watch for 
the laws of language and for illustrations of comparative phi- 
lology. We necd not seck to obliterate these distinctions.’ Even 
a deficiency in the power of carrying a truth in the exact form 
in which we first received it may coexist with the power of re- 
cording that truth by a process of reflection in some other and 
possibly better form. Thucydides and Lord Bolingbroke went 
so far as to complain of the possession of a memory so prodi- 
gious, so indiscriminately tenacious, that it was rather a hin- 
drance than a help to their intellectual activity. ‘‘Some pco- 
ple,” says Archbishop Whately, ‘‘have been intellectually 
damaged by having what is called a good memory. An un- 
skilful teacher is content to put before children all they ought 
to learn, and to take care that they remember it; and so, though 
the memory is retentive, the mind is left in a passive state; and 
men wonder that he who was so quick at learning and remem- 
bering should not be an able man, which is as reasonable as to 
wonder that a cistern, if filled, should not be a perpetual foun- 
tain. Many men are saved by the deficiency of their memory 
from being spoited by their education; for those who have an 
extraordinary memory are driven to supply its place by think- 
ing. If they do not remember a mathematical demonstration
-P-A-G-E-139
138 Learning and Remembering.   
they are driven to devise one, If they do not remember what 
Aristotle or Bacon said, they are driven to consider what they 
are likely to have said, or ought to have said.” 
Thus, while we do well to mark deficiencies in any one par- 
Wh, ticular form of memory among our pupils, and to 
      leseong do oct supply appropriate exercises for removing them, 
rears Serre we may be consoled to remember that there are 
compensations for these deficiencies, It is most 
' undesirable that all minds should conform, or be made to con- 
form, to the same type, and so long as by some process or 
| other—the verbal association or the logical association—the 
mind can be Jed back to the truth once known, and that the 
truth can be so recovered for the purpose for which it is now 
required, we may be well content. Only let us in teaching 
anything always give the impression that it will be wanted 
again. Let us remember that our minds refuse to retain mere 
isolated facts which .are not associated with something which 
we knew before, or which we hope to know hereafter. It is by frequent recapitulation, by recalling the work of other 
lessons, by showing the relation between the past, the present 
and the future stages of learning, that we encourage the student 
to make that effort of attention which is indispensable to re- 
membering. This is why so many of the memory exercises 
which are given in schools are so barren of result. They lead to nothing of which the scholar can see the value.

matics, the moment the student perceives the principle of a 
tule, the process ceases to be mechanical and becomes intelli- 
gent. Here the fruit-bearing stage of the study comes earlier 
than in language, and it may be said that an elementary know- 
ledge in this department, even if it stop short. at the elements, 
is worth something. But if the fruit-bearing stage is not 
reached, if the study is not carried far enough to enable a 
student to receive or express a thought by means of the lan- 
guage, much of the time spent in acquiring the rudiments is 
absolutely wasted. There is nothing in the future life of the 
student to recall to him what he has learned, and much of it 
comes to nothing.

another. What is true in the vegetable world is often true in 
the world of spirit and of thought: ‘Except a corn of whegt 
fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone.” It comes to 
nothing. The condition of its germinating and giving birth to 
something better than itself is that it shall die; and that it shall 
cease to retain the exact shape and character which it had at 
first. It is true that what is hastily acquired is hastily lost.

something else has been built; and it gives to the learner a 
sense of freedom and of elbow-room when in after-life he is 
dealing with it and cognate subjects, such as he could not pos- 
sibly experience if the subject were wholly new tohim. Rules 
serve their purpose if they form our habits of speech or of

action, even though these‘ habits are not consciously obedient to 
the rules, and although the rules themselves could not be re- 
stated in an explicit form. A demonstration in mathematics 
has done its work if, for the time, it gave an insight into the 
true method of reasoning, even though in later life we utterly 
fail to remember the theorem or the proof, So the exact char- 
acter of a set of experimental illustrations in physics may be 
entirely forgotten; yet if the truth they illustrated was by their 
help fastened on the mind, and has subsequently been seen in 
wider and more varied application, we have no right to say 
that the original effort has been wasted. : 
The thoughts and experiences which make up the sum of 
our mental life in different years vary as much as the particles 
that compose the body. Some disappear and others take their 
place. But the life is the same so long as there is continuity 
and health, Personal identity consists, not in sameness of sub- 
stance, but in continuity of life. So the relation of what you 
teach to the permanent thoughts and work of the pupil con- 
sists in its capacity for development into something not itself, 
but akin to itself, better than itself, Here then is one of the tests of our school-lessons. Grant that as school-lessons they 
will be forgotten, Let us reconcile ourselves to this as inevi- 
table, and ask in relation to everything which we teach: ‘Is it germinating and fruit-bearing, or not? When the husk and shell shall have decayed, will there be anything left? If so, what? Will this bit of knowledge drop wholly out of the memory and leave no trace? If so, I will not teach it, though it is in the text-book. Or will it, even though it looks crabbed and un- 
practical, make the perception of some larger and more useful truth easy; will it leave some effect in the form of improved 
taste, truer judgment, or increased power to balance opposing 
facts? If so, I will have it learned, even though I know it will 
be forgotten; and I will feel thankful that there is an art of 
wisely forgetting, as well as one of useful remembering.” 
The main instruments for obtaining knowledge and storing 
the memory are three: oral exposition; self-tuition and reflec

interest; but it_has the disadvantage of making this result 
seem _greater than it is. Then a skilful oral teacher often 
anticipates difficulties, seeks to exemplify and explain every- 
thing, and in this way leaves the scholar too little to do for 
himself. He stimulates attention, but he does not strengthen 
the habit of independent research. Too great reliance on the 
decture system is apt also to lead pupils to reproduce every- 
‘thing which has been taught in the teacher’s own words. 
(Besides, in the desire to make things interesting the teacher is 
fain to indulge in generalizations, in picturesque statements, 
which though true and right as the result of a knowledge of 
data, are extremely pretentious and unreal without such data. 
‘And the effect on a learner’s mind of letting him see the whole

These are dangers inseparably connected with the lecturing 
or expository system. They beset in a special way the most 
earnest and sympathetic teachers. They are to be guarded 
against (1) by the incessant use of oral questions during the 
lesson; (2) by requiring that note-taking during the lesson 
shall be limited to a few significant headings or technical 
words, and shall not reproduce the phrases or sentences of the 
teacher; (8) by causing the substance of the whole lessan to be 
Phought out, and in part written out after the delivery of it is 
finished; (4) and, above all, by taking care to leave something 
substantial for the learner to do, to find out, or to arrange for 
himself.

Tule never to tell them what you could make them tell you; 
never to do for them what they could do for themselves, 
Your teaching is not to supersede books, but rather to lead 
them to the right use of books, You have been studying e.g. 
for a time the history of Edward III,; you want to gather it all 
up, and to give unity to the impression of that particular period 
left on the mind of -the learners. You give therefore a short 
catechetical lecture on the life of Wyclif, whom you select as a 
representative man of the time. But you would not do well 
even to try to make such a lecture exhaustive. Something 
should be left for the pupils to hunt out by themselves, A 
good teacher will say: “I have tried to sketch out the main 
incidents and drift of Wyclif’s life, and I want you in the 
course of next week to write a biography, as complete as you 
can. You will find additional information in Longman’s book, 
and in Chaucer’s Prologue, in Pauli’s Pictures of Old England, 
and in Palgrave’s Merchant and the Friar. Do not think it 
necessary to follow the order I have sketched, or to make the 
same estimate of his character which I have given, if you find 
any facts which seem to tend the other way.” Be sure that if, 
as the result of your teaching, your pupils seem jndisposed to 
read for themselves, if they get the impression that all that 
needs to be known will be told them by yourself, then there is 
a fatal flaw even in the most animated oral lessons, and your 
methods neéd to be revised.

danger of undervaluing set lessons from books. It is the 
worst, or at least the commonplace, the indolent, the unin- 
spired teachers who have a constant tendency to overvalue 
them. AsI have already said, it is the easiest of all forms of 
teaching to set a book lesson, and to say, “‘ Go and prepare it.” 
It is because it is so easy that a good teacher will always exer- 
cise special watchfulness over himself, and ask before setting 
a lesson, ‘‘Is this really the best way of effecting my pur- 
pose?” . 
Before descending to detail and offering rules as to task and 
Ite short- book work, it may be well to go back a long way 
comings. for a few moments, to ask you to consider how 
the relation of written work to intellectual exertion is illustrat 
ed in the Phedrus, one of the dialogues of Plato. Socrates is 
pointing out to one of his disciples how easy it is for a student 
to mistake means for ends, and to make the art of writing 
tather a substitute for mental effort than an aid to it, 
“Er will tell you a story, my dear Pheedrus. Theuth was one of the 
ancient gods of Egypt, who wastthe first to invent arithmetic and geom- etry, and draughts and dice, but especially letters. Now Thamus was at this. time the king of Egypt, and dwelt in the great city of Thebes. ‘To him Theuth went and showed him all the arts which he had devised, and asked hinyto make them known to the rest of the Egyptians, Tha- mus. asked him what was the use of each. But when they came to the letters, ‘This knowledge, © king,’ said the deity, ‘ will make thy people wiser, for I have invented it both asa medicine for memory and for wis- dom.’ But the king answered: ‘Most ingenious Theuth, it is for you to find out cunning inventions, it is for others to judge of their worth and their nobleness,._ But methinks You, out of fondness for your own dis- 
covery, have attributed to it precisely the opposite effect to that which it will have. For this invention will produce forgetfulness on the part of those who use it, since by trusting to writing they will remember out- 
wardly by means of foreigninarks, and not inwardly by means of their 
own faculties. You are providingfor my people the appearance rather 
‘than the reality of wisdom, For they-will think they have got hold of 
something valuable when they only possess themselves of written words, 
and they will deem themselves wise without being so.’ What say you, 
ny Phedrus, did the king speak truly?

“*T think, Socrates, that you can make up stories from Egypt or any 
other country you please, when you want to prove anything.” - 
“Nay, but my dear Pheedrus, consider not where the story comes 
from, but whether it is true. For in the old days men were ready in the 
groves of Dodona, and in other places, to listen to an oak or a stone, pro- 
vided it spoke the truth. And consider furtiter, my Pheedrus, that writ- 
ten discourses have this disadvantage, they seem as if they were alive 
and possessed some wisdom, but if you ask them to explain anything 
they say, they preserve a solemn silence, or give at best but one and the 
selfsame answer. And once written, every discourse is tossed about 
and read alike by those who understand it and by those whom it in no- 
wise concerns, and it knows not to whom to speak, and to whom to be 
silent, But after all, if writing is to be of any service, it must be to re- 
call that which is already known and understood; and unless knowledge 
is shaped and fixed in a learner’s soul, it is of no value at all.” . 
Perhaps this old Greek apologue may not be without a use- 
ful bearing upon the next practical question be Character- 
foreus. ‘‘ What are the conditions on which book- ome exer- 
work and written exercises, especially those done cises. 
out of school are most likely to serve a useful educational pur- 
pose?” 
The first of these conditions ig that the exercises should not

done in two hours. <A good teacher will ask dhe parents to 
inform him if the time devoted to home exercises exceeds this 
limit, and if it proves to do so, the lesson should be. dimin- 
ished in amount. Nor should lessons given to be prepared at 
home be such as require or presuppose intelligent assistance. 
It is not fair for a teacher to relegate much of his. own work 
to the parent. It may be that your pupil is so circumstanced 
that he has no access at home to scholarly help; and in that 
case you impose an unreasonable burden on him, and your | 
task will not be done. And if he has access to such help, the 
beneficent influence of an intelligent home will produce far 
more effect in ordinary intercourse than if father or mother is 
reduced to the réle of a school assistant. Home has its own

let the school exercises encroach too far upon it.

. Think well then before setting them whether you 
have leisure and teaching power enoygh to examine them criti- 
cally. And to this end let an exercise of this kind be as far as 
Possible such as admits of only one way of being right, so-that 
it may be perfectly clear if it is wrong how and why it is 
wrong. Remember that exercises may be very easy to set, but 
very difficult to examine and test. Nothing is easier after a 
lesson than to say, “ Write me to-night an account of what has 
been said to-day.” But when the exercises come in you will 
find that there are a dozen different forms of right and a hun- 
dred ways in which it is possible to be wrong; and that to 
bring the merits and defects clearly before the mind of your 
pupils implies discussion and lengthy personal interviews with 
each child, which, however valuable, take too much time. 
And unless you have the time to spare, do not try it; but keep to lists, names, definitions, facts, of which you can say at once whether they are right or wrong. : They should One great advantage of very definite lessons is ready correc- that they often admit of being expeditiously cor- tion, rected in class, by the method of mutual revision. The exercise books change hands, and each scholar takes a Pencil for the marking of mistakes, while the teacher publicly goes through the questions, causing the answers to be read, and criticising them when they are wrong. After errors have been marked, they are handed back to the original writers, This is not. the only way of correcting exercises, and many occasions arise when more minute personal supervision is needed on the Part of the teacher. But it economizes time, it furnishes the occasion for a most effective form of recapitulatory lesson, and it awakens interest by. putting the scholars into a new attitude of mind—that of critics, Moreover, it is far more effective as a

means of correction than the laborious marking of exercise 
books by the teacher after hours. For such commentaries as 
there is time to write on the margin are necessarily very con- 
cise and incomplete, and not unfrequently remain unread. It 
is obvious however that this plan of mutual correction in class, 
though I believe it might be more largely adopted with 
advantage, presupposes that the exercises are very definite 
in their character, such as memory-work, translation, and 
arithmetic, and is inapplicable to essays or general composi- 
tion. : 
Two distinct objects may be contemplated in the setting of 
home tasks. The one, that the lessons so learned they should 
shall be preparatory, and give the materials for be supple- 
to-morrow’s lesson; the other, that they should be rather 
supplementary, and should havera bearing on the preparatory. 
school-teaching of the previous day. There is an obvious sense 
in which any given lesson may be said to fulfil both purposes. 
Nevertheless, your minds should be clearly made up as to the 
purpose which you think the more important of the two. One 
view on this point is well expressed by Mr. D. R. Fearon in 
his very able and useful work on School Inspection. He says 
of geography and history, that ‘matters of fact should be 
acquired by pupils out of school, in readiness for the lessons. 
It is a deplorable waste of teaching power, and is ruinous both 
to teacher and taught, to let the teacher’s time and vigor be 
spent in telling the children mere rudimentary facts which they 
can gain from a text-book. . . . At Marlborough and Rugby 
the scholars are expected to get up those mere elements out of 
school, and the business of the master is one which presupposes 
in his scholars an acquaintance with such rudiments; it is to 
test, illustrate, amplify and give interest to such presupposed. 
elementary knowledge.” 
Now grant that the distinction here made is a right one, that 
all the interesting and intelligent work has to be done in 
school, and all the drudgery out of it, it is still an open ques. 
tion whether the task of learning names and facts may not be

greatly lightened by coming after rather than before your 
lesson. It is rather hard on a child to expect him to deal thus 
with all the dry boncs, until you come and clothe them with 
flesh and with life. I hold that however judicious this method 
may be in some exceptional cases, it is a safe general rule that 
out of-door exercises should be designed less often to prepare the 
way for a coming lesson than to deepen and fix the memory of 
@ past lesson, Children learn with much more zest and interest 
that of which they can see the bearing and the use than that 
which they are merely told wili have a bearing and a use here- 
after. 
So if I were going to give a lesson on the geography of Swit- 
Illustrative _zerland, I would not require the scholars the day 
examples. —_ before to get up a list of the towns, the cantons, 
or the mountains, But I would give a general oral description, 
would describe by map or model its physical configuration, would 
try to awaken some interest in the hardy, thrifty, liberty-loving 
people who lived in it; and then at the end of the lesson would 
require a map of the country and a few written data about it to 
be prepared as a home lesson. So in arithmetic, I would not, if 
to-morrow’s lesson were to be on reducing fractions to a com- 
mon denominator, say to the scholars, ‘‘ Now to-night you are 
to learn by heart a new rule, and I will explain it and show you 
how to apply it tomorrow.” It is in my judgment a better plan - to begin by taking a problem and working it out inductively on the black-board, to show as you goon the need of each process and its fitness for the end proposed; and then at the end of it to say: ‘‘ What we have thus found iscontained in a rule which 
I want you .to learn and write out, Here also are three ex- amples to be worked in the same manner, which you will do to- night.” So witha new grammatical distinction, say the ablative absolute, I would give an explanation, seek to make. it clear by a few striking examples, and then give out as a home lesson the task (1) of learning the rule or definition by heart—provided it were such a rule or definition as fulfilled the conditions we have already laid down—and @) of finding out in a given page or

chapter as many examples of the ablative absolute as pos- 
sible. 
Tam far from saying that there are no cases in which it is 
good to give out a home exercise in anticipation of to-morrow’s 
work, You want e.g. to have an ode of Horace or a fable 
of La Fontaine preparcd to-morrow. Now if you say to a 
child, ‘Learn this, and be prepared to-morrow with a complete 
translation of it;” and you expect then to find him able to ac- 
count for ali the idioms and allusions, what you are asking is 
somewhat unreasonable. The complete understanding of the 
whole passage is precisely that which your teaching is meant to 
givehim. You must not throw upon him so much Tespon- 
sibility. But it is well to say: “We are going to take to-morrow 
the twelfth ode of the second book, and we shall read it in class 
together. Find out therefore to-night from the dictionary all 
the words you do not already know.” That is a perfectly legi- 
timate requirement. If that is fulfilled, you have some material 
to work with. You read it line by line, you elicit by question- 
ing as much grammar and idiom as is known, you supply the 
new facts, the illustration of new grammatical difficulties, the 
allusions, the significance of the metaphors, the turns of happy 
expression; and then, when you have done this, you say, ‘‘ To- 
night I shall expect you to writemea full and careful translation 
of the whole; and here are a dozen words—proper names, 
idioms, or allusive phrases—which you will underline, and 
on each of which you must write a special comment or ex- 
planation,” 
Thus, you will see, the home or evening work which may 
legitimately be set is partly preparatory and partly supplement- 
ary to your class teaching. But the best part of it issupplement- 
ary. And I have no doubt that, as a general rule, the chief 
value of written exercises is to give definiteness to lessons 
already learned, and to thrust them home into the memory rather 
than to break new ground. Kindle interest and sympathy first,

and then they will be prepared to take some trouble in mastering 
those details which they see to be needed in order to give system 
and clearness to their knowledge. But he who expects children 
to master with any carnestness details of which they do not see 
the purpose, is asking them to make bricks without straw, and 
will certainly be disappointed.

VI. EXAMINING, 
THE whole subject of Examinations looms very large in the 
vision of the public and is apt to be scen out of Examina- 
its true proportions, mainly because it is the one tions. 
portion of school business which is recorded in newspapers. 
We shall perhaps arrive at right notions about it more readily, 
if we first consider the business of examining as wholly sub- 
ordinate to that of education, and as part of the work of a school. 
If we are led to just conclusions on this point, we may then hope 
to consider with profit the effect of the tests and standards ap- 
Plied to school work by outside bodies, by University Ex- 
aminers, or in competitions for the public service. 
First, however, we may be fitly reminded that the art of put- 
ting questions is one of the first and most necessary The art of 
arts to be acquired by a teacher. To know how to putting : * questions. put a good question is to have gone a long way 
towards becoming a skilful and efficient instructor. It is well’ 
“therefore to ask ourselves what are the conditions under which 
catechising can be most effective. 
» , The object of putting questions to a child whom we are in- 
Atructing may be— 
(1) To find out what he knows, by way of preparing him 
for some further instruction. 
(2) To discover his misconceptions and difficulties, 
(8) To secure the activity of his mind and his co-operation 
while you are in the act of teaching him. 
(4) To test the result and outcome of what you have taught. 
So that interrogation is not only a means of discovering what 
is known, it is itself a prime instrument in imparting knowl-

                                      152 Examining.   
edge. In the employment of all our faculties, we want pot 
only the dynamic power, but the guiding sensation to tell us 
what we are doing. Ifa man is deaf, he soon becomes dumb. 
Unless he can hear himself, he ceases to know how to talk, and 
he soon leaves off caring to talk. So as we go on giving a les- son, we are completely in the dark, unless by means of constant 
questioning we keep ourselves en rapport with our pupil, and 
know exaétly whether and how far he is following us, - 
Hence the first object of questioning is to awaken curi- 
‘The ques- osity, to conduct the learner, so to speak, to the Hons of boundaries of his previous knowledge, and thus 
, to put bis mind into the right attitude for ex- 
tending those boundaries by learning something new. And 
we all know that the one person who is generally reputed to be 
the master of this art, and who has in fact given his name to 
one particular form of catechising, was Socrates, Now what 
is the Socratic method of questioning? Socrates was, as you know, a philosopher who lived in the golden age of Greece, 
when intellectual activity in Athens was at its highest point; 
and the function he assigned to himself was a very unique one. He saw around him a people who thirsted for knowledge, and were very fond of speculation. He saw also that there was a 
large class of men, Sophists, Rhetoricians, and others, who sought to satisfy this appetite. And what struck him most . forcibly was the haste with which people generalized about 
things which they had imperfectly examined, the heedlessness 
with which they used certain words before fixing their mean- ing, and generally the need of more self-examination and self- knowledge. Hence it was the chicf purpose of the dialogues which have been handed down to us by his affectionate’ disciples Kenophon and Plato, to clear men’s minds of illusions, and of the impediments to learning; and rather to put them into the best attitude for receiving Knowledge and for making a right use of it, than to give to them definite dogmas, or authoritative statements of truth. I should have been well content if the plan of these lectures had allowed of our devot-

ing one of our meetings exclusively to a consideration of his 
remarkable carcer, and to the effect of his method of teaching 
in awakening inquiry, and in purging and disciplining the 
faculties of his hearers. But it must suffice if I say even to 
those of you who do not read Greek that by devoting a little 
time to the perusal of some of the dialogues as given by 
Whewell or Jowett in their editions of Plato, or toa translation 
of the Memorabilia of Xenophon, or to Mr. Grote’s or Professor 
Maurice’s account of the teaching of Socrates and the Sophists 
of his day, you will acquire some very valuable hints. Mean- 
while I should like to give you one short and free translation 
of a little dialogue from Xenophon which is characteristic of 
his method, 
‘There was a young man named Euthydemus in whom he took much 
interest, and who was fired with a very strong ambition to ‘A Socratic 
distinguish himself as a thinker and a philosopher. So dialogue. 
Socrates placed himself in his way and said: 
“They say, my Euthydemus, that you have collected many of the 
writings of those men whom we call wise: Isit so?” 
“Most undoubtedly it is, and I shall not cease to collect them, for T 
value them very highly. I covet knowledge most of all.” 
“What sort of knowledge do you desire most 7? He then enumerates 
one after another the principal professions—that of a physician, an 
architect, a geometrician, and receives negative answers in each case. 
“ Perhaps then you desire that kind of knowledge which makes the 
able statesman and the good economist, which qualifies for command 
and renders a man useful to himself and others.” 
“ That indeed is what I sigh for and am in search of,” replied Euthy- 
demus with no small emotion. 
Socrates commends this resolve, and by a few more questions elicits 
from his catechumen the declaration that what men want is a stronger 
sense of justice, and that he hopes to be useful in making them under- 
stand their duties better. ‘ Assuredly,” he says in reply to Socrates's 
request for a definition of justice, ‘‘ there can be no practical difficulty 
in pointing out what is just and what is unjust, in actions about which 
Wwe are conversant daily.”” 
“Suppose then,” says Socrates, ‘we draw a line and set down an 
Alpha here and an Omega there, and arrange under these two heads the 
things that belong to justice and injustice respectively.” 
“ You may do so, if you think there will be any use in such a method.” 
“Now” (having done this) “Is there any such @ thing as lying?"
-P-A-G-E-155
154 —- Examining. eee" 
‘* Most certainly.” 
“‘ And on which side shall we place it?” 
“Under Omega, the side of injustice certainly.” 
“Do mankind ever deceive each other?” 
“ Frequently.” - 
‘And where shall we place this deceit?’ 
“On the same side of the line.” 
“Selling people into slavery who were born free?” 
“Still the same certainly." 
“But suppose one whom you have elected to command your armies 
should take a city belonging to your enemies, aud sell its inhabitants 
for slaves. Shall we say he acts unjustly?” 
“By no means,” 
“May we say he acts justly?” 
“We may.” 
“And what if while he is carrying on the war he deceiveth the 
enemy?” . 
“ He will do right by so doing,” 
“May he not likewise, when he ravages their country, carry off their 
corn and their cattle without being guilty of injustice.” 
‘No doubt, Socrates, and when I seemed to say otherwise I thought 
you confined what was spoken to our friends only.” 
“So then, what we have hitherto placed under the letter Omega may be carried over and arranged under Alpha,”” 
“It may.” 
“ But will it not be necessary to make a further distinction, Euthyde- mus, and say that to behave in such a manner to our enemies is just, and to our friends unjust, because to these last the utmost simplicity and candor is due?” 
“You are in the right, Socrates.” 
“ But how, if this general, on seeing the courage of his troops begin to fail, should make them believe fresh succors at hand, and by this means remove their fears; to which side should we assign this false- hood?” 
“*T suppose to justice, 
“ Or, if a child refuseth the physic he stands in need of, and the father deceiveth him under the appearance of food, where shall we place this deceit, Euthydemus?” 
“* With the same, I imagine.” 
“ And, suppose a man in the height of despair should attempt to kill himeelf, and his friend should come and force away his sword, under what head are we to place this act of violence?” “IT should think under the same head asthe former. Itis clearly not wrong.’”* ~
-P-A-G-E-156
Socratic Questioning. 155 
  
“But take care, Euthydemus, since it seemeth from your answers that 
we ought not always to treat our friends with candor and perfect truth- 
fulness, which yet we had before agreed should be done.” 
“Tt is plain we ought not, and I retract my former opinion, if it is al- 
Jowable for me to do so.” 
‘Most assuredly, for it is far better to change our opinion than to per- 
sist ina wrong one. However, that we may pass over nothing without 
duly examining ie, which of the two, Euthydemus, appears to you the 
more unjust, he who deceives his friend willingly, or he who does it 
without having any such design?” 
“By Jove, Socrates, I am not certain what I should answer or what I 
should think, for you have given such a turn to all I have said as to 
make it appear very different from what I thought it. I fancied I was 
no stranger to philosophy, but now it seems to me more difficult, and 
my own knowledge of it less than I supposed.”” 
Now, by some such method, however humbling, it was Soc- 
rates’s desire to bring the mind of a disciple into gocratic 
a fit state for further investigation. To show him estioning. 
that there were latent difficulties in many things which seemed 
very simple; that plausible and well-soundiig general propo- 
sitions admitted of exceptions and qualifications which were 
often unsuspected; and that till these things had been recog- 
nized and carefully examined, it was premature to dogmatize 
about them—all this appeared to him a needful part of intel- 
Jectual discipline. And if, on reading what are called the “ dia- 
logues of search,” you observe that they end in nothing but 
mere negative conclusions, and bring you to no definite state- 
ment of truth; you may bear in mind that though this result 
may seem disappointing, and though it undoubtedly disap- 
pointed his disciples very often, it would not have disappointed

upposing this preliminary work done, you have next to con- 
Tests of 2. sider how questions may be most effectually used 
jon, in the course of lessons and at the end of them. 
The first requisite of a question is that it should be in perfect- 
ly clear, simple language, the meaning of which 
admits of no mistake. It should be expressed in 
as few words as possible. I heard a man questioning a class 
the other day in physical geography. He said: 
“‘ Where do you expect to find lakes? For instance, you know 
the difference between a chain of mountains and a group, don’t 
you. Well, you know the water comes down the side of a 
mountain, and must go somewhere. What is a lake ?” 
Here in this question there are four sentences, and two totally 
different questions. The questioner knew what he wanted, but 
while he was speaking, it dawned upon him that he might make 
it clearer, so he interposed a little explanation, and ended by 
putting a different question from that which he gave at first. 
It was amusing to see the puzzled and bewildered look of the 
children as they listened to this, and to many other of the like 
clumsy and inartistic questions, fenced round by qualifications 
and afterthoughts, until it was very hard for them to know what was really expected of them. In this particular case he 
had got hold of a very true notion, He should first have shown a drawing or a little model of a chain of mountains, and then have asked them to tell him what became of the streams that tolled down into a plain. - Soon he would have elicited a good general notion of the course of rivers as determined by a water- shed. Then he should have asked what would happen if the mountains were not in a chain but in a group, so that when the 1, Clearness,

  water rolled down one side it could not get away, but was 
stopped by another mountain. ‘‘ What becomes of the water?” 
It must stop in the valleys. ‘‘ And when water remains in a 
valley, what do we call it?” A lake. ‘“ Now tell me what a 
lake is.” “‘ How do you expect to find the mountains arranged 
in the lake country. Ina group or ina range? Why?” Each 
question, you see, ought to be one, and indivisible, There 
should be no ambiguity about the sort of answer it requires. 
Let me warn you also to avoid the habit of surrounding your 
questions with little expletives and circumlocu- 
tions. “Can any one tell me?” “ Which of you % Terseness. 
knows?” ‘Will those hold up their hands who can answer?” 
“Well now, I want some child to answer this.” Strip your 
question, as a rule, of all such verbiage and periphrase, and say Plainly what you want. ‘Which are the verbs in that sen- 
tence?” ‘Why is that noun in the ablative case?” ‘How 
many feet are in a mile?” Practise yourself in economizing 
your words, and reducing ail such questions to their simplest 
forms, 
Generally too, all wide, vague inquiries should be avoided. 
“What do you think of that?” “What sort of 
person was Henry VIII.?” ‘‘ Describe what hap- 
pened in the civil war.” ‘‘ What are the uses of iron?” I heard 
a teacher giving a lesson on the atmosphere. He described a 
man drowning, and brought out that he died for want of air. 
“‘Now,” said he in triumph, “ what is the thought that occurs 
to our minds?” Well, Iam sure I could ‘not have answered 
that question; a good many thoughts occurred to my mind, but 
as I had no clear knowledge of the particular thought which 
was in his, and which he expected from his class, I should cer- 
tainly have been silent,—and so were his pupils. Questions of 
this sort, which admit of a good many answers, or of a long 
and comprehensive answer, are perfectly legitimate in a written 
examination, because then there is leisure to answer them fully. 
But they are unsuited to oral questioning, which should always 
be brisk and pointed, and should elicit one fact at a time, 8, Point.

I need not say that there is no questioning here, notwithstand- 
ing the catechetical form of the book from which I take it. 
Little children say ‘‘yes” and ‘‘no” quite mechanically as they 
listen to these admirable sentiments. They know by the very 
tones of your voice what answer you expect; and they can give 
it without in the least degree appropriating the idea conveyed by 
your questions. You may easily test this for yourself; and for 
the present, take my word for it that the power to give a mere 
affirmative or negative answer to your questions may coexist 
with complete ignorance of the whole subject you are professing 
to teach, 
And in a less degree, I would have you distrust all answers 
which consist of single words, You explain by a diagram

or otherwise to little children, what the line is which passes 
through the centre, and you say that it is called 5. Nor capa- 
a diameter. Some teachers would follow up ble of being 
this explanation by saying, ‘‘ What do we call insingle 
this line?” A diameter, ‘What is it?” A diam. Y°"%4® eter. Now the mere echo of the word may readily be given 
you in this way if you repeat the question a dozen times, - 
and given by children who do not know what it means, The 
word diameter is part of a sentence. ‘‘'The line which passes 
through the cenire of a circle or of a sphere is called a diame- 
ter.” And unless the children have appropriated this whole 
Sentence they have learned nothing. So the moment you have 
elicited the word in reply to one question, put a second question 
in another form, ‘‘ What is a diameter?” This will make them 
give you the rest of the sentence. And then afterwards, ‘‘Now 
what have we learned?” ‘That a diameter is, etc.” Let us re- 
member that every answer we get to an ordinary question is a 
fragment of a sentence; that it is only the sentence, and not the 
single word which conveys any meaning; and that the ques- 
tioner who understands his art turns his question round until 
he gets from his scholars successively the other parts of the 
sentence and finally the whole. Indeed one of the best tests of 
a good question is the relation between the number of words 
employed by the teacher and the pupil respectively. If the 
teacher does all the talking, and the pupil only responds with 
single words the questioning is bad. The great object should 
be with the minimum of your own words to draw out the maxi- 
mum of words and of thought from him.

questions, in which the teacher makes an assertion, and then 
stops for the scholar to fill up the last word, are open to the 
same criticism, And as to the practice of suggesting the first 
syllable of a word to some one who cannot recollect it, it is one 
which would never be adopted at all by a skilled questioner. 
In putting a series of questions, whether in the actual course

serve continuity and order. Each question should grow out of 
the last answer, or be in some way logically connected with it. 
Consider the manner in which lawyers who practise at the bat 
employ the art of questioning. You read in the newspapers the 
evidence given at a trial, and are struck with the clearness and 
coherence of the story, especially when you know that it was 
given by an ignorant witness under all the bewildering excite- 
ment of publicity. But in fact, no such story as you read has 
been narrated. The lawyer has clicited fact after fact by a 
series of questions, and the reporter has given you the answers 
only, And the method and clearness, the absence of all irrele- 
vant matter which strike you so much in the evidence, are due 
not to the narrative powers of the witness, but to the skill of the 
barrister who knew exactly what he wanted, and in what order 
the facts should be evolved. Apply this test to your own work 
sometimes. Ask yourself when your scholars close their books 
and you question’ them on a reading lesson, how the series of 
answers would look if taken down by an unseen reporter, and 
printed out in full, Would they be orderly, would they be 
readable? Would they cover the whole ground, and make a 
complete summary of what has been learned? Unless your 
questions would stand this test, you have yet something to learn 
of the teacher’s craft, 
And: with regard to the answers which either you fail to get, ‘The answers, °' Which when you get, you find to be wholly 
wrong, or partly wrong and partly right, a word or two must be said. If the answering is bad, either you have

been asking for what was not known, or for what had heen in- 
sufficiently explained, in which case you should go back and 
teach the subject again. Or there may be knowledge but no 
disposition to answer, in which case your discipline is bad, and 
you must fall back upon some way of recovering it. All ran- 
dom and foolish angwering is rudeness, and should be dealt 
with as such. But the wrong answers which come from 
scholars who want to be right generally require to be met with 
a question differently shaped. Do not leap to the conclusion 
that because your question.is not answered, nothing is known, 
Take your question back, alter its shape, or put a simpler one. 
Perhaps after all, the thing you want to get at is known, but 
the difficulty is in the mere expression of it. You have been 
giving a lesson on the pressure of the atmosphere, and you say, 
“Why is boiling water not so hot on the top of a mountain as 
ina valley?” Now if the class is silent, it may be simply be- 
cause this is a complex question, and a good deal might be said 
in answering it; and your pupil, though knowing something 
about it, does not know exactly where to begin. So you keep 
your question in mind, but for the moment withdraw it. You 
then ask in succession, ‘‘ What happens when water begins to 
boil? What the bubbling means? What would have pre- 
vented the bubbling from beginning so soon? Greater pressure 
of air. What would have caused the bubbling to begin earlier? 
Less pressure. Whether the water is capable of receiving more 
heat after it begins to bubble?” ‘‘ What is the state of the air 
up a mountain as compared with that below?” and so forth; 
and to all of these detailed questions you will probably get 
answers. And having got them, it may be well then to go back 
and to say, “I asked you at first a hard question including all 
these particulars. - Which of you can now give me a complete 
answer to that first question?” Do not be impatient, and hasten 
to answer your own questions, which of course is often the 
easiest thing to do. It is in the very act of drawing out the 
knowledge and thought of the scholars, and piecing it together, 
that you are bringing their intelligence into discipline. You

have to show them that much of what you want them to know 
they may find in themselves, and that you can help them to find 
it. And you can only do this by cultivating very great variety 
in the form in which you put your questions, and by practising 
ahe art of resolving all complex questions which prove too dif. 
ficult into a series of simple ones. When a good teacher re- 
‘veives a clumsy answer, which is partly wrong and partly right, 
or which though right in substance is wrong in form, he does 
not reject it; but either he accepts it as partially true and stops, 
and after obtaining a better answer from another scholar, goes 
back, and asks the first to amend his answer: or else he sees 
that the full investigation of the difficulty thus revealed would 
carry him too far from the main purpose of the lesson and spoil 
its unity. In this case he reserves the point, so to speak, says 
it wants further examination, and promises either at the end of 
the lesson, or very soon in a new one, to go into the matter and 
clear the difficulty away. Never treat an honest dilemma or 
confusion as a fault, but always as something which you would 
like to solve, and in the solving of which you mean to ask for 
the pupil’s co-operation, 
There are those who in questioning, especially when the class 
Collective is large, are content to receive replies from such 
aeons scholars as, by holding up their hands or otherwise, 
. volunteer to answer. This is of course easy, but it is very unsatisfactory. Every scholar should know that he is liable to receive a question, and that the more careless and 
. indifferent he seems, the more liable he will be to be chal- lenged. Fasten your eye on the worst scholar in your class and be sure to carry him with you; and measure your progress by what you can do with him. The eagerness of a teacher who is so impatient of delay that he welcomes any answer he can, get, and pushes on at once is somewhat ensnaring to him. We must avoid mistaking the readiness of a few clever chil- dren, who are prominent in answering, for the intellectual Movement of the whole class. If you find yourself in the least danger of thus mistaking a part for the whole, put your ques-,

tions to the scholars in turns now and then. It may perhaps 
help to remove an illusion. Or notice the scholars who fail 
oftenest, and bring them into the desk nearest you, and take 
care that they have twice as many questions as any one else. 
The art of putting a good question is itself a mental exercise 
of some value, and implies some knowledge of mutual 
the subject in hand. You are conscious of this questioning. 
when you yourselves interrogate your class. Bear this in 
mind, therefore, in its application to the scholars. Let them 
occasionally change their attitude of mind from that of re- 
ceivers and respondents, to that of inquirers. Remember 
Bacon’s aphorism, Prudens questio, dimidium scientia. You 
are half-way to the knowledge of a thing, when you can put a 
sensible question upon it. So I have sometimes heard a teacher 
towards the end of a lesson appeal to his pupils, and say to 
them one by one, ‘ Put a question to the class on what we have 
learned!” To do this, a boy must turn the subject round in 
his mind a little and look at it in a new light. The knowledge 
that he is likely to be challenged to do it will make him listen 
to the lesson more carefully, and prepare himself with suitable 
questions; and whether he knows the answer or not, there is a 
clear gain in such an effort. The best teachers always.encour:. 
age their scholars to ask questions. The old discipline in the 
Medieval Universities of posers and disputations, in which one 
student proposed a thesis or a question, and another had to an- 
swer it, was not a bad instrument for sharpening the wits, In 
a modified way, it may be well to keep this in view, and to set 
scholars occasionally to question one another. 
Mr. Bain has said, ‘“‘ Much of the curiosity of children is a 
spurious article. Frequently it is a mere display The inquisi- 
of egotism, the delight in giving trouble, in being “ve spit. 
pandered to and served. Questions are put, not from the 
desire of rational information, but for the love of excite- 
ment.” And later on, he says that ‘The so-called curiosity 
of children is chiefly valuable as yielding ludicrous situations 
for our comic literature.” We have thus, on very high au-
-P-A-G-E-165

  thority, a reproof for childish inquisitiveness, and an apology 
for ignorant nurses, and for fainéants and unsympathetic 
teachers in the use of the familiar formula, ‘‘ Don’t be tiresome 
snd don’t ask questions.” One might have hoped that this 
was one of the modes of treating children which was becoming 
obsolete, and that the teachers of the future would at least try 
to regard the curious and inquiring spirit among children, as 
one of the most hopeful of signs; one of the principal things to 
be encouraged in early training; one of their surest allies in the 
later development of thought. ‘For Curiosity,” Archbishop 
Whately says, ‘‘is the parent of attention, and a teacher has 
no more right to expect success in teaching those who have no 
curiosity to learn than a husbandman has who sows a field 
without ploughing it.” I doubt whether any one of us can 
establish for himself a satisfactory code of rules, or a workable 
theory of discipline, until he shall at least have made up his 
mind on the point thus raised. Is the childish curiosity a thing 
to be repressed as an impertinence and a nuisance, or to be en- 
couraged and welcomed as the teacher’s best auxiliary? Is the 
habit of putting questions on what a child does not understand 
—f saying when a hard word occurs—‘‘If you please will 
you explain that to me, J want to know’—a good habit or a 
bad one? For my part, although I am quite aware that as a 
matter of discipline, mere impudence and forwardness—the 
putting of questions for the sake of giving trouble to teachers— 
ought to be sternly discountenanced when they occur, it seems 
to me nevertheless true that for every time in which they occur, 
there are ten times in which the question of a child evinces real 
mental activity and a desire to know. 
It seems right to revert for a moment to the printed ques- 
Catect tions, such as are often found appended to school- 
“books; and to the use of Catechisms. The an- 
swers when learned by heart are open to the objections I have 
already urged: (1) That the language in which they are ex- 
  i | pressed has seldom or never any special value of its own to 
||| Justify its being committed to memory at all; and (2) That
-P-A-G-E-166
Catechisms. 165 
  
even when learned by heart and remembered the sentences are 
generally incomplete; for since part of the sentence lies in the 
question which is not learned by heart; the other part or the 
answer is a mere fragment, and is of little or mo use; and (3) 
They assume that every question admits of but one form of 
answer; which is scarcely true of one question in a hundred. 
But the worst effect of the use of printed catechisms is that pro- 
duced upon the teacher. So far from encouraging or helping 
him in the practice of questioning, the use of the book has 
precisely the opposite effect. I wish to speak with all respect 
of catechisms, some of which such as the Church Catechism 
and the Shorter Catechism of the General Assembly are con- 
nected with the history of religion in this country, in a way 
which entitles them, at least so far as their substance is con- 
cerned, to veneration. Moreover for parents and for clergy- 
men, and others who are not teachers by profession, it may 
often be useful to see what is the sort of knowledge which 
should be imparted to children, and in what order the parts of 
it should be arranged. But nobody who has the most elemen- 
tary knowledge of the teacher’s art would ever degrade himself 
by using a catechism, and causing the answers to be learned 
by heart. I remember with what pious care J was taught the 
Church Catechism in childhood, and how many hundred times 
1 have recited that formulary, I remember too that there was 
one question ‘‘ What did your godfathers and godmothers then 
for you?” in which I always thought that then was a verb. 
But I never asked. It seemed, though a strange expression, to 
fit in well with the generally quaint and antiquated character 
of the rest, And to the best of my recollection, this question 
was never once turned round, and translated into a form in 
which it was more intelligible to me. Even the worst of my 
teachers would, if the responsibility of framing the question 
had been left to him, have been compelled to ask such a ques- 
tion as I could understand. But the fact that the authorized 
question was printed in a book released him from this respon- 
sibility. He regarded the Church’s words when learned by

heart as a sort of charm, possessing a value quite independent 
of any meaning they might actually convey; and the result was 
that though the lesson was called a catechism, there was no 
true catechising, and that instead of an exercise which should 
appeal to the intelligence and the conscience, there was a barren 
ceremony, which made no impression on either, And what is 
true of religion is true of all other subjects. I never once found 
in examining a school, that a, subject—be it astronomy, history, 
geography or heathen mythclogy—which had been taught by 
means of a catechism had been properly understood by the 
learners. 
A similar objection though in a less degree attaches to books 
Books in the 0% Science or history in which an attempt is made 
gonversa to gild the pill by casting the treatise into a con- 
versational form. In such books a good boy and 
girl are often made to evince a shrewdness and a thirst for 
knowledge, which to say the least are remarkable, to play into 
the teacher’s hands, to ask precisely the questions he wishes to 
answer, and to start only those problems and difficulties. which. 
he is specially prepared to solve. There is an unreality about 
all this which children detect even more readily than their 
elders, and which causes them as a rule to feel some distrust

adopt on its own merits, whether the pupil is likely to be ex-

Now, what is it that a judicious examination in writing does

It teaches method, promptitude, self-reliance. It demands ac- 
curacy and fulness of memory, concentrated attention, and the 
power to shape and arrange our thoughts. ‘‘ Moreover,” as 
Mr. Latham well observes, ‘‘ behind all these qualities lies 
something which a mental physiologist would call massiveness 
or robustness of brain, or which we call energy of mind. Of 
this, so far as it is brought out in dealing with books or ideas, 
we can judge fairly from a written examination. We@ce that 
knowledge has been got, and know that brain-work has been 
done to get it, and in addition we note indications of strength 
or feebleness of will; we can find out pretty well from a set of 
papers whether a man knows his own mind or not.” Written 
work will call out qualities which could not be revealed by 
vied voce questions. The oral examination is good for intellect- 
ual stimulus, for bracing up the student to rapid and prompt 
action; for deftness and brightness. But oral answers are nec- 
essarily discontinuous and fragmentary. The pupil receives 
help and suggestion at every moment from the play of the 
teacher’s countenance, from the answers given by his fellows. 
Whatever of unity and sequence there is in the treatment of the 
subject is the teacher’s work, not the pupil’s; and until you 
subject him to the test of writing, you have no security that he 
has grasped the subject as a whole, or that he is master of the 
links that bind one part of that subject to another. 
Nevertheless we have to postulate here that there are certain 
very valuable qualities which are not revealed what they

  power. They do not tell you whether the action of mind has 
been rapid or sluggish, nor how far the pupil has been influ- 
enced by a sense of duty or by strong interest in his work. 
Still less do they help you to gauge those attributes on which 
success and honor in life so much depend; sympathy with hu- 
man beings, deference for superiors, the power of working with 
and influencing others; address, flexibility, manner. Let us 
once for all acknowledge that cither for educational purposes, 
or for testing and selection, with a view to the requirements of 
a University or of the public service; the best examinations do 
not test the whole man, but leave some important elements of 
character to be ascertained by other means; and we have still 
to ask, within what limits examinations are valuable, and how 
we cany the maximum of good out of them. . If we get at 
wrong results by trusting to examinations, it-is not hecaiseex 
_ aminations are misleading or inequitable, but because we use 
them t¥o exclusively, and do not also make a due use of other 
means of judging. 
Tt often happens that pupils who present themselves for some 
public examination for the first time are hindered by flurry and 
nervousness from doing themselves justice. But this is because 
the conditions of the examination, the silence, the printed paper, 
the isolation, the utter impossibility of getting a friendly hint, 
or word of encouragement, or any assurance that they are in 
the right way, are entirely new to them. But these conditions 
ought not to be new, for they are in themselves a discipline in 
self-possession and self-mastery. ; We do well therefore to ac- 
cept them, not as a grievance, but as having a value of their 
own; and if our pupils are looking forward to any public ex- 
amination, to make that examination subservient to our pur- 
poses as teachers, not to allow ourselves to be dominated by it. 
In making up our minds on this subject we must beware of 
False meta. being misled by false metaphors. We are told 
phors. sometimes that the habit of probing children often, 
either by written or oral examinations, is like digging up the 
Toot of a flower to see how it grows, and those who talk thus

say much as to the value of stillness and meditation, and the 
importance of leaving scope for silent growth, and for the 
natural action of the child’s own mental powers. But there is 
no true analogy here. The act of reproducing what we know, 
and giving it new forms of expression, is not an act of loosen- 
ing, but of fixing. We must of course abstain from needless 
and irritating questions, but we may not forget that with a 
child, to leave him unquestioned and untested is not to give 
better room for the spontaneous exercise of his own faculties, 
but simply to encourage stagnation and forgetfulness. 
There is another still more unpleasant metaphor often used in 
connection with the subject of examinations. They Cram, . 
are said to encourage crum; and this word has . 
come to be currently used as a convenient term to des* Sate any 
form of educational work which the speaker may happen to 
dislike or wish to discredit. But we should try to clear our 
minds of illusions on this point. If by this term we mean dis- 
honest preparation, hasty and crude study, a contrivance by 
which persons may be made to seem to know more than they 
actually understand; we are all alike interested in denouncing 
it. But it is not necessarily encouraged by examinations. On 
the contrary, this is precisely what every good examination is 
meant to detect. And every examiner who knows his business 
can easily discern the difference between the knowledge which 
is genuine and has been well digested, and that which is super- 
ficial and-is specially got up to déceive him. Dishonestly pre- 
pared men undoubtedly come up for examinations, but they do 
not pass, and the blame of the transaction rests with those who 
send them up, not with the examinations themselves. 
It is plain that this ugly term cannot properly apply to read- 
ing, writing, and arithmetic. A child can either perform these 
acts or he cannot; whether he can perform them or not is ascer- 
tainable by a simple test, and if he can perform them well he 
has acquired an accomplishment of permanent value. Hemay 
have been unskilfully taught, or taught by too slow a process, 
but he cannot have been “crammed” or dishonestly taught,
-P-A-G-E-171

What is implied by the use of this term is often that the work 
which has been done is of the wrong sort, that it has been done 
in an excited eager way, and with too great a consciousness of 
the imminence of the examination, It is your business to watch 
any tendency in this direction and to guard against it. 
Here, however, it is to be noted, that if the scholar is per- 
mitted to attempt in two months, work which ought to occupy 
a year, it is the ten months’ slackness, and not the two months’ 
exceptional effort, which constitutes the evil. Even this is an 
evil which it is easy to exaggerate. It is good for us all through 
life to have in reserve the power of putting Special energy into 
our work at particular emergencies, Such emergencies occur 
occasionally in after years when we do not think of effort; when 
we wiltingly ‘‘scorn delights and live laborious days,” and 
when the whole faculty and strength are concentrated on the 
solution of one practical problem, or the achievement of one 
object of strong desire. So long as the health does not suffer 
we do not object to see a boy’s power strained and concentrated 
on a cricket-match, or a girl’s on some decoration or festival, 
although we know that the effort is excessive, and could not 
properly be continued, Nature is very kind to young people, 
and restores their energies to their proper balance very soon; 
and she will do it we may be sure quite as readily with the in- 
tellectual as well as with the physical powers, For one au- 
thentic case of permanent injury to the health of a school-boy 
or girl from too much mental exercise, there are twenty ex- 
amples of scholars who suffer from idleness or inaction. 
But grant that special pressure of this kind is an unmixed 
evil; it might easily be avoided in your school 
aaa figns _ work if you will bear in mind two or three simple abuse of ex- a amination, Precautions: 
(1) Do not undertake to prepare the pupils of 
your school for more than one external examination, and 
make sure that the scheme selected corresponds to your own 
aim and ideal of school-work. 
(2) Having selected it, look its requirements well in the face
-P-A-G-E-172
Legitimate Preparation. 171 
a good year beforehand, arrange all your work so that a small 
but distinct approach shall be made towards your end every 
day. Refuse to allow any pupil to present himself unless ha 
has had time and opportunity to do his work well. 
(8) Do not let any part of the preparation be considered ex- 
ceptional, but incorporate the whole of it as far as possible inte 
the daily programme of the school. 
(4) If you have a few pupils going up for the Oxford or the 
Cambridge Local Examinations, or any other which offers a con- 
siderable varicty of alternative subjects, select for them all the 
one or two of such subjects which, having regard to your own 
tastes and to the qualifications of your teaching staff, you feel 
to be most appropriate. Do not cut up the organization of the 
school and waste your own teaching power by letting the pupils 
choose their own alternatives, Of course it is a good thing to 
consider the individual bent of each child and to encourage it. 
But you cannot do this wisely in the matter of examinations 
except where the pupils have access to private tuition. The in- 
terests of every pupil in a school are best consulted in the long- 
run by his learning that which others are learning, and which 
the school can teach best. 
(5) It is a good plan to hold a fortnightly or monthly ex- 
amination in writing, extending over the principal subjects to 
be taught, and conducted under the same conditions of silence 
and complete isolation which are observed in public examina- 
tions. Besides this, it is well much more frequently to give, in 
connection with each subject, a single question, to be answered 
fully in writing. The teacher should read some of the answers 
aloud, and point out their several defects, and then invite his 
class to watch him while he gives a model answer, as complete 
as he can make it, both as regards matter and style. 
For school purposes it is well often to use a form of examina- 
tion which would be impossible in public competitions, viz., to 
give more time and to allow the use of books. After all, some 
of the best efforts we make in after life are made under these 
conditions, and the art of using authorities and of referring ta

them, is one which a school ought to teach. Some subjects 
lend themselves better to this form of exercise than others, e.g. 
biography, the description of a country, the explanation of the 
theory of a mathematical rule, the preparation of an essay on 
some familiar subject of fact or moral speculation, Here you 
do not want to test memory, but the power of using all the 
resources at one’s disposal—books as well as thought. So a 
teacher may wisely say now and then, ‘‘Here is a question 
which wants a little thinking, I will give you two days to 
answer it, and you may get the answer where and how you 
like.” 
In drawing up a paper of questions, or determining how 
Preparation ™any you should set, you will be guided by cir- 
of written cumstances. If you have to examine a number of 
questions. persons not your own pupils, it is always well to 
give more questions than can be answered, and to require the 
student to choose a limited number of those he can answer best. 
In the India Civil Service, where the competition is absolutely 
open, and where it is the business of the examiners to do full 
justice to men who have different tastes, and have been very 
differently taught, I have been accustomed to set a long paper, 
say of 20 questions, and require that no candidate shall take 
more than six. We thus give a wide range of choice, and at the same time forbid a man to attempt a good many questions, 
and so to accumulate marks by superficial knowledge. At the University of London, where the curriculum of instruction is 
more strictly defined, but where the candidates have been taught on very different systems, it is usual at Matriculation to set in most subjects about 15 questions, and to limit the scholar to ten. But in a school where the teacher is himself the ex. aminer, and where he knows exactly what has been taught ana what ought to be known, it is not desirable to offer any choice or to set more questions than can be answered easily in the time. It is he, not the pupil, who should choose the questions which have to be answered. 
Asa rule, it is not desirable to sit down 1o frame a paper of
-P-A-G-E-174
Vicious Forms of Question. 178 
  
questions all at once, If the examiner relies on his memory, 
or general knowledge of the subject, his questions will have a 
sort of family likeness, will deal with what his pupils know to 
be his special fancics, and so will probably be anticipated. 
And if he sits down to prepare a paper by the help of a text- 
book, he is tempted to select such questions as turn on obscure 
or isolated details, matters easy to question on, but of little real 
value. So he should usually have his note-book with him, and 
from time to time, as experience in teaching suggests to him 
some good form of question, he should jot it down, so as to 
have a store of such questions ready for use when they are 
wanted. You are much more likely to adapt your questions 
to the actual knowledge of the scholars if you do this, than if 
you attempt to recall the whole subject at once. 
The first requisite of a good paper is that it shall be clear 
and unmistakable in its meaning. All obscurity, post of a 
all pit-falis, and all ambiguity should be avoided, good paper 
for they defeat their own purpose. of questions, 
The next thing necessary is that the paper should be per- 
fectly fair, i.e. exactly adapted to the scholar’s age and attain- 
ments; and to what he may reasonably be expected todo. The 
moment you allow yourself to think of the effect that your 
questions will have on parents or on the outside public, you 
are in danger of proving unfair to the scholars, The object of 
the paper is to draw out their knowledge, not to detect their 
ignorance. You want to encourage them to do their best with 
the materials they have, and there is a want of perfect candor 
towards them, when you present them with a paper which you 
have drawn rather to display your own knowledge than theirs, 
and rather to impress other people with the width and excel- 
lence of your curriculum than to correspond to any reasonable 
requirements you can make of your pupils. I knew a large 
private school in Yorkshire, the principal of which used his - 
last paper of examination questions as & printed advertisement, 
which was exhibited at railway stations and in newspapers, 
together with a prospectus of the school, and a highly idealized

wood-cut representing that establishment, though a mean one, 
as one of palatial elevation and park-like surroundings. I need 
not say that the questions were of a very formidable kind, and 
were calculated to astonish and impress ignorant people. But 
what the boys thought of them, how they had answered them, 
and what sort of moral influence a master could hope to gain 
over children whom he caused to be parties to an imposture, 
the outside public were not informed, though I think some of 
-us can guess. 
Then a good proportion of the questions in every paper should

forward- forward questions in a familiar form, such as the 
BESS. average scholar, who has merely been diligent, 
Sut who has no genius, and not much talent for composition, 
may feel encouraged to answer. Simple questions are always 
best; for they help you to do full justice to commonplace 
pupils, and yet there is scope enough in them for difference in 
the manner and substance of the answer, to distinguish be- 
tween such pupils and the best. Still, over and above these 
simple questions, I should always put two or three which require 
a little thought to interpret, and which will afford opportuni- 
ties to the best scholars to distinguish themselves, Say I draw 
a paper of ten questions on Arithmetic. I would let seven of 
them be honest, straightforward sums in the form which the 
scholar would naturally expect; but I would add three which 
required an explanation of principles, and which, without 
being puzzles or conundrums, were designed to call forth the 
ingenuity and thought of the best scholars. Every paper you 
set has, it must be remembered, an educational value over and 
above its office as a mere test. It is liable to be referred to and 
read again, and it helps to set up among your scholars the ideal 
at which you are aiming. So let us bear in mind that a good 
examination, when it has fulfilled its first duty as an honest scrutiny of what the pupils ought to have learned already, has 
also to fulfil the secorid purpose of showing what you think they

ought to aim at, and in what way you wish their own thoughts 
to be brought to bear upon their work. 
There is a kind of examining which has a sad tendency to 
beget untruthfulness on the part of both teachers and scholars; 
I mean that in which young or immature students are encour- 
aged to use language which they do not understand, and which 
presupposes a speculative and philosophic power which they 
do not yet possess, 
Let me read to you some questions lately set at a public insti- 
tution to some young people who had been attending a course” 
of lectures: 
“What is General History, and how is a scientific treatment of this 
subject possible? 
‘What are the fundamental principles of the Chinese political and 
social organization? 
‘What do the Vedas contain? How do you account for the develop- 
ment of Brahmanism in India, and what are the analogies between the 
Indian, Egyptian, and Greek mythologies? 
‘Who were the Persians? Sketch their mythical period, and give the 
principal incidents of their history, and the causes of their decline. 
Who were the Greeks, and what was their influence on the intellectual 
development of humanity? 
Give the principal laws of Lycurgus and Solon, their analogies and differences, and describe their influence on the formation of the Greek 
character, 
Name the most important philosophical schools of Greece. 
What were the chief causes that led to the establishment of the 
Empire at Rome? 
What were the principal causes of the rapid progress of Christianity 
from an historical point of view?” 
I have seen some of the answers to these questions, in which 
there are no facts, but much vague talk about the philosophic 
teaching of Thales and Anaximander, and about the static and 
dynamic forces of humanity, The pretentiousness and false- 
hood of all this will be apparent to you at once. Here are 
questions which the most accomplished scholars could not an- 
swer without effort, placed in the bands of raw beginners, who

are thus tempted to indulge in philosophic generalization while 
profoundly igrorant of the data on which all such generaliza- 
tion ought to rest.

The esti tions in view of the actual knowledge, both of the stima- 
tion of writ- ordinary scholar, and of the best who want an op- 
ten answers, portunity of distinguishing themselves; it then be- 
comes necessary to estimate the answers. On the whole, the 
ordinary arithmetical test is the fairest and the least liable to 
error. You determine on a maximum, say 100, to represent 
the highest attainable excellence. You then assign a due propor- 
tion of marks to each question according to its difficulty. It is : 
a good plan to distribute about 90 in this way, reserving the last 
ten forstyle, neatnessand finish, and general skill of arrangement. 
In distributing your 90 marks among, say, ten questions, you will 
give perhaps 12 to one, and 6 to another, according to the amount 
of knowledge and intelligence required to produce a perfect 
answer. But I would not tell the scholars which questions car-~ 
ried most marks, It is not good that they should be speculat- 
ing and inquiring what are the relative values of different an- 
swers in your mind. It is enough to tell them to select those 
questions which they can answer best; and you will judge, if 
one fastens on the purely memory work, while another chooses 
to give the best of his time to those questions which require 
some thought and originality to answer them, how such an- 
swerts ought to be estimated. 
As you read ‘each answer in turn, you should set down the 
How to read Proportion of the maximum number assigned to Remain that particular question which the answer de- 
“serves. It is essential that this should be done with each question, and that there should be no room left for caprice or hasty impression by attempting to mark the value of the paper as a whole. Nevertheless, before passing on to an- other paper, and while your recollections are perfectly fresh, it is well to add up the result and see if the total appears to repre- 
sent fairly the general merit of the paper considered as a whole,
-P-A-G-E-178

For it may be that the scholar though evidently writing from 
a full mind, has mismanaged his time, has given needlessly ela- 
borate answers, say to four questions, for which he has the 
maximum marks, and yet has a smaller total than an inferior 
scholar who has attempted eight questions, and has scored a 
fair number for each. This should be set right at once by the 
addition of a few marks for general ability. It is not safe, or 
really equitable, to leave the total of each scholar’s marks to be 
added up afterwards. 
In mathematics it is not difficult for a student, by doing all 
the exercises right, both in method and result, to obtain the full 
number of marks. But in other subjects the maximum will 
rarely or ever be attained, as it will represent in the examiner’s 
mind the highest conceivable standard of excellence, and it is 
very unlikely that this will be attained in every one of a num- 
ber of questions in History or Literature. So in most subjects 
I should regard as a good paper that which obtained three quar- 
ters, and as a fair or passable paper that which received half 
of the marks, 
Great care should be taken to keep your own judgment equi- 
tably balanced while you are reading. So before marking any, 
it is well to read over several papers, choosing, if you have any 
sort of clew, one or two likely to be good, and one or two likely 
to be indifferent, and so fix the standard of what it is reasonable 
to expect. With this standard in your mind it will be fair to 
begin marking the answers one by one. If you are examining 
for any prize or competition, it is needful to give the papers a 
second reading, comparing not only paper with paper, but an- 
swer with answer. ‘For ordinary pass examinations this is not 
necessary. 
It is sometimes asked whether negative marks should ever be 
given, or marks deducted for ignorance, That Negative 
depends on the kind of ignorance. Mere ab- marks, 
sence of knowledge ought not to be counted as a fault, other- 
wise than as depriving the pupil of the marks which would 
have been due to knowledge. It ought not, I think, to be 
12
-P-A-G-E-179
  178 Examining.   
punished by the subtraction of marks to which other knowl- 
edge would entitle him. But the sort of pretentious ignor- ance which makes blunders and mistakes them for knowledge, 
which indulges in grand, sonorous and vague statements care- 
fully constructed to conceal the lack of true information, ought 
to be punished as a fault. A bad and inflated style, false spell- 
ing, the use of words which are not understood, may-not unrea- 
sonably be visited with the forfeiture of marks to which the 
mere Memory work would be entitled, But you must make 
allowance for.a few very innocent blunders, such as will be 
inevitable among young people who are being put to this sort 
of test without much previous practice. When a scholar tells 
you that ‘‘we derive a good deal of our early, knowledge of 
English History from an ancient chronicler named Adam 
Bede,” that ‘Buckingham was at first a friend of Dryden, 
but that he afterwards became one of his contemporaries,” or 
that “Sir Wm. Temple was a statesman in the time of Charles 
II. who had a hand in the Triple Alliance, and who in later life acquired some odium by writing Essays and Reviews,” you 
Venialand  ‘™ay set it down as mere bewilderment, which does 
nishable not mean ignorance, which would be corrected by 
° a moment's thought, and should therefore not be 
counted as a fault. On the other hand, a blunder such as that of a man who, in commenting on the passage in Milton refer- ring to “our sage and serious poet Spenser” as “‘a better moral- ist than Scotus or Aquinas,” said that these worthies ‘were ‘two licentious poets of the period;” or that of the student who said that “John Locke was a poet who was knighted by Queen Elizabeth,” or that of him who wrote that “the Americans 
were so grateful for the services of George Washington that 
they made him a peer,” ought to be reckoned as a fault to be 
punished, because in each case it is a mere guess, put out 
rather dishonestly with the chance of its being right or with 
the deliberate intention of practising on the possible ignorance 
or carelessness of the examiner. 
Even in class work, the course of oral questioning may some-

times be advantageously interrupted, by requiring the answer 
to be given by all the students immediately in writing instead 
of word of mouth. If you want to know whether all the class 
knows a French verb, or a number of dates, or a group of 
names, this is an expeditious and very thorough method. ‘And 
here, when you have examined the note-books by the plan of 
mutual correction or otherwise, the result may well be tabulated 
in a numerical form, But in ordinary oral questioning of a 
class and estimating its result, Ido not think it is quite pos- 
sible to adopt the arithmetical mode of measurement with per- 
fect exactness, and therefore I would not use it at all, but em- 
ploy other symbols such as Hecellent, Good, Fair, Moderate, 
which are better fitted to describe general impressions. 
’ 
And yet now the most important thing remains to be said. 
This whole problem of examinations and the right no morality 
way of conducting them and preparing for them of examina- 
touches very nearly the morality of the school life. tions. 
Look well to the influence which the examinations you use are 
having on the ideal of work and duty which your scholar is 
forming. Ask yourself often if that which will enable him to 
do best in examination is also that which is best for him to learn. 
‘Watch how the prospect of the examination tells upon his meth- 
ods of study, his sense of honor, his love of truth. Determine 
that whatever happens, you will not pay too heavy a price for 
success in examinations. Discountenance resolutely all tricks, 
all special study of past papers, and of the idiosyncrasies of 
examiners, and all speculations as to what it will and what 
it will not “pay” to learn. It is because sufficient ‘regard is not 
paid to these considerations, that many thoughtful persons now 
are fain to denounce examinations altogether, as the bane of all 
true learning, and as utterly antagonistic to the highest aims of 
ateacher. There ought however to be no such antagonism. 
In their proper place, examinations have done great service to 
education, and are capable of doing yet more. But they can 
only do this on one condition, Let us make sure that for us,
-P-A-G-E-181

and for our pupils, success in examinations shall not be regarded as an end, but as a means towards the higher end of real cul- ture, self-knowledge and thoughtfulness. And let us Keep in mind for them and for ourselves the old sound maxim: “Take care of everything but the examination, and let the examina, tion take care of itself.” :

  VII. PREPARATORY TRAINING.

Wwe want to have at our disposal faculties which have been dis- 
ciplined and brought into active and systematic exercise; and 
it would be well if we could presuppose that all this discipline 
has been obtained in the preparatory school. But there are two 
very good reasons why teachers in Grammar schools or public 
schools should try to form clear notions about elementary and 
even infant training. First, because that training is often in- 
complete, and needs to be prolonged into an advanced course. 
It is not a creditable thing that the simple arts of 
good reading, spelling, and legible writing, should the attention’ 
be so despised and disregarded that youths who of all school- 
have been at public schools are often inferict in 
these respects to the children of National Schools. Year by 
year, many young men who come up to be examined for com- 
missions in the army, and in the higherdepartments of the 
Civil Service—young men who are presumed to have had a 
liberal education, are rejected for bad spelling; and their writ- 
ing, as I, an old examiner, have good reason to know, is almost 
ostentatiously slovenly and illegible; the scribble of men whe 
think good writing a thing for clerks and shopmen, and beneath 
the consideration of gentlemen. One reason therefore for ask- 
ing your attention to these elementary matters is because pro- 
vision ought to be more systematically made in higher schools 
for teaching them properly, if the preparatory school has failed 
to do it; and in cases where the preparatory training has been 
 
-P-A-G-E-183
182 Preparatory Training. 
  
good, care should at least be taken to see that the lessons shall 
not be lost, but that the higher course shall strengthen rather 
than destroy the neat and accurate habits which have been once 
acquired, 
Another reason why I hope you will not think these simple 
matters are beneath your attention is that even the highest class 
of teachers are often called on to organize and superintend pre- 
paratory departments; or at least to test their work and see that 
they fulfil their proper purpose. They should therefore make 
up their own minds as to what is the difference between good 
and bad early training, and how to discern that difference. 
They are called on, if not to be the educators of very young 
children, atleast to be the critics and guides of those who un- 
dertake this work. They suffer if the preparatory training has 
been unskilful; and they should be ready when occasion arises 
to point out to the teachers in preparatory schools, how their 
work ought to be done. . Now it would be beyond my proper province to attempt 
ples to here an analysis of the parts respectively to. be 
be kept a ‘ played by the senses and the intellect in the 
discipline, development of a child, That the way to the un- 
. derstanding is through the senses; that in early childhood the senses are more active than the intelligence, and 
that the first teaching should therefore be addressed. to the eye and the ear rather than to the reflective powers, are truisms, on 
which we need not dwell. The processes by which sensation leads the way to knowledge, and knowledge to inference and 
reasoning, are some of the most fertile subjects of inquiry, and will be duly brought before you by my successor, as parts of mental philosophy in its bearing on teaching. Here however it may suflice to say that one of the first things needed in early training is to teach a child how to use his fingers, his ears, and hig eyes; and that whether he does this well or ill makes a great difference to him all through his later course.

tomed to gaze aimlessly and vaguely at the things around him, 
He who has been taught, by exercises ever so childish, steadi- 
ness of hand and precision of touch, is better fitted hereafter 
to be a good draughtsman or musician. And no training of 
ear to the finer differences of vocal inflection and expression is 
without a very important bearing on literary perception and 
taste. We need not concern ourselves here with subtle specula- 
tions as to the exact priority or interdependence of sensual and 
intellectual perception. “‘ Nihil in intellectd quod non prius in 
sensit,” may or may not be a tenable dogma in speculative phi- 
losophy; but we know at least that the development of greater 
sensitiveness to sight and sound is accompanied, almost neces- 
sarily, with the development of intellectual power; that out- 
ward expression is a great help to inward clearness; and that 
whether we call the quickening of physical sensibility a part of 
lower or of higher education, it is too important a factor in the 
life and usefulness of a man to be disregarded by any teacher 
whether high or low. 
In the later stages of education, you do not so much concern 
yourself with conscious training of the senses, in the form of 
direct exercises, although you know that some studies, notably 
botany, chemistry, drawing and music have special value in 
making observation and hearing accurate. And you should 
not lose sight of the fact that over and above the practical or 
intellectual uses of these studies, there is a distinct gain from 
them in the form of a finer sensibility, and of new capacity for 
interpreting and enjoying the world your pupil has come to 
live in, Still, within the ordinary domain of school life, the 
exercises which specially concern the use.of the senses are (1) 
the discipline of the Infant School, and (2) the arts of reading 
and writing and drawing as practised later. To these we must 
confine our present inquiries. 
The necessity for more definite and intentional training of

  the senses has been insisted on with much earnestness by Pests 
The Kinder- lozzi, by Rousseau, and by George Combe, and garten. you will do well to study, in some detail, what 
those writers have said on the subject. But it is to Frobel that 
we owe the clearest recognition of the main principle, and the 
most systematic effort to reduce that principle to practical ap- 
Plication. His method of infant training, to which the rather 
fanciful name of Kindergarten has been given, has been ex- 
pounded with much care and clearness by Miss Shirreff, by 
Miss Maning, and in German by the Baroness Bilow, all of 
whom have the true spirit of discipleship; for they begin by 
reverencing their master, and end by interpreting his message to 
the world more clearly than he was able to explain it for himself. 
Frébel devised a series of exercises for young children be- 
ginning at the age of three or four, He know that the first things children want to do are to see, to handle, to move about and to exercise their senses, and he sought to arrange a set of ‘simple and appropriate employments, with 2 conscious educa- 
tional purpose, and in careful obedience to the suggestions of Nature. To the youngest he gives a box of wooden bricks, to arrange, and to build up, in imitation of the model designs, made before him by the teacher. Then come exercises in the careful folding of colored papers into different forms; the Plaiting of straw or strips of paper into patterns, the pricking, or sewing with colored thread of little pictured diagrams; the tracing of lines gradually increasing in length, number, and 
complexity, so as to develop, unexpectedly, new and pleasing geometrical designs, Besides these Frébel provides organized games, little dramatic performances, dances and physical move- ments of a rhythmic kind, to simple music, and conversational lessons in which the little ones are made to talk about a picture, to assume and act out their several parts, and to help one an other piece together their experiences of a farm-yard or a garden, of a street or of a kitchen. T have seen many such little experi- ments in Kindergarten schools, or rather in those infant schools which have a kindergarten department; and there is no doubt  
-P-A-G-E-186
Merits of the Kindergarten System. 183 
  
that the system, in the hands of bright and sympathetic teach- 
ers has many very substantial advantages. Frdbel’s method 
certainly increases the happiness of little children; jtg advan- 
and thisis a clear gain. It greatly diminishes the ses. 
difficulty of the problem, how to fill up their time at school; 
for a long day spent in any one of the ordinary forms of in- 
struction is very wearisome to young children; and teachers 
have long been wanting to know how to vary the employments 
of infants in a school, so as to keep them under discipline, and . 
at the same time to avoid tiring and overstraining them with 
lessons, and giving them unpleasant associations with the 
thought of learning. To such teachers, the little gifts and ex- 
ercises of Frdbel are a great boon. Interspersed among the 
graver employments, they absorb the attention and powers of 
the little ones, without giving them any sense of fatigue. In- 
fants learn obedience, fixed attention, accuracy of eye, steadi- 
ness of hand; they learn to count, and to know the nature of 
color and of form. They are exercised in imitation, in inven- 
tion, and in the elements of drawing and design, And all 
these lessons are learned in the best of all ways; without being 
considered as lessons; not indeed in the shape of lessons at all, 
but rather as so much play, They are in fact organized play, 
with a conscious and direct educational purpose. But this pur- 
pose is not obtruded before the children, who think that they 
are being amused when in fact they are -being systematically 
taught. Experience shows that children who have been dis- 
ciplined on this system are found (1) to have got the rudiments 
of writing, counting, and drawing, and to be better prepared _ 
for the ordinary subjects of school instruction than others; and 
(2) to have obtained in an indirect way a good deal of use- 
ful training which shows itself in quickened sensibility, and 
prompter intelligence. 
Hence I strongly recommend those of you whose advice is 
likely to be asked as to the organization of preparatory schools 
for very young children to make yourselves acquainted with 
some of the books I have named, and to be ready to take ad-

vantage of the good parts of the system. At the same time, 1 
may venture to add two or three cautions, which the writers of 
books on the system do not give. Ido not blame them for 
this. The best work in the world is not done by. criticism, but 
by enthusiasm. The sort of cold-blooded and balanced esti 
mation of the good and bad points in a system, which is ap- 
. propriate for us in this place, is not to be expected or indeed to 
be desired on the part of those earnest men and women, who in 
. Tebelling against the inert and unintelligent discipline to which 
little children are often subjected, have perhaps exaggerated 
the value of Frobel’s method. Let us admit that if they had 
not seen that method in a very strong—perhaps even an untrue 
light,—they would not have made so many converts, or done 
nearly so much good.

who just seek to carry out the methods in a book of diagrams

singing and reciting childish verses. He is apt to mistake 
means for ends. He has got hold of a novel and pleasing in- 
strument for occupying the attention of the children; and he 
thinks that so long as they are orderly and attentive, all is well. 
He keeps the little ones looking at diagrams and pictures, when 
he might be teaching them to read. He employs them in mak- 
ing marks, of which they sce no meaning, when their faculties 
of imitation might just as well be exercised in a writing lesson. 
He allows them to spend much time in the manufacture of 
woven patterns and paper ornaments, which the child sees to 
have no value in themselves, Jong after the time when the

plied to drawing, or sewing, or knitting, or something else 
which the children know to be of real use. Children know 
very well that they come to school to lean, They want to do 
something of which they can sce the purpose. They are not 
being well prepared for the serious work of school, or of after 
life, if all that they are required to do looks like amusement 
and play. The Kindergarten gives them nothing which seems 
like work; it does not train them to overcome difficulties. 
Let us be clear on this point. Do not let us manufacture 
difficulties under a notion that we have to brace and harden 
children’s natures; but, on the other hand, do not let us elabo- 
rately keep all difficulties out of Sight. This is just as grave 
an error. Let us admit the paramount necessity of the training 
of faculties, Nay, let us go farther, and confess that nine 
teachers out of ten err by overlooking this view of their work, 
and supposing that the whole of their business is to impart in- 
struction. Nevertheless we must bear in mind that school life 
is too short to justify us in spending much time in training, for 
the sake of training ; and that when we have got a power or 
faculty into vigorous action the sooner we set it to work on 
some of the practical problems of life the better. 
Besides, though the faculty of observation is a very useful 
one, it is qnite possible to exaggerate its importance. In the 
long run it is a less valuable factor in the intellectual life than

the habit of reflection. And the Kindergarten does little or 
The habit of nothing to encourage reflection. It helps children 
observation to appreciate more clearly the visible and the con- 
mountim- crete; but it scarcely conducts them a step to- portance, wards the abstract and the invisible. They learn to 
look, to hear, to act in concert; but all the thinking, and nearly 
all the talking is done by the teacher for them. This is not a 
fault in the system, but it is one of the limits to its usefulness, 
and we must bear it in mind, : 
In studying Frobel’s life and doings, you will, I think, re- 
Frébeland spect his enthusiasm, and admire his childlike 
his work. sympathetic nature, You will not, I think, come 
to the conclusion that he took a large or very sound view of the 
purpose of education as a whole, He was not a scholar, and 
to the last he somewhat undervalued the sort of knowledge 
which is to be got from books, But he saw with intense clear- 
ness certain simple truths which bear on the discipline and 
happiness of little children. Let us be thankful for such seers 
and prophets, even if they only give us half-truths, There is 
something touching-in the remark of the Baroness Bilow, one 
of his most earnest disciples, ‘The heavenly light given to a 
man seldom spreads its ray over the whole of his being; but 
only lights up the field whereon he is called to build.” It is 
well for each of us if the light is clear and steadfast enough to 
show us the duty which we can do best. For Frébel the field 
thus illuminated extended over the heart and the life of child- 
hood, the beginnings of knowing and thinking, the functions 
and the duties of the primary teacher—a region which indeed. 
has definite frontiers, but is wide and varied enough to satisfy 
a mouch more daring ambition than his, 
I repeat, then, that whenever you have the opportunity of 
exercising influence over a preparatory school, you will do well 
to see that in reasonable measure the methods of Frébel are 
adopted. They will have value up to the age of seven if Judiciously incorporated with other forms of early instruction,

although, for the reasons I have given, I do not think that they 
should be allowed to supersede such instruction, 
And now let us gather together a few of the plainer results 
of experience in reference to the teaching of the rudimentary 
arts of reading, spelling, and writing. 
One of the first difficulties with which we are confronted is 
the fact that our language presents so many ortho- 
graphical and phonetic anomalies, In this respect 
it differs notably from French, in which there are comparatively 
few, from German, in which there are fewer, and from Italian, 
in which there are scarcely any. We all know that ours is a 
composite speech, a conglomerate of many languages; that the 
portion of it which was spoken before it was written—the 
purely English portion and the earlier derivatives from Latin 
and from Norman French—is full of queer and capricious 
spelling; while other portions of it, the Greek and the Latin 
derivatives, which have come to us later through the medium 
of literature, are, on the whole, spelled according to a consis- 
tent system, and present little or no difficulty. If we want an 
exhaustive and very entertaining summary of the chief diffi- 
culties presented by our English system of spelling, I may refer 
you to Prof, Meiklejohn’s clever little book, ‘‘ The Problem of 
Teaching to Read.” Here it may suffice briefly to indicate the 
nature of the difficulty which has to be surmounted. 
There is first of all our anomalous alphabet. And it would 
be easy to show that it has every fault that an The anom- 
alphabet can have. A perfect alphabet should, it alies of the 
may well be argued, have a single and fixed char- Alphabet. 
acter for every single indivisible elementary sound. It should 
have such compound characters for composite or diphthongal 
sounds as would indicate clearly the elements of which they 
are composed. It should also have similar characters for 
analogous or related sounds, Nothing is easier than to lay 
down these conditions, and to see that our alphabet violates 
every one of them. It is at the same time redundant and de- Reading.
-P-A-G-E-191
190 Preparatory Training. 
  
fective. It has not enough characters, and those which it bas 
it does not make the best of; e.g.: 
(1) A single and indivisible consonant is sometimes expressed 
by a clumsy combination of two letters instead of one charac- 
ter, as thin, thine, should. 
(2) There are often two or more ways of writing the same 
sound, as fancy, philosophy, and rough. ‘Duty, newter, lewd, 
and beauty. Nation, sure, shall, viecous. 
(8) The same letter has many sounds, as father, fan, fate, fall. 
(4) The alphabet disguises altogether the true elements of 
composite sounds: the sound of of] is not made up of o and ¢, 
but of au and ee. 
(5) It fails altogether to indicate the true relations between 
cognate sounds; the 7 in pine is called the long sound of the ¢ 
in pin; but these sounds are not related; the true lengthening 
of pén is into peen, not pine. So the p is related to the 6 in the 
same manner as the ¢ to the @ or the s to the 2; but there is no 
such similarity of characters as to represent these relations. 
(6) It sometimes gives us a compound sound expressed by a 
single letter, as Reject, congeal. 
(% It more often gives. group of letters to represent a single 
indivisible sound—Daughter, though. 
(8) The names of the letters are very misleading as represen- 
tations of their powers, as Gee for G. Adtch for H. Double 
you for W. 
Such is only a part of the indictment against the English 
Proposed Alphabet, Shall we try to get up a society for 
, Teform of ofthe reforming it? Well, I for one should not. First, Iphal because the task is so formidable. To do it ef- 
fectually we must have 88 characters instead of 26; we must 
cease to employ many of the letters we now use, and the whole 
aspect of the written language must be altered. And even 
when. the written language had been truly conformed to the 
speech of the capital and of educated persons, it would remain 
untrue and non-phonetic in Yorkshire and Devonshire, and 
even in Scotland and Ireland, unless all provincialisms and dia-
-P-A-G-E-192
The English Alphabet. 191 
  lectic varieties are to be obliterated; which is neither probable, 
nor in itself eminently desirable. Then the price we should 
pay for such a reform would be very heavy. We of this gen- 
eration, who have been educated in the anomalous system, 
would learn the new one, I grant, without much difficulty; and 
for our lifetimes both the old and the new literature would be 
read. But to the next generation, educated on the more 
rational principle, our present spelling would be hopelessly un- 
intelligible, and the whole of our past literature, everything that 
is not worth re-printing, would become a foreign language, and 
would remain unread by our successors, It is not easy to see 
how such a result could be avoided; yet, if it occurred, the gain 
would be enormously counterbalanced by the loss. 
Again, the difficulties of our present system may easily be ex- 
aggerated, and have been exaggerated. The syllables which are 
not spelt phonetically are, relatively to the whole language, 
not very numerous. 
Our alphabet also is a historic one, and like the British consti- 
tution represents historic growth. Its very anomalies throw a 
great deal of light on the history and origin of words. No 
doubt the spelling is occasionally misleading too, on this point, 
If I lay down a rule, that whenever f is represented by ph, or k 
by ch, the word is Greek, or that whenever ¢ represents s and 
commences a syllable the word is Latin; or that whenever w 
comes before / it is English, we may find exccptions to the rule; 
yet in nineteen cases out of twenty the rule is good; and thus 
the very inconsistencies of our alphabet often furnish a key to 
the meaning or history of a word. 
. Lastly, I would not advise spending much time on an effort 
for a sweeping legal reform in our alphabet, be- 4 comowhat 
cause there is little or no chance of its success. popelese 
Consider what has happened in the matter of deci- 
malizing our weights and measures. Our present arithmetical 
tables are far more clumsy and indefensible than our alphabet. 
They give a great deal more of trouble to teachers, and of 
mental entanglement to pupils. Moreover it would be a far
-P-A-G-E-193
  192 Preparatory Training. 
  
easier process to reform them. Many proposals for adopting 
the French systéme métrique or at least for decimalizing and sim- 
plifying our present weights and measures have been made 
from time to time. But the English people and its parliament 
have steadily opposed all these projects, and we seem at this 
moment much farther from the adoption of a rational and sim- 
ple system of compound arithmetic than we were twenty years 
ago. And we may conclude, in like manner, that though in- 
genious proposals will be made from time to time, for the 
amendment, on philosophical principles, of English spelling, 
those proposals have little chance of being carried out in our 
time. By the general consent of literary and learned people we 
may fairly hope that some improvements may be effected and 
the more grotesque anomalies removed. But the conservative 
instincts of the nation in matters like this are very strong; and 
I think it in the highest degree unlikely that for the sake of 
saving a little trouble to teachers, the nation will put itself to 
the inconvenience of adopting a new alphabet and making a 
break in the continuity of its own literary life. 
So we may make up our minds that any effort to obtain a 
‘The lan- complete and scientific reform in the English 
guage, esit alphabet, will probably be futile; and that any 
be taught. other than a complete reform would hardly be 
worth contending for. It may go a little way to reconcile some 
of us to this conclusion, if we reflect that after all the anomalies 
and difticulties do not seem so great toa little child as to us. 
He accepts the spelling you teach him, on your authority, and 
he is very little impressed by its want of philosophic precision . 
You spell the word mat, and as there are three distinct sounds 
represented by three distinct letters, which are tolerably uni- 
form in their powers, the word satisfies you. And then you 
spell the word through, and you feel it to be unsatisfactory. 
The first word is spelt philosophically, the second is spelt un- 
Philosophically. But to the child, though one is a little easier 
than the other, it is just as arbitrary. He receives them both on your authority. To him it is all alike mysterious. Neither

his moral nor his phonetic sensibilities are wounded by un- 
philosophical spelling. You will have to tell him the one word | 
twice over and the other only once. But when once thoroughly 
known, it is known for life, and he will not be troubled by its 
anomalous character. Nay, he will never know that there és 
any anomaly in it, until in the fulness of time he is old enough 
to become a member of the Philological Society or the Spelling 
Reform Association, and to have his critica] faculty called into 
action under its auspices. 
It is, then, the English language as it is, and not as it might 
be, nor even as it ought to be, that we have to soges of 
take for better for worse, and to teach in the best teaching 
way we'can. How shall we set about it? There 
are, as is well known, three different methods: 
() There is the method of teaching the Alphabet first, then 
proceeding to words of two letters, then to words of three, and 
soonin order. This is a method of synthesis. 
(2) There is what is called the Look and say method, which 
begins by showing children words, and requiring them to be 
recognized as a whole and pronounced, before calling attention 
to the letters of which they are composed. This is a method of 
analysis. 
(8) There is the Phonic method, which avoids the names of 
the letters at first altogether, and simply seeks to teach their 
powers. Groups of words are given in which the same sounds 
occur, and these words are decomposed into their elementary - 
sounds, which children are taught to utter separately. 
Now, in favor of the last method, it may be truly urged that 
the real composition of the utterances we call words, is better 
seen by rendering them into their elementary sounds, than by 
calling those elements by arbitrary names. That is quite true. 
But the objection to it is that the same letter has so many dif- 
ferent sounds, that even if I learn to identify each with a sound 
and not a name, I ghall be constantly making mistakes, e.g., 
you give the significance of /, and illustrate it by lend, Jo, wi, 
and full, and then you come to a word like should, in which it 
13
-P-A-G-E-195
i 
                              194 Preparatory Training. 
  
is not pronounced at all. Writers of Phonic reading books 
get over this difficulty by printing in italics the letters which 
are not sounded, and by printing over those yowels or combina- 
tions of letters which have an abnormal sound, an accent or 
mark of some kind to indicate their exceptional characters. 
But the objection to this is that ordinary books are not printed 
thus, and that therefore the child will have something to unlearn 
when he goes from his special phonic school-book to any other. 
A graver objection to this method, and the real cause of its 
failure, is the extreme difficulty of isolating elementary sounds 
and pronouncing them apart. 
The method would not be unsuited to older people who were 
learning the written language for the first time, but it pre- 
supposes that little children are more distressed by orthographic 
anomalies than they really are. They can in fact, pronounce 
words, and divide them into syllables; but to them the analysis 
of syllables into their components is a task much harder than 
the mere learning of arbitrary characters, . 
Against the purely Alphabetic method it is easy to urge that 
the names of the letters do not express their powers; that singly 
and apart they have no meaning for children, and are held in 
the mind by no associations; that analysis is always easier than 
synthesis, and that it would interest a child much more to learn 
about a word first and examine its parts afterwards, than to 
begin with the letters which, after all, do not really represent 
its parts and afterwards to build up the whole. 
On the other hand, the “Look and say method,” which seeks 
to give a child a picture of a word as a whole, and teaches him 
to read rather by the general aspect of words than by careful 
observation of their parts, is open to the objection that many 
words have a general resemblance in their form, eg. form and From, there and. three, board and broad, which might be mis- leading, if they were not subjected to close inspection. And this method, if depended on entirely, is apt to encourage loose, care- Jess, visual impressions, out of which mistakes constantly arise. 
Again, the philosophers who are so sensible of the incon-
-P-A-G-E-196
Metheds of Teaching Reading. 195 
  
gruity of our alphabet and of the arbitrary and misleading 
effect of the names of the letters, seem to forget that long before 
children. come under regular instruction, they have actually 
learned the alpbabet in the nursery or in the Kindergarten ; 
they have merely in a game handled little wooden letters as 
toys, talked about them and arranged them in different ways; 
and they have seen no more difficulty in calling a | Particular 
character H, than in calling a horse a horse, 
You have therefore to deal with the fact, that in nine cases 
out of ten the alphabet, with its indefensible nomenclature, is 
already known, having been learned in fact in the- most effec- 
tual way, without the child’s consciousness that he was learning 
anything. And after all the art of recognizing printed words 
ought always to be acquired thus, little by little, in short and 
playful lessons, while children are very young, and before any 
appeal is made to their reflection at all. I believe that it is a 
grave mistake to postpone the first exercises in reading after 
the fourth year, and that the longer it is postponed the more 
difficult it becomes. But if this has not been done, and a child 
of six or seven has to start de novo, it is certainly not well to 
begin by presenting the alphabet. The best way then is to 
_ place before him a printed sheet with very easy sentences on it, 
and to read aloud a whole sentence, pointing to cach word as 
itis pronounced. Next the children should be invited to read 
it with the teacher aloud; then to read it together without any 
help; then one and another should be called on to point and 
identify each single word. So far the Look and Say method is 
right. But this lesson should be followed up by asking them 
in turn to count the number of letters in each word, and by 
writing each of them down, and giving their names. A card 
containing the alphabet should hang near, and as each letter 
occurs in the words of the little sentence, it should be pointed 
out and named. In this way, though the alphabet would not 
be taught at first as a whole, or as a separate lesson, each letter 
of it would be learned as it was wanted, and as it occurred in 
some word previously read. :
-P-A-G-E-197
    196 Preparatory Training. 
  
The requirements of a good reading-book have already been 
Reading- referred to. It may be well to recall attention to 
books, them here: 
(1) It should be well printed and in sufficiently large type to 
make it very easy for the child to put bis finger to each word 
as he pronounces it. 
@) It should be made attractive by pictures, and by the 
pleasantness and interest of the subject. This is of the first im- 
portance, 
(8) The lessons should not be graduated by so mechanical a 
rule as the mere length of the words and number of syllables. 
" Many words of three letters are harder than those of five; and 
words like winter and summer are much easier though they 
have two syllables in them than words like eye, who, and laugh, 
though they have one. ‘The real gradation does not depend on 
the length and number of the syllables, but on the number of 
anomalies or difficulties in the words. The early lessons should 
have no anomalous words at all. But each new lesson should 
contain two or three combinations harder than those of the 
previous lesson, and several examples of each. 
@ If possible let a good many of the lessons be narrative and 
in the form of dialogue, giving some play for changes of voice. 
Monotony is encouraged by always reading sentences consist- 
‘ing of assertions only. 
(5) Again every:lesson should contain at least two or three 
words which are a little beyond the chiid’s own vocabulary, 
and which therefore when learned will be distinct additions to 
it. This is very important. One of the first objects of a read- 
ing lesson is to enrich the scholar’s store of words. A lesson 
which is so ostentatiously childish that it fails to add anything 
to this store, or to furnish material for questions, represents a 
lost opportunity. 
(6) Yet it is of very little consequence that the reading lessons 
should be obviously didactic or instructive, or indeed that they should convey any information whatever. Later on, of course, 
‘we regard reading as a means to an end, and that end is instruc-

tion or mental culture; but in the early stages, reading is itself 
anend, And whatever conduces to make it more interesting 
facilitates the acquisition of the art. 
And now suppose a book is found which fulfils these con- 
ditions, how is it to be used? 
First it is well to read the passage aloud very carefully with 
the proper intonation, requiring the scholars to fix Teaching 
their eyes on the book, and to follow the teacher, Reading. 
pointing out word by word as he utters it. 
Next, a simultaneous exercise is often found very useful. 
The teacher reads the lesson again, and asks the whole classeto 
read it with him slowly, but still with all the proper pauses and 
inflexions. 
The third step is to call upon the class to read the lesson 
simultancously without him. 
Then he challenges the scholars one after another to read the 
sentences separately, selecting them by name promiscuously, 
.and causing the worst readers to be appealed to much oftener 
than the rest. 
Afterwards he causes the books to be closed, and proceeds to 
give a few simple questions on special words, and to require 
separate little sentences to be turned into others which are 
equivalent, and of which the words are supplied by the 
scholars, 
As to spelling, it is often the practice to print at the top of a 
reading lesson the few hardest words, and cause Spelling. 
them to be specially spelt. I see no particular 
use in this. An isolated word has very little meaning or use to 
children. But they understand sentences. It is far better to 
read the sentence in which a word occurs, and then ask to 
have it spelled. And it isa good thing often to cause whole 
sentences to be spelled, the class taking one word after 
another. 
“« The sun sheds light upon the earth.” 
You have all the words spelled rapidly through, but you 
halt at the word “Light.” ‘You call attention to it, You

write it on the black-board. You say “I notice this word was 
difficult, Let us spell it again. I will show you three or four 
other words formed like it, Bright, Might, Fight. Let us put 
these into sentences, and spell them.” 
Thus you encounter the difficulties of spelling, as you en- 
counter all the other difficulties of life, as they come before 
you, one by one; and try to conquer them in detail. Do not 
accumulate the difficulties in a menacing and artificial column, 
and expect them to be dealt with all at once. That isunreason- 
able. But a difficulty that emerges naturally in the course of 
a lesson is grappled with willingly, and there is some interest 
in taking the opportunity of calling attention to a few words 
of like character, and so of disposing of that particular diffi- 
culty once for all. Only in choosing your reading books, and 
selecting reading lessons, take care that each of the difficulties 
you want to solve shall occur in its own proper place some 
time or other. 
Columns of words arranged alphabetically, dictionary fash-

spelt should be seen in sentences in their proper connection, not in artificial groups invented by the book-makers. 
And with regard to the large number of words which are 
sounded alike but spelt differently, the simplest way of dealing 
with them is not to give them separate meanings, but to put 
them into little sentences, e.g. 
The wind blew hard; The sky is dive, 
I stood by the sea; He came to sce me. 
- This is their book; He will stay there all night,

But after all, it is to be borne in mind that spelliag is a mat- 
ter for the eye, not for the ear. If it were not Spelling is 
that we had to write, spelling would be an alto- fr the eye, 
gether useless accomplishment; and it is onfy ear. 
when we write that any deficiency in this respeet comes to 
light. The notion of the extreme importance attached to ortho- 
dox spelling is comparatively modern.- Our ancestors, as you 
will easily find if you read the Paston Letters, or old MS. in 
the British Museum, thought it an accomplishment to spell a 
word in many different ways, and you will often find the same 
word in two or three different forms in one document, But 
since Johnson, with, the general consent of the literary men of 
his time, sought to fix the spelling of the language, there has 
come to prevail in England an impression that Bad spelling is a 
mark of extreme ignorance, if not worse. Of course this is a 
very conventional and unreal standard of ignorance; but we 
must take the world as we find it, and must acquiesce in the fact 
that whatever else we teach our scholars we shall get no credit 
for doing anything if they cannot spell. And the person who 
spells well is simply he who carries in his memory a good vis- 
ual impression of the picture of the word as it appears in a 
written or printed book. If he has not this, it is to no purpose 
that he can, merely as a memory lesson, recall the letters when 
you exercise him in oral spelling. And if he has this, all else 
is unnecessary. There are many persons, who, if you ask them 
how to spell receive or how many s’s there are in necessary, 
would not tell you readily, but would say at once, ‘Let me 
write the word down, and I will tell you if it is right.” And 
if it is written down incorrectly, it is the eye which is offended 
by not secing the accustomed picture of the word; it is not the . 
verbal memory or the reason which sets them right. 
And hence we may infer that it is mainly by writing that 
spelling is to be taught. And the familiar exer- 5, tion, 
cise of Dictation known in all schools is the prac- 
tical recognition of this obvious truth. But there are skilful 
and unskilful ways even of conducting a dictation lesson, and I

hope it'is‘not beneath the dignity of this place to add a few 
“words on this very simple matter. 
In giving out a sentence, some teachers pronounce one word 
ata time; in aloud monotone. But this method is unsatisfac- 
tory, for however loudly and clearly uttered, single words are 
easily misunderstood. Others read short fragments, and repeat 
them two, three, and even four times. This plan also leads to 
mistakes, for when once a word is written, it is distracting and 
annecessary to hear it again. 
The best way is first of all to read the whole passage 
through once so as to give its general meaning and purpose; 
afterwards to read it piecemeal, one member of a sentence at a 
dme, to read it only once, but with the inflection and tone 
which carries its meaning; and to leave a sufficiently long 
pause after each fragment to allow the slowest writer time to 
write it. The pauses should not be determined by the stops, 
nor by any rule about uniform length; but should come be- 
tween the logical elements of the sentence, so that each piece 
to be carried in the memory should have a unity and meaning 
ef itsown. Here is an example: 
“1 ‘was yesterday | about sunset | walking in the epen fields | , until the night | insensibly fell | upon me. |I at first | amused myself | with all the richness | and variety of colots | whith appeared | in the western Parts | of heaven,” .

avoid mistakes, it is evident that this form of exercise is not 
less effective. When the exercise is finished it may often be 
examined and corrected by the help of the scholars themselves,

It is to no purpose that you explain a new word, discuss its origin and its various shades of meaning, and call attention to the peculiarities of its spelling, so long as the word still remains like the name of some foreign city, outside the range of his own knowledge or experience. The first thing to do with a word which you thus give to your scholar is to teach © him to use it, ‘Put it into a sentence, Make up a little nar- rative in which this word shall occur.” Not tili you have done this have you any security that the word in question has been appropriated and become a real part of his vocabulary. 
We have already said that every new word which we thus add to a child’s store, is a new instrument of thought, and does something to widen the horizon of his understanding. So I would say generally, “ Never explain or spell a new word, without calling upon the scholar soon after to make use of it in & sentence of his own,” 
One other caution is needed here; Do not try to teach spell- 
ing by the use of incorrect examples. In my Spelling nbt 
school days, it was the custom to set from a by ceoaeee 
printed book, letters and extracts grotesquely mis- examples, spelled, and to tell us to re-write them without mistake. I believe this practice has nearly died out. .But I hope every 
one here sees the fundamental objection to it and indeed to all such devices. Writing and spelling are imitative arts, and it 
is essential that the eye should see none but good models for
-P-A-G-E-203
202 Preparatory Training. 
  
imitation. We have said that to spell a word well is to have 
an accurate picture of it before the visual memory, so to speak. 
But if we set a wrong picture before the learner, how do we 
know that he will not carry that with him instead of the true 
one? For here there is no absolute right and wrong, nothing 
in which the judgment can help to set him right, It is alla 
matter of arbitrary usage and habit; and it is therefore desir- 
able that the only words which meet his eye should be 
rightly spelt. 
. Now assuming that you have taught reading well enough to 
Thonghtful give to your scholars fluency and readiness and 
and effective the power to understand a book, is it right to stop 
there? Most teachers do stop there. They think 
they have put into the hands of their scholars the instrament 
of all further acquisitions and that there is anend to it. Read- 
ing aloud, considered as a fine art, is very much neglected in 
schools, especially in the more advanced schools for boys; 
because there it is undervalued, and thought of far less im- 
portance than the attainment of knowledge. Without discuss- 
ing this, we may affirm that if the attention of teachers was 
once directed to the extreme usefulness of this art, they would 
try to find some time for practising it. Consider how rare an 
accomplishment that of really good reading is. Consider how 
great an acquisition one person who is a fine and expressive 
reader is in a household, how much he or she can do to add fo 
the charm, the happiness, and to the intelligence of the home. 
By. fine reading, of course I do not mean pompous stagy elocu-

means of culture. We have said before that to teach is to learn. So also to read aloud, to read for others, to read so as 
to enlighten, to charm, to move your auditors, is the infallible 
secret of being enlightened, of being charmed, of being moved 
yourself. Of many of the best books it may be truly said that 
they are never thoroughly comprehended, until they are weil 
read or recited. And if you will further consider that the 
human voice is the most vivid translation of human thought, 
that it is the most supple, the most docile, the most eloquent 
interpreter of whatever is best in the reason and in the heart of 
man, you will see that there is a very real connection between 
right thought and right utterance; and that anything you can do to make speech more finished, more exact, more expressive, 
and more beautiful, will have a very direct bearing on the 
mental and spiritual culture of your pupils. Finally, let me 
remind you that of all the arts and accomplishments we pos- 
sess, this is the one which comes iuto use most frequently; and 
that what is done oftenest should be done best. 
It would carry us too far to attempt here even a compendi- 
um of the rules on which good elocution depends. Chief con- 
But three points of paramount importance you ditions of 
will do well to keep in view: They are sood reading. 
(@) Distinct articulation; the power to utter clearly every 
syllable and especially every consonant. You should get to- 
gether a list of words and of sentences in which there is a 
special tendency to pronounce three syllables as two, or to 
elide a consonant, e.g. “ necessary, distinctness, Hast thou 
been? And keep his commandments.” Pronounce these 
words and sentences rapidly, and you will see that a little 
effort is required to enunciate the letters in italics with perfect 
distinctness, Keep your ear open for faults of this kind and 
correct them at once in reading, before the careless habit of 
slurred and confused utterance is formed. ‘A former colleague 
of mine, Mr. Brookfield, who was himself a very fine reader, 
was wont to give this counsel, ‘Remember your consonants 
and forget yourself.”
-P-A-G-E-205
204 Preparatory Training. 
@) Frequent pause. To form a habit of good reading, it is 
necessary to begin by reading slowly; and to make habitually. 
many more breaks or pauses than are indicated by the punctu- 
ation. The right way of placing these pauses will become 
clear to any one who has learned to analyze a sentence into 
subject, predicate, and adjuncts. It is a safe rule that a slight 
rhetorical pause, hardly a stop, should mark the logical -divi- 
sions of every sentence, should come, e.g., after a nominative, 
especially when it is formed of two or three words, before 
every preposition, conjunction, and relative, and before any 
word or phrase which needs to be emphasized. 
(© Just intonation and expression. From the first the mono- 
tone in which children are apt to read should be discouraged, 
and-they should be trained to read as they speak, putting the 
game variety of inflections into the printed words, as into their 
own conversation. This may be secured partly by the selec- 
tion of well-varied pieces; partly by challenging pupils, when- 
ever they are reading in an artificial tone, to close the book, 
and tell the substance of what they have read in their own 
. words; and partly by enforcing the rule that the eye should 
always travel several words in advance of the word actually 
read, in order that the bearing of the uttered word on its con- text may be fully known, 
Besides the art of reading, or reproducing printed words, ral ex- you should have in view the usefulness of oral ex- 
a . pression, or the utterance of the’ pupil’s own ights in his own words. This is too much neglected in    
   
   
         rly the exact form in which he jearned them. You will do well to say in the last five minutes 
‘of. lesson, ‘‘ Which of you can give me the best account of 
‘what we have learned?” ‘Who can tell me now the anecdote 
which:J related just now?” There will thus be an exercise in 
-consecutive expression, and in the choice and use of words, 
guch as is‘not to be bad in the mere answering of definite ques-

tions. The practice will give a little trouble at first, and pupils 
will be shy in replying; but once adopted, it will be found very 
helpful in giving fluency and confidenct, and it will have an 
excellent reflex action on the reading, especially on the ease 
and naturalness of the tone.

ing of the class by some of the best scholars, who have taken 
special pains to prepare it. 
It is well also to cause interesting passages from good orators 
or poets to be learned by heart, and to be repeated with particular 
reference to accuracy of pronunciation and just expression. 
In many schools it is found a useful and interesting practice 
to reserve half an hour a week for giving, in the The teacher's 
hearing of the scholars, a carefully chosen reading OW? pattern 
from some good poem or narrative. If you reading. 
choose such a passage as will awaken the attention, and read it 
so that it shall be a treat to the scholars to listen to it, they will 
not only have a model for imitation, but they will look with 
more favor on the art of reading itself, as a means of giving 
.and receiving pleasure. 
And this, and indeed all my rules, presuppose that the 
teacher should be himself a good reader. You can never bring 
your scholars up to your own level. So that if you wish their 
level to be tolerably high, your own level should be exception- 
ally high. No pains that you can take with yourself to in- 
crease the power, the sweetness, and the flexibility of your own 
voice will be wasted. Reading is an imitative art, and if you 
are to teach it well, you must first think careful elocution worth 
acquiring, and then acquire it for yourself. 
Writing is one of the subjects on which there seems to be 
least to say. We all feel that it is a matter of writing. 
practice mainly, not of theory. In teaching it 
there are few or no principles to explain, and a great many ex- 
ercises to do.
-P-A-G-E-207
206 Preparatory Training. mee 
As an art it is greatly neglected in high and public schools. 
The habit of writing many notes, translation gnd other exer- 
cises betrays boys into a scribbling, running hand, before they 
ave taken pains to form single letters well; and very little is 
done to check this tendency. When it is considered how 
much a legible handwriting has to do with the comfort of one’s 
correspondents, there seems to be no good reason why young 
people who are to be brought up as gentlemen and gentle- 
‘women should write a worse hand than the children of a 
National School, or why some attention to writing per s¢ 
should not be given even in the higher classes at the best 
schools. . 
For every good teacher, in addition to the immediate and 
Tts indi- obvious results contemplated in giving lessons on 
rectimpor- _ a given subject, asks himself: “ What particular 
tance. faculties or qualities of mind ate being exercised 
in these lessons?” ‘‘ What is the incidental effect of the teach- 
ing of this subject on the formation of the intellectual charac- 
ter of my scholar?” And when he looks at writing from this 
point of view, he sees that it may be a training in accuracy 
of eye, in steadiness and flexibility of hand, in obedience and 
in cleanliness; and that every time a scholar receives a writing 
‘lesson, his habits are either being improved or deteriorated in 
‘ these respects, 
Now in all good elementary schools it is found easy to have 
. & standard of excellence in this matter, and to make every 
child conform to it. There are in fact no bad writers in an 
“elementary school of the best class, A good method stead- 
_“fastly carried out is found to be infallibly efficacious even in 
_, the worst cases, And this method is not elaborate. Mulhiuser 
-and others have devised a whole system of writing founded on 
the analysis of letters into their elements, and have given names 
to all the parts of which letters are formed, as the right line, 
oa, Yine, we bink, the loop, and the erotehet; and I have 
Ingenious lessons given of a synthetic kind, in which 
_ ‘models of these various parts having been shown their names

were dictated, so that letters and words emerged one after 
another, But in practice such systems have not been found of 
Touch use, for they make a needless demand on the memory, 
and they give separate names to things which have no separate 
value or meaning. The success attained in good elementary 
schools in teaching the art of writing is due to much simpler 
methods. A proper graduation of letters according to the 
difficulty and complexity of the lines composing them is found 
to fulfil the same purpose as a classification of those lines them- 
selves, There are but 26 letters; and if the n, m, J, uv, and @ are 
formed into one group, the 9, ¢, a, g, and @ into a second, the 
r, b, w, and » into a third, the g, 2, fj, p into a fourth; and if 
those letters which do not conform to these types, as 8, 2, &, 2, 
are reserved to the last, the classification suffices for practical 
purposes, and the teacher gives as copies in succession, not the. 
single letters, but little words which contain them, and which 
have more interest for children. 
A good copy being the first condition, careful supervision, 
and the prompt correction of each mistake, will do nearly all 
the rest. Complex oral directions as to how to hold the pen, 
and how to sit, are not needed. Gaucherie and bad attitude 
may be pointed out in special cases, but there is no harm in 
allowing different modes of handling a pen or pencil so long 
as the writing produced is good. The good teacher goes round 
the writing class to every scholar with a pencil in his hand; he 
‘calls attention to each mistake, forms in the next line @ letter to 
be traced over, desires his pupil to complete that line only, and 
to wait till it has been seen again. He notices each prevalent 
error in form or proportion, and on a ruled black-board in 
front of the class makes a good pattern of the particular 
letter, and causes it to be copied several times. He knows 
that if this is not done children copy their own mistakes, 
And generally he relies more on incessant watchfulness, on 
care that the same mistake shall not be made twice over, and 
on constant use of model writing, than on any theoretical in- 
struction.

The well-known passage from Locke sums up after all the 
Locke on best rules which have to be borne in mind in 
Writing. teaching this subject. He says 
“When a boy can read English well, it will be seasonable to enter him 
in Writing. Not only children, but anybody else that would do any- 
thing well should never be put upon too much of it at once, or be set to 
perfect themselves in two parts of an action at the same time, if they 
can possibly be separated. When he has learned to hold his pen right, 
. . the way to teach him without much trouble is to get a plate 
graved with the characters of such a hand as you like best, but you 
must remember to have them a pretty deal bigger than he should 
ordinarily write; for every one comés by degrees to write a less hand 
than he at first was taught, but never a bigger. . . Such @ plate being 
graved, let several sheets of good writing paper be printed off with red 
ink, which he has nothing to do but to go over with a good pen filled 
with black ink, which will quickly bring his hand to the formation of 
those characters, being at first showed when to begin, and how to form 
every letter. And when he can do that well he may exercise on fair 
paper, and so may easily be brought to write the hand you desire.” 
You have here enforced the two principal expedients for 
securing a good hand; (1) tracing, which is perhaps more 
effective from the teacher’s own pencil-marks than from faint 
engraved lines; and (2) insisting on large hand, and resisting 
for much longer than is usual the wish of scholars to write 
small or running-hand. Those who begin small writing too

210 The Study of Language. 
VIL THE STUDY OF LANGUAGE. 
Tux study of language has held a high place in most systems 
panguage of education. However far we go back in the 
pleor insurue. history of learning, we find that such subjects as ion, Srammar and rhetoric, which concerned them- 
selves with the right use and choice of words, have always 
formed, if not the chief, at any rate a prominent feature in the 
scheme of a liberal education. Indeed in the history of our 
Own country and in the practice of our Universities and public 
schools, linguistic studies have held a place so conspicuous, 
that they have well-nigh overshadowed all others. 
So it may be well to ask ourselves at the outset, Why should The reasons Wwe study language at all? On what reasons is the tor this, universal tradition in favor of philological and ' grammatical studies founded? Are those reasons valid? And if so, to what extent should they be accepted and acted on, having regard to the just claims of much new and useful knowledge of another kind? Speech we know is the one characteristic distinction of humanity. Every word which Words the has been invented is the record of some fact or former thought, and furnishes the means by which facts 7 or thoughts can be transmitted to others. In a sense, every new word represents a new conquest of civiliza- 
tlon, a distinct addition to’ the intellectual resources of the 
world. . To become acquainted with words, in their full signi- 
ficance, is to know much about the things they represent; and 
about the thoughts which other people have had respecting 
those things. The enlargement of our vocabulary, whether it 
i pe in English or any other language, means the enlargement of 
|   
-P-A-G-E-212
Extent and Variety of Vocabulary. 211 
  
our range of thought and the acquisition of new materials of 
knowledge. 
Moreover, the words we use are not merely the exponents of 
notions and thoughts which have existed in the 4.4 the in. 
minds of others; they are the very instruments struments of 
with which we think. We are unable to conesive "°™ ‘housht 
of any regular consecutive thinking,—any advance from what is 
known to what is unknown—except by the agency of language. 
Whatever therefore gives precision and method to our use of 
words, gives precision to our thoughts, Language as it has 
been formed by nations, embodied in literature, and formulated 
into grammar, corresponds in its structure to the evolution of 
thought inman. Every grammatical rule is, in another form, 
a rule of logic; every idiom, a representation of some moral 
differentia or characteristic of the people who have used it; 
every subtle verbal distinction is a key to some logical dis- 
tinction; every figure of speech, a symbol of some eftort of the 
human imagination to overleap the boundary of the prosaic 
and the actual, and to pass into the infinite region beyond; 
every verbal ambiguity is both the effect and the cause of men- 
tal confusion, And so the study of language is the study of 
humanity; the forms of language represent the forms of human 
thought; the history of language is the history of our race and 
its development, and great command over the resources of 
language is only another name for great command over the 
ideas and conceptions which make up the wealth of our in- 
tellectual life. 
Mr. Max Miiller-estimates the total number of English words 
at 50,000; he points out that the speaking VO- pytontana 
cabulary of an ordinary English citizen, who reads variety of 
his newspaper and books from Mudie’s, does ry. 
not extend beyond 3000 or 4000 words; that accurate thinkers 
and persons of wide knowledge probably use twice as many; 
that the Old Testament contains 5642 different words; that in 
all Milton’s works you will find only about 8000; and that 
Shakespeare, who displayed a greater variety of expression

than probably any writer in any language, produced all his 
plays with 15,000 words. And at the same time he tells us 
that an uneducated English peasant lives and dies with a 
vocabulary which scarcely extends beyond 300 words. You 
cannot reflect on a statement like this, and on all that it im- 
plies, without feeling convinced that all investigations into the 
growth of language, its structure, its history, and the philo- 
sophy and reason of its grammatical rules, must bave an im- 
portant bearing on the culture of the understanding, and be 
very fruitful both of useful knowledge and of mental exercise. 
It is a shallow thing to say that what the human being wants is 
a knowledge of things, and not words. Words are things; 
they embody facts. He who studies them is studying much 
more than sounds and letters. He is gaining an insight into 
the heart and reality of the things they represent. Let a battle- 
field or a storm at sea be viewed by a painter, by a poet, by a 
sailor, and by an ordinary observer;—or say, by a Frenchman 
and an Englishman. It will be described differently by them 
all. But be who understands the language of them all, sees it, 
80 to speak, with several pairs of eyes. And he is the richer, 
and his mind is the larger in consequence. 
Some such reasons as these no doubt underlie the very general assumption that a sound and liberal education should pay special regard to the study of language. And we in England have to deal with this practical question in three distinct forms, ‘We teach (1) the languages of Greece and Rome, which are familiarly called the classic languages; (2) some of the languages 
of. modern Europe; and (8) our own vernacular speech. We shall do well to take this opportunity of noting the special Teasons which justify each of these kinds of teaching. On ex- amination we shall find that in each we have a very different 
‘Object in view. There is, however, a sense in which all are 
‘alike valuable, and in which their study may be justified on 
the general grounds already indicated. 
But as we all know, the linguistic and philological culture to 
which most value has been attached is that which is to be gained

in the study of Latin and Greek. We still call the man who 
is familiar with these languages a scholar par Latin and 
ewcellence, and are inclined to withhold the title Greek. 
from one who, however learned in other ways, has no acquaint- 
ance with what are called the classics. Now without denounc- 
ing this state of opinion as a superstition as some do, it may be 
well to ask ourselves what is the origin of it; and how it ever 
came to pass that the Latin and Greek languages were regarded 
as the staple of all learning; almost the only knowledge worth 
acquiring? Let us look back—to a period 800 years ago, the 
time when Lyly wrote his Grammar, when Ascham was teach- 
ing Lady Jane Grey and Queen Elizabeth to read Plato, and 
when the most important of our great grammar schools were 
founded. If you had in those days asked Erasmus. or Sir 
Philip Sidney why Latin and Greek should hold this prominent, 
this almost exclusive rank, the reply would have been very 
easy. The books best worth reading in the world were written 
in those languages. If one wanted to see the best models of 
history, there were Thucydides and Livy; if he would know 
what dramatic art could be at its highest, he must read Sopho- 
cles and Euripides, or Plautus and Terence. If he would 
learn geometry, there was Euclid; rhetoric, he must read it in 
Quintillian or Aristotle; moral philosophy, in Plato or Cicero. 
“T expect ye,” wrote Sir Matthew Hale to his grandchildren, 
“‘to be good proficients in the Latin tongue, that ye may be 
able to read, understand, and construe any Latin author, and to 
make true and handsome Latin; and though I would have you 
Jearn something of Greek, yet the Latin tongue is that which 
Imost value, because all learning is ever made in that language. ” 
Modern literature was only just emerging into life, after the 
long darkness of the middle ages; and a certain flavor of bar- 
Darism and rudeness was held to belong to it. Chaucer and 
Dante had written, but it would not have occurred to any 
scholar of the sixteenth century to suppose that such books 
would repay critical analysis jn the same sense as Homer or 
Ovid. Nearly all the literary wealth of the world, as it then
-P-A-G-E-215
: 214 The Study of Language 
  
was, was embodied in the language of Greece or that of ancient 
Rome. 
Another reason for studying these languages was that they 
Their gram- were the only languages whose grammar had been 
formulated and reduced to a system. Each of 
these languages was nearly homogeneous, with very few foreign 
ingredients. Each possessed an claborate system of inflections 
and grammatical forms; and each had become a dead language 
—had ceased to be spoken popularly, and therefore to be sub- 
ject to the sort of corruption which goes on in the case of a 
tongue freely used by an unlearned people. Both languages 
therefore presented examples of organized and philosophic 
grammar, and a fixed literature, in which the laws of gram- 
matical structure were well exemplified and could be easily 
studied. On the other hand, the languages of modern Europe 
were heterogeneous, full of anomalies, subject to phonetic de- 
cay, and in a constant state of fluctuation. No attempt had 
been made to fix their forms, to find out what grammatical 
Jaws were still recognizable in them, and they therefore offered 
little attraction or advantage to the student of language. 
And besides all this, Latin, though a dead language for 
s ordinary colloquial purposes, was an eminently 
pnee & served living and vigorous language for many of the pur- 
poses recognized by a scholar. It had been ac- 
cepted as the universal language of the Western Church. It 
was the common medium of communication among the eccle- 
siastics and among the scholars of Europe. Not only Bede and 
the earlier chroniclers, but Sir T. More, Buchanan, Bacon, 
Hobbes, Milton, and Newton found Latin the most appropriate 
ebannel for communicating their thoughts both to foreign 
scholars and to the educated of their own countrymen. 
It is manifest that some of these reasons have either ceased to 
Nolonger exist altogether, or have receded very much as to 
served. their relative importance. It cannot now be said 
that all. the wisest and fairest productions of the buman intel- 
Ject are to be found in the Greek and Latin languages. A rich

modern literature has sprung up. Many entirely new studies 
have come into existence. There is the science of historic 
criticism; there are new developments of mathematical science; 
there is the whole of the wonderful field of physical investiga- 
tion; the modern languages, including our own, have become 
the subjects of philological and critical inquiry; and mean- 
while the duration of human life has not been materially ex- 
tended. It is evident, when we compare the books which are 
worth reading, and the subjects which can be studied to-day, 
with the books and the knowledge which were accessible in 
the days of Elizabeth, that the place occupied by Greek and 
Latin literature, however honorable, is relatively far less im- 
portant than it was. This is now recognized by the ancient 
Universitics themselves. The institution of the Law and Modern 
History schools at Oxford, and of the Natural Science Tripos 
and the Moral Science 'Tripos at Cambridge, are practical ad- missions that the word ‘“lIcarning” must be extended in its 
meaning; and that, e.g., an accomplished student of Natural 
Science, who knows little or no Greek, is as much entitled .to 
tank as a scholar and to receive honorable recognition from the 
University, as a good Greek scholar who knows little or nothing 
of Natural Science. . 
And it is important also to remember that Latin has ceased 
to serve the purpose it once fulfilled of a common Latin no 
medium of communication among scholars. A longer the 
modern Newton would not write his Principia in "ans of 
Latin. Our Sovereigns have no longer, as Crom- fion between 
weil had, a Latin secretary. Nor would any con- 
temporary of ours who wished to vindicate the political action 
of the English people in the eyes of foreign nations carry on a 
controversy in the language employed by Milton and Salma- 
sius, The occasions on which any educated Eng- orto any 
lishman, who is not a College tutor, or who does great exte 
not take up learning as a profession, is called on ment of

read Latin books with more or less ease ; they catch the flavor 
of the Augustan literature and the spirit of the Roman world, 
but the language which Tully and Horace spoke is no longer 
to them an instrument of thought, 
Nevertheless there is still a lingering and very potent tradi- 
Yet itis stiy tion, stronger even in our Grammar Schools than 
four ie. in the Universities themselves, that Latin and 
er iustruc- Greek are in some way the staple of a gentleman’s 
tion. education ; that he who has them and nothing else 
can claim to be called a scholar, and that he who has much 
other culture, and varied knowledge in other departments, and 
who has had no classical training, is au inferior being. It is not 
difficult to account for this sentiment. The men who make 
the public opinion of the country on these matters are for the 
most part those whose early education was carried out on this 
theory. One naturally values that which once knows best. 
Down deep in the mind of the successful statesman, the clergy- 
Ian, or man of letiers, who looks back on his years of toil 
over the Latin Accidence and the Greek Lexicon there is the 
half-expressed conviction, ‘The system must have been a good 
one because it produced me.” It is very difficult for a man in 
later life to divest his mind of all the associations which give a 
certain dignity to the thought of a classical education, or to ask 
himself what might have been done with his faculties if they 
had been otherwise trained. Now and then a man has the 
boldness to put this question to himself, and the answer is not always satisfactory. Listen to Wordsworth’s reminiscences of his College days. I was, he says,

The testimony accumulated by the Schools Inquiry Commis- 
sion of 1866 was conclusive not only as to the prev- 414 often

supreme efficacy of Latin and Greek as means of of result. 
mental training, but also as to the worthlessness of much of the 
Tesult, and the heavy price we have paid in England for the 
maintenance of the Grammar School theory. It constantly hap- 
pened to me when engaged as Assistant Commissioner on that 
inquiry to find an ancient Grammar School with 50 boys, of 
whom three fourths had begun the Latin Grammar, about ten 
were learning the delectus, some four or five in the highest, 
class of the school were translating Casar, and one or at most 
two at the head of the School were reading Virgil and elemen- 
tary Greek, and gave some promise that they might perhaps go 
to the University. And an occasional success in preparing a 
boy for matriculation encouraged the master and trustees in 
describing this as a thoroughly classical school, and caused 
them to forget that at least 48 out of the 50 would never go to 
the University, and would never learn enough of Latin or of 
Greek to be able to read even a simple author. Meanwhile for 
the sake of the “Classics” which had absorbed all their time 
they had been allowed to remain wholly ignorant of mathe- 
matics, they knew absolutely nothing of physical science, of 
French or German, or of the structure of their own language : 
they wrote, and even spelt, badly, and were often in point of 
general knowledge inferior to the children of a National 
School. 
This state of things is being slowly mended ; and there can 
be little doubt that, ere long, all schools of this kind will have 
been modernized and improved. Other subjects are asserting 
their right to recognition ; and perhaps the danger is that in the 
wholesome reaction against a state of opinion which gave to 
Latin and Greek an exclusive and hurtful predominance in a 
school course, we may come to make exactly the opposite mis- 
take of unduly depreciating them. Meanwhile it is worth 
while for us to make up our minds on this question. What—

having regard to the present boundaries of human knowledge 
and to the claims of modern life—is the right place for the 
ancient languages to hold, in a system of liberal education ? 
The answer to this question appears to me to depend entirely 
The future on the considerations which I tried to insist on in 
/ place of Latin the second lecture, and particularly an the length 
schools. of time which the student will probably devote to 
his course of instruction. You should keep in view roughly 
the three classes of learners—those who are likely to enter the 
Universities, and to aim at something like finished scholarship ; 
those whose course of instruction will probably not be pro- 
longed beyond 16 or 17 and who may be presumed to enter 
professions soon after ; and those who only receive primary in- 
struction ending at 13 or 14, Latin has indeed its relations to 
ali three. But it is not Latin for the same purpose, or to be 
taught by the same methods. In an interesting and suggestive 
Paper by Professor Ramsay, in Aacmillan’s Magazine, you will 
find that he would treat all these classes alike. Latin, he says, 
ought to be taught from the first as a living language. You 
are to aim at the power of varied expression and spontaneous 
thought by the help of Latin; you must learn the grammar 
very thoroughly, compose and recompose idiomatic phrases, 
long before you attempt to read an author. And all this he would seem to recommend alike for the boy who means to taake scholarship the business of his life, and for the children 
of the Burgh and parish schools, But surely the reasons 
which justify the learning of Latin are so different in the dif- ferent cases, that the same methods are not applicable to them ail.

ly or unconsciously from classical sources; considering too the 
admitted value, the literary and artistic finish of the best books 
which have come down to us, it is evident that we shall sus- 
tain a great loss if ever this mine of wealth ceases to be ex- 
plored or if we come to disregard it. And we may hope too 
that there will always be some students in England so devoted 
to the study of the ancient literature, that they wi!l not neglect 
what may be called the niceties and elegancies, the refinements 
and luxuries of Greck and Latin scholarship. Even for these 
it may well be doubted whether Latin is ever likely to be used, 
as Professor Ramsay would have it, as a medium for free ex- 
pression, or intellectual intercourse. It is only in a very limited 
sense that, even for them, Latin ought to be regarded as a liv- 
ing language. But we may admit that for them the training 
in versification and in Greek and Latin composition, to which 
so many years were devoted in the old grammar schools, has a 
meaning and a, value. And in the sixth form of a public 
school, and in the case of all who are likely to reach it and to 
proceed to the Universities, let us by all means accept the 
University standard and work towards it. It is not within my 
province now to criticise that standard, or to say how you are 
to attain it. But I will ask you to consider the case of those to 
whom this ideal is unattainable, and to inquire what part the 
study of Latin ought to play in their education. 
For those scholars who, when at the University, are likely to 
select mathematics, natural science, or modern (2) In Mod- 
subjects as their special subjects, and for the far or, Secon 
larger number who are never likely to proceed to dle Schools. 
the University, but who will enter professional or other active 
life at 16 or 17, the attempt to teach versification and the nice- 
ties of scholarship, or even to teach Greek at all, generally 
proves to be a mistake, for the reasons which have been already 
given, of which the chief is that the studies are not carried on 
to the fruit-bearing stage. Yet for such pupils, Latin has a 
real value. It can do much for them if the purpose with which 
it should be taught is carefully defined and kept in view.
-P-A-G-E-221

The substantial difference in the teaching of Latin to such 
Ob to pupils is that here you want them to read the 
be kept in language, but not to write it. You wish to famil- 
view. iarize them with the works of a few of the easier 
and more valuable Latin authors, and to understand their con- 
tents. And besides, and even above this, you teach Latin to 
this class of pupils; (1) because in it you find the best practical 
illustration of the science of grammar and the laws and struc- 
ture of language generally; (2) because it furnishes an éffective 
instrument for examining the history, formation, affinities, and 
development of the English language, and (8) because it helps 
toexplain much that would otherwise be obscure in our 
national literature, and to make intelligible the relation in which. 
this literature stands to that of Greece and Rome. 
Now if these be the main objects contemplated, it will follow 
Howtobe that much of the most laborious part of the ortho- 
attained. dox Latin teaching in the grammar and public schools becomes, if not superfluous, of very secondary import- 
ance. These objects are attainable, within a very reasonable 
amount of time and without encroaching on the domain of other 
learning, And when it is once understood that they are worth attaining, it becomes evident that they are just as important in 
Schools for girls as in those for boys. The tacit assumption in our old school plans that somehow Latin was a masculine and French a feminine study, is wholly indefensible. Both lan- guages ought to be taught as essential parts of every school course which is likely to be prolonged to the age of sixteen, and unless it is likely to be prolonged beyond that age, more than these two languages ought not to be attempted. 
And bearing in mind that the main reason for teaching Latin By cong is because of its reflex action on the understanding 
comparison of English, it is well from the first to teach the two 
ug Languages together. A few elementary lessons on 
Poglist the necessary parts of an English sentence, and on 
the classification of English words, should precede 
the introduction of a pupil to the Latin grammar; but after such

Comparison of Latin and English Forms. 221 
  
lessons ‘have been well understood, it seems to me desirable to 
teach the two grammars together, comparing at every step 
English constructions and idioms with those of Latin, After 
all we must remember that the knowledge of grammar as a 
science is to be had, not from the study of any one language per 
se, but from the comparison and synthesis of two or more lan 
guages, It is not till we have seen the differences and the resem- 
blances in the structure of two distinct grammars, that we can 
get the least perception of the difference between those princi- 
ples which are accidental or distinctive of particular tongues, 
and those which are fundamental and common to all organized 
languages alike. 
For instance, how much clearer the nature of the difference 
between Personal and Demonstrative pronouns will be, if by 
some such table as that which follows, you point out (@) that 
our own language once recognized this distinction as clearly as 
the Latin, (6) that we have retained in modern use only those 
forms which are printed in capitals, and (¢) that in the third 
person we have lost the plural forms of the Personal pronoun, 
and also most of the singular forms of the Demonstrative, and 
have pieced together the fragments, so as to make what we Dow 
call one pronoun, of which he, she, and it are the singular, and 
they and. theér the plural forms.

ing trensla- This is now recognized by all the best writers of

‘om thefirst, important is often lost sight of by teachers. ‘They 
‘say, and quite truly, ‘““We must have our scholars well 
grounded in the grammar first of all.” But their notion of 
grounding consists in requiring a great deal of the grammar to 
be learned by heart, before it is understood or seen in any 
practical application tothe actual construction of sentences. 
It is for this reason that the study is felt to be so dry and re- 
pulsive to school-boys. 
‘We repel a scholar by foreing him to learn at the beginning 
the whole list of inflections and conjugations, containing many form and distinctions of which he sees neither the meaning ror the use, and which he will not want for a long time to come, . All such synopses are useful and indeed indispensable; but they

should be reserved for a later period of the study when they will serve to collect and classify the knowledge which has been 
gradually acquired. With this view many good teachers ob- 
ject even to give the whole set of inflections in a noun to be 
learned by heart; but prefer to give a separate lesson on the 
genitive, or the accusative, to point out its various modifications 
and its exact meaning, and then to give a number of illustrative 
examples at once, so that theory and practice should go to- 
gether from the first. Consider the difference-in importance, 
and in immediate usefulness, between the accusative and the 
vocative case, consider how much more important the second 
declension is than the fourth, and you will then see how absurd is the method which obliges a boy to commit all these things to memory together at the same stage of his career. It is shock- ing to think of the heedless and unscientitic use which maby 
teachers have made of the mere verbal memory in treating this 
subject, keeping boys two or three years learning a great many 
bare abstractions, before allowing them to make any practical 
use of their knowledge or read single line. It needs to be constantly repeated that memory is a faculty of association 
mainly, and that words and names without useful associations 
are of no value, and are soon rejected by a healthy intelligence. 
The portion of the Latin grammar which, for How much 
the purpose now in view, requires to be thus of eer

(1) The five declensions, including of course all adjectives 
and participles. Here of course you will not separate nouns 
from adjectives, and so go over the same forms twice. You 
will show from the first the identity of the inflections in the 
two. 
(2) The rules for gender, with one or two of the most notable 
exceptions, 1 . 
(8) The four conjugations of verbs active and passive, with 
the substantive verb esse. _ 
(4) The irregular verbs 2olo, eo, nolo, malo, and possum.

(5) Three or four of the leading rules cf syntax, and these 
only, when the time comes for applying them. 
The simple rule of concord, between nominative and verb, 
and between noun and adjective, will come very early. Do 
not attempt to disjoin syntax and accidence as if syntax were 
an advanced part of the study. 
And from the first, as sentences are formed, I would call at- 
tention to the corresponding form in English, or to the absence 
in English of some inflection which is present in Latin, and to 
the expedients by which in our language we supply the lack of 
a more complete accidence and inflection. 
Many of the best teachers adopt the crude-form system of 
The crude- teaching the Latin and Greek accidence, They 
form system. all attention to the stem of the word—to that part 
which is common to all forms, and is independent of the in- 
flection, and they show how this stem is clothed with one garb 
after another, according to the use which has to be made of it. 
Such teachers would not speak of rez as the root for king, but 
veg, and would show how this root was disguised in the nomi- 
native case; nor porto, portare, to carry, but port; nor xovs for 
foot but 706; nor zpaéow but mpay. 
“ Ancient languages,” said Lord Bacon, ‘‘ were more full of 
declensions, cases, conjugations, tenses, and the like: the mod- 
ern commonly destitute of these do loosely deliver themselves 
in many expressions by prepositions and auxiliary verbs: may 
it not be conjectured that the wits of former times were far 
more acute and subtle than ours are?” 
‘We must not I think accept this inference too readily. For 
indeed the fact of the decay of inflections and of the substitu- 
tion for them of prepositions and auxiliaries, may be accounted 
for on many other hypotheses than that of a decline in human 
acuteness, or in intellectual exactitude. Yet it is plain that by 
pointing out at each stage in learning the Latin grammar the 
difference between a given modification in the meaning of a word as expressed, say by an ablative in Latin, and by a@ pre- position in English; by a future tense in Latin, and by the

  word. shali or will in English; you are giving to the pupil a 
truer notion of the functions of grammar and the extent of its 
province than if you taught either of these forms by itself. 
As to the vocabulary, I think we often put needless difficul- 
ties in the way by requiring every word to be sepa- ‘The Vo- 
rately hunted out in a dictionary. This isa very C#bulary. 
slow and wearisome process, and after all there is no particular 
value in it, It does nothing to encourage accuracy, and it 
certainly does not help to give any special love for the act of 
research. So in all early exercises it is well to bring the voca- 
bulary specially needed in those exercises close under the eye 
of the learner so that he has not far to look for them. Later 
of course it is very desirable that he should know how to con- 
sult a dictionary, and should often use it; but if he has to make 
this reference in more, say, than one in ten of the words which 
occur in his lesson you are placing a needless impediment in 
the way of his progress, 
Again, it is desirable that as soon as possible you escape from 
the little graduated exercises in what may be 
called manufactured Latin;—the sort of Arnoldian Yseeen0- 
exercise in which ‘Balbus strikes the head of the sentences, not those father of the maiden;”—and get to real sentences, manufac- 
little narratives which have an interest of their Bee ter so. 
own, and which are taken from good authors. 
Of course these should be so graduated, that the difficulties do 
not come all at once. But it is better to deal with a short pas- 
sage, or a verse of an ode, which has a prettiness and interest of 
its own, even though there are one or two phrases in it a Hitle 
beyond the reach of the learner’s present grammatical know- 
ledge, than to keep him too long on bald and meaningless sen- 
tences, merely because they illustrate a particular kind of 
grammar rule, , 
After a little progress has been made, a teacher may wisely 
select an easy ode of Horace, some passages from Ovid; the 
sentences from Cxsar descriptive of his visit to Britain; a few 
of the happier examples of characterization from the Catiline of

Sallust, or some eloquent sentences from an oration of Cicero; 
and will make these first of all the subject of thorough gram- 
matical investigation, postponing, however, any special difficul- 
ties and promising to recur to them hereafter. Then he will 
give a full explanation of the meaning, circumstances, and pur- 
pose of the extract, and finally after it has been translated care- 
fully, will cause it to be learned by heart. This was Jacotot’s 
method. Tout est dams tout, He required that some one inter- 
esting passage should be dealt with exhaustively, and should 
be made not only a specimen of the way in which a passage 
might be investigated, but a centre round which grammatical 
knowledge might cluster, and to which all new acquisitions 
might be referred by way of comparison or contrast. Nothing 
is more depressing and unsatisfactory than to arrange all au- 
thors in the order of their supposed difficulty, and to say, e.g. 
that one must spend so many months over Eutropius, and then 
another term on Cesar, and afterwards proceed to Ovid and to 
Virgil, as if these books represented so many advanced rules in 
Arithmetic. A child properly taught Latin with the object E 
have indicated, should above all things be interested and made 
from the first to feel that the Latin language is like his own in 
the variety and attractiveness of its contents, and not a series of 
exercises in grammar and vocabulary only. 
For after all, one of your chief aims in teaching language at 
Literature 21 is to make the scholar enjoy literature, and get

. words, The sooner we can bend our teaching 
towards these particular purposes the better. 
One way of doing this will be to study some English classic

‘We have spoken of the simultaveous study of Latin and Eng- 
lish Grammar. There is an equally good reason for the simul- 
taneous reading of Latin and English literature. Side by side 
‘with the Latin lessons, or alternating with them, I would take good sentences from Classical English books and treat them in the same way. In the one'lesson you will notc down all Latin

words which have supplied English derivatives, in the other all 
English words which have a Latin origin. You will make a 
list of them, i}lustrate their meaning and use, the way in which 
some portions of the original meaning have disappeared, and 
other shades or varictics of signification have become attached 
to the words since their introduction into English, By requir- 
ing these words to be collected in a special list you will at the 
same time be increasing your pupil’s store of Latin words and will make him more accurately acquainted with the history and 
significance of words in his own language. Constant care should also be taken to secure that resemblances or differences 
in the idiom and structure of the two languages should be Clearly apprehended, and free use should be made of note-books 
in order to promote thoroughness and accuracy. And as the pa- 
pil becomes further advanced, it is well to take up the parallel 
and simultancous study of portions of an ancient and a modern 
author, e.g. with the Ars Poetica of Horace Pope’s Essay on 
Criticism or Byron’s Hints from Horace might be read; with a Satire of Juvenal, Johnson’s imitation or some well-chosen 
Passage from Dryden; with an oration of Cicero, a famous 
speech of Burke or Macaulay; with one of the Georgics of 
Virgil, an extract from Thomson or Cowper descriptive of 
rural life; with a passage from Livy or Tacitus, another pas- 
sage from Gibbon or Froude. 
This is a large subject, and uo one of you can be more con- 
scious than I am of the inadequacy of such few hints as can 
be given on it ina short lecture. Those of you who are en- 
gaged in teaching Latin or Greek, will find it necessary te 
read much and to think more, before you will attain a satis- 
factory course of procedure. By far the wisest and most sug- 
gestive of old books on the methods of teaching is Roger As- 
cham’s Sckolemaster, which explains fully his system of teach- 
ing by translation and re-translation. He would go through a 
Latin passage and translate it into English, writing the transla- 
tion down carefully; then after an interval of an hour or two,
-P-A-G-E-229
          228 The Study of Language. 
  he would give the scholar those English sentences for re-trans- 
lation into Latin, and as he well shows, whether this be done 
by memory or by invention it is almost equally useful. I 
strongly advise also the reading of Mr. Quick’s admirable book 
on Educational Reformers, for that work not only summarizes 
well the main exccllencies of Ascham’s method, but it. also 
gives an account of the methods of teaching Latin recom- 
mended by Milton, by Comenius, by Locke, and by others— 
subjects which it is beyond my province to discuss here. Nor 
ought I to omit the mention of Mr. Henry Sidgwick’s thought- 
ful paper in the Essays on a Liberal Education, and of Mr. 
D’Arcy Thompson’s Day-dreams of a Schoolmaster, which is 
full of practical suggestion as tc rational and simple means of 
teaching grammar. 
In what I have said hitherto we have been chiefly concerned 
The place of with the use which should be made of Latin in 
Hatin ina secondary schools. And this, as we have seen, 
School. does not aim at making what are called ‘“schol- 
ars,” nor at using Latin as a vehicle for the expression of the 
learner’s own thoughts, but mainly at enabling him to under- 
stand the laws of language, and especially of his own-lan- 
guage, better. Now what is the place, if any, which Latin 
should hold in a Primary school or in one whose course will 
probably terminate at 14? 
There has been much contention as to the expediency of in- 
cluding in the Schedule of additional “Specific Subjects,” 
attached to the Code of the Education Department, lessons on 
the elements of Latin Grammar. By some this is defended on 
the grounds that such knowledge will be serviceable to those 
promising scholars whom it may be worth while to encourage 
| to go forward to a secondary school, and that in the open com- 
petition for admission to such schools Latin grammar is often 
one of the required subjects. But the truth is that at the age 
' of 12 or 18, at which it is fitting to select such a pupil for an 
exhibition, Latin ought not to be required at all. It is of far 
more importance to secure that his intelligence shall have been

quickened by the ordinary discipline of a good primary school, 
than that he should have been exceptionally trained for the 
exhibition, and he will learn Latin all the better and faster in 
the higher school for having received such discipline. More- 
over the Primary school has no right to sacrifice the interests 
of the mass of its scholars to those of the exhibitioner; and in 
the interests of the mass, it is impossible to defend the teach- 
ing of a few fragments of Latin grammar which have no rela- 
tion to anything else they are learning, or are likely to learn. 
So I do not think it wise in Elementary Schools to attempt 
the formal study of Latin. But there is a sense in which the 
language has claims which should not be disregarded even 
here. Some lessons should be given showing that there is 
a Latin language, explaining who used to speak it, and how 
and why so many of our words are derived from it. Even in 
the humblest school-course the fact that other languages exist, 
and that there are many ways of expressing the same notion, 
ought to be understood. Then it is well to teach a few of the 
simpler tests by which words of Latin origin may be identified . 
by terminations or otherwise; and to explain the more common 
of the phonetic changes which words undergo in becoming 
English. These should not be presented in the form of a list 
or table, but be brought out by induction from examples, of 
which some may be suggested by the teacher, but the most 
supplied by the scholars, 
The Etymology of many Latinized words might be advan- 
tageously explained. But here a good deal of poivations 
caution is needed. Tell a scholar who is not of English

and mitto I send, or perceive from per and capio, or obedience 
from ob and audire, and you have simply given him a showy 
and unmeaning piece of knowledge, and rather hindered than 
helped his conception of the real significance of the English 
derivative. The only words in relation to which the mere 
learning of the Latin etymology by itself secures. any useful 
purpose, are words like submarine or soliloguy, where the

etymology brings out the meaning without the least ambiguity. 
But if you will take the trouble to show by a few examples 
what.changes and modifications of meaning Latin words have 
often undergone in the process of becoming English, the 
etymological exercise will have a real value. In particular 
you will find it useful to trace out the changes by which words 
which have at first a literal and physical meaning come in time 
to have a metaphorical meaning. You take the word fortis 
and show it in fortress and afterwards in fortitude or comfort. 
So Morsel and remorse, Effigy and fiction, Image and imagina 
tion, Pound and ponder, Refract and infringe, Integer and 
integrity, give occasion for pointing out how the application of 
a word to some moral or spiritual truth is subsequent to its 
physical meaning, and that we may illustrate a moral truth by 
a physical image, but never a physical fact by an image drawn 
from the world of thought. A few of the most familiar Latin 
roots may then be taken, e.g. pose; and the pupils may be in- 
vited to supply words containing this syllable,—suppose, ex- 
‘pose, Aepose, interpose, repose, and to show what is the common 
element of meaning in all of them, 
Afterwards it is well to call attention to the double significa- 
Prefixes and tion of the Latin prefixes, to show, e.g. that they 
have a physical or prepositional meaning in some 
words, as in transport, invade, expel, emit, intercollegiate, re- 
gain, exéra-mural, perforate; and an adverbial or derived 
meaning as transfigure, incomplete, experience, eloquence, 
interjection, respect, extravagant, perish. In teaching these 
prefixes it is needful to show how inadequate a notion of their 
meaning is obtained by looking into a dictionary and simply 
taking their primitive signification as prepositions, without 
also taking into account their secondary meaning when they 
come to be used adverbially, in the composition of verbs. 
If in these ways, Latin—not its formal grammar, but a part of its vocabulary, and such facts about the language as serve to explain the structure and meaning of English words—be 
tecogtized as a subject of study in the primar 'y school, it will

  be found very stimulating and helpful to those who may after- 
wards have opportunities of Jearning more of the language; 
and at the same time, it will be of substantial value even to 
those who will enjoy no such opportunities, and is in no sense 
out of harmony with all else that is taught in the ordinary ele- 
mentary course.

if its grammar is taught side by side with that of English, and- 
made the subject of constant comparison and contrast. But 
the structure of French grammar does not furnish either com- 
parison or contrast quite so instructive as that of Latin for pur- 
poses of philological discipline, or for throwing light on the 
principles of grammar per se. The main reason for teaching 
French or German is that the learner may read books and con- 
verse in that language, and use it as an instrument of thought 
and communication, That therefore which is the Their special 
first and main object of teaching Latin—the in- PYrpose. 
vestigation of the logic of language, and the reflex action of its 
grammar on the structure of other languages and particularly 
of our own—is only the secondary and subordinate object to 
be kept in view in the teaching of French. And that which is 
the principal reason for learning French, viz. that we may be 
able to think, to speak, and to write in it, is not, for purposes 
of ordinary education, contemplated in the study of Latin at 
all. And it is only by keeping this fundamental difference in 
view that we can arrive at right methods of teaching either. . 
Obviously, some of the principles and methods already dis- 
cussed apply equally to Latin and French. Both How far they 
are foreign languages. In both we have to begin resemble 
at the beginning, to learn vocabulary as well as 
grammar. In both it is essential to begin with a few nouns, 
to attach them first to verbs, afterwards to adjectives, after

            232 The Study of Language. 
  
wards to other nouns in the various case-relationships. In both 
it is equally important that new rules should be learned only it 
and when they are wanted, and should be seen in their appli- 
cations and applied directly. In both there is the same neces- 
sity for kindling the interest of your scholar, by connecting the 
words he learns with living realities, with things and events 
within his comprehension. In both it is equally desirable to 
make constant reference to analogous usages and constructions 
in English. 
But besides this, it is from the first necéssary to treat French

careful on elementary sounds in French are the best helps to 
this, At first little familiar sentences are better. I have seen 
in one of the best schools in England what was called a “parrot 
class,” in which little girls were learning to utter French 
phrases and nursery rhymes, with the right pronunciation and 
inflection as a whole, and were told roughly what was the 
meaning of them. This is what is often called the Mastery 
System. By it children are not at first allowed to see French 
written, but are made to acquire a thoroughly French pronun- 
ciation and intonation parrotlike, before they begin to have 
their attention directed to the sounds of separate syllables, to 
the meaning of separate words and idioms, or to translation 
and re-translation. 
Such exercises are particularly useful. In talking we want

Boepere st tence without thinking of its particular parts, and rather than the laborious synthesis of the various elements of 
written. a sentence is, as we all know, a rather slow pro- 
cess, Some therefore of the early work of teaching a young class French ought to correspond to the way in which a little 
child learns English from its mother or its nurse, i.e. in little sentences which at first carry the whole meaning with them, and are not thought of as capable of analysis: For the special purpose contemplated in teaching French, the sooner the child

learns something which he feels a pleasure in committing to 
memory the better. - 
It is evident that talking in the language and learning by 
heart are much more important here than in Latin. No lesson 
in French which is confined to translation and reading is worth 
much, if it is not followed up by actual conversation, Even 
the simplest affirmative sentence admits of being turned into 
an interrogative, or furnishes the material for a question and 
answer of some kind, which however slightly varied, obliges 
the child to make the words his own. And unless the learner 
makes the words his own, and learns actually to use them, his 
progress is very unsatisfactory. Then we must remember that 
in seeking to get a store of vocables and words for use, it is not 
“a large number of nouns and adjectives which we want first, 
but a few familiar locutions, the phrases for asking, for assert- 
ing, for denying, for inquiring; into which phrases nouns and 
adjectives soon fit themselves as fast as they are known. Mr. 
Quick quotes from Marcel’s Study of Languages a very signifi- 
cant sentence, ‘‘ Half the knowledge with twice the power of 
applying it is better than twice the knowledge with half the 
power of application.”

forms of words as they are printed in a book suf- Latin for the

want to approach the understanding in this case. The ear and 
the voice have little or nothing to do with it; for scarcely any- 
body ever has occasion to use a single sentence of spoken 
Latin, or to listen to Latin and interpret it at the same time. 
But in French or German it is the ear and the voice we want 
to cultivate quite as much as the eye, and much therefore of 
every good French lesson should go on with the books closed.

  is obviously a simple and necessary exercise, and which of 
course you will not neglect. But even this does not suffice, 
for the measured careful utterance proper to a dictation lesson 
is very unlike ordinary speech, and many scholars will write a 
very good exercise from dictation, who would be quite unable 
to follow a conversation or even a sermon or oration delivered 
in the ordinary way. Is it not the painful experience of many 
of us who may be very familiar with book-French and able to 
read the language fluently, that when we once cross the Chan- 
nel, and hear it rapidly uttered, we are confused, and cannot 
follow it fast. enough. Here and there a word which happens 
to be the key-word or significant word in the sentence wholly 
rscapes us; and this causes the entire sentence to be unintel- 
ligible. We wonder why people will talk so fast, forgetting 
that our own habitual speech is often just as rapid, just as full 
of contractions and elisions; and that after all we do not know 
a language for speaking purposes unless we can think as fast 
as an ordinary person talks. Now the true remedy for this is 
constant exercise in listening either to reading or to speech, 
uttered at the rapid rate of ordinary conversation. And the: ‘ 
power to make a right use of such an exercise is far more easily 
attained when very young, and when the mind is unencum- 
bered by thoughts of analysis and grammar, than in later life, It should not therefore be postponed and treated as an advanced exercise, but frequently adopted from the beginning. 
Mr. Bowen, in an excellent Paper read at the late Head Mas- ters’ Conference, recommended that with advanced scholars the 
occasional use of a French book of reference ag an alternative 
for an English one is useful. He recommends reference to a good French gazetteer or dictionary, or to the Biographie Uns.

pooks in style and in clearness of arrangement. The sooner

ing a thing at first-hand, the more rapid will be the progress 
of your pupil. 
Some exercises in invention and arrangement are given in 
most of the books, but not, as it seems to me, pyorcises in 
enough. There are French sentences to be trans- invention and 
lated into English and English into French. But °™Posi#om 
there are not enough exercises in which learners are required 
to make stntences of their own. These however are very im- 
portant, At first a noun, and a verb, and an adjective may be 
given, in order that two or three little sentences may be made 
out of them; afterwards afew nouns may be given, and the pupil 
told to put at his own discretion appropriate verbs to them. 
Then verbs or adjectives may be added and required to be 
added to suitable nouns, Afterwards particular idioms or 
phrases may be given, and the pupil asked to construct sen- 
tences containing them.. Thus at first you give the material 
for such sentences—but little by little, less should be given, and 
the scholars should be required to discover and supply words 
for themselves. And whether the required words are supplied 
from memory, or are hunted out and selected from a book, the 
exercise is equally valuable. 
But although we thus dwell chiefly on the importance of the 
etter cultivation of the ear and voice in teaching a modern 
foreign language, since these are just the points we are most in 
danger of forgetting, book-work being’ always more easy and 
seductive to teachers than the kind of oral practice which 
makes constant demands on your skill, your promptitude, and 
your memory; we must not of course overlook the fact that the 
language has also to be written, and its grammar thoroughly 
understood. ‘You cannot therefore dispense with written exer- 
cises, especially in grammar and in composition, of the same 
Kind as you would find necessary in teaching Latin. These, 
however, are precisely the things which good modern books 
supply in great abundance. 
Lastly, a word may be said on the question of the teachers 
of foreign languages. It is generally considered indispensable

to have a Frenchman to teach French, and a German to 
The choice teach German. But experience shows us that 
of teachers. the power to speak French does not always co- 
exist with the power to teach il; that French ushers as a class 
are without the general liberal education which you look for in English assistants; and that as specialists, whose position ren- 
ders them unable to look on the school work as a whole, they 
often fail to secure authority, or even to secure full knowledge 
for their own subject. It is obvious too that most of them are 
ata great disadvantage in the explanation in English of the meaning of the rules, and especially in comparing French idioms with English. Accordingly, in some of the best schools the modern language masters preferred are scholarly English- men, who have lived for a time abroad, and who have learned 
French or German well enough to think and converse well in 
it. And where such teachers are to be had, I should be dis- 
posed to prefer them. The objection to this is that the pro- 
nunciation is not likely to be perfect. But it is very easy to 
overrate the importance of what is often so much vaunted in 
ladies’ schools, the purely Parisian accent, and to pay too 
heavy a price for it. After all, this accent is not the first thing 
an Englishman wants. He will acquire it- if he goes abroad; and if he never acquires it, the power to express himself and to derive pleasure from reading French or German literature is much more important,

and Greek are identical with those which make us teach French 
or German, but that others are wholly different; That Latin is 
to be learned as a literary language, and with a view to gram- 
matical and logical training mainly, and not for purposes of 
expression or intercourse; but That a modern language is 
learned mainly for the sake of expression and intercourse, and 
only incidentally and in a subordinate sense as a linguistic dis- 
cipline. The questions arise now—Why and how should we 
teach English, our own language? What place in a complete 
scheme of instruction should the vernacular tongue as a sepa- 
rate study be made to occupy? 
The answer to this question depends of course on the width 
and extent of your course, and on the nature of the other pro- 
vision which that course affords for prosecuting the study of 
grammar asa science, It has been said that the true percep- 
tion of that science is the result of the synthests and. ooo 
of two lan; s, and is well-nigh unattainable in the learning 
of one. For that reason, I have already urged that in the 
teaching of Latin or of French, continual reference should be made to analogous forms and constructions in English. And 
no doubt in schools in which other languages are taught in this 
way, much of English is learned incidentally by comparison,

analogy, and contrast, rather than in the form of intentional 
lessons on English, per se. 
It is mainly in this incidental and indirect way, that most 
AVE _ English scholars have come to learn their own lan- 
lar grammar guage, and have very often come to learn it well. 
fgmlcerned And hence it is not uncommon to hear English and inci grammar spoken of as if it were wholly useless, 
‘ally. and almost as if it were non-existent. And we 
are to inquire to-day whether this distrust of the value of con- 
scious and systematic instruction in English is well founded, or 
Whether such instruction can be made to serve a real educa- 
tional purpose. We know that in France and Germany the study of the vernacular tongue is treated with more respect than with ourselves; that in France especially, exercises in the structure, logical analysis, and composition of French occupy 
a good deal of attention even in schools in which other lan- 
suages are taught; and that it is probably to this cause we may 
attribute the greater ease and skill with which as a rale a 
Frenchman uses his own language, as compared with an Eng- lishman of corresponding educational standing and advantages. 
The study of our own tongue appears to deserve more respect- ful treatment than it receives even in our higher schools. It certainly is a valuable, indeed an indispensable educational in- strument in Primary schools, in which no other language is taught.

direct process, The direct operation and use of grammar rules 
in improving our speech and making it correct, can hardly be 
said to exist at all.

way consciously guided to correct speech by a knowledge of 
grammatical rules, They have learned to use their own lan- 
guage by using i, by imitation and habit, and by the fine in- 
tuition which has led them to imitate good models rather than 
bad. If the “art of speaking and writing the English language 
with propriety” is the one thing contemplated by learning | 
grammar, the ordinary means are very imperfectly adapted to 
the end; for the study of grammar from a scholastic text-book, | 
even if the whole of it is learned from beginning to end, is very 
little helpful in improving the pupil’s speech and writing. The 
faults which occur in specch, the confusions, the clumsy con- | 
structions, the misuse of words, and their mispronunciation, 
are not as a rule sins against grammar, properly so called, and 
are not to be set right by learning English accidence or syntax. 
The rules given in books have little or no practical value. For 
instance, “ Transitive verbs and prepositions govern the objec- 
tive case.” What does this mean? In English nouns there is 
no objective case distinguishable from the nominative at all. 
In pronouns there are four or five survivals of old datives, 
which now serve both as dative and accusative, and may there- 
fore be called objective. They are me, thee, him, her, them, and 
whom. And the rale in question amounts to an injunction that 
we should use these six words in their proper places, and not 
say, “Give I the book,” or, ‘‘Send the money to fe.” But 
these are faults which the most ignorant child is in no danger 
of committing, and against which no warning is needed. Con- 
sidered therefore as a means of regulating our speech, this and 
the like rules are utterly valueless. . . 
If therefore we have in view mainly the practical art of using
-P-A-G-E-241
240 : The English Language.   
the language in speech or writing with good taste and correct- 
ness, this particular result is probably best to be attained by 
talking to the pupil, by taking care he hears little but good 
English, by correcting him when he is wrong, by making him 
read the best authors, by practising him much in writing, and 
when he makes a mistake, by requiring him to write the sen- 
tence again without one. It will certainly not be attained 
by setting him to learn Murray’s, or indeed any other grammar. 
Grammar, however, is a science as well as an art, and from 
Grammar as this point of view it investigates the structure of 
* language, the history and formation of words, and 
the manner in which the mechanism of grammatical form is 
fitted to fulfil the great end of language—the just, subtle, and 
forcible expression of human thought.!. And if a book on 
grammar will help me to this end, and will reveal to me the 
Jaws and principles which underlie and account for the epeech 
which I am using every day, then the study of such a book 
will have a scientific value for me quite apart from any prac- 
tical help which it may give in avoiding solecisms, and in 
“speaking grammatically” as it is called. Such study of 
grammar, though it seems rather to have a theoretic than a 
practical character, will incidentally serve the purpose of mak- 
ing the speech more correct. If, however, that. purpose is con- 
templated as the first which is to be served in teaching, we not 
only shall not attain it, but we shall fail altogether to achieve ‘the much higher ends which may be reached by the teaching of grammar as a science,

alphabet is printed on the first page, and duly classified into 
vowels, consonants, semi-vowels, and diphthongs. Then he is 
conducted to Etymology, and to the separate study of words, 
which he is called on to classify and decline. Then comes 
Syntax, when he is invited to deal with sentences, and the rela- 
tion of their parts, and to learn rules of concord and of govern- 
ment. Finally, he reaches Prosody, under which head he finds 
punctuation, metre, and other grammatical luxuries. 
But long before a child comes to the commencement of sucha 
book, he has learned to speak, and to use his native « vernacular 
tongue. He knows the meaning of sentences, and language 
he thinks by means of the language. That which taught by 
is in teaching French the ultimate goal of your vee. 
ambition, conversation and freedom in using words, is the very 
point of departure in the case of your own vernacular speech. 
Your pupil has already attained it. Hence the methods of 
teaching a native and a foreign language are fundamentally 
different. The slow, synthetical process appropriate in the one 
case, of beginning with words—in the case of German and 
Greek, even with the alphabet,—and building up at first short 
sentences, then longer sentences, is wholly illogical and absurd 
in the case of the other. Toa child-a sentence is easier than a 
word, the cognition of a word is easier than that of a syllable 
as a separate entity; and the syllable itself is something easier 
than the power or significance of a single letter. And hence 
the way to teach English grammar is to begin with the sen- 
tence, because that is something known, and to proceed ana- 
lytically. If other languages are to be learned by synthesis, 
our own should be learned by the opposite process of analysis, 
and whereas we learn a foreign language through and by 
means of its grammar, we must learn and discover English 
grammar through and by means of the language. 
Grammar strictly defined is the logic of language in so far 
and in go far only as it finds expression in the inflections and 
forms of words. In Latin forms, you find this logic expressed 
with some fulness and scientific accuracy. In English it is 
16
-P-A-G-E-243
242 The English Language. 
  
expressed in an unscientific and very incomplete way. But 
the logic of language, which is the basis of all grammar, is 
discernible alike in both, and our business is to investigate 
that, whether it reveals itself fully in grammatical forms or 
not, . 
The main conclusions to which we have thus been led are 
four: (1) That of pure grammar there is very little in the 
English language. (2) That this little when discovered has 
scarcely any practical bearing on the improvement of our 
speech, (8) That nevertheless the study of the English lan- 
guage is worth pursuing, and if the expression “‘ English Gram- 
mar” be enlarged so as to connote exercises in the logic, bis- 
tory, formation and relation of words, it will designate one of 
the most fruitful and interesting of school studies; and (4) That 
whatever is to be learned of a vernacular language, must be 
Jearned by the method of analysis, and not by the synthetic pro- 
cess, which is proper in studying a foreign tongue. 
‘We may now apply these conclusions in succession to several 
of the most useful forms of English exercise. 
One of your earliest lessons consists of a view of the parts of 
Classifica.  Specch. The books would have you begin by say- 
tion. ing there are nine of them, and by requiring the 
pupil to learn by heart the definition and some examples of 
each, But it is surely a much more rational method to begin 
with a sentence which the scholar already understands, and so 
to draw from him the simple facts that in using language there 
are two essential conditions, viz., — 
(1) That we should have something to talk about; 
) That we should have something to say. 
‘You may illustrate this by taking a little sentence 
The child sleeps 
asa type, and you say that the former word is called the Sub- 
ject or the thing talked about, and is a Noun, and the latter the Predicate, the thing said, and isa Verb, 
i . .
-P-A-G-E-244
Classification of English Words. 243 
  
Then you point out that each of these words admits of exten- 
sion, and takes an attribute; 
The litile child sleeps soundly, 
and you show that the one word enlarges the subject and the 
other the predicate. You then invite the scholars to give you 
other sentences containing the same elements, and after a few examples you give names to the words which fulfil these two functions and call the one an Adjective and the other an Adverb, 
Then you seek to attach other notions to the first, and you 
do this in two ways: 
The child sleeps on the bed. 
The child sleeps because hg is tired. 
In the former case you have added a word, in the latter a new sentence, the nature of the connection thus established being shown by the word in italics. Ience is deduced the necessity for two sorts of connective words, the Preposition which attaches a noun, and the Conjunction which attaches a sentence to what has gone before. . These are the six essential elements of organized speech, and the logical order of their importance is 
Subject. .  .  .  . Noun. 
Predicate . . . . Verb. 
Adjunct to Subject . . Adjective. 
“ Predicate. . Adverb. 
Connective of Word .  . Preposition. 
“ Sentence . Conjunction. 
Then you go on to show that you have not exhausted all the 
words in the language, but that there remain— 
(1) The Pronoun, whose use you illustrate by examples. It 
is not a new clement in language, but is simply used as a con- 
venient substitute for a noun in certain cases. . 
(2) The Article, which is seen to be a kind of adjective used 
in a very special sense. 
 
-P-A-G-E-245
244 The English Language. 
You show that these two though useful are not indispensa- 
ble, and that Latin did without the last altogether. 
Lastly you point out that what is often called the ninth part 
of speech, the Interjection, is in fact not a part of speech at all; 
but as Horne Tooke called it ‘the miserable refuge of the 
speechless.” It is the one form of human utterance which 
obeys no Jaw, and is closest akin to the screams of a bird, or to 
the growling of a dog; and we never use it unless fora moment 
we part with the privilege of humanity, descend to the level of 
the lower animals, and cease to use organized language alto- 
gether. 
Now ali this could be well taught with varied illustrations 
in three lessons, and the outcome of it would show itself in 
some such black-board sketch or summary as this:

Definitions of Parts of Speech. 245 
A verb of complete predication is Intransitive; one which makes an 
incomplete assertion is Transitive. 
Pronouns which have in them a connective element of meaning are 
called Relatives. 
So that instead of beginning with the definitions I should end 
with them, The process is one of induction and analysis from 
the first. You begin with the concrete whole—a sentence with 
which learners are already familiar, you work down to its 
parts, you seek to discriminate them carefully; then, and not 
til then, you give them names, and finally by way of clinching 
your lesson you ask for the meanings of those names, and after 
a few experiments of the Socratic kind, may succeed in evolv- 
ing a good definition of each. In doing this explain if you like 
the significance of the name. But this is not always easy, and 
when easy not always helpful. Our grammatical terminology 
is so arbitrary, that an etymological inquiry into the meaning 
of the words Preposition, Infinitive, Adjective, will rather mis- 
lead than otherwise, 
At this point you will find how useful it is to give examples 
illustrative of the way in which the same word may be used in 
very different ways: e.g. 
(1) Rest comes to the weary. They rest from their labors. 
(2) Light is diffused by reflection. This isa light room. They light 
the candle. 
(8) Reading is a useful art. They have been reading an hour, She 
has a reading book. 
By a few tentative sentences of this kind you will show that 
it is impossible to label a word with a name while it stands 
alone, that in fact it is not a part of speech at all until it is seen 
inasentence. Follow this up by asking such @ question as 
this; “take the word Sound and put it into a sentence so that 
it shall be a noun—an adjective—a verb.” Much exercise in 
the making of sentences to illustrate each new distinction as it 
is pointed out, is indispensable. 
You go back then to the Noun, the Adjective, and the Adzerd,
-P-A-G-E-247

and show that though each is generally expressed by one word, 
each may be expanded into a phrase or sentence which is 
equivalent to it. 
E.g. (t) The rainbow appears - . +  « Simple noun.

value. It is not grammar, it is true; it is rather elementary

Logical Analysis. 247 
  Some sentences contain only one or two elements, and may 
be dismissed in two lines, Others require the statement of many 
more particulars than are provided for in sucha diagram. The 
essential points in relation to the analysis are (1) That an ac- 
count shall be given of every separate logical element in the 
sentence; (2) That the meaning and force of each of the con- 
nective words which are not strictly in the sentence but which 
indicate the character of subordinate sentences, shall be de- 
scribed; and (8) That the relation of the several senteaces to 
each other whether as co-ordinate or subordinate shall also be 
clearly shown. ‘These conditions will be found to be fulfilled 
in the example on the next page. 
After some exercises of this kind in logical parsing, or con- currently with them, it is useful to give the ordi- gram. 
nary drill in grammatical parsing. But here itis matical 
necessary to distinguish between the proper pro- ” vince of logic and that of pure grammar. For instance, the 
difference between Common and Proper nouns is the logical 
difference between universals and particulars, and has no place in grammar whatever. And the distinction of sex is in no 
sense logical, and in English is hardly grammatical. It deter- 
mines the form of our nouns and pronouns in only a very 
limited number of cases; and we have no conventional sex, as 
in Latin and French, which affects the concord of adjectives. 
Hence the enumeration of Gender among the attributes of Eng- 
lish words has little to do with Etymology and less with Syn- 
tax, and in fact serves no grammatical purpose at all.

Let me now give you an illustration of another kind of Jesson, in which, as indeed in all other inquiries into Eng- ‘Alesson on 
lish, a knowledge of the elements of Old Eng- Ausiliary lish Grammar will be of greathelpto you. Begin 
with a few examples of the use of Auxiliary verbs. You ob- 
serve that there is no inflectional provision for Perfect, Plu- 
perfect, or Future tense in English, nor for the Potential 
Mood, but these modifications of meaning are shown by auxil- 
iaries. The old grammars recognized a fundamental distinc- 
tion between this method and that of accidence. In Ben Jon- 
son’s Grammar for instance, you will find the statement that 
the English Language has no Future tense, but that its place is 
supplied by a Syntax. ‘With this in view, it is worth while to 
give several special lessons on the peculiar function and use of 
auxiliaries in English, And in doing this, you will choose 
first examples of the use of these words not as auxiliaries, but 
as principal and independent verbs. “ Before Abraham was I 
am.” Here the verb 2¢ is independent and means existence. 
Afterwards and in ordinary modern use, it pecs mere copula. “He was going, I am a soldier. gain OE &
-P-A-G-E-251
250 The English Language. 
  meaning of the word “have” is seen to be that of possession, 
the subsequent meaning that of completion. You show that 
“will” simply implies volition in such a sentence as “If I weld 
that he tarry till I come;” but that in the sentence ‘He w7t 
go,” it implies futurity. You ask why in merely stating a fact 
about a future act, you say ‘I shall come;” but “They weld 
come;” yet that if you desire to express the same thing with 
more positiveness you change the form and say “I ew,” and 
“They shall,” And having traced this usus ethicus by means 
of the analogous forms should and would, you come to the con- 
clusion that though these two words have come in time to be 
auxiliaries, some faint reminiscence of their early signification 
still clings to them, and that even in their modern use, we can 
discern traces of the idea of volition in will and would, and of 
obligation in shall and should. The same thing is seen on ex- 
amination to be true of all the auxiliary verbs. They have in 
becoming mere substitutes for inflection parted with much of 
their original meaning, but in all cases some flavor of that origi- 
nal meaning remains. The result of these inquiries may then 
be tabulated in some such form as this:

at first in the form of a list to be learned from 2 text-book, but 
should grow as the facts are elicited in successive lessons.

Such a series of inductive lessons having been given, lists of 
illustrative examples prepared, and sentences framed to contain 
each of the less familiar words, the pupil will know something 
of the genesis both of words and of thoughts, and will be able 
on looking at many words to tell at once to what class they be- 
long, from what sort of words they are immediately formed, 
and from what language they are derived. I know no lesson 
which when well given awakens more interest and mental ac- 
tivity even among young children than this. 
It is well known that the part of English grammar which is 
Composition, usually considered most practical as an aid in cor- 
rect speaking consists of the Rules of Syntax. But 
although it is useful to have at hand a compendium of such 
Tules and to refer to them occasionally, experience shows that 
they have no value as guides. The true discipline in correct 
speech is to be found in the practice of composition, which 
should begin from the first. Short sentences should be pre- 
pared by the pupil to exemplify each new fact or distinction 
which you explain, and by degrees the sentences may become more complex, 
In the choice of subjects for composition exercises, let them 
be those on which the scholars have something to say. Do not 
vask your scholars to write on mere abstract themes, “ Virtus est bona res,” “Time is money,” and other arid generalities of that Kind, have little interest for scholars, and they do not know what to say about them. Let the composition exercises always refer to something of which a boy has the material at hand, an expedition he has recently taken, a story you have just read to
-P-A-G-E-254

  him, a letter detailing some recent experience or well-known 
fact. It is probable that the number of solecisms in speech or 
in the formation of sentences which you will find among your 
pupils is very small, especially if they are in the habit of living 
and speaking with educated people at home. The chief diffl- 
culties which occur in actual composition are apt to show 
themselves in connection with the use of the relatives, and con. 
nective words particularly in those sentences which are ellipti- 
cal in form, and in which some part has to be supplied. You will deal with this form of fault partly by requiring asa rule that sentences should be shorter than young people are apt to make them; partly by requiring the /acwne in elliptical senten- 
ces to be filled up, and partly by taking an involved or mud- dled sentence now and then, and setting scholars to parse or analyze it. This indicates where the difficulty of the construc- 
tion lies, and helps to show how the thought might by a rear- Tangement of words, or by the use of two sentences instead of one, be more concisely or more elegantly expressed. 
One essential object contemplated in the study of our own language is a knowledge of the meanings of its Meanings words, This, it is true, is not grammar, but it is of words. closely connected with it. Definitions of words, however, must not be learned by heart, from dictionaries or lists, because the same word has not always the same meaning, and because the 
meaning is often determined by the context, Sentences, we 
have said, are to a child easier than single words, and it is of- 
ten better to require a paraphrase of a short sentence, than to 
demand exact synonyms, which though right in the particular 
case will be wrong for others, Not until after much practice 
in giving the substance of short sentences in other language, is it 
useful to require exact definitions of particular words. 
In fashioning lessons for Paraphrase, it will be well to adopt for yourselves and your pupils a few very simple yp. a onrase, tules: : 
(1) Do not think that you have to find an equivalent for 
every word. But read the whole passage, turn it over in the
-P-A-G-E-255
254 The English Language. 
mind; keep in view its drift and general purpose, and then re- 
write it, so as to convey the collective meaning of the passage, 
not a translation of its words. 
(2) Do not be afraid of using the same word, if it is clearly 
the best, and an equivalent cannot be found. 
(8) Be sure that the sentences are short and simple, and guard 
with special care against the vicious use of relatives, participles, 
and connective words, and particularly of any constructions 
which you could not easily parse. 
(4) Never use two words where one would suffice to express 
your thought; nor a hard word where an casy one would con- 
vey your meaning; nor any word at all unless you are quite 
sure it has a meaning to convey. At the same time, in dealing 
with very concise writers it is not necessary to try to make the 
paraphrase as short as the original. : 
(6) Do not translate all the metaphors, or all the poetry into 
prose. Slight change of figurative language is quite legitimate 
so long as the meaning is preserved, © 
(6) Keep in mind the general style of the extract, and, if it 
be grave or playful, maintain its character as far as you can, 
and be careful that the result shall bea perfectly readable piece 
of English, which would be intelligible to those who had no 
knowledge of the original. 
I will suppose that with these general rules in view you 
Examples. attempt to recast the following well-known pas- 
sage from Bacon: 
Studies serve for delight, for ornament, and for ability. The chief 
use for delight is in privateness and retiring; for ornament is in dis- course; and for ability is in the judgment and disposition of business. 
For expert men can execute, and perhaps judge of particulars one by 
one, but the general counsels, and the plots and marshalling of affairs 
come best from those that are learned. To spend too much time in 
studies is sloth; to use them too much for ornament is affectation; to 
make judgment wholly by their rules is the humor of a scholar. They 
perfect nature, and are perfected by experience. For natural abilities 
are like natural plants, that need pruning by study. And studies them- 
selves do give forth directions too much at large, except they be bound- 
‘ed in by experience.

Crafty men contemn Studies, simple men admire them, and wise men 
use them. For they teach not their own use; but that is a wisdom with- out them and above them, won by observation.—Bacon's Essays. 
You first read it aloud, and point out that here the word “studies” is used for learning generally, ‘You call attention to the special sense in which for his present purpose Bacon uses the words “ability,” discourse,” and “crafty.” You show how closely he has packed his meaning into a few words, And perhaps you arrive after this at something of this sort: 
I, Learning is valuable in three wayS—as a source of pleasure, as a means of adding grace and beauty to life, and as an instrument for the discharge of duty. The first of these advantages is chiefly enjoyed in solitude; the second is found in social intercourse, while its third use is that it helps us to order and arrange the business of life. For although men of natural acuteness can perform good work and form right judg- ments about its details, yet the power to view things comprehensively, 
to group them together, and to exercise a wise forethought in the ar- rangement of business is rarely possessed except by the well-instructed man. 
It is a mark of indolence to give ourselves up wholly to the enjoyment 
of literature; it is a proof of self-conceit to value our reading only as & means of display; while to determine all questions by what books say is the sure characteristic of a pedant. Learning supplements and im- Proves natural gifts, but itself needs to be further improved by the experience of life; for our natural gifts are like trees which need discipline and culture, and learning itself is apt to mislead a student, 
unless its conclusions are corrected by actual experience. 
Learning is not unfrequently despised by the clever practical man; it 
‘s regarded with childish wonder by the foolish; but it is only truly appreciated by the wise. For learning does not teach its possessor how, to employ it; the power to do this aright isa higher attainment than any scholarship, and can only come by thinking and observing. 
Or you choose for an analysis of its meaning part of the 
opening passage of Paradise Lost.

It is not well to begin at once and try to paraphrase line by 
line. But the character of the invocations with which the Iliad 
and the Aineid commence may be pointed out; then Milton’s 
classicalism, dominated as it was in this case by devout Chris- 
tian feeling; then the passage in Genesis which was evidently 
in his mind; finally the mingling of humility in the presence 
of so vast an undertaking, with an inward consciousness of 
power to achieve it. Afterwards the meaning of the whole 
Passage admits of being rendered on this wise; 
I. But most of all do I invoke Thine aid and teaching: Thou Holy 
Spirit, whose choicest dwelling place is the guileless and reverent hu- 
man heart. Thou wast present at the beginning and like a dove with

impregnate it with life.

In choosing passages for this purpose, it is well to have regard as much to the ease, the dignity, and the charm of the 
language as to the instruction which it may convey. And 
exercises of this kind, though more often in writing, may often. with advantage be oral, and should almost always be made the subject of conversation and questioning before they are attempted.

ber of particulars, of seeing the difference between the most 
relevant and the least relevant parts of a statement, and of stripping off all the dressing and circumlocution from the one chief purpose of a writer, is not only of special value in the after conduct of official business, but it is in itself of great value in promoting discernment and clearness of thought, 
Considering how important a part is played by verse-making in the learning of Greek and Latin, it is remarka- saonti ble that the composition of English verse is so ‘Versification. seldom set as 2 school exercise. It must be owned that the Sapphics and Hexameters produced by school-boys do little to call out invention and literary taste. They are good exercises in grammar and prosody, and they guard the pupil against the one deadly sin of making false quantities;—a sin however, of which in the case of two languages which are seldom or never to be spoken,—~it is very easy to exaggerate the seriousness. The effort is apt to prove a very mechanical one, and to be somewhat sterile in intellectual result; because the pupil is much more concerned with the length and shortness of the syllables, than with their meaning, Similar failure would result from exercises in English versification, if the making of 
Thymes, or the use of difficult metres were required. But when 
the pupil is familiar with some good passages from Shake- Speare, Milton, and Wordsworth, and has caught the ring and Movement of the English heroic measure, it is worth while to 
draw attention to the conditions which render that measure 
musical and effective, to the law of the recurrent accents, and to the necessity of making the structure of the thought, and the logical arrangement of the sentences fit in with the struc- 
tare of the verse. Then it is a good exercise to give a subject, 
or a suitable extract from a book, and to require it to be repro- 
duced in blank verse. This will be found to encourage the 
choice of a diction, elevated a little above that of ordinary life; 
to give practice in conciseness, and in the better arrangement of the thoughts; and to tune the ear toa truer perception not 
only of the melody of verse, but also of that of rhythmical prose.

And here it seems fitting to make some reference to English 
‘The Literature asa branch of school instruction. This 
of eneth is a comparatively new ingredient introduced of 
Literature late years into the school course, and largely en- 
couraged, and almost enforced by the influence of the Local 
and other University Examinations. A play of Shakespeare, 
ora part of Paradise Lost is taken as a theme, and read criti- 
cally. In order to do this well several things are necessary: 
(1) To explain and trace to their origin all difficult and archaic 
words, (2) To hunt out all the historical and other allusions, 
@) To elucidate the meaning and purpose of the book as a 
whole, (4) To analyze, paraphrase, and learn by heart, choice 
and characteristic passages, (5) To know something of the 
circumstances in which it was written, and the relation in 
which it stands, not only to the author’s other writings, but to 
the literature of the period, and (6) To examine its style, 
and discover its merits or peculiarities as a work of literary 
art,

which were supposed. to be useful in examinations, and that in 
this way all the enjoyment of the flavor and style of a book, as 
a great work of art, became impossible. 
Indeed the complaint is not unfrequently made, that the 
habit of treating Macbeth or Comus as a lesson, taking it to 
pieces and putting them together again like a puzzle, is rather 
Jowering and vulgarizing in its effect, and calculated to destroy 
the freshness and interest with which the reader enjoys the 
book for its own sake. Now, this result is no doubt possible, 
but if it arises, I am sure it comes from bad and unskilful 
teaching, 
It is surely a little inconsistent on the part of scholars, who 
profess to have formed their own literary taste by the close 
study of the Greck and Roman classics, and who do not admit 
that all the school exercises, the grammar, and the versification, 
have deadened their admiration for the beauties of Virgil and 
Homer, to say as they sometimes do that the study in an analo- 
gous way of an English poet tends to deprave the literary 
taste, and to give disagreeable associations with our own 
classics. It would be truer to say, An Englishman can get 
discipline in taste and expression from reading Homer criti- 
cally, although the language is ancient and unfamiliar, He 
ought also to get a like advantage from reading Shakespeare 
or Burke, though the language in which they wrote is his own, 
It is because English is our vernacular that a fuller knowledge 
of Shakespeare than of Homer is possible to an Englishman; 
and we should therefore set ourselves to attain it. . 
Listen here to a passage from one of Dr, Arnold’s letters. 
“ My delight in going over Homer and Virgil with the boys makes me 
thin what treatit mast be to teach Shakespeare to a good class of 
young Greeks in regenerate Athens, to dwell upon him line by line, and 
word by word, in the way that nothing but a translation Jesson ever will 
enable one to do, and so to getall bis pictures and thoughts leisurely 
into one’s mind, till I verily think one would after a time almost give 
out light in the dark, after having been steeped as it were in such on 
atmosphere of brilliance. And how could this ever be done without 
having the power of construing, 48, the proper medium through which
-P-A-G-E-261
          
          260 The English Language. 
  alone all the beauty can be transmitted?! because else we travel too fast 
and more than half of it escapes us.”” 
There is here, as you see, a recognition of the fact that the 
slow process of construing, translating, and analyzing line by 
line, is, in the case of an author whose works are in a foreign 
language, very helpful to true literary insight and enjoyment. 
No doubt classic authors may be taught in so dull and soulless 
a way that pupils attach very unpleasant associations to the 
great names of antiquity, and their interest in them is perma- 
nently deadened. But no one who has ever had the good 
fortune to read a play of Eschylus or a book of the Aineid 
with a thoroughly sympathetic teacher can doubt that Arnold

his images and pictures, may be thoroughly appreciated in the

clear gain to us, and I do not see why any of that literary sensi- 
bility which comes from the sympathetic reading of a good 
book merely for our own delight should be sacrificed to it. Of 
course we must not be challenging admiration, or leading the 
pupil to express a pleasure which he does not fecl. Still less 
must we fall into the ignoble habit of reading such a book with a view to examination only. It is however a great mistake to suppose that intelligence and perception are of less value in an 
examination than a few technical facts and dates, Nothing is more welcome toa good examiner than the discovery of any 
proof of originality or critical power, of strong opinion, or honest admiration, provided it goes with thorough knowledge of the substance of the book which is learned. The one thing which maddens an examiner is the mere routine of the text- 
books, the conventional critical judgments of the lecture-room 
mechanically reproduced, the use of second-hand estimates of 
books which the candidate has evidently never read. And so I would urge on you, when you have before you the two ob- Jects, first of enabling your pupil to understand and intelli- gently to admire an English classic; and then of enabling him also to get some credit for his knowledge at an examination: keep the larger and the nobler aim before you; disregard the second; and be sure nevertheless that this is the best way of attaining the second. There is not and ought not to be any 
teal inconsistency between the two purposes.

and ends. What is the end which we propose to ourselves in 
all lessons on literature? It is to produce a permanent appetite 
for reading, a power of discriminating what is good from what 
is bad, and a conscious preference for it. “‘ What a heaven,” 
says Bishop Hall, “lives a scholar in, that at once and in one close room can daily converse with all the glorious writers and 
fathers, and single them out at pleasure! To find wit in poetry, 
in philosophy profoundness, in mathematics acuteness, in his-

in this department, For if your scholars do not acquire a posi- tive love for reading, if they do not ask to be allowed to read the whole book or poem of which the extract you take as a lesson forms a part; if you do not find them voluntarily bunt-

Why Arithmetic Should be Tunght. 263 
a nnn 
X. ARITHMETIC AS AN ART. 
Brrore asking how we should teach Arithmetic it may be 
well to ask for a moment why we should teach it yoy arith- 
at all, There are two conceivable objects in metic should 
teaching any subject. (1) Because the thing be taught. 
taught is necessary, or useful, and may be turned to practical 
account, or (2) Because the incidental effect of teaching it is to 
bring into play and exercise certain powers and capabilities, 
and so to serve a rea] educational purpose. As we have seen, 
some things we teach are justifiable on the one, and some on 
the other of these grounds. And it behoves us all, whatever 
be the subject we teach, to make sure which of these two pur- 
poses we are aiming at. For if lessons on any subject are not 
valuable, either for their obvious practical uses or for their 
disciplinal effect on the general power and capacity of the 
pupil, there is no justification for teaching that subject at all. 
But of Arithmetic we may safely say at the outset, that if 
rightly taught, it is well calculated to fulfil both goth an 
purposes. Its rules become of real service in Artanda 
helping us to solve the problems of daily life; and . 
its laws and principles, if rightly investigated, serve to set par- 
ticular mental faculties in operation, and s0 to further the im- 
provement and development of the learner. Jt is conspicu- 
ously one of those subjects of school instruction the purpose of 
which extends beyond itself. Its ideas and processés can be 
effectively applied to other regions of knowledge. You can- 
not measure its intellectual usefulness by looking only at ite 
immediate aims. It is, in fact, poth an Art and a Science:— 
an Art because it contemplates the doing of actual work, the

attainment of definite and useful results; a Science because it 
investigates principles, because he who unearths the truths 
which underlie the rules of Arithmetic, is being exercised, not 
merely in the attainment of a particular kind of truth about 
numbers, but in the processes by which truth of many other 
kinds is to be investigated and attained. 
Now it is unnecessary to remind you that of these two as- 
Often re- pects or uses of Arithmetic, the former is that 
garded a an which we usually associate with the name. It is 
% not reasoning about numbers, but using figures 
for the purpose of calculation and working out sums, that we 
generally understand by the study of Arithmetic in schools. A 
text-book of Arithmetic is often a book of exercises and prob- 
lems, and nothing more. We all remember Goldsmith’s 
schoolmaster, of whom it was said that 
“Lands he could measure, terms and’tides presage, 
And even the story ran that he could gauge.” 
Such & pedagogue, who could do sums of surprising length and intricacy, and set them down in beautiful figures in a book duly garnished with flourishes, passed then for the good arithmetician. The scholar who could work out the largest number of problems by the shortest and most dexterous -methods was the winner of all the prizes, and so long as he produced right answers, the extent to which he had under- stood the processes he employed was a matter of small con- 
No doubt this notion of the Place Arithmetic should hold in school-work, and of the object to be attained in teaching it, is still very prevalent. But it was not always so. Arithmetic, as tang in oe schools of Athens or Alexandria; to the con. en poraries of Socrates and Alcibiades; or later, when in the iddle Ages it shared with logic, geometry, grammar and rhetoric and music the distinction of forming one of the staple subjects of a liberal education, was taught in its principtes, y a logical discipline; as Something to be understood rather than

asa series of devices for working out problems. It was how- 
ever often mixed up with some wholly unsound and indefen- 
sible theories about the mystic properties of certain numbers: 
and numerical relations were supposed to furnish the key to 
certain moral and spiritual questions, with which we now 
think they have nothing to do. 
It is interesting to turn to the oldest treatise in Arithmetic in our language and to see the spirit in which the subject was 
treated. 
In Robert Recorde’s Arithmetich, or the Grounde of Artes, dedicated to Edward VI., we have the first suc. Robert 
cessful attempt to popularize the study of the Recorde’s 
“Algorithmic science,” as it was then called, in 47i#hmetick. England. It is written in the form of a dialogue, for, as the author quaintly says in his Preface, “I judge that to be the easiest way of instruction, when the scholar may aske any 
doubts orderly, and the master may answer to his question 
plainly.” Accordingly, the book opens thus: 
Scholar. “Sir, such is your authority in mine estimation, that I am content to consent to your saying, and to receive it as truth, though I see none other reason that doth lead me thereunto: whereas else in 
miné owne conceite it appeareth but vaine to bestowe anie time pri- 
vately on that which every childe may and doth learne at all times and 
hours. 
Master. Lo, this is the fashion and chance of all them that seeke to 
defend their blind ignorance, that when they think they have made 
strong reason for themselves, then have they proved quite the con- 
trary,” 
He goes on to vindicate his favorite study, and to show its 
importance; and the docile pupil, whose function it is through- 
out the work to exhibit constant wonder and delight at the 
revelation of each new rule, soon expresses interest ” ine sap 
ject, and is conducted through the science 
temper which cannot be too much admired, if we may take 
the following fragment as an example: 
“ Scholar, Truly, Sir, these excellent conclusions do wonderfully 
make me more and more in love with the art.

uew method of finding the cubic contents of a cask, and so 
forth. The goal to be reached in the teaching of arithmetic is 
very clearly defined, and all the progress towards it is regulated 
accordingly. The successful arithmetician is to be a good computer, a skilful tradesman, a land surveyor, or an excise- 
Tan; and the whole object of the art is to fit him to perform 
one or other of these important functions, 
We are so accustomed to hear Arithmetic spoken of as one of the three fundamental ingredients in all The 2 of Schemes of instruction, that it seems like inquir- Areaetis ing too curiously to ask why this should be, course. 
Reading, Writing, and Arithmetic—these three are assumed to be of co-ordinate rank, Are they indeed co-ordinate, and if so on what ground? 
In this modern “trivium” the art of Reading is put first. Well, there is no doubt as to its right to the fore- Two pur- 
most place. For reading is the instrument of all poses to be our acquisitions. It is indispensable. There is *TV4 by it. not an hour in our lives in which it does not make a great dif- 
ference to us whether we can read or not. And the art of Writ- 
ing, too; that is the instrument of all communication, and it 
becomes, in one form or other, useful to us every day. But 
Counting—doing sums,—how often in life does this accom- 
plishment come into exercise? Beyond the simplest additions 
and the power to check the items of a bill, the arithmetical 
knowledge required of any well-informed person in private life is very limited. For all practical purposes, whatever I may 
have learned at school of fractions, or proportion, or decimals, 
is, wnless I happen to be in business, far less frequently avail- 
able to me in life than a knowledge, say, of the history of my 
own country, or of the elementary truths of physics. The truth is, that regarded as practical arts, reading, writing, and 
arithmetic have no right to be classed together as co-ordinate 
elements of education; for the last of these is considerably less 
useful to the average man or woman not only than the other 
two, but than many others which might be named. But read-

ing, writing, and such mathematical or logical exercise 3s may 
be gained in connection with the manipulation of numbers, have 
a right to constitute the primary elements of instruction, And 
I believe that arithmetic, if it deserves the high place that it 
conventionally holds in our educational system, deserves it 
mainly on the ground that it is to be treated as a logical exer- 
cise. It is the only branch of mathematics which has found 
its way into primary and early education; other departments of 
pure science being reserved for what is called higher or uni- 
versity instruction. But all the arguments in favor of teaching 
algebra and trigonometry to advance students, apply equally 
to the teaching of the principles or theory of arithmetic to 
school-boys. It is calculated to do for them exactly the same 
kind of service, to educate one side of their minds, to bring into 
play one set of faculties which cannot be so severely or properly 
exercised in any other department of learning. In short, rela- 
tively to the needs of a beginner, Arithmetic, as a science, is 
just as valuable—it is certainly quite as intelligible—as the 
higher mathematics to a university student, 
It is probably because the purcly utilitarian or practical view

. Girls at school are, if not actually encouraged to 
dislike arithmetic, apt to take for granted that it is rather an un- 
feminine pursuit, that it is certainly unnecessary, and probably 
vulgar. And, no doubt, if the conventional notion about the pur- 
Pose of Arithmetic is well founded, they are right. If ciphering means a collection of artifices for doing sums; if the great object 
of learning the art is to be fitted for the counting-house or the shop. # {hen the ‘instinet which makes governesses and their pupils rom. metic isa true one. But if Arithmetic is a study capable of yielding intellectual fruit, if it helps to quicken and concentrate the attention, to bring under control tha

known to the unknown, to cnable us to perceive the nature of 
a fallacy, and to discriminate the two sides of a fine line by 
which the true is often separated from the false; if, in short, 
the study of Arithmetic is mainly helpful in showing what truth 
is, and by what methods it is attained, then surely it bears just 
as close a relation to the necds of a woman’s life as to those of 
aman. For she, too, has intellectual problems to solve, books 
to read, and opinions to form; and she will do all this to good 
purpose in just the proportion which she brings to her work a 
trained and disciplined understanding, accustomed to analyze 
the grounds of belief, and to proceed by slow and careful steps 
from premises to inference. 
So much will suffice for the present as to the greater purposes 
to be served in the teaching of Arithmetic. But The practi- 
the lesser purpose is not insignificant, and must cal side of ° 
not be overlooked, It is no slight thing to be a tic. 
good computer, and to know how to apply arithmetical rules 
deftly and accurately to the management of an income, to the 
conduct of business, to statistics, to averages, to scientific and 
political data, and to the manifold problems which life pre- 
sents. And even though the higher aims of Arithmetic are al- 
together overlooked, it cannot be said that time is wasted in 
achieving the lower aim. So much of arithmetical knowledge 
as is fairly tested by setting sums to be worked, and as is re- 
quired in order to work them promptly and accurately, is well 
worth attaining. Its relative importance to genuine mathe- 
matical training may be, and often has been, exaggerated, but 
of its absolute importance there can be little question. 
Thus then the two distinct uses of Arithmetic, (1) Its direct 
or practical use as an instrument for the solution of problems, 
and (2) Its indirect or scientific use as a means of calling out the 
reasoning faculty, require to be separately apprehended, and I 
am intending to ask you to-day to look at the first, and in my 
next lecture at the second, and to inquire how cach of the two 
objects thus to be kept in view can be best fulfilled. Of of die 
two objects may be logienlly separable, and for purposes 0}

cussion here may be treated apart, while as a matter of fact they 
are pursued together. In attaining either object you cannot help 
doing something towards the attainment of the other, For you 
cannot teach practical arithmetic, even by mere rule of thumb, 
without giving some useful intellectual discipline; and you can- 
not make the theory and laws of Arithmetic clear to a boy’s 
understanding without also giving him some serviceable rules 
for practical use. Still we may with advantage treat the two 
purposes of Arithmetic separately, and at present ask ourselves 
only how to teach Arithmetic as an Art, 
A really good computer is characterized by three qualities— 
promptitude, perfect accuracy, and that skill or 
flexibility of mind which enables him at once to 
seize upon the real meaning of a question, and to apply the 
best method to its solution. How are these qualities best to be 
attained? 
Now the first thing necessary to be borne in mind is the fa- 
Early 7 exer miliar truth; that a child’s earliest notions of num- 
crete not ber are concrete, not abstract. He knows what 
abstract. three roses or three chairs mean before he can 
make abstraction of the number 8 as 2 separate entity. Hence 
it will be seen that the earliest exercises in counting should take 
the form of counting actual objects. For this purpose the ball- frame or abacus is generally employed, and with great advan- tage. He should count also the objects in the room, the panes of glass in the window, a handful of pebbles, the pictures on the wall, and the number of scholars in the class. It must not be set down as a fault if at first he counts with his fingers. Let 
- him do so by all means if he likes, The faculty of abstracting numberg, and of learning to do without visible and tangible illustrations comes more slowly to some children than others. 
So long as they get the answer right, let them have what help 
they want till this power comes. It is sure to come ere long. 
At first, too, the little questions and problems which are given 
to children may fitly refer to marbles or apples, or to things 
which are familiar to them. But the mistake made by many Computation.
-P-A-G-E-272
The Discipline of an Arithmetic Class, 271 
  
teachers is to continue using these artifices too long; to go on 
showing an abacus, or talking about nuts and oranges after the 
children have fully grasped the meaning of 6+ 5 in the ab- 
stract, and are well able to do without visible help. It is a sure 
test of a good teacher that he knows when and how far to em- 
ploy such artifices, and when to dispense with them. The 
moment that concrete illustrations have served their purpose, 
they should be discarded. 
* Remember also that Arithmetic is one of the lessons in which 
discipline is more important than in any other. g¢rict 
The amount of order and drill which may suffice discipline 
for a good lesson in reading or geography will 
not suffice for arithmetic. Undetected prompting and copying 
are easier in this subject than in any other, and they are more 
fatal to. real progress. It is important that in computing a 
scholar should learn to rely on the accuracy of his own work. 
If he has any access to the answer, and works consciously to- 
wards it; if he can get a whispered word or a surreptitious 
figure to guide him, the work is not his own, and he is learning 
little or nothing. It is therefore essential that your discipline: 
should be such, that copying or friendly suggestion during the 
working ofa sum shall be impossible. It is idle, in this con- 
nection, to talk of honor. The sense that it is dishonorable to 
avail one’s self of any such chance help as comes in one’s way 
in solving a problem is, after all, only a late product of moral 
training. You do not presuppose its existence in grown men 
at the universities, who are undergoing examinations for de- 
grees, or even for Holy Orders. You have no right to assume 
its presence in the minds of little children. They will at first 
copy from one another without the smallest consciousness that 
there is any harm in it. After all there is nothing immoral in

us, of course, and it happens to be inconsistent with genuine 
progress in Arithmetic, and it is for these reasons that it be- 
comes necessary to stop it. The truth is that if you want to 
train children in the habit of doing their own work well, and
-P-A-G-E-273
272 Arithmetic as an Art. 
  
depending on its accuracy, you must do habitually that which 
is done at all public examinations—make copying impossible. 
And this may be done by divers expedients, e.g. by giving dif- 
ferent exercises to scholars as they sit alternately, so that no 
two who are together shall have the same sum, or by placing 
them in proper attitudes, and at needful distances,-and under 
vigilant supervision. 
Again I suggest that a good many sums should be given.out 
in words, not in figures. Remember that the 
grencut actual questions of life are not presented to us in 
not figures. the shape of sums, but in another form which we 
have to translate into sums, and that this business of translat- 
ing the question out of the ordinary form into the form adopted. 
in the arithmetic books is often harder than the working of the 
sum itself; e.g., take 3018 from 10,000. In an ill-taught school 
a child is puzzled by this; he first asks what rule itisin. He 
next asks how to set it down. Both of these are questions 
which he ought to answer for himself. 
So long as a pupil finds any difficulty whatever in recognizing 
an exercise in a given rule, under any guise, however un- 
familiar, be sure he does not understand that Tule, and ought not to quit it for a higher. 
It is a very useful aid to this sort of versatility or readiness, 
not only to practise yourselves as teachers in the manufacture of new exercises, but also to encourage your pupils to invent 
new questions on each rule before you pass from it to the next. 
‘You-will find a pupil's grasp of the real meaning and relations of an arithmetical rule much strengthened by the habit of fram- ing new questions. Moreover you will find it a very popular 
and interesting exercise, which Will kindle a good deal of spirit and animation in your class.

guard against the tendency of children before they get to the 
end of the sum to glance furtively at the answer, and to work 
towards it, Perhaps if the right answer is evidently not com- 
ing the pupil alters a figure, or introduces a new multiplier in 
order to bring it right. But a sum so wrought is a very un- 
satisfactory and delusive performance. 
It is well at first rather to give a good number of short ex- 
ercises irregularly formed, than to use those large jumerous 
symmetrical masses of figures, which the school- short exer. 
books are apt to give us, and which are so much able to a few

take a good deal of time, and leave him a little more breathing 
space. A large square addition sum, in which all the lines are 
of the same length, and all extend to hundreds of millions, is 
far less likely to be useful than ‘‘ Add seventeen to a hundred 
and twenty, that to three thousand and ninety-six, that to 
twenty-seven, and that to five.” Many children in fact who 
can do the first will be unable to do the second. Now and 
then, however, it isa good thing to give a very long exercise, 
to test sustained attention and continuity of thought, and to in- 
sure accuracy. 
It is good also to take care that before proceeding to any new 
Tule, you give a few exercises, which call out not. Recapitula-

rules. There is no true progress if any one of the elementary 
rules is allowed to drop out of sight. 
I am often struck with the want of skill shown in making 
sure at each step that all previous steps are understood. This 
arises no doubt from the way in which exercises are arranged 
in books, grouped under the heads of the various rules. A 
child gets a rule, works a number of sums all alike, and then 
leaves to go on to another. Whereas exercises ought to be.so 
graduated and sums so carefully framed as to bring into play 
all that has previously been learned, and to fix and fasten the 
memory of former rules. There is hardly any one text-book 
which I know that does this sufficiently. You should be sup-

exercise in neatness and arrangement, and in the

because it pleases parents, and is the only visible evidence of

asa device for increasing or strengthening a child’s arithmetical 
knowledge it is very useless. I venture. to warn you, there- 
fore, against the inordinate use of what are called “ ciphering 
books;” believing, as I do, that in just the proportion in which 
you teach Arithmetic intelligently, you will learn to rely less on 
such mechanical devices. 
It will be well for us to consider, too, what use it is 
Oral or which a pupil makes of a slate or a paper when mental he is working a sum. The object of all rules Arithmetic. is, of course, to show how a long or complex 
Problem, which cannot be worked by a single effort of the mind, may be resolved into a number of separate problems each 
simple enough to be so wrought. As each separate result in multiplication, division, or addition is thus attained, we set it down as a help to the memory, and are thus at liberty to go on to the next. Now it is evident that the worth and accuracy 
of the general result depend upon the correctness with which We work out each of these single items. It is a good plan, therefore, to give a pupil some oral practice in the manipula- 
tion of single numbers, before setting him down to work 2 sum. 
This-Oral or Mental Arithmetic has long been a favorite ex- 
ercise in elementary schools, but it has not been very gencrally 
adopted in schools of a higher class, One reason for this is to 
be found in the very restricted and technical use made of the
-P-A-G-E-276
Oral or Mental Arithmetic. 275 
    
exercise. In manuals of Mental Arithmetic, advantage is 
taken of little accidental facilities or resemblances afforded by 
particular numbers, and rules are founded upon them: e.g., 
(1) To find the price of a dozen articles; call the pence shillings, and 
call every odd farthing three pence. . 
2) To find the price of an ounce, when the price of 1 1b. is known; call 
the shillings farthings and multiply by three. : (8) To find the price of a score, call the shillings pounds. 
(4) To find the interest on a sum of money at 5 per cent., for a year; 
call the pounds shillings, and for every additional month call the pound 
& penny. 
(6) To square a number; add the lower unit to the upper, multiply by 
the tens, and add the square of the unit. 
Each of these rules happens to offer special facilities in com- 
putation. But the occasions on which a question Tts abuses 
actually occurs in one of these forms are rare; and. . 
the student who has his memory filled with these rules is not 
helped, but rather hindered by them when, for example, he 
wants to know what fourteen articles will cost, or what is the 
interest at 8 per cent., or how to multiply 75 by 23. All such 
rules are apt to seem more useful than they are, and when chil- 
dren, who have learned the knack of solving a few such problems 
are publicly questioned by those who are in the secret, the re- 
sult is often deceptive. I attended an exhibition or oral ex- 
amination of a middle school of some pretensions a short time 
ago; and the teacher of Arithmetic undertook to put the 
scholars through a little testing drill. All his questions fell 
within the narrow limits of some of these special rules. He 
also gave one or two exercises in rapid addition which were

the next two also; and that all the questions were framed on 
the same pattern. Many of the audience did not detect this, 
but of course the children were in the secret, and were, in fact, 
confederates with the teacher in an imposture. It is because so 
much of what is called mental arithmetic consists of mere tricks 
of this kind that the subject has been somewhat justly dis- 
credited by good teachers. 
But the mental Arithmetic which is of real service does not 
Tis uses. consist in exercise in a few special rules, but in 
rapid, varied, and irregular problems in ali the 
forms which computation may take. It differs mainly from 
written Arithmetic, in that it uses small numbers instead of 
large ones. Before atteropting to work exercises in writing in 
any rule, a good oral exercise should be given to familiarize 
the pupils with the nature of the operation. I will give a few 
examples to illustrate my meaning: 
@) Addition and Subtraction. Take the number 3, add to it 1 and 
Examples successively to the sums, up to 50. 
ofor 7 1, 4, 7, 10, 18, 16, 19, 22, 25, 28, 81, etc. etc, 
So with sevens: 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, 48, 50, 5%, 64, 71. Then take 50 or 100 and go rapidly backwards taking away 8 every time, or seven, or eleven, 
You will observe as you do this that there are certain combinations 
less easy than others. He whose turn it is to say 21 after 18, or to take 
away 8 from 82, will halt a moment Jonger than the rest. You observe 
this, and make up a series of questions in which these two particular numbers shall be brought into relation: 28 and 3,48 and 3,19 and 3, 3 . trom 42,8 from 21, ete. 
There are but nine digits, and if in succession you give nine short brisk lessons,—one on each,—requiring the number to be added and subtracted rapidly, you will come in Succession upon every possible combination of these digits. You will bear in mind that when you your- 
self make an error in adding upa line of figures, you can trace it to some particular pair of units, say the 8 and the 7, or the 9 and the 5, which habitually give you more trouble than the rest. It is only prac- tice which can set you right. So the moment you observe any hitch or difficulty in special combinations or subtractions, it is well to work at them till they become thoroughly familiar, till for example the sight of Sand 7 together instantly suggests 5 as the unit of the sum, or the tak- ing away of 6 from a number ending in 3 instantly suggests 2 exercises,

Examples of Oral Exercise. 277 
{2) Money. Little exercises on the arithmetic, first of a shilling, after- 
wards of half a crown, and afterwards of a sovereign, are very interest- ing, and require no slate or book. The scholars should be practised in 
rapid adding and subtracting, in dividing it into parts, in reduction to 
half-pence and farthings; in telling different ways in which the whole 
may be made up, e.g., a shilling into Yd. and 5d., into 8d. and 4d., into iad. and 814d., into 414d. and 734d., ete., until every form of arithmeti- 
cal exercise possible with this sum of money shall be anticipated. 
(8) Simple Calculations in time; e.g., the time it will be 3 hours hence, 
8 hours, 12, 24; the date and day of the week, three days, four weeks, 
Seventeen hours, two months hence; and in like manner easy calcula- tions respecting lengths and weights, may fitly precede all attempts to work sums in compound arithmetic by written exercise. 
@ Fractions, The first oral exercises should be founded on familiar 
Sums of money, and on the products already known in the multiplication- 
table and may be graduated in some such way as this: 
(a) The third of a shilling, the 8th, the 12th, the 4th, the 6th, ete. The fifth of 20, the ninth of 27, the third of 18, the twelfth of 72, ete. (0) 3 of 6d., § of 54, of 21, 5A of 40, § of 16. (©) What number is that of which 5 is §; Of which 4 is #; Of which 10 is §; Of which 2s. is $; Of which 1s. 6d. is 3? (@) Find other fractions equal to 4, to 4, to }, to §, ete. © % of a foot, goof 1 1b., zg ofa week, 3% of an hour, 
By selecting your examples from fractions which present no com- plications or remainders, and by rapidly varying and often repeating them, it is easy to advance a considerable distance in the manipulation 
of fractions, before talking at all about numerators and denominators, or 
giving out what is called a rule. 
© Exercises on special numbers. (a) Take the number 60, Its half. 
lts third. Its fourth. Its fifteenth. Its sixteenth, etc. 
@®) Find two numbers which make 60; 24 and 36, 18 and 42, ete. 
“three numbers.........- seers U1, 14 and 85; 21, 19 and 20; 7, 
35 and 18, etc. 
(c) Take from 60 in rapid succession, fours, sevens, elevens, eights, 
threes, etc. .

{f) Find in how many ways 60 hurdles might be arranged s0 as to en- 
close a space, or in how many forms a payment of £60 might be made. 
(8) Proportion. (a) Name other figures representing the same ratio as 
5:%, As3:8, As 15: 21, ete. etc.

etc. 
A good teacher will invent hundreds of such exercises fot 
himself, and will not need a text-book. There is nothing un- 
sound or meretricious in mental arithmetic of this kind. On 
the contrary, it will prove to be one of the most effective in- 
struments in making your scholars good computers. It will 
give readiness, versatility, and accuracy, and will be found an 
excellent preliminary training for the working of ordinary 
sums in writing. Keep in view the general principle that the 
nature of each process should be made familiar by oral exercise 
- before recourse is had to pen or pencil at all, and that the oral 
exercises should be of exactly the same kind as written sums, 
but should differ only in their shortness, and in the fact that 
each problem requires only one or at most two efforts of 
thought, and deals only with figures such as can be held in the 
mind all at once, without help from the eye. Much activity of 
mind is needed on the part of a teacher who conducts this ex- 
ercise; and it is not its least recommendation that when so con- 
ducted it challenges the whole thinking faculty of the children, 
concentrates their attention, and furnishes capital discipline in 
promptitude and flexibility of thought,

in writing. The dimensions of the school-room and of the 
principal furniture should be known, and a foot or a yard, or 
a graduated line of five or ten feet should be marked con- 
spicuously on the wall, as a standard of reference, to be used 
when lengths are being talked about. The area of the play- 
ground; the length and width of the street or road in which the 
school stands; its distance from the church or some other 
familiar object, the height of the church spire, should all be 
distinctly ascertained by the teacher, and frequently referred 
to in lessons wherein distances have to be estimated. Children 
should be taught to observe that the halfpenny has a diameter 
of exactly one inch, and should be made to measure with it the 
width of a desk or the dimensions of a copy-book. It con- 
stantly happens, that if I ask elder children, who have “‘ gone 
through ” as it is called a long course of computation in “long 
measure,” to hold up their two hands a yard apart, or to draw a line three inches long on their slates, or to tell me how far I 
have walked from the railway station, or to take a’ book in 
their hands and tell me how much it weighs, their wild and 
speculative answers show me that elementary notions of the 
units of length and weight have not been, as they ought to be, 
conveyed before mere “ ciphering” was begun. 
As to weights and measures, they are, as we all know, a great 
stumbling-block. The books give usaformidable weights and

them by heart. But a little discrimination is wanted here. It 
-is needful to learn by heart the tables of those weights and 
measures which are in constant use, e.g. avoirdupois weight, 
long measure, and the number of square yards in an acre; but 
it is not worth while to learn apothecaries’ weight, cloth meas- 
ure, or ale and beer measure, because in fact these measures 
are not in actual or legal use; and because the sums which the 
books contain are only survivals from an earlier age when the 
technical terms in these tables, puncheons, hildorkins, scruples, 
and Flemish ells, had a real meaning, and were in frequent use. 
Keep these tables in the books by all means, and work some

  sums by reference to them: they are of course all good exer- 
cises in computation; but here, as elsewhere, abstain from 
giving to the verbal memory that which has no real value, and 
is not likely to come into use. 
It seems hardly necessary to refer to the efforts some teachers 
Moral lessons have made to use Arithmetic as a vehicle for the 
in sums. inculcation of Scriptural or other truths. Such 
efforts have been commoner in other countrics than our own. 
“How admirably,” says an enthusiastic French writer on 
Arithmetic, ‘‘ does this science lend itself to moral and re- 
ligious training.” 
Pére Girard composed a manual of Arithmetic in which, for 
the most part, the problems given had a distinctly hortatory 
character, and were meant to embody economic and moral in- 
struction. Here is an example. 
“Un pére de familie avait Phabitude d’aller tous les soirs au cabaret 
et laissait souvent sa famille sans pain a la maison. Pendant quatre 
ans quwil a mené cette vie il a depensé la premiére année 197 fr., 1a seconde 204 fr., la troisidme 212 fr., et la quatriéme 129 fr. Combien de francs aursit epargné ce malheureux pére s'il n’eut pas eu le gout de la boisson?” 
And another French writer secks on this wise to give a moral tone to his arithmetical lessons, He supposes the Curé to visit the school, and the teacher to say, 
‘What does the number 7 remind you of ? The 7 deadly sing, the 7 sacraments, and the 7 golden candlesticks. What have you to tell me about the number 129 ‘The num} then aa of es capes the number of the minor prophets, and of 
: And then he turns to the children, “ Mes enfants,” he says, “‘we have thus shown to our worthy pastor that we establish true relations between the art of computing and the principles of virtue and religion. Who will say after this that Arithmetic is not a moral and edifying study?”—Who indeed? Of course sums founded on Bible facts, on the age of Mcthusaleh, or the Jength of Goliath’s spear, are innocent enough. But I suspect |
-P-A-G-E-282
Rapid Computation. 281 
that all attempts of this kind to kill two birds with one stone, 
so to speak, are very unsatisfactory. Moreover it does not 
seem quite reverent to use books or names with which some of 
us have very sacred associations for the sake of mavufacturing 
arithmetical puzzles for school-boys. After all, in just the 
proportion in which children pay attention to the sum and do 
it well as a question in arithmetic they will disregard the moral 
or religious lessons which have been thus artificially forced 
into the exercise of counting. Arithmetic has indeed its own 
moral teaching. Rightly learned, it becomes a discipline in 
obedience, in fixed attention, in truthfulness and in honor. 
These are its appropriate lessons, and they are well worth 
learning. But if you want to deal with drunkenness and extra- - 
vagance, or to teach Bible History, it is better to adopt some 
other machinery than that of an arithmetic lesson. 
And touching one of these habits, that of fixed and concen- 
trated intellectual attention, it may be well to bear Rapid com- 
in mind how greatly it is helped by exercises in Putation. 
rapid counting. Now and then it is a useful exercise to have a 
match, and to let the scholars work a given number of sums 
against time,—say so many within half an hour. One great 
advantage of this is that it keeps the scholar’s whole power and 
faculty alive, and keenly bent on the one object. No irrelevant 
or foreign thought can for the time intrude into the mind. 
And quick work is not in arithmetic, as in so many other sub- 
jects, another"name for hasty and superficial work. In this 
one department of school life slowness and deliberation are 
rather ensnaring than otherwise. Intervals are here of little or 
no value for reflection. They merely give ap opportunity for 
the thoughts to wander. The quickest calculators are those 
who for the time during which they are engaged on a sum shut 
everything else but the sum out of their thoughts; and they are 
for that very reason the best calculators. 
Tt must not be forgotten that arithmetic, like all the other 
exact sciences, has the advantage of dealing with results which 
are absolutely certain, as far as we can claim certainty for any-

  thing we know. In mathematical and purely logical deduction 
we always know when we get at a result that it 
is either correct or incorrect. There are no de- 
grees of accuracy. One answer is right, and every other possi- 
ble answer is wrong. Hence if we want to get out of arithme- 
tic the training in precision and conscientious exactness which 
it is calculated to give, we must never be content with an an- 
swer which is approximately right; right for all practical pur- 
+poses, or right in the quotient, but a little wrong in the remain- 
der. The perfect correctness of the answer is essential, and I 
counsel you to attach as great importance to the minute ac- 
curacy of the remainder and what scems the insignificant part 
* of the answer, as to the larger and more important parts of it. 
In mathematics no detail is insignificant. 
‘You will occasionally get answers not only wrong, ‘but pre- 
Exercises in Pposterously and absurdly wrong; e.g. you ask 
forecasting | what per cent. of profit is gained, and receive 
answers, some thousands of pounds for the answer; or you 
ask a question the answer of which has to be time, and the 
pupil brings it you in pence. It is well to check this by often 
asking a scholar to tell approximately, and before he does his 
sum, what he expects the answer to be,—about how much; 
why e.g. it cannot be so great as a million, or so small as twen- 
ty, or in what denomination the answer is sure to come, And 
if he has not expected: anything, nor exercised himself in any

In teaching the art of computation it is legitimate to devise

"Such exercises may often be found in connectioi ‘y e fo connection 
with different methods of proving or verifying the answers to 
sums. When the answer has been found, the data and the 
quesita should be made to exchange places, and the scholars 
may be asked to construct new questions, so that each of the

factors in the original problem shall be made in turn to come 
out as the answer. Another method is to work out before the 
class in full a solution to a long and complex sum, and then 
invite the scholars to tell how the process might have been 
abridged; which of the figures set down was not essential as a 
means of obtaining the answer, or might have been dispensed 
with. Indeed the invention of contracted methods of working, 
whether by cancelling or otherwise, ought always to be at the 
suggestion of the scholar, and grow fairly out of his own expe- 
rience in working by a needlessly long process, It should sel- 
dom or never be enunciated as a rule by the teacher, 
It is perhaps hardiy necessary to remind any one here that 
it isa mistake to measure the practical utility of Commercial 
the arithmetical exercises you adopt by their visible 
relation to commerce, and to the affairs of life. Of course it is 
important that many of the problems you set should be as like 
the actual problems of business as possible. Mere conundrums, 
obviously invented by the bookmakers, are apt to seem very 
unreal to boys and girls; and they prefer to confront the sort 
of difficulties which they are likely to meet with out of school. 
So I think it desirable that you should make sums out of the 
bills you pay, and bearing on what you know to be the rents of 
the houses, the income and expenditure of familics of the class 
of life to which your pupils belong. You should keep your 
eyes open, and invent or take from the newspapers of the day 
little problems on the changing prices of goods, the weekly re- 
turns of births and deaths, the returns of the railway com- 
panies, or the fluctuations in the weekly wages of artisans. 
Simple examples of receipts, and of the use of a ledger and 
a balance-sheet, should also be given in connection with the 
smaller transactions, with which the scholars are most fa- 
miliar, 
But do not suppose that exercises which have no ostensible 
relation to real business are of inferior value even for Practical

counting-house and bank, and are in their immediate applica 
tion to business often far less serviceable than they seem. An 
eminent London Banker once said to me, ‘‘ The chief qualifica 
tions I want in a clerk are, next to good character and associa- 
tions, that he should write a good hand, that he should have 
been taught intelligently, especially in Arithmetic, and that he 
should ot have learned book-keeping. We have our own 
method of keeping accounts, and a pretentious systema of school_ 
book keeping has a number of technical terms which we do 
not use, and which hinder a lad from learning that method. 
But let him only have a good general knowledge of the princi- 
ples of arithmetic and counting, and we will undertake to teach 
him all that is peculiar to the books of our house in Jess than a 
week.” Perhaps this is an extreme case, but I am convinced that 
attempts to anticipate the actual application of arithmetic to 
the particular business in which a pupil may be hereafter en- 
gaged are generally mistakes. 
The application of arithmetic to the solution of problems is 
Other forms Often limited in the books to what is called busi- 
Or Bracticat ness. But commerce is after all only one, though 
the most prominent, of the uses to which arith- 
metic has to be put in life. There are many interesting and 
varied applications to other purposes, which might be used 
with advantage: e.g., 
The computation of the time of falling bodies,

The readings of the thermometer and the conversion of

The statistics of attendance in the school itself, and the

One great help to the easy solution of money questions is 
the habit of using decimal equivalents, or redue- Reduction ing sums of money at sight to decimals of £1. of Boal We are at present far from the adoption of a decimals. decimal coinage in England; but we can by anticipation 
enjoy, in our accounts at least, many of the advantages of 
a decimal system of money, by the adoption of a simple rule. 
Let it be observed that two shillings = £71, that one shilling = £'05, that sixpence =: £-025, and that a farthing differs only 
from £001 by a very small fraction; and it then becomes very: easy to frame a rule for conversion of ordinary expressions for 
money into their equivalent decimal expressions, 
Thus £17 16s. 74d. = £17'882, because 16s. = 8 florins or 
£8; 6d. = £°025, and 7 farthings = £:007. 
In like manner £21:367 = £21 4-8 florins or £°8 + 1 shilling 
- or £05 4- 17 farthings or £017, or in all £21 %. 44d. 
Half an hour's practice in conversion and reconversion in 
this way renders the process famiNar. All questions in which 
the given sum of money does not extend to lower fractions 
than 6d. can evidently be solved with perfect accuracy by 
decimals, and without encumbering the mind with the ordinary 
reduction at all. Nearly all questions in Interest and many in 
Practice and Proportion can be wrought much more expe- 
ditiously by this than by any other method. Precaution is 
needed in those questions only in which odd pence and farthings: 
occur and require to be multiplied. . |

quickness and versatility is just as well promoted, we must 
Temember, by working problems which have an abstract look 
as by solving those in which the phraseology of the counter or

One other department of mathematics which has found its way 
Practical into schools resembles Arithmetic in being an Art 
and having useful practical applications, and also in 
furnishing disciplinal and purely intellectual exercise.. Demon- 
strative Geometry has a value for this latter purpose, which, from 
the days of Plato and Archimedes, has been very generally rec- 
ognized; but the claims of merely practical geometry as a useful 
Part both of primary and of secondary instruction appear to me 
to deserve more consideration than they gencrally receive. Every 
scholar should be taught to use the compass and ruler, and the 
quadrant and scale of equal parts. He should draw simple geometrical figures, as well as talk xbout them, and recognize their properties. He should know how to measure angles and 
lines, and to construct ordinary plane figures. In the best 
schools of Germany, France, and Switzerland these simple things are taught to every scholar as matter of course. You 
may hear a teacher dictate to the class directions one by one as 
to the construction of a figure. “ Draw'a line 15 centimétres long, then another line upon it at ‘an angle of 35 degrees, then. 
another line of a given length to the right or left, ete., ete.,” 
until the class produces one after another figures which he has 
pre-determined, arid of which the qualities and dimensions are 
afterwards explained and discussed in the class. ‘The rules for 
practical geometry are comparatively few and simple; the ex-

ercise is interesting, and is a considerable relief from graver em- 
ployment, It serves to familiarize the scholar with the proper- 
ties of circles, of triangles, or of parallelograms, and so to make 
the future scientific study of geometry more intelligible. And 
for those who may never learn Euclid or even the modern system 
of demonstrative geometry which seems destined to supersede it, 
geomefrical drawing will be found to have a value of its own in 
enabling scholars to judge better of heights and distances, and 
to know at least the chief properties of plane and solid figures. 
Note on the form of Abacus. An ingenious modification of the Abacus, or ball-frame, in use in some of the French schools, possesses some ad- vantages over the square Chinese frame with horizontal bars which is in common use in English schools. It is thus constructed:

Havine sought to lay down some rules by which a teacher 
may be guided in making the mere arts of computation and 
- measurement effective parts of education, it becomes necessary 
to consider more fully the claims of Arithmetic as a science, 
and the reasons for assigning to it, as a disciplinal study, even 
@ higher rank than would be due to its practical usefulness. 
‘We should all be agreed that the main purpose of our intel- 
Science. lectual life is the acquirement of truth, and that 
. one of the things we go to school to learn is how | 
to acquire it, The mere accumulation of facts and information 4 
does not supply what we want. The difference between a wise 
man and one who is not wise consists less in the things he knows 
than in the way in which he knows them. We call arithmetic 
a science, and science, it may be said, means knowledge. But 
there is a good deal of knowledge which is uot science. Science, 
properly so called, is organized knowledge, knowledge of 
things and facts and events in their true relation and co-ordina- 
tion, their antecedents and consequences,—the recognition of 
every separate phenomenon in the shifting panorama of life as 
an illustration of some principle or law, broader, higher’ and 
more enduring than itself. No number of facts or aphorisms | 
learned by heart makes a man a thinker, or does him much 
intellectual service. Every particular fact worth knowing is 
connected with some general truth, and it is in the tracing of — 
the connection and collocation of particular and separate truths 
with general and abiding truths that science mainly consists.

purpose unless if is seen in its bearing on some political, eco- 
nomic, or moral jaw. And we have already seen that a gram- 
matical rule has scant meaning or use for us until it is seen as 
part of the science of language. This distinction runs through 
all sound and fruitful acquirement, and should always be 
present in the mind of a teacher. We must learn to see special 
facts and bits of experience in the light of the larger generaliza- 
tions by which the world is governed and held together. We 
have so to teach as to develop the searching and inquiring 
spirit, the love of truth, and the habit of accurate reasoning. 
And if Arithmetic can be so taught as to serve this purpose, it 
has a value which greatly transcends what. scem to be its 
immediate objects, and will be found to affect not the notions 
about number only, but also those about every other subject 
with which the understanding has to deal. 
Here it seems right to take the opportunity of referring to a 
distinction much insisted on in books on educa- Inductionand 
tion, and on which I have yet said little or nothing: Deduction. 
I mean the distinction between inductive and deductive modes 
of reasoning. In studying some subjects, the learner begins 
by acquiring separate facts, and as he goes on learns to group 
them, to see their resemblances, and to arrive at last at some 
larger statement of fact which embraces and comprehends them 
all. This process is called ‘ induction,” and is the scientific 
method or process with which Bacon’s name is generally iden- 
tified, though I need hardly say that it is a process a8 old as 
the human intellect itself. Bacon only insisted on its import- 
ance, and helped to formulate it as an {nstrument for the dis- 
covery of truth. On the other hand, there are some subjects to 
be studied, in which you begin with the large, general, uni- 
versal truth, and proceed afterwards to deduce from this a 
number of special and detailed inferences. Such subjects ar 
said to be studied deductively. In the former the move 
of the thoughts is from the perception of Pare oro m the 
recognition of the general law. In the se eh ‘partic walars

his parents or friends, he reads the history of the past, and by 
putting these experiences together, he arrives inductively at 
the conclusion—that All men are mortal. He accepts this 
proposition. He muses over it. He adds, I too am a man. 
And he concludes, I therefore am mortal. Here the process is 
deductive. And sometimes in learning he must use one process, 
and sometimes another, And it is a great part of the business 
of education so to train the faculties that whichever process we 
adopt we should use it rightly, that our generalizations shall

Science. We shall see hereafter that the physical sciences fur- “nish the best training in inductive reasoning, for there you have in fact. no axioms or admitted truths to start from, and must in all cases begin by the observation of phenomena and the collo- 
cation of experience. But elementary truths about number and about space, which are respectively the bases of arithmetic and geometry, have the great advantage of being very simple and very evident. They lie quite outside the region of contin- eee at Controversy, and they therefore furnish a better bases r purely deductive or synthetic logic than ‘any other class of | s he very data from whi often disputed, or at least disputable” Ch We Proceed are

axioms of geometry and arithmetic. Whatever particular facts 
prove ultimately to be contained in these gencral or universal

we are certain of these.

With my general propositions when I get them, and how to 
deduce right inferences from them; it is clear that I shall 
obtain this sort of discipline best in those departments of 
thought in which the first principles are unquestionably true.

we come to them either by accepting false premises to start

data we start from may be perfectly sound, and yet our con-

sciences,—geometry, arithmetic, algebra, trigonometry, the 
calculus of variations or of curves,—we know at least that 
there is not, and cannot be, error in our first principles, and we 
may therefore fasten our whole attention upon the processes,

questions relating to lines and surfaces would be discussed by 
his disciples. On the contrary, the topics to which he directed 
their attention were some of the deepest problems,—social, 
political, moral,—on which the mind could exercise itself. 
Plato and his followers tried to think out together conclusions 
respecting the being, the duty, and the destiny of man, and the 
relation in which he stood to the gods and to the unseen world. 
What had geometry to do with these things? Simply this: 
That s man whose mind had not undergone a rigorous train- 
ing in systematic thinking, and in the art of drawing legitimate 
inferences from premises, was unfitted to enter on the discus- 
sion of these high topics; and that the sort of logical discipline 
which be needed was most likely to be obtained from geome- 
try—the only mathematical science which in Plato’s time had 
been formulated and reduced to a system. And we in this 
country have long acted on the same principle. Our future 
lawyers, clergy, and statesmen are expected at the University 
to learn a good deal about curves, and angles, and numbers 
and proportions; not because these subjects have the smallest 
relation to the needs of their lives, but because in the very act 
of learning them they are likely to acquire that habit of stead-

things to be received on your testimony with the understanding that they will be explained and veritied afterwards. But here you are justified in saying to your pupil “Believe nothing Which you cannot understand, Take nothing for granted.” In short the proper office of arithmetic is to serve as elementary training in logic. AN through your work as teachers you will bear in mind the fundamental difference between knowing and thinking; and will fee) how much more important relatively to the health of the intellectual life the habit of thinking is than the power of knowing, or even facility in Achieving visible results. But here this principle has special significance, It is by Arithmetic more than by any other subject in a school course that the art of thinking—éonsecutively, closely, logically—can be effectually taught. 
I proceed to offer some practical suggestions as to the man- ner in which this Principle, if once recognized, should domi- nate the teaching of Arithmetic, and determine your methods, You have first of all to take care that so much of our Arith- metical system as is arbitrary and conventional Our artificial shall be shown to be so, and not confounded 2otation. . with that part of Arithmetic which is permanently true, and based on the Properties of number. We have for example adopted the number ten as the basis of our enumeration; but there ig nothing in the science of numbers to suggest this. Twelve or eight, or indeed any other number, might have served the same Purpose, though not with quite the same con: venience, Again the Arabic notation adopts the device of place to show the different values of figures: e.g. In 648 the 6 is shown to mean 6 tens of tens, and the 4 to mean 4 tens, by the place in which they stand. But convenient as this arrange- 
ment is, other devices might, have been adopted, which would have fulfilled the same purpose; and the Roman mode of: repre 
senting the same number by DCXLII may be with advan i compared; and its inconvenience practically tested by trying - sang ii ‘holly artificial and ‘acci Work a sum with it. Again the wholly d measures. has dental way in which our system of weights and mea:

originated should, when the proper time comes, be explained, 
and a comparison be made with some other system, especially 
the French Systéme Métrique. Generally it may be said that 
when you find yourself confronted with any arithmetical de- 
vices or terminology which are arbitrary in their character, you 
will do well to show their arbitrariness by comparing them 
with some others which are equally possible. 
The first occasion comes when you explain the decimal

‘in 8 bags, and 3 remain. The addition of the next line gives 80, 
and shows the need of a device for marking the vacant place, 
and showing that there are no 
odd tens, The 26 hundreds are 
then shown to consist of 2 bas- 
‘kets full containing 10 boxes 
each, and of 6 boxes or hun-

Thus the fundamental parts 
of our system of notation—the 
device of place, the counting by

the need of carrying, are all 
made clear to the eye and to the 
‘understanding of your pupil.

after they have served their purpose, and when the pupil is 
quite ready to deal intelligently with abstract rules. 
One very effective way of making the decimal notation clear 
Seales of is to assume some other number than ten as the 
notation possible base of a system of notation, and to invite 
decimal. the scholars to consider with you how numbers 
would have been represented on that system, It may be 
shown that as a system founded on tens requires nine digits 
and a cipher, so a quaternary system would have required 
three digits only, an wndenary would have required one more 
digit than we use, say ; and that a dénary scheme of notation 
applicable to the highest numbers would have been possible 
with one digit and a cipher only, since all large numbers 
would then have been gathered into tos and powers of two, 
instead of into tens and powers of ten. 
By questions and suggestions you and your scholars come to 
frame on the black-board some such table as this:

When you come to Weights and Measures, and before re- quiring tables to be learned by heart, it is well Lesson on the as I have said to give a short historical lesson Systeme showing how our system grew up. The fact that “¢tiaue. We want fixed units of length, of weight, and of capacity to serve as the basis of all calculation, and the curious fact that nature does not supply by any single object a determinate and unalterable unit of any one of them, will partly account for the queer and irregular way in which we have from time to time based our calculations on grains of barley, on the vibra- tions of the pendulum, or the length of Henry I.’s arm. With 4 good diagram, such as is in use in all the French schools, it may then be shown how the unit of length, the Metre, which forms the base of the metric system, is obtained from the Measurement of a definite part of the earth’s meridian; how this unit squared gives the unit of surface, the Ave; how the same unit cubed gives the units both of magnitude and of capacity, the Litre andthe Stere; how a given bulk so measured of distilled water gives the unit of weight, the Gramme; how a certain weight of silver gives the unit of value, the Franc, and how all these units by a simple nomenclature are subject to decimal multiplication and sub-division. It is only when a simple and scientific system like this is seen in all its details— 
and the whole of it may easily be explained and learned in one 
half-hour’s lesson—that the real nature of the confusion and anomalies of our own system of compound arithmetic comes into clear light.

Arithmetical Parsing. 301 
One very effective way of making the theory of a process 
clear, is to adopt the method to which I may give arithmetical 
the name of “arithmetical parsing.” It consists Psrsing- 
in drawing out before the class the whole of a given process 
without abridgment, and then analyzing it in such a way that a 
separate account shall be given of every figure in succession, 
showing clearly how and why it plays a part in obtaining the 
finalresult. I take an example from Simple Division, although 
almost every other-rule would do as well. I will suppose that 
by simple examples you have shown what Division is, that you 
have deduced from the division of the parts—say of a shilling, 
and from some such example as this: 
Because 27 = 12-+9-+ 6 
Therefore the third of 2% or 42 = 142-+2-+ or 44+8-+2, 
the general truth that ‘“‘we divide one number by another 
when we divide each of the parts of the first successively by the 
second, and add the quotients together.” It is then seen that 
when the dividend is a large number, it has to be resolved into 
such parts as can be dealt with one by one, in order that all the 
several results as they are obtained shall be added together to 
make the whole. An example may be worked thus: Divide

moth and it may be demonstrated that one seventh of two inches is 
the same as two sevenths of one inch. I need not say that in 
your early lessons on fractions, the method of visible illustra- 
tion is especially helpful, and that by drawing squares or other 
figures and dividing them first into fourths and eighths, then 
into thirds, sixths and ninths, or by the use of a cube divided 
into parts, you may make the nature of a fractional expression 
' very evident even to young children, and may deduce several 
of the fundamental rules for reduction to a common denomi- 
nator, and for addition and subtraction, 
Fractions afford excellent discipline in reasoning and reflec- 
tion. No one of the rules should be given on authority, every 
one of them admits of being thonght out and arrived at by the 
scholars themselves, with very little of help and suggestion 
from their teacher. What for example can be more unsatis-

I recommend that after cach of these short exercises the 
numbers be altered, and the scholars required one by one to go

exactly the same purpose as the proving of a theorem in geom-

is, in my opinion, wholly invalid. What do you mean by pro- gress? Ht is surely not hastening to what are called Use of arith- advanced rules. It is rather such increased mas- metical pus- tery of the fundamental principles of arithmetic as will enable the pupil to invent rules for himself. And this he will attain if you set him thinking about the meaning of every Process which you require him to use. Put before your class occasionally little facts about numbers, and ask them to find Out the reasons for them. Here are two or three simple ex- amples of what I mean: 
(@ If the numbers in the following series progress by equal additions 
1-8-5.7-9-11.18. 45.47. 19. 21, why is it that cach pair of numbers, e.g. the first and the last, the second and the last but one, the third and the last but two, etc., equals 22, a number equal to twice 11, the middle term? 
@ If I take any number—say 782586, and any other com- Posed of the same digits, say 257688, and substract ove from the other, thus: 
782586 why is it that the digits of the remainder are sute 
257638 tg give me an exact number of nines 4-+-7+4 TUE gt 4 gag —4 x 9? - 
(©) If I take four numbers in proportion or representing two Yqual ratios, e.g. 6:24 :: 5:20, why is it that 6 times 20 
must equal 24 x 5? 
Tn this last case you will do well to make the scholar deduce 
the equality of the two products as a necessity from the fact. that the four numbers are in proportion. He sees that 24 and 5 make a certain product, and because ax hypothest 6 is as many 
times less than 24 as 20 is more than 5, therefore that the this duct of 6 and 20 must equal that of 5 and 24. And when this 
is seen to be necessarily true of all proportions, the ordinary A when the other three are rule for finding one of the factors n Ives 
given will readily be supplied by the pupils themselves. 20

  Proportion, however, though it is a very interesting and 
Pp 4 valuable part of arithmetical science, and though 
its principles furnish excellent opportunities for 
exercise in logical demonstration, is of less practical utility in 
the solution of problems than the text-books seem to assume. 
The Rule of Three is a great stumbling-block to learners, It 
comes ruch too early in the course, and learned empirically as 
it too often is, it is not readily capable of application to prob- 
lems. Nearly all the questions usually set down under the 
bead of ‘‘ Rule of Three” can be much better solved by simpler 
methods. Such a question as this for example: 
“If 17 articles cost £28 10s, what will 50 such articles 
cost?” 
ought not to be stated and worked as Proportion; but by the 
method of reduction to unity, thus: 
One article must cost £28 10s. +17. Therefore, 50 articles 
£23 103. x 50 m1 ust cost 17 . 
‘Thus the true place for the theory of proportion is after

seen in varied applications,

“96 is the number sought, and is the square root of 676.” 
Really, as I recite it, the rule sounds more like a riddle, or a 
series of instructions in numerical legerdemain, than an appeal 
to the understanding. . Whatever be the accuracy or worth of 
the result produced, it is certain that the process so deseribed 
will do more to deaden than to invigorate the thinking faculty 
of any one who practises it. Morcover, as the rule appears 
utterly arbitrary, the memory will have great difficulty in re 
taining it, and without constant and toilsome practice, will. 
probably not retain it at all. 
Now before describing to you the rational process of attain- 
ing this result, I may remind you that in the The , Syatheti, 
earlier part of arithmetic the rules came in pairs. gal before the

are required to find the whole; and this rule is followed by 
Subtraction, in which you have the whole given and ove of 
the parts, and are required to find the other part. So also in 
Multiplication, the factors are given, and you have to find their 
product; and then there is the inverse process of Division, in 
which the product and.one of the factors are given, and you 
are required to find the other factor. In each case the former 
process is one of synthesis, or putting parts together, and the 
latter process one of analysis or decomposition of parts. But 
we all feel this order to be @ natural and proper one. You | 
would not teach Subtraction before Addition, nor Division be- 
fore Multiplication; because unless @ Jearner in this science first” 
knows how to put the parts together to make the result, he is: 
not in a position, with the result before him, to find out how’ 
that result is produced. Now the rule for finding the square 
root of a number is obviously # rule of decomposition or analy~

ais, and is one of a pair of rules, analogous to Multiptication 
and Division, of which the one shows how to form the second 
power of a number out of the multiples of its parts, and the 
other shows how, when the second power of a number is given, 
to find the parts of that number of which it is the second power. 
But this rule for Evolution presupposes the rule of Tnvolution; 
and cannot, in fact, be properly understood, unless that rule 
has firgt been leamed. Yet in text-books of arithmetic no 
mention is generally made df Involution, but the pupil is in- 
troduced at once to the Extraction of the Square Root. 
Instead therefore of departing from the analogy of the earlier 
rules of arithmetic, and plunging at once into the 
rule for the extraction of roots, before we examine 
the formation of squares, let us begin by trying to find the second 
power of an easy number composed of two parts. Thus: 
Because 11 = 744; then ti x 11 =C7+4 x O44. 
But on multiplying each of these parts of eleven by each of 
the parts of eleven successively, and adding them together, I 
find I have four distinct products, of which the first is the 
square or second power of 7%, the last is the square or second 
power of 4; and the remaining two are alike each being the pro- 
duct of 7 and 4, . Involution. 
44 
aon it x ax 4) =7+4x4 reas x4) =GTB Xs 
2X +P RTF OXY or 9 8K 2816 = 121 
And in this way we may easily arrive at this general truth: 
If a number consists of two parts, the second power of the 
whole number consists of the second power of the first part, together with the second power of the second part, together 
with twice the product of the first and second parts. os 
will suppose that you have, by the help of ried i > help of varied illustra- 
tion, made your pupils perfectly familiar with this proposition

  and led them to recognize it under the general abstract for

You are now in a position to deal with the problem origin- 
ally proposed: Find the square root of 676. Evolution. 
“Tens multiplied by tens give hun- 
dreds, therefore the square root of hun- 
dreds will be tens,

"Take from 676 the square of 2 tens  40\276/6 or 400. = (40 xX 6) 
“There remain 276. “36 = 6 “Therefore, the square root of 676 
is greater than 20, and consists of 20 plus another number.” 
But if so, the remainder 276 must contain not only the square of that other number, but twice the product of the number 20 and that number. With a view to find that number, try how many. times twice 20 are contained in the remainder. The number 6 
appears to fulfil this condition. See now, if 276 contains six times 40, together with 6 times 6, or 6 times 46 in all. If so, 6 is the unit figure of the required root. It has now been shown 
that 676 contains the square of 20, and the square of 6, and. twice the product of 20 and 6, 
or 26 = 20° + 67+ 2 (20 Xx 6) 400+ 36-+ 240 = 676. a

of symbols, no recondite language, nothing but simple numeri- _ 
cal processes, should not be taught on their own merits, and in 
their own proper place. 
An appeal to the eye will greatly help the understanding of 
Anak the rule for the extraction of the square root. A 
érutpe in © square may be erected on a line divided into two 
and Geome- unequal parts, and it will be seen to be separable 
try. into four spaces whose dimensions. correspond to 
the products just given. Afterwards a square on a line divided 
into three or more parts may be shown, and the dimensions of 
the several parts may be expressed in numbers. In like manner 
every proposition in the Second Book of Euclid may be com- 
pared with some analogous proposition respecting the powers 
and products of numbers. But it is important here not to mis- 
take analogy for identity. Some teachers seem to think they 
have proved the theorems in geometry when they have expressed 
the corresponding truths in algebraic symbols. ‘The use of the 
word “ Square,” both for a four-sided figure and for the second 
power of a number, is a little misleading; and Euclid’s use of 
the terms Plane and Solid numbers in his Seventh Book would have further mystified students had it been commonly accepted. But since Geometry is founded entirely on the recognition of the properties of space, and Algebra and Arithmetic on those 
of number, it is necessary to preserve a clear distinction in the reasoning applicable to the two subjects. Except as showing interesting analogies, the t.vo departments of science should be kept wholly separate; and while the truths about the powers and products of numbers should be investigated by the laws of vigoren fem, geometrical demonstrations should be founded Tously on axioms relating to space, and should not - fused by the use of algebraic symbols 10 not be con » Our attention to-day has been necessarily confined to the con- Algebra and sideration of a rational way of treating Arith- Geometry. metic, the one department of mathematics with

  through Geometry, Algebra, Trigonometry, the Calculus, and 
all the later stages of mathematical teaching. While con- 
stantly testing the success of his pupils by requiring problems 
to be worked, he will nevertheless feel that the solution of 
Problems is not the main object of this part of his school dis- 
cipline, but rather the insight into the meaning of processes, and the training in logic. If Algebra and Geometry do not take the student a clearer and more accurate and more con- 
secutive thinker, they are worth nothing. And in the new 
revolt against the long supremacy of Euclid, as represented in 
the Syllabus of the ‘* Association for the Improvement of Geo- 
metrical Teaching,” the one danger we have to fear is that the demonstrative exercises will be cut up into portions too small to 
Sive the needful training in continuity of thought. Euclid, 
with all bis faults, obliges the learner to keep his mind fixed 
not only on the separate truths, but also on the links by which’ 
along succession of such truths are held together. It is well 
to simplify the science of geometry, and to arrange—as the authors of che Syllabus have done—its various theorems in a 
truer order. But since it is not geometry, but the mental. ex- 
ercise required in understanding geometry, which the student 
Most wants to acquire, a system of teaching which challenged 
less of fixed attention and substituted shorter processes for long - 
would possibly prove rather a loss than a gain.

visible relation to the subjects with which we have to deal most 
in after life? Assuredly not. But it is because a certain kind 
of mental exercise, of unquestioned service in connection with 
all conceivable subjects of thought, is best to be had in the 
domain of mathematics, Because in that cee eo oom.

Here, at least, the student moves from step to step, from pre- 
mise to inference, from the known to the hitherto unknown, 
from antecedent to consequent, with a firm and assured tread; 
knowing well that he is in the presence of the highest certitude 
of which the human intelligence is capable, and that these are 
the methods by which approximate certitude is attainable in 
other departments of knowledge. No doubt your mere mathe 
tmatician, if there be such a person,—he who expects to find all 
the truth in the world formulated and demonstrable in the 
same way as the truths of mathematics, is a poor creature, or to 
say the least a very incomplete scholar. But he who has re- 
ceived no mathematical training, who has never had that side 
of his mind trained which deals with necessary truth, and with 
the rigorous, pitiless logic by which conclusions about circles 
and angles and numbers are arrived at, is more incomplete still; 
he ts like one who lacks a sense: for him “ wisdom at one en- 
trance” is “ quite shut out;” he is destitute of one of the chief 
instruments by which knowledge is attained. 
Nor is it enough to regard mathematical science only in its 
far-reaching applications to such other subjects as astronomy 
and physics, or even in its indirect efficacy in strengthening the faculty of ratiocination in him who studies it. There is some- thing surely in the beauty of the truths themselves. We are: the richer—even though we look at them for their own sakes merely—for discussing the subtle harmonies and affinities of number and of magnitude, and the wonderful way in which out of a few simple postulates and germinating truths the mind 
of man can gradually unfold a whole system of new and beau- tifal theorems, expanding into infinite and unexpected uses and.

  AIL GEOGRAPHY AND THE LEARNING OF 
FACTS, 
In considering the subject of Geography we shall do well to 
repeat our former question—Wby teach it at all? Object to be 
‘What purposes do we hope to serve in including ¥ePtin view. 
‘it in our course? We have seen in reference to the teaching of 
languages and of mathematics, that although there were two 
distinct purposes to be kept in view,—the practical and useful application of those studies,on the one hand, and the ‘indirect 
mental discipline afforded by them on the other,—in both cases 
the second object was more important than the first. Here; 
however, it is not so, Our main object in teaching Geography 
is to have certain facts known, because those facts, however 
Jearned, have a value of their own. We live in a beautiful and 
interesting world; one marvellously fitted to supply our wants 
and to provide us with enjoyment; and it seems fitting, if we 
would be worthy denizens of such a home, that we should know 
Something about it, what it looks like, how big it zig mainly 
is, what resources it contains, and what sort of useful as, A formation, lives are lived in it. To know these things is the 
first thing contemplated in teaching Geography. If there be 
mental exercise, and good training in the art of thinking and 
observing to be got out of these studies, they are the secondary 
not the primary objects which we want to attain, Yet even 
here in the one department of teaching in which mere informa- 
tion, as distinguished from scientific method or intellectual train- 
ing, is relatively of the most importance, there are as in other 
subjects, right ways and wrong, intelligent and unintelligent 
methods. The incidental and indirect effect of teaching on the

formation of mental habits is not to be disregarded; and though 
much of the result we hope to gain belongs to the region of 
Yet partly as the memory only, we shall be all the better for in- 
disci quiring whether there is not also room here for 
appeal to the judgment and to the imagination; whe*Zer, in 
short, Geography may not be a really educational instri-r.ent, 
as well as a mass of facts which have to be mastered and com- 
mitted to memory. 
It is the more important to think thus about Geography; be- 
Geography cause I have observed that this is the favorite sub- 
Sonsidersa ject often with the worst and most mechanical

the maximum of visible result may be attained with the mini- 
mum of intellectual effort. To give a few names of piaces 
and point them out on the map, is the easiest of all lessons, 
and, what is more to the purpose, it makes a great show wher itis learned. And when I ask a teacher what is the favorite 
subject of pursuit in his school and he answers Geography. and 
afterwards I find that what is called Geography merely means: 
the knowledge of a number of names, and the power to identify 
their Position on the map, I always draw a very unfavorabie- 
inference respecting the character of that school as a place of 
intellectual training; for I know that such information may have béen imparted without the least excrtion of educating

modern times. 
Now in considering how we should teach Geography, we 
may usefully fall back on a principle we have had pow to ar- 
before—that we should begin with what is known rive at right 
and what is near, and let our knowledge radiate methods. 
from that as a centre until it comprehends that which is larger 
and more remote. This principle is specially applicable to the 
Present subject. You want of course to give right general notions 
of the surface and configuration of the earth, and of the mean- 
ing and useofamap. The best way to begin is to draw a little 
ground-plan of the school-room; and put into it one after an- 
other, as the children watch you and make their suggestions, 
the desks, the tables, and other articles. Train them to observe 
you as you draw, and to correct you if you put a door into the 
wrong place, or make the line which represents a desk of dis- 
proportionate length, Then try a map of the surroundings of 
the school-room, its playground, the street in which it stands, 
the principal roads near, and put in one after another the church, 
the railway station, a river, a bridge, and other familiar objects, 
at the same time inviting each child to put into the map in its 
Proper place his own home. Thus they will learn the meaning 
and right-usc of a map, and will feel a good deal of interest when 
they see it grow before them under your hand as you draw it 
on the board and fill in one detail after another, Without some 
such previous explanation and actual manufacture of a. plan 
before the eyes of the children, an ordinary printed map of 
Europe or of the world is nothing but a colored enigma.

the first in a geographical course. Perhaps yoU Home Geo-

pared to push a theory—even one which is founded, as this is, 
on a true principle—to an impracticable and absurd extent. 
‘We must learn to think of the various parts of knowledge, not 
only in what seems their natural sequence, but also in the light 
of their relative importance., You cannot measure the value of 
geographical facts by a formula, or say that their importance 
diminishes as the square of the distance. The earliest geo- 
graphical ideas may well be those derived from home and its 
surroundings; but these ideas require next to be properly local 
ized, and shown in relation to the size and form of the world 
itself. A good way of doing this is first to help the children 
to refer the map of the school and its surroundings to an ord- 
nance map of the parish or division of the county; then to mark 
this larger division on a map of England, afterwards to show 
England on a map of Europe, and then identify it on a globe. 
Thus by degrees you establish a sense of proportion, and help 
the child to see his bearings, so to speak, and the place he 
occupies in the universe. And this done, it is well to proceed at once, by the help of a globe, to give some very general 
notion of the shape and size of the earth, the distribution of land and water, the four cardinal points, and the meaning of 
the simpler geographical terms. To make these lessons intelligible you will need pictures or

that the sun, though seen by us always to the cal fac 
south at noon, is seen by people on the equator over their heads, 
and by people living south of the equator’to the north of them 
at that hour. But it is not at this stage expedient to include 
any details about meridians, or the measurement of latitude and _ 
Jongitude by degrees. Afterwards it seems best to proceed at 
once to the general geograpby of England, with especial refer- 
ence to the county in which the scholar lives, to its boundaries, 
its hills and rivers and principal towns. Next in order should come a general description of the chief countries of Europe

Scotland and Ireland in detail, and then latitude and longitude 
and as much else in the way of descriptive geography as you 
have time to give. In French schools, little manuals of what 
we should call County Geography are in extensive use, There 
is one for each Department; but a little prefatory chapter about 
the size and shape of the world, the points of the compass, and 
the position of France upon the globe, forms a common intro- 
duction to all the manuals alike. There is a map of the De- 
partment; an account of its name, size, limits, area, its chief 
industries and geological formation, its natural productions, the 
famous men it has produced, its historic associations, and a 
great number of details, administrative, statistical, commercial; 
besides engravings of the cathedral of the chef-lew, and of any 
buildings, monuments, or scenes for which the Department is 
famed. The French child is generally expected to master this

  important. The compilers of such books must arrange their 
facts in a certain order so as to be easy of reference. So they 
are fain to begin with Europe, then to take Asia, then Africa, 
then America, and finally Australia; and in the hands of a 
mere routine teacher, the patient school-boy,—‘‘ for sufferance 
is the badge of all his tribe,’—is forced to learn a good deal 
about Denmark and the Caucasus, about the Burrampooter and 
the Lake Nyanza, before he knows anything of New York or

yourselves not only what are the facts to which the books and | 
the examiners assign prominence; but what are the facts which 
it behoves a well-instructed and intelligent person to know. A. 
great many names and statistics are learned by school-boys 
which no educated person is expected to know, or would care - 
to remember if he did. To some extent this is inevitable; but 
there would not be so large a discrepancy between the sort of. 
knowledge a school-boy has from his lesson-book, and the sort 
of knowledge of which you yourself feel most the need when 
you mingle in society, or read a piece of contemporary history, - 
if teachers thought oftener of the occasions on which geograph- 
ical knowledge is wanted and the uses to which it has to be 
put. . 
I will add some miscellaneous suggestions about geographical 
teaching: .

Slobe. side of one representing Europe, and is generally 
quite as large, and there is no way of rectifying the impression 
except by showing the position and relative sizes of both on the 
globe. The old globes in stands are far Jess useful than port- 
able globes. I need hardly say that a celestial globe is utterly 
misleading. Use the globe also to show how the sun comes on 
to the meridian of different places in succession at different 
times; and from the fact that the earth revolves round its axis in 
24 hours, deduce a rough general rule for determining the times 
at different places, according to the number of degrees of 
longitude, For example you point out that in our Lat., 514 N., 
the value of a degree of longitude is to that of a degree of 
longitude on the great circle of the equator as 87 to 60, Say 
approximately then that as the great circle as well as all the 
parallels of latitude are divided into 860 degrees, and as the 
earth revolves in 24 hours, 15 degrees on any parallel represents 
an hour’s difference of time; but 15° on the equator mean yr of a circumference of 24000 miles: hence on the equator 1000 
miles E. or W. represent a difference of one hour in time. But 
in our latitude we may reckon that about 600 miles E, or W. 
Tepresent an hour; and that thus a telegram from Constanti- 
nople which is about 30 degrees to our E. or about 1200 miles, 
and which has the sun on its meridian two hours before us, may be delivered in London apparently at an earlier hour than | that at which it is transmitted. At this moment, e.g. it is 2 o'clock here, it is 4 at Constantinople, and it is quite conceivable

fashioning for yourself a map, such as bas been described, of the 
parish or district in which the school is situated, seek to enlist 
the services of the children themselves; and invite them to sug- 
gest other objects or places, and when they make a copy of it, 
require each scholar to put into position and to mark specially 
the site of neighboring buildings, as well as of the school, and 
their proper distances. 
Do not rely wholly on maps with names printed on them. 
The habit of setting children to look vaguely for ‘The use of 
a place on the map, which merely means looking ™@Ps- 
for a certain printed word, is very useless. Nothing is learned 
-of the true position of countries by this means. The best maps 
are outline maps on a large scale without names; and best of 
all those which are drawn in outline by the teacher himself on 
a black-board, and filled in item by item, as each new fact is 
elicited by questions or descriptions. And do not forget that 
the knowledge of the mere names and positions of places is 
worth little or nothing unless the scholar has some interesting 
associations with them. If you are asked to learn the name 
and position of a place per se, the memory refuses and rightly 
refuses to retain it, because it has no organic connection with 
anything else you know or wish to know. The best knowledge 
of mere topography is gained incidentally, in connection with 
reading lessons, with lessons on history or familiar objects, with 
the tracing of imaginary voyages and travels. The map should 
be always at hand, and when referred to in order to identify a 
place, of which you are learning something else than its mere 
geographical position, is seen to serve a useful purpose and 
helps to impress a fact on the memory. Indeed every time a 
map is referred to for such a purpose, something is done to im- 
press geographical facts on the eye. And this itself is a useful lesson. °

all those facts which are the result of man’s residence on the 
earth. But the second class of facts is nearly always to be 
accounted for by a study of the first. The earth is wonder- 
fully designed for human habitation. Tt is our granary, our 
vineyard, our lordly pleasurc-house. In some parts nature is 
bountiful, in others penurious; over some she sheds beauty, in 
others she offers material prosperity: at one place she hides 
treasure, at another she spreads it on the surface, In some 
Places she invites neighboring peoples to intercourse, in others 
she erects impenetrable barriers between them: in some she 
lures the inhabitants to peaceful prosaic industry, in others 
terrifies them by displays of awful and inexplicable forces. 
And even of those regions which she seems not to have de- 
signed for our use—the torrid desert, the lonely rocky moun- 
tains, and the mysterious ice-bound regions of the poles, may 
we not truly say, that they too are part of the bountiful pro- 
vision she has made for our many-sided wants? For they im- 
press and exalt our imagination, they minister to our sense of 
beauty; and yet at the same time they humble our pride, and 
make us feel that there is something more in the world than is 
immediately and easily intelligible to us. They give us in 
short a sense of the mystery, the vastness and the sumptuous- 
ness of the world, which is very necessary for a right estimate 
of our own true place in it. 
And with such considerations before us we see how curiously

climate—a climate of which Charles II. said that it allowed 
men to go about their work with less interruption and on 
@ greater number of days than in any other country in the 
world; and you cannot dissociate the thought of our insular 
position, our climate and -resources, from the character and 
history of our people. Take Holland as another example. It 
is low, flat, moist; hence suited for pasture rather than tillage; 
hence favorable for the rearing of cattle, for butter and for 
cheese; and because so low that the encroachments of the sea 
¢an only be prevented by enormous and costly dykes, and by 
incessant watchfulness, its inhabitants are distinguished by. 
foresight and endurance, by thrift and industry; and because 
for these reasons the scenery is flat, dull, and uninspiring, the 
inhabitants are not distinguished by the wealth of their im- 
agination or the splendor of their literature. . : 
Look again at the vast alluvial plains watered by the Nile, the. 
Euphrates, the Indus, and the Yellow River. The 
soil is rich, the wants of the people few, the induce- of the effect 
ment to exertion small. There you have found in gonditions on 
all ages of the world a teeming population, agri- pational his- 
cultural and stationary, attached to the soil, con- . 
servative in habits of thought, easily subjugated and kept in: 
subjection; and there have been appropriately placed the great 
despotic monarchies. On the other hand, Jook at small mari- : 
time states like ancient Phoenicia, Greece, and Italy, separated: © 
by ridges of hills, inhabited by little communities, isolated, yet. 
compelled sometimes to fight for their liberty; hence jealous of 
each other, and hence self-asserting, their history full of records: 
of intestine divisions, and of heroic struggles for liberty. Here : 
you cannot fail to see a connection between the free vigorous 
life of early Rome and of the Etruscan and Greek republics,” 
and the physical conditions under which the people lived. 
Or contrast with the great communities which have formed. 
the Egyptian, the Assyrian, and the Chinese Empires, the state 
of the people on the Great Tartar steppes where herbage is 
scanty, where a settled habitation is almost impossible, and:
-P-A-G-E-325
824 Geography and the Learning of Facets. 
  
where nomadic, and therefore restless, wild, suspicious, and 
warlike races find an appropriate home. In like manner you 
may trace the influence of climate in some countries by the 
way in which it enervates the laborer, and in others by the way 
in which it impels him to excrtion and calls out his higher 
qualities, You may even see how the aspects of nature affect 
the national character in many places: for where physical phe- _ 
nomena are equable and uniform as in temperate climates, and 
tan has learned how to control nature, you find often a reso- 
lute self-reliant people, proud of their strength and encouraged 
to use it; but in regions subject to frequent earthquakes and 
convulsions, where the aspects of nature are formidable, and 
its phenomena on too vast a scale to be subject to human con- 
trol, you will often find a timorous superstitious people, with- 
out enterprise or any of that cheerful nope which animates to 
intrepid discoveries and great inventions. 
I must not stay now to pursue this line of inquiry. Those 
of you who would like to sce how fertile such researches are, 
‘will do well to read the second chapter of Buckle, “on the in- 
fluence exercised by physical laws over the organization of 
society and the character of individuals,” and in that chapter 
you will find, amidst much which is crude and speculative, and a few unverified and hasty generalizations, many valuable truths and suggestive hints, In Mr. Grove’s excellent little book on Geography you will find similar material. But I want 
you to feel that physical geography is the basis of all true geo- srephical teaching, that here, as in other subjects, it is not then teats which ‘are of vate, bat also the tie that binds administration and comme mere topography —all political 
ynistratio ercial geography must ultimately con- nect itself with a right understandi of i ES ing of such matters as soil climate, shape, size, geology, and , . . OBy, natural resources.

will give new meaning to bis lessons; will be able to say, e.g., 
how.the presence of chalk or sandstone may be recognized by 
the contour of the bills. 
Another kind of tie by which mere geographical facts may 
be bound together is the historical. Associate Historical 
therefore, as often as possible, the description of associations. 
Places with the memory of events which bave happened in 
them, “The man,” says Johnson, ‘‘is little to be envied 
whose patriotism would not gain force on the plains of Mara- 
thon, or whose piety would not grow warmer among the ruins 
of Iona.” Association between the configuration of a region; 
and a great event that has happened in it, is a great help to the 
recollection both of history and geography too. Nobody can

cal study. And if in the neighborhood of your school there 
is any spot or building rendered illustrious by its association 
witb historical events, seck as far as you can to explain that 
association, and give interest to it.

Further, the skilled teacher of geography ought to cultivate 
Power of in himself the power of vivid and picturesque 
verbal de- verbal descriptions of the aspect and contour of 
seription. any country he has seen. You can only acquire 
this power by caring about such details, It is well known that 
Arnold’s lessons to his Sixth Form on history, when. he was 
reading Livy or the Anabdasis, were wonderfully vivified by 
his striking descriptions of the country in which the events 
took place. When he travelled, he kept his eyes always open, 
and it is remarkable how often in his letters to old pupils, who 
had gone to some distant country, he wrote to them hinting at 
the kind of things which an observant man would do well to 
look for, and asking for the result of such observation for his own information and enjoyment. Here is part of such a letter 
written to Mr. Gell, who had gone to reside in Tasmania: ‘TI 
hope you jourialize largely. Every tree, plant, stone, and 
living thing is strange to us in Europe, and capable of afford- 
ing interest. Will you describe to me the general aspect of the 
country round Hobart Town? To this day I never could meet 
with a description of the common face of the country about 
New York or Boston, or Philadelphia, and therefore I have no distinct ideas of it. Is your country plain or undulating, your valleys deep or shallow, curving, or with steep sides and flat bottoms? Are your fields large or small, parted by hedges or stone walls, with single trees about them or patches of wood here and there? Are there many scattered houses, and what are they built of—brick, wood, or stone? And what are the hills and streams like—ridges or with waving summits,—with Plain sides or indented with combs, full of springs or dry, and 
what is their geology? I can better fancy the actors when I have a notion of the scene on which they are acting.”

ascent of Mount Ararat, or some of the passages from Hook-

‘Wills’s Wanderings in the High Alps. In this department of 
teaching it is pre-eminently needful that the teacher should

‘perience will also help him to give vividness to his Jessonis, After a foreign journey he will invite his class to have a Iesson on the Rhine, on the aspect of the medieval towns of Belgium 
or North Italy, on an Alpine ascent, on the English Cathedrals, 
or the English Lakes, Photographs and pictures from illus- 
‘ated journals will all help to give reality to the impressions you want to convey. 
Do not complain of all this as desultory and unscientific. Remember that this is the one subject in which you are least bound to preserve any predetermined order, and in which mis-

tial exactness the populations, and the latitude and Jongitude 
of all the capital cities in the two hemispheres, and the names 
and lengths of all the rivers in the world. But if you do this, 
you may be well content with almost any portion of the sub- ject which is thoroughly mastered. For he who has been led. 
even by accident, or the course of your special experience, to 
examine one or two countries, to get a mental picture of their

ought to be studied, and will—as the reading and experience of after-life cause him to be interested one by one in other countries—know better how to obtain his information and to make a right use of it, 
Although all these considerations point to the necessity of oral lessons, Iam far from saying that you should be content. With the somewhat vague and miscellaneous impressions which. stich teaching, if relicd upon alone, is apt to leave. Text- books, catalogues, tables, statistical statements, and memory- work have their value, and must be resorted to by all who wish to give definiteness to such lessons. But the time to use them is after the oral teaching, not before it or instead of it. 
Geography is a good type of that class of subject which has. Feetlore, its chief value as information useful in itself, and. 
which has comparatively few ramifications into- other regions of acquirement or of intellectual life. There is a large mass of serviceable knowledge which does not come within the ordinary range of school subjects, and which yet a school might help to impart—knowledge about the substances. we see and handle, about the objects around us, about the things which are going on in the world. We must not, in our zeal for those parts of instruction which are specially educa- tive, lose sight of the value of even empirical instruction.about. these things. To impart facts is not a teacher's highest busi- ness, but it is a substantial part of his business. It is so, not. merely because it ig disgraceful for a person to be ill-informed. about common things, It is pitiable to measure the worth of any knowledge merely by the degree in which it is a credit to. gain it, or a discredit to be without it. The best reasons for seeking to give to your pupils a good basis of facts are that the. Possession of them is very useful; that all future scientific gen: eralization presupposes them; that they furnish pabulum for the thought and the imagination; and generally that life is rich and interesting in Proportion to the number i and cae ane P er of things we know

So at every part of a school course provision should be made 
for instruction in matters of fact which lie outside the domain 
of the regular book-subjects. What is known in the German 
schools as Natur-kunde and Erd-kunde fulfils this description Most nearly, But both terms are restricted as to the class of topics they include. The information or useful knowledge, 
now in view, can perhaps be best described by the bybird term Fuct-lore. It has, no donbt, a definite educational pur- 
ose, and may help to develop faculty in a useful way. But its main object is to supply facts, to excite an intelligent in- terest in the common objects and phenomena which surround the scholars to teach them how to see and to handle, and to 
draw simple inferences from what the senses tell them, and 
to prepare the way for the later and more regular study of 
science. 
In Infant Schools this aim is accomplished by means of what 
e called Object lessons. A teacher takes a piece objectdes- 
$f Coal in his hand and asks the children what it 62> 4s. He asks them to look at it, and tell him what they can see, that it is black and shiny; to handle it, and to find out that it 
is hard, that parts of it are easily rubbed 6ff, and that it is of a 
certain weight. He asks what would happen if he put it into the fire, and he finds that they can tell him not ‘only that it 
burns, but that there is a gaseous flame at first, afterwards o 
duller burning, apd finally nothing left but cinders. He 
makes them tell i tna uses. Then he asks if they would 
like to know something/more about it, and he proceeds to show a picture of a coal-mine, to describe the gloom, the heat of the 
Pit, the mode of getting down to it and out of it, and the dan- 
gers to which miners are exposed. He tells them how many 
ages ago all this coal was vegetable matter; be produces a

the mode of procuring it. 
All this is wel, and in the hands of a good teacher fulfils 
Their chort- valuable purposes. It has in it some of the cha-

distinctly beyond that range. It is well calculated to awaken 
curiosity and to stimulate the observing and inquiring faculty. 
But, then, like so many other good things, it is apt to degen- 
erate. Pestalozzi, David Stow, and the Mayos have laid down 
rules; model lessons have been published, and accordingly it is 
my lot to hear a number of so-called object lessons, which are 
very barren of any useful result whatever. Because Dr. Mayo’s 
book on object lessons gives a list of the qualities of glass— 
Brittle, Transparent, Hard, Fusible, Useful, Inelastic, ete., one 
is doomed to hear one object after another treated in exactly 
the same way, and to see it solemnly recorded on a board that 
a cow is graminivorous, or that an orange is opaque. The 
black-board exercise is a great stumbling-block to unskilful teachers. They are told beforehand at the Training Colleges. that it should present at the end of the lesson a complete sum- 
". Mary; arranged under heads, of all that the lesson contains, and 80 they exhibit throughout the lesson a much greater anxiety 
to get the matter on to the board than to get it into the under- standing of the scholars. Moreover, lessons of this kind are 
apt to be desultory and unconnected, and to be given at irregu- lar intervals, And although they occur in the Infant Schools: with marked. advantage under the name of “

reference to the regular instruction in science which is intended 
to be taken up hereafter. The scientific spirit and the scientific 
method should be present, but should not be obtruded. Scien- 
tific nomenclature should be sparingly used, and then only when 
the need for it has become apparent. It is well that children 
should be made, even in the lowest classes, to think about the 
formation of a glacier, the boiling of water, or the making of 
iron into steel. But each separate fact of this sort should be 
correlated with some other which is like it, so that an elemen- 
tary perception at least may be gained of the nature of physical 
law. 
Be careful to consider beforehand how much can be reason- 
‘They should ably taught in the thirty or forty minutes you

most of these lessons is that they attempt too much. Consider 
well that you have need at the end of cach division of the sub- 
ject to recapitulate very carefully, and to make sure that you 
have been followed; and that certain facts must be accentuated 
by repetiion and by writing. Do not let any one lesson con- 
tain a greater number of new truths or thoughts than can be 
fairly grasped and remembered in one short effort; or than can 
be so fitted together as to leave on the mind a sense of unity and completeness,

Dee, ot oad the lesson proceeds, and use it rather for record- aa ing your principal conclusions, at the end of each 
division of your subject, than as a promise,—or menace,—be- forehand of what you are going todo. I have often heard lit- 
tle collective lessons, in which the teacher says “now we are Bee pel of the ‘qualities;’” and then the word “quali- ; avely written down on the board; and one by one various adjectives are evolved and written underneath it, AN this chills and repels the child and destroys his interest in. the lesson.

about. But if you will first interest him in the thing and make 
him care about it; then discuss in succession its various parts, 
attributes and uses; there is no harm afterwards in recalling 
what has been learned, and saying ‘‘ We have in fact all this 
while been finding out the qualities of this thing; and we will 
write them down.” But it is not at all necessary to enumerate 
all the qualities of each object as it comes under review. When 
this is.done, the lessons on objects soon become monotonous 
and very wearisome. Each object has some one quality which 
it Mustrates better than another. Thus a chief characteristic 
of glass is its transparency, of India-rubber is its elasticity, of 
Sold is ils ductility; and in a lesson on each of these objects it is well to take the opportunity of calling attention to the oné 
or two technical terms which the particular object best ilus- 
trates. 
No single lesson should have many technical or unfamiliar 
terms in it, But every good lesson should at least Technical ~ 
introduce the learner to two or three new technical ras. 
words, and make a distinct addition to his vocabulary. Every 
lesson in fact brings to light some name or formula which is 
Specially characteristic of the new knowledge you are impart- 
ing, and will form a good centre round which recollections will 
cluster and arrange themselves after you have done. All such 
characteristic terms, names and formule, should be very dis-

In thinking out the plan of any such oral lesson, ét is very necessary to break it up into definite portions, that you may 
know at what points to recapitulate. But it is not necessary te

must have a beginning, a middle and an end, and will be map- 
ent Ped out in your mind with this view; but there ia 
of each lesson no need to divide it ostentatiously into parts before- 
hand, and say what you are going todo. A logical 
division of the subject is necessary for you as part of your plan 
of workmanship, but the consciousness of this division is not 
always helpful to the learner, He is not concerned with the 
mechanism of teaching or with the philosophy of your art. 
He has to be interested, to be led by ways which he knows not, 
but which you know, and have clearly predetermined. But to 
begin with any display of the logical framework of your lesson 
is to begin at the wrong end. Not to speak it profanely, do 
not some of us,—patient hearers in church—feel a little rebelli- 
ous when a preacher announces beforehand his intention to 
divide his discourse into three parts, and then to conclude with 
‘am appeal and application. We feel instinctively that the 
whole mechanism of firstly, secondly, and thirdly, was perhaps 
very useful to him when marshalling his own thoughts in his 
study beforehand, but that it is no business of ours. We are 
very ready to welcome the facts, the teaching, the reasoning, 
the inspiration, it may be, which he has to give; but the more 
he can keep his homiletic apparatus in the background the

aims at helping learners to realize the aspects of nature; Com- mercial Geography, which concerns itself with manufactures

in fact? which deserves to rank as science. We are to keep 
these three forms of geographical teaching separately in view 
and to take care that each receives the consideration which is 
due to it and no more. 
The recognition of this distinction will not be without its 
value in connection with the whole class of information of 
which Geography may serve as a type. I hope hereafter to say 
something more as to the place which physical and inductive 
science should hold in a high or complete course of instruction.

impression that even in the lower department of school life the 
claims of such knowledge ought to be distinctly recognized, and 
that they are best recognized by planning out in regular series, . .

opinion passes on its absence.” And he proceeds to show that 
the fundamental objection to such masses of facts as children 
are often required to learn is that they are undigested and un- 
organizable, that there is no unity about them, and therefore no 
scientific value in them. Now for my part, I do not think this 
a reason for omitting the study of History from a school-course, 
but simply for inquiring how the facts can be so taught as to 
serve a real educational purpose. 
Nothing is easier than to begin by denouncing the school- 
books. No doubt they are all more or less unsat- 
isfactory. Yet it is difficult to know how if they 
honestly fulfil their intended purpose they could be otherwise. 
They must, of course, be crammed with facts; and as style 
must always be more or less sacrificed to the desire for exces- 
sive condensation, they are seldom very readable or interesting. 
Moreover, since the writer of a school-book naturally strives to 
narrate as large a number of authentic facts as his space will 
contain, it is often unavoidable that important and unimportant 
facts will be recorded with the same amount of elaboration, and 
that thus, much which is of little value will be minutely set 
forth, The more systematic text-books also attempt a classifi- 
cation of the main facts of each reign, under such heads as 
“birth and parentage of the sovereign, eminent men, wars,” 
etc. Now, although this looks methodical, and is, indeed, very 
helpful to the utility of the book considered as a work of refer- 
ence, it destroys its value as a book to be read. Nobody acquires 
a knowledge of historical facts in this formal way. To begin 
with, classification of this kind, is to begin at the wrong end. 
It is only after a general interest has been awakened in the story 
of the reign, and after some of the important facts have laid 
hold upon the mind, that the use for such classification arises, 
or the necessity of it is felt. 
In spite, however, of these drawbacks, the use of text-books 
is a necessity, if you would avoid vagueness and teach history 
methodically. Let the book, however, be treated as supple- 
mentary and wholly subordinate to oral lessons, and be used for

reference and home study mainly, and then it falls into its 
Books useful, Proper place. But if it be used in class at all let 
subordinate it be read aloud, explained, amplified, commented 
on, and made vividly interesting, before you re- 
teaching. quire any of it to be learned as a lesson. Then 
by way of giving concentration and definiteness to what you 
have taught, it is not unreasonable to expect the bare facts as 
given in your school manual to be got up, copied out and re- 
membered, though not of course to be learned by heart in the 
precise words of the book. 
These two objects (1) To make history stimulating to the

curate and well-arranged facts for fature use and generalization, 
will be before you. To cate about the first object exclusively 
is to incur the risk of a relapse into slovenly teaching, and vague 
picturesque impressions. To be satisfied with the second only 
is to incur the yet greater risk of turning the most interesting 
and humaniziug of all studies into a dull and joyless mnemonic, 
and so of giving your pupil a distaste for History which will 
ast for life. 
Has it ever occurred to you to ask how it is that so many of 
"The Bible us have a much clearer knowledge of the history 
& model of of the Jews, than of our own annals? Is it not be- 
v cause the Bible is in one respect the model of all 
history? Look at it without reference to its higher claims, 
simply asa piece of narrative. Consider how it is that it con- 
(revs to its readers so clear and full a knowledge of Jewish his- 
Htory during many centuries. There is, for example, a period 
of about one thousand years, from Abraham to Rehoboam, and 
how is the history of the time told? We have first the story 
of the patriarch’s personal career. We are led to understand 
his character and his motives; we see him as the centre of a 
scene in which pastoral life is attractively portrayed, and which 
affords us glimpses of the patriarchal government, of life and 
manners, and of the social and domestic conditions of the time.

life. The current of human events, as it is described in the 
sacred writings, is not like that stream of uniform breadth 
and depth which text-books seem to describe, and which we see 
often depicted in chronological charts, It rather resembles a

tural story of the people of Israel curiously resembles the actual 
knowledge which even the most accomplished historical scholar 
possesses. That it is adapted to the nceds and conditions of the 
human understanding will be evident to any one who will take 
the trouble to recall his own experience, and will remember 
how he has secured one after another certain fixed points of 
interest, has grouped round them, little by little, the facts which 
he has subsequently acquired, filled up the intervals of time 
between them by slow degrees, but to the last has continued to 
retain his hold on these fixed points, and to refer every new ac- 
quisition to some one or other of them. 
I do not say that it is possible or even desirable that school- 
books on English History should be made to conform to the 
Bible type in this respect. It is not safe to leave to the compil- 
ers of such books the task of determining what part of our an- 
nals shall be overlooked, and it is quite necessary that teachers 
should themselves exercise some discretion in this matter, 
selecting and adapting their historical lessons according to the 
age and capacity of the children, and to the probable duration 
of their stay atschool. But if it be, indeed, certain that careful 
readers of the Bible obtain a truer insight into the character and 
polity, the manners, progress, and national life of a people than. 
is to be secured, with the same degree of attention, from a 
modern compendium of English history, the fact is certainly a 
significant one, and wifl be found to suggest some important 
practical inferences. 
OF these the most obvious is, that it is better to master the 
The eat a great and eventful periods than to go on continu- 
telearned in OUSly in the way suggested by the form of a text- 
detail first: book. We said in Geography that there was abso- 
lutely no sequence for mere topographical facts; that no one 
gach fact had any real priority over another except in so far ag

accident‘or association rendered it useful to the learner. Hence 
it was expedient for the teacher to emancipate himself complete- 
ly from the text-books, and to teach the mere facts of political 
Geography in any order he liked. But in history there is of 
course a natural order, that of chronological sequence; and if 
life were long enough, and if all events and periods were equally 
worth studying, this would be the true order of teaching. But 
as matter of fact the order of the relative significance and 
value of events is of far more importance than their chronologi- 
cal order, and. does not in any way correspond to it. 
How then should we begin to teach English History? Not 
certainly by plunging at once into the story of The frst 
Julius Cesar and the Druids; nor by giving a lessons. 
number of dates to be learned, to form a framework for pictures 
we mean to paint. 1 should first give a short series of lessons 
either orally, or from a well-written reading book if I could find 
one, with a view to make some simple and fundamental histori- 
cal ideas intelligible—a State, a nation, a dynasty, a monarch, a 
parkament, legislation, the administration of justice, taxes, civil 
and foreign war. Scholars would thus see what sort of matter 
History had to do with, and would be prepared to enter on the 
study with more interest. Then a general notion should be 
given of the number of centuries over which our History ex- 
tends. A general outline of the period of time to be covered 
is necessary in order that each fact as it is known may ‘be local- 
ized and referred to its due position among other facts. Thus 
a sort of Time-map divided into 19 centuries is roughly con- 
structed, on the same principle as that which would lead the 
teacher to Jay down the meridian lines of a geographical map 
before he drew it and filled in all its parts. But as soon as this 
is done the task of selection begins. He is by no means bound 
to follow blindly the course prescribed by the text-book. On 
the contrary, it will be far better to fix upon the most character- 
istic periods, to cause them to be studied with fulness and exact- 
ness, and to reserve the chronicle of the less notable reigns until 
afterwards. The times of Egbert, of the Conqueror, of Eliza

beth, of the Protectorate, of Anne, and of George III., are turning-points in our history. The person who understands 
these well is, as far as history is concerned, a well-informed 
" man, even though he is unable to repeat in due order the list of 
sovereigns, and to tell their relationship to each other. For all 
the higher purposes contemplated in the study, a thorough 
acquaintance with the state of England in one or two of the 
most eventful periods is of far more value than a superficial 
knowledge of the entire history. The latter may be forgotten. 
There is no germinating power in it; it will neither grow when 
the pupil carries it with him into the world of books, and of 
news, and of conversation; nor furnish material for reflection 
in solitary hours. But the former serves as a nucleus for future 
acquirement. A learner who has been led to pay special atten- 
tion to one period, and to master all its differentia, carries away 
with him from school not only a fund of knowledge which will 
hold together and retain its place in the mind, but also right 
notions of what historical investigation really is, and of the 
manner in which the annals of a period should hereafter be 
studied. In short, it is by no means necessary that a pupil 
should take with him into the world all the facts of a school- 
history, but it ¢ necessary that he should be provided with a taste for historical reading, and with both the power and the 
disposition to study the subject systematically for himself. And this object is far more likely to be obtained by judiciously selecting and dwelling on the prominent epochs than by the ordinary routine method. 
A good deal is often said as to the value of chronology, which ogy. Some have called one of the eyes of History. Mr. Fearon says dates are to History what the multipli- cation table is to Arithmetic; Iam not quite prepared to admit the analogy inthiscase. The multiplication table has two charac- teristics: Itis constantly wanted in every sum we work; and every fact in it is of equal value. That 7 nines are 68 is just as liable to be wanted in Arithmetic as the fact that 2sixes are 12. Butof dates we may safely say that there are many degrees of useful-

ness in them, some being very valuable and others very worth- 
less; And if the principle I have tried to lay down is a true 
one fa regard to the study of periods of history, that principle 
will lead us to discriminate between the dates which we may 
wisely take some trouble to retain as fixed points in the 
memory, and those dates which none but a pedant would value, 
and which even a well-instructed man would not care to remem- 
ber, I may confess to you—though with real deference to the 
judgment of many who think differently—that I do not see 
tmauch use in knowing the date of an event, without knowing 
something about the event itself. If welJearn dates as and when 
we study the events, the two together have a meaning anda 
value; but the date itself and apart is of little worth. If we 
examine our own mental history a little we shall find that such 
‘chronology as we thoroughly know and has become part of our 
permanent possessions connects itself with prominent and inter- 
esting events, and has been added to piecemeal as our knowledge 
of history increases. We study a fact, become sensible of its 
importance, and then we remember the date. 
. For example, in English History the dates of Julius Cesar, 
the first Christian mission, Alfred, the Conquest, pates to be 
John and Magna Charta, Edward III. and Chau- Jeamed es 
eer, Henry VIII. and the Reformation, Elizabeth known.notin- 
and the Armada, the execution of Charles I., the dependently. 
Restoration, the Revolution of 1688, the great year of Minden 
and’ Quebec, the loss of America, the French Revolution, 
Waterloo, are the fixed centres round which a large part of our 
annals may be said to revolve. 
I know an admirable teacher of History who relies most on 
good oral lessons for teaching this subject; but p,sctical 
who has adopted the plan of printing on a card, use of 
and placing in the hands of every boy, a list con- Pp " 
taining in bold type about twenty of these dates. There is 
thus a sort of curte du pays under the eye of the scholar, 
‘and as each fact is named, it is identified with one of the 
dates, Then for an advanced class, there is a larger card,
-P-A-G-E-345
344 History. 
ne 
which contains some 50 dates in all, the original 20 being in 
somewhat larger type, and the minor or new dates smaller, In 
the highest class a third card is used with about a hundred 
dates, or 50 in addition to those already known; the whole 
being printed in three kinds of type to mark the different de- 
grees of importance in the events. Thus certain fixed land- 
marks are put before the scholars. ‘As each event is discussed. 
and Jearned, they associate the date with it; and as they read. 
more of history, they establish fresh halting-places, put each 
new fact into its proper interval, and so these intervals become:

of learning dates, as adjuncts to our historical knowledge, as- 
helps in systematizing and arranging facts which we already 
know, not as facts or pieces of knowledge of any value in. 
themselves. 
Observe to what absurd devices we are led when we accept: 
Muemonic chronology as a thing to be learned per se. One 
of teacher maps out the ceiling of a room, and asso- 
mology.  ciates dates with particular portions of a diagram, 
the form of which is supposed to be printed on the Jearner’s- 
brain. Another invents a memoria technica, in which certain 
letters stand for figures. Thus you have the first syllable of a 
sovereign’s name, and then a syllable made up of letters repre- 
senting the date of his accession. And in some Jadies’ schools. 
L have met with systems of metrical chronology, short rhymed 
couplets so formed that the initial letters either of the alternate: 
words or of the nouns shall represent the years in which the 
facts occurred, e.g. 
“ ‘The Saxon is doomed, a Duke England obtains 
And the second William ascendancy gains, 
Tyrrel's arrow attacks and the Sage acquires sway, 
Then Adela’s offspring the men long obey.” 
In this doggerel the initial consopants in each line give respec- 
tively the dates 1066, 1087, 1100, and 1185. You will observe 
the extreme difficulty which hampers the poet in the construc-

tion of Tines like these; and that after all the result is not only 
alinost unintelligible, but even the names of the two monarchs 
Henry and Stephen referred to in the latter lines are not given. 
It would be easy to multiply examples of these systems of 
artifiial memory, but to me they all seem open to one fatal ob- 
ection.” We are establishing with the names of historical per- 
‘Sobages a number of associations, some absurd, some unmean- 
ing aad all false, and burdening the memory of children with 
something in itself contessedly useless, for the sake of some- 
thing‘useful supposed to be cmbodied in it. We assume that 
the mechanical contrivance will keep the date in the mind, and 
that afterwards the date will remain fixed, and the mere me- 
chanism drop out of sight altogether. Now experience shows 
‘that the opposite result happens. Persons who have been 
taught on these mnemonic systems have often told me in later 
life that they have remembered the doggerel verses, or the queer 
ayllables, but have forgotten the key. So the end has not been 
attained after all, On the whole therefore I have little faith in 
any device for remembering dates, except becoming interested 
in the events to which the dates relate. 
An obvious inference from the view of historical study here 
Presented is, that Biography is too much neglected, -

garded among schooimasters. Yet every one knows how much 
more attractive is the life of a person than the history of mere 
events, There is a sympathy and a human interest awakened, 
when the career of a man is discussed, which can never be ex- 
cited in any other way. The great charm of the Bible history, 
a8 we have seen, lies in the fact that it is a series of biographies, 
held together by a thread of narrative, it is true, but deriving 
‘its main interest from the circumstance that we see human 
fortunes in progress, human passions at work, and real human 
ebaracters, whom we can love, or criticise, or admire. Our 
knowledge of the Bible history is primarily a knowledge of 
Moses, or David, or Paul, and only incidentally of the political 
and social condition of the people among whom they lived.

Yet, though incidental only, this knowledge is very real, and 
is none the less valuable because it is held in the mind by its 
association with what we know of the chief personages, and 
their character and career. A good teacher will therefore do 
well occasionally, when his scholars are reading the history 
of a given period, to interrupt the regular course, and to select 
some representative man of the epoch, gather together from all. 
sources particulars respecting him, and give two or three special 
lessons on his life. Suppose, for example, that the fife of 
William of Wykeham is taken to illustrate the reign of Edward. 
Ill. Let the pupils be led bya brief sketch to take an in- 
terest in the man, to follow his fortunes, to estimate his charac- 
ter. Let them sec pictures of the buildings which he erected, 
be reminded of Winchester, of Windsor, of New College, Ox- 
ford, and of Saint Cross, and so get a glimpse of the educa- 
tional machinery, the architecture, and the social habits of the” 
period. Let them be directed to books in the library, in which 
anecdotes and illustrative matter may be found. Let them in- 
vestigate the public and political questions with which his life 
was associated, and then be desired to prepare a sketch as full 
as possible, and in a narrative form, embodying all they have 
learned about Wykeham. 
The result of such an exercise will be found to justify the in- 
terruption of the ordinary historical lessons for one or two 
weeks, A pupil who, in this way, has been directed succes- 
sively to the biography of Alfred, of A’Becket, of Chaucer, of 
the Earl of Warwick, of Cecil, of Bacon, of Cromwell, and of 
Pitt cannot fail to have an extensive acquaintance with the cur- 
rent history of the times in which these men lived; while the 
form in which that knowledge is acquired will be found better 
adapted than any other to retain a permanent hold on his mind. In the selection of the typical man of each age, the teacher will " be guided, partly by his own tastes, and partly by the materials at his command and the books to which he has access, It is - Of more importance that he should choose some one man in whom he is himself interested, and whose biography be has

that he should be guided by any selection which another could 
make for him. 
Tho materials for such biographical lessons are very abund- 
ant in our language, and may be found with little 
trouble. Our language is rich in admirable mono- of states in 
graphs, such as Bacon’s Henry VII., Lucy Hutch- blography.

Earl Russell’s Life of his ancestor Lord Russell, Fox’s James

quisite book of Lives, in Fuller's Worthies, in Macaulay’s 
Biographies, in Lord Brougham’s Statesmen of the Time of 
George TII., in Miss Strickland’s Lives of the Queens, and in 
Mignet’s Mary Queen of Scots, also, abundant material for 
Pleasing and graphic pictures of life and manners may be 
found. Very often, too, a diligent teacher will find that by 
piecing together the facts stated in two or three different books 
about some one person, he will be able, without difficulty, to 
Prepare a short lecture or oral lesson, the preparation and ar- 
Yatgement of which will be as useful to himself as it will 
prove beneficial to his pupils. If this practice be occasionally 
adopted, it will surprise him to find how the facts relating to 
the history of an age will cluster and organize themselves 
round a great man’s name, and how systematic the knowledge 
of history will thus become. I have already referred to the 
use-of a library for these purposes, and to the way in which 
“after the teacher has given a brief sketch of the life he may set 
his pupils to fill up that sketch in writing, with all the particu- 
lars they can glean from different sources, until they have, in 
fact, partly produced the biography themselves. He will after- 
wards require the information thus given to be reproduced by”

logically, or tabulated under various heads, pesides an estimate 
of the character of the person whose life has been selected.

lyle, Freeman, Miss Martineau, Guizot, or Mr. of rical 
Knight, which are characterized by special inter- 
est or pictorial beauty, and which, if read to a class that had 
been recently engaged in accumulating the dry details of a 
given period, would be sure to help the imagination, and stimu- 
late the intellectual activity and strengthen the memory of the 
pupils. A teacher's own taste will generally be a safer guide 
in the adaptation of his readings to his ordinary teaching than 
any formal list which could be set down here. But in making 
his selection he need on no account confine himself to grave 
books of history; one of the Paston Letters, a naif anecdote 
from Froissart, a gossiping letter of Horace Walpole, a paper 
from the Spectator, an extract from Evelyn’s Diary, a chapter 
of De Foe’s History of the Plague, or even a passage from one 
of honest Pepys’ grotesque confessions, will, if wisely chosen, 
and read at the right time, be fqund to play an important part 
in fastening the record of some great event on the mind. Nor 
should the stores of our poetical and dramatic literature be 
overlooked. What a freshness and life will be given to the 
dry bones of an ordinary narrative of the Wars of the Roses, if 
the teacher treats the learners at the end of their task with two 
or three well-selected scenes from Shakespeare’s Henry IV. or 
VI. Who would not understand the whole life, costume, oc- 
cupation, and morale of Edward III.’s contemporaries all the 
better for hearing Chaucer’s inimitable description of some of 
the Canterbury Pilgrims, or even a page of Sir John Mande- 
ville’s quaint book of Travels? I cannot expect a mere routine 
teacher to take all the trouble I am recommending, but to all 
who desire to give to English history that place in their pupils’ 
affection and interest which it deserves, I would say, Make 
your own miscellaneous reading tell upon your school lessons. 
This is a good rule in relation to all subjects. Attention to it

serves to widen the range of illustration at command, and to 
impart vivacity and force to all the teaching of a school. But 
in history the rule is especially applicable. Let a teacher read 
one or two of Wordsworth’s sonnets about the introduction of 
Christianity into England after his class has learned the story 
of Augustine’s mission; or Macaulay’s poem on the Spanish 
Armada, when that subject has been studied; or a pungent 
passage from Dryden’s Absalom and Achitophel, or Milton’s 
sonnet on Cromwell, or a ballad from Percy’s Reliques, and the 
advantage of the practice will soon become apparent to him. 
Within the range of such reading also may fairly be included 
good extracts from Ivanhoe or Waverley, from the Last of the 
Barons, from Westward Ho, or Henry Esmond. It may be 
said, perhaps, that all this is not history; that children come to 
school to learn facts, not fictions, and that there is danger of 
relaxing the bonds of intellectual discipline by introducing into 
the school-room material of so unscholastic a character as a 
play of Shakespeare, or a novel of Sir Walter Scott. But to 
this it may be easily replied that my recommendation only ex- 
tends to the contrivances by. which school-book work of the 
ordinary kind is to be supplemented, not to any device for 
superseding it. We are not to use the imagination as an alter- 
native, but as a help to the memory. 
Nevertheless, there is one sense in which poetry embodies 
The poetry as much historical truth as history itself. We of ry: ought to know, not only what can actually be verified as fact but what has been believed to be fact. That Romulus and Remus were suckled by a wolf, that Agamem- non sailed ‘against Troy, that Numa was instructed in the art of kingship by the divine Egeria, that Arthur gathered a goodly fellowship of famous knights at the Round Table at Caerleon, that William Tell shot at the apple on his son’s head, may, or may ‘not, be authentic facts which will stand the test of historic criticism, But they were for ages be- lieved to be facts. The belief in their truth helped to shape the character and the convictions of after-ages, They had there

  : History in Poetry. 361 
eee 
fore all the force of truths, and they deserve study just as much 
_ a8 facts which can be historically verified. From this point of 
view Sophocles is as true and profound as Thucydides; Shake- 
Speare as true as Bacon, and Chaucer as Froissart. Schiller in 
his Wallenstein is as much a historian as in his Thirty Years 
War. Thackeray when he wrote Hsmond, after taking pains 
to saturate his own mind with the literature, the manners, and 
the history of the eighteenth century, was as true a historian as 
when he prepared his more matter-of-fact critical estimates of 
the lives of Addison and Steele and their contemporaries, 
When Ben Jonson wrote Catiline and Sejanus, or Shakespeare 
Julius: Casar and King John, they were historians in even & 
truer sense than if they had sought without the aid of the vivi- 
fying imagination to give a bare narrative of such facts as 
could stand the test of destructive criticism. Considered as a 
picture of real life, is not Sir Walter Scott’s Marmion or Ivan- 
hoe as true a thing as his History of Napoleon? When the 
author wrote the last. as mere task-work for the booksellers, he 
very conscientiously consulted his authorities, and sought to 
produce an orderly and connected narrative. But when he 
wrote Ivanhoe he studied the manners and incidents of the age, 
and sought to penetrate his own fancy with a picture of its 
doings, and habits, and modes of thinking. We will not stop 
toinquire which is the more interesting production: that is a 
question which has long been settled. But which, for all prac- 
tical purposes, is the truer book, and the more important con- 
tribution to our history? Surely there is a higher truth than 
the truth of mere detail, and that is just what the compiler of 
annals misses, and the man of poetic genius seizes and retains. 
The power 
«To show the very age and body of the time”* 
isa rare one; it requires not only knowledge of actual occur- 
Tences, but philosophic insight enough to distinguish between 
characteristic and exceptional events, and imagination enough 
to select and adapt the materials, and to give unity and veri-
-P-A-G-E-353
352 History. 
    
similitude to the whole picture. And it is surely as im- 
portant to us, and as helpful to the studies of our pupils, to 
know what impression the history of an age has conveyed toa 
man of genius, as to know what facts a laborious compiler may 
have collected about it.! Do not let us, then, despise the help 
which poets and even novelists can afford us in history. They 
appeal, in a way in which no mere historian can, to the im- 
agination of children, and to that love of pictures and of 
dramatic incident, which is so strong in early youth. If judi- 
ciously and occasionally used, they make the story of the past 
a more real, living thing, and they may do much to increase 
the interest and pleasure which is felt by pupils in historical 
study. 
And so it will be seen that of the two modes of teaching his- 
Dangers of tory, that which relies mainly on the dry bones of & 
relying on text-book and that which secks to clothe these 
sechig? hones with flesh and blood, and give to them vivid 
only. and picturesque reality, I greatly prefer the second. 
But we must not be insensible to the faults of this method if it 
is pursued alone. It may easily become loose and desultory, it 
is apt simply to awaken interest and animation, without taking 
- means to secure that this interest serves a real educational pur- 
pose. We have before shown that picturesque teaching some- 
times leads the pupil to mistake interesting general impressions 
for real knowledge; and worst of all, that it encourages him to 
  
1 On this point Archdeacon Hare has a pregnant remark: ‘The poet 
may choose such characters, and may bring them forward in such situa- 
‘tions as shall be typical of the truths which he wishes to embody, 
whereas the historian is tied down to particular actions, most of them 
performed officially, and rarely such as display much of character 
unless in moments of exaggerated vehemence. Indeed many histories 
give you little else than a narrative of military affairs, marches, and 
counter-marches, skirmishes, and battles, which, except during some 
great crisis of a truly national war, afford about as complete a picture 
of a nation’s life as an account of the doses of physic a man may have 
taken, and the surgical operations he may have undergone, would be of 
the life of an individual.”
-P-A-G-E-354
Dangers of Merely Picturesque Teaching. 353 
  
indulge in sweeping historical generalization without knowing 
accurately the data on which it is founded. All this should be 
known and guarded against. It can only be effectually pre- 
vented by localizing each fact as it is learned in your Time- 
map, and by building up a fabric of dates, names, Acts of Par- 
liament and other details, which will sustain and justify the 
historical impressions you wish to convey. 
Keeping this in view, you may be well content to set before 
yourself, as the main object in teaching History, the kindling 
of a strong interest in the subject, rather than the covering of a 
large area of mere information. ‘For if you do the second and 
not the first, your pupil will not be likely to pursue the subject 
for himself. But if you do the first and not the second, all the 
Test may be safely left to his own discretion and reading. His- 
tory, we may observe, is the one subject of school instruction in 
which your* pupil can do best without your aid, and which 
when you have once kindled an appetite for it, you may most 
safely drop out of your regular course, and leave to take care 
of itself. 
Lastly, I would urge upon you the importance of lessons on 
the government and constitution under which we yessons on 
live. It is absurd to find children knowing about the Aa 
the Heptarchy and the Feudal System, and yet constitution 
not knowing how our present Parliament is con- England, 
stituted, and what are its duties and functions. Not unfre- 
quently I find in examining candidates for the public service 
students who really possess a good deal of book-knowledge 
about the Constitutions of Clarendon and the Act of Settlement, 
showing lamentable ignorance as to the way in which laws are 
made at this moment; telling me, e.g., that all Acts of Parlia- 
ment originate with the Commons and must go to the Upper 
House for sanction. 
In giving a series of special lessons on our laws and con- 
stitution you will not be content with Hallam and Creasy and 
the constitutionalists who seem to think that the whole of the 
History of England resolves itself into a struggle between 
23

  Crown and people, and into the gradual assertion of the right 
Leesonaon' Of representation, and of what Carlyle cynically de- 
the duties as acribes as the liberty to tax one’s sclf. That indeed 
of isa very important part of English History, but 
sip. it is not the whole. ‘The removal of the im- 
pediments to printing and to the diffusion of knowledge; the 
history of Slavery and of its abolition; the gradual disappear- 
ance of religious disabilities, economic and commercial reform, 
the imposition and working of the Poor Law; the provision for 
National Education in the form of ancient endowments, and 
afterwards by public grants; the reform of the representation; 
the growth of literature, the extension of our Colonies—all 
these subjects deserve to be looked at separately, and to furnish 
the material for special lessons in the lecture form, Indeed I 
am disposed to recommend that concurrently with the study of 
history by periods, you should arrange a series of lessons, ac- 
cording to subjects, on this wise: 
‘The Crown and its prerogatives. ‘Taxes. 
‘The House of Lords. A general election. 
‘The House of Commons. ‘Treason. 
‘The history and progress of an Act. The Army. of Parliament. ‘The Navy. 
‘Ministers. The Civil Service. 
Judges. Public Trusts. 
Magistrates, +The administration of towns and 
Municipal Corporations, parishes. Juries. Guardians of the poor. 
, Such a course, carefully prepared, and well illustrated by historical examples, will have the incidental effect of making 
the scholars sensible of the responsibility which will hereafter devolve upon them as members of a free community; a state which asks the voluntary services of her citizens in the admin- 
istration of justice, in the management of public trusts, and in the conduct of public business, Every boy should be made to feel that unbought services will be required of him as member 
of parliament, magistrate, guardian or trustee, and that it will

be honorable to render them. This sense of civic duty seems 
to me the necessary correlative to that consciousness of civic 
tights which Hallam and the constitutional writers are apt to 
dwell on so exclusively. “You will find materials for such les. _ 
sons not only in Hallam and Creasy, but also in Bagehot and 
in Sir Erskine May. 
, Nor ought we to overlook the necessity for so teaching as to 
inspire our scholars with a love and admiration 
for the country we live in and for the institutions 
by which we are governed. It used to be the fashion tmauch 
more than now, for Englishmen, especially after dinner, to talk 
wauch of our glorious and unrivalled constitution in Church 
and State. No doubt there was in all this an element of insular 
Doastfulness, and perhaps a little selfishness and vulgarity. 
But after all patriotism is one of the things which our teaching 
ought to cultivate—a rational and affectionate regard for the 
country in which we have been born, and for the privileges we 
enjoy in it: Patriotism. 
“ It is the land that freemen till, 
‘That sober suited Freedom chose, 
‘The land where, girt with friends or foes, 
Aman may speak the thing he will. 
Aland of settled government, 
A land of just and old renown, 
Where freedom broadens slowly down 
From precedent to precedent. 
‘Where faction seldom gathers head, 
But by degrees to fulness wrought 
. ‘The strength of some diffusive thought 
Hath time and space to work and spread.” 
And in every English school something at least should be 
done to make the scholars proud of this glorious heritage, and 
to animate them with a noble ambition to live lives and to do 
deeds which shall be worthy of it.

advantage consider the reasons for including such studies in 
our school-course, aud the place they ought to hold in it, for it 
is, after all, out of such considerations that all discovery of 
right methods ought to arise. The skilled teacher must look 
at the whole of the large domain of the inductive sciences, 
those which depend on observation and experiment, and ask 
himself how they are related to his special work. Until re- 
cently studies of this kind were rarely or never recognized as 
necessary parts of a liberal education. Even now they are 
fighting the way to recognition by slow degfees and against 
some opposition, The staple of school and university instruc- 
tion down to our own time has consisted of the study of lan- 
guage and that of pure science, including mathematics and 
logic. On the part of the great majority of educated men in 
England, whose own minds had been formed in this way, there 
has been a strong feeling that all true intellectual training was 
to be had in connection with these time-honored studies. It is 
true that new and most fertile fields of investigation have been 
discovered and explored. Geology has brought to light mar- 
Vellous facts respecting the history of our earth, electricity and 
Yoagnetism have been applied in unexpected ways to the com- 
fort and convenience of man, biologists have investigated the 
conditions and resources of life, astronomers have discovered 
by spectrum analysis the nature and even the chemical compo-

sition of the heavenly bodies; the chemist, the physicist, the 
botanist, have each in his turn revealed to us some hidden 
foreés'iy nature, and taught us how those forces may be made 
available in enriching, beautifying, and ennobling the life of 
man on the earth. 
Tt must be owned however that these researches have owed 
little to the direct influence of our schools and i,o triumphs 
colleges, It is not by academically trained men, of sciences 
asarule, that the great physical discoveries have not largely 
been made. Those who have made these dis- et university 
coveries have broken away, so to speak, from the ” 
traditional life of a student and a scholar; have quitted the 
study of books and betaken themselves to the study of things. 
They have come face to face with the realities of life, have 
seen and handled the materials of which the visible world was 
composed, and thus have in time formulated an entirely new 
body of knowledge, very different in kind from that which is 
to be found in the books which are called Jearned. And hence 
there has been for a time an apparent antagonism between the 
men of learning and the great discoverers, inventors, and ex- 
perimenters in the world of physical science. Centuries ago 
Socrates taught that the only studies which were of real value 
to man were those which related to his own nature and destiny, 
to his duty as a member of a family or a state, to the culture of 
his own faculties, and to the relation in which he stood to the 
gods and to his fellow-men. As to investigations into the order 
of the heavens or into the nature of physical laws, he thought 
them presumptuous and sterile. The gods, he thought, had 
purposely concealed such knowledge from men, while in regard 
to the means whereby the material comfort of man might be 
increased he would certainly have dismissed such considera- 
tions as mean and ignoble, fit only for a tradesman or mechanic, 
but unworthy of a philosopher. 
- Some such feeling has survived among Jearned men, even 
down to our own time. You may find it in such utterances as 
“The proper study of mankind is man.” It is shown in the
-P-A-G-E-359
358 Natural Science, 
  
greater importance assigned to metaphysics and philology, to 
logic, to mental, moral, and theological speculation, and to 
pure or deductive science, in all systems of academic instruc- 
tion; and in the distrust felt by many, even down to our own 
time, of experimental science as something material, loose, and 
just a little commercial and vulgar. 
In all the recent investigations into the condition of the great 
Position of | @Fammar Schools nothing was more striking than 
natural, the position of complete inferiority occupied by 
science. the study of the physical sciences, even in the rare 
cases in which they were recognized and admitted into the 
curriculum. The head-master was gencrally what is called a 
classical man, and naturally regarded success in his own de- 
partment as the best test of a boy’s possession of a gentleman’s 
education. The teacher of physical science was only an occa- 
sional lecturer, poorly paid and little considered, and boys who 
devoted much time to that branch of study were understood to 
have lost caste in some way, and to fall short of the best ideal 
which the school sought to set up for its scholars. Nor can it 
be wondered at, that cultivated men felt a little reluctance to 
admit the physical sciences to honorable recognition as an in- 
tegral part of the school course, For much of what called 
itself science was essentially unscientific in its character and in 
its methods of investigation. The teachers were often mere 
specialists, entirely deficient in that general cultivation which 
alone enables a man to see his own subject in true perspective 
and proportion, and to'teach that subject in the most effective 
way. A series of lectures illustrated by an orrery, on the 
“sublime science of Astronomy” in ladies’ schools, or a few 
amusing experiments in chemistry in boys’ schools, have often 
represented the teaching of science, and have been regarded 
very justly by head-masters and mistresses with a little con- tempt. “May I ask you,” said Lord ‘Taunton, as chairman of 
the Schools Inquiry Commission, to a schoolmaster who in his evidence was giving rather unusual testimony to the interest bis boys took in physical science, “what department of science

  mS Tis Intellectual Claims. 359 
  
  interests the scholars most?” “I think,” was the reply,” it is 
the chemistry of the explosive substances.” Of course, a bright 
light and a noise are amusing to schoolboys, but their interest 
in such phenomena is no very strong proof that they are learn- 
ing science in any sense, or for any really valuable purpose. 
And all this time there has been an increasing number of 
thinkers and students, who, while not destitute of Modern 
that general intellectual training which is to be PO™E 2S {5 
got in the old beaten track of classics and mathe- this subject. 
matics, have gone out into the wide domain of physical research 
and found it more fruitful than they expected. And they say 
to those who live in the academic world—the world of books 
and of scholarly traditions, “‘ You are mistaken in supposing 
that this is a merely material and practical region, while yoursis 
essentially intellectual. There is here a body of truth, of the 
highest practical utility no doubt, but also of the greatest value 
for educational purposes. The laws and principles by which 
the facts of the material world may be explained and co-ordi-. 
nated are quite as uniform, quite as beautiful, and as far-reach- 
ing in their applications as any of the Jaws of language or the 
truths of mathematics. Moreover, the processes of thought re- 
quired in the study of these questions are just as rigorous, just 
a8 stimulating, stand in just as close a relation to the intellec- 
tual needs of a well-instructed man as those involved in tHe 
older studies. You can make the teaching of physical science 
as fruitful, as thoroughly disciplinal for all the higher purposes 
contemplated in a liberal education as the teaching of Greek or 
of geometry if you will only first recognize the possibility of 
making it so, if you will encourage skilled and accomplished 
men to take up this branch of instruction, and are ready to 
give them the same sfatus and encouragement which you now 
give to accomplished teachers of philology or history. Enlarge 
your conception of what a liberal education means. Let that 
conception include some acquaintance with the actual constitu- 
tion of the world we live in, of the forces which surround us, 
of the framework of our own bodies and the laws of matter
-P-A-G-E-361
360 Natural Science. 
and of life, and make provision for these things, as well as for those facts and speculations which are to be found only in books, and which have hitherto usurped the name of scholar- ship.” 
There is surely great force in this appeal, and no one of us Reasons for Who has any power of controlling the education these ' of the young can Properly disregard it. We may wish, for our own parts, that some Huxley or Tyndall had enunciated this message before we ourselves went to school, for then we might discuss with greater advantage the true claims of physical science and the place it should hold in a school course. But of the legitimacy of those claims there can be no doubt, and it may be well for us to try to analyze them. For, consider in the first place the immense practical useful- QQ) The hess of some knowledge of physical science and phuities of the number of unexpected applications to the use truths, and service of man which are found to grow out, not only of every new discovery, but of every honest effort to submit ‘old discoveries to the test of new observation and ex- periment. One man studies carefully the nature of light, tries experiments with Tefracting media, with teflecting instruments, Separates the Tays, ascertains the chemical effect of certain rays on-certain substances. He does all this perhaps from mere in- terest in the discovery of new and beautiful truth, and has no suspicion that Speculative experiments of this kind can serve any immediate practical purpose. But soon it appears that 
is beautiful, to Tepresent to us a beloved countenance, to register the phenomena of nature, and even to aid in the detection of crime. It would not be difficult to show that almost every new and valuable invention from the spinning-jenny to the telephone, which has increased the control of man over nature, economized his time or added to his'coi onor mfort, is the product of scientific knowledge, and often of experiments and researches

eee 
which had at first no merely utilitarian purpose, but were 
undertaken with the sole and simple object of discovering the 
secrets of nature, and revealing truth. And there is not a single 
lesson by means of which you can convey toa child a strong 
interest in any one department of physical science which may 
not develop itself, as it works and germinates in his mind, into 
results and discoveries of unexpected value, and add enormously 
to the resources and to the enjoyments of mankind. 
A-second reason for giving to a learner some acquaintance 
with nature and with the laws which govern her () their 
phenomena is the extreme beauty of the truths beauty and 
themselves, Even if nothing useful were to be attractive- 
gained by the study of science, it would be a ™™* 
shame to pass our lives in this well-ordered and harmonious 
world, and catch no echoes of the music of its laws; to’ be sur- 
rounded every day by mysteries, none of which we ever tried | 
to penetrate; to possess a body fearfully and wonderfully made, 
and to cast no thoughts on its structure, its physiology, the 
functions of its parts, the marvellous adaptation of means to 
ends; to find one’s self conveyed 60 miles an hour through the 
agency of steam, and one’s thoughts conveyed a thousand times 
faster by the agency of electricity; and yet to know nothing of 
the nature of these forces or the laws of their action; to walk 
amid flowers and rocks, glaciers and avalanches, and to remain 
uninstracted and untouched by them. But it is mainly by the 
conscious and systematic study of natural science that we learn 
to notice all these things and to draw right inferences from 
them. It must be knowledge of nature after all that is at the 
basis of a true enjoyment of her works, and a true: reverence 
for her Author. . 
“Is it not,” says Herbert Spencer, “an absurd and almost a sacrilegi- 
ovg belief that the more a man studies Nature, the less he reveres it? 
Think you that a drop of water, which to the vulgar eye is merely a 
drop of water, loses anything in the eye of the physicist who knows that

  ooked upon by the uninitiated as a mere snow-flake does not suggest 
xigher associations to one who has seen through a microscope the won- 
irously-varied and elegant forms of snow-crystals? Think you that the 
rounded rock marked with parallel scratches calls up as much poetry 
in an ignorant mind as in the mind of a geologist who knows that over 
this rock a glacier slid a million of years ago? The truth is, that those 
who have never entered on scientific pursuits are blind to most of the 
poetry by which they are surrounded. Whoever has not in youth col- 
lected plants and insects, knows not half the halo of interest which lanes 
and hedge-rows can assume. Whoever has not sought for fossils, has 
little idea of the poetical associations that surround the places where 
imbedded treasures were found. Whoever at the seaside has not had a 
microscope and aquarium, has yet to learn what the highest pleasures: 
of the seaside are.” ~ 
But after all, the main reason for teaching some branch of 
@) The dis- physical science is to be found in considering the 
ciplinal value sort of processes by which the truths of such 
tive process. science are investigated, and the faculties of mind 
which are exercised in the course of physical investigations. 
For in the first place a student of any branch of natural history 
or science must learn to observe carefully, to use his eyes and 
to know the difference between facts which are abnormal and 
facts which are typical. Then he must come into actual con- 
tact with realities, must handle objects, must try experiments, 
must question matter and nature closely, must wait and watch, 
must invent new forms of test until he is quite sure that he has 
hold of the true answer. And when he has observed the 
phenomena, he has to reason from them inductively, and pass 
from particular facts to the general laws which underlie and 
comprehend them. We saw in considering the subject of 
mathematics that certain axioms and data being postulated the 
reasoner proceeded deductively, and out of them unfolded in 
due sequence an orderly series of particular truths. We saw 
that mathematics efforded a discipline in pure logic in passing 
from premise to conclusion, in detecting fallacies in reasoning,’ 
and generally in deducing special inferences from wide, com- 
prehensive, and admitted truths. But in the physical sciences 
the mind proceeds in exactly the opposite direction. You

Process of Inductive Reasoning. 363 
  begin with the particulars, you combine and co-ordinate them, 
and at last, when you have enough of them, you arrive at some 
general proposition which includes them all. This generalized 
‘truth, which is the starting-point in mathematics, is the goal in 
physics; and whereas researches in the physical sciences tell 
you how to get at your major premise, or your universal truth, 
it is the business of mathematics and of logic to tell you what 
inferences you may deduce from such a truth when you have 
got it. So all investigations into the phenomena of nature 
must begin by the observation of facts. The observer must 
put his facts together, must group them according to their re- 
semblances and differences, and see what they have to say for 
themselves, He must have no prepossessions, no wish to twist ° 
the facts into a particular direction. His theory or finai gene- 
ralization when it comes must have been actually suggested by 
the facts. 
This kind of procedure is very different from that by which 
the mind acts in syllogistic reasoning; and it is not mauctive 
wonderful that in the middle ages, when people Teasoning. 
began to study the nature of matter and of force, they shoula 
have imagined that all truth about these things was to be ob- 
tained in the same way as the truths about geometry, by the 
methods of Aristotelian logic. Hence, even the early physicists 
hampered themselves with certain dogmas, or first principles, 
which seemed to them self-evident, that ‘nothing can act 
where it is not,” that “nature abhorred a vacuum,” that there 
‘was somewhere in the world a substance which would trans- 
mute all metals into gold, that some source of perpetual motion 
could be discovered, or that ‘‘out of nothing nothing can 
come.” It was against this kind of assumption that Bacon 
protested. Hypotheses non jingo—I fashion no hypotheses, he 
said. “‘ Man is the minister and interpreter of nature.” It is 
his business to find out what she actually says and does, and 
when he has thus acquired data and facts cnough be may 
construct upon them a theory that shall fit the facts, but not 
before.

  A well-known line of a Roman poet expresses the desire of 
The search Mankind to know the causes of things, ‘Felix qu 
for causes, —_potuit rerum cognoscere causas.” You naturally 
wish to know causes; but it may be that nature will not reveal 
causes to you at all—but only facts. I take up something in 
my hand. What happens when I take it up? One set of 
muscles contracts and allows my fingers to stretch and to open; 
another set of muscles contracts as I grasp the object. Why 
do these muscles contract? Because they were affected by 
nerves. How came the nerves to convey the impulse? The 
impulse was given from the brain with which the nerve is con- 
nected. How did this impulse originate? In a wish that I 
formed. Do all the motions of the body originate in acts of 
consciousness or in acts of will? No, for some muscles, those 
of the heart, and digestive apparatus, for example, alternately 
expand and contract with great regularity without any volition 
of ours, indeed we could not by an act of will keep up these 
motions if they stopped, or stop them when they were going 
on. Are these automatic motions then produced by nervous 
impulse? Yes. But whence then does the impulse originate? 
Not in this case from the brain, but from other nervous centres 
or ganglia situated in the spinal cord. Is it then so, that move- 
tents which are conscious, and are produced or controlled by 
the will, come from nerves which communicate with the brain, 
and that automatic. and unconscious muscular movements 
originate in other and inferior centres of nervous action? Yes. 
Observe in all this, I have been seeking to know the cause. 
But Iam no nearer knowing the cause at the end than at the 
beginning. Why and how a thought or wish of mine which 
seems wholly spiritual and mental should produce the physical 
result of setting a particular nerve in tremulous motion, and 
why that motion should in turn cause a muscle to contract, is 
98 great a mystery to me as ever The only answers to my 
questions have been statements of fact. Jf 7s 0. Such a cir.

particular antecedent to be followed by the particular conse- 
quent, I know nothing. 
Take another example. I let this pen drop out of my hand. 
Why does it fall? Because I did not prevent it. and for 
But why should it move in that particular direction, Teasons. 
when I gave it no impulse but merely ceased to hold it? Because 
all objects when disengaged tend to fall to the earth. But why 
should bodies fall towards the earth? Because the earth is a 
very large mass of matter, and smaller bodies are always at- 
tracted to large ones, But why and how do large bodies be- 
come thus attractive? Well, it is observed that throughout 
nature all masses of matter exercise mutual attraction and that 
the extent of this attraction is determined partly by their mass 
or density, and partly by their distances from each other. Is 
this true of the planets and of the Sun? Yes. There is one 
broad statement which Kepler formulated in reference to this 
great fact of gravitation, It may be expressed thus, Gravity = 
Mass +- The Distance squared, and is often called the law of 
gravitation. . 
Now you will notice here again that at each step I have asked 
the question Why? and that at no step have I re- wot causes 
ceived an answer. The answer I have obtained in por reasons, 
each case is the statement of a fact only; but then . 
each fact was one broader, more comprehensive and general than 
that which preceded it. The first fact was single; it was within 
the range of a little child’s experience—that the pen fell. The last 
statement of fact, the great truth of gravitation, was far-redch- 
ing, sublime, co-extensive with the whole range of the universe 
/86 far as man can know anything about it all—a statement of 
fact which includes in its generalization the explanation—so we 
call it—of the movements of the atmosphere, of the rising and 
falling of the tides, and of the march of the planets ‘on their 
heavenly way. But as a matter of fact, nothing has been ex- 
plained or accounted for, no mystery has been solved. Each 
single fact derived from observation has been referred to some

between the act or event which is exceptional and that which is 
typical? Do we not feel that what are wanted here are temper, 
reserve, breadth of mind, observation wide enough to compre- 
hend a great many special details before arriving at large gene- 
ral assertions? And these are precisely the qualities of mind 
which the study of physical science generates and encourages. 
They are not brought into special activity either by the study 
of language or by the study of mathematics, valuable as both of 
them are in their place. For the logic of pure synthesis may 
show you how to detect fallacies in drawing conclusions from 
general truths; it is by the inductive process that men must 
form the fixed and general principles on which they reason and 
act. And since for once that a man goes wrong through rea- 
soning badly on given data, he goes wrong ten times through 
accepting data which are unsound and unverified; inductive 
reasoning is at least as useful a part of mental training for the 
duty of life, as the deductive process to which the name logic 
was once exclusively applied. 
Such are some of the weightiest reasons for desiring to see 
experimental and inductive science included in every scheme 
of liberal education. Other reasons might easily be multiplied. 
“‘ Scientific teaching,” say the Public School Commissioners in 
their Report of 1861, “‘is perhaps the best corrective for that 
indolence which is the vice of half-awakened minds, and which 
shrinks from any exertion that is not like an effort of memory, 
purely mechanical.” A still more practical and obvious reason 
was urged in the Report of the Parliamentary Committee of 
18638, ‘‘ A knowledge of the principles of science would tend to 
Promote industrial progress by stimulating improvement, by 
preventing costly and unphilosophical attempts at impossible 
inventions, diminishing waste, and obviating in a great measure 
ignorant opposition to salutary changes.” 
Practical and commercial considerations like these must of 
course not be kept out of view. They have a very intimate 
bearing on the education of primary schools and on the wel- 
fare of the industrial classes generally. One hears of the

want of knowledge often evinced by artisans; of the trade 
rules which practically forbid a man to put ye 
special ability or enthusiasm into his work, pi sctensifie 
and which seem designed to reduce the working on x 
power of the intelligent mechanic to the level of *#4e 
that. of the unintelligent. Laments are often heard of the 
decay of the old custom of apprenticeship, by which a master 
undertook to give a youth systematic instruction in the art and 
mystery which he practised; and in consequence of these short- 
comings it is said that English workmen are less successful 
competitors than they once were with the skilled craftsmen of 
other nations, The gravity of these facts is unquestionable, 
though it is not within our present province to discuss them, 
exeept in their bearing on school education. Closely connected 
with every form of handicraft there is some kind of elementary 
science—it may be of mechanics, or of chemistry, of the prop- 
erties of matter, or the nature of forces—which explains and 
justifies the rules of that particular handicraft and the knowl- 
edge of these things would be useful to the workman, not only 
in enabling him to do his work better, but also in calling out 
his sympathy and transforming him from a mechanical drudge 
into an intelligent worker, It is a humiliating thing to seea 
grown man content to employ year after year methods and 
. forces which he does not care to understand. No one who 
ears his living under such conditions can get any enjoyment 
out of his work. Still less is he capable of discovering new 
methods by which in his own special department future work- 
ers may be helped to economize time, and to do work in a more 
artistic and thorough manner. 
A partial remedy for this evil would be found if the study of 
natural phenomena were included in some form in the course 
of every primary school. One at least of the specific subjects 
of advanced instruction for which in the higher classes the Edu- 
cation Department makes special grants, should always be at- 
tempted in those classes. That subject should be chosen rather 
Deeause the means exist for teaching it well, than because of its

supposed relation to the particular calling likely to be followed 
by the scholar. Any one branch of physical science will serve 
to stimulate the appetite for further knowledge, and to suggest 
right methods of investigation in other and more practical direc- 
tions, But when the one branch has been chosen, care should 
be taken that it shall not be treated as a new and special ac- 
complishment—a purpureus pannus attached by way of orna- 
ment at the end of the school-studies, but rather as an organic 
part of those studies, in preparation for which a well-arranged. 
series of fact-lessons shall have been regularly given in the lower 
classes. The results of introducing children in the last year of 
their schoollife to the study of entirely new subjects and to 
Jittle text-books full of technical terms, have proved to be very 
unsatisfactory. 
But the further measures towards the true preparation for the 
Technical Calling of a skilled workman lie outside the ordi- 
or Trade nary domain of school life. It is in special techni- 
. cal schools that the craftsman should be helped to 
study the philosophy of his own trade. Such schools under the 
name of “ fcoles d’Apprentis” in France, or of Technical and 
Trade Schools in Switzerland and Germany, have long existed 
and done excellent work. But with the exception of the Trade 
School st Bristol founded by the late Canon Moseley and the 
"Trade School established under the Endowed Schools Act at 
Keighley, very few such institutions have thriven here. Now 
that the old system of apprenticing to masters has died out, the 
pest substitute for it is to be found in the establishment of 
schools which shall be accessible to the scholars who have left 
the prirasry schools, and in which the instruction in manual 
arts, though based on science, shall be consciously directed to 
practical ends. 
"The function of a. Trade or Technical School is rather indus- 
trial than educational. It is to teach science in its application 
to industry and with a special view to the needs of the skilled 
artisan; Its course should include applied mechanics, experi- 
mental physics, clectricity, magnetism and heat, chemistry

  descriptive geometry, the properties of matter, measurement 
of planes and solids, and the principles of construction gener- 
ally. There should be a workshop, a museum of tools and 
implements, a chemical and physical laboratory in which the 
learners can perform experiments under supervision; and the 
classes should be so arranged and divided that the learner may 
obtain an insight into the scientific basis and the practical rules 
of the particular craft which he intends to follow. 
There should be no difficulty in the establichment of such 
Schools in all our great industrial centres; nor even he best

devote a few months to such special studies before entering on 
the business of their lives. Enormous sums have been be- 
queathed in England for the purpose of apprenticing boys to 
trades, They are the survivals from a time when the word 
“apprentice” had a real meaning, and when the provision of 
such funds was one of the wisest forms of benevolence. But 
the conditions of our industrial life are so altered that these large 
funds have ceased to serve their intended purpose, and are too 
often only disguised doles of a very mischievous kind. The 
disposition of such funds which will be most nearly akin to the 
intentions of the original donors is obviously the establishment 
of technical schools and of such bursaries or scholarships as 
may facilitate access to them. . 
Here, however, we revert to the consideration of scientific 
teaching, not for immediate use in trade or COM- gupjects of 
merce, but as a permanent factor in a liberal edu- yaical 
cation. And from this point of view it matters most suited 
very little what branch of such science you select to schools. 
—whether astronomy, mechanics, optics, general physics, 
botany or animal physiology—so long as you keep in view the 
purposes which have to be served in teaching. them, and the 
kind of mental discipline which rightly taught they are able to 
give. You cannot attempt in a school-course to teach all, or

  indeed half of these things, You may well be reconciled to 
this conclusion, when you reflect that to teach any one of them 
well, so as really to kindle the inquisitive and observant spirit, 
and to create a strong interest in watching, recording and co- 
ordinating the facts in some one department of the physical 
world, is to do much to stimulate the desire for further acqui- 
sition of the same kind when your scholar leaves school; and 
to bring into play one set of faculties, which are not sufficiently 
exercised in any other part of your school-course. 
So it will be well to consider in what department of science 
Groundsof you or any one of yourassistants feel the strongest 
. gholce rela interest, or for what kind of teaching you have the 
lute. best material and facilities at hand, and to select 
that. For that is after all the best subject for you to teach. 
And if you are in the country, or dependent on the services of 
visiting teachers, and Mr. A. undertakes to give lectures on 
Astronomy and Mr. B. on Physiology, I would have you de- 
cide between these rivals, not by asking which of the two sub- 
jects is most likely to prove suifable for your scholars, but 
which of the two lecturers is the abler man, the person of 
wider general culture, the more skilful and enthusiastic teacher, 
the one most likely to kindle in your pupil the wish to make 
further researches for himself. 
Nor do I think it at all desirable in selecting a subject of

they may happen to make of the knowledge hereafter in the

or profession to be skilled in practical mechanics i tare and the true reason for teaching such a subject at “ ant = learner aw know something of the properties

way in which knowledge about the facts of the visible world 
ought to be acquired. And all these things have just as close a 
relation to the needs of a woman’s life as to those of a man. 
Again, to a superficial observer, botany seems 85 if it were 
specially a feminine pursuit, There is a very obvious and 
natural association between girls and flowers. It is pleasant to 
think of young maidens in trim gardens culling posies: 
“(The rose had been washed, just washed in a shower, 
Which Mary to Anna conveyed.” 
But such associations do not at all prove that botany is a spe- 
cially appropriate study for young ladies; botany considered as 
a science, the investigation of the parts, the structure and 
functions of plants. There is nothing exclusively feminine in 
it. The truth is that mechanics and botany are both equally 
fitted in the case of either boys or girls to serve the purposes 
which experimental science is meant to serve. All depends 
upon the way in which the subject is taught. 
One very effective eru, or test, by which the difference 
between a good and a bad teacher of such subjects geientific ter- 
is to be detected, is to be found in the use he makes minology. 
of scientific terminology. To hear some teachers of Botany or 
Chemistry you would suppose that to give a thing a hard name 
was to explain a fact, and that the jJearning how to label things 
with technical words was the learning of science. The note- 
books of students are sometimes found to contain little else but 
nomenclature and lists of terms. Such terms are of course in- 
dispensable, but their true value is to fix and crystallize facts 
and distinctions already perceived and explained in the first 
instance without their help. A technical term isa sign of dis- 
tinction and classification, and presupposes that you have 
already something to distinguish and to classify. 
A good teacher first explains the principle of his classification 
or distinction in untechnical phrascology; then shows the need 
of some word or phrase to describe what has been thus seen, 
and then introduces and explains his scientific term. It is only

How and cal phraseology before he is invited to make use

employ it. of science serve its proper and subordinate’ pur- 
pose, and to be a means rather than an end. Thus, as Mr. 
Henry Sidgwick says, ‘‘ The student is taught not ouly how to 
apply a classification ready made, but also to some extent how 
to make a classification; he is taught to deal with a system 
where the classes merge by fine gradations into one another, 
and where the boundaries are often hard tomark; asystem that 
is progressive, and therefore in some points rudimentary, shift- 
ing, liable to continual modification; and along with the im- 
mense value of a carefully framed technical phraseology he is 
also taught the inevitable inadequacy of such a phraseology to 
represent the variety of nature.” ! 
Having chosen your subject you will do well in this depart- 
Practice ag. Ment to rely not wholly on book-work, nor too 
well as book- largely on oral exposition and demonstration, but 
on the actual work of the pupils. They must be 
brought into close contact with the facts and phenomena of 
nature, and must be shown how to handle objects and. investi- 
gate their properties, to make mistakes, and to correct them for 
themselves. It is becoming more generally accepted every day 
by good teachers, not only of Chemistry but of Physics, that 
the best teaching is given in the laboratory rather than in the 
lecture-room. It is not merely by seeing experiments tried, but 
by trying them, that the properties of objects, their structure and 
organization, are best to be learned. But here it must be borne 
in mind that the discipline you want to give must be definite 
aud exact; it is not seeing and handling only, but careful 
HV weasurement if it be mechanics, careful observation if it be 
Botany or Physiology, and whatever it be, careful notes and

Scholars to Make Their Own Illustrations, 375 
  As far as you can, enlist the services of the scholars in the 
manufacture, collection and invention of the Ob- geholars to 
jects used in illustration of experimental lessons. bring and 
Boxes of classified models and specimens which own illustra- 
are prepared by manufacturers, and which are tions. 
often very costly, are far less effective than collections of ob- 
jects which the scholars themselves have helped to form, illus- 
trations of the flora and fauna of the district, its geological 
formation, or manufacturing processes. In two of the best 
grammar schools which I have visited, and in which the great- 
est attention is paid to Natural Science, I found there was a 
carpenter’s shop in which the boys themselves made their own 
apparatus for the illustration of mechanical powers and for 
other departments of science. Within certain limits, of course, 
you want all the help which Prof. Huxley or Balfour Stewart 
or Mr. Lockyer can give you in the form of books, or which. 
the ingenious producer of diagrams, and cabinets of selected 
models and objects, can invent for you. But these things are 
all supplements to true teaching and investigation, not substi- 
tutes for them. ‘ 
After all, no teaching deserves the name of science which is 
a teaching of facts and operations only. In science you must 
have facts, but you must also have ideas. Unless the facts are 
presented in such a way as to group themselves together, throw 
light on one another, and reveal some general law of correlation 
or of sequence in nature, they are not science at all. It is per- 
haps a misfortune that the word ‘‘science” has become popu- 
larly appropriated to a particular kind of information, and that 
astronomy, physics, and a group of like subjects should have 
usurped the name of science. But as I have already reminded 
you, the word ‘‘science” does not refer to a particular class of 
facts, but to the method of investigating them. It does not 
mean knowledge, but knowledge obtained by right principles 
and in a particular way. You may give a lesson ot the future 
tense which shall be in the highest degree scientific, and you
-P-A-G-E-375
376 Natural Science. 
  may give a lesson on the thermometer or on the satellites of 
Jupiter which shall not be science at all. 
We cannot attach much’ educational value to lessons on fa 
Lessonson ‘Miliar objects and occurrences, unless they are 
om given with a distinctly scientific aim, and in a sci- 
pookeattly” entific manner. It is a frequent subject of com- 
plaint that children though learning a great many 
recondite things in school are very ignorant of things out of 
doors, that they do not know, e.g., the difference between wheat 
and barley, or what are the names of common birds and flow- 
ers. Even in a book otherwise so valuable and so pregnant 
with important suggestions as Mr. Herbert Spencer’s book on 
Education you will find a formidable indictment, running in- 
deed throughout all his pages, against schools because they give 
book-learning and grammar and other pedantries, and do not 
show the scholar how to get a living, nor to preserve their 
health, or what will be their future dutics as parents and as 
citizens. 
Such complaints often originate in a certain confusion of 
mind as to what is the proper business of a school. Many 
things are very well worth knowing, which it is not the busi- 
ness of a school to teach. The world is a great school in which 
we are to be learning all our life, and he who brings into it 
quickened faculties will learn its lessons well by actual experi- 
ence. But a child does not come to school to be told that a 
cow has four legs, that fishes swim, or that bread is eatable, 
nutritious, soft, white and opaque. Nor does he come there to 
learn the special business of a farmer, or of an engineer, or of a 
shoemaker, He is there to learn: precisely those things which 
could not be so well learned out of doors, and to gain that sort 
. of capacity and awakening which will enable him to acquire 
readily the leasons of common life and to turn them to the best account. 
If you want to know what is the proper province of the school, consider a little what sort of lives your scholars lead, and the sort of homes they come from. In the houses of the
-P-A-G-E-376

very poor there is probably little talk going on such as would 
draw the attention of children to the most interesting facts of 
nature and of daily life. So in schools for the poor, conversa- 
tional lessons on common things, on birds and beasts, and on 
every-day events, are very uscful and even necessary, If chil- 
dren live in towns and seldom see green fields, occasional les- 
sons on the crops, the aspects of nature and on rural life are 
legitimate parts of a school-course. But if children come from 
orderly and intelligent homes, in which they daily hear sub- 
jects discussed which are worth talking about, and if they 
know something about the country, lessons of this kind are less 
necessary. Bear in mind that anything you can do to make the 
knowledge derived from daily observation more exact and more 
useful, is. Worth doing, because it helps to make the future 
study of science easier. But do not imagine that everything of 
which it isa shame for a child to be ignorant, is necessarily 
your business to teach. The right rule of action appears to me 
to be this. Itis no concern of ours to teach in schools that 
which an observant and intelligent child would learn out of 
doors; but it is our concern go to teach him as to make him ob- 
servant and intelligent. 
Nor is itincumbent on teachers to anticipate the requirements 
of future life by giving the knowledge suited t0 weaining not 
this or that employment or profession. Todo that special but - 
would not only be to do grave injustice to the eral, 
child who did not mean to adopt the particular calling; but is 
would injure him who did, by prematurely specializing his 
knowledge and directing his thoughts into a certain money- 
making groove. The duty of the school is to call forth such 
activities and to give such knowledge as shall be available alike 
in all conceivable professions or employments; and it can do 
this rather by considering* oftener what intellectual wants are 
human and universal, than what is the way in which any par- 
ticular child is to get his livelihood. A well-educated English 
gentleman does not, it is true, know so much about a steam-en- 
gine as an engineer, nor 80 much about the rotation of crops as 
 
-P-A-G-E-377

  a farmer, nor so much about book-keeping as a city clerk, but 
he knows a great deal more about all three than either of them . 
knows about the other two; and this is simply because his 
faculty of thinking and observing has been cultivated on sub- 
jects chosen for their fitness as instruments of development, and 
not on subjects chosen with the narrow purpose of turning them 
to immediate practical use. 
There can be little doubt that in the education of the future 
Scientific a larger space will be occupied than heretofore by 
teaching of the discipline of the inductive sciences, and it will 
*. ‘be well if those of you who are entering the pro- 
fession will accept this as inevitable, and qualify yourselves 
both to meet the want and to guide a movement which must 
for good or evil have important consequences, It is for you to 
take heed that the newer knowledge shall be not less educative 
and inspiriting than the old, and that the word “science” shall 
not degenerate into the symbol for what is empirical and utili- 
tarian, nor for another kind of memory work, He who sets 
himself to do this has before him vast fields of usefulness. 
Lift up your eyes and look upon the fields, for they are white 
already to the harvest.” It may be that most of the teaching to be gained from Latin and Greek books has already been dis- cerereds and that the capacities of the older forms of academic tee have already been taxed to the uttermost, But in the

  XV. THE CORRELATION OF STUDIES. 
‘We have considered in succession the principal instruments 
Reviewot | Which are in a teacher’s hands for forming the 
fhe surrien- character and training the faculties of scholars, 
cho and it may be convenient here to recall them. 
There are (1) the teaching of mechanical arts as 
Reading and Writing, and generally the training of the pupil 
‘te action. (2) Instruction in useful information or Fact-lore, 
With a view to give the pupil knowledge. Then come the 
Studies which are specially intended to promote thought; (3) 
Language teaching, which gives command over the instru- 
‘ment of thought and of expression; (4) Mathematics, which 
gives the laws of ratiocination from generals to particulars; 
‘and (5) Inductive science which gives the habit of observation, 
and of generalization from particular experience. 
‘We have said that all these ingredients in a school-course 
should be within your view when you try to fashion a plan of 
study either for a primary or secondary school, for boys or for 
girls. We have also given some reasons for thinking that after 
a time both the first and the second kinds of teaching become 
relatively less important, and that in the main, and especially 
in the later stages of your course, the formative and disciplinal and therefore the best parts of school-training will be found to be composed of the last three elements. But we may now go further and say that a reasonable regard to all three is more consistent with thoroughness in teaching than the limitation Multum non to one. The maxim, non multa, sed multum, has moult a plausible sound, and seems to furnish a justifica- cation to those whose ideal is to secure thorough scholarship in

& pupil who leaves school, knowing only one language besides 
his own, and having learned it by comparison with his own, 
knowing also one branch of mathematics besides arithmetic, 
and one branch of Natural Science, is better educated—better 
fitted to receive all the subsequent knowledge which the ex- 
perience of life may bring, and to know what to do with it, 
than the classical scholar, the mathematician, or the scientist 
pure and simple. 
‘The good teacher secks to give to each class of faculty a fair 
chance of development. He knows that it is impossible to de- 
termine with certainty very early in a scholar’s career what, is 
the special department in which he is likely to achieve excel- 
lence, Nor is it at all necessary that you should know this too 
early. It has been often said that the ideally educated man is 
one who knows something of many subjects, and a good deal 
of one subject. You are safe therefore in fashioning a some- 
what comprehensive course so long as there is unity in it; and 
in making certain elements compulsory on all scholars, re- 
. serving alternatives and voluntary choice to the later stages of 
the school-life. You thus cast your net over a wider area, and 
prepare yourself to welcome a greater variety of abilities and 
aptitudes. You leave fewer minds to stagnate in apathy and 
indifference, and you discourage the tendency to attach an 
exaggerated value to particular subjects, and to indulge in the 
idle boast of learned ignorance. And if this be done, then 
when the time comes for specializing, and your pupil comes 
within sight of the University or of the business of life, you 
cwill be in a better position to determine in what direction and 
for what reason he will do well to direct his energies in a par- 
ticular channel. And in helping the pupil to decide. these 
questions it is well to have regard (1) to the probability that 
the study thus selected will be thoroughly assimilated, and will 
in his case be carried on far enough to become a factor of 
value in his intellectual life, and (2) to the chance of his 
putting forth real effort in its pursuit. For cateris paribus,

that study is the best for each of us which calls out the largest 
amount of spontaneous exertion, and in which we are not re 
cipients merely, however diligent, but willing agents. 
Although the threefold division of intellectual culture to 
Time not at- Which we have so often referred, should be clearly

Hed tthe plans, and though each division may well claim 
of subjects. an equal share in his attention, it does not follow 
that the time available in a school-course shall be given to these 
departments in equal proportions. It takes longer and harder 
work to achieve the desired intellectual result in some subjects 
than in others. A given amount of effort tells sooner in the 
easly stages of science-teaching than in those of language, You 
may make even a mathematical truth clear and effective for 
practical purposes in a shorter lesson than would be needed 
for instruction of equal value on a difficult point in grammar. 
And hence it may be roughly said that if you have say 20 hours 
of a week available for the serious study of disciplinal subjects, 
it is not unreasonable to give nearly half of these to language 
and literature and subsidiary exercises, and of the remaining . 
half, rather the larger portion to mathematics, and the smaller 
_ to experimental science. 
These considerations may help us when we find ourselves

  of logie consider that this is the cognate subject to mathe- 
matics; that it addresses itself to the same side of the mind, so 
to speak; and take the time for it out of that which would have 
been given to some branch of mathematics. If you feel dis. 
posed to go through a course of lessons on Political Economy, 
or the elements of Political Philosophy, such a course may 
very wisely supersede for a time the formal study of History, 
with which -it is closely related. And as to the subjects of 
Physical Science, it is never wise to have more than two in hand at a time, and the introduction of any one new branch of 
Physics or Chemistry may fitly take the place of another. The 
two principles to be kept in view are these: Do not permit 
Your day’s time-table to be cut up into fragments so small as to 
distract the attention of your scholars, and to interfere with 
due continuity of the studies; and take care that the general 
Proportion of time and effort given to each of the formative or 
disciplinal branches of study shall not be substantially dis- 
‘tarbed. We have before insisted on the need for unity of pur- 
Pose throughout the school-course and a regulated harmony in 
all its parts, This harmony is not disturbed when the scholar 
quits Arithmetic for Algebra, or Geometry for Trigonometry, 
or Botany for Geology, or Writing for Drawing; because in 
each case the new study is homogeneous with the old, and all 
that has been jearned before is made available for new pur- 
Poses, So long as a new subject is a fair intellectual equiva- 
lent for its predecessor, calls into action the same sort of force 
- and utilizes former knowledge, we need not be afraid of intro- 
ducing it, or of abandoning for a time the pursuit of some 
others which we value, . .

» gal sciences there are the doctrines of the conservation of energy- 
 
-P-A-G-E-383

  and also of the convertibility of forces. You know that heat 
is a mode of motion, that when you can generate one kind of 
force—say electricity—it is capable of transmutation into light 
or some other kind of energy, and that radiant energy itself is 
said to be convertible into sound, And there is a similar law 
of convertibility in intellectual forces. Every piece of knowl- 
edge honestly: acquired turns out to have unexpected relations 
with much other knowledge. Every kind of mental power, 
once evoked and applied to a worthy purpose, becomes avail- 
able for other purposes, and is capable of being transformed 
into power of another kind, Only take care that what you 
evoke is really power, that 6vvayuzs in your hands becomes 
true éyépy era, that the subject you teach is so taught as to 
stimulate, to broaden, to reach out into regions beyond itself; 
and then the question of the number of subjects nominally in- 
cluded in your curriculum becomes of very small importance. 
It is only the dull and soulless mnemonic after all which is 
utterly barren of result. Compare an artist or musician who 
is a mere artist or musician with one who also brings to his 
work knowledge of other things, intellectual breadth and sym- 
pathy. All that the one has been helped to know and to feel 
in other regions than art becomes transfigured and absorbed 
“into his work, and his work is more precious to the world in 
consequence.

  Phrenology. He was a man of very clear purpose and strong 
will, and had the art of inspiring his disciples with much en- 
thusiasm and admiration. But he never got so far as to induce 
one of them seriously to attempt the classification and teaching 
of aschool on his principles, and the experiment yet remains 
untried. There are others who would urge you to study the 
temperaments of children, and to give to the lymphatic, the 
sanguine, and the nervous scholars respectively, special and 
appropriate discipline. But I cannot counsel you to concern 
yourself much with such speculations. For there is first the 
danger that perhaps your diagnosis of the case may be wrong; 
‘and then there is the further danger that even if it be right the 
treatment you adopt may not be after all the best. It is not 
yet proved either on the one hand that the child with a particu 
lar liking or talent should have that tendency specially culti 
vated in his education, or, on the other hand, that it is always 
‘wise to attempt to restore the balance by working at the de- 
velopment of those faculties in which be is deficient. By all 
means watch your pupils: see if experience shows any particu- 
Jar form of intellectual exercise to be burdensome or injurious 
to them; give prompt relief to those who seem in the smallest 
degree to be disheartened or overwrought; and having done 
this, devise the best course you can in the interest of the aver- 
age scholar, and make all your pupils conform to it. Do you 
not in looking back on your own mental life feel thankful that 
you were forced to learn many things for which at the time 
you had no special appetite, and which a scientific analyst of 
your yet unformed character and tastes might have declared to 
be unsuited to you? 
In all this, I have said nothing of religious and moral 
teaching. But this is not because I disregard it, Religious and

the proportion of time assigned, rightly represent our estimate of the relative importance of this last element. For “Con- duct,” as Mr. Matthew Arnold says, “‘is three fourths of life,” and that a human being should do what is right and be ani- mated by noble motives in doing it, is, as we must all feel, 
more important than that he should possess any given piece of useful information, or should have had his understanding 
trained in 4 particular way. But this does not at all imply that you should give in a school lessons on ethics and religion 
corresponding in length or number to your sense of the impor- tance of those subjects. . 
Many of the best teachers feel that right moral guidance can 
‘Two views of ODly be had by direct didactic teaching, by thelearn- the functions ing of formularies of faith and duty, and by lessons in this consciously directed to the enforcement of theologi- cal truths. Other teachers, with ano less profound sense of the importance of these things, have grave doubts as to the usefulness of school lessons on such subjects. They distrust the practice of teaching children in the sphere of religion to do what they would not be asked to do in any other depart- ment of their studies—to affirm what they do not understand. They dread, above all things, exacting from a young child vows or professions of religion which cannot possibly correspond to his actual convictions and experience. Such teachers would be disposed to rely more on the habits which were formed in school, on the spirit in which its work was done, and on the sort of moral and religious principles which may be learned indirectly in 8 high-toned school, and are seen to penetrate all its corpor- ate life, than on formal lessons in divinity. I shall not attempt here to pronounce an opinfon on a controversial question which divides some of the most religious and high-minded teachers, ‘Two considerations only shall be offered on this point. ‘The first of them is that the expediency of giving direct reli-

  scholars’ leisure and are tn loco parentis, you will feel bound: 
to provide for the religious instruction and worship, both on 
Sunday and on other days, which are usual in a well-constituted 
Christian family. And if you have the supervision of a Primary 
school, you cannot leave out of view the fact that many of the 
children come from homes in which the name of God is seldom 
heard, and in which the parents feel it no part of their duty to: 
convey religious instruction to their children or to accompany 
them on Sunday to the house of worship. You will feel here 
that the only glimpse your scholar will have of the unseen 
world, the only teaching about his relation to a Divine Father, 
and the only introduction even to the morality and the poetry . 
_ of the New Testament, are to be had in the school. On the other 
hand, if your school is a day-school of a higher kind, and the 
scholars have parents who are accustomed to concern themselves 
about the religious training and conduct of their children; or- 
even who deliberately object to the inculcation of dogma at so - 
early an age, your responsibility is greatly lessened. There is 
in such a case no moral obligation on a master, unless he is re- 
quired to do so by the governors, to make the school. a propa- - 
ganda for his own or any other distinctive religious tenets. The. 
principle of a “ conscience clause,” I may remind you,.is not - 
only recognized in all recent University legislation; it is em- 
bodied in the Endowed Schools Act, in the Elementary Educa-* 
tion Act, and is in fact enforced on all schools to which publie 
legislation has yet been extended in this country; it is founded: 
_ 00 essential justice, and deserves to be yet more widely applied. : 
It has certainly not proved in any way incompatible with-the- 
Just influence of Christian teachers nor with the maintenance of : 
the religious character of English schools. oS 
Nor must we too hastily conclude that a school is a godless - 
school, because for any reason no direct didactic religious lessons - 
are given in it. Some of the weightiest lessons which we can. ‘| 
learn in regard to the formation of our own character are not,

eS 
of others, and what it is worth when tested by the exigencies 
of life. The ordinary history of a school presents many suck 
exigencies—many opportunities for effective moral teaching. 
Cases of misconduct arise which if dealt with calmly, seriously, 
and by a reference to a true and high standard of duty, have a 
very great effect upon the tone and feeling of the school. * You 
will not be satisfied always to employ mechanical: remedies 
for moral evils; but will direct attention from time to time to 
principles of conduct which have been illustrated or violated 
within the knowledge of your scholars. 
‘When such incidents occur in the school life, they should be 
‘themoratles. Utilized. But they will occur rarely, and they 
forte agny will be alt the more impressive if they are rare. 
It is not in the explicit didactic form in which older 
ofaschool people expect to see ethical truths and maxims 
expressed, that moral duties can be best made intelligible to a 
young scholar, and binding on his conscience. Much more 
effective work is done in his case by taking care that his sur- 
roundings are right and healthful; by watching carefully, 
though without actually removing them, such temptations to 
evil'as come within his reach, and by seeing that his daily life 
gives due scope and opportunity for the exercise of boyish vir- 
tues. And the schoolmaster, who has a high sense of responsi- 
bility in this matter, will often ask himself ‘‘ Are the arrange 
ments of my school calculated to promote truthfulness, manli- 
ness, the sense of honor, the feeling of moral obligation? Are 
the relations of my pupil to me such as to encourage him to treat 
me with confidence? Do they furnish him with occasions of 
being helpful to others? Does he take advantage of such occa- 
sions? Is he being trained in my school not merely to obey 
when the pressure of authority is upon him, but also to use 
freedom aright when he is a law unto himself? Is the virtue of 
courage taught not as an abstract lesson; but silently in the dis- 
cipline and habits of the school?’ For we may not forget what. 
Aristotle has taught us, that courage is, in one sense, the first of 
all virtues, because it is the one virtue which makes all others

  possible, without which, indeed, many others are well-nigh im- 
possible. For all untruth is traceable to cowardice. All idle- 
ness, desultory reading, extravagance, self-indulgence—nearly 
all in fact of the faults which you most desire that schoolboys 
should avoid,—come from lack of boldness to say “‘ No” when 
the temptation comes, and to make a resolute effort to do what 
is known tobe right. Trace out the consequence of a nerveless, 
soft and too indulgent discipline, when it comes to bear fruit in 
after-life. Consider what a man is likely to be worth who has 
not resolution enough to resist the public opinion of his class, 
to refuse to pronounce the Shibboleths of his party, to abstain 
from display and expense which he cannot afford, to emanci- 
pate himself from usages which he feels to be narrow and self- 
ish, in his profession or trade. . And when you think of these 
things you will see that in the microcosm of a good school there 
should be real training in courage and self-restraint, and that 
such training is often as effective when it is connected with the 
actual difficulties and temptations of school life, as when it 
forms part of a formal scheme of ethical or theological teaching. 
Further, it must be borne in mind that every one of the depart- 
Mients of secular teaching with which we deal in ‘no ethical 
schools carries with it its own special ethical les- feaching em- 
sons, holds them in solution, so to speak, and con- School-les- 
cemns itself in its own way with some important as- °°"* 
pect of human character. We saw in considering the practice of 
simple arts, and in all the mechanical drill which they involve, 
how the scholar learned obedience, exact attention to rule, self- 
subjugation, deference for others, and the habit of losing sight of 
his individual claims, while working towards the attainment of 
results in which others besides himself had a common interest. 
The study of Language too, when rightly conducted, is essen- 
tially a discipline in veracity, in careful statement, in abstinence 
from exaggeration, in thinking before we speak. Chaucer's 
host says: 
“Wke Plato sayeth, whoso can him rede | 
The wordes moste ben cosin to the dede;”*

  and George Herbert, 
“Lie not, but let thy heart be true to God, 
Thy mouth to it, thy actions to them both.” 
And the ideal in the mind of both poets you see is the perfect 
correspondence in a man’s character between the thing thought, 
the thing done, and the thing said. There is no truer test of a. 
consistent and noble type of life than this; and there is no intel- 
lectual training better fitted to develop such a type, than wise 
discipline in the use and mesning of language. In like manner 
| Mathematical science has its own special moral lessons, nome 
the less real because they are learned by implication only and 
are not formulated in precepts. It is a discipline in exactness, 
in perfect honesty, in patience. And of natural science and of 
all the studies pursued by the method of induction, have we not 
seen that they are a check on rash and hasty conclusions, that 
they teach fairness, breadth of mind, reticence, suspension of 
our judgment while the data for forming it are insufficient; and 
that these qualities are very necessary in the right conduct of 
life? As to History; it is full of indirect but very effective 
moral teaching. It is not only as Bolingbroke called it “ Phi- losophy teaching by examples,” but it is Morality teaching by 
examples. What, for instance, can be of higher value than the 
training it gives in the estimation of human character? We are called on to form judgments of men in very difficult positions, 
and we find a flippant and confident historian dismissing them 
_with a single sentence, giving his estimate on one or two inci- 
dents in their lives, or summing up their characters in an epi- gram. Well, we look into ourselves, and we think of the people by whom we are surrounded, and we know that neither their characters, nor our own, admit of being fairly summed up in an epigram or a single sentence, that he who would know us thoroughly and judge us fairly, should know something of our 
Powers and opportunities, our surroundings and temptations, and of the circumstances in which our opinions have been 
formed. History may thus become to those who study it a

  lesson in charity, and a training whereby we may learn how to 
form right estimates of each other. It is essentially the study 
which best helps the student to conceive large thoughts, “‘ to look 
before and after,” and to appreciate, as Mr. J. M. Wilson has 
wisely said, the forces of genius, of valor, of wisdom, and of en- 
thusiasm by which the world is moved. 
There is yet another sense in which it is impossible to over- 
value the moral teaching of History. One looks back over the 
annals of our race, and recalls the past. The echoes of fat-off 
contests and of ancient heroisms come down to us through the 
ages. “We have heard with our ears,‘and our fathers have de- 
clared to us the noble works which God did in their days, and 
in the old time before them.” We hear of Philip Sidney, thirsty 
and dying on the field of Zutphen, refusing the cup of water 
and giving it to a poor soldier with the words, “Thy necessity 
is greater than mine.” We recall the image of the saintly Bishop 
Ken, on the eve of the Declaration of Indulgence, as he stood 
with six other bishops before James in the presence-chamber at 
Whitehall, ‘We have two duties to perform, our duty to God, 
and our duty to our king. We honor your Majesty, but we 
must fear God.” Or we think of Wolfe the young soldier.on 
the heights of Quebec, spent and wounded after a hard fight, 
aroused by the cry; “They run.” “ Whorun?” “The French.” 
«Then I die happy.” And as we realize these scenes, we know 
that this world is a better world for us to live in because 
such deeds have been done in it; we see all the more clearly 
what human duty and true human greatness are, and we are 
helped by such examples to form a nobler ideai of the possibili- 
ties even of our own prosaic and laborious life. 
And thus it is quite possible that in a schoo] in which few 
formal lessons are given on morals and conduct, rpdirect mom 
the sense of a higher presence, and the habitual # teaching. 
recognition of the highest motives of action may suffuse the 
whole of the teaching, or run through its entire texture like —

  want most of all to exert a right influence over the character, 
avd you want too to gratify the legitimate demands of a 
child’s fancy, and to furnish food for his imagination. You 
want to regard him from the first as a being not only with 
duties to fulfil and a livelihood to win, but with a life to live, 
with tastes to be gratified, with leisure to be worthily filled. 
And hence you will never satisfy yourself by putting before 
him the usefulness of knowledge, the way in which it adds 
to the value of its possessor in the market of the world, 
the examinations it may help him to pass, the fortune or the 
credit it may help him to win; but you will rather try to help 
him perceive the beauty and worth of an intelligent life for its 
own sake. Ithas been profoundly said by Bacon that the light of 
heaven is not only precious to see by, but to see. Andof know- 
ledge too, i: may be truiy said that it is not only good to show 
us the way, and to help us to solve difficulties, It is also good, 
even if we solve no difficulties with it, and if we turn it tono 
definite commercial or other account, good if we only delight th its radiance and feel its warmth, and have our souls enriched 
and gladdened by it. Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for a man to behold the sun.” And a school is ‘avery unsatisfactory institution, and fails to fulfil its highest function, 
if; however it may succeed in imparting knowledge, it does not also succeed in imparting a thirst formore, or at least a dawning fense of the inward need for mental and spiritual cultivation, whether such cultivation bears any visible relation to success in life or not. 
And so the ideally perfect school is not only characterized, as bh have said in former lectures, by strict order, by right methods 
instruction, and by vigorous intellectual activity; it should also be pervaded through and through by high pu by the spirit of work, by a solemn sense of duty, and by the ‘love of truth. Does this seem to some of you an unattainable ideal? The firet condition of its being attainable is that you shall be lieve it worthy of attainment. Look back upon your own

ward into the life of your pupils, and ask what recollections 
they will have~what recollections you would like them to have, 
of you and of your teaching. Those recollections will not all be of the lessons you have intentionally given. They will depend 
much upon the spirit in which your work was done, on the mo- 
tives which were seen to actuate you, and on the degree in which , 
you were known to love that knowledge of which for the time 
you were in the scholars’ eyes tie chief representative. 
You remember well who it was who once stood by the lake 
of Genesareth and beckoned Andrew and Simon Vocation, 
away from their boats and thetr fishing-tackle with . 
the words, ‘‘Follow me: I will make you fishers of men.” 
That isa great parable; significant of the way in which, in all 
ages of the world, some are called out from the meaner and more 
mechanical employments of life, and invited to take a share in 
the noblest of ali work—in fashioning the intellect, the con- 
science, the character, the destiny of future generations of men 
and women. The call is not audible to all of us in quite the 
sameway. By some it is recognized in the circumstances and 
what seem the accidents of life. Some hear it in the whispered 
intuitions which tell of personal fitness and aptitude. To others 
the voice comes, asa weighty and solemn conviction of the im- 
Portance and usefulness of the work itself. But in some way or 
other the sense of the call ought to be present in the mind of 
every teacher, Without it the highest achievements of his art 
will be unattainable to him. With it, he will be in a position 
to make use of all the resources within his reach; he will have 
before him a true conception both of the road he has to traverse, i 
and of the goal towards which he moves. And he will ever 
possess within him one of the strongest of all motives to action; | 
for while he is doing his work, he will habitually recognize and | 
will teach his scholars to recognize the unseen presence in their 
midst of One who is the helper of all sincere learners, and the ‘ 
teacher of all true teachers.

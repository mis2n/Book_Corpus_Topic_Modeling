PREFACE 
In this volume I have attempted to give an 
account of the meanings of the word Eugenics, 
the aims of those who advocate a eugenic 
policy, and the more important of the 
problems which confront them. I have kept 
distinct the descriptions of certain researches 
directed towards the elucidation of these 
problems, in order to show as clearly as 
possible in what manner the work is being 
done; but I have endeavoured at the same 
time to indicate the bearing of each research 
on the subject as a whole. 
It is now my pleasant duty to thank 
those who have helped me, particularly 
Mrs A. C. Gotto and Mr A. F. Schuster. 
They both read the manuscript most care- 
fully and most kindly criticised it, thereby 
enabling me to eliminate much that was 
obscure or illogical, ungainly or ungram- 
matical. To the former I am also indebted 
for a good deal of the information contained 
in Chapter IIJ., and for many of the ideas 
expressed in Chapter XI., and to the latter 
for finding me the relevant passages in 
fe

my thanks are due for what has been taken 
from Plato’s Laws, and to Mr A. S. L. 
Farquharson for such knowledge as is dis- 
played of the. writings of Theognis and 
Aristotle, and also for reading and criticising 
the whole of Chapter II. For help on other 
points I would express my gratitude to Mr 
G. W. Smith and Mr R. R. Marrett. 
It is difficult to estimate exactly what one 
owes to published sources. Those from which 
special information is taken can be and are 
mentioned in the text or in footnotes; but 
there are some works whose influence on one 
is more general, and these it is impossible 
to deal with in this way. Though doubtful 
of the propriety of naming particular authors 
among the many whose works might be 
included in this class, I would be ungrateful 
not to acknowledge a certain debt to Mr and 
Mrs Whetham and Mr Havelock Ellis.

INTRODUCTION 
TuosE who seek to introduce a fresh policy 
into the regulation of human affairs must 
have clearly before them what end they 
desire to attain by so doing; and if they 
wish to commend their policy to the 
majority, they should be prepared_to demon- 
strate that the end itself is desirable, and 
that by the means propose ere is some 
hope of moving towards it. There are some 
who would claim that the ultimate goal of

ciency of the nation. We do not, T,

would rather recommend it as a road to 
increased happiness for the human race; or,

common leader, are confined to no country, 
and differ widely in their methods and 
beliefs; but they appear to the present 
writer to subscribe implicitly, if not explicitly, 
to a common creed, which may be outlined 
as follows :—Each individual, as he passes 
through life to its end in death, derives his 
active qualities at each moment, of what- 
ever nature they may be, from the inter- 
action of two separate, yet not wholly 
independent, causes. he one may be 
called his inborn potentiality or capacity | 
for develo e € c 
or the mental, moral, and physical surround- 
ings in which his life is spent.
-P-A-G-E-15
  EUGENICS i 
The inborn potentiality may h : 
eee es aed wl 
parts of it, or may depend on some mysterious 
“ property of living matter, unknown entirely 
to physical science. We need form no 
opinion of its ultimate nature, yet may 
“agree that it is largely derived from a similar 
capacity inherent in the parents or ancestry. 
This is the true meaning of heredity. We 
have no direct-means of judging what poten- 
tialities al case, 
but can only observe what active qualities 
of body or mind present themselves, and 
accordingly the outward manifestation of 
<heredity is the similarity shown between 
parents and children, ancestors and descend- 
ants, with regard to these. the ant 
potentiality has been called ‘nature,’ whi 
e term ‘nurture’ has been used to denote 
the environment. which -works—on_it—as_ it 
unfolds into recognisable qualities. Both 
these terms lack something in precision, and 
have degenerated into catch-words; yet, as 
there is nothing better to substitute for 
them, they will be used in the-senses just 
defined. 
Eugenists- differ from others who may 
equally have the good of mankind at heart, 
~ in that they assign a gre: tive wei 
to_ nature; they believ t_the greatest 
er_may be achieved

ing as far as possible the best t 
is provided by natures although they may also , 
strive to effect improvements in nurture. 
They believe that if among men and women 
ose_who are b er in min ad 
id. ore progeny behind them th: 
mankind will enter 
‘into a continuous advance towards increased 
happiness. The enormous and—indisputable 
changes produced by artificial selection in 
0) eS nimals, as well as the incom-_ 
arably greater changes in wild animals, 
attributed e    
   
   
al-selection, are evidence of a weapon 
ready to ite hand of him who can wield it. 
The Eugenist does not wish-to-follow blindly 
the methods employed either in the one case 
x the other, ‘but rather to devise some , 
curse of action which is suited to human — 
conditions as we know them; not to ride 
rough-shod over the spiritual feelings and 
pirations of mankind, but to take all into 
count and to seek a use for all. 
The foregoing remarks may be taken as 
roughly indicating what Eugenics is in so 
far as the word is used to denote a belief, or 
rather an ideal, As a belief it is somewhat 
vague, and one which needs to be made 
much more definite before it can be trans- 
lated into a practical policy. It is here that 
the science of Eugenics must be called to 
our aid: a science defined by Sir Francis

Galton as ‘the study of those agencies under

that the practical bearing of the study must 
not be lost sight of. It has for its aimethe 
discovery of means by which social control Bt 
may be applied for the improvement—of the cs 
If we were to limit ourselves too rigidly 
‘| by the definition, and in practice only /to 
study agencies which we know to be under 
social control, little progress would be made, 
for we cannot tell until after the study /has 
been completed what natural laws or social 
reactions can be consciously controlled’ by 
the individual ~or collective wil 69) 
human: group. 
7The endeavour must be made to under- 
stand as completely as“ possible all \those 
/forces, whether they be customs, economic 
' relations, habits of life, or bearers of death, 
which may affect the nature of these 
thousands who are daily born, either by 
altering for good or evil the qualities /of 
individuals, or by increasing or diminishing 
the proportion of the better to the worse. 
We are told by some that there is no science 
of Eugenics, but those who say so either 
define the term in some special way or have 
not followed the work which has been done 
in the subject in recent years. A common
-P-A-G-E-18
  14 EUGENICS 
dictionary definition of a science is that it is 
a ‘department of knowledge reduced to 
system’; but this definition neglects the 
idea of growth and change which are essential 
features of a living science. The knowledge 
must be systematised in such a way as to 
show where fresh material is needed and to 
facilitate its acquisition. That there is a 
science of Eugenics in this sense can fairly 
be claimed, although it is merely a founda- 
tion built with borrowed capital; but there 
is no mortgage on the building, no interest 
to pay, and no principal to refund, for 
wealth of this kind may be borrowed freely 
as often as it is wanted. 
Already many facts, inferences, and hypo- 
theses have been placed in orderly array, 
and many problems have been defined which, 
like the architect’s plans, should guide the 
further labour of the builders. It is the prin- 
cipal purpose of this volume to describe 
the former and define the latter in so far as 
it may be possible within the necessary 
limits. At the outset it may be as well to 
pass in brief review the problems with which 
we have to deal. 
First among these comes heredity. The 
dictionary tells us that this is ‘the trans-~ 
mission of characters or qualities of parents 
to their offspring.’ We will not for the 
moment quarrel with this definition; although 
it is not in accordance with modern scientific
-P-A-G-E-19
ot 
  EUGENICS 15 
views, it expresses roughly the older ideas on 
the subject and the popular opinion of the 
present day. Undoubtedly heredity mani- 
fests itself in the apparent transmission of 
characters or qualities of parents to their 
children, and, in consequence, two questions 
or groups of questions are raised. In the 
first place, to what extent and in what 
manner does this transmission occur, and 
what kind of characters or qualities are 
transmitted; secondly, by what mechanism 
is the transmission brought about. 
Heredity is placed first among the con- 
stituent parts of the science of Eugenics 
because, more than any other agency, it 
moulds the racial characters of future genera- 
tions. About this there can be no dispute. 
Without heredity, reproduction would be 
inconceivable, since the very term reproduc- 
tion implies that like produces like; and 
without reproduction there would not be 
any future generations of mankind. This 
may appear to be a fallacy, but it is not in 
reality. The appearance is due to the fact 
that the word heredity has been used in a 
different and truer sense to that with which 
we are most familiar. The qualities which 
strike our attention as being inherited are 
those which are not common attributes of 
the race, species, or variety, but are peculi- 
arities shown both by the apparent trans- 
mitter and the inheritor. Thus, when one
-P-A-G-E-20
  16 EUGENICS 
talks of heredity, one usually means the 
transmission of some peculiarity or special 
feature; but the common characters of the 
species or larger groups are as truly and more 
surely inherited, and if this were not so one 
could not talk of reproduction at all; there 
would, in fact, be no reproduction, though 
fresh living things might be produced. 
Heredity may be looked on as the agency 
principally concerned in determining ‘nature’ 
or the inborn potentiality. The next main 
question concerns nurture. Stated in a very 
simple way, it runs thus: ‘How far can 
differences of nurture acting on natures of an 
exactly similar kind produce realised differ- 
ences of quality?’ Or in a more concrete 
form one might ask to what extent are the 
great differences which we observe in the 
appearance, intellect, health, habits, and 
morals of human beings due to differences in 
their bringing up and in all the outside 
influences working on them, and to what 
extent are they due to their diverse inborn 
potentialities? Such questions are among 
the hardest problems to be faced; but in order 
to establish a case for Eugenics it is not 
necessary to find a complete solution. It 
must, however, be shown that a considerable 
part of the differences referred to are due to 
‘nature.’ 
We can pass on from these to another 
group of problems centred round the question :
-P-A-G-E-21
  
EUGENICS 17 
Will the outside environment acting on the 
parents affect them in such a way that the 
nature of the children will be altered? As 
a particular example, we may take the 
inquiry into the influence of parental alco- 
holism in the offspring, about which so 
much controversy has raged during the last 
two years. 
The next division of the subject concerns 
neither nature nor nurture, but selection. 
Classify the human race how one may, if 
each class reproduces itself at exactly the 
same rate heredity would have no action on 
future generations, whether for good or evil. 
But directly any sort of selection of par- 
ticular classes occurs, of such a kind that 
they multiply at it may be only a slightly 
higher rate than the rest, then heredity 
becomes a potent force in altering the destiny 
of mankind. In the first case it ensures con- 
stancy, and the second change. Thus, in 
addition to heredity, the selective agencies 
call for the earnest attention of Eugenists. 
These may be defined as the forces, tenden- 
cies, or events, whatever they may be, 
whether social customs, or economic pressure, 
or accidents of various kinds, affecting man- 
kind in such a way that certain classes or 
groups of individuals reproduce themselves at 
a higher or a lower rate than the rest. We 
probably recognise only a few of the selective 
agencies, but we are beginning to find out
-P-A-G-E-22
  18 EUGENICS 
something about some of them, and of these 
the differential birth-rate may be ranked as 
the most important. 
The difference between the birth-rate and 
the death-rate of any group would give its 
rate of increase if it were isolated, that is to 
say if it could not increase its numbers by 
immigration or reduce them by emigration 
of one kind or another. Thus the importance 
of the birth-rate will easily be understood. 
The birth-rate itself depends on things, such 
as the proportion of people who marry, the 
average number of children per marriage, and 
the duration of time between successive 
generations. Its differentiating action can be 
of many different kinds. It may cause one 
nation to increase at a higher rate than others. 
It might, and is indeed supposed to, affect 
the relative increase of different social classes, 
and of different religious or racial groups 
within the limits of a single nation; and, 
finally, within each of these classes or groups, 
individuals with particular characteristics 
might through this agency tend either to 
multiply or to die out. 
After classifying mankind in any or every 
way, Eugenics should therefore concern itself 
to discover which classes a high birth-rate is 
assisting to multiply more rapidly than others, 
It can then set about a problem of a different 
type, and obtain information without which 
the question of the relative increase of different
-P-A-G-E-23
  EUGENICS 19 
classes would be of very slight interest. The 
problem can be stated more easily by giving 
concrete examples. It is said that the 
higher social classes reproduce themselves 
at a lower rate than the rest, and thus that 
society is always recruiting itself from below. 
Let us grant that we know this for certain, 
yet in order to determine whether it is a fact 
of Eugenic value as tending to improve 
mentally and physically the racial qualities 
of future generations, or dysgenic in its 
action as tending to impair them, it is neces- 
sary to determine whether or no the higher 
classes have a heritable superiority in body 
or mind. Similarly, when we are told that 
Roman Catholics have larger families than 
Protestants, we want to know whether their 
religious beliefs are merely accidental or 
whether they spring in part from some inborn 
intellectual or emotional peculiarity. If the 
latter is the case, we must further ascertain 
whether such characteristics are likely by 
their perpetuation and multiplication to 
benefit mankind or not. 
In the study of these questions Eugenics 
must borrow from physical anthropology and 
the modern psychology, which proceeds by 
observation and experiment; and, above 
all things, it must endeavour to determine 
the relative parts played by ‘nature’ and 
‘nurture.’ We thus get back again to a 
branch of the subject that has already been
-P-A-G-E-24
  20 EUGENICS 
referred to and for the time dismissed, and 
this shows how closely bound together the 
whole subject is, and how impossible it is to 
subdivide it in a really logical manner. 
A consideration of differences in birth- 
rate leads on to the discussion of their causes. 
How far are they due to differences in natural 
fertility? How far to other factors? 
No less effectively than the birth-rate the 
death-rate may be selective on its action. 
For instance, it is urged by some that the 
mortality which is always heavy among 
infants may actually tend to improve the 
physique of the race by removing those who 
are on the whole weaker than the survivors. 
If this is the case, it is an instance of a selec- 
tive death-rate acting on the whole in a 
Eugenie manner. Other authorities point out 
that as the components of an army at the 
time of a great war are on the whole superior 
in physique to those who follow occupations 
at home, the death-rate of a large proportion 
of them, taken more or less at random, on 
the battle-field or in the camp, will have 
selective action of an exactly opposite kind, 
in that the better will be taken and the worse 
be left. The death-rate from particular 
diseases may be selective primarily in its 
tendency to remove those persons most 
liable to it, but secondarily if any special 
mental or physical quality is associated with 
the tendency.
-P-A-G-E-25
  EUGENICS 21 
Any practice which encourages or dis- 
courages marriage among certain classes may 
be selective in its action if the classes affected 
differ in some respect from the average. 
A modern example of this may be found in 
aviation. The army regulations discourage 
marriage among the military aeroplanists; 
thus a small body of men highly endowed 
with many noble qualities are prevented 
from reproducing their kind. This is not 
brought forward in any way as a criticism of 
the regulation referred to, which is no doubt 
perfectly wise, but merely as an example of 
marriage selection. Its dysgenic conse- 
quences fade into insignificance before those 
of the appalling death-rate among aviators. 
Among the older instances of marriage selec- 
tion possibly dysgenic in effect was that set 
up by the regulations, now largely relaxed, 
which confined the holding of fellowships at 
Oxford or Cambridge Colleges to bachelors; 
while the celibacy of the priests in the Roman 
Catholic Church may also have had a tendency 
to weed certain qualities out. 
A historian wishing to advance the study 
of Eugenics could perform no more useful 
task than to trace the effect of any of such 
selective agencies as have here been referred 
to on the rise or fall of some race or 
nationality. 
Let us take as the next branch of the sub- 
ject the causation of some special qualities
-P-A-G-E-26
  22 EUGENICS 
which seriously influence the welfare of the 
race. Idiocy, Insanity, Tuberculosis, on 
the one hand, and general or special ability 
on the other, may all be reckoned as belonging 
to this class. The same questions recur 
concerning them: How much are they due 
to nature, how much to nurture? If among 
the forces that produce them some are in- 
born, to what extent are these transmitted 
by inheritance, and in what manner? 
As a preface to the practical application of 
anything that Eugenics may teach, it is 
necessary to consider it in yet another way. 
Hitherto many questions have been out- 
lined, and as it will be seen later to only 
a few can answers be given; but one problem, 
and that one of the most vital, has not been 
touched on. How can any of the agencies 
under consideration be consciously and 
deliberately controlled? To what extent 
and in what direction are laws effective? 
What social customs or economic conditions 
make for racial improvement, and how can 
they be extended? It is necessary to investi- 
gate existing conditions and to analyse their 
tendencies to see how they may have acted 
in the past, and with what results. Marriage 
laws and customs should receive the par- 
ticular attention of Eugenists, though many 
other social phenomena may have almost as 
direct and as far-reaching an influence. 
But besides describing what is or has
-P-A-G-E-27
  EUGENICS 28 
been, it may be needful to discuss suggestions 
for future action. In this connection it is 
necessary to state emphatically that legisla- 
tion for Eugenic purposes is advocated by 
very few Eugenists. The majority would 
view the introduction of laws of this kind 
with profound distrust. When legislation of 
any particular kind for Eugenic purposes is 
being discussed, it is assumed by their critics 
that Eugenists necessarily advocate it. As 
it is often both futile and antagonistic to some 
principle of tried and recognised value, the 
spread of Eugenic ideals may be seriously 
impeded by such an assumption. So it is 
necessary to insist that the acceptance of 
these ideals does not imply adherence to any 
public policy of any kind whatsoever or 
approval of any special propaganda.

ideal a science of Eugenics is necessary, and 
of this science the foundations have already 
been laid. The questions which it is expected 
to answer are reviewed under six headings, 
but it is not claimed that they have been 
logically or exhaustively classified. They are 
briefly recapitulated below :— 
(1.) Heredity. To what extent and in 
what manner does the hereditary transmission 
of characters occur, and by what mechanism 
is it effected? 
(m.) In the development of individuals, 
is_taken_by ‘nature’ and what 
by ‘nurture’? 
(m.) In what manner and to what extent 
does the parental environment directly act 
on the ‘nature’ of the children? 
(Iv.) What influences can be detected 
which tend to increase or decrease the rate 
of multiplication of particular classes or 
races or groups of men having any differenti- 
ating characters in common? (This question 
raises a large number of subsidiary ones.) 
(v.) What causes bring about the advance 
or decline in the prevalence of special char- 
acters which we know or believe to be good 
or bad? 
(v1.) How can social control be applied to 
tions, either physically or mentally’?

CHAPTER II 
EUGENICS IN ANCIENT TIMES 
Evucenics is no new idea. It is suggested in 
the following passage taken from the works 
of the Greek poet Theognis of Megara, whe 
wrote in the first half of the sixth century B.c. 
Addressing his friend Cyrnus (Elegies 1183- 
192), he sings: ‘We look for rams and asses 
and stallions of good stock, and one believes 
that good will come from good; yet a good 
man minds not to wed an evil daughter of an

Wealth confounds our stock. Marvel not 
- that the stock of our folk is tarnished, for 
good is mingling with the base.’ About a 
century later Eugenics was discussed in 
some detail by Plato in the Republic and the 
Laws. In the former of these works Socrates 
is represented as laying down conditions for 
an ideal republic—the first Utopia. The 
scheme is developed in a series of conversa- 
tions with friends of diverse character, who 
from time to time raise objections which 
Socrates meets with much cleverness and

humour. The passage in which the idea of 
selective Eugenics on stock-raising lines is 
stated with the greatest clearness is a dialogue 
between Socrates and Glaucon. Glaucon i& 
a young man of quick penetration, of distinc- 
tion as a soldier, and experience as a lover; 
fond of art and music, and, what is of most 
importance in this connection, a practical and 
successful breeder of dogs and birds. 
Socrates says to him :—! 
‘And how can marriages be made most 
beneficial?—that is a question which I put 
to you, because I see in your house dogs for 
hunting, and of the nobler sort of birds not 
afew. Now, I beseech you, do tell me, have 
you ever attended to their pairing and 
breeding?’ 
Glaucon.—In what particulars? 
S.—Why, in the first place, although they 
are all of a good sort, are not some better 
than others? 
G@.—True. 
S.—And do you breed from them all 
indifferently, or do you take care to breed 
from the best only? 
G.—From the best. 
S.—And do you take the oldest or youngest, 
or only those of ripe age? 
G.—I choose only those of ripe age. 
S.—And if care was not taken in the 
1 Jowett, The Dialogues of Plato. Vols, III. and V. 
(Edition 3.5

EUGENICS 27 
breeding, your dogs and birds would greatly 
deteriorate? 
G.—Certainly. 
“ §.—And the same of horses and animals 
in general? 
G.—Undoubtedly. 
After some further conversation Socrates 
arrives at the conclusion that the rulers of 
his ideal republic would have to manipulate 
the unions of the citizens in such a way that 
the best of them should have the best mates, 
and the worst should intermarry among 
themselves. To avoid all the unpleasantness 
which he foresaw might arise from too much 
interference of the rulers in such a delicate 
matter, it would be absolutely necessary 
that the citizens should know nothing what- 
ever about it. So it is suggested that persons 
of marriageable age should be brought to- 
gether at semi-religious festivals, where, to 
the accompaniment of suitable hymeneal 
songs, they would draw lots for their mates. 
But Socrates goes on to say: ‘We shall have 
to invent some ingenious kind of lots which 
the less worthy may draw on each occasion 
of our bringing them together, and then they 
will accuse their own ill-luck and not the 
rulers.’ 
The less worthy, after being cheated into 
putting up with marriages against their 
inclinations, were not prevented from repro- 
duction, but good care was taken that their 
 
-P-A-G-E-32
  28 EUGENICS 
infants should not grow up in the republic. 
As for other reasons it was thought most 
desirable that all children should be brought 
up together in public créches, and that no 
parents should know which children were 
theirs, this little matter could be easily 
attended to, for Socrates suggests ‘The proper 
officers will take the offspring of the good 
parents to. the pen or fold, and there they 
will deposit them with certain nurses who 
dwell in a separate quarter; but the offspring 
of the inferior, or of the better when they 
chance to be deformed, will be put away in 
some mysterious unknown places, as they 
should be.’ 
The children were to be suckled by the 
mothers, but care was to be taken that no 
mother recognised her own child. ‘Care will 
also be taken that the process of suckling is 
not continued too long, and the mothers will 
have no getting up at night or other trouble, 
but will hand over all this sort of thing to 
the nurses and attendants.’ In order to 
prevent immature or senile parents! from 
having children, only women between twenty 
and forty years of age, and men between 
twenty-five and fifty-five, were to be allowed 
to attend the hymeneal festivals, and the 
total number of marriages was to be regulated 
1 The importance of marrying in one’s prime had no doubt 
been recognised much earlier by the Gnomic Poets of Greece 
(see Hesiod, Works and Days, line 695 and following).
-P-A-G-E-33
EUGENICS 29 
in such a way as to keep the numbers of the 
population at the most suitable level. 
In time of war, those who distinguished 
themselves in battle were to be rewarded by 
State aid in their love affairs. ‘The brave 
man is to have more wives than others;’ 
‘he is to have first choice in such matters 
more than others, in order that he may have 
as many children as possible.’ Thus we see 
that Plato suggests both the abolition of 
the household and polygamy for Eugenic 
purposes. 
The relation between medicine and 
Eugenics is often discussed at the present 
day, and some people maintain that in so 
far as medical aid allows the weak and sickly 
to survive and propagate their kind, it may 
in benefiting the individual do harm to the 
race. This was the view expressed very 
clearly by Plato; in a half-humorous passage 
he compares the older system of medicine 
with that practised in his own day, much to 
the advantage of the former. The following 
extracts of the remarks which he puts into 
the mouth of Socrates give the gist of his 
meaning :— 
‘If Asclepius (by whom he typifies the 
older school) did not instruct his descendants 
in valetudinarian arts, the omission arose, 
not from ignorance or inexperience of such 
a branch of medicine, but because he knew that 
in all well-ordered States every individual 
 
-P-A-G-E-34
  i\gt 30 EUGENICS 
has an occupation to which he must attend, 
and has, therefore, no leisure to spend: in 
continually being ill.’ ... ‘And therefore 
our politic Asclepius may be supposed to have 
exhibited the power of his art only to persons 
who, being generally of healthy constitution 
and habits of life, had a definite ailment; 
such as these he cured by purges and opera- 
tions, and bade them live as usual, herein 
consulting the interests of the State; but 
bodies which disease had penetrated through 
and through he would not have attempted 
to cure by gradual processes of evacuation 
and infusion: he did not want to lengthen 
out good-for-nothing lives, or to have weak 
fathers begetting weaker sons.’ 
Selective Eugenics was to be assisted by 
Lamarckian Eugenics. ‘For good nurture 
and education implant good constitutions, 
and these good constitutions taking root in 
a good education improve more and more, 
and this improvement affects the breed in 
man as in other animals.’ 
The idea of Eugenics is further developed 
in the Laws, in which work also an ideal 
scheme of government is suggested: This 
differs from that proposed in the Republic, 
in that the monogamous household is retained 
in a shadowy form. It will be seen that on 
many points modern ideas are foreshadowed 
with curious exactness. The taxation of 
bachelors, for example, has many serious  
-P-A-G-E-35
  
EUGENICS 31 
advocates at the present day, whose ideas 
could hardly be expressed more clearly than 
in the following passage: ‘He... who 
does not marry when he has arrived at the 
age of thirty-five, shall pay a yearly fine of 
a certain amount, in order that his celibacy 
may not be a source of ease and profit to 
him.’ The object of this suggested regula- 
tion was not to maintain the«birth-rate at 
a satisfactory level, but rather to check the 
‘impiety’ of refusing so good a gift as a wife 
and children. 
Plato’s treatment of ‘ Aleohol and Eugenics’ 
should also warmly commend itself to many 
modern exponents of the dangers of alco- 
holism. ‘Drunkenness is always improper, 
except at the festivals of the God who gave 
wine; and peculiarly dangerous when a man 
is engaged in the business of marriage, for 
at such a crisis in their lives a bride and bride- 
groom ought to have all their wits about 
them, and they ought to take care that their 
offspring may be born of reasonable beings; 
and who can tell on what day or night 
Heaven will give them increase? Moreover, 
they ought not to be begetting children 
when their bodies are dissipated by intoxica- 
tion, but their offspring should be compact 
and solid, quiet, and compounded properly; 
whereas the drunkard is all abroad in all his 
actions, and is beside himself both in body 
and soul. Wherefore, also, the drunken man 
   
-P-A-G-E-36
    
\ 82 EUGENICS 
is bad and unsteady in sowing the seed of 
increase, and is likely to beget offspring who 
will be unstable and untrustworthy, and 
cannot be expected to walk straight either 
in body or mind.’ 
It is not altogether clear whether Plate 
means that the general effect of parental 
alcoholism in the offspring is deleterious, or 
that the danger principally lies in the pro- 
creation of children during moments of 
intoxication ; or again, whether he fears 
that the moral effects of habitual drunken- 
ness on the drunkard are likely to be inherited. 
Temperance reformers at the present day 
are alive to the possibility of the second of 
these three alternatives; but the view that 
habitual alcoholism on the part of the 
parents has the effect of poisoning the germ- 
plasm! out of which their children are formed, 
and thus causing defects, is held more widely. 
With regard to the choice of mates, Plato 
gives in the Laws the following advice, 
which has a definitely Eugenic purpose ;— 
‘People must be acquainted with those into 
whose families they marry, and to whom 
they are given in marriage; in such matters 
as far as possible to avoid mistakes is all- 
important, and with this serious purpose 
let games be instituted in which youths and 
maidens shall dance together, seeing and 
being seen naked, at a proper age and on 
1 Vide Chapter IV. for definition of germplasm.
-P-A-G-E-37
  EUGENICS 88 
a suitable occasion, not transgressing the 
rules of modesty.” 
He further goes on to say that for the 
benefit of the State one should avoid the 
natural inclination to marry one who is 
similarly situated to oneself, both with 
regard to personal characteristics and to 
pecuniary circumstances. A rich man should 
marry into a poor family, and a dull man into 
a quick-witted family. An equable popula- 
tion without too much diversity in mind, 
body, or estate among its members would 
thus result. After marriage ‘the bride and 
bridegroom should consider that they are 
to produce for the State the best and fairest 
specimens of children which they can.’ 
The Laws was written some time after the 
Republic, when the author was at least seventy- 
four years of age, and from the extracts here 
given it is apparent that he had devoted 
a preat deal of thought to the problems of 
Eugenics, and the central idea that it would 
be advantageous to the community that 
marriages of men and women should be 
arranged so as to produce the best possible 
children is quite clearly and definitely stated. 
The means suggested in the Republic for 
bringing this about were not intended as 
a scheme practically applicable at his own 
day, and the most ironical of Greek authors 
must not be taken too literally. 
Many of the details of Plato’s scheme were
-P-A-G-E-38
  34 EUGENICS 
criticised by Aristotle in the Politics, a work 
also dealing with the art of government. 
But Aristotle, although a great naturalist 
and the son of a physician, is concerned more 
with the political than with the biological 
aspect of the question. He aims rather at 
securing good social and economic conditions 
than at improving the human breed. Thus 
when he advocated restrictions on the increase 
of population, it is principally on the ground 
that too rapid an increase would lead to 
inequitable distribution of property, and 
secondly, that overwhelming numbers cannot 
be reduced to order. He retains the family 
group on moral grounds, but is not afraid to 
claim for the State a vigorous control of its 
marriage arrangements. He is especially 
alive to the desirability of making the 
conditions such that the children born 
shall be as healthy as possible, and for this 
reason discountenances too early marriages. 
‘Marriage at a youthful age has a prejudicial 
influence upon the procreation of children. 
It is a law of the whole animal world that the 
offspring of youthful parents are imperfectly 
developed, are apt to procreate females, and 
are small in body, and we must conclude the 
same to be the case among human beings. 
We infer it from the fact that in all States 
in which the practice of youthful marriage 
is in vogue, the citizens are imperfectly 
developed and small in stature. Another
-P-A-G-E-39
  EUGENICS 35 
objection to such marriages is that young 
women are greater sufferers in travail, and 
die oftener.’! 
He also expressed an opinion, which was 
shared by Pythagoras, and was in accord 
with Greek practice, that the winter is the 
best season of the year for marriage, and he 
recommends that ‘The parents themselves, 
in view of the procreation of children, should 
pay attention to the rules of physicians and 
natural philosophers, the former of whom 
are competent authorities upon the occasions 
suitable to their physical condition, and the 
latter upon the various kinds of winds, 
northerly winds being in their judgment 
preferable to southerly.’ 
The following advice to mothers is un- 
questionably sound :—‘Women should take 
care of their bodily health during pregnancy, 
not leading a life of indolence, nor yet adopt- 
ing a scanty diet.’ Aristotle suggested that 
they should be prevented by law from leading 
a life of too great indolence, for they should 
be compelled to take daily a ‘certain walk 
to render service to the gods whose function 
it is to preside over child-birth.’ As the 
temples of these divinities were placed for 
ceremonial reasons without the walls of 
many Greek cities, the constitutional pre- 
scribed would be of some length. He goes 
on to say that ‘their mind... should be 
1 Weldon’s translation of Aristotle's Politics.
-P-A-G-E-40
  36 EUGENICS 
at such a time comparatively indolent and 
free from anxiety, as we see that the children 
are affected by the state of the mother during 
pregnancy just as plants by the condition of 
the soil.’ 
One other writer, namely Campanella, 
should be mentioned before closing this 
chapter, because he is regarded by Have- 
lock Ellis as the ‘prophet of modern 
Eugenics.’ 
Campanella was a monk; he lived at the 
beginning of the seventeenth century, and 
while in prison wrote a book entitled The 
City of the Sun, in which, as in Plato’s 
Republic and More’s Utopia, an ideal state 
is depicted. To judge from the brief account 
of his work, which appears in Havelock 
Ellis’s book, The Task of Social Hygiene, 
his ideas on Eugenics were taken almost 
directly from Plato. Only valorous and 
high-spirited men were to be allowed to 
procreate, and marriages, when made for 
the purpose of having children, were to 
be arranged by ‘“The Great Master,” a 
physician aided by the chief matrons, and 
the public exercises of the youths and 
maidens, performed in a state of nakedness, 
were of assistance in enabling unions to be 
fittingly made.’ The inspiration of Plato 
appears fairly obvious in this passage, and 
it is difficult to see that Campanella has 
improved materially on Plato’s ideas.

SUMMARY OF CHAPTER 
Eugenics and many associated problems 
are discussed in two of the works of Plato— 
namely, the Republic and the Laws. In the 
former the possibility of improving the 
human breed by the arrangement of suitable 
marriages, in something the same way as 
the breeding of horses and hounds is 
earried on, is discussed in a perfectly clear 
manner. 
It is also suggested that marriages should 
be confined to persons of suitable ages, that 
those who were brave in battle should be 
rewarded by the quantity and quality of the 
fair placed at their disposal for matrimonial 
purposes, and that there was something to 
be said, on Eugenic grounds, against a system 
of medicine which enabled the weak and 
sickly to propagate their kind. 
In the Laws it is proposed to place a tax 
on bachelors over thirty-five years of age. 
The special dangers of parental alcoholism 
are pointed out, and the advantages are 
insisted on of having the fullest oppor- 
tunities for knowing as well as possible 
the people among whom one is going to 
marry. 
Aristotle also, in his Politics, urges the 
desirability of arranging the conditions of 
marriage in such a way that the children 
born should be as healthy as possible.

The Eugenic ideas in Campanella’s City 
of the Sun, which are described by Have- 
lock Ellis, seem to be taken from those 
of Plato. 
CHAPTER III 
SIR FRANCIS GALTON AND THE SPREAD OF 
EUGENICS AT THE PRESENT DAY 
Francis GALTON was born near Sparkbrook, 
Birmingham, in the year 1822. It is worth 
while giving some account of his life, in order 
to show how wide and varied was the experi- 
ence, and how thorough the knowledge of 
life which led him to found and further the 
study of Eugenics. His Memories of my Life 
is the principal source from which is derived 
the following information. 
His paternal grandfather, Samuel John 
Galton, was a Quaker by religion, a banker 
and manufacturer by profession, and a 
scientist, naturalist, and statistician bv incli- 
nation. He made a considerable fortune, 
partly as a contractor for the supply of 
muskets to the army during the Napoleonic 
Wars. 
On the mother’s side his grandfather was 
Dr Erasmus Darwin}, well known as a 
physician, poet, and philosopher, whose 
1 This information is derived from the Dictionary of 
National Biography. 
 
-P-A-G-E-43
  EUGENICS 89 
poetical works dealt largely with natural 
history. One of them, called the Botanic 
Garden, included parts entitled The Lives of 
the Plants and the Economy of Vegetation. 
In his prose writings he propounded a theory 
of Evolution which had some points in 
common with that of Lamarck. Erasmus 
Darwin married twice; of his sons by the 
first wife, one, Dr Robert. Darwin, was the 
father of Charles Darwin, the famous natural- 
ist, who in his turn became the father of many 
distinguished sons. A daughter by the 
second wife, who married Samuel Tertius 
Galton, was Francis Galton’s mother. 
Samuel Tertius Galton was the eldest son, 
and carried on the banking business. He 
also had the taste for science and statistics 
shown by his father, and to a more marked 
degree by his son Francis. 
Francis Galton’s early education was of 
a literary kind, conducted by an invalid 
sister considerably older than himself; but 
at the age of eight he was sent to a school 
at Boulogne, which was ‘hateful to him in 
many ways and lovable in none.’ He stayed 
there for two years and then went on to a 
small private school at Kenilworth, from 
which, at the age of fourteen, he passed 
to King Edward’s School at Birmingham. 
The education there was strictly classical. 
Grammar and the rudiments of Latin and 
Greek were taught, probably well, as many
-P-A-G-E-44
  40 EUGENICS 
good scholars were turned out from the 
school, but in a manner which failed to arouse 
Galton’s interest. At the age of sixteen he 
left and embarked on the preparation for his 
chosen profession of medicine. The medical 
eurriculum in the thirties and forties of last 
century was a very different thing to what it 
is now, particularly in that practical experi- 
ence was obtained before the theoretical 
training. So Galton entered the Birmingham 
General Hospital as an indoor pupil; he 
found the work interesting, and being soon 
placed in a position of considerable responsi- 
bility as dispenser and dresser, often had 
many surgical cases at the same time under 
his care. The account of his experiences there 
gives one a very lively idea of the nature of 
surgical treatment at that time. After 
leaving the Birmingham hospital he went to 
King’s College, London, where he remained 
up till the age of eighteen years, attending 
lectures on science, and studying medicine 
as a pupil at King’s College Hospital. 
In the spring of 1840 an ardent desire for 
travel seized him, and his father arranged that — 
he should go to Giessen to attend the lectures 
of the famous chemist, Liebig. He soon 
found that his knowledge both of German and 
Chemistry was inadequate to enable him to 
derive any benefit from these lectures, and 
he set off alone to travel in the East as long 
as the money at his disposal would allow.
-P-A-G-E-45
  EUGENICS 41 
As an indication of the hardships and dis- 
comforts of travelling in the year 1840, even 
in civilised countries, it may be mentioned 
that on the homeward journey it took seven 
days and eight nights to reach Boulogne by 
diligence from Milan. From this some idea 
may be gained of the adventurous spirit and 
practical ability of a boy of eighteen who set 
out alone and accomplished a_ successful 
journey, extending as far from home and in 
such wild places as Greece and Asia Minor. 
In the autumn, after his return, Galton 
went up to Trinity College, Cambridge, where 
his talents threw him into the society of all 
the best undergraduates of the day. Many 
of these afterwards attained distinction of 
various kinds in varying degree, as, for 
instance, Sir Henry Maine, Lord Justice Kay, 
and Tom Taylor. He showed here his talent 
for friendship and discriminating apprecia- 
tion of the good qualities of his fellows, 
characteristics which more than any other 
prevent a clever man from turning into a 
crank and keep sane his outlook on the world. 
But though taking such full advantage of 
the social opportunities which are among the 
principal benefits of a career at Oxford or 
Cambridge, Galton applied himself with very 
great energy to the acquisition of mathe- 
matical knowledge, with the unfortunate 
result that in his third year his health broke 
down, and he was obliged to take a long rest 
 
-P-A-G-E-46
  42 EUGENICS 
and to abandon the idea of obtaining honours 
in mathematics. So after taking a poll! 
degree he attended lectures on medicine in 
Cambridge, and then went for a time to 
St George’s Hospital in London. On the 
death of his father in 1844, Galton, not yet 
having fully recovered his health, abandoned 
his medical career and set out on further 
travels. The first place visited was Egypt, 
where with two companions he penetrated 
up the Nile as far as Khartoum, travelling by 
river to Korosko, then by camel across the 
desert to Abuhamed, and thence onward by 
boat. Khartoum was at that time much 
beyond the range of ordinary tourists. 
From Egypt Galton went to Syria, and 
after returning settled in Leamington with 
his family, where he hunted and shot and 
fraternised with the hard riding and hard 
living set who formed the Leamington Hunt 
Club. From 1846-50 he spent much time in 
London, but he saw a good deal of other parts 
of the British Isles. For recreation he hunted 
with the Queen’s Stag Hounds, took walks 
and riding tours, tried ballooning; while at 
the same time he did much serious reading, 
and invented a device called the telotype for 
printing telegraphic messages. 
In 1850 he set out for a voyage of serious 
exploration in South-west Africa, which was 
‘A degree taken without honours, corresponding to 
the Oxford pass degree,
-P-A-G-E-47
EUGENICS 43 
carried to a successful conclusion in the face 
of great hardship and difficulty. His success 
was recognised by the Royal Geographical 
Society, who, in 1854, awarded him one of 
their two annual gold medals. His experi- 
ence of travel was turned to good account at 
the time of the Crimean War, in a course of 
lectures on camp life given gratuitously at 
Aldershot, to the officers stationed there. Our 
soldiers were at that time quite ignorant of 
the subject, but Galton’s offer to the War 
Office thus to communicate his own experi- 
ence received no answer from them till it 
was brought directly to the attention of the 
Prime Minister. 
From that time onward Galton lived 
principally in London, and began there the 
pioneering work on various scientific problems 
which he kept up till the end of his long life. 
Meteorology was one of the first subjects 
which claimed his attention, and he enriched 
it by discovering and naming the anticyclone, 
an atmospheric system, the persistence of 
which was so heartily cursed in the summer 
in 1911, and so earnestly prayed for in 1912. 
. Geography he was always keenly interested 
in, and as a member of the Council of the 
Royal Geographical Society he came in touch 
with all the famous explorers of the day, 
and in his book tells much that is of great 
interest about their characters and quarrels. 
But it is by his work on heredity and on 
   
-P-A-G-E-48
ee ee Tee Ss ee ee ee 
44 EUGENICS 
the subjects into which it led him, that 
Galton’s scientific fame was principally gained. 
Stimulated by the publication of the Origin 
of Species in the year 1859, and ‘impressed 
by many obvious cases of heredity among 
the Cambridge men’ of his own time, he gave 
much serious thought and hard work to the 
subject, and published the first results in 
Macmillan’s Magazine for 1865. The articles 
in question were called ‘Hereditary Talent 
and Genius,’ and besides treating of the sub- 
jects indicated by the title they contained 
his first utterances on Eugenics. We cannot 
follow in detail the subsequent stages of 
Galton’s work on heredity, though some 
aspects of them will be dealt with in a later 
chapter. Here it may be noted that they 
gave rise to his inquiry into ‘Human Faculty’ 
and to the organisation of much anthropo- 
metric investigation. The measurement of 
the proportions of human beings, which is 
comprised in anthropometry, led him to the 
consideration of Bertillon’s system for the 
identification of criminals, and then in turn 
to other possible methods of Personal Identi- 
fication. As a result, he devised the finger- 
print system which is now in use at Scotland 
Yard almost in its origina) form, and with 
some modifications has spread from England 
to many other countries. 
While devoting so much energy to scientific 
work in so many fields, Galton was always the 
 
-P-A-G-E-49
  
EUGENICS 45 
very opposite of a recluse. He had ample 
opportunities and the power for making 
friends of all the men of distinction in his 
day, and he used them to the full. He 
attached great importance to thc opinions of 
his friends, and consulted them freely about 
his scientific undertakings. He must be 
regarded as a man with a knowledge of men 
and things far beyond the ordinary, eminently 
receptive and inventive, and always in touch 
with life at a thousand points. His intellect 
was quite unclouded up till his death in 1911. 
He was no mere benevolent constructor of 
Utopias, but a man whose exceptional 
originality of mind was always guided by an 
equally remarkable experience of human 
nature and life. 
As has been previously stated, Galton gave 
utterance to his earliest views on Eugenics 
in 1865, in two articles published in Mac- 
millan’s Magazine. Writing in 1908, he 
says: ‘They expressed then, as clearly as 
I can do now, the leading principles of 
Eugenics.’ He again referred to the question 
in his book on Human Faculty, in 1884, and 
there the word Eugenics was first intro- 
duced in describing as follows some of the 
objects of the work. 
‘Its intention is to touch on various topics 
more or less connected with that of cultiva- 
tion of ‘race, or as we might call it, with 
“Eugenic” questions.’ 
 
-P-A-G-E-50
  
46 EUGENICS 
The nature of such qualities as energy and 
delicacy of sense-perception are investi- 
gated, and in certain cases an estimate of 
their value to the race is given. 
Thus of -energy Galton writes, ‘In any 
scheme of Eugenics, energy is the most 
important quality to favour; it is, as we have 
seen the basis of living action, and is eminently 
transmissible by descent.’ 
Galton again returned to the subject of 
Eugenics in the year 1901, when he delivered 
the ‘Huxley Lecture’ before the Anthropo- 
logical Institute, on the ‘Possible Improve- 
ment of the Human Breed under existing 
conditions of Law and Sentiment.’ This 
lecture, which was followed by others read 
before the Sociological Society a year or two 
later, aroused considerable public interest on 
the subject, which has since then continued 
to grow and spread. 
In order to facilitate research into the 
many problems involved, Galton founded, 
in the year 1904, a Research Fellowship at 
London University. Early in 1905 the 
present writer was appointed to this post, 
and worked, partly under Galton’s immediate 
direction, in a room rented by University 
College in Gower Street. Shortly afterwards 
a research scholarship was added, and filled 
by Miss E. M. Elderton. After the resigna- 
tion, in 1907, of the first Research’ Fellow, 
the institution, originally called ‘The Eugenics
-P-A-G-E-51
  
EUGENICS 47 
Record Office,’ was placed under the superin- 
tendence of Professor Karl Pearson, who had 
from the outset kindly and willingly responded 
to all requests for advice and help. Its 
name was changed from ‘Record Office’ to 
‘Laboratory.’ Dr David Heron was then 
appointed Research Fellow, and from time 
to time other members of the staff have been 
added. 
_ On Galton’s death his residuary estate 
was bequeathed to form a permanent endow- 
ment of the laboratory. It was his wish that 
no part of the money should be spent on 
building, and that a professorship should be 
established which Professor Karl Pearson 
should be invited to hold. The latter accepted 
the position, so. the result has been to place 
the laboratory on a much firmer footing, 
without involving any change in its personnel. 
Its activity has been indicated by the pro- 
duction of a long series of memoirs, many of 
them involving first studies of problems of 
exceptional difficulty. Some will be referred 
to in detail in subsequent chapters. Galton’s 
foundation is essentially and almost entirely 
an institution for research; it does not 
directly aim at the spread of Eugenic ideals 
or even at generally diffusing such small 
knowledge of the subject as is at present 
available. 
For the latter objects the Eugenics Educa- 
tion Society was founded in the year 1908, 
 
-P-A-G-E-52
  48 EUGENICS 
and under the honorary secretaryship of 
Mrs Gotto has pursued since then an active 
eareer. The direction of its policy is in the 
hands of a council of forty members. Galton 
himself joined the Society as honorary 
president, while the acting president is now 
his cousin, Major Leonard Darwin. 
The aim of the Society is principally to 
encourage people to think about Eugenics, 
and as a means to that end it holds meetings, 
at which different phases of the subject are 
discussed from many points of view. It 
publishes a journal entitled the Eugenics 
Review, the contents of which include many 
of the papers read before the Society, reviews | 
and notes on much relevant literature, both 
books and periodicals, and reports of such 
Parliamentary and other proceedings as are 
of interest to Eugenists. It is, in fact, a very 
well-conceived and useful periodical. 
The Society endeavours to examine by 
means of more or less expert committees the 
tendency of proposed legislation, in order to 
use its growing influence to support what is 
Eugenic and to oppose what is dysgenic. 
Its further activities include the organisation 
of lectures of various kinds to suit different 
audiences, and where occasion arises the 
encouragement of co-operative research. 
It has branches in Belfast, Birmingham, 
Glasgow, Haslemere, Liverpool, Manchester, 
five in New Zealand, and one in Australia.
-P-A-G-E-53
  EUGENICS 49 
In 1911, at the instigation of this Society, 
the Congress of National Health at Dublin 
included a Eugenics Section, and during the 
summer of 1912 the first International 
Eugenics Congress was held in the buildings 
of the University of London. The Congress 
attracted more than 700 members, and as 
its proceedings were fully reported and 
sympathetically commented on by all the 
more reputable London papers, it must have 
had a wide influence in bringing the notion 
of Eugenics home to the public. Among the 
members of the Congress were many dis- 
tinguished scientists and public men from the 
United States, Germany, France, Belgium, 
Denmark, Norway, Italy, and Spain, as well 
as from our own and many other countries, 
and its proceedings contained a great deal of 
interest and importance which will as occasion 
arises be more fully dealt with in this volume. 
Another agency ‘which has incidentally 
been instrumental in spreading ideas on 
Eugenics in this country is the National 
Council for Public Morals, which takes for 
its motto the following quotation: ‘The 
foundations of National Glory are set in the 
homes of the people. They will only remain 
unshaken while the family life of our race 
is strong, simple, and pure.’ Though this 
sentence implies that their object is ‘National 
Glory,’ they are really striving for something 
that is broader and of purer gold, even ia E. 
 
-P-A-G-E-54

‘it may glitter less. One of their methods is 
the publication of a series of New Tracts for 
the Times, of which at least two advocate 
Eugenics as a means of accelerating a process 
styled by the National Council, with perhaps 
unintentional pessimism—‘Race Regenera- 
tion.’ 
In other countries the idea of Eugenics is 
also spreading widely and rapidly. This is 
particularly the case in the United States.! 
Researches bearing directly on the subject 
have been carried out in that country from 
1874 and 1875 onwards. Among the first 
of these was the investigation by Robert 
Dugdale of the ‘Jukes’ family, from which an 
inordinate number of criminals and other 
undesirables have sprung. Much evidence of 
a similar kind has been published in the 
proceedings of the National Conference of 
Charities and Correction and of the American 
Prison Association. 
The inheritance of Deaf Mutism has also 
been systematically investigated since the 
publication, in 1888, of Dr Alexander Graham 
Bell’s Memoir upon the Foundation of a Deaf 
Variety of the Human Race. 
In addition to this early Research Work 
a propagandist proposal was made by Loring 
Moody of Boston in 1881. He suggested the

establishment of an Institute of Heredity, 
which, by means of providing lectures and 
a library, should diffuse ‘knowledge on the 
subject of improving our race by the laws 
of physiology.’ Death prevented Moody 
from realising his proposals, and it was many 
years before any idea of the kind was sug- 
gested again. 
In 1903, probably owing to the enthusiasm 
for the scientific methods aroused by the 
re-discovery a year or two previously of 
Mendel’s results, the American Breeders’ 
Association. was formed to acquire a know- 
ledge of heredity for practical application 
in the breeding of plants and animals. In 
1906, two years after Eugenics had found 
in England an official home at the London 
University, this Society appointed a com- 
mittee on Eugenics, which, in 1910, was 
converted into an autonomous section. The 
chairman is Dr David Starr Jordan, author 
of The Blood of the Nation and The Human 
Harvest, both works dealing with Eugenics; 
and the secretary is Dr C. B. Davenport, 
director of the Department of Experimental 
Evolution of the Carnegie Institution at 
Cold Spring Harbour, Long Island. 
The Eugenics section carries on its work 
of investigation by means of committees of 
experts, which it appoints to consider special 
problems. It has also established a Eugenics 
Record Office at Cold Spring Harbour, with
-P-A-G-E-56
  52 EUGENICS 
a@ permanent staff under the special superin- 
tendence of Mr H. H. Laughlin, the general 
direction of which is in the hands of Dr 
Davenport. The principal work of the office 
is the collection of pedigrees intended to 
elucidate the laws governing the inheritance of 
special mental and physical qualities in man. 
That the idea of Eugenics has spread almost 
too rapidly among certain sections of the 
American public is shown by the passing 
of many laws of a rather hasty and ill- 
considered kind—a process for which the 
American Constitution appears particularly 
well adapted. 
In Germany the aims of Eugenics are 
pursued under the title of Race Hygiene, 
which means the promotion of agencies for 
the betterment of future generations, different 
from, but analogous with, hygienic measures 
for the betterment of the existing generation. 
The German Society for Race Hygiene is 
grouped with societies having similar objects 
in other*countries to form an International 
Association, which thus defines its aims!:—

its purpose— 
(a) By advancing scientific, racial, and 
social biology, including racial and 
social hygiene, and in particular by the 
collection and registration of those facts 
concerning the normal and patho- 
logical nature of body and mind, 
which are important in the study of ©

(c) By drawing closer together the members 
of the Society who are willing to 
regulate their own lives in accordance 
with the motives of the Society— 
firstly, by earnest efforts to keep them- 
selves in good condition in body and 
mind; secondly, by pledging them- 
selves to ascertain before marriage, 
according to the directions of the 
Society, whether they are fit for it, 
and if unfit, either to remain un- 
married or to refrain from parent- 
hood; thirdly, by promoting. the 
iudividual and racial well-being of the 
rising generation.

The International Association for Race 
Hygiene consists of the German Society, 
which has branches in Munich and Berlin, 
and the Swedish Society for Race Hygiene; 
it has also individual members in many other 
lands. 
In France, a committee was formed in 
connection with the International Congress, 
of which many of the members were men 
of world-wide reputation, as anthropologists, 
neurologists, alienists, statisticians, and 
students of heredity and medicine, and 
since then a permanent Society has been 
founded. Strong committees were also formed 
in Italy and Belgium. In Denmark a section 
of the Anthropological Committee has been 
appointed to consider eugenic questions, 
while as a result of the Congress, the study 
of Eugenics in Belgium has been placed on 
a firm footing by the establishment of a 
Eugenics Section at the Institut Solvay. It 
would be out of place here to give a complete 
account of this Institution, which has no 
parallel in any other European country; but 
in order that due significance may be at- 
tached to its latest step, it is necessary 
to give some sort of indication of its nature. 
It was founded by M. Solvay in 1902, and 
established in a large and handsome build- 
ing in the Pare Léopold at Brussels. Its 
object is to facilitate the study of sociology, 
which comprises all questions concerning the
-P-A-G-E-59
  EUGENICS 55 
structure, working, and evolution of society. 
Sociology includes on the one side industrial 
and economic problems, and on the other side 
the social applications of biology; the science 
of Eugenics may thus be rightly regarded 
as a branch of it. The instutute in question 
is equipped with a scientific and adminis- 
trative staff, a magnificent library, and a 
bibliography of everything that appears on 
the subject of sociology. Its resources are 
at the disposal of persons engaged in making 
sociological researches, and in order to 
encourage work of this description prizes 
are offered yearly for investigations on par- 
ticular problems. 
In Holland a committee has been formed 
to urge the need of medical research before 
marriage, and ‘To convince mankind that one 
is morally bound to ask for medical advice 
before marriage, which ought to be done, 
both in the interest of the inquirers and of the 
offspring. The committee declares itself 
against interdiction of marriage. 
In addition to the societies and institu- 
tions organised either wholly or partly for 
the advance of Eugenics, there are many 
movements on foot with objects which might 
be considered as Eugenic in their nature if 
they were pursued as parts of a larger scheme. 
Of these perhaps the two which have most 
importance are those intended to protect the 
young against the dangers which arise from

their own sexual life, and to Sic: mothers 
during and after pregnancy. 
SUMMARY OF CHAPTER 
The widespread acceptance of Eugenics, if 
not as a practical policy for immediate 
application, at any rate as a proposition 
worthy of serious discussion is due almost 
entirely to the influence of Sir Francis Galton. 
Therefore, in order to show that his proposals 
were the fruit of an exceptionally ripe and 
varied experience, it seemed desirable to 
preface an account of the agencies now at 
work for the spread of the idea, by a short 
summary of his ancestry and life with an 
outline sketch of his work and character. 
The development of the Galton Laboratory 
for Eugenics at the London University is 
next described as the only establishment in 
this country devoted to the carrying out of 
statistical researches on the subject. After 
some mention has been made of the Eugenics 
Education Society, The American Breeders’ 
Association is dealt with in relation to its 
work on Eugenics. The objects of the Inter- 
national Association for Race Hygiene next 
receive attention, and finally the establish- 
ment of a Eugenics department at the Solvay 
Institute for sociology at Brussels is referred to.

CHAPTER IV 
EVOLUTION AND EUGENICS 
Herepiry finds its commonest outward 
expression in the fact that characters or 
qualities observed in the parents frequently 
occur also in the children. In everyday 
language the child is said to take after his 
mother or his father. He sometimes also 
takes after his grandmothers or grandfathers, 
or even after relations of more remote degree 
in his direct ancestry. In some respects he 
may favour (to use another colloquialism) 
some uncle or aunt or other collateral, and 
the resemblance may be either general or 
particular. It cannot be too emphatically 
asserted that what is observed is not the 
inheritance of particular characters,! but the 
similarity in respect to them of two individuals 
belonging to the same family. Heredity is 
the hypothesis put forward to explain this 
similarity, or, to speak more precisely, to 
label it as a particular instance of general 
law. 
The scientific study of heredity appears to 
turn about two problems, one descriptive 
and the other physiological. We want an 
1 The word character is here used in a technical sense, 
denoting qualities or characteristics, mental and physical.
-P-A-G-E-62
  58 EUGENICS 
accurate and precise account of the facts— 
what characters are inherited, and to what 
degree and in what way they are inherited; 
and we want to find out the nature of the 
underlying mechanism. It is obvious that 
these two problems are in reality so closely 
connected as to be practically one. For a 
knowledge of the facts is the only guide to 
the mechanism, while an understanding of 
the mechanism more than anything else 
would help one clearly to realise the facts. 
Of the many theories which have been put 
forward as to the essential mechanism of 
heredity, one only has stood the test of time, 
and this is held by practically all biologists 
at the present time. This is the theory of 
the ‘continuity of the germplasm’ propounded 
by August Weismann about thirty years 
ago. When it is said that Weismann’s 
hypothesis is almost universally accepted at 
the present day, its broad outline is referred 
to, and not the elaborate detail with which 
the outline was originally filled in. The 
detail need not here be described, but a 
knowledge of the essentials is indispensable 
to a thorough study of Eugenics. 
The ‘germplasm’ is the material out of 
which the germs are made, the germs them- 
selves being the elements which under suit- 
able conditions grow and develop into the 
adult animal or plant. It is the nature of 
the germplasm which determines what kind 
 
-P-A-G-E-63
  EUGENICS 59 
of animal or plant shall spring from the 
germs, not only in respect to those broader 
differences which characterise the species 
and variety to which it belongs, but also to 
a large extent in respect to its individual 
characters. 
Now as each creature proceeds to develop 
by the growth and differentiation of that 
small mass of germplasm which apart from 
some provision of food and covering was its 
all at the first beginning of individual exist- 
ence, a portion of that same mass is set aside 
unchanged in quality though increasing in 
quantity. The particular function assigned 
to this reserve of material, which forms no 
true part of the body in which it lives and 
grows, is to provide the germs from which 
the succeeding generation shall spring. In 
the members of that next generation a similar 
process occurs, and thus it can truly be said 
that the germplasm is continuous from one 
generation to another. If it is the nature of 
the germplasm which determines the growth 
and development of the individual, and if 
the father, son, and grandson on the one 
hand, and the father’s father and father’s 
grandfather on the other, all spring from 
different portions of the same germplasm, 
then the similarity between them can be 
more readily understood than the differences. 
The fact that the reproduction of the more 
conspicuous of the animals, and to a lesser
-P-A-G-E-64
  60 EUGENICS 
degree of the plants, is largely sexual—that 
is to say, that the germplasm in each case is 
provided, one-half by the father and one- 
half by the mother, complicates, but does 
not alter the essential nature of the theory. 
In particular, it leads to the following infer- 
ence—that each portion of the body must 
be represented in duplicate in the germ- 
plasm, from which it follows, further, that 
characters represented potentially in the 
germplasm need not be developed in the 
actual body. 
It will be as well to introduce here the word 
‘soma,’ borrowed from the Greek to denote 
the body contrasted with the germplasm. 
From it is derived the expression ‘somatic 
characters,’ denoting the actual characters of 
the body, when it is necessary to distinguish 
clearly between them and the characters 
existing potentially in the germplasm. The 
latter may be called the gametic characters, 
a term the meaning of which will be explained 
later. We have at present no knowledge of 
their real nature. We cannot tell whether 
it is a difference of chemical constitution, of 
the architecture and arrangement of the com- 
ponent parts, or of their motions relative to 
one another which. decides that one micro- 
scopic fragment of germplasm shall unfold 
into a small mouse with white hair, pink eyes, 
and the habit of running round after its tail, 
and another into a tall senior wrangler.
-P-A-G-E-65
  
EUGENICS 61 
Such knowledge is necessary to the com- 
plete understanding of heredity; it is not 
essential to the acceptance of the theory of 
the continuity of the germplasm. The 
importance of this theory to the biologist 
consists not only in the simplicity of the 
explanation which it affords of some of the 
phenomena of heredity, but also in its bearing 
on the two principal hypotheses which have 
been put forward to account for the now 
generally admitted fact of organic evolution. 
At the present day hardly any one doubts that 
all the complex forms of life which we know, 
in their infinite variety, have arisen gradually 
from very simple beginnings, or that this pro- 
gress which we call evolution is due in part at 
any rate to the operation of natural laws, with- 
out the interference of any miracle; what these 
natural laws are, and how they have operated, 
the framers of the two hypotheses referred 
to above have endeavoured to set forth. 
A study of evolution in the past would 
obviously assist those who desire in some 
small way to regulate it in the future. 
It is thus desirable to examine briefly the 
chief explanations which have been offered. 
The first of these, in point of time, was pro- 
pounded by Lamarck. 
Jean Baptiste de Lamarck! was born in 
1 The account of Lamarck and his views has been largely 
taken from Morgan’s Evolution and Adaptation and from 
Weismann’s Evolution Theory.
-P-A-G-E-66
  
  62 EUGENICS 
Picardy in the year 1744. He was first a 
soldier, secondly a botanist, and thirdly a 
zoologist. As a botanist he published a flora 
of France, as a zoologist he defined and named 
the great division of the animal kingdom 
called Vertebrates (animals with backbones). 
His theory of Evolution was given full 
utterance to in the Philosophie Zoologique, 
which he brought out in the year 1809. It 
consists essentially of four propositions. 
First, that the simplest organisms were 
produced in the past, and are constantly 
being produced in suitable localities and 
under suitable conditions by the process of 
spontaneous generation. At the present day 
an overwhelming majority of biologists con- 
sider it proved that unorganised matter does 
not spontaneously change into living beings. 
They accept the dictum ‘omne vivum e vivo’— 
that every living thing is produced by another 
living thing, though they concede the possi- 
bility postulated by a thorough-going accept- 
ance of the theory of Evolution that in 
primeval times when the physical conditions 
- of the earth were very different from what 
they are now, living matter may have been 
evolved gradually from inorganic beginnings. 
His second proposition is that the direct 
action of a changing environment has pro- 
duced lower animals and plants of diverse 
forms, from the simple organisms arising 
in the manner described above. This is a
-P-A-G-E-67
  EUGENICS 63 
purely formal explanation, it does not help 
one in any way to mmderstand the facts. 
Thirdly, that among the higher animals 
the diverse forms and structures have been 
caused indirectly by changes in their sur- 
roundings according to the following ‘laws’:— 
(1.) ‘In every animal that has not passed 
beyond the term of its development, the 
frequent and sustained use of an organ 
strengthens it, develops it, increases its size, 
and gives it strength proportionate to the 
length of time of its employment. On the 
other hand, continued lack of use of the same 
organ sensibly weakens it; it deteriorates, 
and its faculties diminish progressively until 
at last it disappears. 
(u.) ‘Nature preserves everything that she 
has caused the individual to acquire or to 
lose by the influence of the circumstances to 
which the race has for a long time been 
exposed, and consequently by the influence 
of the predominant use of certain organs 
(or in consequence of continued disuse). 
She does this by the generation of new indi- 
viduals which are produced with the newly 
acquired organs. This occurs provided that 
the acquired changes were common to the 
two sexes and to the individuals that pro- 
duced the new forms.’ 
The essential propositions of this third 
division of the theory may then be briefly 
stated in the following manner:—Changes
-P-A-G-E-68
    64 EUGENICS 
in the animal’s surroundings are responded 
to by changes in its habits. Any par- 
ticular habit involves the regular use of 
some organs and the disuse of others. Those 
organs which are used will be developed 
and strengthened, those not used diminished 
and weakened, and the changes so pro- 
duced will be transmitted to the offspring, 
and thus progressive development of par- 
ticular organs will go on from generation 
to generation. 
As examples of the action of these supposed 
laws, Lamarck instances the long legs, long 
necks, and long bills of wading birds, such as 
herons and storks, acquired gradually by the 
practice of wading first in shallow and then 
in deeper and deeper waters in their search for 
fish. A terrestrial parallel is provided by the 
giraffe, who feeds on the foliage of trees and, 
by continually stretching upwards to seize 
and devour it, has succeeded in lengthening 
his forelegs and almost more conspicuously 
his neck, so that now he can browse on lofty 
branches without discomfort. As examples 
of the way in which organs may degenerate 
through want of exercise continued through 
many generations, we have the loss of legs 
in the snake, brought about by its habit of 
wriggling through the grass, and the loss of 
teeth in the whale, incurred after it gave up 
a fish diet and took to bolting myriads of 
minute animals without masticating them.
-P-A-G-E-69
EUGENICS 65 
The most notable exponent of Lamarck’s 
theory in a modified form was Herbert 
Spencer, and some of the questions which it in- 
volves were debated with great vigour by him 
and his principal opponent, August Weismann. 
The chief objection to the theory is that if 
the effects of the environment on the indi- 
vidual, such as the special development of 
organs from sustained use, are in fact trans- 
mitted to the offspring in the ordinary course, 
it ought to be easy to obtain direct evidence 
of it, yet when one comes to inquire one finds 
that evidence is wanting. The theory of the 
continuity of the germplasm is opposed to the 
Lamarckian view, because it is difficult to 
conceive how by stretching his neck the 
ancestral giraffe could have so affected the 
germplasm as to produce a longer neck in 
his offspring, if one remembers that it was 
separated out and put in reserve long before 
he took to vegetable food, and even before 
he had designs on his mother’s udders. 
The theory of natural selection now to be 
described affords a much more easily under- 
stood interpretation of the giraffe’s neck or 
any other adaptation to the environment than 
does that of Lamarck. The two are not, 
however, necessarily in antagonism. Darwin 
himself believed that the effects of use and 
disuse might be inherited, and even in expres- 
sing his conviction that natural selection has 
been the most important factor in evolution,
-P-A-G-E-70
  66 EUGENICS 
clearly indicates his belief that it was not the 
only one. The theory of natural selection 
was enunciated by Darwin and by Alfred 
Russel Wallace at the same time in papers 
read before the Linnean Society on July 1, 
1858, and was stated more fully by the former 
in the Origin of Species, which appeared first 
in 1859. In the historical sketch which forms 
an introduction to this work, its author gives 
credit to Dr Wells for having enunciated the 
principle as early as 1818. Dr Wells did not, 
however, see in it a possible cause of Evolu- 
tion, but merely a hypothesis to account for 
some of the characteristics of the different 
varieties of mankind. The theory of natural 
selection is so well known that an account of 
it may seem superfluous, but it is often mis- 
understood, and to many is known only by 
name; thus for the sake of completeness it 
will be stated here as briefly as possible. 
All animals and plants reproduce their 
kind at such a rate that if nothing occurred to 
check their multiplication the offspring of 
a single pair could in a limited time cover 
the face of the earth. Thus the elephant is 
the slowest breeder of all animals, but in 
740 or 750 years a single pair of elephants 
might produce nineteen million descendants, 
while it has been calculated that in less than 
this period a single pair of house-flies could 
give rise to-a mass of descendants many times 
the size of the earth. A taste for tapes 
 
-P-A-G-E-71
EUGENICS 67 
assisted by a table of logarithms would 
enable any one who knew the elementary 
facts about the breeding habits of a few 
particular species to obtain many such sensa- 
tional results, but better evidence is forth- 
coming concerning the rapidity with which 
plants or animals may multiply under favour- 
able conditions. For example, in England 
the rabbit barely succeeds in maintaining its 
numbers, yet when a few specimens were 
introduced into Australia in a very short 
space of time their progeny became so 
numerous as to be a serious plague. 
From a consideration of these facts it 
follows that under normal conditions not all 
these individual animals and plants which 
come into existence reproduce their kind. 
In many cases the proportion of those who do 
so is a very small one. What then are the 
circumstances which prevent the remainder 
from so doing? It is unnecessary to answer 
this question in great detail, and it would be 
impossible, for the answer would be different 
in each particular case; but one may say 
generally with regard to wild animals, in the 
first place, that they may fall a prey to others 
which live on them; secondly, they may not 
be able to withstand climatic conditions, such 
as the severity of the winter or the heat and 
droughts of the summer; thirdly, in times of 
scarcity there may not be enough food to 
support the life of all, and many may starve.

The life of each is a continuous latruetes 
though often an unconscious one. © Indi- 
viduals compete with individuals, | whether 
of the same or of a different species, and social 
groups conflict with other social groups, and 
species with species, while each and all must 
protect themselves against the attacks of 
inanimate nature. ‘This baldly stated is 
what is meant by the ‘struggle for existence.’ 
Plants, no less than animals, feel its effects, 
for only those which can provide themselves 
with the necessary food and are able to main- 
tain life through any conditions which occur 
can have any chance of reproduction. 
That a struggle for existence of such a kind 
as has been described is one of the facts of 
life in wild nature can hardly be disputed, 
and, granting that variation occurs, it is not 
easy to dispute that those who do succeed in 
producing offspring must be on the whole the 
better adapted in structure and habits to 
the circumstances under which they live. 
Thus it results that the ‘struggle for exist- 
ence’ leads to the ‘survival of the fittest.’ 
At this point a word or two must be said 
about the variation postulated. Variation 
means the appearance in a species of individual 
differences—‘the many slight differences which 
appear in the offspring from the same parents, 
or which it may be presumed have thus arisen, 
from being observed in the individuals of 
the same species inhabiting the same confined
-P-A-G-E-73
  EUGENICS 69 
locality, may be called individual differences."? 
‘We see indefinite variability in the endless 
slight peculiarities which distinguish the indi- 
viduals of the same species, and which cannot 
be accounted for from inheritance from either 
parent or from some remote ancestor.’? 
The theory of natural selection offers no 
explanation of the cause of. variability, it 
merely presupposes that there are differences 
such as those referred to in the quotations 
given above. If one admits this, which 
eannot be denied, one may further admit 
that some will be of advantage to their pos- 
sessors in adapting them to the conditions 
under which they live and other disadvan- 
tageous. It then follows that the individuals 
whose peculiarities are of the former kind 
will be better adapted to their environment, 
better able to obtain food, to protect them- 
selves from heat and cold, or from the assaults 
of their enemies. Where the competition is 
keen and none can rely on another’s assistance, 
it needs little imagination to see that these 
will be far more likely to arrive at maturity, 
to take a mate and to leave a numerous pro- 
geny, than those who are less well adapted. 
The next proposition to be considered is 
that. some individual differences are in- 
herited. This also can hardly be controverted, 
nor that among the inherited differences will 
be many that are of an advantageous nature; 
1 Origin of Species, Chapter II. * Jbid., Chapter I.

    70 EUGENICS | 
if this is the case, and if each generation is 
derived rather more from the better than 
from the worse qualified members of the pre- ~ 
ceding generation, it follows that successive 
generations will become on the whole better 
and better adapted to their conditions of 
life, though this adaptation may be along 
divergent lines. 
Let us return again to the contemplation 
of the giraffe. To understand how its peculiar 
form may be attributed to natural selection 
it is necessary to form some sort of mental 
image of the conditions under which its 
ancestors lived. They were vegetarians, and 
thus required a large volume of food. We 
can picture them living on grassy plains 
dotted with a few trees and shrubs. There 
would have been other animals about, some 
of them may have specialised in the art 
of eating grass, while others may have bared 
all such shrubs which were not themselves 
adapted to withstand such depredation. We 
must suppose that there was not enough food 
for all, and that the majority were in an | 
almost constant state of hunger; but that | 
some, by being longer and stronger in the 
neck than their brothers, were able to reach 
up among the lower branches of the trees, 
and from time to time eat their fill. Superior 
vitality, derived from the enjoyment of a 
relatively ample diet, would have given the 
long-necked ones a slight advantage over
-P-A-G-E-75
  EUGENICS 71 
the rest. In times of famine they would have 
been the last to starve; in fighting for a 
mate, the advantage would have been theirs; 
in flight from a carnivorous foe, theirs would 
have been the better chance of escape.? 
Thus their progeny would have been more 
numerous than that of the rest, and, granted 
that the long, strong neck was inherited, 
would also have had longer and stronger 
necks. The same process repeated indefi- 
nitely would have caused the average length 
of neck gradually to increase until a point 
was reached at which any further increase 
would either have conferred no additional 
advantage or would have been incompatible 
in some way with the general economy of 
the body. 
This explanatory instance has been pur- 
posely described in a very crude way, the 
conditions of life being pictured as being far 
less complex than they really must have 
been. A complete description would be 
less easy to follow but more convincing. 
In this instance the Darwinian explanation 
may seem less direct and less probable than 
the Lamarckian; it is, however, unquestion- 
ably more in accord with the facts of heredity, 
1It may occur to some to remark that a fat well-fed 
animal does not run as well as a lean one in good con- 
dition; to them I would answer that animals in a wild 
and unprotected state are always compelled to take 
sufficient exercise, and that food is never so abundant as 
to allow of habitual excess.
-P-A-G-E-76
  72 EUGENICS 
as we know them, and is perfectiy in accord 
with the doctrine of the continuity of, the 
germplasm. For it does not presuppose 
that changes produced in the soma by the 
action of the environment so alter the germ- 
plasm that similar somatic changes are more 
likely to occur in the next generation, but 
rather that the variations on which natural 
selection works are themselves produced in 
the first instance by variations in the germ- 
plasm and thus ex hypothesi inherited. 
The question of the origin of variations in 
the germplasm is an interesting and per- 
plexing one. Dr Archdall Reid has made the 
ingenious suggestion that here also the work- 
ings of natural selection may be detected, 
for the possession of a variable germplasm 
would be in itself an advantage to a stock, 
if not to an individual, in that it would allow 
selective adaptation to occur. But although 
this idea may show how variability may be 
developed it does not really explain how it 
arose in the first instance. It would seem 
probable that the direct action of environ- 
ment must have been the operative cause 
both of general variability and sometimes also 
of specific changes which may manifest 
themselves by the appearance of certain 
somatic modifications in the offspring. 
Darwin believed that Evolution through 
natural selection was brought about by the 
accumulation of small variations of the kind
-P-A-G-E-77
EUGENICS 73 
that are constantly occurring. He recognised 
the appearance from time to time of ‘mons- 
trosities,’ that is to say, individuals who 
differed in some respect markedly from all 
their fellows, but was of opinion that even if 
the difference exhibited were highly advan- 
tageous, although it might at first be pre- 
served, ‘it would generally be lost by subse- 
quent intercrossing with ordinary individuals.’ 
At the present day a school of considerable 
importance holds a different view. They 
recognise two kinds of variations. The 
small individual differences, the occurrence 
of which is called ‘fluctuating variability,’ 
and the larger differences, corresponding to 
some extent to Darwin’s ‘monstrosities,’ 
which are called ‘mutations,’ though it is 
admitted that mutations need not neces- 
sarily be of a conspicuous kind. The inherit- 
ance of the former is denied, but the Mendelian 
theory, which will be described later, suggests 
the means by which a mutation occurring in 
a single individual may be transmitted with- 
out being swamped by intercrossing, and if 
of conspicuous advantage may spread rapidly 
through a population. 
The principle of natural selection is equally 
acceptable whatever view may be taken of 
the nature of the characters selected; it acts 
invariably by establishing a differential birth- 
rate which brings about a relative increase 
of individuals possessing certain qualities. 
E. D
-P-A-G-E-78
  74 EUGENICS 
The differential birth-rate may in itself be 
due to differentiation either of the death- 
rate or of the marriage-rate. The latter in 
its turn may be due to a special form of 
selection called ‘sexual selection.’ Darwin 
describes sexual selection in the following 
words: ‘This form of selection depends 
not on a struggle for existence in relation to 
other organic beings or to external condi- 
tions, but on a struggle between the individuals 
of one sex, generally the males, for the pos- 
session of the other sex. The result is not 
death to the unsuccessful competitor, but few 
or no offspring. Sexual selection is, therefore, 
less rigorous than natural selection. Gener- 
ally, the most vigorous males, those which 
are best fitted for their places in nature, will 
leave most progeny. But in many cases, 
victory depends not so much on general 
vigour, as on having special weapons confined 
to the male sex. A hornless stag or a spurless 
cock would have a poor chance of leaving 
numerous offspring. Sexual selection, by 
always allowing the victor to breed, might 
surely give indomitable courage, length to 
the spur, and strength in the wing to strike 
in the spurred leg, in nearly the same manner 
as does the brutal cock-fighter by the careful 
selection of his best cocks.’ 
Competition for a mate does not necessarily 
take the form of trial by combat. The 
1 Origin of Species, Chapter IV.
-P-A-G-E-79
  EUGENICS 75 
conscious or unconscious preference of the 
female for males in whom certain characters 
are especially developed would tend to further 
their propagation. And males also may 
exhibit and act on preferences for certain 
classes of females. 
The influence of sexual selection in man- 
kind at the present day would form an inter- 
esting study in Eugenics, and one which 
might be of practical importance. Sexual 
selection, guided by the eugenic ideal rather 
than by sordid desires, would seem the 
surest way of effecting racial improvement. 
No more need now be said on this point, for 
the theme will be more fully developed in 
a subsequent chapter. 
Variation is shown not only in structure 
but also in habits and instincts. Where 
these are of a suitable character they may be 
as conducive to success as any structural 
peculiarity. The advantages derived by 
those who act on the maxim that ‘union is 
strength’ have thus led to the evolution of 
gregarious animals, who form social groups 
for mutual protection. These may compete 
with other social groups, with the result 
that good organisation, rather than the 
strength or cunning of all the individuals 
composing it, becomes the determining factor 
in selection. A successful group increases in 
ize and spreads, it becomes split up into 
ompetitive sub-groups, which may again      
    
    
      
   
    
   
-P-A-G-E-80
  76 EUGENICS 
fuse and again subdivide, while in each 
division competition among individuals may 
go on continually. 
The gregarious habit leads to the develop- 
ment of certain qualities of mind which con- 
duce to the smooth working of social life. 
These manifest themselves in the protection 
of individuals who are unable to protect 
themselves. In man the struggle for existence 
among the members of civilised societies in 
so far as it implies competition for the neces- 
saries of life has almost stopped. Society 
provides food, shelter, and clothes for all 
who want them. Qualities such as vigour of 
body and mind may give a particularly 
favourable chance of reproduction to their 
possessors, but the opportunities for those 
who are relatively lacking in these qualities 
are almost equally favourable, and are more 
fully seized by them, owing, maybe, to their 
deficiency in thrift, foresight, and self-control. 
This state of affairs is regarded by some as 
a cessation of natural selection, and by others 
as natural selection grown harmful. It is 
immaterial which view we take. What has 
happened is this: that in so far as the social 
habits and the progress of the arts which 
depend on them have succeeded in adapting 
the environment to man, natural selection 
being altogether a slower and more wasteful 
process is no longer operating to adapt man 
to his environment.
-P-A-G-E-81
  EUGENICS V7 
Enough has been said to describe the 
essential features of the Lamarckian and 
Darwinian theories of evolution. 
From the point of view of the humanitarian, 
their particular interest lies in theiz relevance 
to the consideration of the forces able to 
mould society at the present day. The idea 
of Eugenics arises almost as a necessity from 
the theory of Evolution by Natural Selection. 
If we recognise that Selection has led to such 
’ great changes in the past, we must believe 
it can do so in the future. Having realised 
this, it should be our endeavour consciously 
to control it so that the changes produced 
will be to our benefit. In so far as we do so 
we shall replace Natural Selection by an 
artificial selection, and some see a danger 
in this. They argue that Natural Selection 
leads to the survival and consequent multipli- 
cation of the fittest, and thus conducing to 
desirable results should not be interfered with. 
The fallacy in this position has been exposed 
again and again. It lies in the fact that in 
this type of argument the word ‘fit’ is used 
in ‘two different senses.1_ When one says that 
Natural Selection is the survival of the fittest, 
one means merely that those who survive 
are the fittest to survive; that they are 
adapted to their environment, or their 
environment is adapted to them in such a 
1 Among others, Mr Balfour, in speaking at the Banquet 
of the International Eugenics Congress, pointed this out.
-P-A-G-E-82
  78 EUGENICS 
way that they have and use the chance of 
increasing and multiplying. This is the true 
meaning of the word fitness when it is used in 
discussing the theory of Natural Selection. 
But in ordinary language the word has quite 
a different significance: it means in good 
condition or of good quality, physical and 
mental, as a continued effect of nature and 
training; it suggests a sort of biological ideal 
of what a man should be. Now, Eugenists 
want to increase the numbers of those who 
are fit in the latter sense, but they do not think 
that Natural Selection as it works amongst 
mankind at the present day is likely always 
to help them, since the fit in the former sense 
may include many undesirable types, there- 
fore they urge the introduction of artificial 
selection, where it is practicable under 
‘existing conditions of law and sentiment.’ 
Other groups which desire and are working 
for the same ultimate object, base their 
efforts on the Lamarckian rather than on the 
Darwinian theory of Evolution. They believe 
that progressive improvement in human life 
may be rendered possible simply by improving 
the conditions of life. Perhaps those who 
hold these views should also be called 
EKugenists. They would then have to be 
labelled as Lamarckian Eugenists to distin- 
guish them from the Darwinian Eugenists, of 
whom Sir Francis Galton, the founder of the 
Science, was one.
-P-A-G-E-83
  EUGENICS 719 
Though the majority of persons who give 
the subject a thought attribute the wide 
variety of habit and structure exhibited by 
animals and plants to the work of evolution, 
it is probable that the old and highly respect- 
able theory of ‘special creation’ still survives. 
It has the merit of being so simple as to re- 
quire no thought or knowledge for its under- 
standing, and so devoid of any basis of reason 
as to be quite unassailable by argument. 
It is true that a series of fossil organisms 
gradually increasing in complexity are found 
as one explores first the older and deeper 
strata then those more shallow and more 
recent; it may be urged that this would 
appear to conflict with the notion that in 
a certain week of the year 4004 B.c. all the 
myriad species which we now recognise were 
established in the present form by the 
creative act of the Deity, but the thorough- 
going creationist has two alternative answers 
ready to meet any objections raised on these 
or similar grounds. First, ‘when God made 
the rocks He made the fossils also.’ Secondly, 
‘the devil made the fossils in order to tempt 
mankind into propounding and believing in 
the heretical and soul-destroying fallacy of 
Evolution.’ 
In recent years churchmen have for the 
most part frankly accepted the teachings of 
science, and Evolution is no longer a ground 
of conflict between science and religion; but
-P-A-G-E-84
    80 EUGENICS 
the special creation theory still appears to 
linger on. In particular, it is implied in the 
view that all babies are equal by nature at 
birth, and only become different subsequently 
owing to the action on them of different 
environments. This is a view on which many 
social reformers appear to act, but it is incom- 
patible with the acceptance of any theory 
of Evolution. 
SUMMARY OF CHAPTER 
The theory of the ‘continuity of the germ- 
plasm’ is now generally accepted as a general 
description of the mechanism by which the 
resemblances shown by members of the same 
family to one another, in so far as they are 
due to inheritance, are brought about. In 
the case of sexual reproduction, each indi- 
vidual receives a portion of germplasm from 
his father and another portion from his 
mother. All the characters of body or mind 
which he develops during his life are deter- 
mined partly by the nature of this germ- 
plasm and partly by the action of the environ- 
ment. Very early in the life of the individual 
a portion of it is set aside, and takes no part 
in the building up of the body. It increases 
by growth, and is divided up and stored in 
sexual cells, from which in turn fresh indi- 
viduals of the next generation are produced. 
Thus each individual springs from the germ- 
plasms which gave rise to its father and
-P-A-G-E-85
  EUGENICS ~ 81 
mother, and as the germplasm must be the 
principal factor in determining the characters 
of the body, it follows that children must 
tend to resemble their parents, brothers and 
sisters, and other relatives, since they are 
derived to a greater or less extent from the 
same germplasm. 
Theories of organic evolution endeavour to 
explain how by the operation of natural laws 
the countless forms of life, with all their 
individual complexity, may have been evolved 
from something comparatively simple. There 
are two principal theories of Evolution. The 
earlier is that of Lamarck, which attributes it 
largely to the inheritance of the effects of 
the use or disuse of certain organs or modifi- 
cations of the body produced by the direct 
action of the environment. The Theory of 
Natural Selection by the survival of the 
forms better adapted to their surroundings in 
the struggle for existence, propounded by 
Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace, 
is the other. The facts of heredity as we know 
them are more in accordance with the latter 
than the former. So is the theory of the 
continuity of the germplasm. It would be 
quite conceivable that the inheritance of 
the effects of use and disuse should have 
aided Natural Selection, but the evidence 
available hardly favours this view. On 
the other hand, there is a very strong 
probability that Natural Selection is one
-P-A-G-E-86
  82 . EUGENICS 
of the causes of Evolution, if not its only 
cause. 
Any endeavour to improve progressively 
the mental and physical qualities of man- 
kind must, consciously or unconsciously, 
model itself on some theory of Evolution. 
Those who would strive to do this merely by 
the improvement of the environment try to 
establish a parallel to the process described 
by Lamarck. They may be called Lamarckian 
Eugenists. Those who, following Sir Francis 
Galton, rely on the exercise of conscious 
selection applied by any means practicable 
under existing conditions may justify their 
view by an appeal to Natural Selection. 
Others, again, make no endeavour to effect 
a progressive improvement, but believing that 
the species is immutable, aim only at making 
the circumstances as favourable as possible 
for the development of the immediate 
generation. These have no biological basis 
on which to work but the theory of Special 
Creation. 
CHAPTER V 
MENDELISM 
Tue study of inheritance in recent years has 
been pursued vigorously along two different 
paths. First, by the statistical summarisation 
of the facts, a process introduced by Sir Francis 
 
-P-A-G-E-87
  EUGENICS 83 
Galton; and, secondly, by the experimental 
hybridisation of animals and plants. The 
latter method, when carried out on the lines 
laid down by Gregor Mendel, has alone led 
to some real understanding of the underlying 
physiological processes, and it appears 
capable of leading to more. 
Our consideration of heredity, the central 
problem in Eugenics from which all the 
others radiate, will therefore be initiated with 
an account of Mendel and his work. 
Gregor Johann Mendel was born in Austrian 
Silesia in 1822, the birth-year also of Sir 
Francis Galton. He entered the monastery 
at Altbriinn in 1848, but left it for a time to 
study physics and natural science at Vienna 
in 1851-8. For a time he taught in the school 
at Briinn, but afterwards became abbot of 
the monastery. He died in 1884. 
His papers on plant hybridisation, which 
form the basis of the science of Genetics, 
were read before the meetings of the Brinn 
Naturalists’ Society in 1865 (the year in which 
Galton first expressed his views on Eugenics), 
and published in their journal. They were 
neglected till 1900, when they were inde- 
pendently discovered, and the experiments 
repeated by Correns, Tchermak, and De 
Vries. 
Mendel selected pea plants for hybridisation 
for two reasons: first, that the different 
varieties have constant distinctive characters; 
 
-P-A-G-E-88
  84 EUGENICS 
and, secondly, that it is comparatively easy to 
ensure that no other pollen but that desired 
by the experimenter shall be used for fertilis- 
ing them. It is not necessary to give a com- 
plete description of his experiments, for the 
principles ascertained from them can be 
clearly understood by studying one or two. 
As an example may be taken, the crossing of 
a tall variety of pea in which the plants 
grow normally to a height of six feet with 
a dwarf variety averaging about 14 feet in 
height. As it is necessary to be able to refer 
definitely to each generation produced in an 
experiment of this kind, a simple nomen- 
clature has been devised for the purpose. 
The original pairs, are called the parental 
generation, abbreviated into P. The plants 
which are raised from the seeds which they 
set, are the first filial generation, F,; the seeds - 
of the F, generation grow into the plants of 
the second. filial generation, F,, and so on. 
In this case all the plants of the F, genera- 
tion were tall, in spite of the fact that one of 
the parents was a dwarf; there were no 
intermediate forms.  Self-fertilisation was 
allowed to occur, the ovules of each flower 
being fertilised by its own pollen, and seeds 
were set. These in turn were planted and 
grew up into the F, generation. Plants were 
thus raised, of which 787 were tall and 277 
dwarfs. Thus dwarf plants which disappeared 
in the F, generation reappeared again in
-P-A-G-E-89
  EUGENICS 85 
about a quarter of the plants of the F, 
generation, and in experiments in which 
different pairs of characters were crossed the 
same thing happened. The proportions 
varied slightly, sometimes being a little more 
than three of the one kind to one of the other, 
sometimes a little less, as would naturally 
occur if the plants actually grown were 
samples chosen at random from a very large 
number in which the two forms were accu- 
rately mixed in the proportion of three to one. 
The dwarf plants which reappeared in the F, 
generation were again self-fertilised and bred 
true to that character through all succeeding 
generations; that is to say, their immediate 
descendants were all dwarfs, and tallness did 
not again reappear in the stock. Of the tall 
F,’s, one-third bred true to this character, 
giving rise when self-fertilised only to tall 
plants. That is to say, that two groups, each 
consisting of one quarter of the whole number 
of plants produced in this generation, of 
which one was tall and the other dwarf, 
bred as true to these characters as the strains 
which were crossed in the first instance. 
The other half were all tall, but when self- 
fertilised did not breed true but behaved like 
the plants of the F, generation, giving again 
one-quarter dwarf and three-quarters tall. 
As the latter character in the original cross 
seemed entirely to dominate the former, it 
was called the dominant character; while
-P-A-G-E-90
86 EUGENICS 
the former, which disappeared in F,, then 
reappeared in a quarter of the plants of F,, 
received the name of -recessive. All plants 
showing the recessive character bred true, 
but those with the dominant character were 
of two kinds, the one, the pure dominants 
breeding true, while the other, sometimes 
called impure dominants, behaved like the 
original hybrids. The whole process can be 
shown schematically much more clearly than 
it can be described in writing. Let T stand 
for tall plants which breed true, T(D) for 
tall plants which do not breed true, and D 
for the dwarfs. Let us suppose that one 
T is crossed with a D. Then the F, genera- 
tion will all be T(D). Let us take one of these 
and trace out what its descendants will be 
on the supposition that it is self-fertilised 
and sets four seeds, which grow into healthy 
plants, and that these and each plant of 
subsequent generations are also self-fertilised 
and set four seeds. Then the pedigree will 
be as follows :—

  EUGENICS 87 
Thus far we have merely endeavoured to 
describe what happens; it is now necessary 
to examine the explanation which has been 
offered of the facts. Mendel’s original inter- 
pretation will not be referred to, as another 
has been put forward in recent years, which 
is essentially the same in principle, is much 
more easy to understand, and accounts for 
a wider range of facts. 
In sexual reproduction, male and female 
contributions of different outward form, but 
equivalent as agents for inheritance, unite 
to form the zygote which by its growth and 
differentiation is converted into the adult 
animal or plant. The two elements which 
thus unite are called gametes, a word derived 
_from the Greek, and suggesting an analogy 
between the fusion of the gametes and 
marriage. The essential part of the gametes 
is the germplasm. 
To turn from these definitions to the con- 
erete instance of the tall and dwarf peas. 
The theory supposes that tallness is repre- 
sented in all the gametes produced by a true 
breeding pea which displays it, by a single 
indivisible factor. It is not necessary in 
order to understand the theory to have any 
idea what may be the ultimate nature of the 
factor. It is further supposed that dwart 
peas produce gametes in which this factor 
is invariably absent. Thus when a fresh 
zygote is formed by breeding together any
-P-A-G-E-92
  88 EUGENICS 
two peas belonging to these two classes it 
may be of three different kinds. 
(1) The tallness factor may be included in 
the gametes of both parents, in which case 
the zygote may be called duplex! in respect 
to it, a word which is intended to signify 
that it contains the factor twice over. 
(2) The factor may be brought in only by 
one parent, in which case the zygote is called 
simplex. 
(8) Neither of the two gametes may con- 
tain it, and then the zygote is called 
nulliplex. 
In all cases of Mendelian inheritance, 
individuals which are duplex with regard to 
a particular factor display the character which 
is represented in the germplasm by that 
factor, and nulliplex individuals the char- 
acter which is developed in its absence. In 
the case we are considering, and in all cases 
in which the one character is dominant over 
the other, the presence of a single dose of the 
factor in the zygote is sufficient to bring about 
the development of the factorial character. 
It is thus displayed by all the simplex indi- 
viduals. In other cases there may be no 
dominance or incomplete dominance; in 
other words, simplex may be intermediate in 
1 These terms were introduced by Dr C. B. Davenport. 
According to the older poem ey both duplex and 
nulliplex forms are described as homozygotes, because 
similar gametes unite to form the zygote. Simplex forms 
are styled heterozygotes,
-P-A-G-E-93
  EUGENICS 89 
character between duplex and nulliplex, or 
be entirely different from either. 
Duplex individuals produce only gametes 
which contain the factor; in the gametes of 
the nulliplex it is invariably absent, while 
in one half the gametes of the simplex it is 
present and in the other half absent.1 Let us 
consider what happens in the event of self- 
fertilisation in a pea which is simplex with 
regard to the tallness factor. Let those of 
its gametes which have the factor be written 
T, and those which do not possess it ¢. For 
the present purpose we may regard the 
ovules and pollen grains as the male and 
female gametes. Then half the ovules and 
half the pollen grains will contain the tallness 
factor and half will not, and every 100 ovules 
fertilised will probably consist of 50 T and 
50 t. Each of these may be fertilised by a 
pollen grain T or a pollen grain ¢t. Thus, 
according to the law of probability, half the 
50 T ovules will be likely to be fertilised 
with T pollen grains and half with ¢ pollen 
grains, and the zygote formed from them 
may thus be written 25 TT+25Tt, similarly 
from the 50 ¢ ovules 25 tT zygotes+25 tt 
zygotes will be developed. 
The TT zygotes are duplex. The tT do 
not differ from the Tt, and are simplex, 
1The case would not be altered if, instead of self- 
fertilisation, fertilisation by another individual with the 
same gametic constitution took placa.
-P-A-G-E-94
  90 EUGENICS 
while the # are nulliplex. Therefore, accord- 
ing to the hypothesis, if two simplex indi- 
viduals are bred together, one half of the 
offspring will be simplex, one quarter duplex, 
and one quarter nulliplex. An enormous 
number of experiments performed on a large 
variety of animals and plants have shown 
that this actually occurs. Thus the theory 
does in reality provide an adequate explana- 
tion of facts of this kind. It may also be 
checked by slightly varying the experiments. 
To take an example from studies in inherit- 
ance of coat colour in mice. In this case 
the assumption is made that pigment is 
formed in the hair and eyes, if a pigment- 
producing factor is present in the zygote. 
When it is absent, no pigment is formed, 
and the mouse which lacks it is an albino 
with white hair and pink eyes. If the gametes 
containing the factor are written C, and those 
not containing it are written c, then the 
gametic constitution of an albino mouse is 
always cc, but that of a coloured mouse may 
be either cC or CC. The nulliplex cc when 
bred together will always produce albinos, 
and nothing but albinos, and the duplex CC 
produce nothing but coloured mice; but when 
the simplex cC are mated with one another, 
one quarter of the offspring are albinos. 
Very numerous experiments, including 
some performed by the present writer, have 
demonstrated the truth of the facts. Now
-P-A-G-E-95
  EUGENICS 91 
let us suppose that the simplex forms are 
bred with albinos instead of among them- 
selves, what will be the result? According 
to the theory, half the gametes of the simplex 
will be C and half c, whereas all the gametes 
of the albinos will be c; therefore, half the 
number of young mice produced ought to have 
a gametic constitution Ce, and the other half 
ce. All the former class should have coloured 
coats and dark eyes, and all the latter white 
coats and pink eyes, and this is what acutally 
occurs. 
, The most important of the Mendelian 
hypotheses are: firstly, that a character 
which is transmitted by inheritance without 
splitting up or being diluted or altered is 
represented in the gametes by one indivisible 
factor. The gamete either contains this 
factor or it does not contain it; it must either 
contain it whole and pure or be entirely free 
from it. This is the hypothesis of ‘gametic 
purity.’ The characters represented by single 
factors are called ‘unit characters.’ 
Secondly, of the gametes produced by a 
simplex individual, half will normally con- 
tain the factor and the other half will not 
contain it. 
Cytology, a science which deals with the 
structure and development of the innumer- 
able little masses of living matter which 
built together form the body, has almost 
brought this assumption into the realms of
-P-A-G-E-96
  92 EUGENICS 
observed fact. The significance of many 
complex processes, described with the aid 
of the microscope long before the Mendelian 
theory attracted any attention, was not 
fully appreciated till viewed in the light 
which it shed, while the theory itself pro- 
pounded before such observations were made 
has been in turn corroborated by them. 
Its principles, when once grasped, seem 
wonderfully simple; but in practical hybrid- - 
isation many complications arise which can 
only be unravelled by the use of a consider- 
able amount of ingenuity, coupled with train- 
ing and experience. How complexity may 
be introduced into the results may be readily 
understood by considering what happens 
when two varieties are crossed which differ 
not only in one character but in two or more. 
An example of this may be taken from 
Mendel’s experiments. The ripe dry pea, the 
seed of the pea plant, in some varieties is 
yellow in colour and in others green, in some 
it is smooth and round, and in others it has 
a shrivelled, wrinkled appearance. These 
characters of the seed are characters of the 
embryo plant which it contains. The colour 
of the two cotyledons or seed leaves, which 
form the greater part of the embryo, is seen 
through the more or Jess transparent seed 
coat which covers them, and their form, 
whether round or wrinkled, gives the form 
to the seed. Yellowness is due to the presence
-P-A-G-E-97
EUGENICS 93 
in the zygote of a factor which is absent in 
the green pea, and roundness is due to the 
presence of another factor which is absent 
in the wrinkled pea.t_ Peas in the condition 
in which one hopes to find them on the table 
are all round and green, whatever character 
they may assume when they are dry. The 
factor which determines yellowness does so 
by causing the original green pigment to 
fade, thus revealing yellow pigment which 
is also present; and that which enables the 
pea to keep its original roundness operates 
by converting the sugar, present in the moist 
condition of both varieties, into starch. Ths 
starch, by permanently retaining much more 
water than the sugar, prevents the wrinkling 
which is caused by the excessive loss of 
moisture in drying. 
If a round yellow pea is crossed with a 
green wrinkled one the F, generation will 
be all round and yellow. If R represents the 
factor for roundness and r its absence, and 
if Y represents the factor for yellowness and 
y its absence, the gametic constitution of 
the peas of this generation can be written 
Rr, Yy. When they grow into plants they 
may form gametes of four different kinds, 
for each may contain either R or r in con- 
junction with either Y or y. If self-fertilisa- 
tion takes place, each of these four different 
1 Vide Darbishire, Breeding and the Mendelian 
Discovery. 
 
-P-A-G-E-98
  94 EUGENICS 
kinds of gametes may unite either with another 
of the same kind, or with one of the three 
other kinds, and zygotes built up in sixteen 
different ways may thus be obtained. They 
are all equally likely to occur, and they can 
be represented as follows :— 
(1) RY.RY. (5) Ry.RY. (9) 7¥.RY. (18) ry.RY. 
(2) RY.Ry. (6) RyRy. (10) 7¥.Ry. (14) ry.Ry. 
(8) RY.#Y. (7) RyrY. (11) v¥.7Y. (15) ry.vY. 
(4) RY.ry. (8) Ry.ry. (12) r¥.ry. (16) ry-ry. 
Although the zygotes are formed in sixteen 
different ways, there are not in reality sixteen 
different gametic combinations, but only 
nine. 
If a diagonal line is drawn from the left- 
hand top corner of the figure to the right- 
hand bottom corner, it will cut through four 
combinations which occur each only once, 
namely—(1) RY RY, (6) Ry Ry, (11) vY ry, 
(16) ry ry. On the other hand, all the four 
combinations which lie on the other diagonal 
—namely, Nos. (4), (7), (10), and (13)—are 
in reality the same, each containing both 
R and Y andr and y. There are four other 
combinations which occur, each twice over— 
(2) and (5), (8) and (9), (8) and (14), and (12) 
and (15). But although there would in 
reality be nine different kinds of zygotes, 
only four different kinds of pea would be 
distinguishable by their external (somatic) 
characters, for the same character is developed
-P-A-G-E-99
  EUGENICS 95 
whether the factor is present either singly or 
doubly in the zygote. All those peas whose 
zygotes contained R would be round, and all 
those containing Y yellow. Nine of them— 
namely, Nos. (1), (2), (8), (4), (5), (7), (9), 
(10), (18)—contain both R and Y, and would, 
consequently, be both round and yellow. 
Three—namely, Nos. (11), (12), (15)—con- 
tain Y, but do not contain R, these would be 
yellow and wrinkled. Three—namely, Nos. 
(6), (8), and (14)—contain R, but not Y, and 
would be round and green, while one number 
(16) contains neither R nor Y, and would be 
wrinkled and green. 
Any one who wishes to understand these 
deductions from the Mendelian theory is 
recommended to provide himself (or herself) 
with an adequate supply of patience, a large 
sheet of paper and a pencil, and to figure out 
for himself.(or herself) how many different 
kinds of hybrids could be produced if one 
were to breed from varieties differing in 
three, four, five, or more unit characters. In 
each case, with regard to each factor, he can 
make the alternative assumptions that the 
simplex form displays somatic characters 
similar to that of the duplex, intermediate 
between duplex and nulliplex, or entirely 
different to either. The complexity of the 
results obtained will surprise and possibly 
confuse him. In actual experimental work 
further complications are introduced by the
-P-A-G-E-100
  96 EUGENICS 
fact that the different factors may exhibit 
mutual attractions or repulsions, so that two 
factors controlling the development of differ- 
ent somatic characters may always be, or 
never be, transmitted in the same gamete. 
Up to this point we have spoken as if the 
somatic character depended on one and only 
one gametic factor, but many characters 
which have been shown to be inherited in 
a Mendelian way depend on the presence or 
absence of two or more. One of the most 
interesting and economically important cases 
of this kind is that of the inheritance of 
fecundity, or the egg-laying faculty in poultry, 
which has recently been worked out by Dr 
Raymond Pearl, of the Maine Experiment 
Station, U.S.A. 
The problem which he has elucidated is 
a particularly difficult one, and many people 
have in consequence denied that fecundity 
is inherited. The denial was reiterated some 
months after the publication of Dr Pearl’s 
results by the writer of a special article on 
poultry-raising in the Times. Dr Pearl has 
discovered that the egg-laying capacity of 
hens depends on the presence or absence of 
three separate factors in the zygote, which 
are inherited in a simple Mendelian manner, 
except that there is repulsion between two of 
them, so that they are never present together 
in the same gamete. The egg-laying capacity 
is judged by the number of eggs laid in 
 
-P-A-G-E-101
  EUGENICS 97 
the winter months. Although this depends 
normally on environmental conditions, the 
disturbing influence of the latter can be 
practically eliminated in experiments per- 
formed by competent people on a well- 
equipped farm. The three factors are dis- 
tinguished by the letters F, L, and L,. When 
all three are present in the zygote the highest 
degree of fecundity is shown, which is found 
to correspond to a winter production of more 
than thirty eggs. When F and either L or L, 
are present together, one to thirty eggs are 
laid. A double dose of L, which may be 
present, does not produce any greater fecun- 
dity than a single dose. L, cannot be present 
twice over, because it is never transmitted 
in the same gamete as F. When F is present 
alone, the number is reduced to nothing; 
but when F is absent, although both L and 
L, may be present and transmitted to the 
next generation, no eggs are laid, for the fowl 
is not a hen but a cock. 
The ‘statement contained in the last sen- 
tence involves a theory which has been seized 
upon by some ‘feminist’ writers as a demon- 
stration of the essential superiority of women 
over men—namely, that femaleness depends 
on the presence of a factor (referred to as 
F in the above description) which is absent 
in the male. The feminist contention need 
hardly be answered seriously; but the theory 
itself is one of some importance, and helps BE B
-P-A-G-E-102
98 EUGENICS 
to explain, on Mendelian lines, instances of 
inheritance which would otherwise be difficult 
to understand. 
If femaleness is determined by the presence 
of an additional factor, one must suppose 
that the male is nulliplex, and produces only 
gametes which do not contain F, and that 
the female is invariably simplex, producing 
gametes of which about half contain it and 
the other half do not. As sexual reproduction 
necessitates that one gamete must be derived 
from the male and the other from the female, 
half the zygotes produced must be simplex 
and the other half nulliplex, and so about 
equal numbers of males and females are 
born. | 
The theory that sex itself is inherited on 
Mendelian lines in the manner thus described 
has been used by Dr Archdall Reid as an 
argument against attributing too much 
importance to Mendelism. His view, stated 
for brevity in a teleological form, is that 
Mendelian inheritance has been evolved solely 
for the purpose of keeping the sexes distinct, 
and preventing the blending of sexual 
characters, consequently that beyond th 
primary sexual characters only those whic 
are connected in some way with sex ar 
transmitted in a Mendelian way. Dr Reid’ 
suggestion can hardly be accepted, as it in 
volves a very unnatural straining of th 
limits of the class of characters associate     
   
    
                  
   
-P-A-G-E-103
  EUGENICS 99 
with sex; but it is useful in correcting the 
inference, sometimes rather too readily 
drawn, that because a large and increasing 
number of characters are known to be in- 
herited according to Mendel’s laws, therefore 
if the facts were before us it would be found 
that all are. But, although according to the 
views of the present writer the time for belief 
in the universal applicability of these laws is 
a long way off, it may be difficult to disprove 
that they control any individual case, for if 
a character depends on the presence in the 
zygote of a large number of factors, although 
each may be transmitted strictly in accord- 
ance with them, the combined result might 
be so complicated as to defy analysis. 
A case which may perhaps be taken as an 
instance of this possibility is the blending of 
human skin colour in inheritance. In crosses 
between negroes and white men, all inter- 
mediate shades between those characteristic 
of the two races appear to occur, and as 
a general rule the less negro blood is present 
the lighter is the colour. At first sight this 
would appear to be an undoubted example 
of non-Mendelian inheritance, but, in the 
light of what has been said above, it would 
be very unwise to assume this immediately, 
particularly as it has been found, now that 
a somewhat closer attention has been given 
to the facts, that white or negro babies are 
sometimes born to 'pake ee from whom they

would hardly be expected. Mendelism often 
provides a more charitable and more probable 
explanation of such phenomena than the 
suggestion of conjugal infidelity. 
At this point those readers who have not 
already given the chapter up may well ask, 
What has all this talk about peas and mice 
and fowls, or even unexpected negro babies, 
got to do with Eugenics? The answer is 
that Mendelism is capable of providing in 
some cases a surer guide to knowledge of 
probable characters in the offspring of con- 
templated human matings than any method 
yet suggested; further, that Mendelism can 
only be properly investigated by experi- 
mental breeding which cannot be performed 
on human beings. In so far as it applies 
to human beings it can only be studied by 
the examination of pedigrees interpreted 
with the aid of the knowledge derived from 
experiments. 
Several clear cases of Mendelian inheritance 
in man are now recognised, though the 
majority of them have little Eugenic signifi- 
cance. One of the clearest is the inheritance 
of eye-colour, which has been investigated 
by Major Hurst in England and Dr Davenport 
in America, to the former of whom the credit 
of priority belongs. Human eyes, except 
those of albinos, may be divided into two 
principal classes, the one containing the blue 
and gray, and the other the hazel, green,  
-P-A-G-E-105
EUGENICS 101 
brown and black and parti-coloured eyes. 
The anatomical distinction between the two 
groups is that in the former the pigment 
apparently colouring the iris is in reality 
confined to a layer which lies behind it. 
This layer is seen through the iris and appears 
clear blue, dullish blue or gray, according as 
to whether the substance of the iris itself is 
more or less transparent. 
In eyes of the other class there is, in addition, 
yellow or brown pigment in front, which, 
varying in quantity and arrangement, gives 
rise to large range of variety in the colour 
of eyes which are not either blue or 
gray. 
For simplicity, the two classes will be here 
referred to as ‘blue’ and ‘brown.’! The 
presence of the front pigment layer in the 
eye seems to depend on the presence in the 
zygote of a special factor. Whether this 
factor is introduced by one gamete or by 
both the result is the same. Thus persons 
with ‘brown’ eyes may be either duplex or 
simplex. The former produce only gametes 
containing the factor, and in the latter, 
1 Major Hurst gave them the more correct names of 
‘simplex’ and ‘duplex’—the blue having only a single 
layer of pigment and the brown two layers, The words 
simplex’ and ‘duplex’ were adopted by Dr Davenport, 
but used by him in an entirely different sense—namely, 
that in which they have been used in the present chapter. 
Persons nulliplex (according to Davenport) with regard 
to eye colour have simplex eyes, according to Hurst; 
while those who have Hurst’s duplex eyes may be duplex 
or simplex, according to Davenport. 
 
-P-A-G-E-106
102 EUGENICS 
half will contain it and the other half not. 
The former will only have brown-eyed 
children, whatever may be the colour of 
the eyes of their mates. Among the children 
of the latter, if mated among themselves, 
a quarter will have ‘blue’ eyes, and if mated 
with blue-eyed persons a half. ‘Blue’- 
eyed people are nulliplex, and produce no 
gametes containing the factor. The children 
of two ‘blue’-eyed parents are thus invariably 
“blue’-eyed. The theoretical explanation of 
these proportions given with reference to the 
description of the hybridisation experiments 
on peas and mice applies in exactly the same 
way here also. 
It will, of course, be noted that Mendelism 
provides a key to a small part only of the facts 
of inheritance in eye colour. An explanation 
which involves putting together in one class 
the large range of varieties, which are here 
ealled ‘brown,’ can hardly be claimed as 
complete, but one must not underestimate 
on that account the credit due to Major 
Hurst for being the first to see something 
that was before the eyes of all of us, nor the 
importance of the result in demonstrating 
that a normal human character may be 
inherited in a Mendelian way. 
The inheritance of eye colour may not 
appear to have a very direct or immediate 
bearing on Eugenics, but for the facts just 
described a parallel may be found in the  
-P-A-G-E-107
  EUGENICS 108 
inheritance of epilepsy and feeble-minded- 
ness, concerning the practical importance of 
which there can be no dispute. This will be 
discussed more fully in a later chapter. 
The majority of known instances of the 
Mendelian transmission in man of characters 
detrimental to their possessors, are compara- 
tively rare diseases and deformities. A case 
discussed fully by Professor Bateson! is that 
of Brachydactyly. Brachydactylous persons 
have very short fingers and toes, which are 
all two-jointed like thumbs, and not three- 
jointed like normal fingers and toes. The 
thumbs are also abnormally short, and so 
generally are the affected persons themselves. 
In families in which this condition occurs the 
males who exhibit it may be as much as 
84 inches shorter on the average than those 
who do not, and the females 43 inches. In 
these families the descendants of members 
who are free from the defect are invariably 
free from it; but when those who show it 
are mated with unaffected persons, about 
one-half of their offspring are brachydacty- 
lous, and the other half are not. These facts 
are explicable on the assumption that the 
abnormality is caused by the presence of 
a determining factor in the zygote. This is 
completely absent from normals, who there- 
fore produce only gametes without it. As 
in the families described abnormals were 
Mendel, Principles of Heredity, 1909.
-P-A-G-E-108
  104 EUGENICS — 
always mated with normals all the brachy- 
dactylous children born must be simplex. 
Half their gametes, therefore, would contain 
the factor, and the other half be free from it. 
Thus when they in turn were married to nor- 
mal persons, half their offspring would be 
simplex, showing brachydactyly, and the 
other half normal. 
It is clear that when facts like this about 
particular defects are known, their likelihood 
to occur in the offspring of individual matings 
may be prophesied with an accuracy which 
may amount to a practical certainty. In 
some cases persons born into a family in 
which a particular defect is present could be 
guaranteed to be not only entirely free from 
it in themselves, but to be no more likely to 
have affected children than any scion of the 
soundest stock. 
The importance of the bearing of Mendelian 
investigation in Eugenics need not be further 
insisted on, but we may have long to wait 
before it becomes a practical guide for the 
everyday use of persons contemplating 
matrimony. 
SUMMARY OF CHAPTER 
To illustrate the principles of Mendelism 
an account is given of Mendel’s experiment 
of hybridising a tall with a dwarf variety of 
pea. The first generation of hybrids (F,) 
 
-P-A-G-E-109
EUGENICS 105 
are all tall, but when they are self-fertilised 
a quarter of the members of the next genera- 
tion (F,) thus produced are dwarfs. 
The tall plants can be shown by breeding 
from them to be of two kinds, one producing 
on self-fertilisation only plants like them- 
selves, and the other behaving like the plants 
of the F, generation. A quarter of the plants 
of the F, generation belong to the former kind, 
and one-half to the latter. The explanation 
given to account for this is that of the two 
gametes which are brought together to form 
the zygote in the original cross one contains 
a factor, which when present in the zygote 
determines that it shall develop into a tall 
plant, and the other does not. The members 
of the F, generation containing the factor, 
though only introduced by one parent, are 
tall themselves, but produce gametes of 
which only one-half contain the factor. If 
self-fertilisation then occurs, or if the flowers 
are fertilised from plants of a similar nature, 
each gamete which contains the factor is 
just as likely to be fertilised by one of the 
same kind as one of a different kind. Conse- 
quently when a large number are fertilised, 
half will be fertilised by other gametes con- 
taining the factor and half by gametes which 
do not contain it, and the same applies if 
one considers the gametes which do not 
contain it. Suppose T to represent gametes 
containing the factor and ¢ those which do 
 
-P-A-G-E-110
    106 EUGENICS 
not contain it, then three different kinds of 
zygotes will be formed. TT, Ti, and #, and, 
according to the laws of probability, in every 
100 zygotes of the F, generation one may 
expect 25 TT, 50 Tt, and 25 #. TT and Tt 
will be ¢ad2 plants and tt dwarfs, TT and t# 
will breed true to the character shown, pro- 
ducing each gametes all of one kind; but Ti 
being of the same gametic constitution as the 
plants of the F, generation will behave like 
them and produce one-half T gametes and 
one-half t. 
It is then shown what kind of hybrids will 
be produced, and in what proportions, if 
the varieties crossed differ in two unit char- 
acters instead of in one; and to illustrate 
what may occur when a character really 
depends on the presence of two or more 
factors, Dr Raymond Pearl’s investiga- 
tions into the fecundity of fowls are con- 
sidered. 
The inheritance of human eye colour is 
taken as an instance of the transmission of 
normal human characters according to- 
Mendel’s Laws, the explanation given being 
that the presence of an additional factor in 
the zygote converts blue or gray eyes into 
hazel or brown, in the same way that a pea 
plant if it has the right factor present is 
tall; but when the factor is absent, a dwarf. 
Brachydactyly is taken as an instance of 
a human abnormality, conditioned by the
-P-A-G-E-111
  EUGENICS 107 
presence of a determining factor in the 
zygote, and inherited in the same way. The 
special importance of Mendelism to Eugenics 
is then pointed out. 
CHAPTER VI 
THE STATISTICAL STUDY OF 
INHERITANCE 
Waitt Mendelian investigation, or to speak 
rather more broadly, the science of Genetics, 
which has been evolved out of it, is, and 
promises to remain, the most fertile method 
of pursuing the study of inheritance, it is 
not the only one. Though its advance during 
the last twelve years has been one of sur- 
prising rapidity, it has up to the present 
left many fields unworked, and even if it 
may be expected to increase a hundredfold 
the knowledge which we owe to it, there is 
as yet no indication that its methods of 
analysis will ever be able to touch some of 
the problems of inheritance. They may fail 
for two reasons. First, there may be charac- 
ters which are not inherited according to 
Mendel’s laws; and, secondly, the somatic 
character may be determined by so large a 
number of gametic factors that, although 
each factor is transmitted unchanged in all 
its purity, the somatic character might

appear to be completely blended or modified 
in many other ways by inheritance. It is 
not.in any way in disagreement with Mendel’s 
theory to suppose that a character may 
depend for its full development on the 
presence of a hundred factors ; but if an indi- 
vidual bearing such a character were crossed 
with another which did not contain it, the 
number of hybrids with different gametic 
constitutions which might arise in the F, 
generation is so vast that their identification 
would be altogether outside the range of 
practical Genetics, at any rate at the present 
day; and it is only by the identification of 
the different hybrids produced that the 
number and nature of the factors can be 
arrived at. 
It is in such cases as this that statistical 
methods may be profitably applied to the 
study of inheritance. The aims of the statis- 
tician in approaching the problem are far 
less ambitious than those of the Geneticist. 
The former makes no endeavour to arrive at 
an understanding of the physiology of 
heredity—that is to say the workings of its 
vital mechanism; he tries only to arrive at 
a simple statement of its effects when 
observed in a large number of individuals. 
He attempts to measure the average resem- 
blance shown between parents and children, 
1Geneticist=a person engaged in the advancement 
of the science of Genetics.

with regard to the degree of development of 
the somatic characters studied. This measure 
is obtained by the calculation of correlation 
coefficients, a method which owes its origin 
to Sir Francis Galton’s_study_of the inheri- 
tance of human stature, but is now applied 
to many other purposes./ Human stature is 
a character which, probably on account of 
its dependence on a large number of gametic 
factors, and possibly owing to its suscepti- 
bility to environmental influences, has not 
hitherto been shown to be transmitted accord- 
ing to Mendel’s laws. Thus for historical 
and practical reasons Galton’s study of its 
inheritance may conveniently be taken as 
an example of the statistical method. 
The material which he! used consisted of 
records of the heights of 928 adults grouped 
in 205 fraternities, together with the heights © 
of their parents. In order to be able to group 
men and women together in the same table, 
it was necessary to transmute the stature 
of the women in order to make them com- 
parable with those of men. This was done 
by: adding to each observed female stature 
one inch for every foot of the actual measure- 
ment; for example, when a woman’s real 
height was five feet, in order to make it 
equivalent to a man’s height, Galton added 
five inches, thus converting it into five fect 
five inches, before entering it in his tables. 
1 Vide Galton, Natural Inheritance.
-P-A-G-E-114
  110 EUGENICS 
Further, in order to take both parents into 
account, when studying the relation of their 
stature to that of the children, he did not 
use the heights of the fathers separately to 
that of the mothers, but after transmuting 
the height of the mother he took an average 
between that and the father’s height. This 
average he called the stature of the Mid- 
parent. 
After these preliminaries were completed, 
a double classification was made: the 
children were first arranged in fourteen 
elasses, according to stature, and then each 
elass was divided again into groups according 
te the stature of the mid-parent. The results 
thus obtained were written in tabular form.? 
(Vide Table I.) The table may be read either 
as a series of vertical columns or of horizontal 
rows. Each column is headed by a number 
which signifies the central height in inches 
of the class of ‘children’ contained in it. Thus 
the third column from the left is headed 
63-2. As the total range of each class is 
one inch, this means that all the ‘children’ in 
the class lie within half an inch above or 
half an inch below 68:2 inches. 
Corresponding numbers are placed at the 
left-hand end of each row. Thus the num- 
ber 72°5 is placed at the end of the second 
tow. This signifies that all the ‘children’ 
entered in the row have mid-parents whose

stature falls within half an inch of 72°5 
inches. 
Let us consider the entries of the fifth 
column in detail. It is headed 65-2 inches, 
and near its foot may be found the figure 48, 
which represents the total number of children 
recorded in the column. By looking down it 
one may see that one of the 48 falls in the 
71°5 inch row, one in the 70°5 inch, four in the 
69°5 inch, 16 in the 68°5 inch, and so on. 
The meaning of the column, therefore, is, 
that when the whole number (928) of adult 
children were divided into one-inch classes 
according to stature, 48 fell within the class 
centred at 5 ft. 5°2 inches, and that when 
these were sub-divided according to the stature 
of the mid-parents, one was found to have 
a mid-parent in the group centred at 5 ft. 
114 inches, another in the next lowest group, 
four more in the group centred at 5 ft. 94 
inches, 16 in the group below that, and 
15, 2, 7, 1, 1 in the succeeding five sub- 
divisions. 
The other columns record corresponding 
facts about the remaining 880 ‘children,’ 
which can be easily understood when once 
the principle on which the table is con- 
structed has been mastered. 
The horizontal rows may be read off in 
exactly the same manner, they only differ 
from the columns in that the primary classi- 
fication is according to the height of the 
|  
-P-A-G-E-117
  EUGENICS 113 
mid-parents, while the secondary  classi- 
fication is based on the stature of the children. 
In the lowest row and in the extreme right- 
hand column of the table are entries of a 
different character, described as ‘medians.’ 
Thus the column headed 68-2 inches has at 
its foot the number 66°8, and the row which 
has in its left-hand division the figure 72°5 
has at its right the number 72°2. It is on 
these figures that attention should now be 
focussed, because they provided the clue 
which led to the invention of the statistical 
methods for measuring correlation. 
The figure 66°3 at the foot of the column 
headed 63°2 means that the median! stature 
of the mid-parents whose children fell in the 
5 ft. 8-2 inch group column was 5 ft. 6°3 
inchés; in the fourth column, in which were 
entered children an inch taller, the median 
stature of the mid-parent rises to 5 ft. 7:8 
inches, and it goes on rising on the whole, 
though rather unsteadily as the stature of 
the children rises. It will, however, be 
noted that the rise in the on2 case is not so 
rapid as in the other. 
The figure 72-2 at the right-hand end of 
the second row indicates that the median 
height of all the children whose mid-parents 
were in the 6 ft. 0°5 inch group was 6 ft. 0:2 
inches. In the next lowest group it was 
1In considering human stature the median may be 
taken as equivalent to the average. 
 
-P-A-G-E-118

5 ft. 9°9, and below that again 5 ft. 9-5, and 
so on, descending steadily, but not quite 
regularly to the lowest but one, where it is 
entered as 65°8 inches, or 5 ft. 5°8 inches. 
The medians for the outside columns and 
rows were not calculated because, owing to 
the small number of the entries in them, 
they would not give reliable enough results. 
It is very difficult to grasp the significance 
of a table containing many figures, conse- 
quently statisticians almost invariably try — 
to represent such tables by appropriate 
diagrams. Figure 2 is a diagram drawn to 
represent the essential facts which may be 
learnt from Table I. In it each column of 
the table is represented by a vertical line, 
and each row by a horizontal line; the dis- 
tance between each vertical line and the lines 
on either side of it is the same throughout, 
and may be taken to represent one inch in 
stature, because the centres of the classes 
and groups into which the ‘children’ were 
divided fell one inch apart. The horizontal 
lines have the same spacing as the vertical 
ones. As the vertical and horizontal lines 
cross one another at right angles, it follows 
that the former divide each of the latter up 
into equal parts, thus converting it into a 
scale of inches, and in the same way the ver- 
tical lines are each divided by the horizontal 
fines into similar scales. This enables one 
to mark by a dot in the centre of a small
-P-A-G-E-119
EUGENICS 115 
circle on the vertical lines the median height 
of the mid-parent associated with children of 
each particular stature. In the same way 
the middle points of small crosses are used on 
the horizontal lines to mark the median stature 
of the children associated with mid-parents of 
each group. A diagram of a kind essentially 
similar to this was constructed by Galton, 
and it enabled him to note that the circkes 
fell roughly on a straight line and so did the 
crosses; so it occurred to him that the slope 
of these lines might be used as measure of 
the degree of interdependence between the 
statures of the mid-parents and the statures 
of the children. 
If there were no connection whatever 
between the two, there would be no reason 
why the height of the mid-parents of all those 
children who fell in the 5 ft. 4°2 class should 
be a little higher than that of those in the 
5 ft. 8:2 class, and a little lower than that 
of those in the 5 ft. 5:2 class. Consequently 
the median mid-parental heights would tend 
to be the same in each case, and if they were 
represented as in Figure 2 the little circles 
would lie clustered about the horizontal 
line EF, running at the level at which the 
median height of all the mid-parents taken 
together might be recorded on the scale. 
On the other hand, if an increase or decrease 
of any particular amount in the height of 
the children was associated with an increase     
                                               
-P-A-G-E-120
  116 EUGENICS 
or decrease of an identical amount in the 
median stature of the mid-parents, the circles 
would lie in a line. which sloped upwards 
towards the right hand of the figure at an 
angle of 45 degrees, which is the angle made 
with the sides of a square by a line joining 
two of the corners. 
The slope of a line may be expressed in 
many different ways. For the present pur- 
pose it is convenient to use a trigonometrical 
ratio—namely, the tangent of the angle 
which it makes with the horizontal. This may 
be made clearer by reference to Figure 2. 
Let AB be the straight line which gives the 
best indication of the way in which the little 
circles are distributed, and let the horizontal 
line EF represent the position in which AB 
would be if there were no connection what- 
ever between stature of the mid-parents and 
the stature of the children. Let AB cut 
EF at M. Take any point N on AB, and from 
it draw a line perpendicular to EF and meeting 
EF at O. Then the angle NMO is the angle 
which AB makes with the horizontal, and 
the length of the line NO, divided by the 
length of the line MO, is the tangent of the 
angle NMO. It makes no difference where 
on AB the point N is taken, for the relation 
which NO bears to MO is always the same 
if the angle itself remains the same. 
If instead of considering the diagram we 
consider the facts which it. represents, the  
-P-A-G-E-121
  
  
  EUGENICS 1IY: 
last statement may be interpreted as fol- 
lows :—If a group of children be taken of 
a stature differing from the average stature of 
all the children by any definite amount, 2, 
large or small, then the average height of 
their mid-parents will differ from the average 
height of all the mid-parents taken together 
by an amount which bears a constant rela- 
tion to a. In Figure 2 the line NO is one- 
third of the length of the line MO, and this 
expresses the fact that if one considers a 
group of children who are all three inches 
taller than the general average, the average 
height of their mid-parents will be one inch 
greater than the general average height of 
mid-parents, and if the filial deviation be 
1 inch or 14 inches, or any other amount, the 
associated mid-parental deviation will be one- 
third of it. This fraction, which, as has 
been explajned, represents the slope of the 
line AB, \Galton called the Mid-parental 
Regression) He used the word regression to 
signify that the mid-parents of children whe 
are exceptional in a particular degree are prob- 
ably also exceptional but to a lesser degree; 
in fact, they may be said to have regressed 
or moved backwards towards the average. 
Let us now consider the other sloping line 
on the diagram, CD, which represents most 
nearly the straight line along which the little 
crosses tend to lie. Each little cross repre- 
sents the median height of the children of 
 
-P-A-G-E-122
118 EUGENICS 
the mid-parents belonging to a particular 
stature group. If the height of the children 
m no way depended on the height of their 
mid-parents, the children of any particular 
group of mid-parents would probably have just 
the average tallness, neither more nor less. — 
If this state of affairs were represented on the — 
figure, it would be found that the little crosses _ 
would lie along the vertical line, GH. The 
degree of interdependence between the 
parental and filial statures is thus repre- 
sented in this case by the angle which the 
line CD makes with GH. The tangent of | 
this angle is the length of the line SR, divided 
by the length of the line SM. The fraction 
thus obtained Galton called the ‘Filial 
Regression’; in the present case it is 3. 
Interpreting again in terms of the facts 
represented, we may say that when the mid- 
parental deviation from the average is any 
given amount 2, the associated filial devia- 
tion will be two-thirds of that amount. 
The two lines AB and CD are called regres- 
sion lines. It is now necessary to consider 
how far the tangents of the angles which 
they make in the one case with the vertical 
and in the other with the horizontal form 
a satisfactory measure of the degree of*inter- 
dependence, or, as we will say henceforth, 
of correlation between the filial stature and 
the mid-parental stature. It seems fairly 
obvious that the former must be correlated 
 
-P-A-G-E-123
  
EUGENICS 119 
with the latter to exactly the same extent 
as the latter is correlated with the former. 
Yet we find from the figure that the ‘Filial 
Regression’ is two-thirds, while the ‘Mid- 
parental Regression’ is one-third. Why is 
there this discrepancy, and how can it be 
avoided? The reason for it is not far to 
seek—it lies in the manner of construction 
of that artificial monster the mid-parent. 
He is not one person but an average of two, 
consequently he is far less variable than one 
person. That this must be so, any one whe 
thinks of the matter for a moment will con- 
clude; but it takes some mathematicai 
reasoning to determine how much less the 
variability should be. Its results, but not 
the reasoning itself will be given here; but 
beforehand, a word or two must be said about 
the way in which variability may be measured. 
Let us suppose that we want to measure 
the variability in stature of a population, 
and have for that purpose taken from it at 
random a sample of a thousand individuals. 
At first sight it might appear that the simplest 
thing to do would be to measure the differ- 
ence in height between the shortest and the 
tallest, but this would be misleading, because 
the size of the sample would influence the 
result. A sample 100,000 strong would prob- 
ably contain a very much taller man and 
also a very much shorter man than one of 
only 1000 individuals: A better way is to
-P-A-G-E-124
  120 EUGENICS 
pick out two individuals, one so short that 
only a quarter of the sample are shorter than 
he, and the other so tall that only a quarter 
are taller. These two men may be called the 
quartiles—half the sample lies between them 
in stature and the other half outside them. 
They will differ from one another in stature 
by a certain number of inches, which is not 
made larger by increasing the size of the 
sample or smaller by decreasing it. Half- 
way between them lies the median, than 
whom half the sample are oe and half 
shorter. The two quartiles differ from the 
median by approximately the same amount, 
which is called the quartile deviation. 
Galton used the quartile deviation as a 
measure of variability, and found that in the 
general population it is 1-7 inches, half the 
population differing from the median by 
less than 1-7 inches, and the other half by 
more than that amount. If, instead of 
measuring the variability of individuals, 
averages are taken of pairs selected at random, 
and the variability of these averages is 
measured, then according to mathematical 
theory their quartile deviation would be that 
of the separate members of the general popu- 
lation divided by the square root of two. 
If the quartile deviation in stature of indi- 
viduals is 1°7, then that of pairs would be, 
according to this theory, 1:7 divided by 
»/2, or 1:21 inches. The quartile deviation
-P-A-G-E-125
  EUGENICS 121 
of mid-parents is actually 1-19, a result which 
agrees very well with the theory. 
Since mid-parents are to that extent less 
variable than their adult children, it would 
not be incorrect to say that a deviation from 
the average on their part of any specified 
amount is equivalent to a. deviation on the 
part of the children of the same amount 
multiplied by the square root of two. There- 
fore, if the slope of the regression lines AB 
and CD in Figure 2 is to be used as a true 
measure of correlation, the figure should be 
redrawn with the scale corrected accord- 
ingly. Each division on the horizontal scale 
represents one inch of children’s stature, 
each division on the vertical scale represents 
one inch of mid-parents’ stature. As an inch of 
mid parents’ stature is equivalent to 1X /2 
inches (=1°45 inches) of children’s stature, 
the divisions on the vertical scale should be 
1:45 times as long as those on the horizontal 
scale. 
Let us see what the effect of such an 
alteration would be on the tangents of the 
angles SRM and NMO. 
The tangent of the angle SRM =o =1. 
On the corrected figure SM wculd be 1°45 
(,/2) times as long, but SR would be the 
same length, Therefore an would be equal 
E F
-P-A-G-E-126
122 EUGENICS 
to sage which, divided out, is equal to 
NO 483. The tangent of the angle NMO=776 
=4. On the corrected figure NO would be 
increased 1°45 times in length, but MO would 
remain the same; the value of the tangent 
would therefore be or ‘488, which is 
the same as that of the angle SRM. 
Thus we see that if the regression diagram 
is constructed in such a way that the divisions 
on the two scales which represent inches of 
stature are proportional in absolute length 
to the quartile deviations of mid-parents and 
children, the filial regression line will make the 
same angle with the vertical that the mid: 
parental regression does with the horizontal. 
The tangent of this angle can thus be used 
as a measure of correlation, and is practically 
identical with the earliest form of correlation 
coefficient. 
If the correlation between the mid-parents’ 
and children’s statures were absolutely com- 
plete, then a deviation of any given amount in 
the stature of the one would invariably be 
associated with an equivalent deviation in 
the stature of the other, if the word equivalent 
is taken to mean that the deviation in the 
one would bear the same relation to the 
deviation in the other, as is borne by their  
-P-A-G-E-127
  EUGENICS 128 
respective quartile deviations. Under these 
circumstances the two regression lines would 
coincide in position, forming equal angles 
(of 45 degrees) with the vertical and _hori- 
zontal. The tangent of the angles would 
therefore be in each case equal to unity, and 
the correlation coefficient would consequently 
be one. If there were no correlation, the one 
regression line would be horizontal and the 
other vertical. The lines NO and SR in 
Figure 2 would thus be reduced to points 
which have no length, and the tangents of 
the angles SMR and NMO would conse- 
quently be nothing. The correlation co- 
efficient can thus take any value between 
nothing and unity. 
Although it would be possible and theo- 
retically correct to determine its value 
graphically by drawing a diagram of the kind 
described above, in practice it is formed 
directly from numerical tables, like Table I., 
by arithmetical calculations, which, though 
they are themselves of an easy and straight- 
forward kind, are based on theories involving 
advanced mathematics. Coefficients of the 
kind described above can be calculated to 
determine the degree of the correlation be- 
tween any two associated variables which 
can themselves be measured, as, for instance, 
the height of man and the length of his legs. 
Professor Karl Pearson has devised addi- 
tional methods which can be applied where 
 
-P-A-G-E-128
  124 rT 
no true measurement of the variable charac- 
ters, but only rough grading or classification, 
is possible. They all agree in arriving at a 
number which is equal to unity when the 
correlation is complete, and to nothing when 
there is no correlation, and in representing 
different degrees of correlation by fractions 
which lie between nothing and unity. 
Though all these methods can be, and 
have been, used for the study of heredity, 
so far from their scope being limited to this 
study, it is probable that they may be applied 
more usefully for other purposes, such as the 
investigation of many of the problems found 
elsewhere in Eugenics. It is, therefore, 
important that the reader should grasp as 
firmly as possible what the correlation co- 
efficient means. 
Galton’s statistical investigations into 
heredity gave rise to many more, which have 
been carried on almost entirely by Professor 
Karl Pearson and his pupils. In these sub- 
sequent researches it has been found most 
convenient to keep the two parents and four 
grandparents separate, and not to combine 
them into mid-parents and mid-grandparents. 
Correlation coefficients for a variety of 
characters have been calculated between 
fathers and sons, fathers and daughters, 
mothers and sons, mothers and daughters, 
grandfathers and grandsons, grandmothers 
and grandsons, and so on, and also between
-P-A-G-E-129
  EUGENICS 125 
brother and brother, cousin and cousin, and 
other pairs of relations of different degrees. 
Not only man but many other animals have 
been studied in this way, and certain general 
deductions have been drawn from the results. 
The correlation between the degree of 
development of a character in either parent 
and the degree of development of the same 
character in the children, either sons or 
daughters, taken separately, lies often be- 
tween 42 and ‘52, though higher and lower 
values have been obtained. As an example 
of this rule, may be given the following 
results, obtained by Professor Pearson and 
Miss A. Lee:—}

The coefficients may be taken as measures 
of average resemblance between different 
pairs of relatives, and although they are 
sometimes referred to as ‘coefficients of 
heredity,’ it is incorrect to do so except in 
cases where it may be supposed that the 
whole resemblance is in reality due to heredity, 
and none to the fact that the environmental 
conditions have been more nearly the same 
for members of the same family than for 
members of different families. For such 
characters as stature, span and length of 
forearm, if the families investigated came 
from approximately the same social class, 
the degree of resemblance due to similar 
environment cannot be very large, so prac- 
tically the whole resemblance may be reason- 
ably attributed to heredity. 
Under favourable conditions the results 
obtained by these statistical studies could be 
made of use to edict the probable off- 
spring from marriages of a particular kind. 
The mass results to be expected from a large 
number could by their aid be predicted with 
considerable accuracy, but in individual cases 
they could never do more than indicate a 
probability. The accuracy of the ediction 
would depend on conditions here to be stated, 
in a hypothetical concrete case, for which 
stature can still be conveniently used. 
Suppose a man A marries a woman B, 
what will be the probable adult stature of
-P-A-G-E-131
  EUGENICS 127 
any sons they may have? If A’s height is 
known, but B’s is not known, some clue to 
the probable height of the sons would be 
afforded by the knowledge that the correla- 
tion in stature between father and son was 
514; but if B’s height were also ascertained, 
and the correlation between mothers and sons 
and husbands and wives were known, one 
could speak with much greater certainty. 
If records were at hand of the respective 
statures of A’s father and mother and B’s 
father and mother, and the grand-parental 
coefficients had been calculated, the prophecy 
could be made much more precise, and the 
precision would be increased if knowledge of 
the same kind concerning the remoter an- 
cestry and collaterals was available.1 
It will be seen from this statement that the 
character of the ancestry, as well as the 
character of the parents, influences the nature 
of the offspring; a tall man’s sons are likely 
to be taller if his father and mother are also 
tall, and taller still if the peculiarity was 
present in his grandparents. 
How does this agree with the following 
fact mentioned in the description of Major 
Hurst’s discoveries about the inheritance of 
eye colour in man? ‘Two blue-eyed people 
have all blue-eyed children, no matter how 
3 Professor Karl Pearson’s theory of multiple correla- 
tion enables one to combine individual results in this 
manner.

128 EUGENICS 
many among their parents or grandparents 
had brown eyes; so in this case the eye 
colour of the ancestry appears to be without 
any influence on that of the children. 
Speaking more generally, it may be said 
to follow from the Mendelian theory that 
when the gametic constitution of the parents 
are known, a knowledge of their ancestry 
will not give any additional clue to the 
probable nature of the children. Many 
writers have seen in this apparent conflict 
between the statistical and Mendelian point 
of view evidence of an irreconcilable differ- 
ence between them. There is, however, no 
necessary antagonism here. In the cases 
such as that of stature, a knowledge of the 
stature of the parents gives no indication of 
their gametic constitution, and the additional 
information concerning the grandparents and 
other relatives is useful just because it gives 
some sort of clue to it. In cases of obvious 
Mendelian inheritance where the gametic 
constitution is known, the ancestry may 
safely be neglected; but it is often the charac- 
ters of the ancestors which provide part of 
the data for determining what the gametic 
constitution actually is. 
We have up to this point been attempting 
to show how by the calculation of correlation 
coefficients it is possible to obtain some sort 
of measure of the intensity of inheritance, 
which may be useful as guide to the probable  
-P-A-G-E-133
EUGENICS 129 
results of particular matings. We now 
propose to give an instance of the use of 
statistical methods of a simpler kind for 
answering the easier question whether hered- 
ity does or does not take a share in the 
causation of some particular qualities or 
defects. The instance is one of interest, 
because it deals with a subject which has a 
direct and immediate bearing on Eugenics. 
It is taken from a memoir by Dr J. A. Murray, 
in the fourth scientific Report of the Imperial 
Cancer Research Fund, published in 1911. It 
is now generally accepted that cancer itself 
is not inherited, but that in many forms of 
the disease it is initiated by a ‘long continued 
process of localised chronic irritation.’ The 
question, however, remains whether the ten- 
dency for the part or organ irritated to 
respond by the development of cancer is or 
is not an inherited one. It is a question of 
exceptional difficulty to investigate in human 
beings; but if it can be answered for in another 
mammal, some useful preliminary knowledge 
will have been gained. Dr Murray therefore 
started investigations on mice, which are 
particularly suitable, as they are short-lived 
animals, easily bred, and very liable to be 
attacked by cancer. The nature of his 
material limited him to one particular form 
of the disease,—namely, cancer of the mamma, 
which corresponds to cancer of the breast in 
human beings.
-P-A-G-E-134
180 EUGENICS 
All the mice which he had under observa- 
tion came from strains in which cancer was 
known to have appeared at one time or 
another, so the question he set himself to 
answer was, whether mice whose mothers or 
grandmothers had been thus affected were 
more liable to develop the disease themselves 
than those in whose remote ancestry only it 
had occurred. The mice were all kept under 
standard conditions, so that no disturbing 
effect was to be feared from the environment; 
but in mice, as in human beings, the liability 
to be attacked with cancer varies consider- 
ably from age to age, and accordingly in 
making a comparison between the two classes 
it was necessary to group each according to 
age, and to compare them group by group. 
Let us call the class of mice which had 
mothers or grandmothers with cancer A, 
and the other class whose mothers and grand- 
mothers were free from it B. There were 
found to be 840 female mice in the A class 
and 223 in the B class. Among the A class 
there were sixty-two who had lived to be 
nine months old, and in the B class thirty- 
eight. Among the former 6°5 per cent. had 
died of cancer of the mamma, among the 
latter 2°6 per cent. Sixty-three of the A’s 
had lived to be twelve months old, and in 
11°1 per cent. death had been caused in this 
way, while among the forty-one B’s who had 
lived to this age 9:8 per cent. had suffered.
-P-A-G-E-135
  EUGENICS 181 
24:2 per cent. of the fifteen-month old 
A’s had died of cancer, but only 8°8 per 
cent. among the twenty-six B’s of this 
group; and if one traces them through 
the other classes, the A’s, or those who had 
cancer in their immediate ancestry, invari- 
ably showed a higher percentage than the 
B’s. The following table supplies the actual 
figures :—

On the face of it, the comparison shows 
that inheritance plays some part in the 
causation of mammary cancer in mice; but 
the number compared in each group is rather 
a small one, and it is not easy by the light of 
nature to suy how much reliance may be 
 
-P-A-G-E-136
  182 EUGENICS 
placed on the calculated percentages. In 
deciding this point, Dr Murray follows the 
best practice of statisticians, and applies the 
mathematical theory of probabilities to deter- 
mine whether the differences shown in the 
percentage of cancerous mice in each age- 
group really indicate that the disease is more 
likely to occur in the A class than in the B, 
or whether they are a chance result due to 
the numbers being too small to decide the 
point. Tested by the theory of probabilities, 
it was shown that if each age-group were 
considered separately it was exceedingly 
improbable that the differences shown in the 
fifteen, eighteen, and twenty-one-month 
groups were due to chance, but to the 
remainder no significance could be attached. 
If, however, all the groups are considered 
together, the fact that the differences are 
all in the same direction very greatly 
strengthens the conclusion that the A class, 
with recent cancerous ancestry, is in reality 
the more liable to the disease; a fact which 
ean be most readily accounted for by the 
supposition that the liability to cancer is in 
this case at any rate inherited. 
Dr Murray regards this only as a pro- 
visional conclusion, and perhaps it will be 
said that even if the fact were finally estab- 
lished it would be unsafe to argue from it 
that the tendency to cancer is inherited in 
human beings. In answer, we would point
-P-A-G-E-137
  EUGENICS 183 
out, in the first place, that the investigation 
has only been described here as an instance 
of the application of simple statistical methods 
in a legitimate way for the study of an 
important problem; and, secondly, that in 
the absence of positive evidence to the 
contrary it would be safer to assume that 
the tendency to cancer is inherited in man, 
than to assume that this is not the case. 
SUMMARY OF CHAPTER 
Statistical methods are useful for the study 
of inheritance, at any rate in cases which elude 
Mendelian analysis, either owing to their 
too great complexity or because they are 
exceptions to Mendel’s laws. 
The systematic statistical study of inheri- 
tance was initiated by Sir Francis Galton, 
who invented for this purpose the ‘Regres- 
sion Diagram,’ and expressed the degree of 
resemblance between parents and children, 
and between members of the same fraternity 
by regression coefficients, which were calcu- 
lated graphically by drawing lines and measur- 
ing their steepness. The regression coefficients 
had certain disadvantages which are absent 
in the correlation coefficients. The earliest 
form of correlation coefficient is essentially 
the regression coefficient modified by drawing 
the regression diagram in such a way that 
the quartile deviation (or other measure of
-P-A-G-E-138
  
184 EUGENICS 
variability) of one of the two associated varia- 
bles is represented on the vertical scale of 
the diagram by a line equal in length to that 
which represents the quartile deviation of the 
other variable on the horizontal scale. It is, 
however, usually arrived at by an arithmetical 
and not by a graphical process. The great 
development of the theory of correlation is 
due to Professor Karl Pearson, who has 
invented methods by which the degree of 
interdependence between the variables may 
be measured, even if the variables themselves 
cannot be directly measured, but can only 
be divided into grades or classes. 
The sort of generalisations concerning 
heredity which may be arrived at by the 
calculation of correlation coefficients are then 
described and their possible use in predicting 
probabilities. The chapter concludes with 
a description of a statistical research into 
the inheritance of the tendency to develop 
cancer among mice, as an example of the 
kind of results which can sometimes be 
obtained by the use of quite simple methods.

CHAPTER VII 
THE INHERITANCE OF ABILITY 
In his Memories of My Life, Galton writes 
that in the year 1860, or thereabouts, ‘most 
authors agreed that all bodily and some 
mental qualities were inherited by brutes, 
but they refused to believe the same of man.’ 
Man’s physical qualities might be inherited, 
but his mental qualities were not. But 
owing to Galton’s own investigations, and 
those of other writers, a mass of data was 
accumulated which seemed to show that 
this view was a wrong one, and that mental 
character followed the same rule as physical. 
Thus gradually psychic inheritance was 
accepted as a firmly established fact, and 
replaced in fiction other and vaguer forms 
of the ever-popular ‘Hand of Destiny.’ 
It is doubtful whether its reality would 
now be doubted, if it were not that it seems 
to conflict with many cherished beliefs and 
many educational theories. ‘Yet whatever 
the reasons may be, there appears at the 
present day so strong a tendency to question 
it, that it is worth while to pass in review 
the evidence in its favour, in order to show, 
if possible, that it is worthy of credence. 
If physical characters only were inherited
-P-A-G-E-140
  186 EUGENICS 
there would still be some reason for Eugenics, 
but its scope is vastly extended by including 
with them the propensities and peculiarities 
of the mind. 
A complete account of the evidence is of 
course impossible in a work of this kind, 
for its full consideration might occupy a 
large volume. It is, however, possible to 
give some indication of its nature, and 
although no claim will be made that a rigid 
proof of the inheritance of mental faculties 
has been established, it is hoped that as good 
a case will be made out as many on which 
a man has been hanged. 
As few will dispute that mental diseases, 
deformities, or deficiencies are or may be 
inherited, their consideration will be reserved 
for another chapter; in this place ‘ability’ 
will be the principal subject discussed. 
Ability depends partly on certain inborn 
qualities of mind and partly on education. 
Psychologists distinguish between mental 
capacity and mental contents. The latter 
consist of memories, faculties, and habits 
which, with the aid of the former, have been 
implanted in the mind by education and 
experience. It is not supposed that mental 
contents are inherited, so the student of 
heredity is concerned directly only with 
mental capacity; but he is met at once by 
the difficulty that in the majority of cases 
‘there is no measure of mental capacity but
-P-A-G-E-141
  EUGENICS 187 
mental contents. And the difficulty does 
not end here, for in most of the data. avail- 
able he has often no satisfactory way of 
estimating mental contents, but must rely on 
records of achievements which depend, at 
any rate, partly on opportunity. Psychol- 
ogists are now devising means for arriving 
at a direct measure of mental capacity, and 
one may eventually look to their efforts for 
providing material for the study of its inheri- 
tance; but as up to the present little has been 
achieved in this direction, we have to fall 
back on older and less precise methods. 
An example of results obtained by these is 
Galton’s Hereditary Genius; here he endeav- 
ours to prove that ‘genius’ is hereditary by 
showing ‘how large is the number of instances 
in which men who are more or less illustrious 
have eminent kinsfolk.’ Writing in 1865, he 
does not use the word genius in the sense 
in which it is commonly used now, and he 
explains in the prefatory chapter of the edition 
of 1892 that if the title could then be altered 
he would alter it to Hereditary Ability; at the 
same time, he is careful to explain that the 
word ability does not truly represent his 
meaning, as it does not exclude the effects of 
education. 
Galton uses the words eminent and illus- 
trious in perfectly definite senses. The 
former term is applied to people who have 
achieved a position about equivalent te
-P-A-G-E-142
188 EUGENICS 
that attained by one person in 4000. The 
word illustrious is only applied to the few 
who reach the far higher level attained by 
only one in a million. He proceeds to argue 
that reputation which leads to distinction 
is a true test of natural ability, provided 
that reputation is taken to mean ‘the opinion 
of contemporaries revised by posterity,’ and 
that natural ability is ‘those qualities of 
intellect and disposition which urge and 
qualify a man to perform acts that lead to 
reputation’—for instance, capacity, zeal, and 
the power of doing a great deal of very 
laborious work. The opportunities for rising 
are so numerous that a man provided with 
these gifts is almost certain to rise to a posi- 
tion in which they will be recognised. ‘Social 
hindrances cannot impede men of high 
ability from becoming eminent.’ ‘Social 
advantages are incompetent to give that 
status to men of moderate ability.’ 
After giving many reasons to support 
these views, Galton goes on to examine the 
relatives of groups of men eminent in different 
walks of life. The English judges between the 
years 1660 and 1865, who are described in 
Foss’s Lives of the Judges, are taken as the 
first group. They number 286, and of these 
109 have one or more eminent relatives, and 
upwards of seventy, two or more. 
If only one person in 4000 reaches the 
degree of distinction classed by Galton as 
 
-P-A-G-E-143
  EUGENICS 189 © 
‘eminence,’ it is obvious from these figures 
that the relative of a judge has many times 
a greater chance to become eminent than any 
person chosen at random from other sections 
of the community. But Galton does not 
rely for his demonstration of heredity on 
arguments such as these, but goes on to 
inquire to what extent the nearness of rela- 
tionship gives an additional chance of attain- 
ing this degree of success. Taking the 
families in which several eminent men were 
_ found, he groups the various members accord- 
ing to their degree of kinship to the most 
gifted member, and then finds the percentage 
of eminent men in each group. Among the 
descendants 86 per cent. of the sons were 
eminent, 9 per cent. of the grandsons, and 14 
per cent. of the great-grandsons; among the 
ascendants, 26 per cent. of the fathers, 74 per 
cent. of the grandfathers, and } per cent. of 
the great-grandfathers. Among collaterals 
there is a similar falling off as one moves 
farther away from the central figure. 
In addition to this it was found that among 
the more distinguished of the judges the 
percentage of those who had eminent relatives 
was more than twice as high as among the 
less distinguished. In the families of twenty- 
four out of thirty, or 80 per cent, of the Lord 
Chancellors eminence was reached by other 
members, while in the families of the remaining 
256 judges this occurred in only 90 cases, or 
 
-P-A-G-E-144
  140 EUGENICS 
86 per cent. To meet the obvious objection 
that Lord Chancellors have more opportunity 
than others of thrusting their relatives into 
eminence by jobbery, Galton goes in detail 
into the families of the twenty-four Lord 
Chancellors, and finds that there is little 
doubt of the real ability of the eminent men 
among them. 
- These conclusions were supported by those 
arrived at upon applying the same methods 
of consideration to the families of men pre- 
eminent in other walks of life. 
The problem is attacked in a slightly 
different manner in a more recent work,? in 
which an attempt is made to estimate how 
many members of the families of the Fellows 
of the Royal Society attained in their own 
occupations an amount of distinction about 
equivalent to that sufficient to qualify a 
scientist for the fellowship. Accounts are 
given of those families in which three or more 
of the members had at least this amount of 
success, and a cursory glance through them 
should be enough to convince any one that 
the accumulations of such men in particular 
families can hardly be attributed to chance. 
One may, of course, be willing to concede 
this, and yet deny that heredity is the effec- 
tive cause. A particularly favourable en- 
vironment common to the members might 
be sufficient to bring about the same result.

We will return to this point after considering 
further: evidence. 
In order to meet the objection that family 
patronage is sufficient in itself to be taken 
as the reason of the kind of facts recorded 
above, Dr Woods! collected data of some- 
thing the same kind in America, where, he 
argued, owing to different social conditions, 
family influence is not so powerful and the 
opportunities for distinction are much less 
unequally distributed than in the older 
countries. On the banks of the Hudson, in 
New York, is an arcade which contains 
memorials to those who have been the most 
illustrious members of the American Republic. 
Only forty-seven people have up till now been 
admitted to this Temple of Fame, the qualifi- 
eations for admission to which are extremely 
high. In our country the claims of candi- 
dates for the highest posthumous honours 
are decided on in a hurry by persons selected 
for quite a different purpose, and upon 
qualifications only slightly connected with 
their ability to form a sound opinion on this 
particularly difficult question. Thus it might 
happen that the merely temporary wave of 
popular appreciation, on which public men 
are sometimes raised. during their lifetimes, is 
sufficient to carry them up to the highest

honours with which the nation can express 
its gratitude to the great men who have died. 
In order to avoid this danger, no one is allowed 
to enter the American Hall of Fame until 
several years after his death, and then only 
with the approval of a committee of a hundred 
of the most distinguished men of the day. 
Dr Woods set on foot an investigation into 
the family histories of these forty-seven in 
order to find how many were related as closely, 
or more closely, than grandfather to grandson, 
to members of another group of 8500 men 
whose distinction was of a considerably 
lower degree, but high enough to warrant 
their inclusion in one or other of two standard 
biographical dictionaries. Fully one-half of 
the forty-seven had close relatives among 
the 3500, and for the whole forty-seven, the 
average was more than one apiece. Now the 
chances of any man, taken at random, having 
so close a relative in this larger group is about 
one in 500 to one in 1000. So Dr Woods 
concludes: ‘The amount of distinguished 
relationship which the Hall of Fame gives 
is about a thousand times the random expec- 
tation.” He goes on to say, ‘Intellectual 
distinction is just as much of a family affair 
in the new country and in a freer atmos- 
phere as it is on this! side of the Atlantic, 
where the social lines are supposed to be 
more strictly drawn.’ 
He was speaking in London.

We will next describe some statistical 
results of a rather different kind obtained 
by an analysis of the Oxford examination 
records.1 The arrangements of the final 
examinations, qualifying for the degree of 
Bachelor of Arts at the University of Oxford, 
are such that it is possible to divide the men 
who have gone through the University into 
six classes with respect to their success. 
They may pass these examinations with 
honours of four different grades—first class, 
second class, third class, and fourth class; 
they may pass without honours; or they 
may fail to pass at all. It is thus possible to 
form a sort of scale of success with first-class 
honours at the top and failure to obtain a 
degree at the bottom, and the six divisions 
of the scale will form a rough measure of the 
kind of ability which enables people to succeed 
in examinations. It is not claimed that men 
divided according to this scale will be really 
accurately sorted, for many good men are 
prevented by accidental circumstances from 
taking degrees, and some who are capable of 
obtaining fairly high honours may be led by 
a variety of motives to attempt nothing more 
ambitious than a pass. 
Whether the honours examinations really 
test the kind of ability that is usefyl in after . 
life is an open question, but it may safely be

E. M. Elderton.
-P-A-G-E-148
144 EUGENICS 
asserted that they form a fairly accurate 
measure of one particular kind of talent, for 
a man’s tutor is able to gauge the class to 
which he will attain with so much accuracy, 
that it is evident that whatever may be 
the conditions most favourable to success, 
it can rarely be merely due to a happy 
chance. It is not our purpose to analyse 
the special talents which lead to success 
in examinations, but it may safely be asserted 
that they are formed from mental qualities 
which are present to a most marked degree 
in first-class honours men, to a slightly less 
degree in second-class men, and so on down 
the scale. Pass men have it developed on the 
average less than those placed in the fourth 
class, and more than those who do not obtain 
degrees. It must be remembered in review- 
ing the results that what inaccuracies this 
method of measurement introduces will tend 
to weaken rather than strengthen the 
apparent amount of resemblance shown 
between members of the same family, except 
where they are introduced by the action of 
family custom or tradition, when they will 
be likely to have the opposite effect. 
The system of honours was introduced 
into the University in the year 1800, and 
records were available of the degree taken 
by each man who entered from that. year 
to 1892, and of the degrees taken by 
their fathers and brothers, if these had 
   
-P-A-G-E-149
  EUGENICS 145: 
also been at the University during this 
period. 
There were about 4000 men between the 
years mentioned, whose fathers had also 
been up, and had had the opportunity of 
entering for honours. These were first 
divided into two groups, according to the date 
at which they took or failed to take their 
degrees. 2459 were placed in the most recent 
group, and were found to consist of 149 men 
with first-class honours, 829 who were placed 
in the second class, 877 in the third, and 190 
in the fourth. 868 had taken a pass degree, 
and 546 had taken no degree at all. Each of 
these six classes was subdivided according 
to the nature of the degree taken by the 
father, and a table was constructed on much 
the same principle as Table I., Chapter VI. 
It is unnecessary to go into the details of 
the table here, some of the essential facts 
which could be deduced from it are shown in 
Figure III., in which the percentage of 
fathers who took either first or second class 
honours is shown, by the length of a vertical 
line, for each of the six groups of sons. The 
steady way in which this percentage sinks as 
one passes down from the highest group to 
the lowest is the feature to which it is desired 
to call attention. The same phenomenon 
recurs among the earlier group of sons in 
a manner almost more decisively marked.

significance of which is described in the last 
chapter, the resemblance between fathers and 
sons with regard to the degree taken can be 
represented as about ‘8, or almost one- 
third. The result is not very different whether 
the earlier or the later group is dealt with. 
The resemblance between brother and 
brother was measured in an almost identical 
way. The material was divided in this case 
into three groups, according to the period 
in which the degrees were taken, but closely 
accordant results were obtained in each case. 
The coefficient of resemblance never differed 
widely from °4. The school lists of two public 
. schools—namely, Harrow and Charterhouse— 
were subjected to an analysis of a very similar 
kind, which, in so far as it went, provided 
corroborative results. It was not possible 
on the basis of this material to draw any 
comparison between fathers and sons, but 
the resemblance between brothers was shown 
to be about as close as was indicated by the 
consideration of the Oxford Examination lists. 
The resemblance between children of the 
same parents with regard to some physical 
and intellectual characters was the subject 
of an important research conducted by 
Professor Karl Pearson, with the assist- 
ance of many collaborators. His ‘Huxley 
Lecture,’! delivered before the Anthropologicai 
Institute, contains a description of the results

of this investigation. The material on which 
it was based was collected by the masters 
and mistresses in a very large number of 
different schools. The mental or physical 
characters investigated were Vivacity, Asser- 
tiveness, Introspection, Popularity, Conscien- 
tiousness, Temper, Ability, Hand-writing. 
As no means has yet been discovered for 
obtaining a direct mechanical measure of any 
of these qualities, the estimates of the school 
masters and mistresses had to be relied on. 
From these estimates the boys and girls 
could be divided for each character into two 
classes. Take as an example ‘ability.’ In 
the directions which were sent out as to how 
the blank schedules should be filled in, 
instructions were given to assign to each 
child one of the following six grades of intelli- 
gence:—Quick Intelligent, Intelligent, Slow 
Intelligent, Slow, Slow Dull, Very Dull. 
But in constructing the tables the first two 
grades were united to form one class and the 
lower four grades the other. From one table 
it was then found that when the two classes 
into which the six original grades were 
grouped are called respectively Intelligent 
and Dull, 666 pairs of sisters were both 
intelligent and 655 were both dull, and in 
the remaining 792 cases one was intelligent 
and the other dull. 
From figures such as these correlation co- 
efficients can be calculated with perfect
-P-A-G-E-153
  EUGENICS 149 
facility. Each of the eight psychical char- 
acters was treated in this way, and for each 
the correlation between brother and brother, 
sister and sister, and brother and sister were 
worked out. Thus twenty-four coefficients 
were obtained, of which none was lower 
than ‘42, and none higher than ‘62. The 
majority clustered round °52. 
These values are probably higher than would 
be the case if an accurate impersonal measure 
of the degree of the development of the 
characters invesitgated had been made. 
There is, however, no means available for 
making such a measure, and we must there- 
fore be content with estimates such as were 
used. They would probably not introduce 
any serious error, if it could be assured that 
the same standard was applied by each 
teacher; but, as in marking examination 
papers some examiners are apt to give slightly 
higher marks than others, so it is probable 
that one teacher would enter boys or girls 
as intelligent, whom another would regard 
as slow intelligent, or a third as quick intelli- 
gent. As both members of the same pair 
would often be judged by the same teacher, 
the result would be that out of a group of 
children who all really belonged to the 
intelligent class some pairs of brothers or 
sisters would be entered in the quick intelli- 
gent and others in the slow intelligent class. 
Mutatis mutandis the same would be true
-P-A-G-E-154
  150 EUGENICS 
about the higher and lower divisions of the 
intelligence scale and about the other psychical 
characters. This would give rise to an 
apparent correlation between children of the 
same parents, even if there were no real 
resemblance between them. 
It would be unfair to say this without also 
explaining that where the two members of 
a pair were not judged by the same teachers, 
differences in the standards employed might 
give rise to apparent diversity in cases where 
there was real similarity, and simple faults of 
judgment would tend to have the same 
effect. Thus errors in the values of the corre- 
lation coefficients introduced in the manner 
first described would be counterbalanced to 
some extent, though probably not entirely, 
by those last described, which have a different 
influence on the results. 
Up to this point we have endeavoured to 
show by the consideration of evidence drawn 
from various sources that members of the 
same family tend to resemble one another 
with regard to their mental characters, and 
that this resemblance can be roughly 
measured. We have not tried to prove that 
it is due in any degree to heredity. 
If mental characters were wholly due to the 
environment, resemblances between persons 
closely related to one another would also be 
shown, since it is probably true that members 
of the same family are subjected to more
-P-A-G-E-155
  
EUGENICS 151 
nearly similar environmental influences than 
members of different families. While admit- 
ting that part of the resemblance may be 
accounted for in this way, we intend to argue 
that certain facts are absolutely inconsistent 
with the supposition that the whole may be, 
and that if to some extent psychical char- 
acters are not determined by the environ- 
ment, then to that extent the most credible 
theory to account for them is that mental 
capacity is inherited. 
This argument has been put forward in 
a forcible manner by Dr Woods, as a result 
of his studies on heredity, as shown in the 
pedigrees of royal personages, and his words 
will here be quoted :— 
‘When complete pedigrees can be con- 
structed and information obtained concerning 
the. lives, achievements, and characteristics 
of whole family groups, the wicked as well as 
the virtuous, the stupid as well as the 
brilliant, it becomes evident at once, on 
examining such charts, that the strongest 
contrasts are everywhere the rule, even among 
those close of kin. A similar environment 
ought, if effective, to mould people towards the 
same mental pattern. But royalty, historically 
considered, has not been so moulded. There 
is. no reasonable cause why Frederick the 
Great was so different from his weak-kneed 
and almost forgotten ancestor, George William 
of Brandeburg, except inborn determiners.’
-P-A-G-E-156
  152 EUGENICS 
It is unnecessary to raise one’s imagina- 
tion to these extreme social altitudes to reach 
a similar conclusion. Most people with 
fairly developed powers of observation, who 
have had reasonable opportunities for mixing 
with their fellows, should be able to some 
extent to examine the question in the light 
of their own personal experience. Familiarity 
with the characteristics of several members of 
half a dozen families will generally reveal 
differences between brothers which cannot be 
accounted for by pointing to any differences 
in the conditions under which they were 
brought up. 
The fact that sharp contrasts in character 
and ability between near relatives do un- 
doubtedly exist is quite incompatible with the 
view that mental qualities are determined 
wholly by the environment, but is consistent 
with theories of heredity, which, like the 
Mendelian, recognise alternative inheritance 
or the circumstance that characters latent 
through many generations may reappear 
clearly and definitely when the right combina- 
tion of gametes or germplasm is formed. 
The conclusion that mental capacity is to 
some extent inherited seems to follow almost 
as a necessity from this train of argument. 
But we will not leave it without examining 
other facts, which may directly corroborate 
it. For these we will turn first to the com- 
paratively new science of Experimental
-P-A-G-E-157
EUGENICS 158 
Psychology. The general aim of this science 
is to describe and analyse mental processes 
by devising experiments to test quite simple 
faculties. Its primary object is to find out 
the way in which the mind works, but its 
methods of investigation can be applied 
profitably to the study of inheritance. It 
deals with characters which are much simpler 
and much less dependent on education or 
environment than any which can be estimated 
by success in life or success in examinations. 
Frequently a positive measure of some kind 
can be applied which does not depend on 
the idiosyncrasies of the person who applies 
it, thus the chances of error referred to in 
describing Pearson’s work on the inheritance 
of psychical characters may be entirely 
eliminated. 
The contributions which experimental psy- 
chology has made up tothe present to the study 
of inheritance are very small, but such as they 
are they seem a step in the right direction. 
As an example may be taken some of 
the work of Mr Cyril Burt,! who compared 
three groups of children of the same age, 
the first from a preparatory school at Oxford, 
the second from a higher elementary school 
at Oxford, and the third from Liverpool 
slums. The first group were for the most 
1 ‘Experimental Tests of Higher Mental Processes and 
their relation to General Intelligence,’ Journal of Experi- 
mental Pedagogy, 1911. ‘The Inheritance of Mental 
Characters,’ Eugenics Review, July, 1912. 
 
-P-A-G-E-158
  154 EUGENICS 
part the sons of - university professors, 
college lecturers and tutors, Fellows of the 
Royal Society, and bishops—all men whose 
position in life depended to a great extent 
on their intellectual attainments. The second 
group were principally the sons of small 
tradesmen. 
The tests applied were very various in 
their nature; some of them were thought 
by the boys to be like drawing-room games. 
For instance, one of the most reliable, ‘The 
Alphabet Test, consists in measuring with 
a stop-clock the number of seconds required 
to pick out, in order, one complete alphabet 
from two alphabets of cardboard letters, 
arranged in irregular array upon a prepared 
sheet.’ In another the boys were required 
to erase the letters O and E from a page of 
capital letters printed in haphazard order. 
The number of letters correctly erased in 
two minutes was taken as the measure of 
success. 
A third was a missing-word test: ‘A piece 
of prose is given with certain words omitted, 
and the boys had to supply in the places 
left the words that best completed the meaning 
suggested by the context.’ 
In another the boys were given a sheet of 
paper, on which 100 words were printed in 
columns; they were required to write opposite 
to each the first word suggested by it. Thus 
after black such words as ink or white could
-P-A-G-E-159
  EUGENICS 155 
be written. The number of words supplied 
in 7} minutes was here used as the measure. 
In addition to the tests here described, many 
others were employed, and the results corre- 
lated with the teachers’ estimates of the boys’ 
intelligence. It was found that, for some of 
them the correlation was fairly high, for 
others less high, or absent, or even negative. 
In these tests, which were highly corre- 
lated with general intelligence, the Oxford 
preparatory school boys did uniformly better 
than the Oxford elementary school boys, 
while the latter were considerably in advance 
of the boys from the Liverpool slums. In the 
alphabet test, for instance, the average time 
taken by the first-named group was 74 
seconds, by the second 91 seconds, and by 
the last 123 seconds. 
It would be difficult to explain these results 
on any other theory than that mental 
capacity is inherited. Whatever are the 
innate differences between university pro- 
fessors, small tradesmen, and the denizens 
of the Liverpool slums, by the time they 
reach adult life there is little question that 
the order in which they would be placed 
with regard to their intellectual qualities is 
the same as that in which they are here 
written, and it can hardly be maintained 
that the sons of the first group have much 
better opportunities for acquiring the faculties 
which enable them to come well out of
-P-A-G-E-160
  156 EUGENICS 
the alphabet test than those of the second 
group. 
Mr Burt? has also been able to obtain 
some more direct evidence by measuring the 
correlation between adults and their parents 
for various relatively simple psychical char- 
acters. For the degree of sensitiveness of the 
skin, measured by the eesthesiometer, the 
coefficient of correlation was found to be ‘29. 
For ‘Reaction Time’ (i.e. the interval that 
elapses between the exhibition or application 
of a stimulus to an individual and his response 
to it in a prescribed manner) the coefficients 
of correlation were found to be 33, where the 
stimulus was some object suddenly displayed, 
and ‘27 when the signal was given by sound. 
In addition to this, Professor Thorndike,? 
of Columbia University, investigated the 
resemblance between twins, using tests of 
a somewhat similar nature to those employed 
by Mr Burt (marking particular letters in 
printed sheets of letters arranged at random, 
or words in an unknown foreign language; 
marking misspelt words in a passage of easily 
worded prose; adding and multiplying simple 
sums; supplying words meaning the opposite 
of those in a printed list supplied). The 
degree of similarity between the twins of 
a pair was found to be very high. The 
1 From an account very kindly given to the author 
by Mr Burt of some researches still in progress. 
2 Thorndike, Educational Psychology.
-P-A-G-E-161
  EUGENICS 157 
correlation coefficients between them for the 
various characters measured were never lower 
than °69, and went up to ‘90. Professor 
Thorndike is careful to point out that twins 
are probably under the influence of a very 
similar environment, to which some of thé 
resemblance may be due; but argues that. if 
the environment is its principal cause, the 
resemblance ought to increase as the children 
grow older and the environment has more and 
more time to act on them. Instead of this 
being the case, he found on dividing them into 
two groups, one aged 9-11 and the other 
12-14, that the resemblance is actually closer 
in the former group than in the latter. The 
correlation between children of the same 
parents a few years apart in age for some of 
the same characters was found to be con 
siderably less than that between twins. 
Both Mr Burt’s results and those of Profes- 
sor Thorndike are based on numbers which 
are rather small to deduce any but provisional 
conclusions from, and there are additional 
objections to the work of the latter; yet when 
all allowances are made, there remains 
evidence of some importance when taken in 
conjunction with that previously cited, while 
the methods which they have indicated ought 
in the future to prove a fruitful source of 
more accurate knowledge of the subject. 
A study of the differences in the mental 
powers of different races is another field to
-P-A-G-E-162
  1o3 EUGENICS 
which one might turn for evidence of inheri- 
tance. If it were found that the inter-racial 
differences are considerable and could not be 
accounted for by differences in the conditions 
of life, it would be fair to conclude that 
inheritance played a part in their causation. 
Unfortunately there appears to be no sub- 
ject on which accurate data are less easily 
obtained than this, and it would be unsafe to 
base any argument for inheritance on the 
slender material at present available. The 
general conclusion to be drawn from it is 
that uncivilised races, with one or two excep- 
tions, are not markedly different with regard 
to some mental characters from societies 
which have been in a high state of culture for 
many centuries. From this, one inference may 
perhaps be drawn which supports the basic 
principles of selective Eugenics—namely, 
that centuries, even millennia, of culture 
have not succeeded in affecting any marked 
improvement in man’s mental nature, there- 
fore the mental development which is one of 
the objects and results of education does not 
appear to be inherited. 
The directed evidence bearing on the 
inheritance of mental capacity has now been 
sufficiently discussed, but there are certain 
@ priori arguments bearing on the question 
which deserve a passing mention. 
It may well be, and has been, claimed that 
the distinction between mental and physical
-P-A-G-E-163
  EUGENICS 159 
characters is more apparent than real. 
Mental characters may be regarded, to some 
extent at any rate, as the outward expression 
of such undoubted physical characters as 
the structure of certain parts of the brain. 
There are many facts recorded to suggest 
such a view. For obvious reasons it is difficult 
to prove that brain structure is inherited, 
but it would be surprising if it were an 
exception to the rule which applies to every 
other part of the body, and some direct 
observations have been made which seem to 
show that this is not the case. The brains of 
two or three members of a certain number of 
families have been removed after death and 
their external features compared, and it has 
been found definitely that as to the manner 
in which the surface is infolded there is more 
resemblance between members of the same 
family than between members of different 
families. Though this external configuration 
may not be a character on which mental 
capacity depends to any very large extent, 
the fact of its hereditary transmission un- 
doubtedly tends to show that the brain is 
merely a part of the body subject to the same 
laws as other parts, and therefore that if 
special or general ability depends to some 
extent on its structure to that extent it too 
will be inherited. 
After considering the published evidence 
a word must be said of facts which most people
-P-A-G-E-164
160 EUGENICS 
may collect for themselves. They are difficult 
to record, but are perhaps more convincing 
than any quantity of statistics. If one knows 
well several members of a family, one is bound 
to see in them likenesses with regard to mental 
traits, both large and small, which may some- 
times be accounted for by example on the 
one hand or unconscious imitation on the 
other, but are often quite inexplicable .on any 
other theory than heredity. It is difficult 
to understand how the inheritance of mental 
capacity can be denied by those whose eyes 
are open and whose minds are open too. 
SUMMARY OF CHAPTER 
This chapter provides a brief survey of 
the evidence on which the case for the inheri- 
tance of mental characters such as ability 
tests. Resemblance in achievement and 
reputation between members of the same 
family is shown by Galton’s work on Hereditary 
Genius, part of which is here described, and 
by other work of a similar nature. It is 
argued that such similarity in reputation 
depends largely on similarity in the ability, 
without which the reputations would not 
have been made, even if family influence 
provided exceptional opportunities for it. 
Dr Woods’s researches on the relatives of 
Americans whose distinction has been recog- 
nised by placing them in the Temple of Fame 
 
-P-A-G-E-165
  EUGENICS 161 
show that in a country where family patronage 
is much less powerful than here there is the 
same degree of family resemblance. 
The statistical statement of the likeness 
shown by sons to their fathers with regard to 
success in examinations for the degree of 
Bachelor of Arts in Oxford is then cited, 
together with Professor Karl Pearson’s 
measure of the resemblance with regard to 
psychical characters between brothers and 
sisters while at school. 
The question then arises whether this 
resemblance is really due to heredity or to 
similarity of environment, and it is shown by 
considering the sharp contrasts between mem- 
bers of the same family brought up in the 
same environment that the latter cannot be 
the only or even the more important factor. 
The results obtained by the methods of 
Experimental Psychology are then examined, 
and appear to support this conclusion. 
Finally, another line of reasoning is sug- 
gested—namely, that as mental capacity is 
largely the expression of physical characters, 
and as it may be supposed that all physical 
characters are inherited, it follows that 
mental capacity is probably inherited also.

TUBERCULOSIS, INSANITY, FEEBLE- 
MINDEDNESS, AND EPILEPSY CHAPTER VIII 
Or the many diseases in the causation of 
which heredity has been regarded as an 
important factor, there is none more common 
or more deadly than tuberculosis. No one 
disputes the fact that pulmonary phthisis or 
consumption, the form of tuberculosis that 
most frequently causes death, has a strong 
tendency to run in families, and up till the 
last part of the nineteenth century the medical 
profession attributed this to inheritance. 
When the tubercle bacillus was discovered, it 
became obvious that the disease itself was not 
inherited, and in consequence the opinions 
of physicians swung over to the opposite 
extreme, and now many, if not the majority, 
declare that infection is the only cause, that 
heredity plays no part whatever, and that 
consumption runs in families because if one 
member catches it the others get infected. 
The latter view has been widely accepted, 
because belief in it makes the prospect of 
entirely preventing the disease appear more 
hopeful, and the human mind is always ready 
to believe what it wants to believe. Indeed, 
while Charity is but moderately active, 
Faith and Hope seem to have run mad. It 
has even been asserted that it is useless to
-P-A-G-E-167
  EUGENICS 163 
build Sanatoria durable enough to last more 
than ten years, because in ten years’ time the 
Insurance Act will have abolished consumption. 
It is possible to take up an intermediate 
position’ between the old opinion and the 
new. One cannot maintain that there can be 
tuberculosis without infection, but various 
considerations may still be urged to support 
the view that different individuals have the 
power to resist it in different degrees, and that 
in consumptive families a lack of resisting power 
is transmitted from parents to children. 
That the tubercle bacillus is everywhere 
about us, and that comparatively few people 
entirely escape its attacks are facts now 
generally admitted. But the disease may 
occur in so slight a form that the person 
attacked recovers from it without being aware 
that anything has been wrong. Is it something 
in the man or something in the microbe that 
causes such differences in the severity of the 
disease? Professor Metchnikoff! says that it 
is something in the microbe. His theory is 
that there are some deadly and virulent 
strains of tubercle bacilli and others com- 
paratively inoffensive, and that if one has the 
good fortune to be attacked in one’s youth 
by the latter, one acquires the same kind of 
immunity against the former as vaccination 
gives one against smallpox. This may be 
true; it does not exclude the possibility that 
* Bedvock, January, 1913.
-P-A-G-E-168
  164 EUGENICS 
there is something innate in the man, planted 
there by inheritance, which is the cause of 
the effects described. 
Social conditions provide data for deter- 
mining the relative shares of heredity and 
infection in the production of consumptive 
families which are almost as easy to interpret 
as the results of a simple experiment. If it 
is argued that parents live with their children, 
and are therefore likely, if tubercular, to 
impart the disease to them, it must also be 
admitted that husbands live in as intimate 
association with their wives and are just as 
likely to infect them or to be infected by them. 
The environmental conditions, such as housing 
and ventilation, are the same in each case, 
and can therefore be disregarded; so that if 
heredity is a negligible factor, the correlation 
between husband and wife with regard to 
the presence or absence of consumption 
should be as high as that between parents 
and children. This is very far from being the 
ease. Whereas the correlation between 
parents and children for pulmonary tuber- 
culosis lies between ‘4 and °6,1 that between 
husband and wife lies between 0 and °3*, 
Even in the latter case not all of this

  EUGENICS 165 
ean be attributed to marital infection, as it 
may be partly due to assortative mating or 
the well-known tendency of like stocks to 
intermarry. This tendency, the influence of 
which varies from one class to another, is 
clearly shown in characters, in the causation 
of which infection plays no part. Thus the 
marital correlation for insanity among upper 
class families was found to be ‘8 (Pearson, 
Elderton), among the well-to-do and pros- 
perous poor ‘385 (Goring). Among the very 
poor and destitute it is nil (Goring); but in 
this class the correlation between husband 
and wife for consumption is also at its lowest. 
For physical characters generally, such as 
stature, the correlation between husband 
and wife in the well-to-do classes varies about 
the average value of 24. Further, in the same 
classes and districts positive correlation was 
found between the presence of tuberculosis 
in the wife’s family and in the husband’s. It 
thus is quite clear that some allowance must 
be made for assortative mating, and when this ~ 
has been made there is but little left to be 
attributed to infection. On the other hand, 
there is, as has been previously stated, 
a strong correlation between parents and 
children who have no greater opportunities 
for affecting one another. So the conclusion 
seems to follow inevitably that the correla- 
tion must be largely due to the inheritance of 
the tuberculous diathesis—that is to say. the
-P-A-G-E-170
  166 EUGENICS 
special liability to be infected with a serious 
form of the disease. 
Other arguments confirm this conclusion. 
Tuberculosis and certain types of insanity are 
often associated together. According to Dr 
Mott, the pathologist to the London County 
Asylums, ‘the death-rate from pulmonary 
tuberculosis for the insane between the ages 
of fifteen and thirty-five is about fifteen times 
that of the sane for the same age period.’ 
This difference cannot be attributed to infec- 
tion, because among the 1800 attendants in 
the asylums tuberculosis has been very rare, 
and if infection were the principal cause the 
disease would certainly be common among the 
attendants also. Nor can it be attributed to 
insanitary conditions such as bad air or bad 
food, because in these respects a high standard 
is maintained, and indeed the asylums are 
far healthier as places of residence than the 
homes from which the patients come. The 
only cause which can be assigned to it is some 
inborn defect of physical vitality which ren- 
ders lunatics of this description an easy prey 
to the ubiquitous tubercle bacillus in the same 
way as their minds through some inborn 
defect are unbalanced by the shocks and 
stresses commonly met with in life, and by 
events or habits which have little effect on 
persons of ordinary mental stability. 
That heredity plays an important part in 
the propagation of insanity itself is disputed
-P-A-G-E-171
  EUGENICS 167 
by few. It is easy to adduce facts to support 
it. For example, Dr Mott points out that 
among 20,000 patients in the London County 
Asylums, 725, or 8°6 per cent., have either 
a brother or sister, a parent or a child in the 
asylums. He argues that it cannot be sup- 
posed that if 20,000 people were picked at 
random from the classes which supply the 
asylum population so many would be so 
closely related: and therefore heredity must 
play a part in making the selection. 
Dr Heron,! making more precise calcula- 
tions from data which, though not very 
extensive, had been very carefully collected, 
estimates the correlation between parents 
and children to be between *45 and °55, which 
is approximately the same as that for physical 
characters such as stature. 
The examination of detailed pedigrees in 
addition to statistical considerations of in- 
sane stocks leaves little room for doubt 
concerning the inheritance of insanity. Yet 
it is as inaccurate to talk of the inheritance 
of insanity as the inheritance of tuberculosis, 
The immediate cause of the latter is the 
attack of a microbe, and of the former it 
may be one of the many incidents or acci- 
dents in the life of the insane person; but in 
the same way as those who are free from the 
tuberculous diathesis can repulse the attack 
1A Fivst Study of the Statistics of Insanity and the 
Inheritance of the Insane Diathesis.
-P-A-G-E-172
  168 EUGENICS 
‘without knowing that it has taken place, so 
those who are free from the insane diathesis 
can pass with mind unshaken and uncon- 
scious of any danger through all the crises of 
life, whether brought on by outside events or 
by the changes that occur in the body at 
certain special epochs. It should be noted 
that to speak of the definite presence or 
absence of the insane diathesis is incorrect, 
for the mental instability which is denoted by 
this term occurs in varying degrees. In some 
cases the mind is fairly stable, and then it 
takes much to unbalance it; in others a less 
severe strain is needed; while in others again 
it gives way at the first test. 
Of the crises which arise naturally in the 
normal life of the individual, puberty comes 
first in order, and takes its toll of the mentally 
unstable. The women who pass safely through 
this period are severely tested by child- 
bearing, and many fail. For both men and 
women, the climacteric, or the close of sexual 
life, is a time of danger, through which all who 
live to reach it must pass. Among abnormal 
conditions which have a disturbing influence, 
mental stress, whether sudden or prolonged, 
is one of the most important; it affects women 
more than men. Intemperance in alcohol, 
which is in many cases considered the 
principal factor in an attack of insanity, 
appears to send many more men than women 
into the asylums. The same is true of
-P-A-G-E-173
  EUGENICS 169 
injuries and accidents. The particular symp- 
toms by which the insanity manifests itself 
appear to depend partly on its cause, partly 
on the age at which it oceurs, and partly 
on the predisposition of the individual. 
That the last statement is true is indicated 
by the fact that particular forms of insanity 
appear to run in families. 
From the point of view of Eugenics, the 
most dangerous form is recurrent insanity. 
Patients suffering from it have sometimes 
had as many as twenty attacks; they have 
been admitted twenty times and more into the 
asylums, and each time, after a few months, 
discharged as ‘cured.’ In their sane inter- 
vals some of them have had many children. 
There is one case on record in which such a 
man has begotten six more of the same kind. 
General paralysis of the insane affords an 
exception to much of what has been said 
above. It is now recognised as a possible 
sequel to a particular contagious disease, 
and it occurs in no other way. There is no 
evidence that hereditary predisposition plays 
any part in its causation. 
The prevalence of insanity throughout the 
country is a matter of very serious import, 
and the fact that it has been increasing at 
a relatively higher rate than the population 
has given rise to much alarm in many 
quarters. But while the matter should not 
be put aside with careless optimism, there 
E H 
 
-P-A-G-E-174

are some reasons for the belief that much of 
the increase is apparent rather than real. 
These reasons which have been clearly stated 
by Dr Mott,! may be summarised as follows:— 
In the first place, the standard of sanity has 
been raised. In London particularly the 
special. schools for the feeble-minded serve 
as a collecting agency, and more or less 
harmless idiots who would formerly have lived 
at large are now confined in asylums. Further, 
the accommodation for lunatics has been 
doubled in the county of London during the 
last twelve years, and, in consequence, 
patients, who before that would have been 
discharged as cured to make room for urgent 
cases, are kept for longer in the asylums. 
Secondly, improved sanitation has had 
a marked influence in the death-rate in 
asylums. Where formerly large numbers of 
cases died young of tuberculosis and dysentery 
and pneumonia, a much smaller number do 
so now, and many of those who escape live 
to a fair age as chronic incurable cases. 
Thirdly, a number of aged people suffering 
from senile decay, who used in former years 
to live in workhouse infirmaries, are now 
certified as lunatics and sent to the asylums. 
The fact that the Government pays the 
guardians 4s. per week for each pauper

Relation to Insanity. Read before the Eugenics Gongress,

lunatic is an inducement to them to send 
them. 
Mental deficiency, or Amentia, is dis- 
tinguished from other forms of mental 
disease or deformity in being commonly 
congenital. It is defined by Dr Tredgold* 
as being ‘that state in which the mind has 
failed to reach normal development.’ As 
this definition raises the difficult question 
as to what is normal development, he gives 
as an amended form the following—Amentia 
is ‘a state of mental defect from birth, or 
from an early age, due to incomplete cerebral 
development, in consequence of which the 
person affected is unable to perform his 
duties as a member of society in the position 
of life to which he was born.’ 
Three degrees of Amentia are distinguished : 
Idiocy, Imbecility, and Feeble-mindedness. 
Idiots are persons ‘so deeply defective in 
mind from birth, or from an early age, that 
they are unable to guard themselves against 
common physical dangers.’ Imbeciles can 
do this, but cannot earn their living, while the 
feeble-minded can, under favourable circum- 
stances, become self-supporting, but cannot 
‘compete on equal terms with their normal 
fellows, or manage themselves or their affairs 
ith ordinary prudence.’ 
Tredgold estimates the number of mentally 
efective persons in England and Wales to 
1A. F. Tredgold, Mental Deficiency (Amentia). 1908.

be about four per thousand of. the whole 
community. Of these about ten per cent. 
are idiots, thirty per cent. imbeciles, and 
sixty per cent. feeble-minded. Both on 
account of their far greater numbers, and 
because they are free to conduct their own 
affairs in whatever manner pleases them, 
though unable to do so ‘with ordinary pru- 
dence,’ the feeble-minded constitute a | 
greater danger to the community than do 
the idiots or imbeciles. These, by reason of 
their greater incapacity, are for the most 
part under confinement or some control 
which prevents them from inflicting damage 
on themselves or others, or from propagating 
their like. 
From the feeble-minded the majority of 
the inmates of Inebriate Reformatories and 
a large proportion of the migratory popula- 
tion of prisons and ‘Rescue Homes’ are 
drawn. Educated at great expense to the 
community, while still young they are turned 
adrift into the world, and their instincts and 
appetites, which are often perverted and 
never less strong than those of normal people, 
lead them into temptations against which 
their mental equipment of judgment or self- 
control is wholly inadequate to guard them. 
Their natural defects are not such as to 
render them distasteful as mates either to) 
one another or to many of those who are} 
technically normal, neither are they usually]
-P-A-G-E-177
EUGENICS 178 
deficient in fertility; so through legitimate 
and illegitimate unions they add their quota 
to the ranks of those who are a blessing neither 
to themselves nor others. 
Owing to the fact that amentia is by 
definition a defect which is either congenital 
or arises very early in life, the influence of 
heredity as a factor in its causation is hardly 
open to question. That environmental con- 
ditions may sometimes be responsible is the 
extreme length to which those can go who 
would emphasise the importance of external 
factors, while preserving some regard for 
the truth. The environmental conditions 
must necessarily be those which operate 
_ either before, during, or immediately after 
birth. Among these, parental alcoholism is 
regarded by many as the most important. 
This has been thought to act either on the 
germplasm before conception, or directly on 
the unborn child during its prenatal life. 
A priori considerations might well lead one 
to believe that alcohol circulating in the 
mother’s blood and transfusing thence into 
the vessels of the child might well modify in 
a harmful manner the rapid process of growth 
and tissue differentiation which it is under- 
going, with the result that normal develop- 
ment of mind and body is prevented. It is 
also not incredible that a somewhat similar 
result might be obtained by the action of the 
alcohol in the germplasm itself. But direct 
   
-P-A-G-E-178
174 EUGENICS 
evidence of a convincing kind as to the exact 
effects of either of these supposed methods of 
action seems to be extremely difficult to 
obtain; although much sought, it has not 
yet been found. 
Of the other external conditions, injuries 
to the brain before, during, or after birth are 
probably in a small percentage of cases the 
cause of amentia. Tredgold says concerning 
such cases: ‘It is probable that rupture of 
vessels has taken place, leading to the destruc- 
tion of a localised area of brain tissue, and 
in most of these patients the amentia is 
accompanied by epilepsy or paralysis.’ 
Among the other factors, he attaches most 
weight to the action of acute infectious 
diseases occurring in infancy. 
But direct inheritance undoubtedly plays 
a far greater part in the production of feeble- 
mindedness than the sum total of contributing 
and alternative causes. Recent work carried 
out under the auspices of the American 
Eugenics Record Office! suggests that a 
Mendelian interpretation can be put upon 
the facts; indeed Dr Davenport and Dr 
Weeks appear to do so without doubt or 
hesitation, 
The basic hypothesis of these authors is, 
that for normal mental develpoment it is 
1C. B, Davenport and D. F. Weeks, A First Study 
on Inheritance in Epilepsy. D. F. Weeks, The Inheritance 
of Epilepsy, read before the Eugenics Congress, 1912.  
-P-A-G-E-179
  EUGENICS 175 
necessary that a particular determining 
factor should be present in the zygote. The 
factor is transmitted in a Mendelian way, 
and where it is absent epilepsy or feeble- 
mindedness appear. The simplex? individuals 
(whose zygotes contained the factor singly) 
may either appear normal or have an inter- 
mediate mental status, which renders them 
sometimes alcoholic, sometimes neurotic, and 
sometimes in some other way abnormal 
without being actually epileptic or feeble- 
minded. To be thoroughly normal one must 
be duplex and have the factor present twice 
over. If this hypothesis is correct,? the 
children produced by two feeble-minded 
parents, or by two epileptic parents, or when 
one is feeble-minded and the other epileptic, 
should all be tainted with one or other of these 
two defects. Where one is normal (duplex) 
and the other feeble-minded, the offspring 
should all be simplex and possess the ‘inter- 
mediate status,’ or appear normal. When 
both are simplex, one-quarter should be truly 
normal, one-quarter epileptic or feeble- 
minded, and the other half simplex. Simplex 
mated with normal should give one-half 
normal children and the other half simplex, 
and simplex mated with epileptic or feeble- 
minded. should give one-half simplex and the 
other half epileptic or feeble-minded. When 
1 For the Mendelian Theory, vide Chapter V. 
*It has recently been much modified by Dr. Davenport. 
 
-P-A-G-E-180
  176 EUGENICS 
both parents are normal (duplex) their 
children should all resemble them in this 
respect. 
The material analysed by Dr Weeks and 
Dr Davenport consisted of the pedigrees of 
inhabitants of the New Jersey State Village 
for Epileptics at Skillman. Their collection 
was an arduous and valuable piece of work, 
performed by Mrs Woodward and Miss Devitt 
of the Eugenics Record Office. The actual 
results obtained agree only just well enough 
with the expectation deduced from the 
suggested hypothesis to render the latter 
provisionally tenable. It is to be hoped that 
future work may confirm and extend it. 
Extension is necessary because the theory 
is incomplete—even if it should be eventually 
accepted without reserve—both as a true 
explanation of the facts and as a reliable 
guide for the prediction of the offspring to 
be expected from marriages in which one or 
more epileptics or feeble-minded persons are 
concerned. Its defect is that the two con- 
ditions which are very different in their 
symptoms, and may occur separately or in 
conjunction, are put into one class, and no 
account is taken of the degrees of severity in 
which each may be present. 
The difference between the theoretical 
expectation and the actual facts found con- 
sists principally in an excess of fecble-minded 
or epileptic children recorded in the pedigrees.
-P-A-G-E-181
  EUGENICS 177 
Dr Weeks endeavours to bring hypothesis 
and fact into better agreement by tenta- 
tively attributing this excess to parental 
alcoholism. 
The results of this research emphasises the 
importance of preventing, in whatever manner 
may be practicable without being harsh or 
unjust, the reproduction of epileptics and 
feeble-minded persons. Among the feeble- 
minded more than in any other class the 
tendency for like to mate with like must be 
a strong one, and where this occurs there 
seems little reason to suppose that healthy or 
normal offspring can be expected. Even 
where one mate is a normal the offspring are 
not completely so, so that when they in their 
turn form unions with others of their own 
class, three-quarters of their children may be 
to some extent defective. Such unions are 
not so unlikely to occur that their probable 
results can be looked on with equanimity. 
A fact of great importance, and one which 
tends to simplify the practical problems 
confronting the Eugenist, is that the harmful 
predispositions or inborn deficiencies dis- 
cussed in this chapter are apparently not 
independent one from another. A family in 
which one in common is less likely to be free 
from the others, and its members are often 
in other ways degenerate, being either 
addicted to alcohol, unable to earn a living, or 
prone to become vagabonds, prostitutes, 
 
-P-A-G-E-182
    178 EUGENICS 
or criminals. Thus by placing the feeble- 
minded under care of a kind which prevents 
them propagating, one would not only do 
something to exterminate feeble-mindedness, 
but one would at the same time be dealing 
a blow at tuberculosis, drunkenness, pauper- 
ism, prostitution, and criminality. 
There are many other defects, such as 
deaf-mutism and some forms of eye disease, 
which are hereditary in their nature, and 
place a serious handicap on those who suffer 
from them. In regard to all, the part played 
in their causation by the marriages of near 
kin has for many years aroused discussion. 
Public opinion has been generally set against 
marriages of first cousins, but little evidence 
has been recorded to support it. If the two 
cousins who marry are entirely free from 
latent defects, there does not seem to be any 
ground for supposing that their children are 
more likely to be defective than those of 
people unconnected by close kinship. But 
it is almost impossible to say definitely that 
no latent defect is present. Where the same 
abnormality exists in the germplasm of both 
partners, it is more likely that their children 
will be affected, than if the defect present on 
the one side is different to that on the other. 
The latent characters of cousins are much 
more likely to be similar than those of two 
unrelated persons, so it follows that, on the 
whole, it is safer for cousins not to inter-
-P-A-G-E-183
  EUGENICS 179 
marry. This conclusion can be more strongly 
insisted on when the presence of some par- 
ticular latent defect is suspected. 
SUMMARY OF CHAPTER 
It is generally admitted that tuberculosis 
tends to run in particular families. This was 
formerly attributed entirely to heredity, but 
now many people say that it is due entirely 
to infection. There is some evidence that it 
is due to the infection of persons who have 
been provided through inheritance with a 
very low power of resistance against the 
attacks of the microbes which cause the 
disease. Parents are as likely to infect one 
another as to infect their children, yet the 
correlation between parents and children is 
undoubtedly much higher than between 
husband and wife. The inheritance of the 
tubercular diathesis is the most reasonable 
explanation of the difference. 
Insanity is also caused partly by the 
external conditions and partly by the natural 
tendency, and in this case there is little doubt 
that the tendency is inherited. 
In the causation of mental deficiency or 
amentia, the environment acting directly on 
the individual probably plays a smaller part 
than in tuberculosis or insanity, because 
amentia is congenital, or is set up very 
soon after birth. Its hereditary nature is 
therefore more obvious, and the work of
-P-A-G-E-184
  180 EUGENICS 
Dr Davenport and Dr Weeks shows that 
feeble-mindedness and epilepsy may perhaps 
be inherited in a Mendelian way. 
Some of the problems in Eugenics are 
simplified by reason of the fact that all these 
defects and some others tend to occur in the 
same stocks. 
Lastly, the view now generally accepted as 
to the dangers of marriages between cousins 
is discussed. 
CHAPTER IX 
THE INFLUENCE OF THE ENVIRONMENT 
Every part of any human body, whether it 
be an organ present in all mankind or the 
peculiarity of one or a few individuals, every 
habit of body or mind, every form of skill, 
every faculty and every disease is guided in its 
develpoment directly or indirectly by the 
nature of the germplasm and by the external 
conditions through which the individual is 
passing or has passed. If some characters, 
such as the colour of the eyes, appear to be 
wholly unaffected by the environment, it 
is because the external conditions which 
permit their development are so varied as 
to include almost all those in which life itself 
is possible. If others, such as a scar on the 
cheek, appear to depend wholly on external 
influence, it is because they are represented
-P-A-G-E-185
  EUGENICS 181 
potentially in every zygote, but actually 
develop only under certain well-marked 
conditions. 
The joint action of nature and nurture is 
obvious in most cases, and in many it is 
difficult to say to which should be attri- 
buted the preponderant influence. Galton’s 
classical study of the resemblances and 
differences exhibited by twins was an 
attempt to find a general solution of this 
problem. By assiduous correspondence he 
collected much information concerning a 
hundred pairs of twins, and he found that 
they fell naturally into two discontinuous? 
groups according to the degree of likeness 
between the members of a pair. In the one, 
each twin resembled its fellow very closely 
from infancy upwards in a great many ways, 
and the two were always of the same sex. 
In the second the sex was sometimes the same 
and sometimes different, and there were often 
remarkable contrasts in body and mind. 
The twins of both groups were naturally 
exposed as they grew up and went out into 
the world to conditions which, from being 
almost identical, became more and more 
different. Of those who showed so great a 
resemblance in early childhood some diverged 
to a certain extent from one another, but 
1Groups are called discontinuous when they dg not 
shade by insensible gradations into one another, «wt 
are quite distinct. 
 
-P-A-G-E-186
Mr oe Se ee ee Per ee ee eee ER ee eee 
182 EUGENICS 
others maintained a close similarity through- 
out life—a similarity which often extended 
from personal appearance to mental charac- 
teristics and to the liability to various diseases. 
Galton sums this up as follows :—‘We have 
seen. that a few twins retain their close 
resemblance through life; in other words, 
instances do exist of an apparently thorough 
similarity of nature, in which such difference 
of external circumstances as may be consistent 
with the ordinary conditions of the same 
social rank and country do not create dis- 
similarity. Positive evidence such as this 
cannot be outweighed by any amount of 
negative evidence.’ Even the divergence 
which occurred in some cases is not neces- 
sarily entirely the result of external condi- 
tions; it may be due to some extent to innate 
differences manifesting themselves late in life. 
If the action of the environment were very 
powerful, it should be clearly shown in the 
case of the dissimilar twins, by their becoming 
more and more alike, when exposed during 
childhood to almost identical conditions. 
That this was far from happening is shown by 
the collected evidence, of which the following 
is a sample :—‘One parent says: “They have 
had exactly the same nurture from their 
birth up to the present time; they are both 
perfectly healthy and strong, yet they are 
otherwise as dissimilar as two boys could be, 
physically, mentally, and in their emotional 
   
-P-A-G-E-187
EUGENICS 188 
nature.” » According to another parent, the 
twins are “Very :dissimilar in body and 
mind: the one is quiet, retiring, and slow 
but sure; good-tempered, but disposed to be 
sulky when provoked ;—the other is quick, 
vivacious, forward, acquiring easily and for- 
getting soon; quick-tempered and choleric, 
but quickly forgiving and forgetting. They 
have been educated together and never 
separated.” ’ 
There is much more to the same effect, 
but this is sufficient to support the argument, 
which may be briefly recapitulated as follows :— 
The twins who were similar in childhood 
remained in many cases very much alike in 
after life, although exposed to different 
conditions. Those who were different to start 
with remained different, although subject 
in childhood to almost identical conditions. 
Therefore nurture failed in the one case to 
make different people who were similar by 
nature, and in the other to make similar 
people who were by nature different. It 
follows that nurture is sometimes at any rate 
less powerful than nature. 
It is profitable to turn from a rather general 
treatment of the question such as js given 
above to detailed studies of particular points. 
Of these, two of the most important have 
1The argument will be recognised as taat used by 
Dr Woods many years later in discussing heredity in 
poral personages. It is quoted in Chapter VII. of this

184 EUGENICS 
been made respectively by Professor Karl 
Pearson, with Miss Barrington, and by Dr 
David Heron. They are both published 
among the memoirs of the Galton Eugenics 
Laboratory. Professor Pearson and Miss 
Barrington deal with the inheritance of vision 
and the relative influence of heredity and 
environment in sight. Their work consists 
essentially of two parts. In the first, statistical 
measures of resemblance between parents 
and children, and between children of the 
same parents, are obtained for various of the 
commoner defects of vision. In the second, 
the correlation between the home environ- 
ment of school children and the state of their 
eyesight is estimated. 
Basing the first part of their work largely 
on records made by the Swiss oculist, Dr 
Adolf Steiger, they found a high degree of 
correlation between parents and children, 
with regard to the degree of development of 
corneal astigmatism and refractive errors. 
When dealing with pairs of brothers or sisters, 
well-marked similarity in the condition of the 
eyesight was found also, and the results 
obtained from Steiger’s material were cor- 
roborated by much which came from quite 
other sources. The actual value of the 
correlation coefficients which express the 
degrees of eee referred to above are 
not given here. The subject is one of so much 
difficulty that the whole process of reasoning
-P-A-G-E-189
  im EUGENICS 185 
by which the final values are obtained is too 
elaborate to be conveniently summarised. 
It is enough to say that there is ample justifi- 
cation for the conclusion that the ‘physical 
characters of the eye are hereditary qualities,’ 
and some basis for the further assertion ‘that 
the intensity of inheritance is probably 
exactly the same as that for other physical 
characteristics in man.” 
The study of pedigrees confirms the general 
conclusion that the condition of the eyes is 
apt to be inherited, and shows that the in- 
heritance of some of the rarer defects is 
Mendelian in its nature. 
Professor Pearson and Miss Barrington 
_ used for the second part of their work the 
  Report on the physical condition of fourteen 
hundred school children in the city (of 
Edinburgh), with some account of their 
homes and surroundings, published by the 
Edinburgh Charity Organisation Society. The 
home environment of these children was 
classified—first, according to the number of 
people per room; secondly, according to the 
economic conditions, judged by particulars 
as to wages earned and such other facts as 
would enable one to form an opinion as to 
how poor they were; thirdly, as to whether 
the parents were in good physical condition 
or bad; and fourthly, according to the moral 
condition of the parents, judged by such 
particulars as were available. 
 
-P-A-G-E-190
  186 ‘EUGENICS 
The eyesight of the children was classified 
according to its keenness, or to what refrac- 
tive faults, if any, were present. But what- 
ever classification was adopted, either of the 
homes or of the children, it was never found 
that defective sight was associated more 
with a bad environment than with a good.! 
In this case at any rate, then, ‘Nature’ 
plays a larger part than ‘Nurture,’ as repre- 
sented by such home conditions as were 
investigated. The authors of the memoir 
further discuss the theory that school is 
the principal cause of near sight or myopia. 
This theory rests largely on certain statistics 
of the German oculist Cohn, which show that 
the degree of myopia among school children 
increases with the length of time for which 
they are at school. Working with Cohn’s 
data, Professor Pearson and Miss Barrington 
‘found that the coefficient of correlation 
between this defect and the length of school 
life was :244. This might at first sight appear 
to be a demonstration of the theory; but, 
they argue, it is well known that, quite apart 
from school life, children grow more short- 
sighted as they grow up, and it must be the 
case that the children who have been longest 
1It is possible that a good home environment and 
a bad, each in different ways, have a harmful effect on 
the eyesight. In the former, the children would be likely 
to stay indoors more and read, or otherwise employ 
their eyes on close work; in the latter, by poor nutrition, 
bad air, and so on,
-P-A-G-E-191
EUGENICS 187 
at school will generally be the older ones. 
Therefore the increase in the defect apparently 
due to school life is due really to increasing 
age: To test this, using the same data, they 
calculated the coefficient correlation between 
degree of myopia and age, and found it to be 
‘331, thus showing that it is age which plays 
the predominant part. 
Dr Heron’s work on the Influence of 
Defective Physique and Unfavourable Home 
Environment on the Intelligence of School 
Children is based on a survey of the children 
in fourteen L.C.C. schools, which was set on 
foot by Dr Kerr, the medical officer of the 
Education Committee. 
The children were divided by the teachers 
in each of the schools into five different cate- 
gories of Mental Capacity. One of the chief 
difficulties in the work was caused by the 
manner in which this grading was done. In 
one school a third of the number of the boys 
and girls were classed as brilliant, and in 
another a thirtieth. It is obvious that in 
the former the word must have been used in 
a sense very different to that in which one 
is accustomed to use it, and, what is more to 
the point, very different from that in which it 
was used in the latter. In order to get over 
the difficulty thus introduced, it was necessary 
to do the statistical calculations for each 
school separately. The other characters which 
were measured or estimated in one way or 
 
-P-A-G-E-192
  188 EUGENICS 
another and correlated with intelligence were 
weight and height, condition of clothing and 
teeth, state of nutrition, cleanliness, and the 
condition of the cervical glands, tonsils, and 
adenoids, and the power of hearing. But from 
the results obtained it could not be shown 
that mental capacity depended to any appreci- 
able extent on any of the other characters 
dealt with. The character most closely 
associated with intelligence was the state of 
the clothing in girls. The brighter girls were 
undoubtedly better dressed than the rest; 
but, taking the other facts into consideration, 
it is more reasonable to suppose that their 
comparatively tidy and well-kept costumes 
were due to their greater cleverness than that 
both were the result of their coming from 
better homes. In boys, mental superiority 
exhibited itself more markedly in personal 
cleanliness than in the state of their garments. 
But the relation was not such a close one as 
between clothing and intelligence in girls. 
It cannot be claimed that the researches 
which have been briefly described go far to 
settle the general question as to the relative 
influence of nature and nurture. That is 
a problem for which no general solution can 
be found. They do not even go far towards 
answering the more particular questions as 
to how far the state of the eyesight and the 
intelligence of children depend on the con- 
ditions under which they are brought. up, 
 
-P-A-G-E-193
EUGENICS 189 
Conditions not dealt with in the memoirs 
- sale may have a far greater influence than 
those which have been investigated; but even 
if this is the case, the authors cannot be 
blamed for it, as the limitations of their 
material hemmed them in at all points. On 
the other hand, the great merit is theirs of 
leading the way in the application of exact 
statistical methods to these difficult problems, 
as well as of obtaining results which are 
themselves of some considerable value as 
far as they go. The relatively quick and 
certain method of direct experiment is not 
available for the study of mankind, so the 
investigator must rely either on statistics or 
on arguments from analogy. By statistics 
rightly applied he may cut his way through 
the thick jungle of confusing details, over- 
shadowed and obscured by ignorance and 
prejudice, and, moving laboriously step by 
step, at last map out the features of the un- 
known land. But quick progress under 
these conditions must not be expected from 
him, and some false starts are almost inevi- 
table. 
There are one or two fields in which there 
is some general experience of the effects of 
nurture, and these must be examined before 
leaving the subject. It is well known that by 
developing a group of muscles with special 
exercises they grow stronger and larger, but 
they do not go on increasing indefinitely; 
   
-P-A-G-E-194
  190 EUGENICS 
after a.time a. point is reached.at which. all 
that exercise can do is to keep them in con- 
dition. Similarly with regard to skill of some 
particular kind, like that required for playing 
golf; a point is reached at which further im- 
provement seems impossible, even with the 
best of tuition and all the practice that is 
good for one. After a time even the best 
professional comes to a standstill; his drives 
do not become straighter or longer, or his 
mashie shots more accurate. With race-horses 
a corresponding limit is reached; training 
appears to make an enormous difference up 
to a certain point, but beyond that point is 
powerless to increase their speed. A parallel 
case is found in the candidates for an examina- 
tion leading to some valuable prize—for 
instance, the Civil Service. They may not 
all be crammed to quite the same degree, but 
many of them have been trained to the 
limit; yet the marks show the most enormous 
differences between the first few candidates. 
Similarly among race-horses, some descend 
to the cab rank, while others may earn an 
annual income about double that of a cabinet 
minister. Professional golfers are constantly 
competing one against the other, both in the 
open championship and in other competitions, 
yet one or two may head the list again and 
again; and finally, among those who practise 
the cult of the dumb-bell to an equal extent 
some acquire the muscular development of
-P-A-G-E-195
  
EUGENICS 191 
a Sandow, while otliers retain the proportions 
of ordinary mortals. 
All these cases:show that nurture has some 
power to mould the individual, but that nature 
says the last word. They all exaggerate the 
apparent effect of nurture in the following 
way. When one sees the feats performed by 
the highly trained man or beast, one is apt 
to compare them with the achievements of 
the untrained and attribute the difference 
to training, yet training is only given to the 
naturally apt, so the difference must be 
largely due in reality to the natural aptitude. 
From a consideration of racial stature 
limits, the same sort of conclusions may be 
drawn. There is hardly a doubt that stature 
is influenced by good and bad conditions; 
but the average stature of races living under 
conditions not markedly different may be 
very great. 
The point need not be laboured further. 
Galton illumines the question of ‘nature and 
nurture’ with the following parable, which 
contains a large measure of truth :—‘Many 
a person has amused himself with throwing 
bits of stick into a tiny brook and watching 
their progress; how they are arrested, first 
by one chance obstacle then by another; 
and again, how their onward course is facili- 
tated by a combination of circumstances. 
He might ascribe much importance to each 
of these events and think how largely the  
-P-A-G-E-196
    192 EUGENICS 
destiny of the stick has been governed by 
a series of trifling accidents. Nevertheless, 
all the sticks succeed in passing down the 
current, and in the long run they travel at 
nearly the same rate. So it is with life in 
respect to the several accidents which seem 
to have a great effect on our careers. The one 
element which varies in different individuals, 
but is constant in each of them, is the natural 
tendency; it corresponds to the current in 
the stream, and invariably asserts itself.’ 
If it is difficult to tell how much influence 
on the individual may be exercised by the 
environment acting on him directly during” 
his lifetime, it is much harder to estimate 
what may have been its action previous to 
his birth. The latter is a problem with three 
main divisions, each quite distinct from the 
others. In considering what these are, one 
must bear clearly in mind the distinction 
drawn between the soma or body and the 
germplasm which lives, as it were like a 
guest, within the body. It will be remembered 
that each individual (vide Chapter V.) is 
formed from a zygote made up by a portion 
of the germplasm contained in each parent, 
and that early in the development of the 
zygote a certain part of the germplasm is set 
aside unchanged with regard to its essential 
nature; from this the gametes are formed 
from which the next generation springs, 
while the rest controls the growth and
-P-A-G-E-197
  EUGENICS 193 
differentiation of the various parts of the 
body or soma. 
Now the first question is: Can any changes 
produced in the soma of a parent by accident, 
by the special exercise of any particular 
organ, or through any of the other channels 
through which the environment may act on 
the individual, so influence the germplasm 
from which the offspring of that particular 
parent will be partly derived, that the same 
changes will reappear in it? In other words, 
are mutilations, the effects of disease or of 
use or disuse, of climate or nutrition, and 
so on, inherited? 
The second question is: Can the environ- 
ment act on the germplasm directly or through 
the medium of the parental soma so as to 
change it in such a way that the soma of the 
offspring develops in a different manner to 
that in which it otherwise would? The 
difference between the two questions can be 
illustrated by reference to a special case. 
Suppose a man, in consequence of habitual 
drunkenness, to develop cirrhosis of the liver, 
and afterwards to have children. If the first 
question could be answered in the affirmative, 
his children would have a good chance of 
developing cirrhosis of the liver without 
drinking at all. If, on the other hand, it 
must be answered in the negative, then they 
would be no more likely to suffer from the 
disease than if their father had been a 
RB I 
 
-P-A-G-E-198
194 EUGENICS 
teetotaller. If the second question is stated in 
the terms of this special case, it would run 
more or less as follows :—Can the alcohol 
circulating in the father’s veins and thus 
penetrating to all parts of the body poison 
the germplasm in such a manner that when 
the paternal gamete fertilises the maternal 
the zygote is not able to develop quite nor- 
mally, and some defect of mind or body in 
the offspring results? 
The third question deals with the influences 
acting on the individual in his prenatal life. 
To what extent will his chances in life be 
affected by the acts, habits, and cireumstances 
‘of his mother during her pregnancy? 
The first question may be dismissed very 
briefly. The bulk of scientific opinion is so 
opposed to the idea that modifications pro- 
duced in the parental soma by the action of 
the environment can be inherited, and the 
evidence in favour collected up to the present 
is so slight and so much open to criticism that 
a negative answer may be given with as 
much certainty as can be attained in questions 
of this kind. 
Such a definite opinion cannot be expressed 
with regard to the action of the environment 
on the germplasm. Some of the more strenu- 
ous temperance reformers have collected 
data from which they deduce arguments to 
show that the germplasm may be poisoned by 
alcohol, in such a way that the children of 
   
-P-A-G-E-199
  EUGENICS 195 
intemperate parents are more likely to be 
feeble-minded or lacking in bodily vigour 
than they would have been if the parents had 
been more moderate. Others go even further, 
and assert that even moderate and abstemious 
consumers of alcoholic beverages exercise by 
these habits a deleterious influence on their 
children. What they say may be true or it 
may not; but when the reasoning on which 
the assertions are made is subjected to a 
critical examination! so many fallacies can 
be detected in it, that no weight whatever 
can be attached to the conclusions. The 
cause of tempérance rests on so firm a basis 
that it cannot be permanently damaged by 
any form of mis-statement; but if one thing 
rather than another tends to weaken it, it 
is the emphatic but unproved assertion of 
some of its more zealous supporters, that 
parental alcoholism, through its action on 
the germplasm, is the direct cause of feeble- 
mindedness, insanity, and degeneration of 
various kinds in the offspring. The general 
question, if not the specific influence of 
alcohol, can be more profitably studied by 
experiments on the lower animals. By well- 
devised experiments it is always easier to

Pearson and Miss Elderton’s Second Study of the Influence 
of Parental Alcoholism on the Physique and Ability of the 
Yfspring. Eugenics Laboratory Memoirs XIII. The 
ler interested in the question is referred to this memoir, 
which, he will see, is impossible to analyse satisfactorily 
in this volume.
-P-A-G-E-200
  196 EUGENICS 
obtain a definite answer more quickly than 
by the observation of very complicated 
phenomena. And though a completely open 
mind may be as rare among scientists as 
among politicians or social reformers, yet 
the affairs of mice and beetles are less apt to 
be misinterpreted through prejudice or 
Jesuitically misrepresented than those of 
the human species. 
Of the results obtained experimentally, 
those of Professor Tower on a small beetle, 
called Leptinotarsa, are — enough to be 
worth quoting. He first was careful to find 
out by inbreeding and cross-breeding that he 
was dealing with a stable species, which nor- 
mally produced its like and had not latent 
in it any particular variations. Several 
mature specimens derived from the same 
stock were then subjected to different con- 
ditions of heat and cold and moisture. As 
the colour and pattern is fully developed by 
the time maturity is reached, external con- 
ditions acting afterwards are unable to change 
it. The beetles themselves, therefore, showed 
no sign of change, but the germplasm within 
had nevertheless been modi In conse- 
quence of this, the young beetles whose 
parents had been exposed to heat and 
drought were markedly paler in colour than 
were their parents. The pallor was no indica- 
tion that they were deficient in vitality; 
they were just as healthy as the rest. The
-P-A-G-E-201
  EUGENICS 197 
germplasm had been altered in some unknown 
way, so that less external pigment was 
developed, and the alteration was apparently 
a permanent one. When the pale young 
beetles themselves reached maturity they 
were bred together and produced offspring 
like themselves, and so long as the experi- 
ment was continued the paleness was exhibited 
in each succeeding generation. 
Many other varieties of offspring were 
produced by the action on the parent form 
of different external conditions, and these, 
when produced, bred true in the same way 
as the pale ones. The amount of pigment was 
not the only thing affected, but the pattern 
in which it was arranged was in some cases 
altered also. 
The experiments as far as they go are 
probably the most certain indication hitherto 
afforded that the germplasm, apart from the 
soma, can be permanently modified by the 
action of the environment. But few biologists 
would accept them as a proof that it normally 
is so affected. Until a great deal more definite 
evidence has been collected it would be 
unsafe to give as decided an answer to this 
question as was given to that concerning 
the inheritance of somatic modifications. 
The other division of the problem—namely, 
the inquiry into the effects produced on the 
child during intra-uterine life by the acts and 
habits and condition of its mother, is an  
-P-A-G-E-202
    198 EUGENICS 
important branch of the science of Eugenics. 
It is, however, too purely a medical question 
for discussion here. 
There are certain other special circumstances 
acting before the birth of an individual 
which it is, or has been thought, determine 
his nature to some extent or in some way. 
Among these may be classed his birth rank 
among his brothers and sisters. Are the first- 
born and second-born members of a family 
likely to be better or worse in any respect 
than those born later, and what peculiarities, 
if any, distinguish the last few members of 
a large family? Professor Pearson’s answer 
to the first part of the question is—that the 
first and second born children are more 
likely than the rest to be tuberculous, neu- 
rotic, insane, or to have criminal tendencies. 
If this is true, then the reduction in the size 
of families which is now taking place will 
have a directly harmful action on the race, 
apart from any effect which it may produce 
by selecting for reproduction the worse stocks 
rather than the better, since in small families 
a larger percentage of members are neces- 
sarily first-born or second-born than in 
large. 
The type of evidence on which Professor 
Pearson’s contention rests is as follows :— 
The Crossley Sanatorium at Frodsham is 
filled with lower middle-class and working- 
class patients suffering from consumption,
-P-A-G-E-203
  
EUGENICS 199 
who come mostly from Manchester and, to 
a lesser degree, from Liverpool and its neigh- 
bourhood. From the records kept of the 
family histories of the patients it is possible 
to tell how many came in each particular 
place in their families. It was then found 
that of 881 patients, 118 were first-born, and 
79 second-born. When the patients and all 
their brothers and sisters, living or dead, 
are taken together, it was found that in the 
881 families there were 881 first-born and 
866 second-born. Dividing these numbers by 
the average number of children per family, 
one arrives at the number of first-born and 
second-born, which, according to the theory 
of probability, one would expect to find in 
a sample made up by picking one child at 
random from each family. The numbers are 
67 and 64. The 381 Sanatorium patients 
may be regarded as a sample selected by 
consumption, one from each family, and 
among them the corresponding numbers are 
118 and 79—that is to say, about 1? times as 
many first-born and 1} times as many second- 
born, as in the random sample of the same 
size. As the differences are too large to be 
due to chance, they appear to show that con- 
sumption does not pick at random, but selects 
more particularly the first-born and the 
second-born. With regard to the third and 
later born members the differences were 
| reversed, there being fewer of these among
-P-A-G-E-204
  200 EUGENICS 
the patients than would be the expectation 
if the latter were drawn by chance, one from 
each family. 
An examination of the families of criminal 
and insane persons gives a concordant result, 
but before attributing it to any mysterious 
inferiority on the part of the first and second 
born, it is necessary to consider the possi- 
bility of its being due to some quite common- 
place and easily intelligible cause. Two such 
causes have been suggested. The first is that 
infant mortality is highest among the later 
born members of a family, particularly in 
the classes from which the patients at the 
Crossley Sanatorium and the criminals and 
lunatics dealt with were drawn. In conse- 
quence of this, among those children who 
survive infancy the first and second born 
will be more numerous than among the whole 
number of children. It is necessary to survive 
infancy in order to be eligible for sanatorium 
treatment or to become a criminal or a 
lunatic. Thus, if the tuberculous patients, 
criminals, and lunatics were drawn quite at 
random from those members of the family 
who survived infancy, we would expect to 
find among them an excess of first and second 
born. The other cause is suggested by Dr 
Ploetz? in the following words :—‘ Among 
the children of a number of marriages taken 
1Dr Alfred Ploetz, Neo-Malthusianism and Race 
Hygiene. Read before the Eugenics Congress, 1912.
-P-A-G-E-205
  EUGENICS 201 
at random, there are a good many children 
of parents who died early, consequently there 
is a high proportion of children who represent 
early members in birth rank, and principally 
first, second, and third born. Because of the 
death of one or both parents there could be 
no later born. First, second, and third born 
children, therefore, come in a far greater 
percentage from early deceased, that is on 
the average weaker parents, than do the 
later born, and they will therefore inherit 
in a higher degree the weaker constitution 
of their weaker parents.’ 
It is easier to believe in the truth of these 
two explanations than to accept as fact the 
view that in ordinary families the later born 
children are mentally and organically of 
sounder constitution than the earlier born. 
The evidence on which the assertion is 
based, that infant mortality is highest among 
the later born members of a family is dis- 
cussed by Dr Ploetz in the paper quoted. In 
a group of unselected lower-class marriages 
analysed by Geissler, which gave rise to 
26,000 births, among the first four children of 
each marriage the percentage who died 
during the first year of life fell between 
twenty to twenty-three, for the fifth-born 
it was twenty-six, and it rose steadily after 
this point, so that sixty per cent. of the 
twelfth-born did not survive for one year. 
Dr Ploetz expresses the opinion that excessive 
.
-P-A-G-E-206
  202 EUGENICS 
mortality among the later born is due largely 
to the fact that in a poor home where the 
family has become large the economic con- 
ditions grow worse, and such children as 
are born receive less attention and care than 
when the family was smaller. Among royal 
families where, presumably, the conditions 
are the best possible for all the children, 
there is no noticeable difference in mortality 
among the first nine. 
If all the facts are taken together, the 
safest conclusion to draw seems to be that 
children are not directly affected to any 
marked extent by their place in order of birth. 
Two other environmental agencies, accord- 
ing to popular belief, may determine or 
modify innate characters. These are ‘Tele- 
gony’ and ‘Maternal Impressions.’1 The 
theory of telegony, if applied to mankind, 
would mean that if a woman had a child 
by one husband and subsequently another 
child by another husband, the peculiarities of 
the first husband would exert an influence, 
not only on his own child but on the other 
man’s. The supposed instances are for the 
most part derived from the breeding of 
animals, and are largely due to mistakes in 
the records of parentage. A scientific breeder 
of fowls, on whose well-ordered farm telegony 
was unknown, has defined it when exhibited 
~ 1 Professor J. A. Thomson includes in his Heredity an 
interesting discussion of these theories.
-P-A-G-E-207
  EUGENICS 208 
by hens as ‘she flew over the fence.’ The 
definition is rich in meaning though pvor in 
syntax. If one supposes that she flew over 
in secrecy in order to consort with a previous 
and preferable mate and then flew back again, 
we can well understand how a ‘clear case’ 
may have arisen. 
Although not all the better authenticated 
instances are of this kind, other explanations 
which accord better than telegony with 
generally accepted biological views are in- 
variably forthcoming, and one may be fairly 
safe in asserting that the Eugenist may 
disregard the possibility of the environment 
acting for good or evil through this medium. 
Of the theory of ‘Maternal Impressions,’ 
early mention is made in the Bible. The 
story is told in the thirtieth chapter of 
Genesis, how Laban and his son-in-law Jacob 
agreed that the latter’s wages should be ‘all 
the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the 
brown cattle among the sheep, and the 
spotted and speckled among the goats.’ 
But before Jacob could get possession of any 
of them, Laban picked out from among his 
flocks and herds every beast that answered 
to this description and gave them to his 
own sons. So ‘Jacob took him of rods of 
green poplar, and of the hazel and chestnut 
tree, and pilled white strakes in them, and 
made the white appear which was in the rods. 
And he set the rods which he had pilled before 
 
-P-A-G-E-208
  
204 EUGENICS 
the flocks in the gutters in the watering- 
troughs when the flocks came to drink, that 
they should conceive when they came to 
drink. And the flocks conceived before the 
rods, and brought forth cattle ringstraked, 
speckled, and spotted.’ Jacob separated out 
this lot for his own portion, and afterwards, 
‘whensoever the stronger cattle did con- 
ceive,’ he laid them before the rods, so that 
their offspring should be his, while the 
remainder he left to Laban. 
At the time when this narrative was written, 
the belief that animals would resemble some 
object placed conspicuously before their 
mothers during pregnancy must have been 
a common one, as the story is told without 
comment or any suggestion that something 
unusual had happened. At the present day 
the belief is still common, but it is held more 
with regard to human beings than to other 
animals. Fresh instances are constantly 
being reported and talked of in which a woman 
with child either lets her mind dwell on some 
object, or else receives some violent emotional 
shock from seeing something which startles 
or frightens her, with the result that her child 
when born has some points of resemblance 
to the object which has been in her mind. 
Hearsay reports of a kind quite inadmissible 
as evidence are usually the only warrant for 
such stories; but in those cases in which it 
is possible to get an authentic account of the
-P-A-G-E-209
  EUGENICS 205 
facts, it is generally found that the resemblance 
noted is of the most slender description and 
easily explicable on the assumption that it 
is due to coincidence. The number of children 
who are born every day is very large, and 
their mothers in the months before they are 
born are particularly liable to receive shocks 
and frights from events which would not 
otherwise disturb them much. Under these 
circumstances it is nothing to be wondered at 
that every now and then a child should be 
born with some birth-mark or common defect 
which suggests the cause of the shock, or of 
one of the shocks, to which its mother has 
been subjected during her pregnancy. It 
should also be remembered that a particularly 
strong and protracted emotional experience 
of the mother may well have some effect on 
the nutrition of the child, as it depends for 
this on her circulatory system, which is very 
readily influenced by emotional disturbances. 
It is therefore possible that certain stigmata 
which are often reported to be due to ‘mater- 
nal impressions’ are in reality due to defective 
nourishment before birth. 
In the present state of our knowledge it 
would not be far wrong to say that ‘maternal 
impressions’ are exceedingly unlikely to 
influence the characters of the human race, 
either for good or ill, by impressing on 
children still unborn the likeness of the 
objects which caused them.

SUMMARY OF CHAPTER 
Some observations and inferences are 
brought forward which appear to show that 
‘nature’ has a wider range of influence than 
‘nurture’ in determining the development of 
the individual. For example, Galton found 
that those pairs of twins who were in early 
childhood closely similar to one another 
often retained the similarity even when 
exposed after childhood to different conditions 
of life; on the other hand, those who early 
showed contrasts, when brought up under 
almost identical conditions in childhood, did 
not grow more alike. 
Professor Pearson and Miss Barrington, by 
statistical methods, have shown that the 
condition of the eyesight is determined ts 
a large extent by heredity, and is not adversely 
affected in children by bad home conditions. 
Dr Heron found that intelligence in school 
children also seems almost unaffected by 
defective physique or an unfavourable home 
environment. Somemattersof common know- 
ledge are mentioned, which seem to indicate 
that the effect of the environment of any indi- 
vidual is strictly limited by his natural capacity. 
The various ways in which outside influences 
acting before the birth of an individual may 
affect him are next discussed. Some of 
Tower’s experiments on beetles are briefly 
described to show the possibility of the
-P-A-G-E-211
EUGENICS 207 
germplasm being permanently altered by 
external conditions. Doubt is expressed 
concerning the poisoning of the germplasm 
by parental alcoholism; the greater liability 
of first-born and second-born members of 
families to become tuberculous, insane, or 
criminal; ‘Telegony’ and the theory of 
‘Maternal Impressions.’ 
CHAPTER X 
THE SELECTIVE AGENCIES 
A.—The Differential Birth-rate and the 
Death-rate 
Tue Selective Agencies which may improve 
or impair the inborn qualities of future 
generations either physically or mentally are 
those which cause a relatively rapid increase 
or decrease in the numbers of particular 
nations, races, or classes, or of the possessors of 
some definite good or evil quality. All 
such agencies must act by establishing, 
directly or indirectly, a differential birth- 
rate or a differential death-rate. Their study 
may be approached most conveniently by 
considering and comparing the action of the 
birth-rate and the death-rate. 
The birth-rate and the death-rate are 
usually stated, by those who deal in vital 
statistics, as so and so many per thousand 
per annum. If the population of a country
-P-A-G-E-212
  208 EUGENICS 
in a given year numbered twenty million 
persons, and half a million births were 
registered during the year, the birth-rate 
for that year would be twenty-five per 
thousand, and if the deaths recorded were 
half as numerous as the births, the death- 
rate would be 12°5 per thousand. The rate 
of natural increase in a country is the amount 
by which the birth-rate exceeds the death- 
rate; it is different to the actual increase, 
for the latter is affected also by immigration 
and emigration. 
In estimating the proportionate extent to 
which different nations are contributing to 
the population of the world it is simplest to 
consider the rate of natural increase. This 
can only be ascertained accurately for 
countries in which a regular system of regis- 
tering births and deaths is in force. Among 
these, the increase in New Zealand is the most 
rapid, with a rate of 18°1 per thousand ? (in 
1909); it is closely followed by New South 
Wales and Queensland, in which the numbers 
are, respectively, 17-8 and 17:5. South Aus- 
tralia is a little way below with 15:4. Then 
eomes Prussia with 14:8, and Victoria with 
18:4; in England and Wales, Scotland, Italy, 
and Hungary, the rate is between 11 and 12. 
In Spain it is 9-2, in Ireland 6°38, while France 
comes lowest on the list with 0-3. 
1 These numbers are taken from Newsholme, The 
Declining Birth-vate.
-P-A-G-E-213
EUGENICS 209 
If one turns from the figures to consider 
the causes of the differences indicated, the 
most obvious is that the now notorious 
decline in the birth-rate, a phenomenon to 
be observed in all civilised countries, began 
at different times in different places, and has 
consequently affected the diverse nationalities 
to a varying extent. In France, where the 
rate of increase is so low that the population 
may be regarded as practically stationary, 
the decline first started and has gone farthest, 
and the tendency to a diminished rate of 
increase thus established has not been counter- 
acted by any very marked decline in the 
death-rate. 
The Australasian colonies do not owe their 
high position in the list to any very great 
fertility among their inhabitants, but to the 
fact that their death-rate is very low. The 
low death-rate is not due entirely to excep- 
tionally healthy conditions, but partly to the 
immigration of large numbers of young and 
healthy people. In Hungary the birth-rate, 
though it has been considerably reduced in 
the last thirty years, is still the highest of 
those recorded; but as the death-rate is also 
very high—25-1 per thousand, as compared 
to New Zealand’s 9:2—the rate of natural 
increase is hardly greater than in England, 
where both birth-rate and death-rate are 
more than 10 per thousand lower. 
If one compares England and Prussia, one
-P-A-G-E-214
210 EUGENICS 
finds that in the latter the rate of increase 
is higher by 3°7 per thousand. The difference 
in the actual birth-rates is higher still, 
Prussia having a rate 81°8 to England’s 25:8; 
but the mortality, particularly the infant 
mortality in towns, is so much higher in 
Prussia that a great deal of the excess is 
wiped away. Havelock Ellis! brings forward 
reasons for the belief that in a few years’ 
time the rate of increase of the German 
population will be less than the English. 
The birth-rate of Berlin is already lower than 
that of London, and generally speaking the 
average number of children per family in 
German towns is less than in English towns 
of the same size. The rate is brought up by 
the inhabitants of the country districts, who 
are rapidly becoming relatively less numerous, 
while the urban population is fast increasing. 
Another comparison of special interest is 
that between the white and yellow races. 
Those who fear ‘the Yellow Peril’ picture to 
themselves a China swarming with countless 
and rapidly increasing myriads of people, 
all able to support life in tolerable comfort 
on a quarter of the weekly wage which would 
barely maintain a European labourer. If 
this picture were correct, we might well 
expect either a peaceful invasion, which would 
gradually but surely replace the white races 
by the yellow; or if this were prevented by 
1 Havelock Ellis, The Task of Social Hygiene.
-P-A-G-E-215
EUGENICS 211 
enforcing drastic laws against the immigra- 
tion of the Chinese, then an invasion of another 
kind by armies, trained in scientific warfare, 
careless of death and inexhaustible in 
numbers. 
There are no statistics available to tell one 
whether indeed the steady increase postu- 
lated is actually taking place or not, but 
Havelock Ellis has been able to collect 
evidence which should free one’s mind from 
apprehensions of the kind just alluded to. 
From the testimony of doctors practising 
in China, it appears that the number of 
children born is exceedingly large, but that 
the percentage of those who grow up is very 
small indeed. Lack of sanitation and infant- 
icide lead to a mortality rate which is 
estimated by some authorities to be as high 
as 90 per cent. of all children born. There 
are signs that Western ideas are likely to 
penetrate into China and lead to better con- 
ditions, and if this occurs the death-rate 
among children will undoubtedly go down; 
but the birth-rate will also probably be 
affected in a corresponding manner, so that 
we have little to fear in either case from the 
prospect of an inordinate growth in the 
numbers of the Chinese. 
It seems even more unlikely that the world 
will be overrun by Japanese. The birth-rate 
in Japan in 1901-2 was 86 per thousand, but 
has since then been falling, and meanwhile the
-P-A-G-E-216
  
212 EUGENICS 
death-rate has risen to 24 per thousand, so 
that the natural increase rate of the Japanese 
is now about the same or less than our own. 
The rise of the death-rate may be due largely 
to effects of the Russo-Japanese War, and, 
if so, it is likely to fall again. But even in this 
ease it does not appear probable that a high 
rate of natural increase will result. 
From this brief survey it should appear 
that although we may be able to measure 
the rate at which populations of some par- 
ticular countries are tending to multiply by 
reason of their own fertility, yet it would be 
impossible to form even the roughest esti- 
mate as to what changes in the proportions 
of the various races on the face of the globe 
will be seen during the next hundred years. 
Owing to the fact that the present rapid fall 
in the birth-rate started in different countries 
at different times, and that it has fallen in 
different degrees, we are now in a transi- 
tional stage, and no one can say when, if at 
all, the birth-rate and the death-rate in 
different places will become fairly constant. 
Till that occurs, little faith should be placed 
in prophecies. 
With regard to the causes of the declining 
birth-rate itself much has been written. The 
immediate problems which present them- 
selves may be indicated by the following 
questions :—Is the decline due to the fact that 
fewer people marry? or that people marry
-P-A-G-E-217
EUGENICS 218 
later in life? Does it depend on any lessening 
of the physiological capacity of women to 
bear children or of men to procreate them; 
or is it brought about by the deliberate 
intention of parents to limit the size of their 
families? It would be out of place here to 
enter into a detailed discussion of these points; 
it is obvious that all the four causes suggested 
may operate at the same time, but there is 
little doubt that the conscious limitation of 
families is the predominant factor. After 
assigning their proper share to each of these 
agencies, those who would go deeper into the 
question must determine the why and where- 
fore of it. Why, for instance, do people limit 
their families more than they used to? Some 
say it is because they are more selfish than 
they used to be, and additional children 
would mean the sacrifice of luxuries or even 
of what are regarded as necessary comforts; 
others, that it is due to the growth of social 
consciousness—a feeling of responsibility 
towards their children and towards society. 
Others, again, attribute it partly to the 
factory acts, which have, by placing restric- 
tions on child labour, to a great extent 
diminished, among the industrial classes, 
the value of children to their parents as a 
source of income. All these reasons may have 
in them an essence of truth. Different 
motives may move different people to do the 
same thing at the same time, when once the
-P-A-G-E-218
  214 EUGENICS 
possibility of it is suggested to them; and it 
is a commonplace to say that the motives of 
individuals are rarely unmixed. 
The relative increase or decrease of the 
racial constituents of a nation is a subject 
of great importance which has only been 
studied very little. It is a problem which 
concerns particularly countries where there 
is a constant influx of immigrants, for in these 
the greatest intermingling of races occur. In 
the United States the birth-rate of the native- 
born population appears to be on the whole 
very low and the average size of the family 
very small, while the families are larger and 
the birth-rate higher among the immigrants, 
who thus make a double contribution to the 
increase of the population. No general 
statistics are available to show this, but for 
some individual States detailed and reliable 
figures have been prepared. Of these, the 
most recent are those of Hoffmann,! based 
on the census returns of 1905 for the State of 
Rhode Island. He found that the average 
number of children for each married woman 
was 8°35 among the foreign born, and 2:06 
among the native born. The averages 
for the individual nationalities represented 
among the foreign born were :—French- 
Canadians, 4°42; Russians, 8°51; Italians, 
1F, L. Hoffmann, Maternity Statistics of the State of 
Rhode Island, State Census of 1905. Read before the First 
International Eugenics Congress.
-P-A-G-E-219
EUGENICS 215 
8:49; Irish, 8°45; Scotch and Welsh, 38:09; 
English, 2°89; German, 2°84; Swedes, 2°58; 
English-Canadians, 2°56; Poles, 2°31. In 
whatever way the married women are com- 
pared, and whatever factors, such as difference 
in age, are taken into account, the result is 
the same, that the foreign born are shown to 
be much more productive than the natives, 
and this greater productiveness is not counter- 
balanced bya much greater infantile mortality. 
At the time of the census, 75:7 per cent. of 
the children of the former survived, and 
79 per cent. of the latter—a difference quite 
insignificant in relation to’ the difference in 
the number of births. As the foreign born 
were almost a half of all the married women, 
the fact that the average numbers of their 
children is more than 50 per cent. higher than 
among*the native born is one of some im- 
portance in considering what will be the 
future constituents of the population. 
The Massachusetts State census for 1875 
and 1885 was conducted in such a way as to 
allow a similar comparison to be made, and 
the conclusion drawn from it was essentially 
the same. The average number of children 
to each married woman among the American 
born was 2°7, and among the foreign born 4°5. 
Owing to the general decline in the birth- 
rate, both these numbers are larger than 
those obtained from the Rhode Island 
census of 1905; but in 1885 the figures
-P-A-G-E-220
  
  216 EUGENICS 
there were almost the same as in Massa- 
chusetts. 
A curious contrast in fertility is shown 
between the French resident in France and 
those whose ancestors emigrated to Canada. 
It has just been noted that the latter after 
moving on from Canada to Rhode Island 
are the most prolific of the immigrants into 
that State, and in Canada itself the French 
are undoubtedly multiplying at a greater 
rate than the English. The most probable 
cause of this contrast is the greater influence 
of the Roman Catholic religion in Canada 
than in France. 
The nature and number of the emigrants 
into the younger countries and colonies is 
to a large extent determined by the rate of 
natural increase of the older communities 
in more densely-populated lands. Thus the 
changes in this respect shown by European 
countries since the decline of the birth-rate 
first set in have had a considerable influence 
on the nationalities represented among the 
many immigrants who yearly enter the 
United States. According to Havelock Ellis, 
the North European contingent, which was 
formerly 90 per cent. of the whole, has since 
1890 steadily sunk, and the majority now 
belong to the Central, Southern, and Eastern 
European stocks. The rate at which they 
multiply after settling in their adopted 
country, no less than the nature of the fresh
-P-A-G-E-221
  
EUGENICS 217 
arrivals, will determine the racial character 
and mould the evolution of the United 
States. : 
The older countries which they leave have 
in their time been filled with emigrants from 
other parts, who have come sometimes as. 
conquering armies and sometimes as peaceful 
and beneficent invaders, teaching new 
industries and enriching the lands in which, 
they settled. No European nation is a homo- 
geneous whole, all are everchanging groups of 
racial constituents incompletely blended. As 
these elements severally wax and wane, the 
mental, moral, and physical characters of 
the nations change, and the changes may 
be reflected in their history. A specu- 
lative attempt to interpret some phases 
of the history of Europe in this way has 
recently been made by Mr and Mrs Whet- 
ham.! 
The racial elements which they distinguish 
as having been the principal constituents of 
the European population during historical 
times are three. First, the Mediterranean 
race. It is ‘short of stature, dark of com- 
plexion and hair, long skulled, vivacious, 
gregarious, and one may perhaps add at 
once restless and easy going.’ It may be 
recognised now in a fairly pure condition in 
1W. C. D. and C. D. Whetham, The Influence of Race 
on History, Read before the First International Tee 
Ss 1912. = 
 
-P-A-G-E-222
  218 EUGENICS 
Treland, Wales, Cornwall, and parts of the 
West of Scotland. Secondly, the Armenoid 
race. This is of medium stature, medium 
colouring, and has a round skull. Thirdly, 
the Northern race. This is tall and long 
skulled, and in its pure condition blue-eyed 
and fair-haired. It is vigorous, loyal, deter- 
mined, and persevering, and it loves adven- 
ture. It may be found in its greatest purity 
in the Scandinavian peninsula and around 
the Dutch and English shores of the North 
Sea. 
The Whethams attribute the supremacy 
of Greece and Rome to a happily proportioned 
mixture of these races where the Northern 
provided the directing power. They see the 
cause of the decline and fall in the gradual 
dying out of the governing race, who suffered 
in numbers more than the others through 
losses in war and a_ lowered birth-rate, 
and were swamped by intermarriage. The 
Renaissance in Northern Italy they trace 
ultimately to the introduction of the right 
proportion of the Northern race, derived 
from the barbarian invaders of the later 
Roman Empire. 
Our present social conditions favour the 
Mediterranean rather than the Northern race. 
The latter are more numerous in the classes 
among which the birth-rate is lowest and 
the former live more readily in the towns, 
and the towns are gradually absorbing a
-P-A-G-E-223
  EUGENICS 219 
larger and larger proportion of the whole 
population. 
From a consideration of the relative increase 
or decrease in the racial elements we can pass 
to the related questions concerning the social 
classes. It has long been recognised that the 
birth-rate among the richer, which are essen- 
tially the same as the socially superior sections 
of the community, is lower than among the 
poorer. Sixty years ago! such a difference 
was already discernible, but it has become 
much increased through the accession of 
new factors in addition to those at that time 
operative. Then it was probably due wholly 
to the fact that marriages were usually con- 
tracted at a later age among the richer classes 
than among the poorer. This is still the case, 
but now, even when it is fully allowed for, 
a conspicuous difference remains. A difference 
of productiveness of this kind has been 
observed in most of the more important 
cities of Europe. Bertillon worked out the 
number of births each year for every thousand 
women between the ages of fifteen and fifty 
for different quarters in Paris, Berlin, Vienna, 
and London. The following table summar- 
ised his results,? published in 1897 :—

The relation which the birth-rate in different 
Metropolitan boroughs bears to their social 
and economic conditions has been studied 
more recently by Heron, and by Newsholme 
and Stevenson, 
Heron, using the correlation method, found 
that in London the birth-rate per 1000 married 
women, aged fifteen to fifty-four, is highest 
where the conditions show the greatest 
poverty—namely, in quarters where pawn- 
brokers abound, where unskilled labour is the 
principal source of income, where consump- 
tion is most common and most deadly, where 
pauperism is most rife, and, finally, where 
the greatest proportion of the children born 
die in infancy. The correlation coefficients 
show that the association of these evil con- 
ditions with the relative number of children 
born is a very close one, and if the question 
is put in another way, and the calculations 
are based on measures of prosperity instead 
of on measures of poverty, a high degree of 
correlation is found between prosperity and 
a low birth-rate. 
It must not be supposed that the high rate 
 
-P-A-G-E-225
  
EUGENICS 221 
of infant mortality, which almost invariably 
accompanies a high birth-rate, either in 
London or elsewhere, goes far towards 
counteracting the effects of the differential 
birth-rate. Where infant mortality is highest 
the average number of children above the 
age of two for each married woman is highest 
also, and although the chances of death at 
all ages are greater among the inhabitants 
of the poorer quarters, their rate of natural 
increase remains considerably higher than that 
of the inhabitants of the richer. 
From the detailed study of the figures made 
by Newsholme and Stevenson, conclusions 
essentially the same as those of Heron can 
be drawn. But as their results are in some 
ways more instructive than his, it is worth 
while to give some account of them also. 
Their first step was to divide the London 
boroughs into six groups according to the 
average number of domestic servants for 
100 families in each. This is probably as good 
@ measure of prosperity as any other. They 
then determined the total birth-rate of the 
population in each group, and arrived at the 
following figures :— 
Group 
I. 10 domestic servants for 100 families 34°97 
II. 10-20 a 2 88°32 
TII. 20-80 . - 25:99 
IV. 80-40 a 25°83 
V. 40-60 ie s 25°11 
VI. over 60 a ” 18°24
-P-A-G-E-226
  222 EUGENICS 
In order to find out how far the differ- 
ences shown by these figures are due to 
differences in the percentage of women who 
marry in each and the age at which they 
marry, they corrected the figures in such a 
way as to make them represent what the 
birth-rates would be in each group, if the 
proportion of wives of each age to the whole 
population comprising the group was the 
same as it is in the whole of England and 
Wales. The ‘corrected’ birth-rates thus 
obtained were as follows :— 
Group I.. 2 ° . 81°56 
Group II. . . ° . 25°82 
Group III. . . . « 25°68 
Group IV. . . . . 25°50 
Group V.. . Z . 25°36 
Group VI. . ° . . 20°45 
It will readily be seen that the effect of 
the correction has been to reduce the differ- 
ence between the two extreme groups by 
about one-third, showing that to this extent 
it is due to the way in which they differ as 
to the average age and number of the women 
who marry. Further, Groups II., II1., IV., 
and V. have all been brought to about the 
same level, with a corrected birth-rate about 
half-way between the highest and the lowest. 
This shows that there is no gradual decrease 
in fertility associated with a gradually in- 
creasing grade of prosperity, but that three 
sharply divided classes may be distinguished.
-P-A-G-E-227
  EUGENICS 223 
A very poor class with a high degree of 
fertility, to which about a quarter of the 
population of London belong, a rich class 
with a low degree of fertility, and a class 
intermediate in both respects. The com- 
parison between the corrected birth-rate 
shows the degree in which the voluntary limi- 
tation of families was practised in different 
parts of the Metropolis about ten to twelve 
years ago. There is reason to believe that 
if a similar comparison were made now, the 
difference between Group VI. and Groups 
II., I1., IV., and V. would be less marked, 
for it is thought that the practice is spreading 
among the lower middle and upper part of the 
working classes. 
Eugenics is less directly concerned with this 
side of the question than with the relative 
rate of increase of the different classes. This 
may be found for the six groups in the usual 
way by deducting the death-rate from the 
birth-rate. The following figures for the rate 
of natural increase are then obtained :— 
Group I., 16°56; Group II., 18°89; Group IIL, 
11:48; Group IV., 18°81; Group V., 10°29; 
Group VI., 5°79. The great difference between 
the rates in Group I. and Group VI. will be 
noted at once. The fact that Group IV., 
which consists of Wandsworth, Lewisham, 
and the City of London, stands out above 
Groups III. and V. is due to the fact that 
its death-rate is the lowest of any. 
 
-P-A-G-E-228
  224 EUGENICS 
The figures show in a manner which hardly 
admits of any doubt that in London at any 
rate the inhabitants of the poorest quarters— 
over a million in number—are reproducing 
themselves at a much greater rate than the 
more well-to-do. 
The French census of 1906 was conducted 
in such a way as to throw light on the com- 
parative fertility of people of different occu- 
pations. Monsieur March,! in analysing the 
data obtained, used as a basis of comparison 
the average number of children per 100 fami- 
lies in which the parents had been married 
for twenty-five years, or in which the head 
was sixty to sixty-five years old. The 
results ‘confirm what has previously been 
learnt by researches as to the influence on 
fertility of social status, social surround- 
ings, and income.’ Many other facts of 
importance can be ascertained from them, 
but they cannot be conveniently summarised 
here. 
‘The fact that the birth-rate is much 
smaller in higher than in lower social strata,’ 
Newsholme remarks, ‘has given rise to many 
Cassandra-like utterances.’ He goes on to 
suggest reasons for disregarding them. But 
Cassandra was a true prophetess, and her 
warnings were only ineffectual because they

la Statistique Générale de la France. Read before the 
Eugenics Congress, 1912.
-P-A-G-E-229
EUGENICS 225 
were disregarded by the Newsholmes of her 
time and city. 
The facts noted should receive the gravest 
consideration. They should not be lightly 
set aside because it is uncertain whether or 
to what degree the lower social strata are 
inferior in respect to inheritable mental or 
physical qualities to those above them, but 
an attempt should be made to collect and 
consider evidence on this point. Such data 
as are at present available for discussion all 
tend to show the average superiority of the 
upper classes. If mental capacity is inherited 
no other result could be expected. In every 
walk of life there are opportunities for a man 
to rise, and in most the qualities which will 
enable him to take advantage of them depend 
to some extent on mental capacity. 
It may be that the opportunities sometimes 
favour moral attributes of an anti-social 
kind, but they never favour a weak intellect; 
the predatory millionaire is perhaps ethically 
of the same standing as the burglar, but 
intellectually he far surpasses him. It may 
be that in some cases sheer good fortune 
forces one man up, and sheer ill fortune 
brings another man down. It is also possible 
that some deficiency in hardness of character 
keeps success away from a man who would 
otherwise win it; but if, after thirty years, 
one were to divide into groups, according to 
their rise or fall in life, men who had. set 
   
-P-A-G-E-230
  226 EUGENICS 
out together at the same time and from any 
given position in the social scale, there is 
surely no doubt that native ability would be 
present on the average to a higher degree 
in the group which had risen than in that 
which had merely maintained its position, or 
that the latter would contain more of it than 
that which had actually sunk. 
To turn to arguments of a different nature, 
the London County Council sets up educa- 
tional ladders in all parts of the Metropolis, 
but finds it difficult to get boys to go up them. 
The number of children in the schools main- 
tained by the rates who are bright enough 
to make it worth while to give them the 
scholarships provided by the London rate- 
payer is hardly enough to fill them. No 
difficulty is experienced in filling those at 
the Public Schools or University with boys 
of a very respectable level of intelligence, 
whose fathers belong mostly to the pro- 
fessional classes. This is a rough and vague 
method of comparison which, though not in 
itself very convincing, is put forward as 
deserving of thought. 
It is to the investigations of the experi- 
mental Psychologists that one may look most 
hopefully for the facts that will enable one 
to form a definite decision as to the relative 
intellectual worth of the raw material pro- 
duced by the different social classes. At 
present not enough is forthcoming to form
-P-A-G-E-231
EUGENICS © 227 
a really reliable basis for an opinion, and in 
its absence we should abstain from any 
dogmatic assertions as to the superiority of 
one or another. But, while recognising that 
certainty is far off, one must be guided by 
probability, and the probability appears to 
be that the classes who are providing more 
than their fair share of the coming genera- 
tions are actually the mentally inferior 
classes. 
It is urged by some people that the differ- 
ences in productiveness now shown are only 
temporary, and that in the course of a few 
years, owing to the downward spread of the 
habit of restricting families, the birth-rate 
will resume a uniform level throughout the 
whole community. This is a possibility, but 
it would be unwise to assume that it will 
ever be an actuality. At present, all one can 
say is that very small families are common 
among the better-class working men. But 
there seems to be no evidence that in 
the bottom stratum this will ever be the case. 
B.—Selective Mortality from Special Causes 
Dr W. C. Wells, in the year 1818, noted 
that negroes and mulattoes enjoy an immunity 
from certain tropical diseases, and con- 
cluded that they owed it to the fact that 
individuals unadapted to withstand them 
would be weeded out by death. And thus, 
 
-P-A-G-E-232
  228 ’ EUGENICS 
in the same way that domestic animals are 
improved by the conscious selection of their 
breeders, varieties of mankind suited to the 
localities in which they live would be pro- 
duced by the selective action of the indi- 
genous diseases. 
More recently the same idea has been 
developed by Dr Archdall Reid.1 His view, 
like that of Dr Wells, is that the mortality 
from a disease is a selective one. It tends to 
kill those who are by nature unable to resist 
it. If the power of resistance depends on 
some inheritable property of the body, it 
will be transmitted by those who survive the 
attacks of the disease to their children, and 
if these again are exposed to the chances of 
infection the less resistant will again succumb, 
and thus be less likely to leave children 
behind them than those who were better 
equipped for the fight. 
A number of particular diseases are dis- 
cussed by Dr Archdall Reid, and the follow- 
ing passage may here be taken as an example. 
With regard to malaria he writes, ‘Man’s 
evolution against malaria is more striking 
and conspicuous than that occasioned by 
any other disease, and that for two reasons. 
First, because in many districts infested by 
its microbes, it is so prevalent and so virulent 
that no man resident in them escapes 
infection unless he is immune, nor death unless 
1 Archdall Reid, The Principles of Heredity. 1905.
-P-A-G-E-233
  EUGENICS 229 
he is resistant. The elimination of the unfit, 
therefore, has been very thorough, and presum- 
ably it has been very prolonged. .. . Secondly, 
the illness occasioned by the disease is of 
a very sudden and marked character; and, 
therefore, observers are easily able to con- 
trast its effects on individuals of different 
races, and to perceive how much more 
resistant are those races which have pro- 
longed experience of it than those to which 
it is strange. This fact is admirably brought 
out in the following table :— 
In Ceylon there died of malaria fevers per 
1000 of the population— 
Negroes . ae at Natives of Ceylon . 70 
Natives of India 4:5 Europeans (English) 24°6 
Malays . spaalipre 
‘Just as regards malaria, so as regards 
tuberculosis, the resisting powers of any 
race is precisely in proportion to its past 
familiarity with the disease.’ 
According to the views expressed here, 
it appears that although the selective nature 
of deaths from disease do not have any 
general and direct Eugenic value, they do to 
some extent adapt mankind to the environ- 
ment which produces it. The action of a 
disease on human races is curiously paral- 
leled by the effects which the drugs given 
to drive it away have on the microscopic
-P-A-G-E-234
  230 EUGENICS 
organisms which cause it. As in the one 
case the race of men gradually becomes able 
to withstand the poison produced by the 
microbes, so in the other the race of microbes 
often acquires the power to withstand the 
poison administered by the man. 
Second to disease, the principal cause to 
which a selective action may be attributed 
is War.! Havelock Ellis says, ‘It is a remark- 
able tendency of the warlike spirit . . . that 
it tends to exterminate itself. Fighting 
stocks, and people largely made up of fight- 
ing stocks, are naturally killed out, and the 
field is left to the unwarlike. It is only the 
prudent—those who fight and run away— 
who live to fight another day; and they 
transmit their prudence to their offspring.’ 
We would venture to question this statement, 
and to point out that those who fight and 
run away, by so doing, probably prolong the 
war and increase the number of its victims, 
while reckless fighters, suitably led, may win 
so quickly that it is soon over. The sacrifice 
of life in war-time is due not so much to the 
lust for battle of those who die, but to 
imperfect sanitation and the blunders of 
the generals. The selective action of modern 
warfare is probably more concerned with 
physique than with moral qualities. 
1 Dr David Starr Jordan is the author from whose 
wore cine idea of the selective agency of war is ultimately 
lerived.
-P-A-G-E-235
  EUGENICS 231 
The tendency which great wars may 
have to cause deterioration in the physical 
characteristics of the nations engaged was 
discussed at the Eugenics Congress by 
Professor Kellogg. Its proof rests first, on 
the ‘determination of the character of that 
part of the population especially exposed to 
the selective mortality of war,’ and secondly, 
on ‘the determination of certain actual results 
of this selection.’ 
European armies consist of men who come 
up to a certain standard of physical develop- 
ment. The standard may be a low one, 
but in countries where military service is 
compulsory, those who escape it by reason 
of their defective physique form a con- 
siderable proportion of the whole number 
liable to serve. In France and Germany, 
thirty to fifty per cent. of the conscripts are 
rejected as unfit for service because of under- 
size, infirmities, or disease; and in 1911, out 
of 64,000 men who offered themselves for 
enlistment in England, Scotland, and Wales, 
forty-five per cent. did not reach the required 
standard. These figures are a_ sufficient 
illustration of the fact that if a war occurs, 
the men who lose their lives in it, either in 
battle or from disease, will be on an average 
physically superior to those of the corre- 
sponding age who are not exposed to the 
risks. It is hardly necessary to insist that in 
tv. L. Kellogg, Eugenics and Militarism.
-P-A-G-E-236
  232 EUGENICS 
a great war the number of the killed are by 
no means negligible, but form a quite con- 
siderable proportion of the populations from 
which they are drawn. 
The actual results of war on national 
physique may be deduced from the recruiting 
records of the French Government, which have 
been kept in some detail from the beginning 
of the last century. The figures show that 
the great wastage of life for which Napoleon 
was responsible had its effect in the progres- 
sive decrease in average stature in the mili- 
tary levies of 1818 and onwards. But when 
the men who were born after the Napoleonic 
wars started coming, in the average stature 
rose again by more than an inch. Corre- 
sponding to these changes in stature were 
changes in national vigour, which, though less 
easy to demonstrate, had a more lasting effect 
on the health of the nation. 
Far more numerous than losses in war are 
the deaths of infants from more or less 
preventible causes. The selective action of 
infant mortality is a question about which 
conflicting opinions are held, but about which 
there is little definite evidence. The conclu- 
sions arrived at by Mr Snow,? who made an 
elaborate statistical investigation of the 
subject, seem to point to the fact that it is 
actually the weakliest children who die in 
1E, C. Snow, The Intensity of Natural Selection in 
Man. 10911.
-P-A-G-E-237
  EUGENICS 238 
infancy. Mr. Snow’s results cannot, however, 
be accepted as established, and even if 
they were, one need not on that account 
suppose that heavy infant mortality has any 
beneficial effect, for it is more than probable 
that “the conditions which produce it cause 
harm to those who survive, and result in the 
production of a less healthy family than there 
would have been if only the number left over 
had been born in the first instance, and the 
conditions had been good enough to permit 
the survival of all. 
The Selective Marriage-rate and 
Sexual Selection 
These two agencies must be briefly referred 
to. A Selective Marriage-rate is of impor- 
tance in the way in which it affects the birth- 
rate. It may itself be due to Sexual 
Selection, or to regulations or customs which 
prevent or encourage marriage, of which 
examples are given in Chapter I. 
There is reason to believe that the move- 
ment for the emancipation of women, which 
is rendered so conspicuous by its more 
grotesque manifestations, is wide and deep 
enough to have a well-marked influence in 
sexual selection, the marriage-rate,.and the 
birth-rate. It owes its origin partly to the 
numerical excess of women over men, a 
condition which itself modifies sexual selection 
 
-P-A-G-E-238
  234 EUGENICS 
by putting the choice of a mate rather in the 
hands of men than of women. Among 
the professional classes the movement has 
encouraged the spread of higher education 
among women. This appears to have led to 
decreased fertility among some of the* most 
capable—a result probably not due to any 
decline of physiological capacity, but to the 
‘spinster influence’ in education. 
SUMMARY OF CHAPTER 
The birth-rate and death-rate are con- 
sidered, first, as agencies which may have an 
international significance in bringing about 
changes in the numerical relation between 
different nationalities and the population of 
the world. 
Considering individual nations separately, 
their character may be altered either by the 
relative increase of some of the racial elements 
comprising them, or by the more rapid 
multiplication of particular social classes. 
Certain researches illustrating these points 
are described. 
The selective action of disease, war, and 
infantile mortality are next treated, and, 
finally, reference is made to marriage-rates 
and sexual selection.

CHAPTER XI 
SOCIAL CONTROL, AND SUGGESTIONS FOR 
A PRACTICAL POLICY 
Tue practical measures by which Eugenic 
principles may be applied are sometimes 
divided into two classes, called respectively 
positive and negative. Positive Eugenics 
aims at securing the multiplication of those 
individuals who are inherently above the 
average in physical, mental, and moral 
qualities. Negative Eugenics aims at pre- 
venting increase of the stocks from which 
persons inferior in these respects may be 
expected to be derived. This classification 
is open to a good deal of criticism, and the 
words positive and negative are hardly well 
chosen. The measures sometimes advocated 
under the hcading of negative Eugenics are 
generally of a more positive description than 
any which could reasonably be suggested in 
the other category, and much that is most 
feasible in the proposals for an Eugenic 
policy cannot be entered in either class. For 
example, by the teaching of sexual hygiene 
and the promulgation of sane ideals in respect 
to marriage and procreation, it is endeavoured 
at the same time to secure that the maximum 
number of children shall be raised and reared
-P-A-G-E-240
  236 EUGENICS 
under the best possible conditions of parent- 
age, and the minimum under the worst. 
Therefore, in considering the methods by 
which the social control is or possibly can be 
brought to bear on the agencies which im- 
prove and impair the racial qualities of future 
generations, this classification will not be 
used, but the methods will be grouped accord- 
ing to the manner in which the control is 
exercised. The most important class com- 
prises marriage laws and customs. 
Marriage Laws and Customs 
It is sometimes urged by persons opposed 
to Eugenics that it can only proceed by 
enforcing restrictions in marriage, and that 
such restrictions are either impossible or 
undesirable in that they would lead to worse 
results than those which they were designed 
to prevent. Two answers may be made to 
this objection: first, that restrictions in 
marriage form no necessary part of an 
Eugenic policy; secondly, that such restric- 
tions may be and have been enforced with 
ease and without friction. In a paper on the 
siBjes, read by Sir Francis Galton before the 
Sociological Society in 1905, he reviews 
certain laws and customs which interfere 
with the free selection of a mate. The first 
of these is monogamy, a restriction not 
imposed by natural instinct, but owing its
-P-A-G-E-241
  EUGENICS 237 
origin to a consideration for social well- 
being. The majority of people belonging to 
those nations among whom monogamy is in 
force aquiesce in it with readiness, even if 
some rebel and form what are practically 
polygamous connections. 
Secondly, ‘Endogamy, or the custom of 
marrying exclusively within one’s own tribe 
or caste,! has been sanctioned by religion 
and enforced by law in all parts of the world.’ 
Exogamy, which is the exact opposite of 
endogamy, has been as widely spread and is 
now practised largely by barbarians. Among 
the Australian bushmen the customs regulat- 
ing marriage are both very complicated and 
very rigidly enforced, while the prohibition 
of marriage among kinsmen of some degrees, 
and celibacy voluntarily assumed from 
religious motives are familiar to all. Galton 
argues that if such restrictions as these have 
been submitted to, it would be possible 
among a people impressed with the virtues of 
the Eugenic ideal to enforce others which have 
for their object the improvement of the race. 
Marriage laws, in so far as they concern 
themselves with the biological aspects of 
marriage, are discussed by Mr C. B. Daven- 
port, in a paper communicated to the Eugenic 
Congress of 1912. He points, firstly, to the 
“1 In civilised countries endogamy is practised, in that 
it is almost a universal custom to marry within one’s 
own social class.
-P-A-G-E-242
  238 EUGENICS 
fact that in all civilised States persons related 
to one another in certain degrees are not 
permitted to intermarry, and he suggests that 
the prohibition arises from society’s early 
and evil experience of the results of such 
matings. Records of the offspring of such 
incestuous matings as brother and _ sister, 
father and daughter, are forthcoming in 
considerable numbers at the present day, 
and would certainly seem to confirm the 
essential wisdom of the laws forbidding 
them. But when the degree of relationship 
is as distant as that of first cousins the case 
is much more doubtful. In Europe such 
marriages are allowed by the civil law of 
most countries, but in some, where the 
canonical law of the Roman or Greek Church 
is in force, they are prohibited. In Greece 
and Russia a man may not marry his first or 
second cousins or any relatives to the sixth 
degree. In Spain, marriage is not permitted 
to relatives of the fourth degree, which 
include first cousins, and in Austria also 
marriages of the latter are prohibited. It 
appears, however, that in all these countries 
dispensations can be obtained without much 
difficulty; and in America, where there are 
laws forbidding marriages between first 
cousins in sixteen States, it is questionable 
to what extent they are enforced. Such 
laws are bound to be ineffective unless sanc- 
tioned and supported by public opinion.
-P-A-G-E-243
  
EUGENICS 2389 
With the exception of religious eelibacy, 
which could obviously never becomé univegsal 
among any people, the restrictive laws and 
customs hitherto mentioned are the less 
harsh, and therefore the more readily sub- 
mitted to, in that they do not prevent any 
individual from marrying—they merely limit 
him in the choice of a mate. Some, however, 
actually in force, go further and absolutely 
prohibit matrimony to persons who do not 
reach to a required standard. Thus, accord- 
ing to Westermarck, among certain savage 
tribes a man is not allowed to take a wife 
unless he can show he is capable of 
supporting her. The proof of his ability 
differs from place to place, according to 
circumstances. Among certain Bechuana 
and Kafir tribes the prospective husband 
must have killed a rhinoceros; among the 
Dyaks of Borneo, and _ other peoples 
in the Malay Archipelago, the minimum 
requirement is the acquisition of a cer- 
tain number of heads from foreign tribes, 
by the slaughter of their original owners. 
The same idea can be recognised in the 
marriage laws even of civilised countries, for 
in the American State of Delaware marriages 
of paupers are not permitted, and in 
Indiana no male who is or has been within 
five years an inmate of any county asylum 
or home for indigent persons is allowed to 
marry unless he can show that the cause of 
 
-P-A-G-E-244
  
  240 EUGENICS 
his condition has been removed and that he 
can support a family. 
In many countries, such as Austria, Switzer- 
land, and the greater part of the United 
States, idiots or insane persons are not 
permitted to marry on the legal ground that 
they are incapable of making a valid con- 
tract; but in some the Eugenic principle is 
recognised by extending the prohibition to 
epileptics and other persons to whom this 
reason does not apply. The State of Washing- 
ton goes furthest in this respect by not 
allowing ‘Marriages of common drunkards, 
habitual criminals, epileptics, imbeciles, 
feeble-minded, or those who are afflicted with 
hereditary insanity, advanced consumption, 
or any contagious venereal disease.’ It is 
obvious that this enactment has been made 
in order to prevent the reproduction of 
persons in the conditions mentioned, because 
it does not apply to marriages in which the 
female party is over forty-five years of age. 
In Kansas, in order to supplement the 
prohibition made for the same reason of the 
marriage of epileptics, imbeciles, feeble-minded 
or insane persons, a law has been passed 
making cohabitation between unmarried 
persons a criminal offence. There is no 
ground for supposing that any good can come 
from laws such as these. Even if it were 
possible to prevent by statute the marriage 
of epileptics and feeble-minded persons and
-P-A-G-E-245
  EUGENICS 241 
their like, illegitimate unions and the increase 
of prostitution would be the result, and there 
is abundant proof that laws are powerless 
to stop these evils. 
Regulations permitting the annulment of 
marriages in which one of the parties has 
concealed some fact of importance concerning 
his mental or bodily health are in force in 
some countries, and have been recommended 
by the Majority Report of the recent Divorce 
Commission. They are in many ways of 
greater Eugenic value than prohibitions of 
the kind described, and inflict undeserved 
hardship on no one, but rather serve as a pro- 
tection against it. In Switzerland a marriage 
may be rendered void ‘by one of the spouses, 
where a disease, which seriously endangers 
the health of the petitioner or his descendants, 
has been concealed from him.’ In Portugal 
and in Brazil a marriage may be annulled 
on the ground that a mistake has been made 
by one spouse owing to ignorance of a crime 
committed by the other before marriage, or 
of a previous incurable physical defect or 
any incurable contagious or _ hereditary 
disease. 
The principle recognised in these regula- 
tions, that each party to a marriage has the 
“right to know those facts concerning the 
bodily condition of the other which may 
affect him or his children, is carried a step 
E L 
 
-P-A-G-E-246
  242 EUGENICS 
further in the following proposals laid before 
the Norwegian Storthing by Dr Mjéen! :— 
‘That [in addition to the provisions at present 
embodied in the marriage law] there should 
be a declaration by each of the two con- 
tracting parties, made at a date not exceeding 
six months before marriage, in regard to 
whether either is subject to a disease or 
weakness which might have an injurious 
effect on the health of the other or of the 
offspring; and, further, that each declara- 
tion should be accompanied by a document 
signed by the parents or guardians of both 
parties, stating that it has been submitted 
to their notice, and that, consequently, they 
have had opportunity to raise any necessary 
objections or to make representations to 
the one or the other of the couple intending 
marriage. The declarations should be made 
before a physician authorised by the State.’ 
If this proposal were adopted, it would 
no doubt have to be enforced either by 
making punishable a false declaration made 
with intent to deceive, or by considering it 
a ground for the annulment of the marriage. 
It is intended primarily to protect women 
from marrying men suffering from venereal 
disease, but is capable of effecting other 
Eugenic objects. Thus the disclosure of 
1Translated from Nylaende (Norwegian Journal of 
Women’s Rights), quoted from The Eugenics Review, 
Vol. IV., No. 4, 1913.
-P-A-G-E-247
  EUGENICS 243 
cpilepsy or a tendency to insanity might well 
be insisted on, and even in cases where both 
parties agreed to the marriage in spite of 
such defects they would be warned to take 
advice concerning the desirability of having 
children. 
Sterilisation and Institutional Care 
By sterilisation is meant the removal of 
power of reproduction. This may be accom- 
plished by simple operations, which do 
not interfere with normal life in any way. 
In man they are attended by no sort of 
danger, but some risk is run in the case of 
women. It would be out of place here to 
discuss the nature of these operations; it is 
sufficient to point out that castration is not 
among them. 
Laws permitting or enforcing sterilisation 
in certain cases have been passed in several 
States of the American Union, but up till 
quite recently it has been difficult to obtain 
information as to how they were working. 
The difficulty has now been removed by the 
action of the Eugenic Section of the American 
Breeders’ Association in appointing a com- 
mittee ‘To study and report on the best 
practical means for cutting off the defective 
germplasm in the human population.’ Though 
the wording of the terms of reference may 
raise a smile, by the naive way in which a 
 
-P-A-G-E-248
  244 EUGENICS 
practical problem is expressed in the language 
of a biological theory, the committee is 
a serious and business-like body, consisting 
of men of ability and experience, and assisted 
by specialists in all branches of relevant 
knowledge. Their preliminary report was 
communicated to the Eugenics Congress by 
the chairman, Mr Bleecker Van Wagenen, 
and contains an account of the American 
sterilisation laws and of the extent to which 
they have been enforced, together with a 
careful examination of the actual effects on 
the subjects of the operations involved. The 
eight States which have passed laws of this 
description, together with the dates in which 
they were passed are given as follows :— 
Indiana, 1907; Washington, 1909; California, 
1909; Connecticut, 1909; Nevada, 1911; 
Iowa, 1911; New Jersey, 1911; New York, 
1912. But at the present time their opera- 
tion has been suspended as the question has 
been raised whether the constitution of the 
Union permits of such enactments by indi- 
vidual States. It thus happens that only in 
the case of Indiana and California have they 
ever been enforced. In Indiana a commission, 
consisting of three surgeons, is empowered to 
select for treatment from reformatories or 
other State institutions of a similar nature 
persons ‘deemed by them to be unimprovable 
mentally and physically, and unfit for pro- 
creation.’ During the year 1907 and 1908
-P-A-G-E-249
  EUGENICS 245 
125 operations were compulsorily performed, 
but in January, 1909, a new governor 
was elected opposed to such measures, and 
since then nothing of the kind has been 
done. 
In California the persons subject are inmates 
of State hospitals for the Insane and homes 
for the Feeble-minded, inmates of State 
prisons committed for life or showing sexual 
or moral perversion, also those who have been 
twice committed for sexual offences or three 
times for other crimes. The selection is 
made on the recommendation of the superin- 
tendent or resident physician to a board 
consisting of himself, three general superin- 
tendents, and the secretary of the State 
Board of Health. Whereas in Indiana the 
motive of the State in passing the law is 
purely Eugenic, in California the principal 
object is the physical, mental, and moral 
improvement of the persons operated on. 
Although armed with compulsory powers, 
the board referred to has, as far as possible, 
avoided using them. In the majority of 
eases where the operation was indicated, the 
written consent of the patient’s relatives was 
obtained. In some the decision was made 
by the patient himself, if he was mentally 
in a condition sound enough to render a 
reasoned consideration of the question possible. 
In all two hundred and twenty persons, 
ninety-four of them women, have been 
 
-P-A-G-E-250
  
246 EUGENICS 
treated in the Jeffersonville reformatory since 
November, 1910. 
Besides inquiring into the nature of these 
laws, and the extent of their practical appli- 
cation, the committee took special pains to 
find out what physical or psychical changes 
were produced on the persons operated on, 
and whether any undesigned hardship or 
discomfort was inflicted or any risk entailed. 
They found that the operation usually per- 
formed on men is simple and _ practicable, 
that it is attended by no risk or discomfort, 
and does not interfere with the sexual func- 
tions except in attaining its object of prevent- 
ing procreation. It does not appear to modify 
the mental or moral character in any unde- 
sirable way. There are three different opera- 
tions of a parallel nature which may be per- 
formed on women, but none of them is wholly 
free from danger to life or of disturbance in 
other bodily and mental functions. 
The enactment of these laws in America 
has not been due to any general demand for 
them. They were carried through owing to 
the enthusiasm of quite a small number of 
people among a public caring for none of 
such things. In some States where bills 
were introduced a hostile attitude taken up 
by one determined person was enough to 
prevent them becoming law.  Sterilisation 
inflicted compulsorily under such a law as 
that of Indiana is in effect a punishment
-P-A-G-E-251
  EUGENICS 247 
imposed by a board which differs from a 
court of justice, both in its ccnstitution and 
in the fact that the prisoner is not heard in 
his own defence or represented by counsel. 
As the first principles of justice are thus 
traversed, it is undesirable and unlikely that 
legislation entailing it will ever become at 
all general; indeed, it seems likely that it has 
already received its death-blow. But against 
sterilisation by consent there could be no 
objection on the ground described above, and 
it might be regarded in many cases as a 
desirable substitute for a lengthy incarcera- 
tion in some institution. A typical case of 
this nature is brought forward by the com- 
mittee, and will here be quoted. 
‘Case and family history of H., an inmate 
of the Boston State Hospital for the Insane. 
The patient is 42 years of age, a native of 
Treland, had been committed to an insane 
hospital before coming to America. Good 
habits, steady worker, can earn ten dollars 
a week in low-grade shipping work. The 
wife of the patient is of a decidedly inferior 
make-up, but is a good mother, and keeps 
a clean and orderly house. She said they had 
had all the children they could provide for, 
and that they do not want any more, but 
realised that probably more would come.’ 
Of the children which they had already had, 
four had died in infancy and three were 
feeble-minded, only one appeared to be alive 
—
-P-A-G-E-252
  
248 EUGENICS 
and normal. ‘After a few months treatment 
it was found that the patient had apparently 
recovered, and was able to go back to the 
industrial world, and it was learnt that he 
could secure his old position at ten dollars 
a week. Meanwhile the patient was at the 
State expense and his family was depending 
on charity. The only objection to his release 
was the danger of propagating more children 
of the sort already produced. The operation 
was proposed, but he objected. The wife was 
brought in, and the patient, hospital authori- 
ties, and the wife held a conference. The 
operation was finally agreed to by the man, 
and was performed, and the patient dis- 
charged.’ 
Cases like this seem to show that there are 
occasions in which sterilisation can be per- 
formed without imposing hardship on any 
one, and almost with the certainty of pre- 
venting the birth of feeble-minded children, 
destined, if born, to be a burden to the 
community. Thus even in the present state 
of our knowledge of the laws of heredity it 
should receive consideration as a practical 
Eugenic measure. The only alternative which 
eould effect the same object is some form of 
custodial care, either in an institution or 
under suitable guardianship. This has rot 
the objection of being irrevocable, and has 
the positive merit of keeping safe those per- 
sons who would otherwise be likely to injure 
_p... ~
-P-A-G-E-253
  EUGENICS 249 
themselves and others. It is indeed almost 
entirely on the latter ground that custodial 
care is proposed in such measures as the 
Mental Deficiency Bill, which was introduced 
into Parliament in 1912. This bill provided 
that certain classes of the mentally deficient 
might be placed in a special institution or 
under guardianship—namely, ‘those who are 
found wandering about, neglected, or cruelly 
treated ; who are charged with the com- 
mission of any offence, or are undergoing 
imprisonment or penal servitude or detention 
in a place of detention, or a reformatory or 
industrial school, or an inebriate reformatory, 
or who are habitual drunkards within the 
meaning of the Inebriates Acts, 1879 and 
1900; also those children discharged at the 
age of sixteen from the special schools and 
classes for defective and epileptic children, 
for whom, in their own interest, the local 
education authority thinks such care desir- 
able,’ and one or two other vaguer categories. 
This bill was opposed principally on the 
ground that it interfered with individual 
liberty, an objection which might be made to 
all laws made for the protection of society; 
no measure of liberty is possible for any one 
unless some bounds are placed to the liberty 
of all. Freedom is nothing to be desired in 
itself; . but is only valuable as a condition 
antecedent to that companionship with others 
and to that employment of the mind or body
-P-A-G-E-254
  
250 EUGENICS 
which bring happiness and completion to the 
lives of human beings. Where freedom leads 
to no such development, but merely to evil 
which spreads and grows, it destroys itself by 
forging fetters of crime and drunkenness, 
disease and vice. It is no brutal tyranny 
that aims at saving from such evils those who 
cannot save themselves. 
Some other methods of social control may 
be considered more conveniently in the 
suggestions for a practical Eugenie policy, 
which will form the concluding part of this 
volume. 
Suggestions for an immediate Eugenic Policy 
It is sometimes urged against Eugenics 
by those who admit the soundness of its 
theoretical basis, that it is impossible to 
carry into practice any of the lessons which 
it would teach. There is no form of prophecy 
which has more repeatedly been falsified than 
assertions of impossibility. It is urged by 
others that a vastly wider and more exaz 
knowledge of heredity is required before any 
practical steps may be safely taken. The 
answer to this is that the knowledge avail- 
able at present is enough to justify a fairly 
wide programme, on which the acquisition 
of fresh knowledge must stand first. 
- There is ample knowledge to justify the 
introduction of a measure for the care and 
control of the feeble-minded and of moval
-P-A-G-E-255
EUGENICS 251 
imbeciles—that is to say, ‘persons who from 
an early age display some mental defect, 
coupled with strong vicious or criminal pro- 
pensities on which punishment has little or 
no deterrent effect.’ This control should be 
of a sufficiently effective and permanent kind 
to preclude the possibility of such persons 
propagating their kind. 
The passing of such a measure is the only 
directly Eugenic legislation which can at present 
be advocated, and it may be urged more 
strongly on purely humanitarian grounds. 
Another practical step which may be taken 
with safety is the examination of existing 
laws and customs in order to determine their 
effect on future generations. In particular, 
the incidence of taxation is a point to be 
considered; the Eugenist should advocate its 
adjustment in such a way as not to penalise 
parenthood among the self-supporting classes. 
The equity of this principle has already been 
recognised, though in an altogether inadequate 
manner, in the Finance Act of 1909, under 
which a rebatement of income tax for each 
child, amounting to seven shillings and six- 
pence per annum, is allowed to fathers of 
families with an income of under £500 a year. 
But it is local rather than imperial taxa- 
tion which places the heaviest burden on the 
family. The rates levied on house property 
may be considered to some extent as a tax 
on the children of the self-supporting, which     
          
      
    
                      
   
     
-P-A-G-E-256
  
252 EUGENICS 
is levied largely for the purpose of rearing 
the children of those who either do not 
support themselves or do not do so com- 
pletely. This condition arises because among 
the classes on whom the burden rests most 
heavily a man with a large family cannot 
economise by living in a small house, so he 
suffers first by having to pay a larger rent 
than would otherwise be necessary, and then is 
taxed according to the amount of rent he pays. 
It is not suggested that Eugenists should 
immediately start an agitation for rating 
reform, but they should point out the manner 
in which some of the taxes or laws already in 
force tend to have a differentiating action 
on the birth-rate, and they should examine 
contemplated additions or alterations of the: 
present system from the same point of view. 
Their immediate aim must be to impress the 
importance of these considerations on the 
persons responsible for the adjustment o! 
taxation or the introduction of legislation, 
and also on the public who by their votes 
ignorantly exercise a vague and spasmodic 
control over Parliamentary action. 
There are many other ways in which 
marriage and parenthood are discouraged 
among people who are generally able and 
efficient members of the community. Both 
private individuals and public bodies often 
find it convenient to offer some accommo- 
dation in part payment for the services of
-P-A-G-E-257
  KUGENICS 253 
employees. This accommodation is often so 
inadequate that the possibility of marriage 
is altogether precluded. In other cases 
marriage is permitted, and it may be actually 
insisted on because it is convenient to employ 
a man and his wife together; but then the 
condition is often made that there should be 
no children, which are for this purpose 
described as encumbrances. Even when these 
degrading terms of employment are not 
insisted on, the house-room provided is often 
so deficient in space, light, and ventilation, 
that it is almost impossible to rear a healthy 
family in it. Eugenists should see to it that 
they are themselves free from reproach in 
this respect, they will then be in a position 
to reform others. 
We can next turn our attention to the 
marriage laws, in which some alteration is to 
be advocated. Where one party to the con- 
tract conceals some disease or defect of a 
kind which is dangerous to the other, or is 
likely to be the cause of heavy mortality or 
serious defects among the offspring, the right 
of annulling the marriage within a certain 
time should be allowed. Whether insanity 
or any serious disease developed after marriage 
1 What has been said above does not apply to female 
domestic servants, because their occupation is for the most 
part not a life work, but merely a means by which they 
may subsist till marriage, when the occupations and 
duties which it entails in any case prevent their con- 
tinuing in service.
-P-A-G-E-258
254 EUGENICS 
should be a ground for divorce is a question 
which is more difficult to answer from the 
consideration of its Eugenic aspect; but cn 
the whole it seems likely that divorce is 
more desirable in such cases than legal separa- 
tion. The latter prevents both parties from 
re-marrying, and, in doing so, directly ea- 
courages the various kinds of illegitimate 
unions which are all likely to be dysgenic in 
one way or another. Its action is also harrn- 
ful by being selective, because it is far more 
likely to prevent those whose actions are 
eontrolled by a respect for law and morality 
from having children, than those who merely 
aim at self-gratification. 
The crude and impracticable proposal, that 
before being allowed to marry, it should be 
necessary to obtain a medical certificate of 
fitness, must next be mentioned. It has no 
serious advocates now, so the objections to 
it need not be discussed. But it has led 
to other suggestions for which a great deal 
may be said. The Norwegian scheme of 
health declarations before marriage has 
already been described in this chapter, and 
although there is little chance of its intro- 
duction into this country, yet something of 
the same kind, run on voluntary lines, mizht 
well be started. If, as the result of gradual 
education on these matters, public opinion 
sanctioned and supported such a scheme, it 
would be widely extended, because tien
-P-A-G-E-259
  EUGENICS 255 
people would hesitate before marrying any 
man or woman who refused to make the 
required declaration, and thus it might have 
a valuable Eugenic influence. 
But though something of use may be done 
by the modification of our laws and customs 
in these and in other directions, the most 
important task before the apostle of Eugenics 
is the dissemination of the Eugenic ideal. 
By this is meant the co-ordinated group of 
sentiments, aspirations, and desires, based 
on a right appreciation of moral and social 
values, which will lead those in whom they 
are implanted to enter gladly, but wisely, and 
with a sense of responsibility, on the duties 
and privileges of marriage and parenthood. 
If its influence is to be effective, the right 
notions must be planted in the human mind 
while it is still young, and thus the suggestion 
has been made that Eugenics should be in 
some way introduced among the lessons 
learnt at school. How this should be done 
is a pedagogic question of much difficulty, 
on which the Eugenist as such can hardly be 
expected to express an opinion. His object 
must be to convert those whose business it 
is to guide the education of youth, and to 
supply them with the knowledge necessary 
for teaching the subject. The devising of 
practical methods of so doing must be left 
to them. To impress on a body of men and 
women who have the reputation of being 
 
-P-A-G-E-260
956 EUGENICS 
excessively conservative the desirability of 
teaching a subject so unlike any included in 
the old-fashioned school curriculum might 
seem a task of considerable difficulty; but 
it is lightened by the fact that already a 
strong movement is on foot among them for 
introducing instruction in ‘sexual hygiene,’ 
which is itself of direct Eugenic value. The 
object of this movement is to guard growing 
boys and girls from the unhealthy and vicious 
habits and thoughts into which they may be 
led during the development of their sexuzl 
instincts. Into lessons in sexual hygiene, if 
they are found to be valuable and practicable, 
Eugenics might well enter, as these lessons 
would form a fitting introduction to it, while 
it would supply them with a larger and move 
spiritual aim, such as might well commend 
itself to those whose time of life renders then 
particularly susceptible to the appeal of ell 
that is spiritual and altruistic. 
By the Eugenic ideal Love must be. guided, 
and to it baser motives for marriage must le 
subjected. Those who are carelessly contented 
with our present manners and customs or 
fear too much the difficulty of modifying 
them are in the habit of expressing in hack- 
neyed proverbs the view that Love cannot 
be guided or controlled. They say that ‘Love 
is blind.’ The original meaning of this must 
be that the blind god shoots his arrows at 
random, and thus the mutual attractions
-P-A-G-E-261
  EUGENICS 257 
felt by his victims are the results of chance 
and not of choice. This is obviously untrue. 
The more usual interpretation is that lovers 
are blind to one another’s faults. Fortunately 
this is to some extent true; but the inference 
drawn from it, that they cannot exercise 
conscious selection of a rational kind is 
thoroughly false. That ‘Love laughs at 
locksmiths’ is also maintained, but in answer 
it may be said that Love seldom tampers 
with a well-made lock. Lovers of strong 
character may refuse to be kept apart by 
essentially insignificant things; but what 
they themselves recognise as serious obstacles 
to their union usually prevent the idea of 
love from arising in the first instance. 
Eugenics must teach what may be rightly 
considered as serious obstacles, but its 
teaching should not be merely negative. 
With its spirit the ethics of love and marriage 
must be imbued. It must place in every 
heart an image of the ideal lover, to serve 
both as a guide anda goal; an ideal of all 
that is best and most desirable in body, 
mind, and conduct; an ideal which should 
be founded not on false sentimentality but on 
a deep and true knowledge of nature. In 
this way Love and Knowledge will unite 
‘to grasp this sorry scheme of things’ to the 
end that, patiently and hopefully, with no 
petulant ‘shattering to bits,’ they may 
Remould it nearer to the heart’s desire.

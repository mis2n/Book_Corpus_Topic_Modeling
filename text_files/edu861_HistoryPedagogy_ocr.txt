TRANSLATOR’S PREFACE. 
—ro-— 
HE two considerations that have chiefly influenced me in 
making this translation are the following : — 
1. Of the three phases of educational study, the prac- 
tical, the theoretical, and the historical, the last, as proved 
by the number of works written on the subject, has received 
but very little attention from English and American teach- 
ers; and yet, if we allow that a teacher should first of all 
_ be a man of culture, and that an invaluable factor in his 
professional education is a knowledge of what has hitherto 
been done within his field of activity, there are the best of 
reasons why the claims of this study should be urged upon 
the teaching profession. For giving breadth of view, 
judicial candor, and steadiness of purpose, nothing more 
helpful can be comménded to the teacher than a critical 
survey of the manifold experiments and experiences iv 
educational practice. The acutest thinkers of all the ages 
have worked at the solution of the educational problem, and 
the educating art has been practised under every variety of 
conditions, civil, social, religious, philosophic, and ethnic. 
Is it not time for us to review these experiments, as the 
very best condition for advancing surely and steadily ? 
2. The almost complete neglect of this study among us 
has been due, in great measure, to the fact that there have
-P-A-G-E-6
vi TRANSLATOR’S PREFACE. 
been no books on the subject at all adapted to the ends to 
be attained. A dry, scrappy, and incomplete narration of 
facts can end only in bewilderment and in blunting the taste 
for this species of inquiry. The desirable thing has been 
a book that is comprehensive without being tedious, whose 
treatment is articulate and clear, and that is pervaded by a 
critical insight at once catholic and accurate. Some years 
ago I read with the keenest admiration, the Histoire Critique 
des Doctrines de P Education en France depuis le Seizidme 
Siecle, by Gabriel Compayré (Paris, 1879) ; and it seemed 
to me a model, in matter and method, for a general history 
of education. Within a recent period Monsieur Compayré 
has transformed this Histoire Critique into such a general 
history of education, under the title Histoire de la Pédagogie. 
In this book all the characteristics of the earlier work have 
been préserved, and it represents to my own mind very 
nearly the ideal of the treatise that is needed by the teach- 
ing profession of this country. 
The reader will observe the distinction made by Monsieur 
Compayré between Pedagogy and Education. Though our 
nomenclature does not sanction this distinction, and though 
I prefer to give to the term Pedagogy a different connota- 
tion, I have felt bound on moral grounds to preserve Mon- 
sieur Compayré’s use of these terms wherever the context 
would sanction it. 
It seems mere squeamishness to object to the use of the 
- word Pedagogy on account of historical associations. The 
fact that this term is in reputable use in German, French,
-P-A-G-E-7
_ TRANSLATOR’S PREFACE, vit 
and Italian educational literature, is a sufficient guaranty 
that we may use it without danger. With us, the term 
Pedagogies seems to be employed asa synonym for Peda- 
gogy. It would seem to me better to follow continental 
usage, and restrict the term Pedagogy to the art or practice 
of education, and. Pedagogies to the correlative science. 
I feel under special obligations to Monsieur Compayré, 
and to his publisher, Monsieur Paul Delaplane, for their 
eourteous permission to publish this translation. I am alse 
greatly indebted to my friend, Mr. C. E. Lowrey, Ph.D., for 
material aid in important details of my work.

INTRODUCTION. 
War a Comrrern Hisrory or EpucatioN WOULD BE.— 
In writing an elementary history of pedagogy, I do not 
pretend to write a history of education. Pedagogy and 
education, like logic and science, or like rhetoric and 
eloquence, are different though analogous things. 
What would a complete history of education not. 
include? It would embrace, in its vast developments, 
the entire record of ‘the intellectual and-moral culture 
of mankind at all-periods and in all countries. It would 
be a résumé of the life of humanity in its diverse man- 
ifestations, literary and scientific, religious and political. 
It would determine the causes, so numerous and so diverse; 
which act upon the characters of men, and which, modi- 
fying a common endowment, produce beings as different 
as are a contemporary of Pericles and a modern Euro- 
pean, a Frenchman of the middle ages and a Frenchman 
subsequent to the Revolution. ‘ 
In fact, there is not only an education, properly so called, 
that which is given in schools and which proceeds from 
the direct action of teachers, but there is a natural educa- 
tion, which we receive without our knowledge or will;
-P-A-G-E-10
x . INTRODUCTION. 
through the influence of the social environment in which 
we live. There are what a philosopher of the day has 
ingeniously called the occult coadjutors of education, — 
climate, race, manners, social condition, political institu- 
tions, religious beliefs. If a man of the nineteenth cen- 
tury is very unlike a man of the seventeenth century, it 
is not merely because the first was educated in a Lycée 
of the University and the other in a college of the 
Jesuits; it is also because in the atmosphere in which 
they have been enveloped they have contracted differ- 
ent habits of mind and heart; it is because they have 
grown up under different laws, under a different social 
and political régime; because they have been , nurtured 
‘by a different philosophy and a different religion, Upon 
that delicate and variable composition known as the human 
soul, how many forces which we do not suspect have left 
their imprint! How many unobserved and latent causes 
are involved in our virtues and ii our faults! The con- 
scious and determined influence of the teacher is not, 
perhaps, the most potent. In conjunction with him are 
at work, obscurely but effectively, innumerable agents, 
besides personal effort and what is produced by the original 
energy of the individual. 
We see what a history of education would be: a sort 
of philosophy of history, to which nothing would be for- 
eign, and which would scrutinize in its most varied and 
most trifling causes, as well as in its most.profound sources, 
the moral. life of humanity.

INTRODUCTION. xi 
Wuat aN Exvementary History or PEpacocy sHOULD 
px.—— Wholly different is the limited and modest purpose 
of history of pedagogy, which proposes merely to set 
forth the doctrines and the methods of educators properly 
so called. In this more limited sense, education is reduced 
to the premeditated action which the will of one man 
exercises over other men in order to instruct them and 
train them. It is the reflective auxiliary of the natural 
development of the human soul. To.what can be done 
by nature and by ‘the blind and fatal influences which 
sport with human destiny, education adds the concurrence 
of art, that is, of the reason, attentive and _self-possessed, 
which voluntarily and consciously applies to the training 
of the soul principles whose truth has been recognized, 
and methods whose efficiency has been tested by expe- 
rience. . 
Even thus limited, the history of pedagogy still presents 
to our inquiry a vast field to be explored. There is scarcely 
a subject that has provoked to the same degree as educa- 
tion the best efforts of human thinking. Note the cata- 
logue of educational works published in French, which 
Buisson has recently prepared.! Though incomplete, this 
list contains not less than two thousand titles; and prob- 
ably educational activity has been more fruitful, and has 
, been given a still greater extension in Germany than in 
France. This activity is due to the fact, first of all, that

phie. :

xii INTRODUCTION. 
educational questions, brought into fresh notice with each 
generation, exercise over the minds of men an irresistible 
and perennial attraction; and also to the fact that parent- 
hood inspires a taste for such inquiries, and, a thing that 
is not always fortunate, leads to the assumption of some 
competence in such matters; and finally to the very nature 
of educational problems, which are not to be solved by 
abstract and independent reasoning, after the fashion of 
mathematical problems, but which, vitally related to the 
nature and the destiny of man, change and vary with the 
fluctuations of the psychological and the moral doctrines 
of. which they are but the consequences. ‘To different 
systems of psychology correspond different systems of 
education. An idealist, like Malebranche, will not reason 
upon education after the manner of a sensationalist like 
Locke. In the same way there is in every system of morals 
the germ of a characteristic and original system of educa- 
tion. A mystic, like Gerson, will not assign to education 
the same end as a practical and positive writer like Herbert 
Spencer. Hence a very great diversity in systems, or. at 
least an infinite variety in the shades of educational opinion. 
Still farther, educational activity may manifest itself in 
different ways, either in doctrines and theories or in 
methods and practical applications. The historian of ped- 
agogy has not merely to make known the general concep-~ 
tions which the philosophers of educaticn have in turn 
submitted to the approbation of men. If he wishes to 
make his work complete, he must give a detailed accoung

of what has been accomplished, and make an actual study 
of the educational establishments which have been founded 
at different periods by those who. have organized instruction. 
Pedagogy is a complex affair, and there are many ways 
of writing its history. One of these which has been too 
little considered, and which would surely be neither the 
least interesting nor the least. fruitful, would consist in 
studying, not the great writers on education and their 
doctrines, not the great teachers and their methods, but 
pupils themselves. If it were possible to relate in minute 
detail, supposing that history would furnish us the neces- 
sary information on this point, the manner in which a great 
or a good man has been educated; if an analysis could be 
made of the different influences which have been involved 
in the formation of talent or in.the development of virtue 
in the case of remarkable individuals; if it were possible, 
in a word, to reproduce through exact and personal biogra- 
phies the toil, the slow elaboration whence have issued at . 
different periods solidity of character, rectitude of purpose, 
and minds endowed with judicial fairness; the result would. 
be a useful and eminently practical work, something analo- 
gous to what a history of logic would be, in which there 
should be set forth not the abstract rules and the formal 
Jaws for the search after truth, but the successful experi- 
ments and the brilliant discoveries which have little by 
little constituted the patrimony of science. ‘This perhaps 
would be the best of logies because it is real and in action ; 
and also the best of treatises on pedagogy, since there

might be learned from it, not general truths, which are 
often of difficult application and of nncertain utility, but 
practical means. and living methods whose happy and effi- 
cient applications would be seen in actual use. 
We have just traced the imaginary plan of a history of 
pedagogy rather than the exact outline of the series of 
Jessons which this book contains. However, we have 
approached this ideal as nearly as we have been able, by 
attempting to group about the principal philosophical and 
moral ideas the systems of education which they have 
inspired ; by endeavoring to retain whatever is essential ; 
by adding to the first rapid sketches studied and elaborate 
portraits; by ever mingling with the expositions of doc- 
trines and the analysis of important works the study of 
practical methods and the examination of actual institu- 
tions; and, finally, by penetrating the thought of the 
great educators, to learn from them how they became such, 
and by following them, as they have united practice with 
theory, in the particular systems of education which they 
have directed with success.?

historian of pedagogy with the idea of dividing his work, 
and of distributing his studies into several series. For 
example, it would be possible to write the history of educa- 
tion in general by itself, and then the history of instruction, 
which is but an element of education. As education itself 
comprises three parts, physical education, intellectual edu- 
eation, and moral education, there would be an opportu- 
nity fer three series of distinct studies on these different 
subjects. But these divisions would present grave incon- 
veniences. In general, the opinions of an educator are 
not susceptible of division; there is a connection between 
his manner of regarding the matter of instruction and the 
solution he gives to educational questions proper. One 
mode of thinking pervades his theories or his practice in 
the matter of moral discipline, and his ideas on intellectual 
edueation. It is, then, necessary to consider each of the 
different systems of education as a whole. 
Perhaps a better order.of division would be that which, 
without zegard to chronological order, should distinguish 
all pedagogical doctrines and applications into a certain 
number of schools, and connect all educators with certain 
general tendencies: as the ascetic tendency, that of the 
fathers of the church, for example, and of the middle 
ages; thé utilitarian tendency of Locke, and of a great 
number’ of moderns; the pessimism of Port Royal, the 
optimism of Fénelon; the literary school of the humanists 
of. the: Renaissance, and the scientific school of Diderat 
and af Cendorcet. Such a mode of procedure would have
-P-A-G-E-16
xvi INTRODUCTION. 
its interest, because in the manifestations of educational 
thought so apparently different it would sharply distin- 
guish certain uniform principles which reappear at all 
periods of history; but this would be rather a philosophy 
of the history of education than a simple history of 
pedagogy. 
The best we can do; then, is to follow the chronological 
order and to study in turn the educators of antiquity, 
those of the middle ages, of the Renaissance, and of 
modern times. ‘We shall interrogate in succession those 
who have become eminent as teachers and educators, and 
ask of each how he has solved for himself the various 
portions of the problems of education. Besides being 
more simple and more natural, this order has the advan- 
tage of showing us the progress of education as it has 
gradually risen from instinct to reflection, from nature to’ 
art, and after long periods of groping and many halts, 
ascending from humble beginnings to a complete and defi- 
nite organization. This plan also exhibits to us the beau- 
tiful spectacle of a humanity in a state of ceaseless growth. 
At first, instruction comprised but few subjects, at the 
same time that only a select few participated in it. Then 
there was a simultaneous though gradual extension of the 
domain of knowledge which must be acquired, of the 
moral qualities demanded by the struggle for existence, 
and of the number of men who are called to be instructed 
and educated,—the ideal being, as Comenius has_ said, 
that ‘all-may learn and that everything may be taught.

Unniry or tHe History or Prpacocy. — The history of 
pedagogy is henceforth to form a part of the course of 
study for the primary normal schools of France. It has 
been included in the prescribed list of subjects for the third 
year, under this title: History of Pedagogy, — Principal 
educators and their doctrines; Analysis of the most important 
works. . 
Is argument necessary to justify the place which has 
been assigned to this study? In the first place, the history 
of pedagogy possesses great interest from the fact that 
it is closely connected with the general history of thought 
and.also with the philosophic explication of human actions. 
Certainly, pedagogical doctrines are neither fortuitous 
opinions’ nor events without significance. On the one hand, 
they have their causes and their principles in moral, reli- 
gious, and political beliefs, of which they are the faithful 
image; ‘on the other, they are instrumental in the train- 
ing of mind and in the formation of manners. -Back of 
the Ratio Studiorum of the Jesuits, back of the Emile 
of Rousseau, ‘there distinctly appears a complete religion, 
a complete philosophy. In the classical studies organ- 
ized by: the humanists of the Renaissance we see the 
dawn of that literary brilliancy which distinguished the 
century’ of Louis XIV., and so in the scientific studies 
preached a hundred years ago by Diderot and by Condorcet 
there was’a preparation for the positive spirit of our time. 
The education of the people is at once the consequence eee

xviii INTRODUCTION. 
of all that if believes and the source of all that it ia 
destined to be. 
But there are other reasons which recommend the study 
ef educators and the reading of their works. The his- 
tory of pedagogy is a necessary introduction to pedagogy 
itself. It should be studied, not for purposes of erudi- 
tion or for mere curiosity, but with a practical purncce 
Ctor the sake of finding in it the permanent truth: 
aye the essentials of a definite theory of edr ] 
The desirable thing just now is not perhaps so muck’ 
to find new ideas, as properly to comprehend those which 
are already current; to choose from among them. and 
a choice once having been made, to make a rest: 
te apply them to use. When we consider w: 
tiality all that has been conceived or practisec! 
to the nineteenth century, or when we see cle»... 
our predecessors have left us to do in the wev of so- 
sequences to deduce, of incomplete or obscur 
generalize or to illustrate, and especially of 
tendencies to reconcile, we may well inquire 
have really left us to discover. 
It is. profitable to study even the chimeras ard ++ - 
educational errors of our predecessors. In fact, 
are so many marked experiments which contribute 
progress of our methods by warning us of the 
which we should shun. A thorough analysis o. un

to which the abuse of the principle of nature leads us

  INTRODUCTION. , xix 
is no less instructive than meditation on the wisest 
precepts of Montaigne: or of. Port Royal. 
In truth, for him who has an exact knowledge of the 
educators of past centuries, the work of constructing a 
system of education is more than half done. It remains 
only to co-ordinate the scattered truths which have been 
collected from their works by assimilating them through 
personal reflection, and by making them fruitful through 
psychological analysis and moral faith. . 
Let it be observed that as studied by the men who 
first eonceived and practised them, pedagogical methods 
present themselves to our examination with a sharpness 
of outline that is surprising. Innovators lend to what~ 
ever they invent a personal emphasis, something life-like 
and occasionally extravagant; but it is exactly this which 
permits us the better to comprehend their thought, and 
the more completely to discover its truth or its falsity. 
“However, it is not alone the intellectual advantage 
which recommends the history of pedagogy; it is also 
the moral stimulus which will be derived from the study. 
For the seke of encouraging to noble efforts the men 
and women who are our teachers, is it of no moment 
to present to them the names of Comenius, Rollin, and 
Pestalozzi as men who have attained such high excellence 
in their profession? Will not the teacher who each day 
resumes. his heavy burden be revived and sustained? 
Will he not enter his class-room, where so many diffi- 
culties‘ and toils await him, a better and a stronger man

if his imagination teems with articulate memories of those 
who, in the past, have opened for him the way, and 
shown him by their example how to walk in it? By 
the marvellous agency of electricity we are now able tc 
transport material and mechanical power, and to cause 
its transfer across space without regard to distance. But 
by reading and by meditation we are able to do some- 
thing analogous to this in the moral world; we are able 
to borrow from the ancients, across the centuries, some- 
thing of the moral energy that inspired them, and to 
make live again in our own hearts some of their virtues 
of devotion and faith. Doubtless a brief history of 
pedagogy could not, from this point of view, serve as 
a substitute for the actual reading of the authors in 
question; but it is a preparation for this work and 
inspires a taste for it. 
We are warranted in saying, then, that the utility of 
the history of pedagogy blends with the utility of ped- 
agogy itself. : To-day it is no longer necessary for us to 
offer any proof on this point. Pedagogy, long neglected 
even in our country, has regained its standing; nay 
more, it has become the fashion., ‘‘ France is becoming 
addicted to pedagogy” was a remark recently made by 
one of the men who, of our day, will have contributed 
most to excite and also to direct the taste for peda- 
gogical studies." The words pedagogue, pedagogy, have

INTRODUCTION. _ xxi 
encountered dangers in the history of our language. 
Littré tells us that the word pedagogue ‘is most often 
used in a bad sense.” On the other hand, we shall 
see, if we consult his dictionary, that several, years ago 
the sense of the word ‘pedagogy was not yet fixed, 
since. it is there defined as ‘‘the moral education of 
children.’’? To-day, not only in language, but in facts and 
in institutions, the fate of pedagogy is settled. Of course 
we must neither underrate it nor attribute to it a sovereign 
and. omnipotent efficiency that it does not have. We 
might freely say of pedagogy what Sainte-Beuve said 
of logic: The best is that which does not argue in its 
own favor; which is not enamoured of itself, but which 
modestly recognizes the limits of its power. The best 
is that which we make for ourselves, not that which we 
Jearn from books. 
Even with this reserve, the teaching of pedagogy. is 
destined to render important services to the cause of 
education, and education, let us be assured, is in the 
way of acquiring a fresh importance day by day. This 
is due to the fact, first, that under a liberal govern- 
ment, and in a republican society, it is more and 
more necessary that the citizens shall be instructed and 
enlightened. (Liberty is a dangerous thing unless it has 
Cinstruetion for a counterpoise) Moreover, we must rec- 
ollect that in our day, among those occult coadjutors of 
which we have spoken, and which at all times add their 
action to that of education proper, some have lost their

infliietice, while others, so far from co-operating in this 
Movement, oppose it and compromise it. On the one 
hand, religion has seen her influence curtailed. She is 
no longer, as she once was, the tutelary power under 
_ Whose shadow the rising generations peacefully matured. 
It is necessary that education, through the progress ~ 
the reasén and through the reflective development 
thidrality, should compensate for the waning influence or 
feligion. 
On the other hand, social conditions, the very progress 
of civil and political liberty, the growing independence 
accorded the child in the family; the multiplication of 
books, good and bad, all these collateral agents of educa- 
tion are not always compliant and useful aids. ‘They 
would prove the accomplices of a moral decadence did 
not our teachers make an effort as much more vigorous 
to sffeet the will and the heart, as well as the mind, 
in order to’ establish character, and thus assure the re- 
cuperation of our country.

A SKETCH OF THE LIFE OF GABRIEL 
COMPAYRE2 
  GaprieL Compayri was born Jan. 2, 1843, at Albi, a 
city of Southern France, containing about fifteen thousand 
inhabitants, and the capital of the province of Tarn. His 
early education was received from his father, a man of 
sterling character, and the author of a book entitled, His- 
torical Studies Concerning the Albigenses. 
He passed from his father’s care to the collage of Castres, 
then to the ycée of Toulouse, and finally to the lycée Louis- 
le-Grand at Paris. His fellow-pupils recall with pleasure 
his triumphs at these institutions of learning. His brilliant 
intellectual powers, his vivid imagination, his well-stored 
memory, and his unwearied industry, marked him as des- 
tined to render signal services to his race. ‘ 
He entered the Ecole Normale Supérieure in 1862. His 
‘tastes led him to philosophical studies; indeed, he had 
already manifested a strong tendency to moral and intel- 
lectual science. Yet his intensely practical nature could 
not long remain satisfied with metaphysical subtleties where 
he found no sure foot-hold. He became a warm advocate 
of experimental methods, and of the Baconian philosophy. 
He set himself to a study of man as he appears in society

and in the family ; to the analysis of his emotions and his 
acts, and to the deduction, from these analyses, of those 
rules which ought to preside over his conduct and his intel- 
lectual and moral development. 
He graduated from the normal school in 1865, and was 
immediately appointed professor of philosophy at the lycée 
of Pau. <A lecture upon Rousseau, which he delivered here, 
brought upon him. the severe condemnation of the ultra- 
montane party, and involved him in a controversy which 
has continued to the present time. 
In 1868, having been made a fellow of the University, he 
was sent to the lycée of Poitiers. At this place he mani- 
fested his sympathy for the common people by a course of 
‘lectures to workmen on moral subjects. About this time 
he received honorable mention from the Academy for an 
eloquent eulogy upon Rousseau, in which he carefully por- 
strayed the influence of Rousseau upon the government of 
his country and upon methods of school instruction, giving 
him full credit for the reform in both. 
From this time forward Compayré’s life has been filled 
with labors and with honors. In addition to his pro- 
fessional duties and philosophical writings, he has madé 
eareful study of the social and political questions of his 
country. 
Promoted from one post of honor to another, on the 
14th of July, 1880, he was appointed Chevalier of the 
Legion of Honor. 
In 1874 he presented his theme for his doctor’s degree 
upon the Philosophy of David: Hume, a work of the highest

philosophical thought and language, which received a prize 
from the Academy. 
Between 1874 and 1880 his lectures were largely devoted 
to the subjects most closely connected with modern thought. 
A. Study of Darwinism, The Psychology of a Child, Educa- 
tional Principles, are subjects that indicate the sweep of 
his investigations. The brilliancy of his style, the liber- 
ality of his opinions, and the extent of his learning have 
exposed him to bitter attacks from those who envy his 
powers and disbelieve his doctrines; yet his popularity has 
continually increased, and the young professor has become 
a great power in the party of the republic, to whose cause 
he early devoted himself. 
The works which he published during’ this period were 
numerous. He translated with great care, adding valua- 
ble matter of his, own: Bain’s Inductive and Deductive 
Logic, Huxley’s Hume, His’ Life and Philosophy, and 
Locke’s Thoughts on Education. His most considerable 
work js his History of the Doctrine of Education in France 
since the Sixteenth Century, a work of two volumes, pub- 
lished in 1879, which reached its fourth edition in France 
in 1883, has been translated entire into German, and 
from which numerous extracts have been made for the 
educational journals of England and America. If we add 
to these labors his work upon the Revue Philosophique, 
and the Dictionnaire de Pédagogie,’ we shall understand 
why he was called to Paris in 1881, by the Minister of 
Public Instruction, to aid in founding the Ecole Normale 
Supérieure des Institutrices, de Fontenay-auz-Roses. He
-P-A-G-E-26

successfully arranged the course of instruction for this 
school, In the same year he assisted in the organization 
of a new school at Savres, which prepares young teachers 
for the course of instruction in the normal schools. 
In 1880 he published his Manual of Civil and Mora. 
Instruction, in two courses, or parts. This book has had 
a remarkable career. In less than three years more than 
three hundred thousand copies of the first part, and over 
five hundred thousand of the second part, were sold. 
In 1882, in conjunction with a friend, M. A. Delplan, 
an author of merit, he published his Civil and Moral Lec- 
tures. In 1883 he published a Course of Civil Instruction 
for normal schools. 
Compayré entered political life in 1881, having been 
elected deputy from the arrondissement of Lavaur in Tarn. 
He occupies a distinguished position among the men of 
to-day; his character, his talents, his popularity, and his 
devotion to the cause of civil and intellectual freedom, 
give him the assurance of a place no less important among 
the men of the future. . 
In his personal appearance Compayré combines the 
scholar and the man of the world. His dark hair, parted 
in the middle, is combed back from a forehead very high 
and very broad. His eye is bright and piercing, and his 
face, clean shaven except upon the upper lip, bears the 
impress of both his ingenuousness and his indomitable 
perseverance.

ANALYTICAL SUMMARY, 
1. Prinmonary Consiperations. — A German historian of 
philosophy. begins his work by asking this question: ‘‘ Was 
Adam a philosopher?” In the same way certain historians 
of pedagogy begin by learned researches upon the education 
of savages. We shall not carry our investigations so far 
back. Doubtless from the day when a human family began 
its existerice, from the day when a father and a mother began 
to love their children, education had an existence. But there 
is very little practical interest in studying these obscure be- 
ginnings of pedagogy. It is a matter of erudition and curi-

osity.1 Besides the difficulty of gathering up the faint traces 
of primitive education, there would be but little profit in 
painfully following the slow gropings of primeval man. In 
truth, the history of pedagogy dates but from the period 
relatively recent, when human thought, in the matter of edu- 
cation, substituted reflection for instinct, art for blind nature. 
So we shall hasten to begin the study of pedagogy among 
the classical peoples, the Greeks and the Romans, after hav- 
ing thrown a rapid glance over some Eastern nations consid- 
ered either in their birthplace and remote origin, or in their 
more recent development. 
2. Tan Pepacocy or tae Hinpoos.—It would not be 
worth our while to enter into details respecting a civilization 
so different from our own as that of the Hindoos. But we 
should not forget that we are in part the descendants of that 
people, and that we belong to the same ethnic group, an@ 
that the European languages are derived from theirs. 
8. Potrricat Casts anp Rezicious Pantanism. — The 
spirit of caste, from the social point of view, and pantheism, 
from the religious point of view, are the characteristics of 
Hindoo society. The Indian castes constituted hereditary 
  
1 A knowledge of the mental and moral condition of savages serves the 
invaluable purpose of showing what education has accomplished for the 
human race. There would be much Jess grumbling at the tax-gatherer if 
men could clearly conceive the condition of societies where no taxes are 
levied. To know what education has actually done we need to know the 
condition of societies unaffected by systematic education. Such a book as 
Lubhock’s Origin.of Civilization is a helpful introduction to the history of 
education. Whoever reads such a book carefully will be confronted with 
this probleth: ‘How is it that intellectual inertness, amounting almost to 
stupidity, ‘is frequently the.concomitant of an acute and persistent sense, 
training? Besides, savage tribes are historical illustrations of what has 
been produced on a large scale by “ following Nature.’ (P.) :
-P-A-G-E-31
  EDUCATION IN ANTIQUITY. 3 
classes where social rank and special vocation were deter- 
mined, not by free choice, but by the accident of birth. The 
consequence of this was an endless routine, with no care 
either for the individuality, or the personal talents, or the 
inclination of children, and without the possibility of rising 
by personal effort above one’s rank in life.! On the other 
hand, religious ideas came to restrict, within the limits where 
it was already imprisoned, the activity of the young Hindoo. 
God is everywhere present; he manifests himself in all the 
phenomena of heaven and earth, in the sun and in the stars, 
in the Himalayas and in the Ganges; he penctrates and ani- 
mates everything ; the things of sense are but the changing 
and ephemeral vestments of the unchangeable being. ‘‘ With 
this pantheistic conception of the world and of life, the 
thought and the will of the Hindoo perished in the mystic 
contemplation of the soul. To become master of one’s in- 
clinations ; to abandon every terrestrial thought; after this 
life to lose one’s identity, and to be annihilated by absorp- 
tion in the divine nature; to prepare one’s self by macera- 
tions and expiations for complete submersion in the original 
principle of all being, — this is the highest wisdom, the true 
happiness of the Hindoo, the ideal of all serious education.”* 
  
1 There is an argument for caste in the modern fiction of a “ beautiful 
économy of Natiire,” which plants human beings in society as it does trees 
in the earth, and thus makes education consist in the action of environment 
Upon man: and in the reaction of man upon his environment. To support 
existence, man needs certain endowments; but the force of circumstances 
erentes these very endowments. One man is predestined to be a Red 
InAiati, another a Bushman, and still another an accountant; and in each 
ease the function of education is to adapt the man to the place where 
Nature has fixed him. This modern justification of caste is adroitly 
worked out by Mr. Spencer in the first chapter of his Education. (P.)

4 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
4, Errects on Epvucation. —It is easy to predict what 
education would become under the weight of these double 
chains, social and religious. While the ideal in our modern 
societies is more and more to enfranchise the individual, and 
to create for him personal freedom and self-consciousness, 
the effort of the Hindoo Brahmins consisted above all in 
crushing out all spontaneity, in abolishing individual predi- 
lections, by preaching the doctrine of absolute self-renuncia- 
tion, of voluntary abasement, and of contempt for life. 
Man was thus born doubly a slave, — by his social condition, 
which predestinated him to the routine apprenticeship of his 
ancestral caste, and by his mysterious dependence on the 
divine being who absorbed in himself all real activity, and 
left to human beings only the deceptive and frail appearance 
of it. 
5. Bupputst Rerorm. — The Buddhist reform, which so 
profoundly affected Brahmanism at about the sixth century 
B.C., did not sensibly modify, from the educational point of 
view, the ideas of the Hindoos. Buddha also taught that 
the cause of evil resides in the passions of men, and that in 
order to attain moral peace, there is no other means to be 
employed than that of self-abnegation and of the renounce- 
ment of everything selfish and personal. 
6. ConversaTION oF BuppHA AND Purna. — One of the 
traditions which permit us the better to appreciate the origi- 
nal character, at once affecting and ingenuous, of Indian 
thought, is the conversation of Buddha with his disciple 
Purna about a journey the latter was going to undertake to 
the barbarians for the purpose of teaching them the new 
religion : — 
_‘ They are men,”’ said Buddha, ‘‘ who are fiery in temper, 
passionate, cruel, furious, insolent. If they openly address
-P-A-G-E-33
EDUCATION IN ANTIQUITY. 6 
you..in words which are malicious and ¢earse, and--become 
angry with:you, what will you think?” “ : 
‘sTf they address me fo my face in coarse and insolent 
terms, this is what I shall think: they are certainly good 
men who openly address me in malicious terms, but they will 
neither strike me with their hands nor stone me.” 
‘*But should they strike you with their hands and stone 
you, what will you think?” 
‘TI shall think tbat they are good men, gentle men, who 
strike me with their bands and stone me, but do not beat me 
with a club nor with a sword.” . 
‘¢ But if they beat you with a club and with a sword?” 
‘They are good men, gentle men, who beat me with a 
elub and with a sword, but they do not completely kill me.” 
«But if they were really to kill you?” 
‘* They-are good men, gentle men, who deliver me with so 
fitile pain from this body encumbered with defilements.” 
“Very good; Purna! You may live in the country of 
those barbarians. Go, Purna! Being liberated, liberate ; 
being consoled, console; having reached Nirvana thus made 
perfect, cause others to go there.” 1 
Whatever there ig to admire in such a strange system of 
morals should not blind us to the vices which resulted from 
its practical consequences: such as the abuse of passive 
resignation, the complete absence of the idea of right and of 
justice, and no active virtues. 
7. Errecrts on Epvucation. — Little is known of the 
actual state. of educational practice among the Hindoos, It 
may be said, however, that the Brahmins, the priests, had 
the exclusive charge of education. Woman, in absolute 
subjection to man, had no share whatever in instruction.

6 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
As to boys, it seems that in India there were always 
schools for their benefit; schools which were held in the 
open country under the shade of trees, or, in case of bad 
weather, under sheds. Mutual instruction has been prac- 
tised in India from the remotest antiquity; it is from here, 
in fact, that Andrew Bell, at the close of the eighteenth 
century, borrowed the idea of this mode of instruction. 
Exercises in writing were performed first upon the sand with 
a stick, then upon palm leaves with an iron style, and 
finally upon the dry leaves of the plane-tree with ink. In 
discipline there was a resort to corporal punishment ; besides 
the rod the teacher employed other original means of correc- 
tion; for example, he threw cold water on the offender. 
The teacher, moreover, was treated with a religious respect ; 
the child must respect him as he would Buddha himself. 
The higher studies were reserved for the priestly class, 
who, long before the Christian era, successfully cultivated 
rhetoric and logic, astronomy and the mathematics. 
8. Epvcation amone Tue Israz.ires. — ‘If ever a peo- 
ple has demonstrated the power of education, it is the people 
of Israel.” In fact, what a singular spectacle is offered us 
by that people, which, dispossessed of its own country for 
eighteen hundred years, has been dispersed among the 
nations without losing its identity, and has maintained its 
. existence without a country, without a government, and 
without a ruler, preserving with perennial energy its habits, 
its manners, and its faith! ‘Without losing sight of the part 
of that extraordinary vitality of the Jewish people, which is 
due to the natural endowments of the race, its tenacity 
temperament, and its wonderful activity of intelligence, i: 
just to attribute another part of it to the sound educatiu.s, 
  
  
  1Dittes, p. 49,

at onee religious and national, which the ancient Hebrews 
have transmitted by tradition to their descendants. 
9. Epucation, Reticious anp NatTIoNAL, DURING THE 
Prooatrve Pertop. — The chief characteristic of the educa- 
tion of the Hebrews in the earliest period of their history is 
that it was essentially domestic. During the whole Biblical 
period there is no trace of public schools, at least for young 
children. Family life is the origin of that primitive society 
where the notion of the state is almost unknown, and where 
God is the real king. 
The child was to become the faithful servant of Jehovah. 
To this end it was not needful that he should be learned. 
It was only necessary that he should learn through language 
and the instructive example of his parents the moral precepts 
and the religious beliefs of the nation. It has been very 
justly said? that ‘‘ among all nations the direction impressed 
on education depends on the idea which they form of the 
perfect man. Among the Romans it is the brave soldier, 
inured to fatigue, and readily yielding to discipline; among 
the Athenians it is the man who unites in himself the happy 
harmony of moral and physical perfection; among the 
Hebrews the perfect man is the pious, virtuous man, who is 
capable of attaining the ideal traced by God himself in these 
terms: ‘Ye shall be holy, for I the Lord your God am 
holy 17”? 
The discipline was harsh, as is proved by many passages 
in the Bible: ‘‘He that spareth his rod, hateth his son,” say 
the Proverbs; ‘but he that loveth him chasteneth him 
betimes.”* ‘* Withhold not correction from the child, for if

"8 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
thou beatest him with the rod, he shall not die. Thou shal 
beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul from hell.” 
And still more significant: ‘*Chasten thy son while there is 
hope, and let not thy soal spare for his erying.”? 
Only boys, it seems, learned to read and write. As te 
girls, they were taught to spin, to weave, to prepare food for 
the table, to superintend the work of the household, and 
also to sing and to dance. 
In a word, intellectual culture was but an incident in the 
primitive education of the Hebrews; the great thing, in their 
eyes, was moral and religious instruction, and education in 
love of country. Fathers taught their children the nation’s 
history, and the great events that had marked the destiny 
of the people of God. That series of events celebrated 
by the great feasts which were often renewed, and in which 
the children participated, served at once to fill their hearts 
with gratitude to God and with love for their country. 
10. Procruss or Porutar Instrvction. —It is not easy 
to conceive to what extent the zeal for instruction was devel- 
oped among the ancient Jews in the years that followed the 
advent of Christianity. From being domestic, as it had been 
up to that time, Jewish education became public. Besides, 
it was no longer sufficient to indoctrinate children with good 
principles and wholesome moral habits; they must also be 
instructed. From the first centuries of the Christian era, 
the Israelites approached our modern ideal, with respect to 
making education obligatory and universal. . Like every 
’ brave nation that has been vanquished, whose energy has 
survived defeat, like the Prussians after Jena, or the 
French after 1870, the Jews sought to defend themselves 
against the effects of conquest by a great intellectual effort, 
  
1 Prov. xxiii. 13, 14. 2 Prov. xix. 18.

and to régain their lost ground by the development of popu- 
lar instruction. : 
a1. Orcanzirton or Scuoorts. —In the year 64, the 
high priest, Joshua Ben Gamala, imposed on each town, 
under pain of excommunication, the obligation to support a 
school. If the town is cut in two by a river, and there is 
no means of transit by a safe bridge, a school must be estab- 
lished on each side. Even to-day we are far from having 
realized; as regards the number of schools and of teachers, 
this rule stated in the Talmud: If the number of children 
does not exceed twenty-five, the school shall be conducted 
by a single teacher; for more than twenty-five, the town 
shall: employ an assistant; if the number exceeds forty, 
" there shall be two masters. 
12. “Reseecr ror Tracuers.—TIn that ancient time, what 
an exalted and noble conception men had of teachers, 
“those true guardians of the city”! Even then, how exact- 
ing were the requirements made of them! ‘ But, on the other 
hand, how they were esteemed and respected! The Rabbins 
required that the schoolmaster should be married; they 
mistrusted teachers who were not at the same time heads of 
families. As it possible to enforce the advantages of matu- 
rity. and experience more delicately than in this beautiful 
language? ‘* He who learns of a young master is like a man 
who eats green grapes, and drinks wine fresh from the 
press; but he who has a master of mature years is like a 
man. who eats ripe and delicious grapes, and drinks old 
wine.” “Mildness, patience, and unselfishness were recom- 
mended*as the ruling virtues of the teacher. ‘If your 
teather and your father,” says the Talmud, ‘have need of 
your ‘assistance, help your teacher before helping your 
father, for the latter has given you only the life of this

world, while the former has secured for you the life of the 
world to come.”? 
18. Mernop anp Discrpiive. — The child entered school 
at the age of six. ‘‘If a child below the age of six is 
brought to your school,” says the Talmud, ‘‘ you need not 
receive him”; and to indicate that after that age it is proper 
to regain the lost time, the Talmud adds, ‘‘ After the age of 
six, receive the child, and load him like an ox.” On the 
contrary, other authorities of the same period, more judicious 
and far-seeing, recommend moderation in tasks, and say 
that it is necessary'to treat ‘‘ the young according to their 
strength, and the grown-up according to theirs.” 
There was taught in the Jewish schools, along with reading 
’ and writing,? a little of natural history, and a great deal of 
geometry and astronomy. Naturally, the Bible was the first 
book put in the hands of children. The master interspersed 
moral lessons with the teaching of reading. He made a 
special effort to secure a correct pronunciation, and multi- 
plied his explanations in order to make sure of being under- 
stood, repeating his comments even to the four-hundredth 
time if it were necessary. It seems that the methods were 
suggestive and attractive, and the discipline relatively mild. 
There were but few marks of the proverbial severity of the 
ancient times. ‘‘ Children,” says the Talmud, ‘‘ should be 
punished with one hand, and caressed with two.” The 
Christian spirit, the spirit of him who had said ‘‘ suffer the 
1 Onsimilar grounds, Alexander declared that he owed more to Aristotle 
his teacher, than to Philip his father. (P.) 
2 What were the methods followed in teaching reading and writing? 
We are told by Renan in his Vie de Jésus that ‘‘ Jesus doubtless learned to 
read and write according to the method of the East, which consists in 
putting into the hands of the child a book which he repeats in concert with 
his comrades till he knows it by heart.”

little children. to come unto me,” had affected the Jews them- 
selves. However, corporal punishment was tolerated to a 
certain extent, but, strange to say, only for children above 
the age of eleven. In case of disobedience, a pupil above 
‘that age might be deprived of food, and even struck with a 
strap of shoe-leather. 
14. Excuusrve anp Jeatous Spirir.— Some reservation 
must accompany the encomiums justly due Jewish education. 
‘With respect to the rest of the human race, the Jewish spirit 
was Inean, narrow, and malevolent. The Israelites of this 
day have retained something of these jealous and exclusive 
tendencies. At the beginning of the Christian era, the fierce 
and haughty patriotism of the Jews led them to proscribe 
whatever was of Gentile origin, whatever had not the 
sanction of the national tradition. Nothing of Greek or 
Roman culture penetrated this closed world! The Jewish 
doctors covered with the same contempt him who raises 
hogs and him who teaches his son Greek science. 
15.. Epvcation amone tHe Cuinese.— We have. at- 
tempted. to throw into relief the educational practices of 
two Eastern nations to which the civilization of the 
West is most intimately related. A few words will suf- 
fice for the other primitive societies whose history is too 
little known, and whose civilization is too remote from 
our own, to make their plans of education anything more 
than an object of curiosity. 
  
1 This statement needs qualifying. ‘‘In nearly all the families of high 
rank,” says the Dictionnaire de Pédagogie (1° Partie, Article Jurrs), tha 
daughters spoke Greek. The Rabbins did not look with any favor upon 
the study of profane philosophy; but notwithstanding their protests, there 
were many devoted readers of Plato and Aristotle. It is said that among 
the pupils of the celebrated Gamaliel there were five hundred who studied 
the philosophy and the literature of Greece.” (P.)

‘12 ©. HE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
China has been civilized from time immemorial, and at 
every period of her long history she has preserved her 
national characteristics. For more than three thousand 
years an absolute uniformity has characterized this immo- 
bile people. Everything is regulated by tradition. Edu- 
cation is mechanical and formal. The preoccupation of 
teachers is to cause their pupils to acquire a mechanical 
ability, a regular and sure routine. They care more for 
appearances, for a decorous manner of conduct, than for 
a searching and profound morality. Life is but a cere- 
monial, minutely determined and punctually followed. 
There is no liberty, no glow of spontaneity. Their art 
is characterized by conventional refinement and by a 
prettiness that seems mean; there is nothing of the grand 
and imposing. By their formalism, the Chinese educa- 
tors are the Jesuits of the East. 
16. Lio-rszm anp Knune-1sze. — Towards the sixth cen- 
tury B.c. two reformers appeared in China, L&o-tsze and 
Khung-tsze. The first represents the spirit of emancipa- 
tion, of progress, of the pursuit of the ideal, of protest 
against routine. He failed. The second, on the contrary, 
who became celebrated under the name of Confucius, and 
to whom tradition ascribes more than three thotsand 
personal disciples, secured the triumph of his ideas of 
practical, utilitarian morality, founded upon the authority 
of the State and that of the family, as well as upon the 
interest of the individual. 
‘A quotation from La&o-tsze will prove that human 
thought, in the sixth century B.c., had reached a high 
mark in China: — 
‘Certain bad rulers would have us believe that 
heart and the spirit of man should be left empty,
-P-A-G-E-41
EDUCATION IN ANTIQUITY. : ‘13 
that instead his stomach should be filled; that his bones 
should be: strengthened rather than the power of his will; 
that we ‘should always desire to have the people remain 
in a state of ignorance, for then their demands would 
be few. It is difficult, they say, to govern a people that 
are too wise. 
‘‘These doctrines are directly opposed to what is due 
to humanity. Those in authority should come to ‘the aid 
of the people by means of oral and written instruction ; 
so far from oppressing them and treating them as slaves, 
they should dé them good in every possible way.” ’ 
In other words, it is by enlightening the people, and 
by an honest devotion to their interests, that one be- 
comes worthy to’ govern them. 
If the Chinese have not fully profited by these wise and 
exalted counsels, it appears that at least they have at- 
tempted..to make instruction general. Huc, a Chinese 
missionary, boldly declares that China is the country of 
all countries where primary instruction is most widely dif- 
fused. .To fhe same effect, a German writer affirms that 
in China there is not a village so miserable, nor a ham- 
let so unpretending, as not to be provided with a school 
of’some kind. In a country of tradition, like China, 
we ean infer what once existed from what exists to-day. 
But that instruction which is so widely diffused is wholly

17. Epvcation aMona THE Orner Nations OF THE 
Easr.— Of all the oriental nations, Egypt is the one in 
which intellectual culture seems to have reached the high- 
est point, but only among men of a privileged class. 
Here, as in India, the priestly class monopolized the 
learning of the day; it jealously guarded the depository 
of mysterious knowledge which it communicated only to 
the kings. The common people, divided into working 
classes, which were destined from father to son to the 
same social status, learned scarcely more than was nec. 
essary in order to practise their hereditary trades and 
to be initiated into the religious beliefs. 
In the more military but less theocratic nation, the 
Persian, efforts were made in favor of a general edu- 
cation. The religious dualism which distinguished Ormuzd, 
the principle of good, from Abriman, the principle’ of 
evil, and which promised the victory to the former, made 
it the duty of each’ man to contribute to this final vic- 
tory by devoting himself to a life of virtue. Hence arose 
noble efforts to attain physical and moral perfection. The 
education of the Persians in temperance and frugality has 
excited the admiration of certain Greek writers, especially 
Xenophon, and there will be found in his Cyropedia a thrill- 
ing picture of the brave and noble manners of the ancient 
Persians.’ : 
  
10n a recent occasion Archdeacon Farrar referred to Persian edu- 
cation as follows: ‘We boast of our educational ideal. Is it nearly 
as high in some essentials as that even of some ancient and heathen 
nations long centuries before Christ came? The ancient Persians were 
worshippers of fire and of the sun; most of their children would have 
been probably unable to pass the most elementary examination in 
physiology, but assuredly the Persian ideal might be worthy of our 
study. At the age of fourteen—the age when we turn our children 
adrift from school, and do nothing more for them— the Persians gave

EDUCATION IN ANTIQUITY. 15 
On the whole, the history of pedagogy among the people of 
the East offers us but few examples to follow. That which, 
in different degrees, characterizes primitive education is that 
it is the privilege of certain classes ; that woman is most gen- 
erally excluded from its benefits ; that in respect of the com- 
mon people it is scarcely more than the question of an 
apprenticeship to a trade, or of the art of war, or of a 
preparation for the future life; that no appeal is made to 
the free energy of individuals, but that the great masses of 
the people in antiquity have generally lived under the har- 
assing oppression of religious conceptions, of fixed tradi- 
tions, and of political despotism. 
(18. Anaryrica, Summary.—Speaking generally, the edu- 
cation of the primitive nations of the East had the following 
characteristics : — . 
1. It was administered by the hieratic class. This was 
due to the fact that the priests were the only men of learn- 
ing, and consequently the only men who could teach. 
2. The knowledge communicated was in the main relig: 
ious, ethical, and prudential, and the final purpose of instruc- 
tion was good conduct. 
8. As the matter of instruction was knowledge bearing 
the sanction of authority, the learner was debarred from free 
inquiry, and the general tendency was towards immobility. 
4, As the knowledge of the day was embodied in lan- 
guage, the process of learning consisted in the interpretation 
of speech, and so involved a large and constant use of the 
  
their. young uobles the four best masters whom they could find to 
teach their boys wisdom, justice, temperance, and courage — wisdom 
. inelnding worship, justice including the duty of unswerving  truthful- 
ness. through life, temperance including mastery over sensual tempta- 
Wons, courage including a free mind _ opposed to all things coupled 
with: guilt.’ (P.)

memory; and this literal memorizing of the principles and 
rules of conduct promoted stability of character. 
5. As the purpose of instruction was guidance, there was 
‘no appearance of the conception that one main purpose of 
education is discipline or culture. 
6. The conception of education as a means of national 
regeneration had a distinct appearance among the. Jews; and 
among this people we find one form of compulsion, —— the 
obligation placed on towns to support schools. 
7. In Persia, the State appears for the first time as a dis- 
tinct agency in promoting education. 
8. In China, from time immemorial, scholarship has been 
made the condition for obtaining places in the civil service, 
and in consequence education has been made subordinate to 
examinations. 
9. Save to a limited extent among the Jews, woman was 
debarred from the privileges of education. 
10. In the main, education was administered so 4s to 
perpetuate class distinctions. There was no appearance of 
the conception that education is a universal right and a 
universal good.]

19. Greek Pepacoey.— Upon that privileged soil of 
Greece, in that brilliant Athens abounding in artists, poets, 
historians, and philosophers, in that rude Sparta celebrated 
for its discipline and manly virtues, education was rather the 
spontaneous fruit of nature, the natural product of diverse 
manners, characters, and races, than the premeditated result 
of a reflective movement of the human will. Greece, how- 
ever, had ‘its pedagogy, because it had its legislators and its 
philosophers, the first directing education in its practical 
details, the, second making theoretical inquiries into the 
essential principles underlying the development of the human

soul. In respect of education, as of everything else, the 
higher spiritual life of modern nations has been developed 
under the influence of Grecian antiquity.! 
20. ATHENIAN anp Spartan Epucation. — In the specta- 
cle presented to us by ancient Greece, the first fact that 
strikes us by its contrast with the immobility and unity of 
the primitive societies of the East, is a freer unfolding of the 
human faculties, and consequently a diversity in tendencies 
and manners. Doubtless, in the Greek republics, the indi- 
vidual is always subordinate to the State. Even in Athens, 
little regard is paid to the essential dignity of the human 
person. But the Athenian State differs profoundly from the 
Spartan, and consequently the individual life is differently 
understood and differently directed in these two great cities. 
At Athens, while not neglecting the body, the chief preoccu- 
: pation is the training of the mind; intellectual culture is 
pushed to an extreme, even to over-refinement; there is 
such a taste for fine speaking that it develops an abuse of 
language and reasoning which merits the disreputable name 
of sophistry. At Sparta, mind is sacrificed to body; physi- 
cal strength and military skill are the qualities most desired ; 
‘the sole care is the training of athletes and soldiers. Sol: 
and courage are the results of this one-sided educatior 
so are ignorance and brutality. Montaigne has throwr 
relief, not without some partiality for Sparta, these two con- 
trasted plans of education.

learned to unravel a sophistical argument and to. abate the 
imposture of insidiously twisted words; here, to extricate 
one’s self from the enticements of pleasure and to overcome 
the menaces of fortune and death by a manly courage. The 
Athenians busied themselves with words, but the Spartans 
with things ; with the former, there was a continual activity of 
the tongue ; with the latter, a continual activity of the soul.” 
The last remark is not just.. The daily exercises of the 
young Spartans, — jumping, running, wrestling, playing with — 
lances and at quoits,-— could not be regarded as intellectual 
occupations. On the other hand, in learning to talk, the 
young Athenians learned also to feel and to think. 
21. Tux,Scnoois or AruEeNs. —The Athenian legislator,’ 
Solon, had placed physical and intellectual training upon the 
same footing. Children, he said, ought, above everything 
else, to learn ‘‘ to swim and to read.” It seems that the 
education. of the body was the chief preoccupation of the 
Athenian republic. While the organization of schools for 
grammar and music was left to private enterprise, the State 
took 4 part ih the direction of the gymnasia. The director 
of ‘the gymnasium, or the gymnasiarch, was elected each 
year by the assembly of the people. Nevertheless, Athenian 
education became more and more a course in literary train- 
ing, especially towards the sixth century 3.c. 
The Athenian child remained in the charge of a nurse and 
an attendant up to his sixth or seventh year. At the age of 
seven, 4 pedagogue, that i is, a “ conductor of children,” 
usually a slave, was charged with the oversight of the child. 
Condiicted by his pedagogue, the pupil attended by turns the

and the school for music. The grammarian, who sometimes 
gave his lessons in the open air, in the streets and on the 
public squares, taught reading, writing, and mythology. 
Homer was the boy’s reading-book. Instruction in gymnas- 
ties was given in connection with instruction in grammar. 
Jt-was begun in the palestra and continued in the gymnasium. 
Instruction in music succeeded the training in grammar and 
gymuastics. The music-master, or citharist, first taught his 
pupils to sing, and then to play upon the stringed instru- 
ments, the lyre and the cithara. We know what value the 
Athenians attributed to music. Plato and Aristotle agree in 
thinking that the rhythm and harmony of music inspire the 
soul with the love of order, with harmoniousness, regularity, 
and a soothing of the passions, We must recollect, x 
over, that music held a large place in the actual life of 
Greeks. The laws were promulgated in song. It was neves- 
sary to sing in order to fulfil one’s religious duti:

Grammar, gymnastics, and music proper, represented’ the 
elementary instruction of the young Athenian. © But this 
instraction was reserved for citizens in easy circumstances. 
The -poor, according to the intentions of Solon, were to 
learn only reading, swimming, and a trade. The privilege 
of instruction became still more exclusive in the case of the

adult years.

high:rates of tuition, and teaching the art of speaking on 
every subject, and of making a plea for error and injustice 
just-as skilfully as for justice and truth, at the same time

Plato, and Aristotle were illustrious professors of ethics. 
Socrates had no regular school, but he grouped about him 
distinguished young men and initiated them into learning 
and virtue. The Academy of Plato and the Lyceum of Aris- 
totle wete great schools of philosophy, real private univer- 
sities, each directed by a single man. ‘The teaching given 
in these schools has traversed the ages, and has been pre- 
served in imperishable books. Moreover, those illustrious 
spirits of Greece have transmitted to us either methods or 
general ideas which the history of pedagogy should reverently 
collect, as the first serious efforts of human reflection on the 
art of education. 
23. Socrates: THE Socratic Mersop. — Socrates spent 
his life in teaching, and in teaching according to an original 
method, which has preserved his name. He had the genius 
of interrogation. To question all whom he met, either at the 
gymnasium or in the streets ; to question the sophists in order 
to convince them of their errors and to confound their 
arrogance, and presumptuous young men in order to teach 
them the truth of which they were ignorant; to question 
great and small, statesmen and masons, now Pericles and 
now a shopkeeper; to question always and everywhere in 
order to compel every one to form clear ideas; such was the 
constant occupation and passion of his life. When he 
allowed himself to dream of the future life, he said smilingly 
that he hoped to continue in the Elysian Fields the habits of 
the Athenian Agora, and still to interrogate the shades of 
the mighty dead. With Socrates, conversation became an 
art, and the dialogue a method. He scarcely ever employed 
the didactic form, or that of direct teaching. He addressed 
himself to his interlocutor, urged him to set forth his ideas, 
harassed him with questions often somewhat subtile, skil- 
fully led him to recognize the truth which he himself had in
-P-A-G-E-51
EDUCATION AMONG THE GREEKS. 23 
mind, or the rather permitted him to go off on a false route 
in order finally to discover to him his error and to sport with 
his confusion ; and all this with an art of wonderful analysis, 
with a subtilty of reasoning pushed almost to an extreme, 
and also with a great simplicity of language, and with 
examples borrowed from common life, such as we are accus- 
tomed to call intuitive examples. 
24. Tur Socratic Irony.—To form an intelligible ac- 
count of the Socratic method, it is necessary to distinguish 
its two essential phases. Socrates followed a double method 
and sought a double end. 
Tn the first case, he wished to make war against error and 
to refute false opinions. Then he resorted to what has been 
called the Socratic irony. He raised a question as one 
who simply desired to be instructed. If there was the 
statement of an error in the reply of the respondent, ‘Soera- 
tes made no objection to it, but pretended to espouse the 
ideas and sentiments of his interlocutor. Then, by questions 
which were adroit and sometimes insidious, he forced him to 
develop his opinions, and to display, so to speak, the whole 
extent of his folly, and the next instant slyly brought him 
face. to face with the consequences, which were so absurd and 
contradictory that he ended in losing confidence, in becoming 
involved in his conclusions, and finally in making confession 
of hig errors.

eratie:method,-that which he himself called mazeutics, or the 
art of “giving birth to ideas.

quence this‘ word: lost its primary meaning, and took the one which we 
sive it at this time.
-P-A-G-E-52
24. THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. © 
Socrates was convinced that the human mind in its normal 
condition discovers certain truths through its own energies, 
provided one knows how to lead it and stimulate it; and so 
he here appealed to the spontancity of his auditor, to his 
innate powers, and thus gently led him on his way by easy 
transitions to the opinion which he wished to make him 
admit. However, he applied this method only to the search 
for truths which could either be suggested by the intuitions 
of reason and common sense, or determined by a natural 
induction, that is, psychological, ethical, and religious truths.* 
26. Examptes or Irony anp Masevtics.— We can best 
give an exact idea of the Socratic method by means of ex- 
amples. These examples are to be found in the writings of 
the disciples of Socrates, as in the Dialogues of Plato, such 
asthe Gorgias, the Euthydemus, etc., and still better in the 
Memorabilia of Xenophon, where the thought of the master 
and his manner of teaching are more faithfully reproduced 
than in the bold and original compositions of Plato. While 
recognizing the insufficiency of these extracts, we shall here 
make two quotations, in which is displayed either his incisive; 
critical spirit, or his suggestive and fruitful method: ‘* The 
thirty tyrants had put many of the most distinguished citi. 
zens to death, and had encouraged others to acts of injustice. 
‘It would surprise me,’ said Socrates one day, ‘if the keeper 
of a flock, who had killed one part of it and had made the 
  
1 The Socratic method for the discovery of truth can be employed only 
in those cases where the pupil has the crude materials of the new knowl- 
edge actually in store. Psychology, logic, ethics, mathematics, and per- 
haps grammar and rhetoric, fall within the sphere of the Socratic method ; 
but to apply this method of instruction to geography, history, geology, and, 
in general, to subjects where the material is inaccessible, is palpably absurd. 
* The Socratic dialogue, in its negative phase, is aimed at presumption, arro. 
gance, and pretentious ignorance; but it is sometimes misused to badger 
and bewilder an honest and docile pupil. (P.)
-P-A-G-E-53

other part poor; would not confess that he was a bad herds: 
man ; but it would surprise me still more if a man standing 
at the head of his fellow-citizens should destroy a part of 
them and corrupt the rest, and were not to blush at his con- 
duct and confess himself a bad magistrate.’ This remark 
having come-to- the ears of the Thirty, Critias and Charicles 
sent for Socrates, showed him the law, and forbade him to 
hold conversation with the young. 
‘Socrates inquired of them if he might be permitted to ask 
questions touching what might seem obscure to him in this 
prohibition. Upon their granting this permission: ‘I am 
prepared,’ he said, ‘to obey the laws, but that I may not 
violate them through ignorance, I would have you clearly in-- 
form me whether you interdict the art of speaking because it 
belongs to the number of things which are good, or because 
it belongs to the number of things which are bad. In the 
first case, one ought henceforth to abstain from speaking 
what is good ; 3 in the second, it is clear that the effort should 
be to speak what is right.’ 
‘sThéreupon Charicles became angry, and said: ‘ Since 
you do not understand us, we will give you something easier 
to comprehend: we forbid you absolutely to hold conversa- 
tion with the young.’ ‘In order that it may be clearly seen,’ 
said Socrates, ‘ whether I depart from what is enjoined, tell 
me at what age a youth becomes a man.’ ‘At the time 
when he is ‘eligible to the senate, for he has not. acquired 
prudence till then ; so do not speak to young men who are 
below the age of thirty.’ 
‘+ Buot-if Iwish to buy something of a merchant who is 
below the'age of thirty, may I ask him at what price he sells

which are perfectly well known to you; it is this which is 
forbidden.’ 
*6¢So IT must not reply toa young man who asks me where 
Charicles ‘lives, or where Critias is.’ ‘You may reply to such 
questions,’ said Charicles. ‘ But recollect, Socrates,’ added 
Critias, ‘you must let alone the shoemakers, and smiths, and 
other artisans, for I think they must already be very much 
worn out vy being so often in your mouth.’ 
‘6<T must, therefore,’ said Socrates, ‘forego the illustra- 
tions I draw from these occupations relative to justice, piety, 
and all the virtues.’”? 
In the final passage of this cutting dialogue, observe the 
elevation of tone and the gravity of thought. So Socrates 
had marvellous skill in allying enthusiasm with irony. 
Here is an extract in which Socrates applies the maieutie 
art to the establishment of a moral truth, the belief in God: 
**J will mention a conversation he once had in my.pres- 
ence with Aristodemus, surnamed the Little, concerning the 
gods. He knew that Aristodemus neither sacrificed to the 
gods, nor consulted the oracles, but ridiculed those who took 
part in these religious observances. ‘Tell me, Aristodemus,’ 
_ Said he, ‘are there men whose talents you admire?’ ‘There 
are,’ he replied. ‘Then tell us their names,’ said Socrates. 
‘In epic poetry I especially admire Homer ; in dit 
Melanippides; in tragedy, Sophocles; in statua 
cletus ; in painting, Zeuxis.’ ‘But what artists do 
most worthy of admiration, those who form imager 
of sense and movement, or those who produce auuuaceu 
beings, endowed with the faculty of thinking and acting ? 
‘Those who form animated beings, for these are the . 
intelligence and not of chance.” ‘And which do yor 
  
1 Memorabilia, I. a.
-P-A-G-E-55
EDUCATION AMONG THE GREEKS. 27 
as the creation of intelligence, and which the product cf 
chance, those works whose purpose cannot be recognized, 
or those whose utility is manifest?’ ‘It is reasonable to 
attribute to an intelligence the works which have some useful 
purpose.’ ”* Socrates then points out to Aristodemus how admirably 
the different organs of the human body are adapted to the 
functions of life and to the use of man. And so proceeding 
from example to example, from induction to induetion, 
always keeping the mind of his auditor alert by the questions 
he raises, and the answers that he suggests, forcing him to 
do hjs share of the work, and giving him an equal share in 
the train of reasoning, he finally brings him to the goal 
which is to make him recognize the existence of God. 
27. Tax Rervsric or Prato.—‘‘ Would you form,” 
said J. J. Rousseau, “‘an idea of public education? read 
the Republic of Plato. It is the finest treatise on education 
ever written.” For truth’s sake we must discount the en- 
thusiasm of Rousseau. The Republic doubtless contains 
some élements of a wise and practical scheme of education ; 
bat, on the whole, it is but an ideal creation, a compound of 
paradoxes and chimeras. In Plato’s ideal commonwealth, the 
individual and the family itself are sacrificed to the State. 
‘Woiniin: becomes so much like man as to be subjected to 
the same gymnastic exercises ; she too must be a soldier as 
he ig;... Children know neither father nor mother. From the 
flay. oftheir birth they are given in charge of common nurses,

the reader for giving a complaisant welcome to his own 
dreams. 
28. Tux Epucation of Warriors AND MAGISTRATES. — 
Plato, by some unexplained recollection of the social con- 
stitution of the Hindoos, established three castes in his ideal 
State, — laborers and artisans, warriors, and magistrates. 
There was no education for laborers and artisans; it was 
sufficient for men of this caste to learn a trade. In politics, 
Plato is an aristocrat; he feels a disdain for the people, 
“¢ that robust and indocile animal.” It should be observed, 
however, that the barriers which he set up between these 
three social orders are not insuperable. If a child of the : 
inferior class gives, evidence of exceptional qualities, he must 
be admitted to the superior class; and so if the son of a 
warrior or of a magistrate is notably incompetent: and un- 
worthy of his rank, he must suffer forfeiture, and become 
artisan or laborer. 
. -- As to the education which he designs for the warriors and 
the magistrates, Plato is minutely careful in regulating it. 
The education of the warriors comprises two parts, — music 
and gymnastics. The education of the magistrates consists 
of a training in philosophy of a high grade; they are ini- 
tiated into all the sciences and into metaphysics. Plato’s 
statesmen must be, not priests, as in the East, but scholars 
and philosophers. 
29. Music anp Gymnastics. — Although Plato attaches 9 
high value to gymnastics, he gives precedence to music. 
Before forming the body, Plato, the idealist, would form 
“the soul, because it is the soul, according to him; which, by 
its own virtue, gives to the body all the perfection of which 
: it is capable. Even in physical exercises, the purpose should 
be to give increased vigor to the soul: ‘‘In the training of
-P-A-G-E-57
EDUCATION AMONG THE GREEKS. 20 
the body, our young men shall aim, above everything else, 
at augmenting moral power.” Note this striking picture of 
the man ‘who trains only his body: ‘‘ Let a man apply him- 
self to. gymnastics, and. become trained, and eat much, and 
wholly neglect music and philosophy, and at first his body 
will become strengthened; but if he does nothing else, and 
holds no converse with the Muses, though his soul have some 
natural inclination to learn, yet if it remains uncultivated 
by aequiring knowledge, by inquiry, by discourse, in a word, 
by some department of music, that is, by intellectual educa- 
tion, it will insensibly become weak, deaf, and blind. Like 
a wild beast, such a man will live in ignorance and rudeness, 
‘with neither grace nor politeness.” However, Plato is far 
from. despising health and physical strength. On the con- 
trary; it is a reproach to him that he has imposed on the 
citizens: of his Republic the obligation of being physically 
sound,-and of having excluded from it all those whose in- 
firmities'.and feeble. constitution condemn them to ‘drag

80. Reuieion anp Art ix Epucation.—Plato had 
formed a high ideal of the function of art in education, but 
this did not prevent him from being severe against certain 
forms of art, particularly comedy and tragedy, and poetry 
in general. He would have the poets expelled from the city 
‘ and conducted to the frontier, though paying them homage 
with perfumes which will continue to be shed upon their 
heads, and with flowers with which they will ever he crowned. 
He admits no other poetry than that which reproduces the 
manners and discourse of a good man, and celebrates the 
brave deeds of the gods, or chants their glory. As a severe 
moralist and worshipper of the divine goodness, he condemns 
the poets of his time, either because they attribute to the 
divinity the vices and passions of men, or because they invest 
the imagination with base fears as they speak of Cocytus 
and the Styx, and portray a frightful hell and gods always 
mad with desire to ‘persecute the human race. Elsewhere, 
in the Laws, Plato explains his conception of religion. He 
says that the religious books placed in the hands of children 
should be selected with as much care as the milk of a nurse. 
God is an infinite goodness who watches over men, and he 
should be honored, not by sacrifices and vain ceremonies, 
but by lives of justice and virtue. 
For making men moral, Plato counts more upon art than 
upon religious feeling. To love letters, to hold converse 
with the Muses, to cultivate music and dancing, such, in the 
opinion of the noble spirits of Athens, is the natural route 
towards moral perfection. In their-view, moral education 
is above all an education in art. The soul rises to the good 
through the beautiful. ‘* Beautiful and good” (Kadds Kai 
ya6és) are two words constantly associated in the speech of 
the Greeks. Even to-day we have much to learn from 
reflections like these: ‘‘ We ought,” says Plato, to seek

out artists who by the power of genius can trace out the 
nature of the fair and the graceful, that our young men, 
dwelling, as it were, in a healthful region, may drink in good 
from every quarter, whence any emanation from noble works 
may strike upon their eye or their ear, like a gale wafting 
health from salubrious lands, and win them imperceptibly 
from their earliest years into resemblance, love, and harmony 
with the true beauty. of reason. 
‘Ts it not, then, on these accounts that we attach such 
supreme importance to a musical education, because rhythm 
and harmony sink most deeply into the recesses of the soul, 
bringing gracefulness in their train, and making a man 
graceful if he be rightly nurtured; but if not, the reverse? 
and also because he that has been duly nurtured therein will 
have the keenest eye for defects, whether in the failures of 
art, or in the misgrowths of nature; and feeling a most just 
disdain for them, will commend beautiful objects, and gladly 
receive them into his soul, and feed upon them, and grow to be 
noble and good ; whereas he will rightly censure and hate all 
repulsive objects, even in his childhood, before he is able to 
be reasoned with; and when reason comes, he will welcome 
her most cordially who can recognize her by the instinct.

31. Hrewx Inrevcecruat Epvucation.—In the Republic 
of Plato the intellectual education of the warrior class 
remains. exclusively literary and msthetic. In addition to 
this, thé-education of the ruling class is to be scientific and 
philosoptiic. ‘The future magistrate, after having received 
the ordinary instruction up to the age of twenty, is to be 
initiated into the abstract sciences, mathematics, geometry,

doubtless through a contempt for tradition and the past. , 
32. _ Tue Laws. — In the Laws, the work of his old age, 
Plato disavows in part the chimeras of the Republic, and 
qualifies the radicalism of that earlier work. The philoso- 
pher descends to the earth and really condescends to the 
actual state of humanity, He renounces the distinction of 
social castes, and his very practical and very minute precepts 
are applied without distinction to children of all classes.1 
First note this excellent definition of the end of education: 
«¢ A good education is that which gives to the body and to 
the soul all the beauty and all the perfection of which they 
are capable,” As to methods, it seems that Plato hesitates 
between. the doctrine of effort and the doctrine of attractive 
toil. In fact, he says on the one hand that education is a 
very skilfal discipline which, by way of amusement,” leads the 
mind of the child to love that which is to make it finished. 
On the other hand, he protests against the weakness of those 
parents! ‘who’ feek to spare their children every trouble and 
every pain. “*T am persuaded,” he says, ‘* that the inclina- 
tion to ‘humor the likings of children is the surest of all ways 
to spoil-them. “We should not make too much haste in our 
search after what is pleasurable, especially as we shall never 
be wholly exempt from what is painful.” 
. Let us add this definition of a good education: ‘I call 
education the virtue which is shown by children when the 
feelings f joy or of sorrow, of love or of hate, which arise 
in theig.sonls, are made conformable to order.” ‘

-P-A-G-E-62
84 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
‘With the statement of these principles, Plato enters inte 
details. For children up to the age of six, he recommends 
the use of swaddling-clothes. The habit of rocking, the 
natural plays which children find out for themselves, the 
separation of the sexes ; swimming, the bow, and the javelin, 
for boys; wrestling for giving bodily vigor, and dancing, for 
graceful movement; reading and writing reserved till the 
tenth year and learned for three years. 
It would require too much time to follow the philosopher 
to the end. In the rules he proposes, he makes a near 
approach to the practices followed by the Athenians of his 
day. The. Republic was a work of pure imagination. The 
Laws are scarcely more than a commentary on the actual 
state of practice. But here we still find what was nearest 
the soul of Plato, the constant search for a higher morality. 
38. XEnoruon. — As an educator, Xenophon obeyed two 
different influences. His master, Socrates, was his good 
genius. That graceful and charming book, the Economics, 
was written under the benign and tempered inspiration of the 
great Athenian sage. But Xenophon also had his evil genius, 
'. the immoderate enthusiasm which he felt fo: 
her institutions and her laws. The first book of th: 
dia, which relates the rules of Persian education, is 
tunate imitation of the laws of Lycurgus. 
84. Tux Economics, anp THE Epucation or WoMAN. — 
All should read the Economics, that charming sketch of the 
. education of woman. We may say of this little work what 
Renan has said of the writings of Plutarch on the . 
ject: ‘* Where shall we find a more charming ides 
life? What good nature! What sweetness of 
‘What chaste and lovable simplicity!” Before he: 
the Athenian maiden has learned only to spin '

discreet, and to ask no questions, — virtues purely negative. 
Xenophon assigns to her husband the duty of training her 
mind and of.teaching her the positive duties of family life, — 
orders: economy, kindness to slaves, and tender care of 
children. As a matter of fact, the Athenian woman was 
still held in:a. position of inferiority. Shut up in her own 
apartmenis, it was an exception that she learned to read and 
-write ;.i6 was, very rare that she was instructed in the arts 
and sciences. The idea of human dignity and of the value 
of the human person had not yet appeared. Man had value 
only in proportion to the services which he could render the 
State;:or commonwealth, and woman formed no part. of the 
commonwealth. Xenophon has the merit of rising above 
the prejudices of his time, and of approaching the ideal of 
:the modern family, in calling woman to participate more inti- 
-mately:in thé: affairs of the house and in the occupations of 
.the husband. 
      Tar Crrormpia.—The Cyropedia is not worthy of 
commendation. Under the pretext of describing 
g: ation of the Persian State, Xenophon here traces, 
after h manner, the plan of an education absolutely uniform 
and exclusively military. There is no domestic education, 
no inditidual liberty, no interest in letters and arts. .When 
the period: of infancy is over, the young Persian is made 
-subjeet:to military duty, and must not leave the encamp- 
“ment: évén at night. The state is but a: camp, and human 
existed: perpetual military parade. Montaigné praises 
Xenophon: for - having said that the Persians taught their 
childvetp virtue.“ as other nations do letters.” But it is 
form an-estimate of the methods which were fol- 
‘these schools of justice and temperance, and we   
   
        jee particularly Chaps. vit. and vai,
-P-A-G-E-64
86 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
may be allowed to suspect the efficiency of the means pro 
posed by Xenophon; for example, that which consisted ia 
transforming the petty quarrels of the scholars into regular 
trials which were followed by sentences, acquittals, or convic- 
tions. The author of the Cyropedia is on surer ground 
when, recollecting his own studies, he recommends the study 
of history to those who would become just. He teaches 
temperance by practice rather than by precept; his pupils 
have only bread for their food, only cresses for seasoning, 
and only water for their drink. 
Whatever may be the faults and the fancies of the Cyro- 
peedia, we must recollect, as a partial excuse for them, that 
the purpose of the writer in tracing this picture of a simple, 
fragal, and courageous life, was to induce a reaction against 
the excesses of the fashionable and formal life of the 
Athenians. As Rousseau, in the middle of the eighteenth 
century, protested against the license and the artificial 
manners of his time by advising an imaginary return to 
aature, so Xenophon, a contemporary of the sophists, held 
‘forth the sturdy virtues of the Persians in opposition to the 
degenerate manners of the Greeks and the refinements of an 
advanced civilization. 
86. Aristorty: Genera CHARACTER OF HIS PLAN oF 
Epucatron. — By his vast attainments, by his encyclopzdic 
knowledge, by the experimental nature of his researches, and 
by the positive and practical tendencies of his genius, 
Aristotle was enabled to excel Plato in clearness of insight 
into pedagogical questions. He had another advantage over 
Plato in having known and enjoyed the delights of famiiy 
life, and in having loved and trained his own children, of 
whom he said, ‘‘ parents love their children as a part of 
themselves.” Let us add, finally, that he was a-practical 
teacher, since he was the preceptor of Alexander from 343

EDUCATION AMONG THE GREEKS. 87 
& $40-B.c: . Such opportunities, superadded to the force of 
the moyt mighty genius the world has ever seen, give promise 
of a céinpetent and clear-sighted educator. Unfortunately, 
we haye'lost the treatise, On Education (wepi radefas), which . 
on théeguthority of Diogenes Laertius, Aristotle is said to 
have. cémposed; and to form some conception of his ideas 
on edacation, we. have at our disposal only some imperfect 
sketches, some portions, and those in an imperfect state, 
of his.treatises on ethics and politics.! 
Whoever labors to give stability to the family, and to 
tighten its bond of union, labors also for the promotion of 
education. Even in this respect, education is under great 
obligations to Aristotle. In him the communism of Plato 
finds an able critic. That feeling of affection which we of 
to-day would call charity or fraternity, he declared to be the 
guaranty and the foundation of social life. Now, communism 
weakens this feeling by diluting it, just as a little honey 
dropped ‘into a large quantity of water thereby loses all its 
eweetness. “There are two things which materially con- 
tribute to the rise of interest and attachment in the hearts of

in the mame of good sense, and in opposition to the. dis- 
tempered fancies of Plato, that Aristotle vindicated the

in view in every city,” he says, ‘it is evident that education 
ought to be one and the same in all, and that this should be 
a common care, and not of each individual. ... Itis the 
duty of the legislator to regulate this interest for all the 
citizens.” There must, therefore, be the intervention of 
the State, not from the day of birth, as Plato would have it, 
for the nursing of infants, Dut only at the age of seven, for 
instructing and training them in the habits of virtue. 
What, then, should be the training of the child, and upon 
what subjects would Aristotle direct his studies? 
88. Tue Progressive Devetormenr or Human Nature. 
~— An essential and incontrovertible distinction is taken by 
the Greek philosopher as his starting-point. There are, he 
says, three moments, three stages, in human. development : 
first, there is the physical life of the body; then, instinct and 
sensibility, or the irrational part of the soul; and finally, the 
intelligence, or the reason. From this, Aristotl: 
that the course of discipline and study should b: 
according to these three degrees of life. ‘*Th. w... wus 
should necessarily be given to the body rather than 
mind; and then to that part of the spiritual nature \ 
the seat of the desires.’’? But he adds this importari 
vation, which is a refutation of Rousseau in advance: au uic 
‘care which we give to the sensibilities, we must not leave out 
of account the intelligence; and in our care of the body, we 
must not forget the soul.” , 
89. Puysican Epucation.—The son of a phys 
Macedonian court, and well versed in the natur: 
Aristotle is very happy in his treatment of phys 
tion. It begins before the child is born, even b 
been conceived. Consequently he enjoins a legal 
of marriages, interdicts unions that are too early

EDUCATION AMONG THE GREEKS, 33 
indicates the climatic conditions most favorable for marriage; 
and gives mothers wise counsels on matters of hygiene, rec- 
ommending them to nurse their own children, and prescrib- 
ing cold baths. Such, in outline, is a plan which s modern 
hygienist would not disavow. 
40. Inretcectuan anp Morat Epvucation. —It was the 
opinion of Aristotle that intellectual education should not 
begin before the age of five. . But, in accordance with the 
principle stated above, this period of waiting should not be 
the occasion of loss to the intelligence of the child; even his 
play should be a preparation for the work to which he will 
apply himself at a later period. On the other hand, Aristotle 
strongly insists on the necessity of shielding the child from 
all pernicious influences, such as those which come from 
association with slaves, or from immoral plays. 
In accord with all his contemporaries, Aristotle includes 
grammar, gymnastics, and music, among the elements of 
instruction. To these he adds drawing. But he is chiefly 
preoccupied -with music, by reason of the moral influence 
which he attributes to it. He shared the prepossession 
which caused the Greeks to say, that to relax or to reform 
the maiiners of a people, it suffices to add a string to the 
lyre or to take one from it. 1 
Aristotle 1 was strongly preoccupied with moral education. 
Like ‘Plato, he insists on the greatest care in forming the 
moral habits of early life. In his different writings on ethics 
he has discussed different human virtues in a spirit at once 
wise, practical, and liberal. No one has better sung the

the Greeks:ascribed to music, unless we conceive that the Greek was en- 
dowed-with peculiar and extreme sensitiveness. Perhaps there is special 
significance in the story of Orpheus and his lyre. (P.) \

praises of justice, of which he says, ‘‘ Neither the evening 
nor the morning star inspires as much respect as justice.”” 
It would do Aristotle injustice to seek for a complete 
expression of his thoughts on education in the incomplete 
and ‘curtailed statements of theory which are found in his 
Politics. Yn connection with these, we should recall the ad- 
mirable instruction which he himself gave in the Lyceum, and 
which embraced almost all the sciences in its vast programme. 
He excluded from it only the sciences and the arts which 
have a mechanical and utilitarian character. Enslaved on 
this point to the prejudices of antiquity, he regarded as 
servile and unworthy of a free man whatever has a direct 
bearing on the practical and material utilities of life. He 
recommended to his hearers only studies of the intellectual 
type, those whose sole purpose is to elevate the mind and to 
fill it with noble thoughts.’ 
41. Favrrs is Tue Pepacocy or ARISTOTLE, AND IN 
Greek Pepacoey my GENERAL. — It must be said in con- 
clusion, that whatever admiration we may feel for the peda- 
gogy of Aristotle, it was wrong, like that of all the Greek 
writers, in being but an aristocratic system of education. 
The education of which Plato and Aristotle dreamed’ was 
restricted to a small minority, and was even made possible 
only because the majority was excluded from it. The 
slaves, charged with the duty of providing for the suste- 
nance of their superiors, and of creating for them the leisure 
claimed by Aristotle, had no more participation in education 
than in liberty or in property. In the century of Pericles, 
1] think it may be doubted whether the disfavor shown by Plato and 
Aristotle to practical studies was merely a mean prejudice. Preoccunied 
as they were with the disciplinary value of studies, they n) 
that the culture aim and the utilitarian aim are in some sor’

EDUCATION AMONG THE GREEKS. 41 
at the most glorious period of the Athenian republic, let us 
not forget that there were at Athens nearly four hundred. 
thousand slaves to do the bidding of twenty thousand free 
citizens. To indulge in an easy admiration for Greek peda- 
gogy, we must detach it from its setting, and consider it in 
itself, apart from the narrow plan on which the Greek states 
were constructed, and apart from that social régime which 
assured the education of some, only by perpetuating the 
oppression of the many. . 
(42. Anaryticat Summary.—1. A leading conception in 
Greek education is that of symmetry, or harmony 3 the ideal 
man, in Plato’s phrase, must be ‘‘ harmoniously constituted” ; 
all opposing tendencies must be reconciled; and while the 
. Physical, the intellectual, and the moral must each be made 
the subject of systematic training, there must be no dispro- 
portionate development i in either direction. 
2. The preoceupation of the Greek teacher was discipline 
or cultyre, rather. than the communication of useful knowl- 
eee 3)and the final aim was a life of contemplation, rather 
alife of action; ethical rather than practical; ‘good 
conduct ” rather than mastery over what is material. 
&. Physical training received great. emphasis, not as an 
end in, itself, but as a means towards mental and spiritual 
health ;, and knowledge was valued chiefly as the means for 
attaining moral excellence. 
4, The staple of instruction was wisdom, ¢.e., ethical and 
prudential knowledge, which was the basis of right action ; 
and teaching, especially according to the Socratic conception 
of it, consisted in causing the pupil’s mind to react on the 
materials supplied by his own mind) Socrates, says Lewes, 
“believed that in each man lay the germs of wisdom. He 
believed that no science could be taught; only drawn out.”
-P-A-G-E-70
42 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
5, The great teaching intrument was dialectic, i.e., dis- 
cussion, resolution, or analysis. Its use assumed that the 
subject-matter of instruction was already in the pupil’s pos- 
session, and that the highest office of the teacher was to 
liberate the thought which had been formed by the active 
energies of the pupil’s own mind. This is the maieutic art 
of Socrates. 
6. The mode of mental activity which was chiefly brought - 
into requisition was the reason; in a secondary degree the 
imagination and the emotions; and in a still lower degree, 
the memory. 
7, The large place assigned to music by Plato and Aris-— 
totle shows that the culture of the emotions was an impor- 
tant element in Greek education. Msthetic training was 
not only an end in itself, but was regarded as the basis of 
moral and religious culture. 
8, In the writings of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, we 
see the first attempt to formulate a body of educational 
doctrine ; we have the germs of a science of education based 
on psychology, ethics, and politics. 
9. In the Republic, we see the theory of compulsion in 
both its phases: the State must provide an education suita- 
ble for State needs; and the young must accept this educa- 
tion because the State has ordained it. For the first time in 
the history of ‘thought, the State appears distinctly and 
avowedly as an. educator. 
10, Practically, education was administered on the basis 
of caste ; though in the construction of his ideal State, Plato 
made it possible for talent, industry, and worth, to find their 
proper level.]

43, Iwo Pertops 1x Roman Epucation. —In Greece, as 
we have seen, there were two essentially different systems of 
education.in use: at Sparta, a one-sided education, wholly 
military, with no regard for intellectual culture ; at Athens, 
a complete education, which brought into happy harmony 
the training ofthe body and the development of: the mind, 
and by means of which, as Thucydides observed, ‘‘ men 
philosophized without becoming effemina: 
Rome, in the long course of her history, followed these 
two systems in succession. Under the Republic, down to 
the conquest. of Greece, preference was given to education 
after the Spartan type; while under the emperors, Athenian 
education was dominant, with a very marked tendency to 
give the. first. place to an education in literature and oratory.
-P-A-G-E-72
44 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
44, Tae Epvcation or THE Earty Romans. — The first 
schools were not opened at Rome till towards the end of the 
third century .c. Till then, the Romans had no teachers 
save their parents and nature. Education was almost exclu- 
sively physical ind moral, or rather, military and religious. 
On the one hand, there were the gymnastic exercises on the 
Campus Martius, and on the other, the recitation of the 
Salian hymns, a sort of catechism containing the names of 
the gods and goddesses. Besides this, there was the study 
of the Twelve Tables, that is, of the Roman Law. Men the 
' most robust, the most courageous, the best disciplined, and 
the most patriotic that ever lived, were the fruit of this 
natural education. Rome was the great school of the civic and 
military virtues. The Romans did not imitate the Athenians 
in a disinterested pursuit of a perfect physical and intellectual 
development. (Rome worked for practical ends; she was 
guided only by considerations of utility ; she had no regard 
for ideals ; her purpose was simply the education of soldiers 
and citizens who should be obedient and devoted. She did 
not know man in the abstract; she knew only the Roman 
citizen, 
These high qualities of the early Romans were | 
a sort of brutal insensibility and a contempt for 
of intellect and heart; and leaving out of accow 
cumstances of environment and race, their practi: 
may be aseribed to three or four principal caus. 
among these was a firm family discipline. The 
of the father was absolute, and answering to this cavuooivs 
power, there was blind obedience. Another cause was the 
position of the mother in the family. At Rome, wor 
held in higher esteem than at Athens. She became 
the equal of man. She was the guardian of the fami 
and the teacher of her children. The very name

inspires respect. Coriolanus, who took up arms against his 
country, could not withstand the tears of his mother Veturia. 
The noble Cornelia was the teacher of her sons, the Gracchi, 
whom she was accustomed to call ‘‘her fairest jewels.” 
Besides, the influence of religion was made“to supplement 
the active efforts of the family. The Roman:iived sur- 
rounded by deities. When a child was weaned, tradition 
would have it that one goddess taught him to eat, and another 
to drink. Later on, four goddesses guided his first steps and 
held his two hands. All these superstitions imposed regu- 
larity and exactness on the most ordinary acts of daily 
life. Men breathed, as it were, a divine atmosphere. 
Finally, the young Roman learned to read in the laws of the 
Twelve Tables, that is, in the civil code of his country. He 
wag thus accustomed from infancy to consider the law as 
something natural, inviolable, and sacred. 
45. Rome at Scooot mv Greece. — The primitive state of 
manners did not last. Under Greek influence, Roman sim- 
plicity suffered a change, and, as Horace says, Greece, in 
being conquered, conquered in turn her rude victor. The 
taste for letters and arts was introduced at Rome towards 
the close of the third century z.c., and transformed the 
austere and rade education of the primitive era. The 
Romans, in their turn, acquired a liking for fine phrases and 
subtile dialectics. Schools were opened, and the rhetoricians 
and philosophers took up the business of education. Parents 
no longer charged themselves with the instruction of their 
children. Following the fashion at Athens, they entrusted 
them to slayes, without troubling themselves about the faults 
or even the vices of these common pedagogues. 
“ For if any of their servants,” says Plutarch, ‘* be better 
than the rest, they dispose some of them to follow husbandry, 
some to navigation, some to merchandise, some to be stew

ards in their houses, and some, lastly, to put out their mone 
to use for them. But if they find any slave that is a drunk; 
ard or a glutton, and unfit for any other business, to bi 
they assign the government of their children; whereas,

speculative inquiry. [They reached distinction only i |

science, nevertheless reposes upon philosophical principles. 
upon a knowledge of human nature, and upon a theoretical 
conception of human destiny, — questions which had no liv- 
ing interest for the Roman mind, and which even Cicero has 
noticed only in passing, in the course of his translation of 
Plato, made with his usual magnificence of literary style.

And he does not seem to disapprove of this neglect, even 
while noting the fact that Polybius saw in this an important 
defect in. Roman institutions. 
47, Cicero. —In all Cicero’s works we find scarcely a 
line relative to education. And yet the great orator ex- 
claims: ‘‘ What better,.what greater service can we of to-day 
render the Republic than to instruct and train the young?”? 
But he was content with writing fine discourses on philoso- 
phy for his country, abounding more in eloquence than in 
originality. 
48. Varro.— A less celebrated writer, Varro, seems to 
have had some pedagogic instinct. He wrote real educa- 
tional works on grammar, rhetoric, history, and geometry. 
Most of these have been lost; butif we may trust his contem- 
poraries, they were instrumental in the education of several 
generations. 
49. Quinrinran (35-95 a.p.).— After the age of Augus- 
tus,.education became more and more an affair of oratory. 
The chief effort in the way of education was a preparation 
for a éareer in the Forum. But from these vulgar rhetori- - 
cians, occupied with the exterior artifices of style, these 
‘“ traffickers in words,” as Saint Augustine called them, we 
must distinguish a rhetorician of a higher order, who does 
not separate rhetoric from a general culture of the intelligence. 
This is Quintilian, the author of the Institutes of Oratory. 
Appointed at the. age of twenty-six to a chair of eloquence, 
the first that was established by the Roman state, and called 
at a later period by the Emperor Domitian to direct the 
education of his grand-nephews, Quintilian was practically 
acquainted with both public and private instruction.

vt} THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
50. Tre Insrrrvres or Oratory. — This work, under the 
form of a treatise on rhetoric, is in parts a real treatise on 
education. The author, in fact, begins the training of the 
future orator from the cradle; he gives counsel to its nurse, 
and ‘not blushing to descend to petty details,” he follows 
step by step the education of his pupil. Let us add, that in 
the noble ideal which he conceives, eloquence never being 
considered apart from wisdom, Quintilian was led by his 
very subject to treat of moral education. : 
51. His Generan Pian or Epucation. ~The first book 
entire is devoted to education in general, and its teachings 
might be applied indifferently to all children, whether des- 
tined or not to the practice of oratory. 
‘* Has a son been born to you? From the first conceive 
the highest hopes of him.” Thus Quintilian begins. He 
thinks that we cannot have too high an opinion of human 
nature, nor propose for it too high a purpose. Minds that 
rebel against all instruction are unnatural. Most often it is 
the training which is at fault; it is not nature that is to 
blame. ~ 
52. Tus Earty Epvcation or THE Crip. — The child’s 
nurses should be virtuous-and prudent. Quintilian does not 
demand that they shall be learned, as the stoic Chrysippus 
would have them; but he requires that their language shall 
be.irreproachable. The first impressions of the child are very 
durable: ‘‘ New vases preserve the taste of the first liquor 
that is put into them; and wool, once colored, never regains 
its primitive whiteness.” 
By an illusion analogous to that of the literary men of the 
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, who would have the little 
French boy first learn Latin, Quintilian teaches his pupil 
Greek before making him study his native tongue.
-P-A-G-E-77
EDUCATION AT ROME, “ 
Studies, moreover, should begin betimes: ‘“‘ Turn to av- 
count the child’s first years, especially as the elements of 
Jearning demand only memory, and the memory of children 
is very ténacious.” 
We seem to be listening to a modern teacher when Quin- 
tilian recommends the avoidance of whatever might ruffle the 
spirits of the child. ‘+ Let study be to him a play; ask him 
questions ; commend him when he does well; and sometimes 
let him enjoy the consciousness of his little gains in wisdom.” 
53. Reaping anp Writinc.—The passage relative to 
reading deserves to be quoted in full. It is wrong, says 
Quintilian, to teach children the names of the letters, and 
their respective places in the alphabet, before they know their 
shapes. He recommends the use of letters in ivory, which 
children take pleasure in handling, seeing, and naming. 
As to writing, Quintilian recommends, for the purpose of 
strengthening the child’s hand, and of preventing it from 
making false movements, that he should practise on wooden 
tabléts ‘on which the letters have been traced by cutting.!. 
Later on, the copies shall contain, ‘ not senseless maxims, 
but ioral traths.” The Roman teacher did not counsel 
haste in any case. ‘¢ We can scarcely believe,” he says, 
‘how progress ‘in reading is retarded by attempting to go 
too fast.” 
54. Ppsrid Epucazion. —Quintilian has made an unsur- 
passed plea for public education and its advantages, which

Rollin has reproduced almost entire! From this we shall 
quote only the following. passage, which proves how far the 
contemporaries of Quintilian had already departed from the 
manly habits of the early ages ; and the truth which is herein 
-expressed will always be applicable to parents who are in- 
clined to be over-indulgent: ‘¢ Would that we ourselves did 
not corrupt the morals of our children! We enervate their 
very infancy with luxuries. That delicacy of education, 
‘which we call fondness, weakens all the powers, both of 
body and mind.... We form the palate of our children be- 
fore we form their pronunciation. They grow up in sedan 
chairs ; if they touch the ground, they hang by th ~ 
attendants supporting them on each side. We ar: 
if they utter anything immodest. Expressions w! 
not be tolerated even from effeminate youths, we uca scum 
them with a smile and a kiss. Need we be astonished at this 
behavior? We ourselves have taught them.” ? , 
.55.. Dourmes or Tracuers.— There was at Ro: 
- first century of the Christian era, a high concep": 
duties of a teacher: ‘His first care should be t: 
. with all possible thoroughness the mind and the Clhauevuws vx 
.the child.” Judicious reflections on the memory, on the 
:faculty of imitation, and on the dangers of prec: 
development, are proofs of the fine psychologica : 
of Quintilian. His insight is no less accuraw wueu us 
sketches the rules for moral discipline. ‘ Fear,” he says, 
‘“‘restrains some and unmans others.... For . 
prefer a pupil who is sensitive to praise, whom glor. 
and from whom defeat draws tears.”

- Quintilian expresses himself decidedly against the use. of 
the rod, ‘although custom authorizes it,” he says, ‘and 
Chrysippus does not disapprove of it.” 
56. Grammar anp Rueroric. — Like his contemporaries, 
Quintilian distinguishes studies into two grades, — Grammar 
and Rhetoric, ‘‘ As soon as the child is able to read and 
write, he must be placed in the hands of the grammarian.” 
Grammar was divided into two parts, — the art of speaking 
correctly and the explication of the poets. Exercises’ in 
composition, development lessons called Chriw, and narra- 
tives, accompanied the theoretical study of the rules of: 
grammar.’ It is to be observed that Quintilian gives a high 
place to etymological studies, and that he attaches great im- 
portance to'reading aloud. ‘‘ That the child may read well, 
let him have a good understanding of what 'he reads. . : . 
When he reads the poets, let him shun affected ‘modulations. 
It is with reference to this manner of reading ‘that Cesar, 
still'a young man, made this excellent observation: ‘If you 
are singing, you sing poorly ; if you are reading, why do you sing?” : 
57. Tue Smmvuraxrous Srupy or tHe Scrences. — Quin. 
tilian is very far from confining his pupil within the narrow 
circle of grammatical study. Persuaded that the child is 
capable of learning several things at the same time, he would 
have hint taught geometry, music, and philosophy simulta~ 
neously :— : 
‘* Must he learn grammar alone, and then geometry, and 
in the meanwhile forget-what le first learned? As well ad-

thought simultaneously to his meadows, his cattle, * : 
dens, and his bees.” ! : 
Of course Quintilian considers the different studic 
he sets before his pupil only as the instruments for an cuuva 
tion in oratory. Philosophy, which comprises dialectics of 
logic, physics or the science of nature, and lastly moral 
furnish the orator with ideas, and teach him the art of dis 
tributing them into a consecutive line of argument. And s

Seneca attempts to direct school instruction to practical ends, 
in following out the thought of this famous precept: ‘* We 
should learn, not for the sake of the school, but for the pur- 
poses of life” (Won schole, sed vite discimus).’ Moreover, 
he criticises confused and ill-directed reading that does not 
enrich the understanding, and concludes by recommending 
the profound study of a single book (timeo hominem unius 
libri). In another letter he remarks that the best means for 
giving clearness to one’s own ideas is to communicate them 
to others ; the best way of being taught is to teach (docendo 
discimus). ‘Let us quote this other maxim so often repeated: 
“The end is attained sooner by example than by precept ” 
(longum iter per proecepta, breve per exempla). 
60. Prorarch (50-138 a.p.).—In the last period of Roman 
civilization two names deserve to arrest the attention of the 
educator, —~ Plutarch and Marcus Aurelius. Although he 
was born in Beotia, and wrote in Greek, Plutarch - belongs 
to the Roman world. He lived at Rome at several different 
times,‘and there opened a school in the reign of Domitian, 
where he. lectured on philosopby, literature, and history. 
Numerous works have transmitted to us the substance of that 
instruction which had such an extraordinary success. 
61, Tre Lives or Intustrious Mrn. — Translated in the 
fifteenth ‘century by Amyot, the Parallel Lives of. Plutarch 
were for our fathers a true code of morals founded on his- 
tory.. How many of our great men,.or how many of our 
men of worth, have drawn from this book, at least in part, 
the material which has nurtured their virtues! L’Hopital 
and d’Aubigné enriched their lives from this source. Henry 
IV. said.of this book: ‘‘ It has been to me as my conscience, 
and has whispered in my ear many virtuous suggestions and

excellent maxims for my own conduct and for the manage- 
ment of my affairs.” + 
62. Tue Essay on Tax Trarinine or Cuitpren. — The 
celebrated essay entitled Of the Training of Children,’ is the 
first treatise, especially devoted to education, that antiquity 
has bequeathed to us. Its authenticity has been called in| 
question by German critics ; but this is of little moment, since 
these.critics are the first to recognize the fact that the author| 
of this essay, whoever he might have been, was intimately 
acquainted with Plutarch, and has given us a sufficiently 
exact summary of the ideas which are more fully developed 
in others of his, works.> 
We shall not give an analysis of this work, which, how- 
ever, abounds in interesting reflections on the.prim 7 
of education. We shall simply note the fundamen! 
of the essay, its salient and original characteristi: 
its warm appreciation of the family. In society, « 
conceives it, the State no longer exercises absoluw wuvcs- 
eignty. Upon the ruins of the antique commonwe: 
Plutarch builds the family. It is to the family that. 
addresses himself in order to assure the education ur 
children.* On this point he is not in accord with Quintilian. 
  
. 1 Equally great has been Plutarch’s influence on English thought and 
life. Sir Thomas North’s translation of Amyot’s version appeared in 1579, 
and furnished Shakespeare with the materials for his Coriola 
Cxsar,and Antony and Cleopatra. Milton, Wordsworth, anc 
are also debtors to the Parallel Lives. (P.)

What. he.recommends is an education that is domestic and 
individual... He scarcely admits the need of public schools 
save for the higher instruction. At.a certain age a young 
man, already trained by the watchful care of a preceptor 
under the supervision of his parents, shall go abroad to hear 
the lectures. of the moralists and the philosophers, and to read 
the poets. / : 
63. Tae Epvucation or Women. — One of ‘the conse- 
quences of the exalted function which Plutarch ascribes to 
the family is that by this single act he raises the material and 
moral condition of woman. In his essay entitled Conjugal 
Precepts, which recalls the Economics of. Xenophon, he 
restores to the wife her place in the household. He asso- 
ciates her with the. husband in the material: support of the 
family, as well as in the education of the children. The 
mother is to.nurse her offspring. ‘‘ Providence,” he naively 
says, ‘‘ hath also wisely ordered that women should have two 
breasts, that so, if any of them should happen to bear twins, 
they thight have two several springs of nourishment ready for 
them.”’? The mother shall also take part in the instruction 
of her children, and so she must herself be educated: Pln- 
  half of free-born children in good circumstances. “He abandons,” as he 
himself admits, ‘‘the education of the poor and the lowly.” 
Plotarch seems to aim at what appears to him to be practicable. That 
he was liberal in his opinions must be evident, I think, from this extract : 
“Tt is‘my‘desire that all children whatsoever may partake. of the benefits 
of education alike ; but if yet any persons, by reason of the narrowness of 
their estates, cannot make use of my precepts, let them not blame me that 
give them, but Fortune, which disableth them from making the advantage 
by them they ctherwise might. Though even poor men must use their 
utmost endeavor to give their children the best education 3 or, if they can 
not, they must: bestow upon them the best that their abilities will reach.”! (Morais, vol. L. pp. 19, 20.) (P.) 1 Of the Training of Children, § 6,   
 
-P-A-G-E-84
66 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
tarch proposes for her the highest studies, such as mathe- 
matics and philosophy. But he counts much more upon her 
natural qualities, than upon the science that she may 
acquire. ‘* With women,” he says, ‘‘ tenderness of heart is 
enhanced by a pleasing countenance, by sweetness of speech, 
by an affectionate grace, and by a high degree of sensitive- 
ness.” 
64. Tur Foxcrion or Porrry ix Epucation.—In the 
essay entitled How a Young Man Ought to Hear Poems, 
Plutarch has given his opinion as to the extent to which 
poetry shoufd be made an element in education. More just 
than Plato, he does not condemn the reading of the poets. 
He simply demands that this reading should be done with 
' discretion, by choosing those who, in their compositions, 
mingle moral inspiration with poetic inspiration. ‘‘Lycur- 
gus,” he says, ‘‘ did not act like a man of sound reason in 
the course which he took to reform his people that were 
much inclined to drunkenness, by traveling up and down to 
destroy all the vines in the country; whereas he should have 
ordered that every vine should have a well of water near it, 
that (as Plato saith) the drunken deity might be reduced to 
temperance by a sober one.””* 
65. Tae TracHine or Moras. — Plutarch is above all 
else a moralist. If he adds nothing in the way of theory to 
the lofty doctrines of the Greek philosophers from whom he 
eatches his inspiration, at least he enters more profoundly 
into the study of practical methods which ipsure the efficacy 
of fine precepts and exalted doctrines. (‘That contempla- 
tion which is dissociated from practice,” he says, “is of no 
utility.”)_ He would have young men come from lectures on 
  
1 Morals, vol. Ul. p. 44,
-P-A-G-E-85
EDUCATION AT ROME. — 81 
morals, not only better instructed, but more virtuous. Of 
what consequence are beautiful maxims unless they are 
embodied in: action? The young man, then, shall early 
accustom himself to self-government, to reflection upon his 
own conduct, and to taking counsel of his own reason. 
Moreover, Plutarch gives him a director of conscience, a 
philosopher, whom he will go to consult in his doubts, and 
to whom he will entrust the keeping of his soul. But that 
which is of most consequence in his eyes is personal effort, 
reflection always on the alert, and that inward effort which 
causes our soul to assimilate the moral lessons which we have 
received, and which causes them to enter into the very struc- 
ture and fibre of our personality. 
“ As it would be with a man who, going to his neighbor’s 
to borrow fire, and finding there a great and bright fire, 
should sit down to warm himself and forget to go home; so 
is it with the one who comes to another to learn, if he does 
not think himself obliged to kindle his own fire within, and 
influence his own mind, but continues sitting by his master 
as if he were enchanted, delighted by hearing.” ! 
So ‘are those who are not striving to have a personal 
morality, but who, incapable of self-direction, are always in 
need of the tutorship of another. 
The great preoccupation of Plutarch — and by this trait he 
has a legitimate place among the great educators of the 
world — was to awaken, to excite, the interior forces of the 
consdience, and to stimulate the intelligence to a high state 
of activity. When he wrote this famous maxim, ‘‘ The soul 
is not. vase to be filled, but is rather a hearth which is to be

made to glow,”? he was not thinking alone of moral educa 
tion, but also of a false intellectual education which, instead 
of training the mind, is content with accumulating in the 
memory a mass of indigested materials.? 
"66. ‘Marcus Aurerivs. —The wisest of the Roman em- 
perors, the author of the book entitled To Myself, better 
known as Meditations, Marcus Aurelius deserves mention 
in the history of, pedagogy. He is perhaps the most perfect 
representative of Stoic morality, which is itself the highest 
expression of ancient morality. He is the most finished type. 
of what can be effectéd in the way of soul-culture by the in- 
fluence of home-training and the personal effort of the con- 
science. His teacher of rhetoric was the celebrated Fronto, 
of whose character we may judge from this one characteristic : 
‘+T toiled hard yesterday,” he wrote to his pupil; ‘‘ I composed 
a few figures of speech, with which I am pleased.” On the 
other hand, Marcus Aurelius found examples for imitation in 
his own fatnily. ‘* My uncle,” he says reverently, ‘* taught 
me patience.... From my father I inherited modesty. . 
Tomy mother I owe my feelings of piety.” Notwithstanding 
the modesty that led him to attribute to others the whole of 
his moral worth, it is especially to himself, to a persistent 
effort of his own will, and to a ceaseless examination of his . 
own conscience, that he i is indebted for becoming the most 
virtuous of men, and the wisest and purest, next to Socrates, 
of the inoralists of antiquity. His Meditations show us in, 
1 The exact reading is as follows: ‘For the mind requires not like an 
earthen vessel to be filled up ; convenient fuel and aliment only will influ- 
ence it with a desire of knowledge and ardent love of truth.” (Morals, L 
p.463.) This makes the author’s meaning more apparent. (P.) 
2 This-does not mean that Plutarch sets a low value on memory, for he 
says: “ Above all things, we must exercise the memory of children, for it 
is the treasury of knowledge.”

action that self-education which in our time has suggested 
such beautiful reflections to Channing. 
67.- Concruston.— Finally, it must be admitted that 
Roman literature is poor in material for educational study. 
Some passages, scattered here and there in the classical 
authors, nevertheless prove that they were not absolutely 
strangers to pedagogical questions. 
Thus Horace professed independence of mind ; he declares 
that he is not obliged to swear by the ‘‘ words of any mas- 
ter.”* On the other hand, Juvenal defined the ideal purpose 
of life and of education when he said that the desirable thing 
above all others is “‘a sound mind in a sound body.”? 
Finally,, Pliny the Younger, in three words, mulium, non 
multa, ‘much, not many things,” fixes one essential point in 
educitional- method, and recommends the thorough study of 
one single subject in preference to a superficial | study which 
extends over too many subjects. 
While by: their taste, their accuracy of thought, and the 
perfection of their style, the Latin writers are worthy of 
being placed by the side of the Greeks as proficients in edu- 
eation of the literary type, they at the same time deserve to 
be regarded as reputable guides in moral education. At 
Rome, as at Athens, that which formed the basis of instruc- 
tion was the search after virtue. That which preoccupied 
Cicero as well as Plato, Seneca as well as Aristotle, was not 
so much the extension of knowledge and the development of 
instruction as the progress of manners and the moral per- 
fection of man.

60 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
" discipline or culture, Roman education may be called prac. 
tical. Greece and Rome have thus furnished the world with 
two distinct types of education, and their modern representa- 
tives are seen in our classical and scientific courses respec- 
tively. . 
2. The disinclination of the Roman mind to ‘speculative 
inquiry, was a bar to the production of any contributions to 
the theory of education. 
3. In the Institutes of Quintilian we see the first attempt to 
expound the art of teaching; and in the Morals of Plutarch 
we have the first formal treatise on the education of children. 
4. In the later period of Roman education, we see a higher 
appreciation of woman, and a nobler conception of the 
family life. 
5. In common with all the systems of education thus far 
studied, Roman education is essentially literary, ethical, and 
prudential, as distinguished from an education in science. 
The conception of the money value of knowledge had not yet 
appeared. ]

69.. Tae New Sprerr or CurisTianrry. — By its dogmas, 
by the conception of the equality of all human creatures, by 
its spirit of charity, Christianity introduced new elements 
into the conscience, and seemed called to give a powerful 
impetus to thé moral education of men} The doctrine of 
Christ was at first a reaction of free will and of personal 
dignity against the despotism of the State. ‘‘A full half of 
man henceforth escaped the action of the State. {Cian 
ity taught that man no longer belonged to society except in 
part; that he was under allegiance to it by his body and his 
material interests; that being subject to a tyrant, he must 
submit; that ag‘a citizen of a republic, he ought to give his 
life for it; but that in respect of his soul, he was free, and 
owed allegiance only to God.’)! Henceforth it was not sim- 
ply a question of training citizens for the service of the State ;

tained in germ in the doctrine of Christianity. 
70. Poverty or THe Frest CuristiAN CENTURIES IN 
sPECT OF Epucation. — Nevertheless, the germs contasuer 
in the doctrines of the new religion did not bear fruit. a 
once. . It is easy to analyze the causes which led to the pov. 
erty of educational thought during the first centuries of the 
Christian era. : 
In the first place, the Christian instruction was addy 
to barbarous peoples who could not at once rise to 4. 
intellectual and moral culture. According to the celeb. _.._. 
comparison of Jouffroy, the invasion of the barbarians int« 
the midst of ancient society was like an armful of greer 
wood thrown upon a blazing fire; at first there could issu 
from it only a mass of smoke. 
Moreover,.we must take into. eccount the fact that ! 
early Christians, in order to establish their faith, had 
struggle against difficulties which were ever bein; ~ 
The first centuries were a period of struggle, of 
and of organization, which left but little opportu: 
disinterested study of education. In their contesw wien tun 
ancient world, the early Christians came to include in 
mon hatred. classical literature and pagan religion. 
they receive with sympathy the literary and scientific 
tance of. a society whose morals they repudiated, an: 
beliefs they were bent on destroying?

’ On the other hand, the social condition of the men who 
first attached themselves to the new religion turned them 
aside from the studies which are a preparation for real life. 
Obliged to conceal themselves, to betake themselves to the 
desert, true Pariahs of the pagan world, they lived a life of 
contemplation; they were naturally led to conceive an as- 
cetic and monastic existence as the ideal of education. 
Moreover, by its mystical tendencies, Christianity atthe 
first could not be a good school for a practical and humane 
system of education. The Christian was detached from the 
commonwealth of man, only to enter into the commonwealth 
of God. He must break with a corrupt and perverse world. 
By privations, and by the renunciation of every pleasure, he 
must react against the immorality of Graeco-Roman society. 
Man must aspire to imitate God; and God is absolute holi-+ 
ness, the very négation of all the conditions of earthly life,— 
supreme perfection. The very disproportion between such an 
ideal anc’ human weakness as an actual fact must have be- 
trayed the early Christians into leading a mystical life which 
was but a preparation for death. And the consequence of 
these doctrines was to make of the Church the exclusive 
mistress of education and instruction. Individual initiative, 
if called into play, on the one hand, by the fundamental doc- 
trines of Christianity, was stifled, on the other, under the 
domination of the Church. 
71. Tue Farners or me Cuurcu. — Of the celebrated 
doctors who, by their erudition and eloquence, if not by 
their taste, made illustrious the beginning: of Christianity, 
some were jealous mystics and sectaries, in whose eyes phil- 
osophical curiosity was a sin, and the love of letters a heresy ; 
and others were Christians of a conciliatory temperament, 
who, in @ certain measure, allied religious faith and literary 
culture. :
-P-A-G-E-92
64 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
Tertullian rejected all pagan education. He saw in classi 
eal culture only a robbery from God; a road to the false an 
arrogant wisdom of the ancient philosophers. Even Sain 
Augustine, who in his youth could not read the four 
of the Eneid without shedding tears, and who had bec 
tedly fond of ancient poetry and eloquence, renounce 
his conversion, his literary tastes as well as the mad passiou 
of his early manhood. It was by his influence that the 
Council of Carthage forbade the bishops to read the pag: 
authors. 
This was not the course of Saint Basil, who demands, on 
the contrary, thatthe young Christian shall be conversant 
with the orators, poets, and historians of antiquity; who 
thinks that the poems of Homer inspire a love for vin 
and who desires, finally, that full use should be made of 
treasures of ancient wisdom in the training of the youny.- 
Nor was this the thought of Saint Jerome, who said he 
would be none the less a Ciceronian in becoming a Christian.

from them every day. It is impossible, to-day, while 
ing certain parts of them, not to condemn the gener: 
which pervades them, —a narrow spirit, distrustful 
world, which pushes the religious sentiment even to 
cism, and disdain for. human affairs to asceticism.

78. Puysican Asceticism.—It is no longer the- question 
of giving power to the body, and thus of making of it the 
robust instrument of a cultured spirit, as the. Greeks would. 
have it. The body is an enemy that must be subdued by 
fasting, by abstinence, and by mortifications of the flesh. 
** Do not allow Paula to eat in public, that is, do not let 
her take part in family entertainments, for fear that she 
may desire the meats that may be served there. Let her 
learn not to. use wine, for it is the source of all impurity. 
Let her food be vegetables, and only rarely of fish; and 
let her eat so as always to be hungry.” 
Contempt for the body is carried so far that cleanliness is 
almost interdicted. 
‘¢ For myself, I entirely forbid a young girl to bathe.” 
It is true that, alarmed at the consequences of such aus- 
terity, Saint Jerome, by way of exception, permits children 
the use of the bath, of wine, and of meat, but only ‘‘ when 
necessity requires it, and lest the feet may fail them before 
having walked.” 
74. IsreruectuaL anp Morar <Asceticism. — For the 
mind, as well as for the body, we may say of Saint Jerome 
what Nicole wrote to a nun of his time: ‘‘ You feed your 
pupils on bread and water.” The Bible is the only book 
recomniended, and this is little; but it is the Bible entire, 
which is too much. The Song of Songs, with its sensual 
imagery, would be strange reading fora young girl. The 
arts, like letters, find no favor with the mysticism of Saint 
Jerome.” 
“Never let Paula listen to musical instruments; let her 
even bé ignorant of the uses served by the flute and the *

not like; let it be so; but what shall we say of this condem-

nation of the harp, the instrument of David and th: | 
and of religious music itself! How far we are, in — 
with Saint Jerome, from that complete life, from that 
nious development of all the faculties, which moderi 
~ tors, Herbert Spencer, for example, present to 
reason as the ideal of education! Saint Jerome goe 
as to proscribe walking : — 
«Do not let Paula be found in the ways of the worl 
€ (emphatic paraphrase for streets), in the gatherings and i 
the company of her kindred; let her be found only i 
retirement.” 
The ideal of Saint Jerome is a monastic and clo | 
even in the world. But that which is graver still, 
is the fatal law of mysticism, is that Saint Je: 
having proseribed letters, arts, and necessary anc! 
pleasures, even brings his condemnation to bear « 
honorable sentiments of the heart. The heart 
also, and everything human is evil and full of dau,-. . 
‘Do not allow Paula to feel more affection for 
companions than for others ; do not allow her to 
such a one in an undertone.” And as he held in | 
even the affections of the family, the Doctor of * 1 
concludes thus : — : 
_ ‘Let her be educated in a cloister, where she will not 
know the world, where she will live as an angel, having a 
body but not knowing it, and where, in a word, you will be 
spared the care of watching over her.... If you willsend us 
Paula, I will charge myself with being her master and nurse ; 
I will give her my tenderest care; my old age will not pre- 
vent me from untying her tongue, and I shall be 
nowned than the philosopher Aristotle, since I shal 
not a mortal and perishable king, but an immortal . 3 
the Heavenly King.”’ &

75. Perwanent Trurus.— The. pious exaggerations of 
Saint Jerome only throw into. sharper relief the justice and 
the excellence of some of his practical suggestions, — upon 
the teaching of reading, for example, or upon the necessity 
of emulation : — 
. Put into the hands of Paula letters in wood_or in ivory, 
and teach her the names of them. She will thus learn while 
playing. But.it will not suffice to have her merely memorize 
the names of the letters, and call them in succession as they 
stand in the alphabet. You should often mix them, putting 
the last first, and the first in the middle. 
“Induce her to construct words by offering her a prize, 
or by giving her, as a reward, what ordinarily pleases chil- 
dren of her age.... Let her have companions, so that the 
commendation she may receive may excite in her the feeling 
of emulation. Do not chide her for the difficulty she may 
have in learning. On the contrary, encourage her by com- 
mendation, and proceed in such a way that she shall be 
equally sensible to the pleasure of having done well, and to 
the pain of not having been successful. ... .. Especially take 
care that she do not conceive a dislike .for study that might 
follow her into a more advanced age.”’! 
76. IsrectectcaL FEEsLenrss or THE Mippie AGE. — 
Tf the early doctors of the Church occasionally expressed 
some sympathy for profane letters, it is because, in their 
youth, before having received baptism, they had themselves 
attended the pagan schools. But these schools once closed, 
Christianity did not open others, and, after the fourth cen-) 
tury, a profound night enveloped humanity. The labor of 
the Greeks and the Romans was as though it never had

been. The past no longer existed. Humanity began anew. 
In the fifth century, Apollinaris Sidonius déclares that 
‘the young no longer study, that teachers no longer have 
pupils, and.that learning languishes and dies.” Later, Lupus 
of Ferriéres, the favorite of Louis the Pious and Charles the 
Bald, writes that the study of letters had almost ceased. “In 
‘the early part of the eleventh century, the Bishop of Laon, 
Adalberic, asserts that ‘‘ there is more than one bishop who 
cannot count the letters of the alphabet on his fingers.” In 
1291, of all the monks in the convent of Saint Gall, there 
was not one who could read and write. It was so difficult 
to find notaries public, that acts had to be passed verbally. 
The barons took pride in their ignorance. Even after the 
efforts of the twelfth century, instruction remained a luxury 
for the common people ; it was the privilege of the ecclesias- 
tics, and even they did not carry it very far. The Benedic- 
tines confess that the mathematics were studied only for the 
purpose of calculating the date of Easter. 
77. Causes oF THE IcNorANCE OF THE MippLE AcE. ~ 
What were the permanent causes of that situation which 
Jasted for ten centuries? The Catholic Church has some- 
times been held responsible for this. Doubtless the Chris- 
tian doctors did not always profess a very warm sympathy 
for intellectual culture. Saint Augustine had said: ‘* It is 
the ignorant who gain possession of heaven (ir = ™ 
rapiunt).” Saint Gregory the Great, a pope 
century, declared that he would blush to have th 
conform to the rules of grammar. Too many C 
a word, confounded ignorance with holiness. 
towards the seventh century, the darkness still 
over the Christian Church. Barbarians invaded. 
pate, and carried with them their rude manners.

also, during the feudal period the priest often became 
soldier, and remained ignorant. It would, however, be un- 
just to bring a constructive charge against the Church of the 
Middle Age, and to represent it as systematically hostile to 
instruction. Directly to the contrary, it is the clergy who, 
in the midst of the general barbarism, preserved some ves- 
tiges of the ancient culture. The only schools of that period 
are the episcopal and claustral schools, the first annexed to 
the bishops’ palaces, the second to the monasteries. The 
religious orders voluntarily associated manual. labor wit 
mental labor. As far back as 530, Saint Benedict founded | 
the convent of Monte Cassino, and drew up statutes which 
made reading and intellectual labor a part of the daily life 
of the monks. 
In 1179, the third Lateran Council promulgated the follow- 
ing decree :— 
“ The Church of God, being obliged like a good and ten- 
der mother to provide for the bodily and spiritual wants of 
the poor, desirous to procure for poor children the oppor- 
tunity for learning to read, and for making advancement in 
study, orders that each cathedral shall have a teacher charged. 
with the gratuitous instruction of the clergy of that church, 
and also of the indigent scholars, and that he be assigned a 
benefice, which, sufficient for his subsistence, may thus open 
the door of the school to the studious youth. A tutor? shall 
be installed in the other churches and in the monasteries 
where formerly there were funds set apart for this purpose.” 
It is not, then, to the Church that we must ascribe the

‘that there were three Renascences: the first, which owed its 
beginning to Charlemagne, and whose brilliancy did not last; 
the second, that of the twelfth century, the issue of which 
was Scholasticism; and the third, the great Renaissance of 
the sixteenth century, which still lasts, and which the French 
Revolution has completed. 
79, Cuartemagne. — Charlemagne undoubtedly formed the 
purpose of diffusing instruction about him. He ardently 
sought it for himself, drilled himself in writing, and learned 
Latin and Greek, rhetoric. and astronomy. He would have 
communicated to all who were about him the same ardor for 
study. ‘‘Ah! that I had twelve clerics,” he exclaimed, ‘‘ as 
perfectly instructed as were Jerome and Augustine!” It 
was naturally upon the clergy that he counted, to make of 
them the instruments of his plans; but, as one of his 
capitularies of 788 shows, there was need that the clergy 
themselves should be reminded of the need of instruction: 
‘““We have thought it useful that, in the bishops’ residences, 
and in the monasteries, care be taken not only to live accord- 
ing to the rules of our holy religion, but, in addition, to teach 
the knowlddge of letters to those who are capable of learning 
them by the aid of our Lord. Although it avails more to 
practise the law than to know it, it must be known before it 
can be practised. Several monasteries having sent us 
manuscripts, we have observed that, in the most of them, 
the sentiments were good, but the language bad. We 
exhort you, then, not only not to neglect the study of letters, 
bat to devote yourselves to them with all your power.” 
On the other hand, the nobles did not make any great 
effort to justify their social rank by the degree of theit 
knowledge. One day, as Charlemagne entered a school,

displeased with the indolence and the ignorance of the 
barons who attended it, he addressed them in these 
terms: ‘‘Do you count upon your birth, art 4+ ~-~ #-+7 - 
pride in it? Take notice that you shall hav: 
ment nor bishoprics, if you are not better 
others.” 
80, Ancuin (735-804). — Charlemagne was ser-~ 7 *

that he was the first minister of public instruction j 
It is he who founded the Palatine school, a sort o1 
and itinerant academy which followed the cow 
travels. It was a model school, where Alcuin had for hi: 
pupils the four sons and two daughters of Charlemagne, anc 
Charlemagne himself, always eager to be instructed. 
Alcuin’s method was not without originality, T ‘ *' ° 
great mistake to say that it resembles the method o: 
Alcuin doubtless proceeds by interrogation; but _..._ __ .

wretched it is a sorrow, a waiting for death. ae 
sleep? The image of death. What is writing? It is ¢] 
guardian of history. What is the body? The teneme 
of the soul. What is day? A summons to labor.”? 
All this is either commonplace or artificial. ‘™~ --

ing the memory ; but in this procedure of the m 
affected by the over-refinements of his time, ther

Nevertheless the name of Alcuin marks an era in the 
history of education. His was the first attempt to form an 
alliance between classical literature and Christian inspiration, 
— to create a ‘ Christian Athens,” according to the emphatic. 
phrase of Alcuin himself. 
81, Tur Successors or CHARLEMAGNE. -—It had been the 
ambition of Charlemagne to reign over a civilized society, 
rather than over a barbarous people. Convinced that the 
only basis of political unity is a unity of ideas and of morals, 
he thought to find the basis of that moral unity in religion, 
and religion itself he purposed to establish upon a more 
widely diffused system of instruction. But these ideas were 
too advanced for the time, and their execution too difficult 
for the circumstances then existing. A new decadence fol- 
lowed the era of Charlemagne. The clergy did not respond 
to the hopes which the great emperor had placed on them. 
As far back as 817, the Council of Aix-la-Chapelle decided 
that henceforth no more day-pupils should be received into 
the conventual schools, for the reason that too large a num- 
ber of pupils would make impossible the maintenance of the 
monastic discipline. No one of Charlemagne’s successors 
seems to have taken up the thought of the great emperor; 
no one of them was preoccupied with the problems of educa- 
tion. It is upon despotic authority, and not upon the intel- 
lectual progress of their subjects, that those unintelligent 
rulers wished to found their power. Under Louis the Pious 
and Charles the Bald there were constructed more castles 
than schools. 
The kings.of France were far from imitating the Anglo- 
Saxon king, Alfred the Great (849-901), to whom tradition 
ascribes these two sayings: ‘‘ The English ought always to 
be free, as free as their own thoughts” ; ‘‘ Free-born sons 
should know how to read and write.”

14 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
82. Scioasricism. — It was not till the twelfth century 
that the human mind was awakened. That was the age of 
Scholasticism, the essential character of which was the study 
of reasoning, and the practice of dialectics, or ‘syllogistic 
reasoning. The syllogism, which reaches necessary con- 
clusions from given premises, was the natural instrument of 
an age of faith, when men wished simply to demonstrate 
immutable dogmas, without ever making an innovation on 
established beliefs. It has often been observed that the art 
of reasoning is the science of a people still in the early stage 
of its progress ; we might almost say of a barbarous people. 
A subtile dialectic is in perfect keeping with manners still 
rude, and with a limited state of knowledge. It is only an 
intellectual machine. It was not then a question of 
original thinking. All that was necessary was simply to 
reason upon conceptions already acquired, and the sacred 
depository of these was kept in charge by Theology. Con- 
sequently, there was no independent science. Philosophy, 
according to the language of the times, was but the humble 
servant of Theology. The dialectics of the doctors of the 
Middle Age was but « subtile commentary on the sacred 
books and on the doctrines of Aristotle.! It seems, says 
Locke, to see the inertness of the Middle Age, that God was 
pleased to make of mana two-footed animal, while leaving 
to Aristotle the task of making him a thinking being. From 
his point of view, an able educator of the seventeenth cen- 
tury, the Abbé Fleury, pronounces this severe > judgment on 
the scholastic method : — 
1 The following quotation illustrates this servile dependence on authority: 
“At the time when the discovery of spots on the sun first began to circu- 
late, a student called the attention of his old professor to the rumor, and 
received the following reply: ‘There can be no spots on the sun, for I have 
read Aristotle twice from beginning to end, and he says the sun is incor- 
ruptible. Clean your lenses, and if the spots are not in the telescope, they 
must be in your eyes!”’”? Naville, La Logique de l’Hypothése. (P.)
-P-A-G-E-103
THE EARLY CHRISTIANS AND THE MIDDLE AGE. 7 
*¢ This way of philosophizing on words and thoughts, with- 
out examining the things themselves, was certainly an easy 
‘way of getting along without a knowledge of facts, which 
ean be acquired only by reading” (Fleury should have added 
and by observation) ; ‘and it was an easy way of dazzling 
the ignorant laics by peculiar terms and vain subtilties.” 
But Scholasticism had its hour of glory, its erudite doc- 
tors, its eloquent professors, chief among whom was Abelard. 
83. ABELARD (1079-1142).— A genuine professor of 
higher instruction, Abelard, by the prestige of his eloquence, 
gathered around him at Paris thousands of students. Hu- 
man speech, the living words of the teacher, had then an 
authority, an importance, which it’ has lost in part since 
books, ‘everywhere distributed, have, to a certain extent, 
superseded oral instruction. At a time when printing did 
not exist, when manuscript copies were rare, a teacher who 
combined knowledge with the gift of speech was a phenome- 
non of incomparable interest, and students flocked from all 
parts of Europe’ to take advantage of his lectures. Abelard 
is the most brilliant representative of the scholastic pedagogy, 
with an original and personal tendeacy towards the emanci- 
pation of the mind. ‘It is ridiculous,” he said, ‘‘ to preach 
to others what we can neither make them understand, nor 
understand ourselves.” With more boldness than Saint 
Anselm, he applied dialectics to theology, and attempted to 
zeason out the grounds of his faith. 
84. Tae Seven Liperat Arts.—The seven liberal arts 
tonstituted what may be-called the secondary instruction of 
the Middle Age, such as was given in the claustral or con- 
ventual schools, and later, in the universities. The liberal 
arts were distributed into two courses of study, known as the 
trivium and the quadrivium. The trivium comprised grani- 
mar (Latin grammar, of course), dialectics, or logic, snd

rhetoric; and the guadrivium, music, arithmetic, geometry, 
and astronomy. It is important to note the fact that this 
programme contains only abstract and formal studies, —- no 
real and concrete studies. The sciences which teach us to 
know man and the world, such as history, ethics, the physical 
and natural sciences, were omitted and unknown, save per- 
haps in a few convents of the Benedictines. Nothing which 
can truly educate man, and develop his faculties as a whole, 
enlists the attention of the Middle Age. From s,

Saint Angelm, ‘‘we do not cease to chastise the children 
confided to our care, and they grow worse and worse.” 
Anselm replied, “‘Indeed! You do not cease to chastise 
them! And when they are grown up, what will they become?

brutes of men!... If you were to plant a tree in your 
garden, and were to enclose it on all sides so that it could 
not extend its branches, what would you find when, at the end 
of several years, you set it free from its bands? “A tree 
whose branches would be bent and crooked; and would it 
not be your fault, in having so unreasonably confined it?” 
86. Tue Untversitizrs.— Save claustral and cathedral 
schools, to which must be added some parish schools, the 
earliest example of our village schools, the sole educational’ 
establishment of the Middle Age was what is called the Uni- 
versity. Towards the thirteenth and fourteenth century we 
see multiplying in the great cities of Europe those centres of 
study, those collections of students which recall from afar 
the schools of Plato and Aristotle. Of such establishments 
were the university which opened at Paris for the teaching 
of theology and philosophy (1200); the universities of 
Naples (1224), of Prague (1345), of Vienna (1865), of 
Heidelberg (1386), etc." Without being completely affran- 
chised from sacerdotal control, these universities were a first 
expansion of free science. As far back as the ninth century, 
the Arabs had given an example to the rest of Europe by 
founding at Salamanca, at Cordova, and in other cities of 
Spain, schools where all the sciences were cultivated.

lectics disappear to let the heart speak and make way for 
feeling. The Chancellor of the University of Paris is distin- 
guished from the men of his time by his love for the people. 
He wrote in the common tongue little elementary treatises 
for the use and within the comprehension of the plain people. - 
His Latin work, entitled De parvulis ad Christum trahendis 
(‘ Little children whom we must lead to Christ”), gives 
evidence of a large spirit of sweetness and goodness. It 
abounds in subtile and delicate observations. For exam- 
ple, Gerson demands of teachers patience and tenderness: 
‘‘ Little children,” he says, ‘‘ are more easily managed by 
caresses than by fear.” For these frail creatures he dreads 
the contagion of example. ‘* No living being is more in 
danger than the child of allowing himself to be corrupted by 
another child.” In his eyes, the little child is a delicate 
plant that must be carefully protected against every evil in- 
fluence, and, in particular, against pervicious literature, such 
as the Roman dela Rose. Gerson condemns corporal Pupils ) 
ment, and requires that teachers shall have for their. pupils 
the affection of a father : — 
‘¢ Above all else, let the teacher make an effort to bea 
father to his pupils. Let him never be angry with them. 
Let him always be simple in his instruction, and relate to his 
pupils that which is wholesome and agreeable.” Tender- 
hearted and exalted spirit, Gerson is a precursor of Fenelon." 
88. Virrortno pa Ferrre (1379-1446).—It is a pleas-

the celebrated Vittorino da Feltre, a professor in the Uni-

his aptitude for educational work. With him, education 
again became what it was in Greece, —the harmonious devel-

swimming, riding, fencing, restored to honor; attention to 
the exterior qualities of fine bearing; an interesting and 
agreeable method of instruction ; a constant effort to discover | | 
the character and aptitudes of children; a conscientious ,- 
preparation for each lesson ; assiduous watchfulness over the 
work of pupils; such are the principal features of the peda. 
gogy of Vittorino da Feltre, a system of teaching eviden 
in advance of his time, and one which deserves a longer 
study. 
89. Orner Tzacuers at tHe Chose or THe Mippie AcE. 
—Were we writing a work of erudition, there would be 
other thinkers to point out in the last years of the Middle 
Age, in that uncertain and, so to speak, twilight period 
which serves as a transition from the night of the Middle 
Age to the full day of the Renaissance. Among others, let 
us notice the Chevalier de la Tour-Landry and Aneas Sylvius 
Piccolomini. 
The Chevalier de la Tour-Landry, i in the work which he 
wrote for the education of his daughters (1372), scarcely rises 
above the spirit of his time. Woman, as he thinks, is made 
to pray and to go to church. The model which he sets be- 
fore his daughters is a countess, who ‘‘each day wished to 
hear three masses.” He recommends fasting three times a 
week in order ‘‘ the better to subdue the flesh,” and to pre- 
vent it “from diverting itself too much.” There is neither 
responsibility nor proper dignity for the wife, who owes 
obedience to her husband, her lord, and ‘‘ should do his will,

whether wrong or right; if wrong, she is absolved from 
lame, as the blame falls on her lord.” 
/ Mineas Sylvius, the future Pope Pius IL., in his tract on 
(The Education of Children (1451), is already a man of the 
Renaissance, since he recommends with enthusiasm the read- 
ing and study of most of the classical authors. However, 
he traces a programme of studies relatively liberal. By the 
side of the humanities he places the sciences of geometry 
and arithmetic, ‘‘ which are necessary,” he says, ‘‘ for train- 
ing the mind and assuring rapidity of conceptions”; and 
also history and geography. He had himself composed his- 
torical narratives accompanied by maps. The distrusts of 
an overstrained devotion were no longer felt by a teacher 
“Who wrote, “There is nothing in the world more precious 
or more beautiful than an enlightened intelligence.” 
90. RecaprruLation. — It is thus that the Middle Age in 
drawing to a close came nearer and nearer, in the way of 
continuous progress, to the decisive emancipation which the 
Renaissance and the Reformation were soon to perpetuate. 
But the Middle Age, in itself, whatever effort may be put 
forth at this day to rehabilitate it, and to discover in it 
the golden age of modern societies, remains an ill-starred 
epoch. A few virtues, negative for.the most part, virtues 
of obedience and consecration, cannot atone for the real 
faults of those rude and barbarous centuries. A higher 
education reserved to ecclesiastics and men of noble rank ; 
an instruction which consisted in verbal legerdemain, which 
developed only the mechanism of reasoning, and made of 
the intelligence a prisoner of the formal syllogism; agreea- 
bly to the barbarism of primitive times, a fantastic pedantry 
which lost itself in superficial discussions and in verbal 
distinctions ; popular education almost null, and restricted to

the teaching of the catechism in Latin; finally, a Church, 
absolute and sovereign, which determined for all, great and 
small, the limits of thought, of belief, and of action; such 
was, from our own point of view, the condition of the Mid- 
dle Age. It was time for the coming of the Renaissance to 
affranchise the human mind, to excite and to reveal to itself 
the unconscious need of instruction, and by the fruitful 
alliance of the Christian spirit and profane letters, to prepare 
for the coming of modern education. 
(91. Anatyrican Summary.—1. The fundamental char- 
acteristic of Middle Age education was the domination of 
religious conceptions. The training was for the life to come, 
rather than for this life; it was almost exclusively religious 
and moral ; was based on authority ; and included the whole 
human race. 
2. This alliance of church and school, while giving an 
exclusive aim to education, also gave it.a spirit of intense 
seriousness and earnestness. The survivals of this histori- 
cal alliance are church and parish schools, and a disposition 
of the modern Church to dispute the right of the State to 
educate. : 
8. The supreme importance attached to the Scriptures 
made education literary; made instruction dogmatic and 
arbitrary ; exalted words over things; inculcated a taste for 
abstract and formal reasoning ; made learning a process of 
memorizing ; and stifled the spirit of free inquiry. 
4, The inclusion of the whole world in one Christian 
Commonwealth, led to the intellectual enfranchisement of 
woman and to the rise of primary education proper. 
5. The general tendency was towards harshness in disci- 
vline, coarseness in habits and manners, and a contempt for 
the amenities of life.

6. Scholasticism erred by exaggeration; but its general 
effect was to develop the power of deductive reasoning, to 
teach the use of language as the instrument of thought, and 
to make apparent the need of nice discriminations in the use 
of words.

difficulty of attaining compass, symmetry, and moderation.}

tae Srxrgenta Century. — Modern education begins with 
the Renaissance. The educational methods that we then 
begin to discern will dotibtless not be developed and 
perfected till. a later period; the new doctrines will pass 
into practice only gradually, and with the general progress 
of the times. But from the sixteenth century education 
is in possession of its essential principles.. The educa- 
tion of the Middle Age, over-rigid and repressive, which 
condemned the body to a régime too severe, and the 
wind to a discipline too narrow, is to be succeeded,
-P-A-G-E-112
84 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
at least in theory, by an education broader and more 
liberal; which will give due attention to hygiene and 
physical exercises; which will enfranchise the intelligence, 
hitherto the prisoner of the syllogism; which will call inte 
play the moral forces, instead of repressing them; which 
will substitute real studies for the verbal subtilties of dia- 
lectics ; which will give the preference to things over words ; 
which, finally, instead of developing but a single faculty, the 
reason, and instead of reducing man to a sort of dialectic 
automaton, will seek to develop the whole man, mind and 
body, taste and knowledge, heart and will. 
93. Causes or THE RENAISSANCE IN Epucation. — The 
men of the sixteenth century having renewed with classical 
antiquity an intercourse that had been too long interrupted, 
it was natural that they should propose to the young the 
study of the Greeks and the Romans. What is called 
secondary instruction really dates from the sixteenth cen- 
tury. The crude works of the Middle Age are succeeded by 
the elegant compositions of Athens and Rome, henceforth 
made accessible to all through the art of printing; and, witl 
the reading of the ‘ancient authors, there reappear through the 
fruitful effect of imitation, their qualities of correctness in 
thought, of literary taste, and of elegance in form. In 
France, as in Italy, the national tongues, moulded, and, 
as it were, consecrated by writers of genius, become the 
instruments of an intellectual propaganda. Artistic taste, 
revived by the rich products of a race of incomparable artists, 
gives an extension to the horizon of life, and creates a new 
class of emotions. Finally, the Protestant Reform develops 
individual thought and free inquiry, and at the same time, 
by its success, it imposes still greater efforts on the Catholie 
Church.
-P-A-G-E-113
———_-_ THE RENAISSANCE. 85 
This is not saying that everything is faultless in the edu- 
eational efforts of the sixteenth century. First, as is natural 
for innovators, the thought of the teachers of this period is 
marked by enthusiasm rather than by precision. ‘They are 
more zealous in pointing out the end to be attained, than 
exact in determining the means to be employed. Besides, 
some of them are content to emancipate the mind, but forget 
to give it proper direction. Finally, others make a wrong 
use of the ancients; they are too much preoccupied with the 
form and the purity of language ; they fall into Ciceromania, 
and it is not their fault if a new superstition, that of rhetoric, 
does not succeed the old superstition, that of the syllogism. 
94, Tae TuEory anD THE Practice or Epucation IN 
az Srxteenta Century. — In the history of education in the 
xteenth century, we must, moreover, carefully distinguish 
ie theory from the practice. The theory of education is 
lready boldly put forward, and is in advance of its age; 
‘hile the practice is still dragging itself painfully along on 
ie beaten road, notwithstanding some successful attempts 
t improvement. 
The theory we must look for in the works of Erasmus, 
tabelais, and Montaigne, of whom it may be said, that before 
retending to surpass them, even at this day, we should 
ather attempt to overtake them, and to equal them in the 
aost of their pedagogical precepts. 
The practice is, first, the development of the study of the 
umanities, particularly in the early colleges of the Jesuits, 
and, before the Jesuits, in certain Protestant colleges, partic- 
larly in the college at Strasburg, so brilliantly administered 
y the celebrated Sturm (1507-1589). ‘Then it is the revival 
f higher instruction, denoted particularly by the foundation 
f the College of France (1530), and by the brilliant lec-°

tures of Ramus. Finally, it is the progress, we might 
almost say the birth, of primary instruction, through the 
efforts of the Protestant reformers, and especially of Luther. 
Nevertheless, the educational thought of the sixteenth 
century is in advance of educational practice; theories 
greatly anticipate applications, and constitute almost all that 
is deserving of special note. 
95. Erasmus (1467-1536).— By his numerous writings, 
translations, grammars, dictionaries, and original w: 
Erasmus diffused about him his own passionate fon 
classical literature, and communicated this taste 4o his con- 
temporaries. Without having a direct influence on education, 
since he scarcely taught himself, he encouraged the study of 
the ancients by his example, and by his a¢tive propagan- 
dism. The scholar who said, ‘‘ When I have money, I will 
first buy Greek books and then clothes,/ deserves to be 
placed in the first rank among the creators of secondary 
instruction.     
      
   96. Tae EpucaTion or Erasmus:/ 1He Jeromires. — 
Erasmus was educated by the monks, as Voltaire was by the 
Jesuits, a circumstance that has cost / these liberal thinkers 
none of their independent dispositign, and none of their 
satirical spirit. At the age of twelve, Erasmus entered the 
college of Deventer, in Holland.” This college was con- 
dueted by the Jeromites, or Brethren of the Common Life. 
Founded in 1340 by Gerard Groot, the associatic 
Jeromites undertook, among other occupations, th: 
tion of children. Very mystical, and very ascetic 
the disciples of Gerard Groot restricted themselves 
ing the Bible, to reading, and writing. They prosiivcu, as 
useless to piety, letters and the sciences. But in the 
fifteenth century, under the influence of John of Wessel and

88 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
On the Manner of writing Letters, Upon Rules of Etiquette 
for the Young, etc. We may also notice his Adages, a vast 
repertory of proverbs and maxims borrowed from antiquity ; 
his Colloguies, a collection of dialogues for the use of the 
young, though the author here treats of many things which 
a pupil should never hear spoken of. Another category 
should include works of a more theoretical character, in 
which Erasmus sets forth his ideas on education. In the 
essay On the Order of Study (de Ratione Studii), he seeks out 
the rules for instruction in literature, for the study of gram- 
mar, for the cultivation of the memory, and for the explica- 
tion of the Greek and Latin authors. Another treatise, 
entitled Of the First Liberal Education of Children (De pueris 
statim ac liberaliter instituendis) , is still more important, and 
covers the whole field of education. Erasmus here studies 
the character of the child, the question of knowing whether 
the first years-of child-life can be turned to good account, 
and the measures that are to be taken with early life. He 
also recommends methods that are attractive, and heartily 
condemns the barbarous discipline which reigned in the 
schools of his time. 
98. JuveniLe Eviquetre.— Erasmus is one of the first 
educators who comprehended the importance of politeness. 
In an age still uncouth, wliere the manners of even the cul- 
tivated classes tolerated usages that the most ignorant rustic 
of to-day would scorn, it was good to call the attention to 
outward appearances and the duties of politeness. Eras- 
mus knew perfectly well that politeness has a moral side, 
that it is not a matter of pure convention, but that it pro- 
ceeds from the inner disposition of a well-ordered soul. So 
he assigns it an important place in education : 
“The duty of instructing the young,” he says, ‘‘ includes 
several elements, the first and also the chief of which is,
-P-A-G-E-117
THE RENAISSANCE. : 89 
that the tender mind of the child should be instructed in’ 
piety ; the second, that he love and learn the liberal arts; 
the third, that he be taught tact in the conduct of social 
life; and the fourth, that from his earliest age he accustom 
himself to good. behavior, based on moral principles.’’ ’ 
We need not be astonished, however, to find that the 
civility of Erasmus is still imperfect, now too free, now too 
exacting, and always ingenuous. ‘‘It is a religious duty,” 
he says, ‘‘ to salute him who sneezes.” ‘* Morally speaking, 
it is not a proper thing to throw the head back while drink- 
ing, after the manner of storks, in order to drain the last 
drop from the glass.” ‘If one let bread fall on the ground, 
he should kiss it after having picked it up.” On the other 
hand, Erasmus seems to allow that the nose may be wiped. 
with the fingers, but he forbids the use of the cap or the 
sleeve for this purpose. He requires that the face shall be 
bathed with pure water in the morning; ‘‘ but,” he adds, 
“to repeat this afterwards is nonsense.”’ 
99. Earty Epvucation. — Like Quintilian, by whom he is. 
often inspired, Erasmus does ‘not scorn to enter the primary: 
school, and to shape the first exercises for intellectual cul- 
tare. Upon many points, the thought of the sixteenth cen- 
tury scholar is but an echo of the Institutes of Oratory, or. 
of the educational essays of Plutarch. Some of his maxims: 
deserve to be reproduced: ‘‘ We learn with great willingness 
from those whom we love;” ‘‘ Parents themselves cannot 
properly bring up their children if they make themselves 
only to be feared;” ‘* There are children who. would be 
killed sooner than made better by blows: by mildness and 
kind adnionitions, one. may make of them whatever he 
will;” ‘‘Children will iearn to speak their native tongue: 
without any weariness, by usage -and practice ;.” ‘+ Drill in 
reading and writing is a little bit tiresome, and the teacher
-P-A-G-E-118
90 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
will ingeniously palliate the tedium by the artifice of an 
attractive method;” ‘*The ancients moulded toothsome 
dainties into the forms of the letters, and thus, as it were, 
made children swallow the alphabet;” ‘‘In the matter of 
grammatical rules, instruction should at the first be limited 
to the most simple ;” ‘‘ As the body in infant years is nour- 
ished by little portions distributed at intervals, so should 
the mind of the child be nurtured by items of knowledge 
adapted to its weakness, and distributed little by little.’’ 
From out, these quotations there appears a method of 
instruction that is kindly, lovable, and full of tenderness for 
the young. Erasmus claims for them the nourishing care 
and caresses of the mother, the familiarity and goodness cf 
the father, cleanliness, and even elegance in the school, and 
finally, the mildness and indulgence of the teacher. 
100. Tue Instruction or Women.—The i * ~ . 
the Renaissance did not exclude women from all 
tion in the literary treasures that a recovered an 
disclosed to themselves. Erasmus admits them 
share. 
In the Colloquy of the Abbé and the Educat: 
Magdala claims for herself the right to learn Latiu, © 2v uae 
she may hold converse each day with so many authors who 
are so eloquent, so instructive, so wise, and such g 
sellors.” In the book called Christian Marriage, 
banters young ladies who learn only to make a bow, wo ua 
the hands crossed, to bite their lips when they laugh, to eat 
and drink as little as possible at table, after having 
ample portions in private. More ambitious for the 
Erasmus recommends her to pursue the studies whic| 
assist her in educating her own children, and in taking) 
in-the intellectual life of her husband.
-P-A-G-E-119
THE RENAISSANCE. ot 
Vives, a contemporary of Erasmus (1492-1540), a Span- 
ish teacher, expressed analogous ideas in his books on the 
education of women, in which he recommends young women 
to read Plato and Seneca. 
To.sum up, the pedagogy of Erasmus is not without value ; 
but with him, education ran the risk of remaining exclusively 
Greek and Latin. A humanist above everything else, he 
granted but very small place to the sciences, and to history, 
which it sufficed to skim over, as he said; and, what reveals 
his inmost nature, he recommended the study of the physical 
sciences for this reason in particular, that the writer will find 
in the knowledge of nature an abundant source of metaphors, 
images, and comparisons. 
101. Raperars (1483-1553).— Wholly different is the 
spirit of Rabelais, who, under a fanciful and original form, 
has sketched a complete system of education. Some pages 
of marked gravity in the midst of the epic vagabondage of 
his burlesque work, give him the right to appear in the first 
rank among those who have reformed the art of training and 
developing the human soul.’ 
The pedagogy of Rabelais is the first appearance of what 
may be called realism in instruction, in distinction from the 
scholastic formalism. The author of Gargantua turns the 
mind of the young man towards objects truly worthy of oc- 
cnpying his attention. He catches a glimpse of the future 
reserved to scientific education, and to the study of nature. 
He invites the mind, not to the labored subtilties and com- 
plicated tricks which scholasticism had brought into fashion, 
but to manly efforts, and to a wide unfolding of human 
nature. ©

82 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
102. Crriricism or THE OLD Epucatton: GARGANTUA AND 
Evupremon.—In the manners of the sixteenth century, the 
keen satire of Rabelais found many opportunities for dis- 
porting itself; and his book may be regarded as a collection 
of pamphlets. But there is nothing that he has pursued 
with more sarcasms than the education of his day. 
At the outset, Gargantua is educated according to the| 
scholastic methods. He works for twenty years with all his| 
might, and learns so perfectly the books that he studies that 
he can recite them by heart, backwards and forwards, ‘‘ and 
yet his father discovered that all this: profited him r “*” 
and what is worse, that it made him a madcap, 4 
dreamy, and infatuated.” 
To that unintelligent and artificial trainin~ ~**-* ~~~ 
charges the memory, which holds the pupil f: 
over insipid books, which robs the mind of al 
activity, which dulls rather than sharpens the i 
to all this Rabelais opposes a natural education, 
to experience and to facts, which. trains the yc -, —-- 
only for the discussions of the schools, but for real life, and 
for intercourse with the world, and which, finally, e: "~~ | 
the intelligence and adorns the memory without: stifli 
native graces and the free activities of the spirit. 
Eudemon, who, in Rabelais’ romance, represents th: 
trained by the new methods, knows how to think with 
racy and speak with facility; his bearing is v ~~ 
ness, but with confidence. When introduced to 
he turns towards him, ‘‘cap in hand, with open: -.____u. 
ruddy lips, steady eyes, and with modesty becoming : 
youth”; he salutes him elegantly and graciou:* ™ 
the pleasant things which Eudemon says to him 
finds nothing to say in reply: ‘‘ His countenan 
as though he had taken to crying immoderately

face in his cap, and not a single word could be drawn from 
him.” 
In these two pupils, so different in manner, Rabelais hav 
personified two contrasted methods of education: that which, 
by mechanical exercises of memory, enfeebles and dullg 
the intelligence; and that which, with larger grants c) 
_ liberty, develops keen intelligences, and frank and open 
characters. 
103. Tue New Epvucatron.— Let us now notice with 
some detail how Rabelais conceives this new education. 
After having thrown into sharp relief the faults con- 
tracted by Gargantua in the school of his first teachers, he 
entrusts him to a preceptor, Ponocrates, who is charged with 
correcting his faults, and with re-moulding him; he is to 
employ his own principles in the government of his pupil. 
Ponoerates proceeds slowly at first; he considers that 
“nature does not endure sudden changes without great 
violence.” He studies and observes his pupil; he wishes to 
judge of his natural disposition. Then he sets himself to _ 
work ; he undertakes a general recasting of the character and 
spirit of Gargantua, while directing, at the same time, his 
physical, intellectual, and moral education. 
104. Puysicat. Envcation. — Hygiene and gymnastics, 
cleanliness which protects the body, and exercise which 
strengthens it, — these two essential parts of physical edu- 
  
1 The contrast between the general system of education that culmin- 
ated with the Reformation, and the system that had its rise at the same 
period, is so marked that there is an histurical propriety in calling the first 
the old education, and the second, or later, the new education. Recollect- 
ing the tendency of the human mind to pass from one extreme to an 
epposite extreme; we may suspect that the final state of educational 
thonght and practice will represent a mean between these two contrasted 
systems: it id inconceivable that the old was wholly wrong, or that the 
yew is wholly right. (P.)

cation receive equal attention from Rabelais. Erasmus 
thought it was nonsense (‘‘ ne rime rien”) to wash more 
than once a day. Gargantua, on the contrary, after eating, 
bathes his hands and his eyes in fresh water. Rabelais does 
not forget that he has been a physician; he omits no detail 
relative to the care of the body, even the most repugnant. 
He is far from believing, with the mystics of the Middle 
Age, that it is permissible to lodge knowledge in a sordid 
body, and that a foul or neglected exterior is not unbefitting 
virtuous souls. The first preceptors of Gargantua said that 
it sufficed to comb one’s hair ‘“ with the four fingers and the 
thumb; and that whoever combed, washed, and cleansed 
himself otherwise, was losing his time in this world.” With 
Ponocrates, Gargantua reforms his habits, and tries 
semble Eudemon, ‘‘ whose hair was so neatly combe 
was so well dressed, of such fine appearance, and 1 
modest in his bearing, that he much more resembled #1 
angel than a man.” 
Rabelais attaches equal importance to gymnastics, to walk- 
. Ing, and to active life in the open air. He does not allow 
Gargantua to grow pale over his books, and to protr: 
study into the night. After the morning’s lessons, he 
him out to play. Tennis and ball follow the applica 
books : ‘‘ He exercises his body just as vigorously as 
before exercised his mind.” And so, after the study ur vue 
afternoon till the supper hour, Gargantua devotes his time 
to physical exercises. Riding, wrestling, 
species of physical recreation, gymnastics u

hours, in order that a real man could find the time to do all 
that the author of Gargantua requires of his giant. In con- 
trast with the long asceticism of the Middle Age, he proposes 
a real revelry of gymnastics for the colossal body of his hero. 
We will not forget that here, as in all the other parts of 
Rabelais’ work, fiction is ever mingled with fact. Rabelais 
wrote for giants, and it is natural that he should demand 
gigantesque efforts of them. In order to comprehend the 
exact thought of the author, it is necessary to reduce his 
fantastic exaggerations to human proportions. 
105. InrettectuaL Epucation. — For the mind, as for 
the body, Rabelais requires prodigies of activity. Gargantua 
rises at four in the morning, and the greater part of the long 
day is filled with study. Tor the indolent contemplations of 
the Middle Age, Rabelais substitutes an incessant effort and 
an intense activity of the mind. Gargantua first studies the 
ancient languages, and the first place is given to Greek, 
which Rabelais rescues from the long discredit into which it 
had fallen in the Middle Age, as is proved by the vulgar 
adage, ‘‘ Greecum est, non legitur.”” 
“ Now, all disciplines are restored, and the languages rein- 
stated, —- Greek (without which it is a shame for a person 
to call himself learned), Hebrew, Chaldean, Latin. There 
are very elegant and correct editions in use, which have been 
invented in my age by divine inspiration, as, on the other 
hand, artillery was invented by diabolic suggestion. The 
whole world is full of wise men, of learned teachers, and of 
very large libraries, and it is my opinion that neither in the 
time of Plato nor in that of Cicero, nor in that of Papinian, 
were there such opportunities for study as we see to-day.” 
Like all his contemporaries, Rabelais is an enthusiast in 
classical learning ; but he is distinguished from them by a

who, moreover, flattered themselves that they could discover 
at the end of their syllogisms all that was necessary to know 
about it. Rabelais is-certainly the first, in point of tim: 
that grand school of educators who place the sciences ix 
first rank among the studies worthy of human thought. 
The scholar of the Middle Age knew. nothing of the 
world. Gargantua requires of his son that he shall know it 
under all its aspects : 
“« As to the knowledge of the facts of nature,” he —~ 
to Pantagruel, ‘‘ I would have you devote yourself to

recommends his pupils to go and read the Georgics of Virgil 
in the midst of meadows and woods. ‘The precursor of 
Rousseau on this point as upon some others, he thinks there 
is a gain in spiritual health by refreshing the imagination and 
giving repose to the spirit, through the contemplation of the 
beauties of nature. 
Ponocrates, in order to afford Gargantua distraction from 
his extreme attention to study, recommended once each 
month some very clear and serene day, on which they set out 
at an early hour from the city, and went to Chantilly, or 
Boulogne, or Montrouge, or Pont Charenton, or Vannes, or 
Saint Cloud. And there they passed the whole day in play- 
ing, singing, dancing, frolicking in some fine meadow, 
hunting for sparrows, collecting pebbles, fishing for frogs 
and crabs. 
107. Osszct Lessons. —In the scheme of studies planned 
by Rabelais, the mind of the pupil is always on the alert, 
even at table. There, instruction takes place while talking. 
The conversation bears upon the food, upon the objects 
which attract the attention of Gargantua, upon the nature 
and properties of water, wine, bread, and salt. Every sen- 
sible object becomes material for questions and explanations. 
Gargantua often takes walks across fields, and he studies 
hotany in the open country, ‘‘ passing through meadows or 
other grassy places, observing trees and plants, comparing 
them with ancient books where they are described, . . . and 
taking handfuls of them home.” There are but few didactic 
“essons; intuitive instruction, given in the presence of the 
objects themselves, such is the method of Rabelais. It is 
in the same spirit that he sends his pupil to visit the stores 
of the silversmiths, the founderies, the alchemists’ labora-

this abuse of superficial practices, is a real feeling of piety,’ , 
and the direct reading of the sacred texts: ‘It‘is while 
Gargantua was being dressed that there was read, to him a 
page of Divine Scripture.”" Still more, it is the intimate and 
personal adoration “ of the great psalmodist of the'u iyerse,”” 
excited by the study of the works of God. Gargai tod ‘abd 
his master, Ponoerates, have scarcely risen when ‘they observe 
the state of the heavens, and admire the celestial vault. In 
the evening they devote themselves to the same contempla- 
ion. After his meals, as before going to sleep, Gargantua 
fers prayers to God, to adore Him, to confirm his faith, to 
‘lorify Him for His boundless goodness, to thank Him for 
il the time past, and to recommend himself to Him for the 
ime tocome. The religious feeling of Rabelais proceeds at 
‘he same. time, both from the sentiment which provoked the 
?rotestant Reformation, of which he came near being an 
idherent, and from tendencies still more modern, —those, for 
xample, which animate the deistic philosophy of Rousseau. 
110. Mora Epucarion. — Those who know Rabelais only 
oy reputation, or through some of his innumerable drolleries, 
will perhaps be astonished that the jovial author can be 
wunted a teacher of morals. It is impossible, however, to 
nisunderstand the sincere and lofty inspiration of such pas- 
sages as this : 
“ Because, according to the wise Solomon, wisdom does 
aot enter into a malevolent soul, and knowledge without con- 
science is but the ruin of the soul; it becomes you to serve, to 
love, and to fear God, and to place on Him all your thoughts, . 
1 Rabelais recommends the study of Hebrew, so that the sacred books 
way be known in their original form. In some place he says: ‘‘I love much 
more to hear the Gospel than to hear the life of Saint Margaret or some 
other cant,”

Apply not your heart to vanity, for this life is transitory ; 
" put the word of God endures forever. Be useful to all your 
neighbors, and love them as yourself. Revere your teachers, 
flee the company of men whom you would not resemble ; and 
{ieigrace which God has given you receive not in vain. And 
when you think you have all the knowledge that can be ac- 
auired by this means, return to me, so that I may see you, 
and give you my benediction before I die.”* 
111. Mowrarenn (1533-1592) anp Rapetais. — Between 
Erasmus, the learned humanist, exclusively devoted to belles- 
lettres, and Rabelais, the bold innovator, who extends as far 
as possible the limits of the intelligence, and who causes the 
etitire encyclopedia of human knowledge to enter the brain 
of his pupil at the risk of splitting it open, Montaigne 
occupies an intermediate place, with his circumspect and 
conservative tendencies, with his discreet and moderate ped-~ 
agogy, the enemy of all excesses. It seemed that Rabelais 
would develop all the faculties equally, and place all 
studies, letters, and sciences upon the same footing. Mon- 
taigne demands a choice. Between the different faculties he 
attempts particularly to train the judgment; among the dif- 
ferent knowledges, he recommends by preference those which 
form sound and sensible minds. Rabelais overdrives mind 
and body. He dreams of an extravagant course of instruc- 
tion where every science shall be studied exhaustively.” 
  
1 Book II. chap. var. . 
2 This pansophic scheme of Rabelais has been revived in later times by 
Bentham, in his Chrestomathia, and still later by Spencer, in his Educa- 
tion. It seems to have been forgotten that the division of labor affects 
education in much the same way as it affects all other depart: 
human activity: that there is no more need of having as a persona 
sion all the knowledge we need for guidance, than for owning 
agencies we need for locomotion or communication. (P.)
-P-A-G-E-129
THE RENAISSANCE. tor 
Montaigne simply demands that ‘‘one taste the upper 
crust of the sciences”’; that one skim over them without 
going into them deeply, ‘‘ in French fashion.” In his view, 
a well-made head is worth more than a head well filled. It 
is not. so much to accumulate, to amass, knowledge, as to - 
assimilate as much of it as a prudent intelligence can digest 
without fatigue. In a word, while Rabelais sits down, so to 
speak, at the banquet of knowledge with an avidity which 
recalls the glattony of the Pantagruelian repasts, Montaigne 
is a delicate connoisseur, who would only satisfy with dis- 
cretion a regulated appetite. 
‘112. Taz Personat Epucarion or Monrarens. — One 
often becomes teacher through recollection of his personal 
education. This is what happened to Montaigne. His ped- 
agogy is at once an imitation of the methods which a father 
full of solicitude had himself applied to him, and a protest 
against the defects and the vices of the college of Guienne, 
which he entered at the age of six years. The home 
education of Montaigne affords the interesting spectacle of 
a child who develops freely. My spirit, he himself says, was 
trained with all gentleness and freedom, without severity or 
constraint. .His father, skilful in his tender care, had him 
awakened each morning at the sound of musical instruments, 
%o as to spare him those brusque alarms that are bad pre- 
parations for toil. In a word, he applied to him that tem- 
pered discipline, at once indulgent and firm, equally removed 
from complacency and harshness, which Montaigne has 
christened with the name of severe mildness. Another char- 
acteristic of Montaigne’s education is, that he learned Latin 
38 one learns his native tongue. His father had surrounded 
him with domestics and teachers who conversed with him 
‘oily in Latin. The result of this was, that at the age of six 
he was so proficient in the language of Cicero, that the ‘best

Latinists of the time feared to address him (craignissent & 
Vaccoster). On the other hand, he knew no more of French 
than he did of Arabic.’ It is evident that Montaigne’s f-+"-~ 
had taken a false route, but at least Montaigne derived : 
.conception from this experience, namely, that the me 
ordinarily pursued in the study of the dead languages : 
slow and too mechanical; that an abuse is made of' 
and that sufficient attention is not given to practice: 
doubt but Greek and Latin are very great ornament_, 
of very great use, but we buy them too dear.”? 
At the college of Guienne, where he passed seyen years, 
Montaigne learned to detest corporal chastisements and the 
hard discipline of the scholars of his day: “ Tom

their profit is, they might have their pleasure too.”* 
118, Inorrance or A GENERAL RATHER THAN A SPECIAL 
Enucation. — If Montaigne, in different chapters of his 
essays,” has given passing attention to pedagogical questions, 
it is not only through « recollection of his own years of ap- 
prenticeship, but also because of his judgment as a philos- 
opher, that ‘‘ the greatest and most important task of human 
understanding is in those matters which concern the nurture 
and instruction of children.” . 
For him, education is the art of forming men, and not 
specialists. This he explains in his original manner under 
the form of an anecdote : 
“ Going to Orleans one day, I met in that plain this side 
Qery, two pedants who were going towards Bordeaux, 
about fifty paces distant from one another. Still further 
back of them, I saw a troop of horse, and at their head a 
gentleman who was the late Count dela Rochefoucault. One 
of my company inquired of the foremost of these dominies, 
who that gentleman was who was following him. He had 
not observed the train that was following after, and thought 
that the question related to his companion; and so he 
replied pleasantly, ‘He is not a gentleman, but a grammarian, 
and Iam a logician.’ Now, as we are here concerned in the 
training, not of a grammarian, or of a logician, but of a

104 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
complete gentleman, we will let those who will abuse their 
leisure ; but we have business of another nature.” ? 
It is true that Montaigne says gentleman, and not simply 
man; but in reality his thought is the same as that of Rous- 
seau and of all those who require a general education of the 
human soul. 
114. THe Purpose or Instruction. — From what has now 
been said, it is easy to comprehend that, in the opinion of 
Montaigne, letters and other studies are but the means or 
instrument, and not. the aim and end of instruction. The 
author of the Essays does not yield to the literary craze, 
which, in the sixteenth century, took certain scholars captive, 
and made the ideal of education to consist of a knowledge of 
the ancient languages. It is of little consequence to him 
that a pupil has learned to write in Latin; what he does 
require, is that he become better and more prudent, and have 
a sounder judgment. ‘If his soul be not put into better 
rhythm, if the judgment be not better settled, I would rather 
have him spend his time at tennis.” ? 
115. Epvcation or THE Jupement. — Montaigne has 
expressed his dominant thought on education in a hundred 
different ways. He is preoccupied with the training of the 
judgment, and on this point we might quote whole pages : 
“*, . , According to the fashion in which we are instructed, 
it is not singular that neither scholars nor masters become 
more able, although they become more wise. In fact, our 
parents devote their care and expense to furnishing our heads 
with knowledge; but to judgment and virtue no additions 
are made, Say of a passer-by to people, ‘O what a learned 
man!’ and of another, ‘O what a good man goes there!’ 
and they will not fail to turn their eyes and attention towards 
  
1 Book I. chap. xxv. 2 Book I. chap. xx1v.
-P-A-G-E-133
THE RENAISSANCE. 105 
the former. There should be a third to cry, ‘O the block- 
heads!’ Men are quick to inquire, ‘Does he know Greek 
or Latin? Does he write in verse or in prose?’ But 
whether he has become better or more prudent, which is the 
principal thing, this receives not the least notice ; whereas 
we ought to inquire who is the better learned, rather than 
who is the more learned?” 
‘¢ We labor only at filling the memory, and leave the under- 
standing and the conscience void. Just as birds sometimes 
go in quest of grain, and bring it in their bills without tasting 
it themselves, to make of it mouthfuls for their young; so 
our pedants go rummaging in books for knowledge, only to 
hold it at their tongues’ end, and then distribute it to their 
pupila.””? 
116. Srvpms Recommenpep. — The practical and utili- 
tarian mind of Montaigne dictates to him his programme of 
studies. With him it is not a question of plunging into the 
depths. of the sciences; disinterested studies are not his 
affair. If Rabelais proposed to develop the speculative 
faculties, Montaigne, on the contrary, is preoccupied with 
the practical faculties, and he makes everything subordinate 
to morals. For example, he would have history learned, not 
for the sake of knowing the facts, but of appreciating them. 
It is not so necessary to imprint in the memory of the child 
““*the date of the fall of Carthage as the character of Hanni- 
bal and Scipio, nor so much where Marcellus died as why it 
was unworthy of his duty that he died there.’’? 
And so in philosophy, it is not the general knowledge of 
man and nature that Montaigne esteems and recommends ; 
but only those parts that have a direct bearing on morals and 
active life. 
SSS 
1 Book I. chap. xxrv. 2 Book I, chap. xxv.
-P-A-G-E-134
106 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
‘<It is a pity that matters should be at such a pass as they 
are in our time, that philosophy, even with people of under- 
standing, should be looked upon as a vain and fanciful name, 
a thing of no use and no value, either for opinion or for 
action. I think that it is the love of quibbling that has 
caused things to take this turn.... Philosophy is that 
which teaches us to live.”? 
117. Epucatronan Mernops.-— An education purely 
bookish is not to Montaigne’s taste. He counts less upon 
books than upon experience and mingling with men; upon 
the observation of things, and upon the natural suggestions 
of the mind: 
‘¢For learning to judge well and speak well, whatever 
presents itself to our eyes serves as a sufficient book. The 
knavery of a page, the blunder of a servant, a table witti- 
cism, — all such things are so many new things to think 
about. And for this purpose conversation with men is 
wonderfully helpful, and so is a visit to foreign lands... 
to bring back the customs of those nations, and their man- 
ners, and to whet and sharpen our wits by rubbing them upon 
those of others.” 
“«, .. The lesson will be given, sometimes by conversation, 
sometimes by book... . Let the child examine every 
man’s talent, a peasant, a mason, a passer-by. Put into his 
head an honest curiosity in everything. Let him observe 
whatever is curious in his surroundings, —a fine house, a 
delicate fountain, an eminent man, the scene of an ancient 
battle, the routes of Czsar, or of Charlemagne. .. .”1 
Things should precede words. On this point Montaigne 
anticipates Comenius, Rousseau, and all modern educators. 
+ Book I. chap. xxv.
-P-A-G-E-135
THE RENAISSANCE. A107 
s¢Let our pupil be provided with things; words will 
follow only too fast.’?1 
“The world is given to babbling ; I hardly ever saw a man 
who did not rather prate too much, than speak too little. 
Yet the half of our life goes in that way ; we are kept four or 
five years in learning words. . . .”? 
*¢ This is not saying that it is not a fine and good thing to 
speak well; but not so good as it is made out tobe. Iam 
vexed that our life is so much occupied with all this.” 
118. How WE sHOULD READ. — Montaigne has keenly criti- 
cised the abuse of books: ‘‘I would not have this boy of 
ours imprisoned, and made a slave to his book. . . .. I would 
not have his spirit cow’d and subdu’d by applying him to the 
tack, and tormenting him, as some do, fourteen or fifteen 
hours a day, and so make a pack-horse of him. Neither 
should I think it good, when, by a solitary and melancholic 
complexion, he is discovered to be much addicted to his 
book, to nourish that humor in him, for that renders them 
unfit for civil conversation, and diverts them from better 
employments.” * 
But while he advises against excess in reading, he has 
admirably defined the manner in which we ought to read. 
Above all, he says, let us assimilate and appropriate what 
weread. Let the work of the reader resemble that of bees, 
that, on this side and on that, tap the flowers for their sweet 
  
1 Has not this extravagant preference for things, as distinguished from 
words, become ®& new superstition in educational theory? Considering the 
misuse made of words by Scholasticism, it was time for Montaigne to summon 
the attention outwards to sensible realities; but it is. more than doubtful 
whether there is any valid ground for the absolute rule of modern pedagogy, 
“fret the idea, then the term.” In actual experience, there is no invariable 
sequence. The really important thing is, that terms be made significant. (P.}

119. Mowraienu’s Errors. — Montaigne’s greate: 
must be confessed, is that he is somewhat heartless 
what of an egoist and Epicurean, he celebrates 
easy virtues that are attained ‘‘ by shady route: 
green meadows and fragrant flowers.” Hashehin..  -

‘never give, to the women of your household the care of thi

are the children the most truly our own.”? 
120. INcoMPLETENESS of HIS VIEWS ON THE EpucaTion 
or Women. — Another mental defect in Montaigne is, that, 
by reason of his moderation and conservatism, he remains a 
little narrow. High conceptions of human destiny are not 
to be expected of him; his manner of conceiving of it is 
mean and commonplace. This lack Of intellectual breadth 
is especially manifest in his reflections on the education of 
women. Montaigne is of that number, who, through false 
gallantry, would keep woman in a state of ignorance on the 
pretext that instruction would mar her natural charms. 
In their case, he would prohibit even the study of rhetoric, 
because, he says, that would ‘‘ conceal her charms under 
borrowed charms.” Women should be content with the 
advantages which their sex assures to them. With the 
knowledge which they naturally have, ‘“ they command 
with the switch, and rule both the regents and the schools.” 
However, he afterwards thinks better of it; but in his con- 
cessions there is more of contempt than in his prohibitions: 
“Tf, however, it displeases them to make us any concessions 
whatever, and they are determined, through curiosity, to 
know something of books, poetry is an amusement befitting 
their needs ; for it is 2 wanton, crafty art, disguised, all for 
pleasure, all for show, just as they are.’’? 
The following passage may also be quoted :— 
*‘ When I see them tampering with rhetoric, law, logic, 
snd the like, so improper and unnecessary for their busi- 
ness, J begin to suspect that the men who inspire them with 
such things do it that they may govern them upon that 
account.”’® a nr

110 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. * 
It is impossible to express a greater contempt for women. 
Montaigne goes so far as to deny her positive qualities of 
heart. He chances to say, with reference to Mile. de 
Gournay, his adopted daughter: ‘‘The perfection of the 
most saintly affection has been attained when it does not 
exhibit the least trace of sex.”” 
To conclude: notwithstanding some grave defects, the 
pedagogy of Montaigne is a pedagogy of good sense, and 
certain parts of it will always deserve to be admired. The 
Jansenists, and Locke, and Rousseau, in different degrees, 
draw their inspiration from Montaigne. In his own age, it 
is true, his ideas were accepted by scarcely any one save his 
disciple Charron, who, in his book of Wisdom,’ has done 
scarcely more than to arrange in order the thoughts that are 
scattered through the Hssays. But if he had no influence 
upon his own age, Montaigne has at least remained, after 
three centuries,"a sure guide in the matter of intellectual 
education. :

122. Oniern of Primary Instruction. — With La Salle 
and the foundation of the Institute of the Brethren of the 
Christian Schools, the historian of education recognizes the 
Catholic origin of primary instruction; in the decrees and 
jaws of the French Revolution, its lay and philosophical 
origin; but it is to the Protestant Reformers, —-to Luther 
in the sixteenth century, and to Comenius in the seventeenth 
—that must be ascribed the honor of having first organized 
schools for the people. In its origin, the primary school is 
the child of Protestantism, and its cradle was the Reforma- 
tion, ©

PROTESTANTISM AND PRIMARY INSTRUCTION. 3 
128. Spreir or THE Protestant Rerorm.-— The develop- 
ment of primary instruction was the logical consequence of 
the fundamental principles of the Protestant Reform. As. 
Michel Bréal has said: ‘¢ In making man responsible for his: 
own faith, and in placing the source of that faith in the Holy 
Scriptures, the Reform contracted the obligation te put each 
one in a condition to save himself by the reading and the 
understanding of the Bible.... The necessity of explain- 
ing the Catechism, and making comments on it, was for 
teachers an obligation to learn how to expound a thought, 
and. to decompose it into its elements. The study of the 
mother tongue and of singing, was associated with the reading 
of the Bible (translated into German by Luther) and with 
religious: services.” The Reform, then, contained, in germ, 
a complete-revolition in education ; it enlisted the interests 
of religion in the service of instruction, and associated 
knowledge with faith. This is the reason that, for three 
centuries, the Protestant nations have led humanity in the 
matter of primary instraction. 
124. Canvin (1509-1564), Mrzancraon (1497-1560), 
Zwinext. (1484-1532).— However, all the Protestaiit Re- 
formers were far from exhibiting the same zeal in behalf of 
primary instruction. Calvin, absorbed in religious struggles 
and polemics, was not occupied with the organization of 
schools till towards the close of his life, and even the college 
that he founded at Geneva, in 1559, was scarcely more than 
aschool for the study. of Latin. Melancthon, who has been 
called ‘the preceptor of Germany,” worked more for high 
schools than for schools for the people. He was above all 
else a professor of Belles-Lettres ; and it was with chagrin 
that he saw his courses in the University of Wittenberg de- 
serted by students when he lectured on the Olynthiacs of

Demosthenes. Before Calvin and Melancthon, the Swi 
reformer Zwingli had shown his great interest in prim: 
teaching, in his little book ‘‘ upon the manner of instructi 
and bringing up boys in a Christian way” (1524). In tl 
he recommended natural history, arithmetic, and al 
cises in fencing, in order to furnish the country wit 
defenders. 
125, Luraer (1483-1546). The German reformer Luth 
is, of all his co-religionists, the one who has served the: 
of elementary instruction with the most ardor. He no 
addressed a pressing appeal to the ruling classes in beau 
founding schools for the people, but, by his influence 
ods of instruction were improved, and the educationa 
‘was renewed in accordance with the principles of Protwovsu. 
ism. ‘ Spontaneity,” it has been said, not without som 
exaggeration, ‘‘ free thought, and free inquiry, are tl 
of Protestantism; where it has reigned, there have | 
peared the method of repeating and of learning by uea 
without reflection, mechanism, subjection to authority, th 
paralysis of the intelligence oppressed by dogmatic instrac 
tion, and science put in tutelage by the beliefs of th 
Church.”? * . 
126. APPEAL ADDRESSED To THE Macisrratss aND Lecis 
LaToRS OF Germany. —In 1524, Luther, in a special docu 
ment addressed to the public authorities of Germany, forcibl 
expressed himself against the neglect into which the interest 
of instruction had fallen. This appeal has this characteristic 
that the great reformer, while assuming that the Church i 
the mother of the school, seems especially to count on th 
secular arm, upon the power of the people, to serve his pw

poses in the cause of universal instruction.. ‘Exch city,” 
he said, ‘‘is subjected to great expense every year for the 
construction of roads, for fortifying its ramparts, and for 
buying arms and equipping soldiers. Why should it not 
spend an equal sum for the support of one or two school- 
masters? The prosperity of a city does not depend solely 
on its natural riches, on the solidity of its walls, on the ele- 
gance of its mansions, and on the abundance of arms in its 
arsenals ; but the safety and strength of a city reside above 
all in a good education, which furnishes it with instructed, 
reasonable, honorable, and well-trained citizens.” ? 
127. Dovsre Ururry or Insrruction. — A remarkable 
fact about Luthér is, that as a preacher of instruction, he does 
not speak merely from the religious point of view. After 
having recommended schools as institutions auxiliary to the 
Church, he makes a resolute argument from the human point 
of view. ‘‘ Were there neither soul, heaven, nor hell,” he 
says, ‘it would still be necessary to have schools for the sake 
of affairs here below, as the history of the Greeks and the 
Romans plainly teaches. The world has need of educated 
men and women, to the end that the men may govern the 
country properly, and that the women may properly bring up 
their children, care for their domesties, and direct the affairs 
of their households.” 
128, Necessrry or Pusiic Insrauction. —'The objection 
will perhaps be made, says Luther, that for the education of 
  
1 Luther's argument for compulsion should not be omitted: “It is my opinion that the duthorities are bound to force their subjects to send their 
children to school.... If they can oblige their able-bodied subjects to 
tarry the lance and the arquebuse, to mount the ramparts, and to do com- 
vlete military service, for @ mich better reason may they, and ought they, 
‘0 force their subjects to send their children to school, for here it is the 
Qwstion of a much more'terrible war with the devil.’? (P.)

who attend them. ‘‘ We find people,” he says, ‘‘ who serve 
God in strange ways. They fast and wear coarse clothing, 
but they pass blindly by the true divine service of the home, 
——they do not know how to bring up their children. ... 
Believe me, it is much more necessary to give attention to 
your children and to provide for their education than to pur- 
chase indulgeneies, to visit foreign churches, or to make sol- 
emn vows. ... All people, especially the Jews, oblige their 
children to go to school more than Christians do. This is 
why the state of Christianity is so low, for all its force and 
power are in the rising generation; and if these are neg- 
lected, there will be Christian churches like a garden that has 
been neglected in the spring-time.... Every day children 
are born and are growing up, and, unfortunately, no. one 
cares for the poor young people, no one thinks tg train them;

to see a lad study in twenty years and more only just enough 
bad Latin to enable him to become a priest, and to go to 
mass? And he who attained to this was counted a very 
happy being! Right happy the mother who bore. such a 
child!.’ And he has remained all his life a poor unlettered 
man. Everywhere we have seen such teachers and masters, 
who knew nothing themselves and could teach nothing that 
was good and useful; they did not even know how to learn 
and to teach. Has anything else been Jearned up to this 
time in the high schools and in the convents except to 
become asses and blockheads?...” 
130. Orcanization or THE New Scuoors. —So Luther 
resolves on the organization of new schools. The cost of 
their maintenance he makes a charge on the public treasury ; 
he demonstrates .to parents the moral obligation to have their 
children instructed in them; to the duty of conscience he 
adds civil obligation; and, finally, he gives his thought to 
the means of recruiting the teaching service. ‘Since the 
greatest evil in every place is the lack of teachers, we must - 
not wait till they come forward of themselves; we must take 
the trouble to educate them and prepare them.” To this end 
Luther keeps the best of the pupils, boys and girls, for a 
longer time in school; gives them special instructors, and 
opens libraries for their use. In his thought he never dis- 
tinguishes women teachers from men teachers; he wants 
schools for girls as well as for boys. Only, not to burden 
parents and divert children from their daily labor, he re- 
quires but little time for school duties. “You ask: Is it 
possiblé to get along without our children, and bring them up 
like gentlemen? Is it not necessary that they work at 
home? :I.reply: I by no means approve of those schools 
where a child was accustomed to pass twenty or thirty years

in studying Donatus or Alexander! without learning any- 
thing. Another world has dawned, in which things go 
differently. My opinion is that we must send the boys te 
school one or two hours a day, and have them learn a trade 
at home for the rest of the time. It is desirable that these 
two occupations march side by side. As it now is, children 
certainly spend twice as much time in playing ball, running 
the streets, and playing truant. And so the girls can 
equally well devote nearly the same time to school; without 
neglecting their home duties; they lose more time than this 
in over-sleeping and in dancing more than is meet.” 
131. Programme or Srupres. — Luther gives the first 
place to the teaching of religion: ‘Is it not reasonable that 
every Christian should know the Gospel at the age of nine 
or ten?” 
' Then come the languages, not, as might be hoped, the 
. mother tongue, but the learned languages, Latin, Greek, and 
Hebrew. Luther had not yet been sufficiently rid of the old 
spirit to comprehend that the language of the people ought 
to be the basis of universal instruction. He left to Comenius 
the glory of making the final separation of the primary 
school from the Latin school. But yet, Luther gave excel- 
lent advice for the study of languages, which must be 
learned, he said, less in the abstract rules of grammar than 
in their concrete reality. 
Luther recommends the mathematics, and also the study 
of nature ; but he has a partiality for history and historians, 
  
1 Names for treatises on grammar and philosophy respectively. Donatus 
was a celebrated grammarian and rhetorician who taught at Rome in the 
middle of the fourth century a.p.; and Alexander, a celebrated Greek com- 
mentator on the writings of Aristotle, who taught the Peripatetic philoso 
phy at Athens in the end of the second and the beginning of the third cen 
turies A.D, (P.)

_ PROTESTANTISM AND PRIMARY INSTRUCTION. 119 
who are, he says, ‘‘the best people and the best teachers,” 
on the condition that they do not tamper with the truth, and 
that “they do not make obscure the work of God.” 
Of the liberal arts of the Middle Age, Luther does not 
make much account. He rightly says of dialectics, that it is 
no equivalent for real knowledge, and that it is simply “ an 
instrument by which we render to ourselves an account of 
what we know.” 
Physical exercises are not forgotten in Luther’s peda- 
gogical regulations. But he attaches an especial importance 
to singing. ‘+ Unless a schoolmaster know how to sing, I 
think him of no account.” ‘‘ Music,” he says again, ‘is a 
half discipline which makes men more indulgent and more 
mild.” 
182. Procress 1s Mernops. — At the same time that he 
extends the programme of studies, Luther introduces a new 
spirit into methods. . He wishes uiore liberty and more’ joy 
in the school. 
‘* Solomon,” he says, “‘ is a truly royal schoolmaster. He 
does not, like the monks, forbid the young to go into the 
world and be happy. Even as Anselm said: ‘A young man 
turned aside from the world is like a young tree made to 
grow in a vase.’ The monks have imprisoned young men 
like birds.in their cage. It is dangerous to isolate the young. 
It is necessary, on the contrary, to allow young people to 
hear, see, and learn all sorts of things, while all the time 
observing the restraints and the rules of honor. Enjoyment 
and recreation are as necessary for children as food and 
drink. The schools till now were veritable prisons and hells, 
and the schoolmaster a tyrant. . . . A child intimidated by 
bad treatment is irresolute in all he does. He who has trem- 
bled before his parents will tremble all his life at the sound 
of a leaf which rustles in the wind.” 4
-P-A-G-E-148
  420 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
These quotations will suffice to make appreciated the large 
and liberal spirit of Luther, and the range of his thought as 
an educator. No one has more extolled the office of the 
teacher, of which he said, when comparing it to preaching, 
it is the work of all others the noblest, the most useful, and 
the best; ‘and yet,” he added, ‘‘I do not know which of 
these two professions is the better.” 
Do not let ourselves imagine, however, that Luther at once 
exercised a decisive influence on the current education of his 
day. A few schools were founded, called writing schools; 
but the Thirty Years’ War, and other events, interrupted the 
movement of which Luther has the honor of having been the 
originator. 
133. Tue States Generar or OrLeans (1560).— While 
in Germany, under the impulse of Luther, primary schools 
began to be established, France remained in the background. 
Let us note, however, the desires expressed by the States 
General of Orleans, in 1560: — 
*¢ May it please the king,” ‘it was said in the memorial of 
the tiobility, ‘to levy a contribution upon the church reve- 
tues for the réasonable support of teachers and men of 
learning in every city and village, for the instruction of 
the needy youth of the country; and let all parents be 
required, under penalty of a fine, to send their children 
to schoo], and let them be constrained to observe this law by 
the lords and the ordinary magistrates.” 
It was demanded, in addition, that public lectures be 
given on the Sacred Scriptures in intelligible language, that is, 
in the mother tongue. But these demands, so earnest and 
democratic, of the Protestant nobility of sixteenth century 
France, were not regarded. With the fall of Protestantism, 
the cause of primary instruction in France was doomed to a 
Jong eclipse. The nobles of the seventeenth and eighteenth
-P-A-G-E-149

centaries ‘did not think of petitioning again for the education 
of the people, and Diderot could truthfully say of them: 
‘*The nobility complain of the farm laborers who know how 
to read. Perhaps the chief grievance of the nobility reduces 
itself to this: that a peasant who knows how to read is more 
difficult to oppress than another.” 
184. Razicu (1571-1635).— In the first half of the 
seventeenth century, Ratich, a German, and Comenius, a 
Slave, were, with very different degrees of merit, the heirs 
of the educational thought of Luther. 
With something of the charlatan and the demagogue, 
Ratich devoted his life to propagating a novel art of teaching, 
which he called didactics, and to which he attributed marvels. 
He pretended, by his method of languages, to teach Hebrew, 
Greek, and Latin,in six months. But nevertheless, out of 
many strange performances and lofty promises, there issue 
some thoughts of practical value. The first merit of Ratich 
was to give the mother tongue, the German language, the 
precedence over the ancient languages. An English eduea- 
tional writer, Mr. R. H. Quick, in his Essays on Educational 
Reformers (1874), has thus summed up the essential princi- 
ples of the pedagogy of Ratich: 1. Everything should be 
taught in its own time and order, and according to the natural 
method, iu passing from the more easy to the more difficult. 
2. Only one thing should be learned at atime. ‘* We do not 
cook at the same time in one pot, soup, meat, fish, milk, and 
vegetables.” 8. The same thing should be repeated several 
times. 4. By means of these frequent repetitions, the pupil 
will have nothing to learn by heart. 5. All school-books 
should be written on the same plan. 6. The thing as a whole 
should be made known before the thing in its details, and 
the sequence should be from the general to the special. 
1. In every case we should proceed by induction and experi-
-P-A-G-E-150
122 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
ment. Ratich especially means by this that we must make 
an end of mere authority, and of the testimony of the 
ancients, and must appeal to individual reason. 8. Finally, 
everything should be learned without coercion. Coercion and 
the rod. are contrary to nature, and disgust the young with 
study. The human understanding learns with pleasure ali 
that it ought to retain. It does not seem that Ratich knew 
how to draw from these principles, which, by the way, are 
not true save under certain corrections, all the happy results 
that are contained in them: He left to Comenius the glory 
of applying the new spirit to actual practice. 
135. Comentus (1592~1671).— For a long time unknown 
and unappreciated, Comenius has finally received from our 
contemporaries the admiration that is due him. Michelet 
speaks of him with enthusiasm as ‘that rare genius, that 
gentle, fertile, universal scholar”; and he calls him the 
first evangelist of modern pedagogy, Pestalozzi being the 
second. It is easy to justify this appreciation. ‘The char- 
acter of Comenius equals his intelligence. Through a thou- 
sand obstacles he devoted his long life to the work of popular 
instruction. With a generous ardor he consecrated himself 
to infancy. He wrote twenty works and taught in twenty 
cities. Moreover, he was the first to form a definite concep- 
tion of what the elementary studies should be. He deter- 
mined, nearly three hundred years ago, with an exactness 
that leaves nothing to be desired, the division of the dif- 
ferent grades of instruction. He exactly defined some of 
the essential laws of the art of teaching. He applied to 
pedagogy, with remarkable insight, the principles of modern 
logic. Finally, as Michelet has said, he was the Galileo, we 
would rather say, the Bacon, of modern education. 
  1 Michelet, Nos fils, p. 175 et seq.

PROTESTANTISM AND PRIMARY INSTRUCTION. 123 
136. -Bacontay Inspiration. — The special aims of peda- 
gogy are essentially related to the general aims of science. 
All progress in science has its corresponding effects on edu- 
cation, When an innovator has modified the laws for the 
discovery of truth, other innovators appear, who modify, in 
their turn, the rules for instruction. To a new logic almost 
necessarily corresponds a new pedagogy. 
Now Bacon, at the opening of the seventeenth century, 
had opened unknown routes to scientific investigation. For 
the abstract processes of thought, for the barren comparison 
of propositions and words, in which the whole art of the 
syllogism consisted, the author of the Novum Organum had 
substituted the. concrete study of reality, the living and 
fruitful observation of nature. The mechanism. of deduc- 
tive reasoning was replaced by the slow and patient inter- 
pretation of facts. It no longer answered to analyze with 
docile spirit principles that were assumed, right or wrong, as 
absolute truths ; nor to become expert in handling the syllo- 
gism, which, like a mill running dry, often prodaced but 
little four. It was now necessary to open the eyes to the 
contemplation of the universe, and by sense intuition, by 
observation, by experiment, and by induction, to penetrate 
its secrets, and determine its laws. It was necessary to 
ascend, step by step, from the knowledge of the simplest 
things to the discovery of the most. general laws; and, 
finally, to demand of nature herself to reveal all that the 
human intelligence, in its solitary meditations, is powerless 
to discover. — 
Looking at this subject more closely, this revolution in 
science, so important from the point of view of speculative’ 
inquiry, and destined to change the aspect of the sciences, 
also contained in itself a revolution in education. For this 
purpose, all that was needed was to apply to the develop
-P-A-G-E-152
124 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
ment of the intelligence and to the communication of knowl- 
edge the rules proposed by Bacon for the investigation’ of 
truth. The laws of scientific induction might become the 
laws for the education of the soul. No more setting out 
with abstract ptinciples, imposed by authority; but facts 
intuitively apprehended, gathered by observation and veri- 
fied by experiment; the order of nature faithfully followed ; 
a cautious progression from the simplest and most elemen- 
tary ideas to the most difficult and most complex truths; 
the knowledge of things instead of an analysis of words, — 
such was to be the character of the new system of instruc- 
, tion. In other terms, it was possible to make the child fol- 
‘low, in order to lead him to know and to comprehend the 
capitalized truths that constitute the basis of elementary 
instruction, the same method that Bacon recommended to 
scholars for the discovery of unknown truths.1 
It is this conversion, or, as we might say, this translation, 
of the maxims of the Baconian logic into pedagogical rules, 
that Comenius attempted, and this is why he has been called 
‘the father of the intuitive method.” He was nourished, 
intellectually, by the reading of Bacon, whom he resembles, 
not only in his ideas, but also in his figurative and often 
allegorical language. Even the title of one of his books, 
Didactica Magna, recalls the title of Bacon’s Jnstauratio 
Magna. : 
1 This is, perhaps, the earliest appearance of the conception that learn- 
ing should be a process of discovery or of re-discovery. Condillac (1715- 
1780) has elaborated this idea in the introduction to his Grammaire, and 
Spencer (Education, p. 122) makes it a fundamental law of teaching. If 
this assumed principle were to be rigorously applied, as, fortunately, it 
cannot be, progress in human knowledge would be impossible. Mr. Bain’s 
tomment on this doctrine (Education as a Science, p. 94) is as follows: 
“This bold fiction is sometimes put forward as one of the regular arts of 
the teacher ; but I should prefer to consider it as an extraordinary device, 
admissible only on special occasions.” (P.)

i 187. Tas Live or Comemws.—-To know Comenius and 
the part he played in the seventeenth century, to appreciate 
this’ grand educational character, it would be necessary to 
begin by relating his life; his misfortunes; his journeys to 
England, where Parliament invoked his aid; to Sweden, 
where the Chancellor Oxenstiern employed him to write 
manuals of instruction ; especially his relentless industry, his 
courage through exile, and the long persecutions he suffered 
as a member of the sect of dissenters, the Moravian Breth- 
ren; and the-schools he founded at Fulneck,-in Bohemia, at 
Lissa and at Patak, in Poland. But it would require too 
much of our space to follow in its incidents and catastro- 
phes that troubled life, which, in its sudden trials, ‘as in the 
firmness that supported them, recalls the life of Pestalozzi.* 
138. His Pricreat ‘Works. — Comenius wrote a large 
number of books in Latin, in German, and in Czechs. but 
of these only a few are worthy to engage the attention of 
the educator.. In his other works he allows himself to go off 
ou philosophic excursions, and to indulge in mystic reveries, 
led by his ardor to find what he called pansophia, wisdom or 
universal knowledge. In this wilderness of publications 
destined to oblivion, we shall notice only three works, which 
  13t may not be generally known that Comenius was once solicited to 
become the President of Harvard College. The following is a quotation 
from Vol. IL, p. 14, of Cotton Mather’s Magnalia: “That brave old man, 
Johannes Amos Commenius, the fame of whose worth hath been érumpetted 
as far as more than three languages (whereof every one is indebted unto 
his Janua) could carry it, was indeed agreed withal, by our Mr. Winthrop 
in his travels through the low countries, to come over into New England, 
and ilinminate this Colledge and country, in the quality of a President, 
which was now becotié vacant. But the solicitations of the Swedish Am- 
bassador diverting him another way, that incomparable Moravian became 
not-an American.” This was on the resignation of President Dunster, in 
164, .) .

126. THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
contain the general principles of the pedagogy of Comenius, 
and the applications which he has made of his method :— 
1. The Didactica Magna, the Great Didactics (written in 
Czech at about 1630, and rewritten in Latin at about 
1640). In this work Comenius sets forth his principles, 
his general theories on education, and also his peculiar 
views on the practical organization of schools. It is to be 
regretted that a French translation has not yet popularized 
this important book, that would be worthy a place beside the 
Thoughts of Locke and the Emile of Rousseau.’ 
2. The Janua linguarum reserata, the Gate of Tongues 
Unlocked (1631). In the thought of the author, this was 
a new method of learning the languages. Comenius, led 
astray on this point by his religious prejudices, wished to 
banish the Latin authors from the schools, ‘‘ for the pur- 
pose,” he said, ‘‘of reforming studies in the true spirit of 
Christianity.” Consequently, in order to replace the clas- 
sical authors, which he repudiated for this further reason, 
that the reading of them is too difficult, and to make a child 
study them “is to wish to push out into the vast ocean a 
tiny. bark that should be allowed only to sport on a little 
lake,” he had formed the idea of composing a collection of 
phrases distributed into a hundred chapters. These phrases, 
to the number of a thousand, at first very simple, and of 
single member, then longer and-more complicated, were 
formed of two thousand words, chosen from among the most 
common and the most useful. Moreover, the hundred chapters 
of the Janua taught the child, in succession and in a methodi- 
cal order, all the things in the universe, — the elements, the 
metals, the stars, the animals, the organs of the body, the arts

is, ‘John Amos Comenius,” by S, 8. Laurie (Boston: 1885). It is an in 
valuable contribution to the philosophy and the history of education. (P.)

and trades, etc., etc. In other terms, the Janua linguarum 
is a nomenclature of ideas and words designed to fix the atten- 
tion of the child upon everything he ought to know of the 
world. Divested of the Latin text that accompanies it, the 
Janua is a first reading-book, very defective doubtless, but 
it gives proof cf a determined effort to adapt to the intelli- 
gence of the child the knowledge that he ought to acquire. 
3. The Orbis sensualium pictus, the Illustrated World of 
Sensible Objects, the most popular of the author’s works 
(1658). Itis the Janua linguarum accompanied with pic- 
tures, in lieu of real objects, representing to the child the 
things that he hears spoken of, as fast as he learns their 
names, The Orbis pictus, the first practical application of 
the intuitive method, had an extraordinary success, and has 
served as a model for the innumerable illusttated books 
which for three centuries have invaded the schools. 
139. Tue Four Grapzs or Instruction. — We must not 
require a man of the seventeenth century to abjure Latin 
studies. Comenius prizes them highly; but at least he is 
wise enough to put them in their place, and does not con- 
found them, as Luther did, with elementary studies. 
Nothing could be more exact, more clearly cut, than the 
scholastic organization proposed by Comenius. We shall find in it what the experience of three centuries has finally 
sanctioned and established, the distribution of schools into 
these grades, —infant schools, primary schools, secondary 
schools, and higher schools. 
‘The first grade of instruction is the maternal school, the 
school by the mother’s knee, materni gremiz, as Comenius 
calls it. The mother is the first teacher. Up to the age of six the child is taught by her; he is initiated by her into those branches of. knowledge that he will pursue in the pri- mary school.
-P-A-G-E-160
128 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
The second grade is the elementary public school. All the 
children, girls and boys, enter here at six, and leave at 
twelve. The characteristic of this school is that the instruc- 
tion there given is in the mother tongue, and this is why 
Comenius calls it the ‘‘ common” school, vernacula, a term 
given by the Romans to the language of the people. 
The third grade is represented by the Latin school or gym- 
nasium. hither are sent the children from twelve to 
eighteen years of age for whom has been reserved a more 
complete instruction, such as we would now call secondary 
instruction. 
Finally, to the fourth grade correspond the academies, that 
is, institutions of higher instruction, opened to young men 
from eighteen to twenty-four years of age. 
The child, if he is able, will traverse these four grades in 
succession; but, in the thought of Comenius, the studies 
should be so arranged in the elementary schools, that in 
leaving them, the pupil shall have a general education which 
makes it unnecessary for him to go farther, if his condition 
in life does not destine him to pursue the courses of the Latin 
School. 
‘s We pursue,” says Comenius, ‘‘a general education, the 
teaching to all men of all the subjects of human concern. 
The purpose of the people’s school shall be that all 
children of both sexes, from the tenth to the twelfth or the 
thirteenth year, may be instructed in that knowledge which 
is useful during the whole of life.” 
_ This was an admirable definition of the purpose of the 
primary school. A thing not less remarkable is that Come- 
nius establishes an elementary school in each village : — 
“There should be a maternal school in each family; an 
elementary school in each district; a gymnasium in each 
city ; an academy in each kingdom, or even in each consid- 
erable province.”

140. Exzmenvary, Inrriarion into ALL THE STUDIES. —~ 
One of the most novel 4nd most original ideas of the great 
Slavic educator is the wish that, from the earliest years of 
his life, the child may acquire some elementary notions of all 
the sciences that he is to study at a later period. From the 
cradle, the gaze of the infant, guided by the mother, should 
be directed:to all the objects that surround him, so that his 
growing powers of reflection will be brought into play in 
working on these sense intuitions. ‘Thus, from the mo- 
ment he begins to speak, the child comes to know himself, and, 
by his daily experience, certain general and abstract expres- 
sions; he comes to comprehend the meaning of the words 
something, nothing, thus, otherwise, where, similar, different ; 
and what are generalizations and the categories expressed by 
these words but the rudiments of metaphysics? In the do- 
main of physics, the infant can learn to know water, earth, 
air, fire, rain, snow, etc., as well as the names and uses of the 
parts of his body, or at least of the external members and 
organs. He will take his first lesson in optics in learning to 
distinguish light, darkness, and the different colors; and in 
astronomy, in- noticing the sun, the moon, and the stars, and 
in observing that these heavenly bodies rise and set every 
day. In geography, according to the place where he lives, 
he will be shown a mountain, a valley, a plain, a river, a 
village, a hamlet, a city, etc. In chronology, he will be 
taught what an hour is, a day, a week, a year, summer, win- 
ter, yesterday, the day before yesterday, to-morrow, the day 
after to-morrow, etc. History, such as his age will allow him 
to conceive, will consist in recalling what has recently passed, 
in taking account of it, and in noting the part that this one or 
that has taken in such or such an affair. Arithmetic, geom- 
etry, statistics, mechanics, will not remain strangers to him. 
He will acquire the elements of these sciences in distinguishing

130 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
the difference between little and much, in learning to count up 
to ten, in observing that three is more thin two; that one 
added to three makes four; in learning the sense of the 
words great and small, long and short, wide and narrow, 
heavy and light; in drawing lines, curves, circles, etc. ; in 
seeing goods measured with a yard-stick; in weighing an 
object in a balance; in trying to make something or to take it 
to pieces, as all children love to do. 
‘In this impulse to construct and destroy, there is but the 
effort of the little intelligence to succeed in making or build- 
ing something for himself; so that, instead of opposing the 
child in this, he should be encouraged and guided.” 
‘¢ The grammar of the first period will consist in le: 
to pronounce the mother tongue correctly.. The chilc 
receive elementary notions even of politics, in obs:_.-_. 
that certain persons assemble at the city hall, and that they 
are called councillors; and that among these persons there 
is one called mayor, etc.”* 
141. Tue Propie’s ScHoor. — Divided into six classes, 
the people’s school should prepare the child either for active 
life or for the higher courses. Comeniiis sends here not 
only the sons of peasants and workmen, but the sons of the 
middle class or of the nobility, who will aftervi

poned the study of Latin till the sixth year, and which till 
then keep the pupil upon the subjects of primary instruction, 
—what are they but the distant echo of the thought of Come- 
nius? Let it be noted, too, that the plan of Comenius gave 
to its primary school a complete encyclopedic course of 
instruction, which was sufficient for its own ends, but which, 
while remaining-elementary, was a whole, and not a begin- 
ning? 
Surely, the programme of studies devised by Comenius 
did not fail in point of insufficiency ; we may be allowed, on 
the contrary, to pronounce it too extended, too crowded, 
conformed rather to the generous dreams of an innovator than | 
to a pradent appreciation of what is practically possible ; 
and we need not be astonished that, to lighten in part the 
heavy burden that is imposed on the teacher, Comenius had 
the notion of dividing the school into sections which assist- 
ants, chosen from among the best pupils, should instruct 
under the supervision of the master.

142. Sire or sue Scuoor.—One is not a complete 
educator save on the condition of providing for the exterior 
and material organization of the school, as well as for its 
moral administration. In this respect, Comenius is still 
deserving of our encomiums. He requires a yard for recre-

grade. . 
2The public school of the European type may be represented by a series 
of (3) pyramids, the second higher than the first, and the third higher than 
the second, each independent and complete in itself; while the public school 
of the American type is represented by a single pyramid in three sections. 
While in an English, French, or German town, public education is admin- 
istered in three separate establishments, in an American town there is a 
single graded school that fulfills the same functions. (P.)

132 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
ation, and demands that the school-house have a gay and 
cheerful aspect.- The question had been discussed before 
him by Vives (1492-1540). 
‘‘There should be chosen,” says the Spanish educator, 
‘a healthful situation, so that the pupils may not one day 
have to take their flight, dispersed by the fear of an epi- 
demic. Firm health is necessary to those who would heartily 
and profitably apply themselves to the study of the sciences. 
And the place selected should be isolated from the crowd, 
and especially at a distance from occupations that are 
‘noisy, such as those of smiths, stone-masons, machinists, 
wheelwrights, and weavers. However, I would not have the 
Situation too cheerful and attractive, lest it might suggest te 
the scholars the taking of too frequent walks.” 
But these considerations that do honor to Vives and to 
Comenius, were scarcely in harmony with the resources then 
at the disposal of the friends of instruction. There was 
scarcely occasion seriously to consider how school-houses 
should be constructed and situated, at a period when the 
most often there were no school-houses existing. ‘‘ In win- 
ter,” says Platter, ‘we slept in the school-room, and in 
summer in the open air.”? 
148. Sensz Inrorrions. —If Comenius has traced with 4 
master hand the general organization of the primary school, 
he has no less merit in the matter of methods. 
‘When they recommend the observation of sensible things 
as the first intellectual exercise, modern educators do but 
repeat what Comenius said three centuries ago. 
‘In the place of dead books, why should we not open the 
living book of nature?... To instruct the young is not te 
beat into them by repetition a mass of words, phrases, sen-

tences, and opinions gathered out of authors; but it is. te 
open their understanding through things. .. . 
“The foundation of all knowledge consists in.correctly rep- 
resenting sensible objects to our senses, so that they can be 
comprehended with facility. I hold that this is the basis of all 
our other activities, since we could neither act nor speak wisely 
unless we adequately comprehended what we were to do and 
say. Now it is certain that there is nothing in the under- 
standing that was not first in the senses, and, consequently, 
it is to lay the foundation of all wisdom, of all eloquence, 
and of all good and prudent conduct, carefully to train the 
senses to note with accuracy the differences between natural 
objects; and as this point, important as it is, is ordinarily 
neglected in the schools of to-day, and as objects are pro- 
posed to scholars that they do not understand because they 
have not been properly represented to their senses or to their 
imagination, it is for this reason, on the one hand, that the 
toil of teaching, and on the other, that the pain of learning, 
have become so burdensome and so unfruitful. .. . 
“We must offer to the young, not the shadows of things, 
but the things themselves, which impress the senses and 
the imagination. Instruction should commence with a real 
observation of things, and not with a verbal description of 
them.” 
We see that Comenius accepts the doctrine of Bacon, 
even to his’ absolute sensationalism. In his pre-occupation 
with the importance of instruction through the senses, he 
goes so fur as to ignore that other source of knowledge and 
intuitions, the inner consciousness. 
144. Smmetirication or Grammatical Sroupy. — The first 
result of the experimental method applied to instruction, is 
to simplify grammar and to relieve it from the abuse of ab-

stract rules. ‘‘ Children,” says Comenius, ‘‘ need examples 
and things which they can see, and not abstract rules.”’ 
And in the Preface of the Janua linguarum, he dwells 
upon the faults of the old method employed for the study 
of languages. 
‘Tt is a thing self-evident, that the true and proper way of 
teaching ‘languages has not been recognized in the schools 
up to the present time: The most of those who devoted 
themselves to the study of letters grew old in the study of 
words, and upwards of ten years was spent in the study of 
Latin alone; indeed, they even spent their whole life in the 
study, with a very slow and very trifling profit, which did not 
pay for the trouble devoted to it.”* It is by use and by read- 
ing that Comenius would abolish the abuse of rules. Rules 
ought to intervene only to aid use and give it surety. The 
pupil will thus learn language, either in speaking, or in read- 
ing a book like the Orbis Pictus, in which he will find at the 
same time all the words of which the language itself is com- 
posed, and examples of all the constructions of its syntax. 
145. Necessiry or Driz anp Practice. — Another 
essential point in the new method, is the importance .at- 
tributed by Comenius to practical exercises: ‘‘ Artisans,’’ he 
said, ‘understand this matter perfectly well. Not one of 
them will give an apprentice a theoretical course on his trade. 
He is allowed to notice what is done by his master, and then 
the tool is put in his hands: it is in smiting that one becomes 
a smith.” ?

of the Janua linguarum, a French edition of which (if three languages:

It is no longer the thing to repeat mechanically a lesson 
learned by heart. There must be a gradual habituation to 
action, to productive work, to personal effort. 
146. GenzraL Breartinc or tHe Work or Comentus. — 
How many other new and judicious ideas we shall have to 
gather from Comenius! The methods which we would be 
tempted to consider as wholly recent, his imagination had 
already suggested to him. For example, preceding the Orbis 
Pictus, we find an alphabet, where to each letter corresponds 
the ery of an animal, or else a sound familiar to the child. 
Is not this already the very essence of the phononimic pro- 
cesses* brought into fashion in these last years? But what 
is of more consequence with Comenius than a few happy dis- 
coveries in practical pedagogy, is the general inspiration of 
his work. He gives to education a psychological basis in 
demanding that the faculties shall be developed in their natu- 
ral order: first, the senses, the memory, the imagination, and 
lastly the judgment and the reason. He is mindful of physi- 
cal exercises, of technical and practical instruction, without 
forgetting that in the primary schools, which he calls the 
“gtadios of humanity,” there must be trained, not only strong 
and skilful artisans, but virtuous and religious men, imbued 
with the principles of order and justice. If he has stepped’ 
from theology to pedagogy, and if he permits himself some- 
times to be borne along by his artless bursts of mysticism, at 
least he does not forget the necessities of the real condition, 
  
like carpentry? Should a physician and a blacksmith be educated on the 
same plan? In every case knowledge should precede practice; and the 
liberal arts are best learned by first learning their correlative sciences. (P.)

of human speech thirty-three onomatopoctic gestures, which recall to the

and of the present life of men. ‘The child,” he says, ‘¢ shall 
learn only what is to be useful to him in this life or in the 
other.” Finally, he does not allow himself to be absorbed in 
the minute details of school management. He has higher 
views, he is working for the regeneration of humanity. 
Like Leibnitz, he would freely say: ‘(Give me for a few 
years the direction of education, and I agree to transform the 
world!” 
(147. Awarytican Summary.—1. Decisive changes in 
human opinion, political, religious, or scientific, involve cor- 
responding changes in the purposes and methods of educa- 
tion. 
2. The Reformation was a breaking with authority in mat- 
ters of religion, as the Baconian philosophy was a breaking 
with authority in matters of science ; and their joint effect on 
education was to subject matters of opinion, belief, and 
knowledge to the individual reason, experience, and observa- 
tion. 
3. In holding each human being responsible for his’ own 
salvation, the Reformation made it necessary for every one 
to read, and the logical consequence of this was to make 
instruction universal; and as schools were multiplied, the 
number of teachers. must be increased, and their grade of 
competence raised. 
4. The conception that ignorance is an evil,’and a constant 
menace to spiritual and temporal safety, led to the idea of 
compulsory school-attendance. 
5. In the recoil from the intuitions of the intellect sanc- 
tioned by Socrates, to the intuitions of the senses sanctioned 
by Bacon, education passed from an extreme dependence on 
reflection and reason, to an extreme dependence on sense and 
observation; so that inference has been thrown into dis-

eredit,, and the verdict of the senses has been made the test 
of knowledge. : 
6. In adapting the conception of universal education to 
the social conditions of his time, Comenius was led to a gra- 
dation of schools that underlies all modern systems of public 
instruction.]

and national education was embodied in the legislative acts   
1 Religious congregations, as known in France, are associations of per- 
sons who, consecrating themselves to the service of God, make a vow to 
live in common under the same rule. Many of these congregations devote 
themselves to the work of teacbing, and these are of two classes, the 
authorized and the unauthorized. For example, the ‘‘Brethren of the 
Christian Schools,” founded by La Salle, is an authorized, and the ‘‘ Society 
of Jesus’’ an unauthorized, congregation. From statistics published in 
1878, it appears that there were then in France, 24 congregations of men 
authorized to teach, and controlling 3096 establishments; and 528 similar 
congregations of women, controlling 16,478 establishments. At the same 
time there were 85 unauthorized congregations of men, and 260 unauthorized 
congregations of women, devoted to teaching. (P.)

THE TEACHING CONGREGATIONS. 139 
of our assembled rulers, education remained almost exclu- 
sively an affair of the Church. The universities themselves 
were dependent in part on religious authority. But especially 
the great congregations assumed a monopoly of the work of 
teaching, the direction and control of which the State had 
not yet claimed for her right. 
Primary instruction, it is true, scarcely entered at first into 
the settled plans of the religious orders. The only exception 
to this statement that can properly be made, is the congrega- 
tion of the Christian Doctrine, which a humble priest, Cesar 
de Bus, founded at Avignon in 1592, the avowed purpose of 
which was the religious education of the children of the com- 
pany.’ But, on the other hand, secondary instruction pro- 
voked the greatest educational event of the sixteenth century, 
the founding of the company of Jesus, and this movement 
was continued and extended in the seventeenth century, 
either in the colleges of the Jesuits, ever growing in number, 
or in other rival congregations. 
149. Jzsurrs anp JANsENIsTs. — Among the religious 
orders that have consecrated their efforts to the work of 
teaching, the first place must be assigned to the Jesuits and 
the Jansenists. Different in their statutes, their organiza- 
tion, and their destinies, these two congregations are still 
more different in their spirit. They represent, in fact, two 
opposite, and, as it were, contrary phases of human nature 
and of the Christian spirit. For the Jesuits, education is 
reduced to a superficial culture of the brilliant faculties of 
the intelligence ; while the Jansenists, on the contrary, aspire

140 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. ° 
In the colleges of the Jesuits, rhetoric is held in honor; 
while in the Little Schools of Port Royal, it is rather logic 
and the exercise of thought. The shrewd disciples of Loyola 
adapt themselves to the times, and are full of compassion for 
human weakness ; the solitaries of Port Royal are exacting 
of others and of themselves. In their suppleness and cheer- 
ful optimism, the Jesuits are almost the Epicureans of Chris- 
tianity ; with their austere and somewhat sombre doctrine, 
the Jansenists would rather be the Stoics. The Jesuits and 
the Jansenists, those great rivals of the seventeenth century, 
are still face to face as enemies at the present moment. 
While the inspiration of the Jesuits tries to maintain the old 
worn-out exercises, like Latin verse, and the abuse of the 
memory, the spirit of the Jansenists animates and inspires 
the reformers, who, in the teaching of the classics, break 
with tradition and routine, to substitute for exercises aimed 
at elegance, and for a superficial instruction, studies of a 
greater solidity and an education that is more complete. 
The merit of institutions ought not always to be measured 
by their apparent success. . The colleges of the Jesuits, dur- 
ing three centuries, have had a countless number of pupils; 
the Little Schools of Port Royal did not live twenty years, 
and during their short existence they enrolled at most only 
some hundreds of pupils. And yet the methods of the 
Jansenists have survived the ruin of their colleges and thr 
dispersion of the teachers who ‘had applied them. Although 
the Jesuits have not ceased to rule in appearance, it is the 
Jansenists who triumph in reality, and who to-day control 
the secondary instruction of France.

not an order devoted to monastic contemplation, but a real 
fighting corps, a Catholic army, whose double purpose was to 
conquer new provinces to the faith through missions, and to 
preserve the old through the control of education. Solemnly 
consecrated by the Pope Paul III., in 1540, the congregation 
had a rapid growth. _ As early as the middle of the sixteenth 
century, it had several colleges in France, particularly those 
of Billom, Mauriac, Rodez, Tournon, and Pamiers. ‘In 1561 
it secured a footing in Paris, notwithstanding the resistance 
of the Parliament, of the university, and of the bishops them- 
selves. A hundred years later it counted nearly fourteen | 
thousand pupils in the province of Paris alone. The college 
of Clermont, in 1651, enrolled more than two thonsand young 
men. The middle and higher classes assured to the colleges 
of the society an ever-increasing membership. At the end 
of the seventeenth century, the Jesuits could inscribe on the 
roll of honor of their classes a hundred illustrious names, 
among others, those of Condé and Luxembourg, Fléchier and 
Bossuet, Lamoignon and Séguier, Descartes, Corneille, and 
Molitre. In 1710 they controlled six hundred and twelve 
colleges and a large number of universities. They were the 
real masters of education, and they maintained this educational 
supremacy till the end of the eighteenth century.

Fathers taught me nothing but Latin and nonsense.” But 
from the seventeenth century, opinions are divided, and the 
encomiums of Bacon and Descartes must be offset by the 
severe judgment of Leibnitz. ‘In the matter of educa- 
tion,” says this great philosopher, ‘‘ the Jesuits have remained 
below mediocrity.”’ Directly to the contrary, Bacon had

written: ‘‘ As to whatever relates to the instruction of the 
young, we must consult the schools of the Jesuits, for there 
can be nothing that is better done.” ? 
152. Avrsorities to Consutt. — The Jesuits have never 
written anything on the principles and objects of education. 
We must not demand of them an exposition of general 
views, or a confession of. their educational faith. But to 
make amends, they have drawn up with precision, with 
almost infinite attention to details, the rules and regulations 
of their course of study. Already, in 1559, the Constitu- 
tions, probably written by Loyola himself, devoted a whole 
‘book to the organization of the colleges of the society.” But 
in particular, the Ratio Studiorum, published in 1599, con- 
tains a complete scholastic programme, which has remained 
for three centuries the invariable educational code of the 
congregation. Without doubt, the Jesuits, always ready to 
make apparent concessions to the spirit of the times, with- 
out sacrificing anything of their own spirit, and without 
renouncing their inflexible purpose, have introduced modifi- 
cations into their original rules ; but the spirit of their edu- 
cational practice has remained the same, and, in 1854, 
Beckx, the actual general of the order, could still declare 
that the Ratio is the immutable rule of Jesuit education.

on the institutions for university education; but:in no in- 
stance have they founded a primary school. Even ‘in: their 
establishments for secondary instruction, they entrust the 
lower classes to teachers who do not belong. to their order, 
and reserve. to. themselves the direction of the higher classes. 
Must we believe, as they have declared in order to explain 
this negligence, that the only reason for their reserve and 
their indifference is to be sought for in the insufficiency of 
their teaching force? No; the truth is that the Jesuits 
ueither desire nor love the instruction of the people.- To 
desire and to love this, there must be faith in conscience and - 
reason; there must be a belief in human equality. Now 
the Jesuits distrust the human intelligence, and administer 
only the aristocratic education of the ruling classes, whom 
they hope to retain under their own control. They wish to 
train amiable gentlemen, accomplished men of the world; 
they have no conception of training men. Intellectual cul- 
ture, in their view, is but a convenience, imposed on certain 
classes of the nation by their rank. It is not a good in 
itself ; if may even become an evil. In certain hands it is 
a dangerous weapon. The ignorance of a people is the best 
safeguard of its faith, and faith is the supreme end. So we 
shall not be astonished to.read this in the Constitutions : —. 
‘None of those who are employed in domestic service on ° 
account of the society, ought to learn to read and write; or, 
if they already know these arts, to learn more of them. 
They shall not be instructed without the consent of the 
General, for it suffices for them to serve with all simplicity 
and humility our Master,. Jesus Christ.”” | 
154. Crassica, Srupres: Lavy anp THE Humanities. — 
It is only in secondary instruction that the Jesuits have 
taken position with marked success. The basis of their 
teaching is the study of Latin and Greek. Their purpose is
-P-A-G-E-176
144 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
to monopolize classical studies in order to make them serve 
for the propagation of the Catholic faith. To write in Latin 
is the ideal which they propose to their pupils. The first 
consequence of this is the proscription of the mother tongue. 
Tne Ratio forbids the use of French even in conversation ; 
it permits it only on holidays. Hence, also, the importance 
accorded to Latin and Greek composition, to the explication 
of authors, and to the study of grammar, rhetoric, and 
poetry. It is to be noted, besides, that the Jesuits put 
scarcely more into the hands of their pupils than select 
extracts, expurgated editions. They wish, in some sort, to 
efface from the ancient books whatever marks the epoch and 
characterizes the time. They detach fine passages, of elo- 
quence and beautiful extracts of poetry ; but they are afraid, 
it seems, of the authors themselves; they fear lest the pupil 
find in them the old human spirit, — the spirit of nature. 
Moreover, in the explication of authors, they pay more 
attention to words than to things. They direct the pupil’s 
attention, not to the thoughts, but to the elegancies of lan- 
guage, to the elocutionary effect; in a word, to the form, 
which, at least, has no religious character, and can in no- 
wise give umbrage to Catholic orthodoxy. They fear to 
awaken. reflection and individual judgment. As Macaulay 
has said, they seem to have found the point up to which 
intellectual culture can be pushed without reaching intellec- 
tual emancipation. 
155. Disparmn or History, or PaiLosorHy, AND OF THE 
Scrences im GENERAL. — Preoccupied before all else with 
purely formal studiés, and exclusively devoted to the exer- 
cises which give a training in the use of elegant language, 
the Jesuits leave real and concrete studies in entire neglect. 
History is almost wholly banished from their programme. 
It is only with reference to the Greek and Latin texts that
-P-A-G-E-177
THE TEACHING CONGREGATIONS, 145 
the teacher should make allusion to the matters of history 
which are necessary for the understanding of the passage 
under examination. No account is made of modern history, 
nor of the history of France. ‘‘ History,” says a Jesuit 
Father, ‘‘is the destruction of him who studies it.” This 
systematic omission of historical studies suffices to put in its 
trae light the artificial and superficial pedagogy of the 
Jesuits, admirably defined by Beckx, who expresses himself 
thus :— 
‘“‘The gymnasia will remain what they are by nature, a 
gymnastic for the intellect, which consists far less in the 
assimilation of real matter, in the acquisition of different 
knowledges, than in a culture of pure form.” 
The sciences and philosophy are involved in the same dis- 
dain as history.. Scientific studies are entirely proscribed in 
the lower classes, and the student enters his year in philoso- 
phy,’ having studied only the ancient languages. Philosophy 
itself is reduced to a barren study of words, to subtile dis- 
cussions, and to commentaries on Aristotle. Memory and 
syllogistic reasoning are the only faculties called into play ; 
no facts, no real inductions, no care for the observation of 
nature. In all things the Jesuits are the enemies of prog- 
ress. Intolerant of everything new, they would arrest the 
progress of the human mind and make it immovable. 
156. Discrptine. — Extravagant statements have been 
made relative to the reforms in discipline introduced by the 
Jesuits into their educational establishments. The fact is, 
that they have caused to prevail in their colleges more of 
order and of system than there was in the establishments of 
the University. On the other hand, they have attempted to 
please their pupils, to gild for them, so to speak, the bars of.

146 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
the prison which confined them. Theatrical representations, 
excursions on holidays, practice in swimming, riding, and 
fencing, nothing was neglected that could render their 
residence at school endurable. 
But, on the other hand, the Jesuits have incurred the 
grave fault of detaching the child from the family. They 
wish to have absolute control of him. The ideal of the per- 
fect scholar is to forget his parents. Here is what was said 
by a pupil of the Jesuits, who afterwards became a member 
of. the Order, J. B. de Schultaus : — 
‘‘His mother paid him a visit at the College of Trent. 
He refused to take her hand, and would not even raise his 
eyes to hers. The mother, astonished and grieved, asked 
her son the cause of such a cold greeting. ‘I refuse to 
notice you,’ said the pupil, ‘not because you are my mother, 
but because you are a woman.’ And the biographer adds: 
‘This was not excessive precaution; woman preserves 
to-day the faults she had at the time of our first father; it 
is always she who drives man from Paradise.” When the 
mother of Schultaus died, he did not show the least emotion, 
having long ago adopted the Holy Virgin for his true 
mother.” 
157. Emvation Encovracep. — The Jesuits have always 
considered emulation as one of the essential elements of dis- 
cipline. ‘‘It is necessary,” says the Ratio, ‘to encourage 
an honorable emulation; it is a great stimulus to study. 
Superior on this point, perhaps on this alone, to the Jansen- 
ists, who through mistrust of human nature feared to excite 
pride by encouraging emulation, the Jesuits have always 
counted upon the self-love of the pupil. The Ratio mul- 
tiplies rewards,— solemn distributions of prizes, crosses, 
ribbons, decorations, titles borrowed from the Roman 
Republic, such as decurions and pretors; all means, even.
-P-A-G-E-179

the most puerile, were invented to nourish in pupils an ardor 
for work, and to incite them to surpass one another. Let 
us add that the pupil was rewarded, not only for his own. 
good conduct, but for the bad conduct of his comrades if he 
informed against them. The decurion or the preetor was 
charged with the police care of the class, and, in the absence 
of the official disciplinarian, he himself chastised his com- 
rades; in the hands of his teacher, he became a spy and an 
informer. Thus a pupil, liable to punishment for having 
spoken French contrary to orders, will be relieved from his 
punishment if he can prove by witnesses that one of his 
comrades has committed the same fault on the same day. 
158. Orrician Discrprinarian. —The rod is an element, 
so to speak, of the ancient pedagogical régime. It holds a 
privileged place both in the colleges and in private educa- 
tion. Louis XIV. officially transmits to the Duke of Mon- 
tausier the right to correct his son. Henry IV. wrote to the 
governor of Louis XIII.: ‘‘I complain because you did not 
inform me that you had whipped my son; for I desire and ~ 
order you to whip him every time that he shall be guilty of 
obstinacy or of anything else that is bad; for I well know 
that there is nothing in the world that can do him more good 
than that. This I know from the lessons of experience, for 
when I was of his age, I was soundly flogged.”’! 
The Jesuits, notwithstanding their disposition to make 
discipline milder, were careful not to renounce a punishment 
that was in use even at court. Only, while the Brethren of 
the Christian Schools, according to the regulations of La 
Salle, chastised the guilty pupil themselves, the Jesuits did 
not think it becoming the dignity of the master to apply the 
correction himself. They. reserved to a lsic the duty of

handling the rods. An official disciplinarian, a domestic, a 
‘porter, was charged in all the colleges with the functions of 
. chief executioner. And while the Ratio Studiorum recom- 
mends moderation, certain witnesses prove that the special 
disciplinarian did not always carry a discreet hand. Here, 
for example, is an account given by Saint Simon : — 
‘The eldest son of the Marquis of Boufflers was fourteen 
years old. He was handsome, well formed, was wonder- 
fully successful, and full of promise. He was a resident 
pupil of the Jesuits with the two sons of d’Argenson. I do 
not know what indiscretion he and they were guilty of. The 
Fathers wished to show that they neither feared nor stood in 
awe of any one, and they flogged the boy, because, in fact, 
they had nothing to fear of the Marquis of Boufflers; but 
they were careful not to treat the two others in this way, 
though equally culpable, because every day they had to 
count with d’Argenson, who was lieutenant of police. The 
boy Boufflers was thrown into such mental agony thaf he 
fell sick on the same day, and within four days was dead. 
... There was a universal and furious outcry against the 
Jesuits, but nothing ever came of it.”? 
159. GenErat Spreir or THe Pepagoey or THE JESuITS. — 
The general principles of the doctrine of the Jesuits are 
completely opposed to our modern ideas. Blind obedience, 
the suppression of all liberty and of all spontaneity, such is 
the basis of their moral education. 
‘* To renounce one’s own wishes ig more meritorious than 
to raise the dead ;” ‘‘ We must be so attached to the Roman 
Church as to hold for black an object which she tells us is 
black, even when it is really white;” ‘‘ Our confidence in

boat, to cross the ocean on a single plank ;” ‘If God should 
appoint for our master an animal deprived of reason, you 
should not hesitate to render it obedience, as toa master . 
and a guide, for this sole reason, that God has ordered it 
thus ;” ‘‘One must allow himself to be governed by divine 
Providence acting through the agency of the superiors of 
the Order, just as if he were a dead body that could be put 
into any position whatever, and treated according to one’s 
good pleasure ; or as if one were a baton in the hands of an 
old man who uses it as he pleases.” : 
As to intellectual education, as they understand it, it is 
wholly artificial and superficial. To find for the mind occu- 
pations that absorb it, that soothe it like a dream, without 
wholly awakening it; to call attention to words, and to 
niceties of expression, so as to reduce by so much the oppor- 
tunity for thinking; to provoke a certain degree of intel- 
lectual activity, prudently arrested at the place where the 
reflective reason succeeds an embellished memory ; in.a word, 
to excite the spirit just enough to arouse it from its inertia 
and its ignorance, but not enough to endow it with a real 
self-activity by a manly display of all its faculties, — such is 
the méthod of the Jesuits. ‘‘As to instruction,” says 
Bersot, ‘‘ this is what we find with them: history reduced to 
facts and tables, without the lesson derived from them 
bearing on the knowledge of the world; even the facts sup- 
pressed or altered when they say too much; philosophy 
reduced to what is ealled empirical doctrine, and what 
de Maistre called the philosophy of the nothing, without 
danger of one’s acquiring a liking for it; physical science 
reduced to recreations, without the spirit of research and 
liberty ; literature reduced to the complaisant explication of 
the ancient authors, and ending in innocent witticisms. ... 
With respect to letters, there are ‘two loves which have noth

ing in common save their name; one of them makes men, 
the other, great boys. It is the last that we find with the 
Jesuits ; they amuse the soul.” > 
160. THe ORarorrans. — Between the Jesuits, their adver- 
saries, and the Jansenists, their friends, the Oratorians oc- 
eupy an intermediate place. They break already with the 
over-mechanical education, and with the wholly superficial 
instruction which Ignatius Loyola had inaugurated. Through 
some happy innovations they approach the more elevated and 
more profound education of Port Royal. Founded in 1614, by 
Bérulle, the Order of the Oratory soon counted quite a large 
number of colleges of secondary instruction, and, in particu- 
lar, in 1638, the famous college of Juilly. While with the 
Jesuits it is rare to meet the names of celebrated professors, 
several renowned teachers have made illustrious the Oratory 
of the seventeenth century. We note the Pére Lamy, author 
of Entretiens sur les Sciences (1683) ; the Pére Thomassin, 
whom ‘the Oratorians call the ‘‘ incomparable theologian,” 
and who published, from 1681 to 1690, a series of Methods 
for studying the languages, philosophy, and letters; Masca- 
ron and Massillon, who taught rhetoric at the Oratory; the 
Pére Lecointe and the Pare Lelong, who taught history there. 
All these men unite, in general, some love of liberty to ardor 
of religious sentiment; they wish to introduce more air and 
more light into the cloister and the school; they have a taste 
for the facts of history and the truths of science ; finally, they 
attempt to found an education at once liberal and Christian, 
religious without abuse of devotion, elegant without refine- 
ment, solid without excess of erudition, worthy, finally, to 
be counted as one of the first practical tentatives of modern 
pedagogy. 
’ The limits of this study forbid our entering into details. 
Let us merely noté a few essential points.. That which dix
-P-A-G-E-183
THE TEACHING CONGREGATIONS. 151 
tinguishes the Oratorians, is, first,.a sincere and disinterested 
love of truth. 
‘« We love the truth,” says the Pare Lamy; ‘the days do 
not suffice to consult her as long as we would wish ; or, rather, 
- we never grow weary of the pleasure we find in studying her. 
There has always been that love for letters in this House: 
those who have governed it have tried to nourish it. When 
there is found among us some penetrating and: liberally en- 
dowed spirit who has a rare genius for the sciences, he is~. . 
discharged from all other duties.’’? 
Nowhere have ancient letters been more loved than at 
the Oratory. 
“In his leisure hours the Pére Thomassin read only the 
authors of the humanities ;” and yet French was not there 
sacrificed to Latin. The use of the Latin language was not 
obligatory till after the fourth vear, and even then not for the 
lessons in history, which, till the end of the courses, had to 
be given in French. History, so long neglected even in the 
colleges of the University, particularly the history of France, 
was taught to the pupils of the Oratory. Geography was 
not separated from it; and the class-rooms were furnished . 
with large mural maps. On the other hand, the sciences had 
a place in the course of study. <A Jesuit father would not 
have expressed himself as the Pére Lamy has done: — 
“Tt is a pleasure to enter the laboratory of a chemist. In 
the places where E have happened to be, I did not miss an 
opportunity to‘attend the anatomical lectures that were given, 
and to witness the dissection of the principal parts of the 
human -body.... I know of nothing of greater use than 
algebra and arithmetic.” 
Finally, philosophy itself, — the Cartesian philosophy, so 
mercilessly decried by the Jesuits, —was in vogue at the Ora-

tory. ‘If Cartesianism is a pest,” wrote the regents o 
College of Angers, ‘‘ there are more than two hundred vu. u. 
who are infected with it.”... ‘¢They have fe--**7* ** 
Fathers of the Oratory to teach the philosophy o 
and, consequently, the blood to circulate,” wrote 
Sévigné, in 1673. 
Let us also furnish proof of the progress anc 
of the discipline at the Oratory : — 
‘sThere are many other ways besides the 1 
Pere Lamy; ‘‘and, to lead pupils back to the 
ress, a threat, the hope of a reward, or the fea 
ation, has greater efficiency than whips.” 
The ferule, it is true, and whips also, were 1 
- but made part of the legitima panarum genera 
not appear that use was often made of them ; 
a spirit of mildness, or through prudence,'s an 
fear of exasperating the child. 
“There is needed,”’ says the Pére Lamy again, ‘ta sort of 
politics to govern this little community,—to lead then 
through their inclinations; to foresee the effect of reward: 
and punishments, and to employ them according to thei 
proper use. There are times of stubbornness when a chilc 
would sooner be killed than yield.” 
.‘What made it easier at the Orator: 
thority of the master without resorting to 
is that the same professor accompanied 1 
whole series of their classes. The } 
- example, was, in turn, professor of gre. 
osophy, mathematics, history, Italian, an: 
ing example, it must be allowed, of an 
scholastic labor. But this universality, + 
served neither the real interests of the suovro uur use U 
their pupils. The great pedagogical law is the division c

161. Fouxpatron or tas Lrrrie Scuoors. — From the 
very organization of their society, the Jansenists gave evi- 
dences of an ardent solicitude for the education of youth. 
Their founder, Saint Cyran, said: ‘‘ Education is, in a sense, 
the one thing necessary. ... J wish you might read in my heart 
the affection I feel for children. ... You could not deserve 
more of God than in working for the proper bringing up of 
children.” It was in this disinterested feeling of charity for 
the good of the young, in this display of sincere tenderness 
for children, that the Jansenists, in 1643, founded the Little 
Schools at Port Royal in the Fields, in the vicinity, and then 
in Paris... They received into those schools only a small 
number of pupils, preoccupied as they were, not with domi- 
nating the world and extending their influence, but.with do- 
ing modestly and obscurely the good they could. Persecution 
did not long grant them the leisure to continue the work they 
had undertaken. By 1660 the enemies of Port Royal had 
triumphed ; the Jesuits obtained an order from the king clos- 
ing the schools and dispersing the teachers. Pursued, impris- 
oned, expatriated, the solitaries of Port Royal had but. the 
opportunity to gather up in memorable documents the results 
of their educational experience all too short.”

saw at once the great absurdity of choosing Latin works as 
the first reading-books. ‘‘To learn Latin before learning 
the mother tongue,” said Comenius, wittily, ‘is like wishing 
to mount a horse before knowing how to walk.” And again, 
as Sainte-Beuve says, ‘‘It is to compel unfortunate children 
to deal with the unintelligible in order to proceed towards the 
unknown.” For these unintelligible texts, the Jansenists sub- 
stituted, not, it is true, original French works, but at least 
good translations of Latin authors. For the first time in 
France, the French language was made the subject of serious 
study. Before being made to write in Latin, pupils were 
drilled in writing in French. They were set to compose little 
narratives, little letters, the subjects of which were borrowed 
from their recollections, by being asked to relate on the spot 
what they had retained of what they had read. 
164. New Sysrem or Specie. —In their constant pre- 
occupation to make study easier, the Jansenists reformed the 
current method of learning to read. ‘ What makes reading 
more difficult,” says Arnauld in Chapter VI. of the General 
Grammar, ‘‘is that while each letter has its own proper name, 
itis given a different name when it is found associated with 
other letters. For example, if the pupil is made to read the 
syllable fry, he is made to say ef, ar, y, which invariably con- 
fuses him. Itis best, therefore, to teach children to know the 
letters only by the names of their real pronunciation, to name 
them only by their natural sounds.” Port Royal proposes, 
then, “‘to have children pronounce only the vowels and the 
diphthongs, and not the consonants, which they need not

pronounce, except in the different combinations which they 
form with the same vowels or diphthongs, in syllables and 
words. ; 
: This method has become celebrated under-the name of the 
Port Royal'Method ; and it appears, from a letter of Jacque- 
lme Pascal, that the original notion was due to Pascal him- 
self. 
165.. Discirying 1x Persona Rerizecrion. — That which 
profoundly distinguishes the method of the Jansenists from 
the method of the Jesuits, is that at Port Royal the purpose 
is less to make good Latinists than to train sound intelli- 
gences. The effort is to call into activity the judgment and 
personal reflection. As soon as the child is capable of it, he 
is made to think and comprehend. In the lessons of the 
class-room, not a word is allowed to pass till the child has 
understood its meaning. Only those tasks are proposed to 
the child which are adapted to his childish intelligence. His 
attention is occupied only with the things that are within the 
compass of his powers. 
The grammars of Port Royal are written in French, ‘‘be- 
cause it is ridiculous,” says Nicole, ‘‘ to teach the principles 
of a language in the very language that is to be learned, and. 
that for the present is unknown.’ Lancelot, in his Methods, 
abbreviates and simplifies grammatical studies : — 
‘‘T have found out, at last, how useful this maxim of 
Ramus is, — Few precepts and much practice: and, also, that 
‘as soon as children begin to know these rules somewhat, it is 
well to make them observe them in practice.” 
It is by the reading of authors that the grammar of Port 
Royal completes the theoretical study of the rules that are 
rigidly reduced to their minimum. The professor, with ref:

erence to such or such a passage of an author, will make ap- 
propriate oral remarks. In this way the example, not the 
dry and uninteresting one of the grammar, but the living 
example, expressive, and, drawn from a writer that is being 
read with interest, will precede or accompany the rule, and 
the particular case will explain the general law. This is an 
excellent method, because it accords with the real movement 
of the mind, and adapts the sequence of studies to the prog- 
ress of the intelligence, and also because, according to the 
advice of Descartes, the child in this way proceeds from the 
. known to the unknown, from the simple to the complex. 
166. Genera Srinit or tHE INTELLECTUAL EpucaTIon 
at Porr Royat. — Without doubt, we need not expect to 
find among the solitaries of Port Royal a disinterested devo- 
tion to science. In their view, instruction is but a means of 
forming the judgment. ‘‘ The sciences should be employed,” 
says Nicole, ‘‘only as an instrument for perfecting the 
treason.” Historical, literary, and scientific knowledge has 
no intrinsic value. The thing required is simply to employ 
those subjects for educating just, equitable, and judicious 
men. Nicole declares that it would be better absolutely to 
ignore the sciences than to become absorbed in the useless 
portions of them. Speaking of astronomical researches, and 
of the works of those mathematicians who believe that ‘it is 
the finest thing in the world to know whether there is a bridge 
and an arch suspended around the planet Saturn,” he con- 
cludes that it is preferable to be ignorant of those things 
than to be ignorant that they are vain. 
But, on the other band, the Jansenists have struck from 
their programme of studies everything that is merely sterile 
verbiage, exercises of memory or of artificial imagination. 
Little attention is given to Latin verse at Port Royal. Ver-

sion takes precedence. of the theme,’ and the oral treme 
often replaces the written. The pupil is to be taught, ‘‘ not 
to be blinded by a vain flash of words void of sense, not to 
rest satisfied with mere words or obscure principles, and 
never to be satisfied till he has gained a clear insight into 
. things.” : 
167. PepagoaicaL Princip.es or Nicote. — In his trea- 
tise on the Education of a Prince, Nicole has summarized, 
under the form of aphorisms, some of the essential princi- 
ples of his system of education. 
Let us first notice this maxim, a true pedagogical axiom: 
«The purpose of instruction is to carry forward intelligences 
to the farthest point they are capable of attaining.” This 
is saying that every child, whether of the ‘nobility or of the 
people, has the right to be instructed according to his apti- 
tude ‘and ability. 
Another axiom: We must proportion difficulties to the 
growing development of the child’s intelligence. ‘“* The 
greatest minds have but a limited range of intelligence. In 
all of them there are regions of twilight and shadow; but 
the intelligence of the child is almost wholly pervaded by 
shadows ; he catches glimpses of but few rays of light. So 
everything depends on managing these rays, on increasing 
them, and on exposing to them whatever we wish to have the 
child comprehend.” 
A corollary to the preceding axiom is, that the first 
appeal must be made to the senses. ‘‘ The intelligence of 
children always being very dependent on the senses. we 
must, as far as possible, address our instruction to the 
senses, and cause it to reach the mind, not only threugh

hearing, but also through secing.” Consequently, geogra- 
phy is a study well adapted to early years, provided we 
employ books in which the largest cities are pictured. If 
children study the history of a country, we must not neglect 
to show them the situation of places on the map. Nicole also 
recommends that they be shown pictures that represent the 
machines, the arms, and the dress of the ancients, and also 
the portraits of kings and illustrious men. 
168. Morar Pessimism.— Man is wicked, human nature 
is corrupt: such is the cry of despair that comes to our ears 
from all the writings of the Jansenists. 
“The devil,” says Saint pyran, ‘already possesses the 
soul of even the unborn child.” 
And again: ‘* We must always pray for souls, and always 
be on the watch, standing guard as in a city menaced by an 
enemy. On the outside the devil makes his rounds.” . . . 
** As soon as children begin to have reason,” says another 
Jansenist, ‘‘ we observe in them only blindness and weak- 
ness. Their minds are closed to spiritual things, and they 
cannot comprehend them. But, on the contrary, their eyes 
are open to evil; their senses are susceptible to all sorts of 
corruption, and they have a natural inertia that inclines 
them to it.” 
“*You ought,” writes Varet, ‘‘to consider your children 
as wholly inclined to evil, and carried forward towards it. 
All their inclinations are corrupt, and, not being governed 
by reason, they will permit them to find pleasure and diver- 
sion only in the things that carry them towards vice.” 
169. Errecrs on Discretine. — The doctrine of the origi- 
nal perversity of man may produce contrary results, and 
direct the practical conduct of those who accept it in two 
opposite directions. They are either inspired with severity
-P-A-G-E-192
160 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
toward beings deeply tainted and vicious, or they are excited 
to pity and to tenderness for those fallen creatures who suffer 
from an incurable evil. The solitaries of Port Royal obeyed 
the second tendency. They were as affectionate and good 
to the children confided to their care as, in theory, they were 
harsh and rigorous towards human nature. Inthe presence 
of their pupils they felt touched with an infinite tenderness 
for those poor sick souls, whom they would willingly cure of 
their ills, and raise from their fall, at the cost of any and 
every sacrifice. 
The conception of the native wickedness of man had still 
another result at Port Royal. It increased the zeal of. the 
teachers. It prompted them to multiply their assiduity and 
vigilance in order to keep guard over young souls, and there 
destroy, whenever possible, the sceds of evil that sin had 
sown in them. When one is charged with the difficult mission 
of moral education, it is, perhaps, dangerous to have too 
much confidence in human nature, and to form too favorable 
an opinion of its qualities and dispositions; for then one is 
tempted to accord to the child too large a liberty, and to 
practise the maxim, ‘‘ Let it take its own course, let it 
pass” (Laissez faire, laissez passer). It is better to err on 
the other side, in excess of mistrust; for, in this case, 
knowing the dangers that menace the child, we watch over 
him with more attention, abandon him less to the inspiration 
of his caprices, and expect more of education; we demand 
of effort and labor what we judge nature incapable of pro- 
ducing by herself. 
Vigilance, patience, mildness, — these are the instrumente 
of discipline in the schools of Port Royal. There were 
scarcely any punishments in the Little Schools. ‘To speak 
little, to tolerate much, to pray still more,” — these are the 
three things that Saint Cyran recommended. The threat to
-P-A-G-E-193
THE TEACHING CONGREGATIONS. 161 
send children home to their parents sufficed to maintain 
order in a flock somewhat small. In fact, all whose exam- 
ple would have proved bad were sent away; an excellent 
system of elimination when it is practicable. The pious 
solitaries endured without complaint, faults in which they 
saw the necessary consequences of the original fall. Pene- 
trated, however, as they were, with the value of human 
souls, their tenderness for children was mingled with a cer- 
tain respect; for they saw in’ them the creatures of God, 
beings called from eternity to a sublime destiny or to a ter- 
rible punishment. — 
170. Faoxrs iv tHe Discrptine or Porr Royar. — The 
Jansenists did not shun the logical though dangerous con- 
~equences that were involved, in germ, in their pessimistic 
heories of human nature. They fell into an excess of pru- 
lence or of rigidity. They pushed gravity and dignity to 
‘formalism that was somewhat repulsive. At Port Royal 
yapils were forbidden to thee and thou one another. The, 
olitaries did not like familiarities, faithful in this respect to 
he Imitation of Jesus Christ, in which it is somewhere said 
hat it does not become a Christian to be on familiar terms 
vith any one whatever. The young were thus brought up 
n habits of mutual respect, which may have had their good 
side, but which had the grave fault of being a little ridicu- 
ous in children, since they forced them to live among them- 
selves as little gentlemen, while at the same time they oppose 
he development of those intimate friendships, of those last- 
ng attachments of which all these who have lived at college 
imow the sweetness and the charm. 
The spirit of asceticism is the general character of all the 
Jansenists. Varet declares that balls are places of infamy. 
Pascal denies himself every agreeable thought, and what he 
valled an agreeable thought was to reflect on geometry.
-P-A-G-E-194
162 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
Lancelot refuses to take to the theatre the princes of Conti, 
of whom he was the preceptor. 
But perhaps a graver fault at Port Royal was, that through 
fear of awakening self-love, the spirit of emulation was pur- 
posely suppressed. It is God alone, it was said, who is to 
be praised for the qualities and talents manifested by men. 
‘«If God has placed something of good in the soul of a child, 
we must praise Him for it and keep silent.’’ By this delib- 
erate silence men put themselves on guard against pride ; 
but if pride is to be feared, is indolence the less so? And 
when we purposely avoid stimulating self-love through the 
hope of reward, or through a word of praise given in due 
season, we run 4 great risk of not overcoming the indo- 
lence that is natural to the child, and of not obtaining from 
him any serious effort. Pascal, the greatest of the friends 
of Port Royal, said: ‘‘ The children of Port Royal, who do 
not feel that stimulus of envy and glory, fall into a state of 
indifference.” 
171. GeneraL Jupement on Port Royar.—After all 
has been said, we must admire the teachers of Port Royal, 
who were doubtless deceived on some points, but who were 
animated by a powerful feeling of their duty to educate, and 
by a perfect charity. Ardor and sincerity of religious faith ; 
a great respect for the human person; the practice of piety 
held in honor, but kept subordinate to the reality of the 
inner feeling ; devotion advised, but not imposed ; a marked 
mistrust of nature, corrected by displays of tenderness and 
tempered by affection; above all, the profound, unwearied 
devotion of Christian souls who give themselves wholly and 
without reserve to other souls to raise them up and save 
them, —this is what was done by the discipline of Port 
Royal. But it is rather in the methods of teaching, and in 
the adininistration of classical studies, that we must look for
-P-A-G-E-195
THE TEACHING CONGREGATIONS. 163. 
the incontestable superiority of the Jansenists. ‘The teachers 
of the Little Schools were admirable humanists, not of form, 
as the Jesuits were, but of judgment. ‘They represent, it 
seems to us, in all its beauty and in all its force, that intel- 
lectual education, already divined by Montaigne, which 
prepares for life men of sound judgment and of upright 
conscience. They founded the teaching of the humanities. 
“Port Royal,” says an historian of pedagogy, Burnier, 
‘simplifies study without, however, relieving it of its whole- 
some difficulties ; it strives to make it interesting, while it 
does not convert it into child’s play; it purposes to confide 
to the memory only what has first been apprehended by the 
intelligence... . It has given to the world ideas that it has 
ot again let go, and fruitful principles from which we have 
ut to draw their logical consequences.”

ountries, with institutions of learning. 
3. The tendency towards extremes, and the difficulty of 
ttaining symmetry and completeness, are seen in the pref 
rence of the Jesuits for form, elegance, and mere discipline, 
a their excessive use of emulation ; and in the pessimism of

f human pride.]

173. Epucation IN THE SEVENTEENTH Century. — Outside 
of the teaching congregations, the seventeenth century 
counts a certain number of independent educators, isolated 
thinkers, who have transmitted to us in durable records the 
results of their reflection or of their experience. The most 
of these belong to the clergy, — they are royal preceptors. 
In a monarchical government there is no grander affair than 
the education of princes. Some others are philosophers, 
whom the general study of human nature has led to reflect 
on the principles of education: Without preten~ 
include everything within the narrow compass of t 
mentary history, we would make known either the 
mental doctrines or the essential methods which ha 
concerned in the education of the seventeenth centt.,,
-P-A-G-E-197
FENELON. 165 
which, at’ the same time, have made a preparation for the 
educational reforms of the succeeding centuries. 
174, Féxeton (1651-1715). — Fénelon holds an important 
place in French literature ; but it seems that of all the varied 
aspects of his genius. the part he played as an educator is 
the most important and the most considerable. Fénelon 
wrote the first classical work of French pedagogy, and it may 
be said, considering the great number of authors who have 
been inspired by his thoughts, that he is the head of a school 
of educators. 
175. How Ffreron secame a Tracner. —It is well 
known that the valuable treatise, On the Education of Girls, 
was written in 1680, at the request of the Duke and the 
Duchess of Beauvilliers. These noble friends of Fénelon, 
besides several boys, had eight girls to educate. It was to 
assist, by his advice, in the education of this little family 
school, that Fénelon wrote his book which was not designed 
at first for the public, and which did not appear till 1687. 
The young Abbé who, in 1680, was but thirty years old, had 
already had experience in educational matters in the man- 
agement of the Convent of the New Catholics (1678). This 
was an institution whose purpose was to retain young Protes- 
tant converts in the-Catholic faith, or even to call them there 
by mild force. It would have been better, we confess, for 
the glory of Fénelon, if he had gained his experience else- 
where than in that mission of fanaticism, where he was the 
auxiliary of the secular arm, the accomplice of dragoons, 
and where was prepared the Revocation of the Edict of 
Nantes. .We would have preferred that the Education of 
Girls had not been planned in a house where were violently 
confined girls torn from their mothers, and wives stolen from 
their husbands. But if the first source of Fénelon’s educa-
-P-A-G-E-198
166 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
tional inspiration was not as pure as one could wish, at least 
in the book there is nothing that betrays the spirit of intoler- 
ance and violence with which the author was associated. 
On the contrary, The Education of Girls is a work of gentle- 
ness and goodness, of a complaisant and amiable grace, which 
is pervaded by a spirit of progress. 
Fénelon soon had occasion to apply the principles that he 
had set forth in his treatise. August 16, 1689, he was 
chosen preceptor of the Duke of Bourgogne,’ with the Duke 
of Beauvilliers for governor, and the Abbé Fleury for sub- 
preceptor. From 1689 to 1695, he directed with marvellous 
success the education of a prince, ‘‘a born terror,” as Saint 
Simon expressed it, but who, under the penetrating influence 
of his master, became an accomplished man, almost a saint. 
It was for his royal pupil that he composed, one after 
another, a large number of educational works, such as the 
Collection of Fables, the Dialogues of the Dead, the treatise 
on The Existence of God, and especially the Telemachus, one 
of the most popular works in French literature. 
In furnishing occasion for the exercise of his educational 
activity, events served Fénelon according to his wish. We 
may say that his nature predestinated him to the work of 
education. With his tender soul, preserving its paternal 
instincts even in his celibate condition, with his admirable 
grace of spirit, with his various erudition and profound 
knowledge of antiquity, with his competence in the studies 
of grammar and history, attested by different passages in 
his Letter to the Academy ; finally, with his temperate dispo- 
sition and his inclinations towards liberalism in a century of 
absolute monarchy, he was made to become one of the guides, 
one of the masters, of French education.

176, Awatysis of THE TREATISE ON THE EDUCATION OF 
Girts. — This charming masterpiece of Fénelon’s should be 
read entire. A rapid analysis would not suffice, as it is 
difficult to reduce to a few essential points the flowing 
thought of our author. With o facility in expression inclin- 
ing to laxness, and with a copiousness of thought somewhat 
lacking in exactness, Fénelon easily repeats himself; he 
returns to thoughts which have already been elaborated, and 
does not restrict his easy flowing thought to a rigorous and 
methodical plan. We may, however, distinguish three prin- 
cipal parts in the thirteen chapters composing the work. 
Chapters I. and II. are critical, and in these the ordinary: 
faults in the education of women are brought into sharp out- 
line; then in chapters III. to VIII. we have general 
observations, and the statement of the principles and 
methods that should be followed and applied in the education 
of boys as in the education of girls; and finally, from chap- 
ter IX. to the end of the book, are all the special reflections 
which relate exclusively to the merits and demerits, the 
duties and the studies, of women. 
177, Criricism on Monastic Epucation. —In the open- 
ing of the treatise, as in another little essay! that is usually 
included in this volume, Fénelon expresses a preference for 
a liberal and humane education, where the light of the world 
penetrates, and which is not confined to the shadow. of a 
monastery :— __ 
‘«T conclude that it is better for your daughter to be with 
you than in the best convent that you could select.... If 
a convent is not well governed, she will see vanity honored, 
which is the most subtile of all the poisons that can affect a 
  
1 See the Advice of Fénelon, Archbishop Cambray, to a lady of quality 
on the education of her daughter,

168 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
young girl. She will there hear the world spoken of as a 
sort of enchanted place, and nothing makes a more perni- 
cious impression than that deceptive picture of the world, 
which is seen at a distance with admiration, and which 
exaggerates all its pleasures without showing its disappoint- 
ments and its sorrows.... So I would fear a worldly con- 
vent even more than the world itself. If, on the contrary, 
a convent conforms to the fervor and regularity of its 
constitution, a girl of rank will grow up there in a pro- 
found ignorance of the world.... She leaves the convent 
like one who had been confined in the shadows of a deep 
cavern, and who suddenly returns to the full light of day. 
Nothing is more dazzling than this sudden transition, than 
‘this glare to which one has never been accustomed.” 
178. ReruTaTion OF THE PResupiCEs RELATIVE TO THE 
Epucation or Women. — It is, then, for mothers that Féne- 
lon writes his book, still more than for the convents that he 
does not love. Woman is destined to play a grand part in 
domestic life. ‘‘Can men hope for any sweetness in life, if 
their most select companionship, which is that of marriage, 
is turned into bitterness?” Then let us cease to neglect the 
education of women, and renounce the prejudices by which 
we pretend to justify this neglect. A learned woman, it is 
said, is vain and affected! But it is not proposed that 
women shall engage in useless studies which would make 
ridiculous pedants of them; it is simply a question of teach- 
ing them what befits their position in the household. Woman, 
it is said again, ordinarily has a weaker intellect than man! 
But this is the best of reasons why it is necessary to 
strengthen her intelligence. Finally, woman should be 
brought up in ignorance of the world! But, replies Fénelon, 
the world is not a phantom; ‘‘it is the aggregate of all the
-P-A-G-E-201
FHENELON. ‘ 169 
families’; and women have duties to fulfill in it which are 
searcely leas important than those of men. ‘‘ Virtue is not 
less for women than for men.” 
179. Goop Orinion or Human Nature. — There are two 
categories of Christians: the first dwell particularly on the 
original fall; and the others attach themselves by preference 
to the doctrine of redemption. For the first, the child is 
deeply tainted with sin; his only inclinations are those 
towards evil; he is a child of wrath, who must be severely 
punished. For the others, the child, redeemed by grace, 
‘has not yet a fixed tendency towards any object”; his 
instincts have no need of being thwarted; all they need is 
direction. Fénelon follows this last mode of thinking, which 
is the correct one. He does not fear self-love, and does not 
interdict deserved praise. He counts upon the spontaneity 
of nature. He regrets the education of the ancients, who 
left more liberty to children. Finally, in his judgments on 
human nature, he is influenced by a cheerful and amiable 
optimism, and sometimes by an excess of complacency and 
approbation. 
180. Frxs.eness or roe Cuiip. — But if Fénelon believes 
in the innocence of the child, he is not the less convinced of 
its feebleness. Hence the measures he recommends to those. 
who have in charge the bringing up of children: ‘The 
most important thing in the first years of infancy is the 
management of the child’s health. Through the selection of 
food and the régime of a simple life, the body should be 
supplied with pure blood.... Another thing of great im- 
portance is to allow the organs to strengthen by holding 
instruction in abeyance... .” The intellectual weakness of 
the child comes for the most part from his inability to fix his 
attention. . ‘‘ The mind of the child is like a lighted taper in
-P-A-G-E-202
170 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
a place exposed to the wind, whose flame is ever unsteady.” 
Hence the urgent necessity of not pressing children beyond ~ 
measure, of training them little by little as occasion permits, 
*¢ of serving and assisting Nature, without urging her.” 
181. Instructive Cortosiry; Opsect Lessons. — If the 
inattention of the child is a great obstacle to his progress, 
his natural curiosity, by way of compensation, is a potent 
auxiliary. Fénelon knows the aid that can be derived from 
this source, and we shall quote entire the remarkable passage 
in which he indicates the means of calling it into exercise 
through familiar lessons which are already real lessons on 
objects : — 
‘+ Curiosity in children is a natural tendency which comes 
as the precursor of instruction. Do not fail to take advan- 
tage of it. For example, in the country they see a mill, and 
they wish to know what it is. They should be shown the 
manner of preparing the food that is needed for human use, 
They notice harvesters, and what they are doing should be 
explained to them; also, how the wheat is sown, and how it 
multiplies in the earth. In the city, they see shops where 
different arts are practised, and where different wares are 
sold. You should never be annoyed by their questions; 
these are so many opportunities offered you by nature for 
facilitating the work of instruction.” Show that you take 
pleasure in replying to such questions, and by this means 
you will insensibly teach them how all the things are made 
that serve human needs, and that give rise to commercial 
pursuits.” 
182. Tspmecr Instruction. —Even when the child has 
grown up, and is more capable of receiving direct instruc- 
tion, Fénelon does not depart from his system of mild man- 
agement and precaution.. There are to be no didactic lessons,

but as far a8 possible the instruction shall be indirect. This 
' js the great educational method of Fénelon, and we shall 
soon see how he applied it to the education of the Duke of 
Bourgogne. ‘The less formal our lessons are, the better.” 
However, there is need of discretion and prudence in the 
choice of the first ideas, and the first pictures that are to be 
impressed on the child’s mind. 
‘Into a reservoir so little and so precious only exquisite 
things should be poured.” The absence of pedantry is one 
of the characteristics of Fénelon. ‘‘In rhetoric,” he says, 
“<T will give no rules at all; it is sufficient to give good 
models.” As to grammar, ‘(I will give it no attention, or, 
at least, but very little.’ Instruction must be insinuated, 
not imposed. We must resort to unexpected lessons, —— to 
such as do not appear to be lessons. Fénelon here antici- 
pates Rousseau, and suggests the system of pre-arranged 
scenes and instructive artifices, similar to those invented for 
Emile. 
183, Aut Activity musT BE PLeasuRABLE. — One of the 
best qualities of Fénelon as a teacher is that of wishing that 
study should be agreeable; but this quality becomes a fault 
with him, because he makes an abuse of attractive instrac- 
tion. We can but applaud him when he criticises the harsh 
and crabbed pedagogy of the Middle Age, and depicts to us 
those tiresome and gloomy class-rooms, where teachers are 
ever talking to children of words and things of which they 
understand nothing. ‘‘No liberty,” he says, ‘‘no enjoy- 
ment, but always lessons, silence, uncomfortable postures, 
correction, and threats.”” And so there is nothing more just 
than this thought: ‘‘In the current education, all the pleas-

172 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
ure is put on one side, and all that is disagreeable on the 
other; the disagreeable is all put into study, and all the 
pleasure is found in the diversions.” Féfelon would change 
all this. For study, as for moral discipline, ‘‘ pleasure must 
do all.” 
First, as to study, seek the means of making agreeable to 
children whatever you require of them. ‘‘We must always 
place before them a definite and agreeable aim to sustain 
them in their work.” ‘Conceal their studies under the 
appearance of liberty and pleasure.” Let their range of 
vision extend itself-a little, and their intelligence acquire 
more breadth.” ‘‘ Mingle instruction with play.” ‘I have 
seen,” he says again, ‘‘ certain children who have learned to 
read while playing.” 
For giving direction to the will, as for giving activity to 
the intelligence, never subject children to cold and absolute 
authority. Do not weary them by an indiscreet exactness. 
Let wisdom appear to them only at intervals, and then with 
a laughing face. Lead them by reason whenever it is pos- 
sible for you to do it. Never assume, save in case of ex- 
treme necessity, an austere, imperious air that makes them 
tremble. 
«© You would close their heart and destroy their confidence, 
without which there is no profit to hope for from education. 
Make yourself loved by them. Let them fee 
your presence, so that they do not fear to have 
faults.” 
Such, intellectually and morally, is the amia! 
dreamed of by Fénelon. It is evident that the 
of our author conducts him a little too far abu scaus aun 
astray. Fénelon sees everything on the bright side. 
education, such as this too complacent teacher dreams o 
there is no difficulty, nothing laborious, no thorns. ‘

FENELON. 173 
metals there are gold ; all flowers there are roses.” The 
child is almost exempted from making effort: he shall not 
be made to repeat the lesson he has heard, ‘for fear of an- 
noying him.” It is necessary that he learn everything while 
playing. If he has faults, he must not be told of them, save 
with precaution, ‘for fear of hurting his feelings.” Fénelon 
is decidedly too good-natured, too much given to cajolery. 
In his effort to shun whatever is repulsive, he comes to ex- 
elude whatever is laborious. He falls into an artless pleasantry 
when he demands that the books of his pupil shall be 
“beautifully bound, with gilt edges, and fine pictures.” 
184. Fapies anp History. Fénelon’s very decided 
taste for agreeable studies, determines him to place in the 
foremost rank of the child’s intellectual occupations, fables 
and history, because narratives please the infant imagination 
above everything else. It is with sacred history especially 
that he would have the attention occupied, always selecting 
from it ‘that which presents the most pleasing and the 
most magnificent pictures.” He properly demands, more- 
over, that the teacher ‘‘ animate his narrative with lively and 
familiar tones, and so make all his characters speak.” By 
this means we shall hold the attention of children without 
forcing it; ‘for, once more,” he says, ‘““we must be very 
careful not to impose on them a, law to hear and to remember 
these narratives.” 
185. Morat anp Reziaious Epucatiox. — Contrary to 
Rousseau’s notions, Fénelon requires that children should 
early bave their attention turned to moral and religious 
traths. He would have this instruction given in the con- 
crete, by means of examples drawn from experience. We 
need not fear to speak to them of God as a venerable old 
man, with white beard, etc. Whatever of the superstitious

174 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
there may be in these conceptions adapted to the ‘infant 
imagination will be corrected afterwards by the reason. 
It is to be noted, moreover, that a religion of extremes is 
not what Fénelon desires. He fears all exaggerations, even 
that of piety. What he demands is a tempered devotion, a 
reasonable Christianity. He is suspicious of false miracles. 
‘* Accustom girls,” he says, ‘‘not to accept thoughtlessly 
certain unauthorized narrations, and not to practise certain 
forms of devotion introduced by an indiscreet zeal.” But 
possibly, without intending it, Fénelon himself is preparing 
the way for the superstition he combats, when, for the pur- 
pose of indoctrinating the child with the first principles of 
religion, he presents to him the notion of God under sensi- 
ble forms, and speaks to him of a paradise where all is of 
gold and precious stones. 
186. Sroprzs Proper ror Women. —So far, we have noted 
in Fénelon’s work only general precepts applicable to boys 
and girls alike. But in the last part of his work, Fénelon 
treats especially of women’s own work, of the qualities pecu- 
liarly their own, of their duties, and of the kind of instruction 
they need in order to fulfill them. 
No one knew better than Fénelon the faults that come to 
woman through ignorance, — unrest, unemployed time, in- 
ability to apply herself to solid and serious duties, frivolity, 
indolence, lawless imagination, indiscreet curiosity concern- 
ing trifles, levity, and talkativeness, sentimentalism, and, 
what is remarkable with a friend of Madame Guyon, a mania 
for theology: ‘‘Women are too much inclined to speak 
decisively on religious questions.” 
What does Fénelon propose as a corrective of these 
mischievous tendencies? It must be confessed that the plan 
of instruction which he proposes is still insufficient, and that 
‘it scarcely accords with the ideal as we conceive it to-day.
-P-A-G-E-207
FENELON. 15 
“Keep young girls,” he says, ‘within tae common 
bounds, and teach them that there should be for their sex a 
modesty with respect to knowledge almost as delicate as that 
inspired by the horror of vice.” 
Is not this the same as declaring that knowledge is. not 
intended for women, and that it is repugnant to their. deli- 
cate nature? 
When Fénelon tells us that a young girl ought to learn to 
read and write correctly (and observe that account is taken 
only of the daughters of the nobility and of the wealthy 
middle classes) ; when he adds, let her also learn grammar, 
we can infer from these puerile prescriptions, that Fénelon 
does not exact any great things from women in the way of 
knowledge. And yet, such as it is, this programme sur- 
passed, in the time of Fénelon, the received custom, and 
constituted a substantial progress. It was to state an excel- 
lent principle, whose consequences should have been more 
fully analyzed, to demand that women should learn all that is 
necessary for them to know, in order to bring up their 
children. Fénelon should also be commended for having 
recommended to young women the reading of profane 
authors. He who had been nourished on such literature, who 
was, so to speak, but a Greek turned Christian, who knew 
Homer so perfectly as to write the Telemachus, could not, 
without belying himself, advise against the studies from 
which he had derived so much pleasure and profit. He also 
recognized the utility of history, ancient and modern. He 
grants a place to poetry and eloquence, provided an elimina- 
tion be made of whatever would be dangerous to purity of 
morals. What we comprehend less easily is that he con- 
demns, as severely as he does, music, which, he says, “ fur- 
nishes diversions that are poisonous.” 
But these faults, this mistrust of too high an intellectual
-P-A-G-E-208
176 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
guiture, ought not to prevent us from admirmg the Education 
of Girls. Let us be grateful to Fénelon for having resisted, 
in part, the prejudices of a period when young women were 
condemned by their sex to an almost absolute ignorance ; for 
having declared that he would follow a course contrary ‘‘ to 
that of alarm-and of a superficial culture of the intelligence ” ; 
and finally, for having written a book, all the generous in- 
spirations of which Madame de Maintenon herself has not 
caught ; and of which we may say, finally, that almost every- 
thing that it contains is excellent, and that it is defective 
only in what it does not contain. 
187. Mapame pe Lamperr (1647-1733).— Fénelon, as 
an educator of women, was the founder of a school. From 
Rollin to Madame de Genlis, how many teachers have beer 
inspired by him! But in the front rank. of his pupils we 
must place Madame de Lambert. In her Counsels to her Son 
(1701), and especially in her Counsels to her Daughter (1728), 
she has taken up tbe tradition of Fénelon with greater 
breadth and freedom-of spirit. ‘As discreet as he with 
respect to works of the imagination, of which she fears that 
the reading may inflame the mind ;” more severe, even, than 
he towards Racine, whose name she seems to hesitate to 
pronounce ; disposed to exclude her daughter from ‘ plays, 
representations that move the passions, music, poetry, —all 
belonging to the retinue of pleasure, — in other respects, 
Madame de Lambert takes precedence and surpasses her 
master” (Gréard). She reproaches Moliére for having 
abandoned women to idleness, pastime, and pleasure. She 
loves history, especially the history of France, ‘‘ which no 
one is permitted not to know.” Finally, without entering 
into the details of her protests, she makes a powerful plea for 
the cause of woman’s education; she already belongs to the 
eighteenth century.
-P-A-G-E-209
FENELON. LT 
188. Epvucation or tHe DvuKe or Bourcocne. — Singu- 
larly enough, Fénelon did not make an application of his 
ideas on education till after he had set them forth in a 
theoretical treatise. The education of the Duke of Bour- 
gogne permitted him to make a practical test of the rules 
established in the Education of Girls. Nothing is of more 
interest to the historian of pedagogy than the study of that 
princely education into which Fénelon put all his mind and 
heart, and which, by its results, at once brilliant and insuffi- 
cient, exhibits the merits and the faults of his plan of 
education. 
189. Harpy Resutrs. —The Duke of Bourgogne with his 
active intelligence, and also with his impetuous, indocile 
character, and his fits of passion, was just the pupil for the 
teacher who relied on indirect instruction. It would have 
been unwise to indoctrinate with heavy didactic lessons a 
spirit so impetuous. ‘Through tact and industry, Fénelon 
succeeded in captivating the attention of the prince, and in 
skillfully insinuating into his mind knowledges that he would 
probably have rejected, had they been presented to it ina 
scientific and pedantic form. ‘‘ I have never seen a child,” 
says Fénelon, ** who so readily understood the finest things 
. of poetry and eloquence.” Doubtless the happy nature of the 
prince contributed a large part towards these results; bat 
the art of Fénelon bad also its share in the final account. 
190. Morat Lxssoxs; Tae Fasies. —How shall morals 
be taught to a violent and passionate child? Fénelon did 
not think of preaching fine sermons to him; but presented 
to him, under the form of Fables, the moral precepts that he 
wished to inculcate. The Fables of Fénelon certainly have 
not, as a whole, a large literary value; but, to form a just 
appreciation of them, we must recollect that their merit is
-P-A-G-E-210
178 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
especially to be seen in the circumstances attending their 
composition. Composed from day to day, they were adapted 
to the circumstances of the life of the young prince; they 
were filled with allusions to his faults and his virtues, and 
they conveyed to him, at the favorable moment, under the veil 
of a pleasing fiction, the commendation or the censure that he 
deserved. ‘‘One might,” says the Cardinal de Bausset, 
‘* follow the chronological order in which these pieces were 
composed, by comparing them with the progress which age 
and. instruction must have made in the education of the 
prince.” The apologues, even with their very general morals, 
will always have their value and place in the education of 
children. What shall be said of the fables in which the 
moral, wholly individual, was addressed exclusively to the 
pupil for whom they were written, either on account of some 
perversity that he let come to the surface, or of a rising virtue 
that had been manifested in his conduct? It is thus that the 
fable called The Capricious presented to the young duke the 
picture of his fits of passion, and taught him to correct him- 
self; that of the Bee and the Fly reminded him that the 
most brilliant qualities serve no good purpose without mod- 
eration. One day, in a fit of anger, the prince so far forgot 
himself as to say to Fénelon, who was reproving him: ‘* No, 
no, Sir! Iknow who I am, and who you are!” The next 
day, doubtless in response to this explosion of princely self- 
conceit, Fénelon had him read the fable entitled Bacchus 
and the Faun: ** As Bacchus could not abide a malicious 
jeerer always ready to make sport of his expressions that 
were not correct and elegant, he said to him in a fiery and 
important tone: ‘‘ How dare you jeer the son of Jupiter?” 
The Faun replied without emotion: ‘‘ Alas! how does the 
son of Jupiter dare to commit any fault?” 
Certain fables, of a more elevated tone than the others,
-P-A-G-E-211
FENELON, : 179 
are not designed simply to correct the faults of children; 
they prepare the prince for the exercise of government. 
Thus, the fable of the Bees disclosed to him the beauties of 
an industrious State, and one where order reigns; the Wile 
and the Ganges taught him love for the people, ‘‘ compassion 
for humanity, harassed and suffering.” Finally, from each - 
of these fables there issued a serious lesson under the pleas- 
ing exterior of a witticism; and more than once, in reading 
them, the prince doubtless felt an emotion of pleasure or of 
shame, as he recognized himself in a commendation or in a 
reproof addressed to the imaginary personages of the Fables. 
191. Hisrortcat Lussons ; Tar DiaLocuss or rae Deap.— 
It is not alone in moral education, but in intellectual educa- 
tion as well, that Fénelon resorts to artifice. The ingenious 
preceptor has employed fiction in all its forms the better to 
eompass and dominate the spirit of his pupil. There are the 
fables for moral instruction, the dialogues for the study of 
history, and finally, the epopee in the Zelemachus, for the 
political education of the heir to the throne of France. 
The Dialogues of the Dead put on the stage men of all 
countries and conditions, Charles the Fifth and a monk of 
Saint Just, Aristotle and Descartes, Leonardo da Vinci and 
Poussin, Cesar and Alexander. History proper, literature, 
philosophy, the arts, were the subjects of conversations com- 
posed, as in the Fables, at different intervals, according to 
the progress and the needs of the Duke of Bourgogne. 
These were attractive pictures that came from time to time 
to be introduced into the scheme for the didactic study of 
universal history. They should be taken only for what they . 
were intended to be, — the pleasing complement to a regular 
and consecutive course of instruction. Fénelon knew better 
than any one else that history is interesting in itself, and
-P-A-G-E-212

that to make the study of it interesting, it is sufficient to pre 
sent it to the childish imagination with clearness, with vivac- 
ity, and with feeling. 
192. Varrety or Discrptinary Acents. — The education 
-of the Duke of Bourgogne is the practical application of 
Fénelon’s principles as to the necessity of employing an 
insinuating gentleness rather than an authority which dryly 
commands. ‘There are to be no sermons, no lectures, but 
indirect means of moral instruction: The Duke of Bourgogne 
was irascible. Instead of reading to him Seneca’s treatise 
On Anger, this is Fénelon’s device: One morning he has 
a cabinet-maker come to his apartments, whom he has in- 
structed for the purpose. The prince enters, stops, and 
looks at the tools. ‘‘Go about your business, Sir,” cries 
the workman, who assumes a most threatening air, ‘* for I 
am not responsible for what I may do; when I am in a pas- 
sion, I break the arms and legs of those whom I meet.” We 
guess the conclusion of the story, and how, by this experi- 
mental method, Fénelon contrives to teach the prince to 
guard against anger and its effects. 
When indirect means did not answer, Fénelon employed 
others. Itis thus that he made frequent appeals to the self- 
love of his pupil; he reminded him of what he owed to his 
name and to the hopes of France. He had him record his 
word of houor that he would behave well: ‘“‘I promise the 
Abbé Fénelon, on the word of a prince, that I will obey 
him, and that, in case I break my word, I will submit to any 
kind of punishment and dishonor. Given at-Versailles, this 
- 29th day of November, 1689. Signed: Louis.” At other 
times Fénelon appealed to his feelings, and conquered him 
by his tenderness and goodness. It ig in such moments of 
tender confidence that the prince said to him, ‘*T leave the
-P-A-G-E-213

Duke of Bourgogne outside the door, and with you I am but 
the little Louis.” Finally, at other times, Fénelon resorted 
to the harshest punishments ; he sequestered him, took away. 
his books, and interdicted all conversation. 
193, Drversirrep Instruction. — By turns serious and 
tender, mild and severe, in his moral discipline, Fénelon was 
not less versatile in his methods of instruction. His domi- 
nant preoccupation was to diversify studies —the term is 
his own. If a given subject of study was distasteful to his 
pupil, Fénelon passed to another. Although the success of 
his tutorship seems to be a justification of his course, there 
is ground for thinking that, as a general rule, Fénelon’s 
precept is debatable, and that his example should not be fol- 
lowed by making an over-use of amusement and agreeable’ 
variety. Fénelon has too often made studies puerile througl: 
his attempts to make them agreeable. 
194, Resuits or tHe Epvcation or tHE DuKE or Bour- 
cocre. —It seems like a paradox to say that Fénelon was 
too successful in his educational apostleship ; and yet this.is 
the truth. Under his hand— ‘the ablest hand that ever 
was,” says Saint Simon— the prince became in all respects 
the image of his master. He was a bigot to the extent of 
being unwilling to attend a royal ball because that worldly 
entertainment coincided with the religious celebration of the 
Epiphany ; he was rather a monk than a king; he was desti- 
tute of all spirit of initiative and liberty, irresolute, absorbed 
in his pious erudition and mystic prayers; finally, he was 
another Telemachus, who could not do without his Mentor. 
Fénelon had monopolized and absorbed the will of -his pupil. 
Ue had forgotten that the purpose of education is to form: 
not a pale copy, an image of the master, but a man inde 
pendest and free, capable of sufficing for himself.
-P-A-G-E-214
182 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
195. Tae Tetemacuvs.—The Telemachus, composed 
from 1694 to 1698, was designed for the Duke of Bour- 
gogne; but he was not to read it, and did not read it, in 
fact, till after his marriage. ‘Through this epopee in prose, 
this romance borrowed from Homer, Fénelon purposed to 
continue the moral education of his pupil. But the book 
abounds in sermons, ‘I could have wished,” said Boileau, 
‘¢ that the Abbé had made his Mentor a little less a preacher, 
and that the moral of the book could have been distributed 
a little more imperceptibly, and with more art.” At least, 
they are beautiful and excellent sermons, aimed against lux- 
ury, the spirit of conquest, the consequences of absolute 
power, and against ambition and war. Louis XIV. had 
. probably read the Telemachus, and had comprehended the 
allusions concealed in the description of the Republic of 
Salentum, when he said of Fénelon that he was ‘the most 
ehimerical spirit in his kingdom.” Besides the moral lesson 
intended for princes, the Zelemachus also contains bold 
reflections on political questions. For example, note the 
conception of a system of public instruction, very new for 
the time : \‘‘ Children belong less to their parents than to the 
Republic, aiid ought to be educated by the State. T™ 
should be established public schools in which are taught 
fear of God, love of country, and respect for the laws,’ 
196. Bossuer anp FéneLon. — Bossuet, as preceptor of 
the Dauphin,’ was far from having the same success as 
Fénelon. Nothing was overlooked, however, in the « ~ 
tion of the son of Louis XIV.; and the Letter to 
Innocent XI. (1679), in which Bossuet presents his sv.c.. 
of study, gives proof of high fitness for educational work.

FENELON. : ‘183 
He recommends assiduous labor, no leaves of: absence, 
and play mingled with study. ‘A child must play and 
enjoy. himself,” he says. Emulation excited by the presence 
of other children, who came to compete with the prince; a 
thorough reading of the Latin authors, explained, not in 
fragments, as with the Jesuits, but in complete texts; a.cer- 
tain breadth of spirit, since the study of the comic poets — 
of Terence in particular — was expressly recommended ; a 
familiarity with the Greeks and the Romans, ‘especially 
with the divine Homer”; the grammar learned in French; 
history, ‘‘the mistress of human life,” studied with ardor, 
and presented, first, in its particular facts, in the lessons 
which the Dauphin drew up, and then in its general laws, 
the spirit of which has been transmitted to us in the Dis- 
course on Universal History; geography learned ‘ while 
playing and making imaginary journeys”; philosophy; and 
finally the sciences, brilliantly presented, — with such a pro- 
gramme, and under such a master, it seems that the Dauphin 
ought to have been a student of the highest rank; but he 
remained a mediocre pupil, ‘‘ absorbed,” to use Saint 
Simon’s expression, ‘‘ in his own fat and gloom.” 
It must certainly be acknowledged that, notwithstanding 
his excellent intentions, Bossuet was in part responsible for 
the fact that these results were insufficient, or, rather, nil. 
He did not know how “ to condescend,” as Montaigne says, 
“to the boyish ways of his pupil.” In dealing with him he 
proceeded on too high a plane. ‘‘The austere genius of 
Bossuet,” says Henry Martin, ‘did not know how to be- 
come small with the small.” Bossuet lacked in flexibility 
and tact, precisely. the qualities that characterized Fénelon. 
Bossvet, in education, as in everything else, is grandeur, 
noble and sublime bearing; Fénclon, as preceptor, is ad- 
dress, insinuating grace. That which dominates in the one
-P-A-G-E-216
184. THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
is authority, a majesty almost icy; that which constitutes 
the charm of the other is versatility, a persuasive gentleness, 
a, penetrating tenderness. 
' To be just, however, it must be added that the faults were 
not all on Bossuet’s side. In that education, stamped with 
failure, the pupil was the great culprit, with his ungrateful 
and rebellious nature. ‘My lord has much spirit,” said a 
courtier, ‘‘ but he has it concealed.” For ove not a courtier, 
does it.not amount to the same thing to have one’s spirit 
concealed and to have none at all? 
197. SpHere and Luonrs or Epucation. — It seems that, 
on one page of the Education of Girls, Fénelon has traced 
in advance, and by a sort of divination, the parallels of the 
two educations of the Dauphin and of the Duke of Bour- 
gogne respectively. How can we fail to recognize the 
anticipated portrait of Fénelon’s future pupil in this passage, 
written in 1680? . 
“It must be acknowledged, that of all the difficulties in 
education, none is comparable to that of bringing up chil- 
dren who are lacking in sensibility. The naturally quick 
and. sensitive are capable of terrible mistakes, —passion and 
presumption do so betray them! But they have also great 
resources, and when far gone often come to themselves. In- 
struction is a germ concealed within them, which starts, and 
sometimes bears fruit, when experience comes to the aid of 
knowledge, and the passions lose their power. At least, 
we know how to make them attentive, and to awaken their 
eutiosity. We have the means of interesting them, and of 
stimulating them through their sense of honor; but, on the 
other hand, we can gain no hold on indolent natures.” 
On the other hand, all that follows applies perfectly to the 
Dauphin, the indocile pupil of Bossnet : —
-P-A-G-E-217
FENELON. ~ " 1485 
_ «'s,, All the thoughts of these are distractions; they are 
never where they ought to be; they cannot be touched to 
the quick even by corrections ; they hear everything and feel 
nothing. This indolence makes the pupil negligent, and 
disgusts him with whatever he does. Under these conditions, 
the best. planned education runs the risk of failure... . 
Many people, who think superficially, conclude from this 
poor success that nature does all for the production of men 
of merit, and that education has no part in the result; but 
the only conelusion to be drawn from the case is, that there 
are natures like ungrateful soils, upon which culture has but 
little effect.”* 
Nothing better can be said, and Fénelon has admirably 
summed up the lesson that should be drawn from these two 
princely illustrations of the seventeenth century. If the 
sorry results of Bossuet’s efforts should inspire the educator 
with some modesty, and prove to him that the best grain 
does not grow in an ingrate soil, is not the brilliant educa- 
tion of the Duke of Bourgogne, which developed almost all 
the virtues in a soul where nature seemed to have planted 
the seeds of all the vices, of a nature to increase the con- 
fidence of teachers, and show them what can be done by the 
art of a shrewd and able teacher? 
198. Awazyrica, Summary. —1. Education as a plastic 
art has never been exhibited in a more favorable light than 
in this history of Fénelon’s teaching; and perhaps the 
resistance that sometimes sets at defiance the teacher’s art 
could not be better illustrated than in the case of Bossuet’s 
royal pupil. . 
2. These two historical illustrations also exhibit the play 
of the two factors that enter into education, — nature and

186 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
art. Fénelon’s teaching illustrates the potency of human 
art in controlling, modifying, almost re-creating a work of 
nature. The Duke of Bourgogne was almost re-made to 
order. 
3. Here is also an illustrious example of the attempt to 
make education a pastime, to divest it of all constraint, to 
make learning run parallel with the pupil’s inclinations. In 
the natural recoil from a dry and formal teaching that had 
to be enforced against the pupil’s will, it is sometimes for- 
gotten that a large part of life’s duties lie outside of our 
inclinations. 
4. The policy of leading pupils at such a distance that

LYTICAL SUMMARY, 
199. Descartes, MALEBRANCHE, AND Lockr.— Descartes, 
a spiritualist ; Malebranche, an idealist ; Locke, a sensation- 
alist, — such are the philosophers of the seventeenth century 
who are related to the history of pedagogy. And yet the 
frst two have only a remote connection with it, through their 
exposition of some of its general principles. Locke is the 
only one *who has resolutely approached educational ques- 
tions in a special treatise that has become a classic in Eng- 
lish pedagogy. 
200. Descartes (1596-1650). — Descartes, the father of 
modern philosophy, does not generally figure in the lists 
drawn up by the historians of education; and yet, in our
-P-A-G-E-220

opinion, there is no thinker who has exercised a more deci- 
sive influence on the destinies of education. ‘The author of 
the Discourse of Method has, properly speaking, no system 
of pedagogy, having never directly treated of educational 
affairs; bat through his philosophical principles he bas 
changed the direction of human thought, and has intro- 
duced into the study of known truths, as well as into the 
search for new truths, a method and a taste for clearness 
and precision, which have profited instruction in all of its 
departments. 
‘We now find,”’ says Rollin, ‘‘ in the discourses from the 
pulpit and the bar, and in the dissertations on science, an 
order, an exactness, a propriety, and a solidity, which wera 
formerly not so common. Many believe, and not without 
reason, that we owe this mannér of thinking and writing to 
the extraordinary progress which has been made within a 
a century in the study of philosophy.”! 
201, Tue Discourse or -MeTHop (1637).—Every system 
of philosophy contains in germ a special system of educa- 
tion. From the mere fact that philosophers define, each in 
his own way, the nature and the destiny of man, they come 
to different conclusions as to the aims and methods of educa- 
tion. Only a few of them have taken pains to deduce from 
their principles the consequences that are involved in them; 
but all of them, whether they will or no, are educators. 
Such is the case of Descartes. In writing, in the first 
part of his Discourse of Method, his Considerations Touching 
the Sciences, Descartes has written a chapter on practical 
pedagogy, and through the general rules of his logic, he 
has, in effect, founded a new theory of education.

202. Crrmeism or rae Correnr Epucation.—Descartes 
has given a long account of the education which he had re- 
ceived among the Jesuits, at the college of La Fiéche, and 
this account furnished him occasion, either to criticize the 
methods in use, or to indicate his personal views and his 
educational preferences. 
“From my infancy letters have been my. intellectual 
nourishment.... But as soon as I had completed the 
course of study required for the doctor’s degree, I found 
myself embarrassed with so many doubts and errors that it 
seemed to me that I had received no other profit from my 
efforts at learning than the discovery of my growing igno- 
rance.” 
In other terms, Descartes ascertained that his studies, 
though pursued with ardor for eight years in one of the 
most celebrated schools of Europe, had not permitted him 
to acquire ‘¢a clear and sure knowledge of all that is useful 
for living.” This was to condemn the barren teaching and 
the formal instruction of the Jesuits. Passing in review the 
different parts. of the instruction, Descartes first remarks 
that it was wrong to make an abuse of the reading of 
ancient books; for, to hold converse with the men of other 
centuries ‘‘is about the same as travelling; and when we 
spend too much time in travelling, we become strangers in 
our own country.” Then he complains that he was not 
made to know “the trae use of mathematics,” since he had 
been shown their application only to the mechanic arts. He 
nearly condemns rhetoric and poetics, since eloquence. and 
‘poetry are ‘‘ intellectual gifts rather than the fruits of study.” 
The ancient languages—and in this he gravely deceives 
himself —seem to him useful only for the understanding of 
authors. .He does not admit that the study of Latin o1 
Greek can contribute to intellectual development.
-P-A-G-E-222
190 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
From these‘reflections there seems to issue the notion of 
an instruction more solid, more positive, more directly use- 
ful for the purposes of life, than that which had been 
brought into fashion by the Jesuits. However, Descartes 
does not eliminate the ordinary studies, as eloquence, 
‘which has incomparable power and beauty”; poetry, 
‘swhich has an enchanting tenderness and melody”; the 
reading of the classics, which is ‘‘a studied conversation 
with the most estimable men of past centuries” ; history, 
‘which forms the judgment”; fables, whose “charm arouses 
the spirit.” But he would give to all these exercises a more 
practical turn, a more utilitarian character, a more positive 
application. 
208. Great Principles or Moprrn Pepacocy. — With- 
out intending it, without any other thought than that of 
modifying the false direction of the mind in the search for 
scientific truth, Descartes has stated some of the great, prin- 
ciples of modern pedagogy. 
The first is the equal aptitude of minds to know and com- 
prehend. ‘* Good sense,” says Descartes, ‘‘is the thing of 
all else in this world that is most equally distributed.’ . . . 
The latent ability to judge well, to distinguish the true from 
the false, is naturally equal among all men.” What is this 
but saying that all men are entitled to instruction? In a cer- 
tain sense, what are the innumerable primary schools scattered 
over the surface of the civilized globe, but the application 
and the living commentary of Descartes’ ideas on the equal 
distribution of good sense and reason among men? 
1 Lam in doubt whether M. Compayré intends to sanction this doctrine 
or not. This is an anticipation of one of Jacotot’s paradoxes: ‘ All human 
beings are equally capable of learning.” The verdict of actnal teachers 
is undoubtedly to the effect that there are manifold differences in the 
ability of pupils to know, comprehend, and judge. (P.)
-P-A-G-E-223
PHILOSOPHERS OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY. 191 
But, adds Descartes, ‘‘it is not enough to have a sound 
mind; the principal thing is to make a good use of it.” In 
other words, nature is not sufficient in herself ; she needs to 
be guided and directed. Method is the essential thing; it 
has a sovereign importance. Success will depend less on 
natural qualities, such as imagination, memory, quickness 
of thought, than upon the rules of intellectual direction. 
imposed on the mind. Education has a far greater part 
than nature in the formation and development of accurate 
and upright intelligences. 
Another Cartesian principle is the substitution of free 
inquiry and reflective conviction for blind beliefs founded 
upon authority. Descartes promulgated this famous rule of 
his method: “The first precept is, never to receive anything 
for true that I do not know, upon evidence, to be such; . .. 
and to comprise no more within my judgments than what ‘is 
presented so clearly and distinctly to my mind that I have 
no occasion to call it in question.” In this declaration he 
has not only reformed science and revolutionized philoso- 
phy, but has banished from the school the old routine, the 
mechanical processes and exercises of pure memory, and, 
has made a demand for rational methods that excite the 
intelligence, awaken clear and distinct ideas, and provoke 
jadgment and reflection. Of course, it is not proposed to 
make a little Descartes out of every child, despoiling him 
of received beliefs in order to construct personal opinions 
de novo; but the rule of evidence, applied with moderation 
and discretion, is none the less an excellent pedagogical 
precept, which will never be disallowed by those who wish 
to make of the child something more than a mere machine. 
204. Opsective anp SuBsective Pepagocy.— We have 
now reached a place where we may call into notice two dif- 
ferent tendencies, equally legitimate, which we shall find,
-P-A-G-E-224
192 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
with exaggerations that compromise their utility, in the 
practice of modern teachers. There are those who wish 
above all to develop the intelligence; and there are others 
who are preoccupied with furnishing the mind with a stock 
of positive knowledge. The first conceive instruction as 
taking place, as it were, through what is within, through the 
development of the internal qualities of precision and meas- 
ure; the others are preoccupied only with the instruction 
that takes place through what is without, through an ex- 
tended erudition, through an accumulation of knowledges. 
In'a word, if I may be allowed the expression, some affect 
a subjective pedagogy, and others an objective pedagogy. 
Bacon is of the latter number. That which preoccupies the 
great English logician above everything else is the exten- 
sion of observations and experiments. ‘‘ To reason without 
knowing anything of that which we reason upon,” he says, 
“is as if we were to weigh or measure the wind.” Des- 
cartes, however, who has never neglected the study of facts, 
esteems them less as material to be accumulated in the mind, 
than as instruments for training the mind itself. He would 
have repudiated those teachers of our day who seem to 
think the whole thing is done when there has been made to 
pass before the mental vision of the child an interminable 
series of object-lessons, without the thought of developing 
that intelligence itself. 
205. Marzprancue (1638-1715). — We must not expect 
great pedagogical wisdom from a mystical dreamer and reso- 
lute idealist, who has imagined the vision of all things in 
God. Besides, Malebranche has given only a passing atten- 
tion to things relating to education. The member of a 
teaching congregation, the Oratory, he has not taught; and 
the whole effort of his mind was spent in the search for 
metaphysical truth. Nevertheless, it is interesting to stop
-P-A-G-E-225
PHILOSOPHERS OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY. 193 
for a moment this visionary who traverses the earth with 
eyes fixed on the heavens, and inquire of him what he 
thinks of the very practical question, education. 
206. Sense Instruction CONDEMNED. — Malebranche will 
reply to.us, with the prejudices of a metaphysician of thé 
idealist type, that the first thing to do is to nourish the child 
on abstract truths. In his view, souls have no age, so to 
speak, and the infant is already capable of ideal contempla- 
tion. Then jet sense instruction be abandoned, ‘ for this 
js the reason why children leave metaphysical thoughts, to 
apply themselves to sensations.” Is it objected that the 
child does not seem very well adapted to meditation on 
abstract truths? It is not so much the fault of nature, 
Malebranche will reply, as of the bad habits he has con- 
tracted. There is a means of remedying this ordinary inca- 
pacity of the child. 
‘If we kept children from fear, from desires, and from 
hope, if we did not make them suffer pain, if we removed 
them as far.as possible from their little pleasures, then we 
might teach them, from the moment they knew how to speak, 
the most difficult and the most abstract things, or at least the 
concreté mathematics, mechanics.” 
' Does Malebranche hope, then, to suppress, in the life of 
the’ child, pleasure and pain, and triumph over the tendencies 
which ordinary education has developed? 
‘‘ As an ambitious man who had just lost his fortune and 
his credit would not, be in a condition to resolve questions in 
metaphysics or equations in algebra, so children, on whose 
brains apples and sugar-plums make as profound impressions 
as are made on those of men of forty years by offices and 
titles, are not.in condition to hear the abstract truths that 
are taught them.” 
Consequetitly, we must declare war against the senses, and
-P-A-G-E-226
494 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
exclude, for example, all sorts of sensible rewards. Only, 
by a singular contradiction, Malebranche upholds material 
punishments in the education of children. ‘The only thing 
of sense he retains is the rod. 
207. Ineiuence of Materiat Environment. — Anothet 
contradiction more worthy of note is, that, notwithstanding his 
idealism, Malebranche believes in the influence of physical 
conditions on the development of the soul. He does not go 
so far as to say with the materialists of our time, that ‘* man 
is what he eats”; but he accords a certain amount of influ- 
ence to nourishment. ‘He speaks cheerfully of wine and of 
‘* those wild spirits who do not willingly submit to the orders 
of the will.” He never applied himself to work without hav- 
ing partaken of coffee. The soul, in his view, is not a force 
absolutely independent and isolated, which develops through 
an internal activity: ‘* we are bound,” he says, ‘* to every- 
thing, and stand in relations to all that surrounds us.’’ 
208. Locke (1632-1704).— Locke is above all else a. 
psychologist, an accomplished master in the art of analyzing 
the origin of ideas and the elements of the mental life. He 
is the head of that school of empirical psychology that rallies 
around its standard, Condillac in France, Herbart in Ger- 
many, and in Great Britain Hume and other Scotchmen, and 
1 Is not the antagonism pointed out by Malebranche more serious than 
M. Compayré seems to think? If the current of mental activity sets 
strongly towards the feelings, emotions, or senses, it is thereby diverted 
from the purely intellectual processes, such as reflection and judgment. 
The mind of the savage is an example of what comes from ‘‘ following the 
order of nature’? in an extreme training of the senses. On the nature and 
extent of this antagonism, the following anthorities may be consulted: 
Hamilton, Metaphysics, p. 336 ; Mansel, Metaphysics, pp: 68, 70, 77; Bain, 
The Senses and the Intellect, pp. 392-394 ; Bain, Xducation as a Sciencg 
pp. 17, 29, 37 ; Spencer, Principles of Psychology, pp. 98-99. (P.)
-P-A-G-E-227
PHILOSOPHERS OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY. 195 
the most of modern philosophers. But from psychology te 
pedagogy the transition is easy, and Locke had to make no 
great effort to become an authority in education after having 
been an accomplished philosopher. 
209. Some THougu7s on Epucation (1693).— The book 
which he published towards the close of his life, under the 
modest title Some Thoughts concerning Education, was the 
summing up of a long experience. A studious pupil at 
Westminster, he conceived from his early years, as Descartes 
did at La Fiéche, a keen sense of repugnance for a purely 
formal classical instruction, and for language studies in gen- 
eral, in which, nevertheless, he attained distinction. A 
model student at the University of Oxford, he there became 
an accomplished humanist, notwithstanding the practical and 
positive tendency of his mind that was already drawn to- 
wards the natural sciences and researches in physics and in 
medicine. Made Bachelor of Arts in 1656, and Master of Arts 
in 1658, he passed directly from the student’s bench to the 
_ professor’s chair. He was successively lecturer and tutor in 
Greek, but this did not prevent him later from eliminating 
Hellenism almost completely from his scheme of liberal educa- 
tion. Then he became lecturer on rhetoric, and finally on 
moral philosophy. When, in 1666, he discontinued his schol- 
astic life to mingle in political and diplomatic affairs, he at 
least carried from his studious residence at Oxford, the germs 
of the most of his ideas on education. He sought occasion to 
make an application of them in the education of private indi- 
viduals, of whom he was the inspirer and counsellor, if not the 
official director. In the families of friends and hosts that he 
frequented, for example, in that of Lord Shaftesbury, he made 
a close study of children; and it is in studying them, and in 
following with a sagacious eye the successive steps of their 
improvement in disposition and mind, that he succeeded in ~

196 | THE. HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
acquiring that educational experience which has left a trace 
on each page of the Thoughts concerning Education. This 
book, in fact, is the issue of one of Locke’s experiences as an 
assistant in the education of the children of his friends. 
Towards the year 1684-5, he addressed to his friend Clarke 
a series of letters which, retouched and slightly modified, 
have become a classical work, simple and familiar in style, 4 
little disconnected, perhaps, and abounding in - repetitions, 
but the substance of which is excellent, and the ideas as 
remarkable, in general, for their originality as for their just- 
ness. Translated into French in 1695 by P. Coste, and re- 
printed several times in the lifetime of their author, the 
Thoughts concerning Education have had a universal success. 
They have exercised an undoubted influence on the educa- 
tional writings of Rousseau and Helvetius. They have 
received the enthusiastic praise of Leibnitz, who placed this 
work above that on the Human Understanding. ‘‘I am 
persuaded,” said H. Marion recently, in his interesting study 
on Locke, ‘‘ that if an edition of the Thoughts were to be 
published to-day in a separate volume, it would have a 
marked success.” ! ,

211. Paystcaz Epucation; Tas HArpEnine Process. —~ 
The ideal of education, according to Locke, is ‘‘a sound 
mind in a sound body.’? A physician like Rabelais, the 
author of the Thoughts concerning Education had special 
competence in questions of physical education. But a love 
for the paradoxical, and an excessive tendency towards the 
hardening of the body, have marred, on this point, the re- 
flections of the English philosopher. He has summed up 
his precepts on this subject in the following lines : — 
‘The whole is reduced,” he says, ** to a small number of 
rules, easy to observe; much air, exercise, and sleep; a 
simple diet, no wine or strong liquors; little or no medicine 
atall; garments that are neither too tight nor too warm ; 
finally, and above all, the habit of keeping the head and feet 
cold, of often bathing the feet in cold water and exposing 
them to dampness.”! But it is necessary to enter some- 
what into detdils, and to examine closely some of these 
ideas. 
Locke is the first educator to write a consecutive and 
methodical dissertation on the food, clothing, and sleep of 
children. It is he who has stated this principle, afterwards 
taken up by Rousseau: ‘* Leave to nature the care of form- 
ing the body as she thinks it ought to be done.” Hence, no 
close-fitting garments, life in the open air, and in the sun; 
children brought up like peasants, inured to heat and cold, 
playing with head and feet bare. In the matter of food, 
Locke forbids sugar, wine, spices, and flesh, up to the age 
of three or four. As to fruits, which children often crave 
with an inordinate appetite, a fact that is not surprising, he 
pleasantly remarks, ‘ since it was for an apple that our first 
parents lost paradise,” he makes a singular ‘choice. He 
1 Thoughis, trarslation by G. Compayré, p. 57.
-P-A-G-E-230
198 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. - 
authorizes strawberries, gooseberries, apples, and pears ; but 
he interdicts peaches, plums, and grapes. To excuse Locke’s 
prejudice against the grapes, it must be recollected that he 
lived in England, a country in which the vine grows with 
difficulty, and of which an Italian said, ‘‘The only ripe fruit I 
have seen in England is a baked apple.” As to meals, 
Locke does not think it important to fix them at stated hours. 
Fénelon, on the contrary, more judiciously requires that the 
hour for repasts be absolutely determined. But this is not 
the only instance in which Locke’s wisdom is at fault. 
What shall be said of that hygienic fancy which consists in 
allowing the child ‘‘to have his shoes so thin, that they 
might leak and let in water, whenever he comes near it” ? , 
It is certain that Locke treats children with an unheard-of 
severity, all the more surprising in the case of one who had 
an infirm and delicate constitution that could be kept in 
repair only through precaution and management. I do not 
know whether the consequences of the treatment which he 
proposes, applied to the letter, might not be disastrous. 
Madame de Sévigné was more nearly right when she wrote : 
“If your son is very robust, a rude education is good; but 
if he is delicate, I think that in your attempts to make him 
robust, you would kill him.” The body, says Locke, may be 
accustomed to everything. We may reply to this by quoting 
an anecdote of Peter the Great, who one day took it into his 
head, it is said, that it would be best for all the sailors to 
form the habit of drinking salt water. Immediately he pro- 
mulgated an edict which ordered that all naval cadets should 
henceforth drink only sea-water. The boys all died, and 
there the experiment stopped. 
Still, without subscribing to Locke’s paradoxes, which 
have found no one to approve of them except Rousseau, we 
should recollect that in his precepts on physical education as
-P-A-G-E-231
PHILOSOPHERS OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY. 199 , 
a whole, the author of the Thoughts deserves oir: contin if | f 
tion for having recommended a manly course of: . siseipline, 
and a frugal diet, for having discarded fashionable conven- 
vionalities and drawn near to nature, and for! having con- 
demned the refinements of an indolent mode of lita, pnd for 
being inspired by the simple and manly customs of England. aoe 
212. Moray Epvcation. — In the thought of’ Locke, moral 
education takes precedence of instruction properly'so called : 
‘“‘That which a gentleman ought to desire for his’ son. 
besides the fortune he leaves him is, 1. virtue; 2. prudence, 
3. good manners; 4. instruction.” 
Virtue and prudence — that is, moral qualities and. prac- 
tical qualities —are of first consideration. ‘‘ Instruction,” 
says Locke again, ‘‘is but the least part of education.” In 
the book of Thoughts, where repetitions abound, there is 
nothing more frequently repeated than the praise of virtue. 
Doubtless it may be thought that Locke, like Herbert 
Spencer in our own day, cherishes prejudices with respect to 
instruction, and that he does not take sufficient account of 
the moralizing influence exercised over the heart and will by 
intellectual enlightenment; but, even with this admission, we 
must thank Locke for having protested against the teachers’ 
who think they have done all when they have embellished the © 
memory and developed the intelligence. 
The grand thing in education is certainly to establish good 
moral habits, to. cultivate noble sentiments, and, finally, to 
form virtuous characters. 
213. Honor, rae Privcrete or Mora Discreuine. — 
But after having placed moral education in its proper rank, 
which is the first, is remains to inquire what shall be the 
principles and the methods. of this education. Shall it be 
the maxim of utility, as Rousseau requires? Must the child,
-P-A-G-E-232
\ 200 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
before acting, inquire what is the good of this? Cut bono? 
No ;- utilitarian in instruction and in intellectual education, as 
we have just seen, Locke is not so in moral education. 
Shall it be fear, shall it be the authority of the. teacher or of 
parents, founded on punishments, upon the slavish feeling 
of terror?: Still less. Locke reproves repressive discipline, 
and is not inclined to chastisements. Shall it be affection, 
the love of. parents, the aggregate of tender sentiments? 
Locke scarcely speaks of them. Of too little sensibility him- 
self, he does not seem to think of all that can be done through 
the sensibility of the child. 
Locke, who perhaps is wrong in treating the child too 
early, as though he were a man, who does not take sufficient 
~ account of all the feebleness that is in infant nature, appeals 
from the first to the sentiment of honor, and to the fear of 
shame, that is, to emotions which, I fear, by their very 
nobleness, are above the powers of the child. Honor, which 
is, in fact, but another name for duty, and the ordimary 
synonym of virtue, — honor may assuredly be the guide of 
an adult and already trained conscience; but is it not chi- 
merical to hope that the child, from his earliest years, will be 
sensible to the esteem or the contempt of those who surround 
“him? If it were possible to inspire a child with a regard for 
his reputation, I grant with Locke that we might henceforth 
‘* make of him whatever we will, and teach him to love all 
the forms of virtue”; but the question is to know whether 
we can succeed in this, and I doubt it, notwithstanding the 
assurances of Locke. 
Kant has very justly said: — 
“Jt is labor lost to speak of duty to children. They com- 
prehend it only as a thing whose transgression is followed by 
the ferule. ... So one ought not to try to call into play with 
shildren the feeling of shame, but to wait for this till the
-P-A-G-E-233
PHILOSOPHERS OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY. 201 
period of. youth comes. In fact, it cannot be developed in 
them till the idea of honor has already taken root there.” 
Locke is the dupe of the same illusion, both when he 
expects of the child enough moral power so that the sense of 
honor suffices to govern him, and when he counts enough ‘on 
his intellectual forces to desire to reason with him from the 
moment he knows how to speak. For forming good habits 
in the child, and preparing him for a life of virtue, there is 
full need of all the resources that nature and art put at the 
disposal of the educator, — sensibility under all its forms, 
the calculations of self-interest, the lights of the intelligence. 
It is only little by little, and with the progress of age, that 
an exalted principle, like the sentiment of honor or the senti- 
ment of duty, will be able to emerge from out the mobile 
hamors of the child, and dominate his actions like a sovereign 
law. The moral pedagogy of Locke is certainly faulty in that 
it is not. sufficiently addressed to the heart, and.to the 
potency of loving, which is already so great in the child. I 
add, that in his haste to emancipate the child, to treat him as 
a reasonable creature, and to develop in him the principles 
of self-government, Locke was wrong in proscribing almost 
absolutely the fear of punishment. It is good to respect the 
liberty and the dignity of the man that is in the child, but it 
is not necessary that this respect degenerate into supersti- 
tion ; and itis not sure that to train firm and robust wills, it 
is necessary to have them early affranchised from all fear 
and all constraint. . 
214. Conpemnation or CorroraL PuntsoMent. —It is 
undeniable that Locke has not sufficiently enlarged the bases 
of his theory of moral discipline ; but if he has rested incom- 
plete in the positive part of his task, if he has not advised 
all that should be done, he has been more successful in the
-P-A-G-E-234
202 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
negative part, that which consists in eliminating all that 
ought not to be done. The chapters devoted to punishments 
in general, and in particular to corporal punishments, count 
among the best in the Thoughts. Rollin and Rousseau have 
often copied from them. It is true that Locke himself has 
borrowed the suggestion of them from Montaigne. The 
“severe mildness” which is the pedagogical rule of the 
author of the Essays, is also the rule of Locke. It is in 
accordance with this that Locke has brought to bear on the 
rod the final judgment of good sense: ‘ The rod isa slavish 
discipline, which makes a slavish temper.” He has yielded 
to the ideas of his time on only one point, when he admits 
one exception to the absolute interdiction of the rod, and 
tolerates its use in extreme cases to overcome the obstinate 
and rebellious resistance of the child. This is going too far 
without. any doubt; but to do justice to the boldness of* 
Locke’s views, we must consider how powerful the custom 
then was, and still is, in England, in a country where the 
heads of institutions think themselves obliged to notify the 
public, in the advertisements published in the journals, that 
the interdiction of corporal punishment counts among ‘the 
advantages of their schools. ‘‘It is difficult to conceive 
the perseverance with which English teachers cling to the old 
and degrading customs of gorrections by the rod.... A 
more astonishing thing is that the scholars séem to hold to it 
as much as the teachers.” ‘‘In 1818,” relates one of the 
former pupils of Charterhouse, ‘‘ our head master, Doctor 
Russell, who had ideas of his own, resolved to abolish 
corporal punishment and substitute for it a fine. Everybody 
resisted the innovation. The rod seemed to us perfectly 
consistent with the dignity of a gentleman; but a fine, for 
shame! The school rose to the ery: ‘Down with the fine! 
Long live the rod!’ The revolt triumphed, and the rod was
-P-A-G-E-235
PHILOSOPHERS OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY. 203 
solemnly restored. ‘Then we were glad-hearted over the 
affair. On the next day after the fine was abolished, we 
found, on entering the class-room, a superb forest of birches, 
and the two hours of the session were conscientiously em- 
ployed in making use of them.” »? 
215. InteLtectuaL Epucation. — In what concerns intel- 
lectual education, Locke manifestly belongs to the school, 
small in his time, but more and more numerous to-day, of 
utilitarian teachers. He would train, not men of letters, or 
of science, but practical men, armed for the battle of life, pro- 
vided with all the knowledge they will need in order to Keep 
their accounts, administer their fortune, satisfy th the Tequire- 
ments 6f their profession, and, finally, to fulfill their duties as 
men atid citizens. Ina word, he wrote for a nation of trades- 
men and citizens. ~ 
“O16. ‘Unuranran Srupres. — An undeniable merit of 
Locke is that of having reacted against a purely formal in- 
struction, which substitutes for the acquisition of positive 
and real knowledge a superfluous culture, so to speak, a 
training in a superficial rhetoric and an elegant verbiage. 
Locke disdains and condemns studies that do not contribute 
directly toa preparation for life. Doubtless he goes a little

2 On the question of corporal punishment in school, is not M. Compayré 
too absolate in his assumptions? On what principle does he base his 
absolute condemnation of the rod? What is to be done in those cases of 
revolt against order and decency that occur from time to time in most 
schools? There is no doubt that the very best teachers can govern without 
resorting to this hateful expedient ; but what shall be done in extreme cases 
by the multitude who are not, and never can be, teachers of this ideal 
type? Nor does this question stand alone. Below, it is related to family 
discipline ; and above, to civil administration. If corporal punishment is 
‘nterdicted in the school, should it not be interdicted in the State? (P.)
-P-A-G-E-236
204 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
too far in his reaction against the current formalism and in 
his predilection for realism. He is too forgetful of the fact 
that the old classical studies, if not useful in the positive 
sense of the term, and not satisfying the ordinary needs of 
existence, have yet a higher utility, in the sense that they 
may become, in skillful and discreet hands, an excellent 
instrument for intellectual discipline and the education of the 
judgment. But Locke spoke to fanatics and pedants, for 
whom Latin and Greek were the whole of instruction, and 
who, turning letters from their true purpose, wrongly made 
a knowledge of the dead languages the sole end, and not,.as 
should be the case, one of the means of instruction. Locke 
is by no means 2 blind utilitarian, a coarse positivist, who 
dreams of absolutely abolishing disinterested studies. He 
wishes merely to put them in their place, and to guard against , 
investing them with a sort of exclusive privilege, and against 
sacrificing to them other branches of instruction that are 
more essential and more immediately useful. 
_ 217. Programme or Srupims.—As soon as the child 
knows how to read and write, he should be taught to draw. 
Very disdainful of painting and of the fine arts in general, 
whose benign and profound influence on the souls of children 
his colder nature has not sufficiently recognized, Locke, by 
way of compensation, recommends drawing, because drawing 
may be practically useful, and he puts it on almost the same 
footing as reading and writing. 
These elements once acquired, the child should be drilled 
in the mother tongue, first in reading, and afterwards in 
exercises in composition, in brief narratives, in familiar 
letters, etc. The study of a living language (Locke recom- 
mends French to his countrymen) should immediately follow ; 
and it is only after this has been acquired that the child shall 
be put to the study of Latin. Save the omission of th¢
-P-A-G-E-237
PHILOSOPHERS OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY. 205 
sciences, Locke’s plan is singularly like that which for ten 
years has been in use in the French lycées. 
As to Latin, which follows the living language, Locke 
requires that it shall be learned above all through use, 
through conversation if a master can, be found who speaks 
it fluently, but if not, through the reading of authors. As 
little of grammar as possible, no memoriter exercises, no 
Latin composition, either in prose or verse, but, as soon 
as possible, the reading of easy Latin texts, — these are the 
recommendations of Locke that have been too little heeded. 
The purpose is no longer to learn Latin for the sake of 
writing it elegantly ; the only purpose truly desirable is to 
comprehend the authors who have written in that language. 
The obstinate partisans of Latin verse and conversation will 
not read without chagrin these earnest protests of Locke 
against exercises that have been too much abused, and that 
impose on the learner the torment of writing in a language 
which he handles with difficulty, upon subjects which he but 
imperfectly understands. As to Greek, Locke proscribes it 
absolutely: He does not disparage the beauty of a language 
whose masterpieces, he says, are the original source. of our 
literature and science; but he reserves the knowledge of it 
to the learned, to the lettered, to professional scholars, and 
he excludes it from secondary instruction, which ought to be 
‘but the school which trains for active life. Thus relieved, 
classical instruction will more easily welcome the studies that 
are of real use and of practical application, — geography, 
which Locke places in the first rank, because it is ‘an exercise 
of the eyes and memory ” ; arithmetic, which ‘is of so general 
use in all parts of life and business, that scarce anything can 
be done without it”; then what he somewhat ambitiously 
calls astronomy, and which is in reality an elementary cos- 
mography ; the parts of geometry which are necessary for
-P-A-G-E-238
206 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
‘a, man of business”; chronology and history, ‘‘ the most 
agreeable and the mos. instructive of studies” ; ethics and 
common law, which do not yet have a place in French pro- 
grammes ; finally, natural philosophy, that is, the physical 
sciences; and, to crown all, a manual trade and book- 
keeping. 
218. -Artractive Srupres.— Another characteristic of 
Locke’s intellectual discipline is, that, utilitarian in its pur- 
pose, the instruction which he organizes shall be attractive 
in its methods. After hatred for the pedantry which use- 
Jessly spends the powers of the learner in barren studies, the 
next strongest antipathy of Locke is that which is inspired 
by the rigor of a too didactic system of instruction, where 
the methods are repulsive, the processes painful, and where 
the teacher appears to his pupils only as a bugbear and a 
marplot. 
Although he may go to extremes in this, he is partly right 
in wishing to bring into favor processes that are inviting and 
methods that are attractive. Without hoping, as he does, 
without desiring even, that the pupil may come to make no 
distinction between study and other diversions, we are dis- 
posed to believe that something may be done to alleviate for 
him the first difficulties in learning, to entice and captivate 
him without constraining him, and, finally, to spare him the 
disgust which cannot fail to be inspired by studies too 
severely forced upon him, and which are made the subject 
of scourges and scoldings. It is especially for reading and 
the first exercises of the child that Locke recommends the 
use of instructive plays. ‘‘ They may be taught to read, 
without, perceiving it to be anything but a sport, and play 
themselves into that which others are whipped for.” 
_ Children of every age are jealous of their independence 
and eager for pleasure. No one before Locke had so clearly
-P-A-G-E-239
PHILOSOPHERS OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY. 207 
recognized the néed of the activity and liberty which are 
natural to the child, or so strongly insisted on the necessity 
of respecting his independent disposition and his personal 
tastes. Here again English pedagogy of the seventeenth 
century meets its illustrious successor of the. nineteenth. 
Herbert Spencer has thoroughly demonstrated the fact that 
the mind really appropriates only the knowledge that affords 
it pleasure and agreeable exercise. Now, there is pleasure 
and agreeable excitation wherever there is the development 
of a normal activity corresponding to an instinctive taste 
and proportioned to the natural powers of the child; and 
there is no real instruction save at the expense of a real 
display of activity.! 
219. SHoutp THERE BE Learninc sy Hearr?—To this 
question, Should there be learning by heart? Locke gives a 
resolute reply in the negative. The conclusion is absolute 
and false; but the premises that he assumes to justify his 
conclusion are, if possible, falser still. Locke sets out from 
this psychological idea, that the memory is not susceptible 
of progress. He brings into the discussion his sensualistic 
prejudices, his peculiar conception of the soul, which is . 
    
1 It is usually said that a pupil’s distaste fora study indicates one of 
two things, either the mode of presenting the subject is bad, or it is pre- 
sented at an unseasdnable period of mental development ; but this distaste 
is quite as likely to be due to the fact that a certain mode of mental activity 
has not yet been established ; for until fairly established, its exercise can- 
not be pleasurable. The assumption that intellectual appetites alréady 
exist and are waiting to be gratified, or that they will invariably appear at 
certain periods of tental development, is by no means a general law of 
the mental life. In many cases, these appetites must be created, and it 
may often be that the studies employed for this purpose may not at first 
be relished. And there are cases where, under the best of skill, this - 
relish may never come; and still, the knowledge or the discipline is 
so necessaty that the studies may be enforced contrary to the pupil's 
pleasure. (P.) .

208 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
but atabula rasa, an empty and inert capacity, and not a con- 
geries of energies and of living forces that are strengthened 
by exercise.. -He does not believe that the faculties, what- 
ever they may be, can grow and develop, and this for the 
good reason, according to his thinking, that the faculties 
have no existence. 
. But here let him speak for himself : — 
‘¢T hear it is said that children should be employed in get- 
ting things by heart, to exercise and improve their memories. 
I would wish this were said with as much authority and 
reason as it is with forwardness of assurance, and that this 
practice were established upon good observation more than 
old custom. For it is evident that strength of memory is 
owing to an happy constitution, and not to any habitual 
improvement got by exercise. ’Tis trie what the mind is 
intent upon, and, for fear of letting it slip, often imprints 
afresh on itself by frequent reflection, that it is apt to retain, 
but still according to its own natural strength of retention. 
An impression made on beeswax or lead will not last so 
long as on brass or steel. Indeed, if it be renewed often, it 
may last the longer; but every new reflecting on it is a new 
- impression, and ’tis from thence one is to reckon, if one 
would know how long the mind retains it, But the learning 
pages of Latin by heart no more fits the memory for reter- 
tion of anything, else, than the graving of one sentence in 
lead makes it the more capable of retaining firmly any other 
characters.” 1 
If Locke were right, education would become wholly im- 
possible ; for, in case of all the faculties, education supposes 
the existence of a natural germ which exercise fertilizes and 
develops.

220. A Trips sHOULD BE LEARNED. — Locke, like Rous- 
seau, but for other reasons, wishes his pupil to learn a trade: 
‘sT can not forbear to say, I would have my gentleman 
learn a trade, @ manual trade; nay, two or three, but one 
more particularly.” 1 
Rousseau will say the same: ‘ Recollect that it is. not 
talent that I require of you; it is a trade, areal trade, a purely 
mechanical art, in which the hands work more than the head.” 
But Locke, in having his gentleman learn .carpentry or 
agriculture, especially designed that this physical labor should 
lend the mind a diversion, an occasion for relaxation and 
repose, and secure to the body a useful exercise. Rousseau 
is influenced by totally different ideas. What he wants is, 
first, that through an apprenticeship to a trade, Emile may 
protect himself against need in case a revolutionary crisis 
should deprive him of his wealth. In the second place, 
Rousseau obeys his social, we might even say his socialistic, 
preoccupations. Work, in his view, is a strict duty, from 
which no one can exempt himself. ‘Rich or ‘poor, every 
idle citizen is a knave.” 
221. Worxine Scnoors, — Although Locke is almost 
exclusively preoccupied with classical studies and with a 
gentleman’s education, nevertheless he has not remained 
completely a stranger to questions of primary instruction. 
In 1697 he addressed to the English government a remark- 
able document on the importance of organizing “ working 
schools” for the children of the poor. All children over 
three and under fourteen years of age are to be collected in 
homes where they will find labor and food. In this way 
Locke thought to contend against immorality and pauperism. 
He would find a remedy for the idleness and vagabondage of

the. child, and lighten the care of the mother who is abs: 
in her work. He would also, through habits of ordei 
_ discipline, train up steady men and industrious workmen. 
other terms, he attempted a work of social regeneration, an 
the tutor of gentlemen became the educator of the poor. 
222. Locke anp Rovusseau.—In the Emile we shal 
frequently find passages inspired by him whom Rousseau 
calls ‘* the wise Locke.” Perhaps we shall admire even more 
the practical qualities and the good sense of the En I 
educator when we shall have become acquainted wit 
chimeras of his French imitator. In the case of Locke, we 
have to do, not with an author who wishes to shine, but with 
a man of sense and judgment who expresses his opinions, 
and who has no other pretense than to understand himself and 
to be comprehended by others. To appreciate the Thoughts 
at their full value, they should not be read till after having 
re-read the Emile, which is so much indebted to th: 
coming frofn the reading of Rousseau, after the 
glare and almost the giddiness occasioned his reaucs wy a 
writer of genius whose imagination is ever on the wing, 
whose passion urges him on, and who mingles with so many 
exalted truths, hasty paradoxes, and noisy declamations, it 
is like repose and a delicious unbending to the spirit to go 
to the study of Locke, and to find a train of thought always 
equable, a style simple and dispassionate, an author always 
master of himself, always correct, notwithstanding some 
errors, and a book, finally, filled, not with flashes and smoke, 
but with a light that is agreeable and pure.

religious, scientific, and social, that happen to be in the 
ascendent; and also the tendency of the human mind to 
adopt extreme views. , 
2. The subjective tendency of human thought is typified 
by the Socratic philosophy, and the objective. tendency by 
the Baconian philosophy ; and from these twe. main sources 
have issued two distinctive schools of educators, the formal- 
ists and the realists, the first holding that the main purpose 
of education is discipline, training, or formation, and the 
other, that this. purpose is furnishing instruction or informa- 
tion. This, line is distinctly drawn in the seventeenth 
century, and the two: schools are typified. by, Malebranche 
and Locke. |

classical studies, in the effort to convert study into a diver- 
sion, in the use of milder means of discipline, and. in the 
importance. attached to useful studies. In, these. particulars 
the reaction of the sixteenth century is. intensified.]

224, Tue Epvucation or Women 1N THE SEVENTEENTH 
Century. — The Education of Girls of Fénelon has shown us 
how far the spirit of the seventeenth century was able to go 
in what concerns the education of women, as exhibited in 
the most liberal theories on the subject; but in practice, 
save in brilliant exceptions, even the modest and imperfect 
ideal of Fénelon was far from being attained. 
Chrysale was not-alone of this opinion, when he said in 
the Learned Ladies : — 
kK “It is not very proper, and for several reasons, that a 
wi oman should study and know so many things. To train the 
minds of her children in good morals and manners, to super- 
intend her household, by keeping an eye on her servants, 
and to control the expenditures with economy, ought to be

her study and philosophy.”? It is true that Molitre himself 
did not sympathize with the prejudices whose expression he 
put in the mouth of his comic character, and that he con- 
cludes that a woman ‘‘ may be enlightened on every subject” 
(‘* Je consens qu’une femme ait des clartés de tout”). But 
in real fact and in practice, it is the opinion of Chrysale 
that prevailed. Even in the higher classes, woman held 
herself aloof from instruction, and from things intellectual. 
Madame Racine had never seen played, and had probably 
never read, the tragedies of her husband. 
225. Mapame pr Siviens. — However, the seventeent 
century was not wanting in women of talent or genius, whu 
might have made an eloquent plea in behalf of their sex ; but 
they were content to give personal examples of a high order, 
without any anxiety to be imitated. Madame de Lafayette 
made beautiful translations from Latin; Madame Dacier 
was a humanist of the first order; and Madame de Sévigné 
knew the modern languages as well as the ancient. No one 
has better described the advantage of reading. She recom- 
mends the reading of romances in the following terms : — 
“«T found that a young man became generous and brave 
‘in seeing my heroes, and that a girl became genteel and wise 
in reading Cleopatra. There are occasionally some who take 
things somewhat amiss, but they would perhaps do scarcely 
‘any better if they could not read.” ? 
Madame de Sévigné had her daughter read Descartes, and 
her granddaughter Pauline, the tragedies of Corneille.’ 
“For my part,” she said, ‘if I were to bring ip my 
granddaughter, I would have her read what is good, but not 
too simple. I would reason with her.” * ‘

214 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
226. Tux Assi Fieury.— But Madame de Sévigné and 
Madame de Grignan were but brilliant exceptions, If one 
were to doubt the ignorance of the women of this period, it 
would suffice to read this striking passage from the Abbé 
Fleury, the assistant of Fénelon in the education of the 
Duke of Bourgogne : — 
‘This, doubtless, will be a great paradox, that; women 
ought to learn anything else than their catechism, sewing, 
and different little pieces of work, singing, dancing, and 
dressing in the fashion, and to make a fine courtesy. As 
things now go, this constitutes all their education.” ? 
ly Fleury desires something else for woman. He demands 
that she learn to write correctly in French, and that she 
study logic and arithmetic. But we need not fear lest the 
liberalism of a thinker of the seventeenth century carry him 
too far. ° Fleury admits, for example, that history is abso- 
lately useless to women. 
227. Epucation In THE Coxvents. —It is almost exclu- 
sively in convents that young girls then received what 
passed for an education. The religions congregations that 
devoted themselves to female education were numberless; 
we note, for example, among the most celebrated, the Ursu- 
lines, founded in 1537; the Association of the Angelics, 
established in Italy in 1536; and the Order of Saint Eliza- 
beth. But, notwithstanding the diversity of names, all the 
convents for girls resemble one another. In all of them 
woman was educated for heaven, or for a life of devotion. 
Spiritual exercises formed the only occupation of the pupils, 
and study was scarcely taken into account.

EDUCATION OF WOMEN. | Beat 
of the eonvents. of the seventeenth century is to read the 
Regulations for Children, written towards 1657 by Jacqueline 
Paseal, Sister Saint Euphemia. The education of girls 
interested the. Jansenists not less than the education of 
men; but in this respect, Port Royal is far from deserving 
the same encomiums in both cases. 
229. GeneraL Impression. — There is nothing so sombre 
and sad as the interior of their institution for girls, and 
nothing so austere as the rules of Jacqueline Pascal. 
‘A strange emotion, even at the distance of centuries, . 
is caused by the sight of those children keeping silent or 
speaking in a whisper from rising till retiring, never walking 
except between two nuns, one in front and the other behind, 
in order to, make it impossible, by slackening their pace on 
the pretext of some indisposition, for them to hold any com- 
munication ; working in such a way as never to be in com- 
panies of two or three; passing from meditation to prayer, 
and from prayer to instruction; learning, besides the cate- 
chism, nothing but reading and writing; and, on Sunday, 
‘a little arithmetic, the older from one to, two o’clock, and 
the younger from two to half past two’; the hands always 
busy to prevent the mind from wandering; but without 
being able to become attached to their work, which would 
please God as much the more as it pleased themselves the 
less; opposing all their natural inclinations, and despising 
the attentions due the body ‘destined to serve as food for 
worms’; doing nothing, in a word, except in the spirit of 
mortification, Imagine those days of fourteen and sixteen 
hours, slowly succeeding one another, and weighing down 
on the heads of those poor little sisters, for six or eight 
years in that dreary solitude, where there was nothing te 
bring in, the stir of life, save the sound of the bell announc-

ing a change of exercise or of penance, and-you will com. 
prehend Fénelon’s feeling of sadness when he speaks of the 
shadows of that deep cavern in which was imprisoned and, 
as it were, buried the youth of girls.”* 
230. Srverrry anp Love. — The severity of the Regula- 
tions is such that the editor, M. de Pontchartrain, also a 
Jansenist, allows that it will be impossible to obtain from 
all children ‘‘so complete a silence and so formal a life” 
and requires that the mistresses shall try to gain their affec- 
tions. Love must be united with severity. Jacqueline 
Pascal does not seem to be entirely of this opinion, since 
she declares that only God must be loved. “However, not- 
withstanding her habitual severity, human tenderness some- 
times asserts its rights in the rules which she established. 
We feel that she loves more than she confesses, those young 
girls whom she calls ‘‘little doves.” On the one hand, 
the Regulations incite the pupils to eat of what is placed 
before them indifferently, and to begin with what they like 
the least, through a spirit of penitence; but, o: 
hand, Jacqueline writes: ‘‘ They must be exhor 
sufficient nourishment so as not to allow the 
become weakened, and this is why care is take: 
have eaten: enough.” And so there is a touchin, 
that is almost maternal in this remark: ‘As s) 
have retired, each particular bed must be visil__ — 
whether all proprieties have been observed, and whether the 
children are well covered in winter.” The mystic sister of 
‘the ascetic Pascal has moments of tenderness. ‘* Never- 
theless, we must not cease to feel pity for them, and to 
accommodate ourselves to them in every way that 
but without letting them know that we have thu:

scended.” However, the dominant conception ever reap- 
pearing, is the idea that human nature is evil; that we have 
to do with rebellious spirits which must be conquered, and 
that they deserve no commiseration. 
There is a deal of anxiety to make study agreeable! 
Jacqueline directs her pupils to work at the very things that 
are most repulsive, because the work that will please God 
the most is that which will please them the least. The 
exterior manifestations of friendship are forbidden, and 
possibly friendship itself. ‘‘ Our pupils shall shun every sort 
of familiarity one towards another.” 
Instruction is reduced to the catechism, to the application 
of the Christian virtues, to reading, and to writing. Arith- 
metic is not taught save on holidays. It seems that memory 
is the only faculty that Jacqueline wishes to have developed. 
“This, opens their minds, gives them occupation, and keeps 
them from evil thoughts.” Have we not reason to say that 
at Port Royal women have less value than men! Whata 
distance between the solid instruction of Lancelot’s and 
Nicole’s pupils and the ignorance of Jacqueline Pascal’s! 
Even when the men of Port Royal speak of the education 
of women, they have more liberal ideas than those which are 
applied at their side. Nicole declares that books are neces- 
sary even in convents for girls, because it is necessary ‘to 
sustain prayer by reading.” 
281. Genera, Cuaracter or Saint Cyr.—In leaving 
Port Royal for Saint Cyr, we seem, on coming out of a 
profound night, to perceive a ray of light. Without doubt, 
Madame de Maintenon has not yet, as a teacher, all that 
breadth of view that could be desired. Her work is far - 
from being faultless, but the founding of Saint Cyr (1686) 
was none the less a considerable innovation. ‘+ Saint Cyz,” 
It has been said, ‘‘is not a convent. It is a great establish:
-P-A-G-E-250
218 THE. HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY, 
ment devoted to the lay education of young women of 
noble birth; it is a bold and intelligent secularization of the 
education of women.” There is some excess of praise in 
this statement, and the lay character of Saint Cyr is very 
questionable. Lavallée, an admirer, could write: ‘‘The 
instructions of Madame de Maintenon are. doubtless too 
religious, too monastic.” Let us grant, however, that 
Madame de Maintenon, who, after having founded Saint 
. Cyr, was the director of it, extra muros, and even taught 
there, at stated times, is personally the first lay teacher of 
France. Let us grant, also, that at least in the beginning, 
and up to 1692, the women entrusted with the work of 
instruction were not nuns in the absolute sense of the.term. 
They were not bound by solemn and absolute vows. 
But this character relatively laic, and. this rupture with 
monastic. traditions, were not maintained during the whole 
life of the institution. 
282. Two Prrrops in rae History or Sarr Cyr. ~~ 
Saint Cyr, in fact, passed, within a few years, through two 
very different.periods, and Madame de Maintenon followed 
in succession two. almost opposite currents. For the first 
years, from 1686 to 1692, the spirit of the institution is 
broad and liberal; the education is brilliant, perhaps too 
much so; literary exercises and dramatic representations 
have an honored place. Saint Cyr is an institution inclining 
to worldliness, better fitted to train women of" intellect than 
good economists and housewives. Madame de Maintenon 
quickly saw that she had taken a false route, and, from 
1692, she reacted, not without excess, against the.tendencies 
which she had at first obeyed. She conceived an extreme 
distrust of literary studies, and cut off all she could from the 
instruction, in order to give her entire thought to the moral 
and practical qualities of her pupils. Saint Cyr became a

eonvent, with 4 little more liberty, doubtless, than there was 
m the other monasteries of the time, but it was a convent 
still. 
233. Dramatic REPRESENTATIONS. — It was the notorious 
success of the performance of Andromaque and Esther that 
caused the overthrow of the original intentions of Madame 
de Maintenon. Zsther, in particular, was the great event 
of the first years of Saint Cyr. Racine distributed the 
parts; Boileau conducted the training in elocution; and the 
entire Court, the king at the head, came to applaud and 
entertain the pretty actresses, who left nothing undone to 
please their spectators. Heads were a little turned by all 
this; dissipation crept into the school. The pupils were 
no longer willing to sing in church, for fear of spoiling their 
voices. - Evidently the route was now over a dangerous 
declivity. ‘The institution had been turned from its purpose. 
Matters were in a way to establish, under another form, 
another Hétel de Rambouillet.? 
234. Rerorm or 1692. — At the first, as we have seen, 
the ladies of Saint Louis, charged with the direction of Saint 
Cyr, did not found a monastic order properly so-called ; but, 
when Madame de Maintenon resolved to reform the general 
spirit of the house, she thought it necessary to transform 
Saint Cyr into a monastery, and she founded the Order of 
Saint Augustine. . 
  
1* The name generally given to a social cirele, which for more than half 
a century gathered around Catherine de Vivonne, marquise de Rambouillet, 
and her daughter, Julie d’Angennes, duchess de Montausier, and which 
oxercised a very conspicuous influence on French language, literature, and 
rivilization.... Her house soon became the place where all who had 
genius, wit, learning, talent, or taste, assembled, and from these reunions 
originated the French Academy, the highest authority of French literature. 
and the salons, the most prominent feature of French civilization.”

220 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
But what she changed in particular was the moral dis- 
cipline, and the programme of studies. 
Madame de Maintenon has herself recited, in a memorable 
letter,! the reasons of that reform which modified so pro- 
foundly the character of Saint Cyr: — 
‘¢ The sorrow I feel for the girls of Saint Cyr,” she said, 
“can be cured only by time and by an entire change in the 
education that we have given them up to this hour. It is 
very just that I should suffer for this, since I have contri- 
buted to it more than any one else. ... The whole establish- 
ment has been the object of ‘my pride, and the ground for 
this feeling has been so real that it has gone to extremes that 
I never intended.’ God knows that I wished to establish 
yirtue at Saint Cyr, but I have built upon the sand. Not 
having, what alone can make a solid foundation, I wished 
the girls to be witty, high-spirited, and trained to think; I 
have succeeded in this purpose. They have wit, and they 
use it against us. They are high-spirited, and are more 
heady and haughty than would be becoming in a royal 
princess. Speaking after the manner of the world, we have 
trained their reason, and have made them talkative, pre- 
sumptuous, inquisitive, bold . . . witty, — such characters as 
even we who have trained them cannot abide.... Let us 
seek a remedy, for we must not be discouraged.... As 
many little things form pride, many little things will destroy 
it. Our girls have been treated with too much consideration, 
have been petted too much, treated too gently. We must 
now leave them more to themselves in their class-rooms, 
make them observe the daily regulations, and speak to them 
of scarcely anything else. .... Pray to God, and ask Him to 
change their hearts; and that He may give to all of them

humility. There should not be much conversation with them 
on the subject. Everything at Saint Cyr is made a matter or 
discourse. We often speak of simplicity, and try to define 
it correctly . . . and yet, in practice, the girls make merry in 
saying: ‘ Through simplicity I take the best place; through 
simplicity I am going to commend myself.’ Our girls must 
be cured of that jesting turn of mind which I have given 
them. ... We have wished to shun the pettiness of certain 
convents, and God has punished us for this haughty spirit. 
There is no house in the world that has more need of humility 
within and without than our own. Its situation near the 
Court; the air of favor that pervades it; the favors of a 
great King; the offices of a person of consideration, —- all 
these snares, so full of danger, should lead us to take meas- 
ures directly contrary to those we have really taken... .” 
235. Tue Part pLavep By Mapamy pe Marnrenon. — 
Whatever may be the opinion respecting the tone of the edu- 
eational work at Saint Cyr, there cannot be the least doubt 
as to the admirable zeal of Madame de Maintenon, and her 
indefatigable devotion to the success of her favorite under- 
taking. The vocation of the teacher was evidently hers. 
For more than thirty years, from 1686 to 1717, she did not 
cease to visit Saint Cyr every day, sometimes at six in the 
morning. She wrote for the directresses and for the pupils 
counsels and regulations that fill several volumes. Nothing 
which concerns ‘‘ her children” is a matter of indifference to 
her. She devotes her attention to their meals, their sleep, 
their toilet, as well as to their character and their instruc- 
tion: — : 
‘‘ The affairs we discuss at Court are bagatelles; those at 
Saint Cyr are the more important. ...” ‘May that establish- 
ment last as long as France, and France as long-as the world. 
Nothing is dearer to-me than my children of Saint Cyr.”
-P-A-G-E-254
222 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
It is not tenderness, it is well known, that characterizes | 
the soul of Madame de Maintenon; but, at Saint Cyr;-from 
being formal and cold, which is her usual state, she becomes 
loving and tender:— | * 
“Forget nothing that may save the sduls of our young 
girls, that may fortify their health and preserve their form.” 
One day, as she had come to the school, as her custom was, 
to consult with the nuns, a company of girls passed by raising 
a cloud of dust. The nuns, fearing that Madame de Main- 
tenon was annoyed by it, requested them to withdraw. 
‘Pray, let the dear girls be,” replied Madame de Main- 
tenon; ‘‘I love them even to the dust they raise.” Con- 
versely, as it were, the pupils of Pestalozzi, consulted on 
the question of knowing whether they were willing always to 
be beaten and clawed by their old master, replied affirm- 
atively: they loved him even to his claws! 
236. Her PrepacocicaL Wrrrinas. —It is only in our 
day that the works of Madame de Maintenon have been 
published in the integrity of their text, thanks to the labors 
of Théophile Lavallée. For the most part, these long and 
interesting letters are devoted to education and to Saint Cyr. 
These are, first, the Letters and Conversations on the Educa- 
tion of Girls. These letters were written from day to day, 
and are addressed, sometimes to the ladies of Saint Cyr, and 
sometimes to the pupils themselves. ‘‘ We find in them,” 
says Lavallée, ‘‘ for all circumstances and for all times, the 
most solid teaching, masterpieces of good sense, of natural- 
ness, and of truth, and, finally, instructions relative to educa- 
tion that approach perfection. The Conversations originated 
in the consultations that Madame de Maintenon had during 
the recreations or the recitations, either with the ladies ot 
  
1 Two volumes, 2d edition, 1861.
-P-A-G-E-255
EDUCATION OF WOMEN, 223 
with the young women, who themselves collected and edited 
the words of. their governess.” 
After the Letters and Conversations comes the Counsels to 
Young Women who enter Society, which contain general 
advice, conversations or dialogues, and, finally, proverbs, 
that is, short dramatic compositions, designed at once to 
instract and amuse the young ladies of Saint Cyr. These 
essays are not admirable in all respects ; most often they are 
lacking in imagination ; and Madame de Maintenon, though 
an imitation of Fénelon, makes a misuse of indirect instruc- 
tion, of artifice, and of amusement, in order to teach some 
moral commonplaces by insinuation. Here are the titles of 
some of these proverbs: The occasion makes the rogue; 
Women make and unmake the home; There is no situation 
more embarrassing than that of holding the handle of the fry- 
ing-pan. 
Finally, let.us note the third collection, the Historical and 
Instructive Letters addressed to the Lasdlies.of Saint Cyr? 
It is to be regretted that, out of these numerous volumes, 
where repetitions abound, there have not been extracted, in 
a methodical manner, a few hundred pages which should 
contain the subatance of Madame de Maintenon’s thinking 
on educational questions. 
287. Inver1or Organization. —The purpose of the found- 
ing of Saint Cyr was to assure to the two hundred and fifty . 
daughters of the poor nobility, and to the children of officers 
dead or disabled, an educational retreat where they would be 
suitably educated so as to be prepared for becoming either 
nuns, if this was their vocation, or, the more often, good 
mothers. As M. Gréard has justly observed, “‘the very 
conception of an establishment of this kind, the idea of

224 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
making France pay the debt of France, educating the chil- 
dren of those who had given her their blood, proceeds from 
a feeling up to that time unknown.” ! 
Consequently, children of the tenderest years, from six or 
seven, were received at Saint Cyr, there to be cared for till 
the age of marriage, till eighteen and twenty. 
The young girls were divided into four classes, — the reds, 
the greens, the yellows, and the blues. The blues were the 
largest, and they wore the royal colors. Each class was 
divided ‘into five or six bands or Families, of eight or ten 
pupils each. 
The ladies of Saint Cyr were ordinarily taken from the 
pupils of the school. They were forty in number, —the supe- 
rior, the assistant who supplied the place of the superior, 
the mistress of the novices, the general mistress of the 
classes, the mistresses of the classes, etc. 
The capital defect of Saint Cyr is, that, as in the colloges 
of the Jesuits, the residence is absolute and the sequestra- 
‘tion complete. From her fifth to her twentieth year the 
‘young girl belongs entirely to Saint Cyr. She scarcely 
knows her parents. It will be said, perhaps, that in many 
cases she has lost them, and that in some cases she could 
expect only bad examples from them. But no matter; the 
general rule, which interrupted family intercourse to the 
extent of almost abolishing it, cannot obtain our approbation. 
The girl was permitted to see her parents only three or four 
times a year, and even then these interviews would last. only 
for a half an hour each time, and in the presence of a mis- 
tress. There was permission to write family letters from 
time to time; but as though she mistrusted the natural im- 
pulses of the heart, and the free outpouring of filial affection, 
Madame de Maintenon had taken care to compose some models   
aM. Gréard, Mémoire sur U'enseignement secondaire des filles, 1882, p. 5%
-P-A-G-E-257
EDUCATION OF WOMEN. 225 
of these lefters. With more of reason than of feeling; Madame 
de Maintenon is not exempt from a certain coldness of heart. 
It seems that she would impose on her pupils the extraordi- 
nary habits of her own family. She recollected having been 
kiseed only twice by her mother, on her forehead, and then 
only after a long separation. 
238. Disrrusr or Rrapine. — After the reforms of 1692, 
the instruction at Saint Cyr became a matter of secondary 
importance. Reading, writing, and counting were taught, 
but scarcely anything besides. Reading, in. general, was 
viewed with distrust: ‘‘ Teach girls to be very sparing as to 
reading, and always to prefer manual labor instead.” Books 
of a secular nature were interdicted ; only works of piety 
were put in the hands of pupils, such as the Introduction to a 
Devout Life, by Saint Frangois de Salles, and the Confessions 
of Saint Augustine. ‘* Renounce intellectual culture ” is the 
perpetual ‘injunction of Madame de Maintetion. 
‘We must educate citizens for citizenship. It is not the 
question of giving them intellectual culture. We must 
preach family duties to them, obedience to husband, and care 
for children... Reading does more harm than good to 
young girls.... Books make witlings and excite an in- 
satiable curiosity.” 
239. Tux Sropy or History Necrecrep.—To judge of 
the spirit of Saint Cyr, from the point of view of intellectual 
education, it suffices to note the little importance that was 
there givén to history. This went so far as to raise the 
Guestion whether it were not best to prohibit the study of 
French history entirely. Madame de Maintenon consents to 
have it taught, but only just enough so that ‘‘ pupils may 
not confuse the succession of our kings with the .princes of 
other countries, and. not take # Roman emperor for en

226 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
emperor of China or Japan, a king of Spain or of England 
for a king of Persia or of Siam.” As to the history of anti- 
quity, it must be held in mistrust for the very reason— who 
would believe it? of the beautiful examples of virtue that 
it contains. ‘‘I should fear that those grand examples of 
generosity and heroism would give our young girls too much 
elevation of spirit, and make them vain and pretentious.” 
Tlave we not some right to feel surprised that Madame de 
Maintenon is alarmed at the thought of raising the intelligence 
of woman? It is true that she doubtless thought of the 
romantic exaggerations produced by the reading of the Cyrus 
the Great and other writings of Mlle. de Scudéry. Let us 
add, besides, to excuse the shortcomings of the programme 
of Saint Cyr in the matter of history, that even for boys ‘in 
the colleges of the University, the order that introduced the 
teaching of history into the classes dates only from 1695. 
240. Insurricienr Instrucrion. —‘‘ Our day,” says Laval- 
Iée, ‘would not accept that education in which instruction 
properly so-called was but a secondary matter, and entirely 
sacrificed to the manner of training the heart, the reason, and 
the character; and an education, too, that, as a whole and in 
its details, was wholly religious.” The error of Madame de 
Maintenon consists essentially in the wish to develop the 
moral virtues in souls scarcely instructed, scarcely enlightened. 
There was much moral discoursing at Saint Cyr. If it did 
not always bear fruit, it was because the seed fell into intel- 
ligences that were but little cultivated. . 
‘ Our young women are not to be made scholarly. 
never know except by halves, and the little that t 
usually makes them conceited, disdainful, chatty, wan wo 
gusted. with serious things.” 
241. Maxoat Lasor.—If intellectual education w: 
neglected at Saint Cyr, by way of compensation great atten:

tion was paid to manual education. The ‘girls were there 
taught to sew, to embroider, to knit, and to make tapestry; 
and there was also made there all the linen for the house, 
the infirmary, and the chapel, and the dresses and clothing 
of the ladies and the pupils : — . 
“But no exquisite productions,” says Madame de Mainte- 
non, ‘‘nor of very elaborate design; none of those flimsy 
edgings in embroidery or tapestry, which are of no use.” 
With what good grace Madame de Maintenon ever preaches 
the gospel of labor, of which she herself gave the example! 
In the coaches of the king, she always had some work in 
hand. At Saint Cyr, the young women swept the dormitories, 
put in order the refectory, and dusted the class-rooms. ‘‘ They 
must be put at every kind of service, and made to work at 
what is burdensome, in order to make them robust, healthy, 
’ and intelligent.” 
‘¢Manual labor is a moral safeguard, a protection against 
sin.” 
‘¢ Work calms the passions, occupies the mind, and does 
not leave it time to think of evil.” 
242. Mora Epvoanos. — ‘The Institute,” said Ma- 
dame de Maintenon, ‘is intended, not. for prayer, but for 
action.” What she wished, above all else, was to prepare 
- young women for home and family life. She devoted her 
thought to the training of wives and mothers. ‘‘ What I lack 
most,’’ she said, ‘‘is sons-in-law!” Hence she was inces- 
santly preoccupied with moral qualities. One might make 
a fine and valuable book of selections out of all the practical 
maxims of Madame de Maintenon; as her reflections on 
talkativeness: ‘*There is always sin in a multitude of 
words ;” on indolence: ‘‘ What can be done in the family of 
an indolent and fastidious woman?” on politeness, ‘‘ which 
consists, above all else, in giving one’s thought to others ;” 
 
-P-A-G-E-260
228 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
on lack of energy, then too common among women of the 
world: ** The only concern is to eat and to take one’s ease. 
Women spend the day in morning-gowns, reclining in easy- 
thairs, without any occupation, and without conversation; 
all is well, provided one be in a state of repose.” 
243. Discreet Devotion. —We must not imagine that 
Saint Cyr was a house of prayer, a place of overdone devo- 
tion. Madame de Maintenon held to a reasonable Christianity. 
Piety, such as was recommended at Saint Cyr, is a piety that 
is steadfast, judicious, and simple; that is, conformed to the 
state in which one ought to live, and exempt from refine- 
ments. 
‘‘The young women are too much at church, considering 
their age,” she wrote to Madame de Brinon, the first director 
of the institution. ... ‘Consider, I pray you, that this is 
not to be a cloister.’”’! 
“And later, after the reform had begun, this is what she 
wrote :— 
“Let the piety with which our young girls shall be in- 
spired be cheerful, gentle, and free. Let it consist rather 
in the innocence of their lives, and in the simplicity of their 
occupations, than in the austerities, the retirements, and the 
refinements of devotion.... When a girl comes from a 
convent, saying that nothing ought to interfere with vespers, 
she is laughed at; but when an educated woman shall say 
that vespers may be omitted for the sake of attending her 
sick husband, everybody will commend her.... When a 
girl shall say that a woman does better to educate her children 
and instruct her servants than to spend the forenoon in 
church, that religion will be heartily accepted, and will make 
itself loved and respected.”* Excellent advice, perhaps to¢

little followed‘! Madame de Maintenon here speaks the lan- 
guage of good sense, and we are wholly ‘surprised to hear it. 
from the lips of a politic woman who, not without reason, and 
for her part in the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, has 
the reputation of being an intolerant fanatic. 
244. Suwericrry 1s ALL Turnes.— The simplicity whic 
she recommended in religion, Madame de Maintenon de 
manded in everything, — in dress and in language: ‘+ Youn 
girls,” she says, ‘‘ must wear as few ribbons as possible.” 
A class-teacher had given a fine lecture, in which she ex- 
horted her pupils to make an “ eternal divorce” with sin. 
“Very well said, doubtless,” remarked Madame de Mainte- 
non; “but, pray, who among our young ladies knows what 
divorce is?” 
245. FineLon anp Saint Cyr. — Michelet, speaking of 
Saint Cyr, which he does not love, said : ‘ Its cold governess 
was much more a man than Fénelon.” The fact is, that the’ 
author of the Education of Girls gives a larger place to sen- 
sibility and intelligence. It is not Madame de Maintenon 
who said: ** As much as possible, tenderness of heart must 
be excused in young girls.” It is not at Saint Cyr that these 
maxims were practised. ‘Pray Jet them have Greek and 
Roman histories. They will find in them prodigies of cour- 
age and disinterestedness. Let them not be ignorant of the 
history of France, which also has its beauty.... All this 
serves to give dignity to the mind, and to litt the soul to 
noble sentiments.” | Nevertheless, Fénelon’s work was 
highly esteemed at Saint Cyr. It appeared in 1687, and 
Saint Cyr was founded in 1686. A great number of its 
precepts were there observed, such as the following: ‘‘ Fre- 
quent leaves of absence should be avoided ;”” ‘‘ Young girls 
should not be accustomed to talk much.”

246. Genera. Jupement. —In a word, if the ideal. pro« 
posed to the young women of Saint Cyr by Madame de 
Maintenon cannot satisfy those who, in our day, conceive “‘an 
education broader in its scheme and more liberal in its spirit,” 
at least we must do justice to an institution which was, a3 
its foundress said, ‘a kind of college,” a first attempt at 
enfranchisement in the education of women. Without de- 
manding of Madame de Maintenon what was not in her age 
to give, let us be inspired by her in what concerns the 
changeless education in moral virtues, and in the qualities 
of discretion, reserve, goodness, and submission. ‘+ How- 
ever severe that education may appear,” says Lavallée, “I 
believe it will suggest better reflections to those who observe 
the way in which women are educated to-day, and the results 
of that education in luxury and pleasure, not only on the 
fireside, but still more on society and political life, and on 
the future of the men that it is preparing for France. I 
“believe they will prefer that manly education, so to speak, 
which purified private morals and begot public virtues ; and 
that they will esteem and regret that work of Madame de 
Maintenon, which for a century prevented the corruption of 
the Court from extending to the provinces, and maintained 
in the old country-seats, from which came the greater part of 
the nobility, the substantial virtues and the simple manners 
of the olden time.” 
(247. Ansiyrica, Summary.—-l. The education of women 
in the seventeenth century reflects the sentiment of the age 
as to their relative position in society, their rights, and 
their destiny. Woman was still regarded as the inferior of 
man,-in the lower classes as a drudge, in the higher as an 
ornament; in her case, intellectual culture was regarded as 
either useless or dangerous; and the education that was

given her was to fit her fora life of devotion or a life of 
seclusion from society. 
2. The rules of Jacqueline Pascal exhibit the effects of 
an ascetic belief on education, —human nature is corrupt; 
all its likes are to be thwarted, and all its dislikes fostered 
under compulsion. 
3. The education directed by Madame de Maintenon is 
the beginning of a rupture with tradition. It was a move- 
ment towards the secularization of woman’s education, and 
towards the recognition of her equality with man, with re- 
spect to her grade of intellectual endowments, her intellectual 
culture, and to her participation in the duties of: real life. 
4. The type of the higher education was still monastic, 
both for men and women. No one was able to conceive 
that both sexes might be educated together with mutual 
advantage.] -

248, Tue Untversity or Parts.—Since the thirteenth 
century, the University of Paris had been a centre of light 
and a resort for students. Ramus could say: ‘¢This Uni- 
versity is not the university of one city only, but of the 
entire world.” But even in the time of Ramus, in conse- 
quence of the civil discords, and by reason also of the prog- 
ress in the colleges organized by the Company of Jesus, the 
University of Paris declined; she saw the number of her 
pupils diminish. She persisted, however, in the full light of 
the Renaissance, in following the superannuated regulations 
which the Cardinal d’Estouteville had imposed on her in 1452 ; 
she fell behind in the routine of the scholastic methods. A 
reform was necessary, and in 1600 it was accomplished by 
Henry IV.

249. Srarures or 1600.—The statutes of the new uni- 
versity were promulgated ‘‘ by the order and the will of the 
most Christian and most invincible king of France and 
Navarre, Henry 1V.” ‘This was the first time that the 
State directly intervened in the control of education, and 
that secular power was set up in opposition to the absolute 
authority of the Church. 
In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries a reform had 
been made in the University, by the Popes Innocent III. and 
Urban V. The reformer of 1452, the Cardinal a’Estouteville, 
acted as the legate of the pontifical power. On the contrary, . 
the statutes of 1600 were the work of a commission named 
by the king, and there sat at its deliberations, by the side of 
a few ecclesiastics, magistrates, and even professors. 
250. Oreanization or THE Dirrerenr Facutties. — The 
University of Paris comprised four Faculties: the Faculties 
of Theology, of Law, and of Medicine, which corresponded 
to what we to-day call superior instruction, and the Faculty 
of Arts, which was almost the equivalent of our secondary 
instruction.’ 
It: would take too long to enumerate ‘in this place the 
different innovations introduced by the statutes of +1600. 
Let us merely say a word of the Faculty of Arts. 
In the Faculty of Arts the door was finally opened to the 
classical authors. In a certain degree the tendencies of the

advanced instruction then in the primary schools;.and they were distin-

tion includes the colleges and lyeées in which are taught the ancient lan- 
guages, modern languages, history, mathematics, physics, chemistry, and 
philosophy... Public instruction is divided into primary, secondary, and 
superior instruction.’ ” — Litter &,

Renaissance were obeyed. Nevertheless, the methods and 
the general spirit were scarcely changed. Catholicism was 
obligatory, and the French language remained under ban. 
Frequent exercises in repetition and declamation were main- 
tained. The liberal arts were always considered ‘‘ the 
foundation of all the sciences.” Instruction in philosophy 
was always reduced to the interpretation of the texts of Aris- 
totle. As to history, and the sciences in general, no account 
whatever was taken of them. 
251. DECADENCE OF THE UNIVERSITY IN THE SEVENTEENTH 
Century. — The reform, then, was insufficient, and the 
results were bad. While the colleges of the Jesuits 
attracted pupils in crowds, and while the Oratorians and 
the Jansenists reformed secondary instruction, the colleges 
of the University’! remained mediocre and obscure. Save 
in rare. exceptions, there were no professors of distinc- 
tion ; the education was formal, in humble imitation of that 
of the Company of Jesus; there was an abuse of abstract 
rules, of grammatical exercises, of written tasks, and of 
Latin composition ; there was no disposition to take an ad- 
vance step; but an obstinate resistance to the new spirit, 
which was indicated either by the interdiction of the philoso- 
phy of Descartes, or by the refusal to teach in the French 
language; in a word, there was complete isolation in im-

from the Napoleonic University. ‘‘The latter was founded by a decree oi 
Napoleon L, March 17, 1808. It was first called the Imperial University, 
and then the University of France. It comprises: 1. The faculties;* 2. the

schools. All these are under the direction of a central administration.” —

movable routine, and in consequence, decadence, — such is a 
summary history of the University of Paris up to the last 
quarter of the seventeenth century. 
252. Tux Restoration oF Stupres anp Rorzin (1661- 
1741). — We must go forward to the time when Rollin 
taught, to observe a revival in the studies of the University. 
Several distinguished professors, as his master Hersan, Pour- 
chot, and still others, had prepared the way for him. There 
was then, from 1680 to 1700, a real rejuvenescence of 
studies, which was initiated in part by Rollin. _ 
‘Latin lost a little ground in consequence of a growing 
recognition of the rights of the French language and the 
national literature, which had just been made illustrious by so 
many masterpieces. The spirit of the Jansenist methods 
penetrated the colleges of the University. The Cartesian 
philosophy was taught in them, and a little more attention 
was given to the explication of authors, and a little less to 
the verbal repetition of lessons. New ideas began to infil- 
trate into the old citadel of scholasticism. The question 
came to be asked if celibacy was indeed an indispensable 
condition of the teaching office. Men began to comprehend 
that at least marriage was not a reason for exclusion. 
Finally, real progress was made in discipline as well as in 
methods, and the indubitable proof of this is the Treatise on 
Studies, by Rollin. 
253. Tux Treatise on Srupies. — Rollin has summed up 
his educational experience, an experience of fifty years, in a 
book which has become celebrated under the title of Treatise 
on Studies. The full title of this work was: De la maniére 
Penseigner et d’étudier les belles-lettres par rapport a Vesprit 
et au ceur. The first two volumes appeared in 1726, and 
the other two in 1728.

236 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. . 
The Treatise on Studies is not like the mile, which war 
published twenty years later, a work of venturesome inquiry 
and original novelties; but is a faithful exposition of the 
methods in use, and a discreet commentary on them. While 
this treatise belongs by its date to the eighteenth century, it 
is the pedagogy of the seventeenth century, and the tradi- 
tions of the University under the reign of Louis XIV. that 
Rollin has collected, and of which he has simply wished to 
be the reporter. In the Latin dedication, which he addresses 
to the Rector of the University of Paris, he clearly defines 
his intentions and his purpose :— 
‘*My first design was to put in writing and define the 
method of teaching which has long been in use among you, 
‘and which, up to this time, has been transmitted only by 
word of mouth, and through a sort of tradition ; and to erect, 
‘so far as I am able to do it, a durable monument of the 
rules and practice which you have followed in the instruction 
‘of youth, for the purpose of preserving, in all its integrity, 
the taste for belles-lettres, and to preserve it, if possible, 
from the injuries and the alterations of time.” 
254. Dirrerenr Opinions. — Rollin has always bad warm 
admirers. Voltaire called the Treatise a book “ forever 
useful,” and whatever may be our reservations on the defi- 
‘ciences, and on the short and narrow views of certain parts 
of the pedagogy of Rollin, we must subscribe to this judg- 
ment. But we shall not go so far as to accept the enthusi- 
astic declarations of Villemain, who complains that the study 
of the Treatise is neglected in our time, ‘‘as if new methods 
. had. been discovered for training the intelligence and the 
heart”; and he adds, ‘‘ Since the Treatise on Studies, not a 
forward step has been taken.” This is to undervalue all the 
earnest efforts that have been made for two centuries by
-P-A-G-E-269
ROLLIN. 237 
educators just as profound as was the ever timid and cautious 
Rollin. When we compare the precepts of the Treatise with 
the reforms which the spirit of progress has already effected, 
and particularly with those which it will effect, we are 
astonished to hear Nisard say: ‘*In educational matters, 
the Treatise. on Studies is the unique book, or better still, 
the book.” 
To put such a burden of pompous praise on Rollin is to 
compromise his real worth; and without ceasing to do 
justice to his wise and judicious spirit, we wish to employ 
more discretion in our admiration. 
255. Drvisron oF THE TREATISE on SruprEs. — Before 
calling attention te the most interesting parts of the Treatise 
on Studies, let us briefly state the object of the eight books 
of which it is composed. 
The Treatise opens with a Preliminary Discourse which 
‘recites the advantages of instruction. o 
The title of the first book is: Hwercises which are proper 
for very young children; of the education of girls. Rollin 
acknowledges that he treats only very superficially “this 
double subject;” which is foreign to his original plan. In 
fact, the first edition of his Treatise on Studies contained but 
séven books, and it is only in 1734 that he wrote, ‘‘at the 
urgent requests.and prayers of several persons,” that short 
essay on the education of boys and girls which first appeared 
under the form of a supplement, and which became the first 
book of the work only in the subsequent editions. 
The different subjects proper for training the youth in 
the public schools, that is, in the colleges,——such is the 
object of the six books which follow: Book II. Of the learn- 
ing of the languages ; that is, the study of Greek and Latin; 
Book III. Of poetry; Book IV. Of rhetoric; Book V. Qf
-P-A-G-E-270
238 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
the three kinds of eloquence; Book VI..Of history; Book 
VII. Of philosophy. 
Book VIII., the last, entitled Of the interior government 
of schools and colleges, has a particular character. It does 
not treat of studies and intellectual exercises, but of disci- 
pline and moral education. It is, on all accounts, the most 
original and interesting part of Rollin’s work, and it opens 
to us the treasures of his experience. This eighth book has 
been justly called the ‘‘ Memoirs of Rollin.”” That which 
constitutes its merit and its charm is that the author here at 
last decides to be himself. He does not quote the ancients 
so much; but he speaks in his own name, and relates what 
he has done, or what he has seen done. 
256. General Reriections on Epucatron. — There is 
little to be gathered out of the Preliminary Discourse of 
Rollin. He is. but slightly successful in general reflections. 
When he ventures to philosophize, Rollin easily falls into 
platitudes. He has a dissertation to prove that ‘‘ study 
gives the mind more breadth and elevation; and that study 
gives capacity for business.” 
On the purpose of education, Rollin, who copies the 
moderns when he does not translate from the ancients, is 
content with reproducing the preamble of the regulations’ of 
Henry IV., which assigned to studies three purposes: learn- 
jng, morals and manners, and religion. 
‘The happiness of kingdoms and peoples, and particularly 
of a Christian State, depends on the good education of the 
youth, where the purpose is to cultivate and to polish, by the 
study of the sciences, the intelligence, still rude, of the young, 
and thus to fit them for filling worthily the different vocations 
to which they are destined, without which they will be useless 
to the State ; and finally, to teach them the sincere religious
-P-A-G-E-271
ROLLIN. 239 
practices which God requires of them, the inviolable attach- 
ment they owe to their fathers and mothers and to their 
country, and the respect and obedience which they are bound 
to render princes and magistrates.” 
257. Primary Sroupres. — Rollin is original when he in- 
troduces us to the classes of the great colleges where he has 
lived; but is much less so when he speaks to us of little 
children, whom he has never seen near at hand. He has 
never known family life, and scarcely ever visited public 
schools ; and it is through his recollections of Quintilian that 
he speaks to us of children. 
There is, then, but little to note in the few pages that he 
has devoted to the studies of the first years, from three to 
six or seven, 
One of the most interesting things we find here, perhaps, 
is the method which he recommends for learning to read, — 
‘“ the typographic cabinet of du Mas.” “It is a novelty,” 
says the wise Rollin, “‘ and it is quite common and natural 
that we should be suspicious of this word novelty.” But 
after the examination, he decides in favor of the system in 
question, which consists in making of instruction in reading, 
something analogous to the work of an apprentice who is 
learning to print. The pupil has before him a table, and on 
this table is placed a set of pigeon-holes, ‘“ logettes,” which 
contain the letters of the alphabet, printed on cards. The 
pupil is to arrange on the table the different letters needed to 
construct the words required of him. The reasons that 
Rollin gives for recommending this method, successful tests 
of which he had seen made, prove that he had taken into 
account the nature of the child and his need of activity : — 
“This method of learning to read, besides several other 
sdvantages, has one which seems to'me very considerable, —
-P-A-G-E-272
240 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
it is that of being amusing and agreeable, and of not having 
the appearance of study. Nothing is more wearisome or 
tedious in infancy than severe mental effort while the body 
isin a state of repose. With this device, the mind of the 
child is not wearied. He need not make a painful effort at 
recollection, because the distinction and the name of the 
boxes strike his senses. He is not constrained to a posture 
that is oppressive by being always tied to the place where he 
is made to read. There is free activity for eyes, hands, and 
feet.. The child looks for his letters, takes them out, 
arranges them, overturns them, separates them, and finally 
replaces them in their boxes. This movement is very much 
to his taste, and is exactly adapted to the active and restless 
disposition of that age.” : 
Rollin seems really to believe that there ‘‘is no danger in 
beginning with the reading of Latin.” However, ‘‘for the 
schools of the poor, and for those in the country, it is 
better,” he says, ‘to fall in with the opinion of those who 
believe that it is necessary to begin with the reading of 
French.” 
It may be thought that Rollin puts a little too much into 
the first years of the child's course of study. Before the 
age of six or seven he ought to have learned to read, to 
write, to be nourished on the Historical Catechism of Fleury, 
to know some of the fables of La Fontaine by heart, and to 
have studied French grammar, and geography. At least, 
Rollin requires that ‘no thought, no expression, which is 
within the child’s range,” shall be allowed to be passed by. 
He requires that the teacher speak little, and that he make 
the child speak much, ‘‘ which is one of the most essential 
duties and one of those that are the least practised.” He 
demands, above all else, clearness of statement, and com- 
mends the use of illustrations and pictures in reading books. 
 
-P-A-G-E-273

“They are very suitable,” he says, ‘for striking the atten- 
tion of children, and for fixing their memory; this is prop- 
erly the writing of the ignorant.’’* 
258. Tue Enucation or Grrts. ~ The same reasons ex- 
plain the shortcomings of Rollin’s views on the education of 
women, and the relative mediocrity of his ideas on the edu- 
cation of children, Living in solitude and in the celibate 
state, he had no personal information on these subjects, and 
so he goes back to Fénelon for his ideas on the education of 
women, and to Quintilian in the case of children. 
Is the study of Latin fit for girls? Such is the first ques- 
tion which he raises ; but he has the wisdom to answer it in 
the negative, save for ‘‘ nuns, and also for Christian virgins 
and widows.” ‘There is no difference in minds,” Rollin 
emphatically says, ‘‘that is due to sex.” But he does not 
extend the consequences of this excellent principle very far. 
  
1 Save once, Rollin has scarcely made an allusion to primary instruc- 
tion proper. We quote this passage on account of its singularity: “ Several 
years ago there was introduced into most of the schools for the poor in 
Paris a metwu which is very useful to scholars, and which spares much 
trouble to the teachers. The school is divided into several classes. I 
select only one of them, that composed of children who already know how 
to write syllables ; the others must be judged by this one. I suppose that 
the subject of the reading lesson is Dixit Dominus Domino meo - Sede a 
dextris meis. Each child pronounces one syllable, as Di. His competitor, 
who stands opposite, takes up the next, «iz, and soon. The whole class is 
attentive ; for the teacher, without warning, passes at once from the head 
of the line to the middle, or to the foot, and the recitation must continue 
without interruption. If a pupil makes a mistake in some syllable, the 
teacher, without speaking, raps upon the table with his stick, and the com- 
Petitor is obliged to repeat as it should be the syllable that has been 
wrongly pronounced. If he fail also, the next, upon a second rap of the 
stick, goes back to the same syllable, and go on till it has been pronounced 
correctly, More than thirty years ago, I saw with unusual pleasure this 
method in successful operation at Orleans, where it originated through the 
care and industry of M. Garot, who presided over the schools of that 
city.”
-P-A-G-E-274
242 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
He is content to require of women the four rules of arith- 
metic; orthography, in which he is not over exacting, for 
“¢ their ignorance of orthography should not be imputed to 
them as a crime, since it is almost universal in their sex ;” 
ancient history and the history of France, ‘‘ which it is dis- 
graceful to every good Frenchman not to know.”? As to 
reading, Rollin is quite as severe as Madame de Maintenon : 
‘* The reading of comedies and tragedies may be very dan- 
gerous for young ladies.” He sanctions only Esther and 
Athalie. Music and dancing are allowed, but without enthu- 
siasm and with endless precautions : — 
‘* An almost universal experience shows that the study of 
music is an extraordinary dissipation.” 
**T do not know how the custom of having girls learn to 
sing and play on instruments at such great expense has 
become so common.... I hear it said that as soon as they 
enter on life’s duties, they make no farther use of it.” 
259. Tae Srupy or Frencu. — Rollin is chiefly preoccu- 
pied with the study of the ancient languages ; but he has the 
merit, notwithstanding his predilection for exercises in Latin, 
of having followed the example of the Jansenists so far as 
the importance accorded to the French language is con- 
cerned. 
“Tt is a disgrace,” he says, ‘‘ that we are ignorant of our 
own language ; and if we are willing to confess the truth, we 
will almost all acknowledge that we have never studied it.” 
Rollin admitted that he was “‘ much more proficient in the 
study of Latin than in that of French.” In the opening of 
his: Treatise, which he wrote in’ French only that he might 
place hiniself within the reach of his young readers and their 
parents, he excuses himself for making a trial in a kind of 
  1 Rollin does not require it, however, of young men.
-P-A-G-E-275
‘ROLLIN. 248 
writing which is almost new to him. And in congratulating 
him on his work, d’Aguesseau wrote, ‘‘ You speak French 
as if it were your native tongue.” Such was the Rector of 
the University in France at the commencement of the 
eighteenth century. 
Let us think well of him, therefore, for having so over- 
come his own habits of mind as to recommend the study of 
French. He would have it learned, not only through use, 
but also ‘‘ through principles,” and would have ‘‘ the genius 
of the language understood, and all its beauties studied.” 
Rollin has a high opinion of grammar, but would not 
encourage a misuse of it:— 
‘¢Long-continued lessons on such dry matter might be- 
come very tedious to pupils. Short questions, regularly 
proposed each day after the manner of an ordinary conversa- 
tion, in which they themselves would be consulted, and in 
which the teacher would employ the art of having them tell 
what he wished to make them learn, would teach them in the 
way of amusement, and, by an insensible progress,. con- 
tinued for several years, they would acquire a profound 
knowledge of the language.” 
It is in the Treatise on Studies that we find for the first 
time a formal list of classical French authors. Some of 
these are now obscure and forgotten, as the Remarkable 
Lives written by Marsolier, and the History of the Academy 
of Inscriptions and Belles-Lettres, by de Boze; but the most 
of them have held their place in our programmes, and the 
judgments of Rollin have been followed for two centuries, on 
the Discourse on Universal History, by Bossuet, on the works 
of Boileau and Racine, and on the Logic of Port Royal. 
Like all his contemporaries, Rollin particularly recom- 
mends Latin composition to his pupils. However, he has 
spoken a word for French composition, which should bear,
-P-A-G-E-276
244 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY 
first, on fables and historical narratives, then on exercises i 
epistolary style, and finally, on common things, descriptions, 
and short speeches. . 
260. Greek anp Larm.— But it is in the teaching of 
the ancient languages that Rollin has especially tried the 
resources of his pedagogic art. or two centuries, in the 
colleges of the University, his recommendations have been 
followed. In Greek, he censures the study of themes, and 
reduces the study of this language to the understanding of 
authors. More of a Latinist than of a Hellenist, of all the 
arguments he offers to justify the study of Greek, the best 
is, that, since the Renaissance, Greek has always been 
taught; but, without great success, he admits : — 
“Parents,” he says, ‘‘are but little inclined in favor of 
Greek. They also learned Greek, they claim, in their youth, 
and they have retained nothing of it; this is the ordinary 
language which indicates that one has not forgotten much of 
it.” , 4 
But Latin, which it does not suffice to learn to read, but 
which must be written and spoken, is the object of all 
Rollin’s care, who, on this point, gives proof of consummate 
experience. Like the teachers of Port Royal, he demands 
that there shall be no abuse of themes in the lower classes, 
and recommends the use of oral themes, but he holds firmly 
to version, and to the explication of authors : — 
‘s Authors are like a living dictionary, and a speaking 
grammar, whereby we learn, through experience, the very 
force and the true use of words, of phrases, and of the rules 
of syntax.” 
This is not the place to analyze the parts of the Treatise 
on Studies which relate to poetics and rhetoric, and which 
are the code, now somewhat antiquated, of Latin verse and 
prose. Rollin brings to bear on this theme great professional
-P-A-G-E-277
ROLLIN. 245 
sagacity, but also a spirit of narrowness. He condemns 
ancient mythology, and excludes, as dangerous, the French 
poets, save some rare exceptions. He claims that the true 
use of poetry belongs to religion. He has no conception of 
the salutary and wholesome influence which the beauties of 
poetry and eloquence can exercise over the spirit. 
261. Rotxiw Tue Hisrortan. — Rollin hag made a reputa- 
tion as an historian. Frederick II. compares him to Thucy- 
dides, and Chateaubriand has emphatically called him the 
‘“Fénelon of History.” Montesquieu himself has pleasantly 
said: ‘¢.A noble man has enchanted the public through his 
works on history ; it is heart which speaks to heart; we feel - 
a secret satisfaction in hearing virtue speak; he is the bee of 
France.” 
Modern criticism has dealt justly with these exaggerations. 
The thirteen volumes of his Ancient History, which Rollin 
published, from 1730 to 1738, are scarcely read to-day. Tis 
great defect as an historian is his lack of erudition and of 
the critical spirit; he accepts with credulity every fable and 
every legend. 
We are to recollect, however, that as professor of history 
—and in truth he pretended to be only this— Rollin has 
greater worth than as an historian. He knew how to intro- 
duce into the exposition of facts great simplicity and great 
facility. And especially he attempted to draw from events 
their moral lesson. ‘‘ We ought not to forget,” says a 
German of our time, “that Rollin has never made any 
personal claim to be considered an investigator in historical 
study, but that the purpose he had chiefly in view was educa- 
tional. As he was the first to introduce the study of history 
into French colleges (this is true only of the colleges of 
the University), he sought to remedy the complete absence 
of historical reading adapted to the needs of the young
-P-A-G-E-278
246 / THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
‘This is a great educational feat; for it is undeniable that his 
works are of a nature to give to the young of all nations a 
real taste for the study of history, and at the same time 
a vivid conception of the different epochs, and of the life of 
nations.” ! 
°262. Tue Teacuine or History. — However, considered 
simply asa professor of history, Rollin is far from being 
irreproachable. Doubtless it is good to moralize on history, 
and to make of it, as he says, ‘‘a school of enduring glory 
and real grandeur.” But is not historical accuracy neces- 
sarily compromised, and is there not danger of making the 
subject puerile, when the teacher is guided exclusively by 
the idea of moral edification ? 
Another graver fault in Rollin is that he systematically 
omits the history of France, and with it, all modern history. 
In this respect, he ‘falls below the Oratory, Port Royal, 
Bossuet, Fénelon, and Madame de Maintenon. It is inter- 
esting to observe, moreover, that Rollin recognizes the utility 
of the study of national history, but his excuse for omitting 
it is the lack of time : —. 
“T'do not speak of the history of France.... Ido not 
‘think it possible to find time, during the regular course of 
instruction, to make'a place for this study; but I am far 
from ‘considering it as of no importance, and I observe with 
regret that it is neglected by many persons to whom, never- 
theless, it would be very useful, not to say necessary. 
When I say this, it is myself that I criticise first, for I 
“acknowledge that I have not given sufficient attention to it, 
and I am ashamed of being in some sort a stranger in my 
own country after having traversed so many others.” 
  “1 Doctor Wolker, quoted by Cadet, in his edition of Rollin, Paris, 1882
-P-A-G-E-279
~ ROLLIN. "BAT 
963. PuiosoPay. — It ‘is moral edification that Rollin 
seeks in philosophical studies, as in historical studies. With 
but little competence in these matters, he admits that he has 
applied himself only very superficially to the study of 
philosophy. He knows, however, the value of ethics and 
logic, which govern the morals and perfect the mind; of 
physics, which furnishes us a mass of interesting know]- 
edge; and finally, of metaphysics, which fortifies the religious 
sentiment. The ethics of antiquity seems to him worthy of 
attention; it is, in his view, the introduction to Christian 
ethics. 
264. Screnriric Instruction. —Rollin has given us a com- 
pendium of astronomy, of physics, and of natural history. 
Without doubt his essays have but a moderate value. 
Rollin’s knowledge is often inexact, and his general ideas 
are narrow. He is capable of believing that ‘nature entire 
is made for man.” But yet he deserves some credit for hav~ 
ing comprehended the part that the observation of the sensi- 
ble world ought to play in education : — 
‘*T call children’s physics a study of nature which requires 
scarcely anything but eyes, and which, for this reason, is 
within the reach of all sorts of persons, and even of children. 
It consists in making ourselves attentive to the objects which 
nature presents to us, to consider them with care, and to. 
admire their different beauties; but without searching into 
their secret causes, which comes within the province of the 
physics of the scientist. 
“T say that even children are capable of this, for they have 
eyes, and are not wanting in curiosity. They wish to know; 
they are inquisitive. It is only necessary to awaken and 
nourish in them the desire to learn and to know, which is 
satural to all men. This study, moreover, if it may be so

called, far from “being painful and tedious, affords only 
pleasure and amusement; it may take the place of recrea- 
tion, and ordinarily ought not to take place save in playing. 
It is inconceivable how much knowledge of things children 
might gain, if we knew how to take advantage of all the 
occasions which they furnish for the purpose.” 
265. Toe Epucative Cnaracter or Roiiry’s Pepacoer. 
—JIt should not be supposed that Rollin’s exclusive purpose 
was to make Latinists: and literary men. I know very well 
that he himself has said that ‘‘to form the taste was his 
principal aim.” ‘Nevertheless, he has thought of other 
things, — moral qualities not less than intellectual endow- 
ments. He wished to train at once ‘‘the heart and the 
intellect.” With him, instruction in all its phases takes an 
educative turn. He esteems knowledge only because it leads 
to virtue. In the explication of authors, attention should be 
directed to the morality of their thoughts, at least as much 
as to their literary beauty. The maxims and examples which 
their writings contain should be skillfully put in relief, so 
that these readings may become moral lessons not less than 
studies in rhetoric. To sum up in a word, Rollin follows the 
tradition of the Jansenists, and not that of the Company of 
Jesus. 
266. CurisTianmyY or Rowiin. — Rollin, though perse- 
cuted for his Jansenist tendencies, was a fervent Christian. 
‘* A Roman probity” did not suffice for him; he desired a 
Christian virtue. Consequently, he requires that religious 
instruction should form a part of every lesson. A regulation 
which dates from his rectorship required that the scholar in 
each class should learn and recite each day one or mora 
maxims drawn from the Holy Scriptures. This custom has 
deen maintained to this day. Rollin knew, moreover, tha!

the best means of inspiring piety is to preach by example, 
and to be pious one’s self : — 
*¢ To make true Christians, — this is the end and purpose of 
the education of children; all the rest but fulfills the pur- 
pose of means.... When a teacher has received this spirit, 
there is nothing more to say to him... .” 
The religious spirit of Rollin comes to view on each page 
of his book: — 
‘Tt remains for me,” he says, in concluding his preface, 
“to pray God, in whose hands we all are, we and our dis- . 
courses, fo deign to bless my good intentions.” 
267. Invention Discteuine or THE Cortzcus.—The part 
of the Treatise on Studies which has preserved the most 
interest, and which will be studied with the most. profit, is 
certainly that which treats of the interior government of 
schools and colleges. Here, though he, does not completely 
divest himself of his method of borrowings, and references 
to the authority of others, and though he is especially under 
the influence of Locke, whose wise advice on rewards and 
punishments he reproduces almost verbatim, Rollin makes 
use of a long personal experience. We have charged him 
with not knowing the little child. On the other hand, he 
knows exactly what scholars a little older are, — children 
from ten to sixteen years old. And he not only knows 
them, but he loves them tenderly. He gives them this testi- 
mony, which affection alone can explain, that he has always 
found them reasonable. 
268. ENUMERATION OF THE QUESTIONS TREATED BY Roz- 
rin. + To give an idea of this part of the Treatise, the best 
way is to reproduce the titles of the thirteen articles com- 
posing the chapter entitled General Counsels on the Hduce 
tion of the Young:—
-P-A-G-E-282
"250 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
I. What end should be proposed in education? II.- How 
to study the character of children in order to become able to 
instruct them properly. III. How at once to gain authority 
over children. IV. How to become loved and feared. 
V. Punishments: 1. Difficulties and dangers in punish- 
~ ments; 2. Rules to be observed in punishments. VI. Rep- 
rimands: 1. Occasion for reprimanding; 2. Time for 
making the reprimand; 3. Manner of reprimanding. VII.

Piety, religion, zeal for ‘the salvation of children. 
269. Ptsric Epucation. — Rollin does not definitely ex- 
‘press himself on the. superiority of public education. He 
does not dare give formal advice to parents; but he brings 
forward the advantages of the common life of colleges with 
so much force, that it is very evident that he prefers it to 
a private education. Let it be noted, besides, that he 
accepts on his own. account ‘‘ the capital maxim of the 
ancients, that children belong more to the State than to 
their parents.” 
270. Tue Rop.—In the matter of discipline, Rollin 
leans rather to the side of mildness. However, he does not 
dare pronounce himself absolutely against the use of the rod. 
That which in particular causes him to hesitate, which gives 
him scruples, which prevents him from expressing a censure 
which is at the bottom of his heart, but which never rises to 
his lips, is that there are certain texts of the Bible whose
-P-A-G-E-283
th ROLLIN. : 251. 
interpretation is favorable to the use of the rod. It is inter- 
esting to notice how, in a strait between his sentiments as a 
docile Christian and his instincts towards mildness, the good 
and timid Rollin tries to find a less rigorous meaning in the 
sacred text, and to convince himself that the Bible does not 
say what it seems to say. After many hesitations, he finally 
comes to the conclusion that corporal chastisements are per- 
mitted, but that they are not to be employed save in ex- 
treme and desperate cases; and this is also the conclusion 
of Locke. 
271. PoNIsHMENTS IN GENERAL.— But how many wise 
counsels on punishments, and on the precautions that must 
be taken when we punish or reprimand! One should refrain 
from punishing a child at the moment he commits his fault, 
because this might then exasperate him and provoke him to 
new breaches of duty. Let the master be cool when he 
punishes, and avoid the anger which discredits his authority. 
The whole of this excellent code of scholastic discipline might 
be quoted with profit. Rollin is reason and good sense itself 
when he guides and instructs the teacher as to his relations 
with the pupil. Doubtless the most of these precepts are not 
new; but when they come from the mouth of Rollin, there 
is something added to them which I cannot describe, but 
which gives to the most threadbare advice the authority of 
personal experience. 
272. Concuusion. — We shall not dwell on the other 
precepts of Rollin. The text must be consulted for his 
reflections on plays, recreations, the means of making study 
attractive, and on the necessity of appealing to the child’s 
reason betimes, and of explaining to him why one does this 
or that. In this last part of the Z'reatise on Studies there is 
a complete infant psychology which is lacking neither in
-P-A-G-E-284
252 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
Keenness nor.in penetration. In particular, there is a code 
of moral discipline which cannot be too highly commended 
to educators, and to all those who desire, in the words of 
Rollin, ‘‘to train at once the heart and the mind” of the 
young. Rollin has worked for virtue even more than for 
science. His works are less literary productions than works 
on morals, and the author himself is the perfect expression 
of what can be done for the education of the young by the 
Christian spirit allied to the university spirit. 
(273. Anaryricat Summary. —1. The characteristic fact 
disclosed by this study is. the very slow rate at which prog- 
ress in education takes place. There is also an enforce- 
ment of the lesson which has reappeared from time to time, 
that education follows in the wake of new and general 
movements in human thought. 
2. A more specific fact is the extreme conservatism of 
universities, or the tenacity with which they hold to tradi- 
tions. The question is suggested whether, after all, the 
conservative habit of the university does not best befit its 
judicial fanctions. 
3. In the elbowing of the classics by history and French, 
we see the rise of innovations which have become embodied 
in the modern university. 
4. A new factor in the higher education is the interven- 
tion of the State, as opposed to the historical domination of 
the Church. In the reform of the University of Paris the 
State became an educator. 
5. There is evidence of some progress in the historical 
struggle towards the conception that woman has equal 
rights with man in the benefits of education.]

274. Tux State or Primary Instruction in THE SEVEN- 
veenta Century. —It does not form a part of our plan to 
follow from day to day the small increments of progress and 
the slow development of the primary schools of France; 
but we must confine ourselves to the essential facts and to 
the important dates. . 
The Catholic Church, in the sixteenth and seventeenth 
eenturies, did not altogether renounce her interest in popu- 
lar instruction. She took measures, without doubt, to evan- 
gelize the poor people, and sometimes ‘even to teach them

how to read and write.” Nevertheless, up to the organiza: 
tion of the Christian schools, by La Salle, no serious effort 
was made. Some religious foundations establish gratuitous 
schools in many places, — charity schools, -— but no compre- 
hensive purpose directs these establishments. Conflicts of 
prerogative among certain independent colleagues, as that 
between the writing-masters and the masters of the infant 
schools placed under the direct authority of the precentor, or 
among the rectors and the tutors (écoldtres), that is, the 
assistants of the bishops charged with the supervision of the 
schools, — such dissensions came still further to defeat the 
good intentions of individuals, and to.embarrass the feeble 
movement that was exerted in favor of popular instruction. 
For example, towards 1680, the writing-masters attempted 
to prevent the masters of the primary schools? from giving 
writing lessons, at least, from giving their pupils any copies 
except monosyllables; and a decree of Parliament is neces- 
sary to re-establish the liberty — and then under certain 
restrictions — of teaching to write. 
“Christian instruction was neglected, not to say dishon- 
ored,” is the statement of contemporaries. The children 
who attended the schools of the poor were subjected to pub- 
lic contempt. They were obliged to wear on their caps a 
distinctive badge. In brief, far from progressing, primary 
instruction was rather in a state of decadence. 
275. Diuia anp THE Primary Scuoors or Lyons. — 
Among the progressive men who struggled against this 
unhappy state of affairs, and who tried to develop the 
Catholic schools, we must mention, before La Salle, Démia,

at this period. By the Jansenists this term was used in a more distinctive 
sense, and for this reason I have translated it ‘Little’ Schools” im Chap

a priest of° ‘Lyons, who, in 1666, founded the Congregation 
of the Brethren,of ‘Saint Charles, for the instruction of poor 
children. The Institute of La Salle was not organized till 
eighteen years later, in 1684. In 1668, having addressed 
to the provosts of the merchants of the city of Lyons a 
warm appeal, his Proposals for the establishment of Christian 
schools for thé instruction of the poor, Démia obtained an 
annual grant of two hundred livres. In 1675 he was 
charged by “express command” of the archbishop of 
Lyons “ with the management and direction of the schools 
of that city and diocese,” amd drew up a body of school 
regulations which was quoted as a model.’ For the method 
of “« teaching to read, of learning the catechism, of cor- 
recting children, and’ similar things,” Démia conformed to 
the book known’ as the Parish School (Ecole paroissiale), of 
which we shall presently say a word. He took it upon him- 
self to prooded” ‘“to the examination of the religion, the 
ability, and the good morals, of the persons who proposed 
to teach school.” But, what was of greater moment, he 
established, for preparing and training them, a sort of semi- 
A few quofations will give an idea of Démia’s zeal in the 
establishment of Christian schools. 
“Phis establishment is of such importance and of so 
great utility, that there is nothing in our political organiza- 
tion which is tore ‘worthy of the care and the watchfulness 
of the magistrates, since on it depend our peace and public 
tranquillity. ‘The poor, not having the means of educating 
their children, idave them in ignorance of their obligations. 
.. » Thus we see, ‘with keen displeasure, that such an edu- 
cation of the children of the poor is totally neglected, 
although it most important interest of the State, of

which they comprise the largest part; and, although it is 
quite as necessary, and even more so, to maintain public 
schools for them, as to support colleges. for the children of 
families in good circumstances. . . .” 
276. CLaupe JoLy.—In 1676, Claude Joly, precentor of 
Notre Dame, “‘collator, director, and judge of the primary 
schools of the city, the suburbs, and the outskirts of Paris,” 
published his Christian and Moral Counsels for the Instruction 
of Children. There is but little to gather from this work, 
where the author is so forgetful of elementary instruction as 
to speak only of secondary instruction and of ‘the educa- 
tion of princes. What most concerns Claude Joly is to put 
in force the regulations which forbid the association of boys 
and girls in the schools. The separation of the sexes-was 
for a long time an absolute principle in France. _Démia, in 
article nine of his regulations, restores the ordinance of the 
archbishop of Lyons, ‘‘ which forbids school-masters to 
admit girls, and school-mistresses to admit boys.” Rollin 
was of the same opinion. Claude Joly, in the capacity of 
chief precentor, bluntly claimed his sovereign rights in the 
matter of primary instruction :— 
‘¢ We shall contest the power claimed by the rectors of 
Paris to control the schools, under the name and pretext of 
charity, without the permission of the chief precentor, to 
whom alone belongs this power. To him, also, belongs the 
right of nomination to the schools of the religious and secu- 
lar communities. We shall disclose, besides, the attempts 
of writers to interfere with the teaching of orthography, 
which belongs only to good grammarians, that is, to the 
_tmasters of the little schoo 
We see to what petty questions of prerogative was sacri- 
ficed, in the seventeenth century, the great cause of populat 
instruction.

CATHOLICISM AND PRIMARY INSTRUCTION. 257 
277. Tue Book or rae Parish Scnoor.— Under the 
title, The Parish School, or the Manner of Properly Instruct- 
ing the Children in the Little Schools, a priest of the diocese 
of Paris had written, in 1655, a school manual, often re- 
printed,! which became the general standard of the schools 
during the years that followed, and which gives an exact 
idea of what was narrow and poorly defined in the primary 
instruction of that period. 
The author of the Parish School does not have a high 
opinion of the office of the teacher, which he regards as an 
employment without lustre, without pleasure, and without 
interest. He does not expect great results from instruction, 
of which he is pleased to say, that ¢ is not completely useless. 
It is true that instruction is reduced to a very few things, — 
reading, writing, and counting. To this the author adds 
religion and politeness. 
Let us observe in particular, that the programme of. the 
parish school also comprises the principles of the Latin lan- 
guage. The primary school of that period was still con- 
founded with the college of secondary instruction; the 
ancient languages and rhetoric were taught in it. In the 
catalogue of the master’s books, drawn up by the author of 
the Parish School, we find a Greek grammar. In the classes, 
the reading of Latin precedes the reading of French. 
Some good advice in practical pedagogy might be extracted 
from the first part of the work, especially on the duties of a 
school-master,on the power of example, and on the necessity 
of knowing the disposition of pupils. But how many art- 
Jess assertions and mischievous precepts, in that school code 
of the city of Paris, in the near presence of the grand cen- 
tury! The-Parish School complains that. the scholars eat 
too much bread :~

258 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
“©The children of Paris, as a rule, eat'a great deal of 
bread. This food stupefies the mind, and very often makes 
them, at the age of nine or ten, incapable of learning. 
Omnis repletio mala, panis vero pessima.” A serious mat- 
ter is that espionage is not only authorized, but is encouraged 
and organized : — 
“«The master will select two of the most reliable and 
intelligent to be on the lookout for the disorders. and the 
improprieties of the school and the church. They shall 
write the names pf the offenders, and of those guilty of 
improprieties,-on pieces of paper or on tablets, to be given 
to the master. These officers shall be called observers.” 
278, La Saiz (1651-1719) anp THe Cristian ScHoors. 
— The reading of the Parish School prepares us the better 
to comprehend the work of La Salle. If one were in any 
degree tempted to depreciate the Institute of the Brethren 
’ of the Christian Schools, it would suffice, to counteract this 
disposition, to contrast the reforms of La Salle, however 
insufficient they may be, with the real state of the schools of 
that period. To be equitably judged, human institutions 
ought to ‘be replaced in their setting and in their environ- 
ment. It is-easy to-day to formulate charges against the 
pedagogy of the Brethren of the Christian Schools. But 
eonsidered in their time, and compared with what existed, 
or rather with what did not exist, the establishments of La 
Salle deserve the esteem and the gratitude of the friends of 
instruction. They represent the first systematic effort of the 
Catholic Church to organize popular instruction. What the 
Jesuits did in fhe matter of secondary instruction, with im- 
mense resources and for pupils who paid them for their 
efforts, La Salle attempted in primary instruction, through 
a thousand obstacles and for pupils who did not pay.
-P-A-G-E-291
CATHOLICISM AND PRIMARY INSTRUCTION. "259 
279. Lire anp Caaracter or La Satux.— We shall have 
to criticise in the most of its principles and in many details 
of its practice, the educational institute of La Salle. But 
that which merits an admiration without reserve is the 
professional zeal of the founder of the order, the daunt- 
less spirit of improvement which he displayed in the 
organization of his schools, and in the recruitment of 
his teachers; it is also his tenacious zeal which was dis- 
couraged neither by the jealous opposition of corporations, 
the writing-masters for example, nor by the inexplicable 
opposition of the clergy ; and, finally, it is the indefatiga- 
ble devotion of a beautiful life consecrated to the cause of 
instruction, which was a long series of efforts and sacrifices. 
At an early hour, La Salle had given proofs of the energy 
of his character. Weak and sickly, he was obliged to 
struggle against the infirmities of his constitution. To 
overcome sleep, and to prolong his studious vigils, he 
sometimes kneeled on sharp stones, and sometimes he placed 
in front of him, upon his study-table, a board fitted with 
iron points, against which his head would strike as soon as 
fatigue made him doze and he leaned forward. Canon of 
the chapter of Reims in 1667, ordained priest in 1678, he 
resigned his prebendship in 1683, and, voluntarily making 
himself poor, in order to approach those whose souls he 
would save, he renounced his whole patrimony, to the great 
disgust of his friends, who treated-him as a madman. 
280. Ascunic TenpEncius. — But it is not a disinterested 
love of the people, it is not the thought of their moral regen-

and sustained the efforts of La Salle. His purpose wae 
above all else religious. He pushed devotion even to asceti- 
eism. In his childhood, while-he still lived at home, he

came to have a sense of unrest in the parlors of his mother ; 
and one evening, as his biographers relate, while those about 
him were engaged in music, or were talking on worldly mat- 
ters, he threw himself into the arms of.one of his aunts, and 
said to her, ‘‘ Madam, relate to me the life of one of the 
saints.” He himself was a saint, though the Church did not 
think him worthy of this venerable title. In his youth he 
passed whole nights in prayer, and slept on boards. All his 
life he was severe to himself and also to others, considering 
abstinence and privations as the regimen of the Christian. 
His adversaries, at different times, imputed this to him as a 
crime. He was represented as a hardened man, puslfing his 
ascetic requirements to the extreme of cruelty. To appease 
their anger, he removed penances and bodily inflictions from 
his institution, but he maintained them for himself, and con- 
tinued his life of voluntary suffering. Heroic virtues, it may 
be; but it may be added also, an unfortunate disposition 
for a teacher of children. We distrust, in advance, a system 
of teaching whose beginning was so sad, whose founder 
inclosed his life within so narrow an horizon, and which, at 
first, was illuminated by no rays of gladness and good 
humor. 
281. Founpations or THE Inst1TUTE.-— The Institute of 
the Brethren was founded in 1684, but it was not sanctioned 
by pontifical authority and royal power till forty years later, 
in 1724. 
We shall not recite at full length the vicissitudes of the 
first years of the Institute. We simply state that La Salle 
inaugurated his work by offering hospitality in his own house 
to several poor teachers. In 1679 he opened at Reims a 
school for boys. In 1684 he imposed on his disciples vows 
of stability and obedience, and prescribed their costume. In 
1688 he went to Paris in order to found schools there, and
-P-A-G-E-293
CATHOLICISM AND PRIMARY INSTRUOTION. 261 
it was here in particular, as he himself says, that ‘he saw. 
himself persecuted by the men from whom he expected help.” 
In spite of all these difficulties his enterprise prospered, and 
when he died, in 1720, the Institute of the Brethren already 
counted a large number of establishments for primary in- 
struction. 
282. Tue Inia or Normat Scuoors.— We know how 
the teaching force was then recruited. In Paris, if we may 
believe Pourchot, the chief precentor, Claude Joly, was 
obliged to employ, for the direction of schools, old-clothes- 
men, innkeepers, cooks, masons, wig-makers,  puppet- 
players —the list might be continued. In 1682 Marie 
Moreau, a teacher, was sent by Bossuet to keep the school 
at Ferté-Gaucher. The rector of the place, in his capacity” 
as tutor (écoldtre), wishing to ascertain her competence, 
subjected her to an examination, of which the following is 
ap account s — 
‘¢1, He asked her if she could read, and she replied that 
she read passably well, but not well enough to teach. 
“©2. He gave her a pen to mend, and she declared that 
she could not do it. 
‘°3. He handed her a Latin book and requested her to 
read it, but she was prevented from making the attempt by 
sister Remy, who had just prévented her from exhibiting her 
writing.”! 
Ignorance, and often moral unfitnéss, was the general 
character of the teachers of that period. They often entered 
upon their duties without the least preparation. La Salle 
had too great. an anxiety for the good condition of his schools 
to accept improvised teachers. So in 1685 he opened at 
Reims, under the name of Seminary for Schoolmasters, a

262. THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
real normal school, in which teachers were to be trained for 
the rural districts. Only Démia had preeeded him in this 
work. Later he founded an establishment of the same kind 
in Paris, and—a thing worthy of note — he annexed to this 
normal school a primary school,.in which the teaching was 
done by the students in training under the direction of. an 
experienced teacher. 
In the third part of his Conduct of Schools La Salle has 
drawn up the rules for what he calls the training of new. 
masters. ere are the faults that he notices in young 
teachers : — . 
1. An itching to talk; 2. too great activity, which degen- 
erates into petulance ; 3. indifference; 4. preoccupation and 
embarrassment; 5. harshness; 6. spite; 7. partiality; 8. 
slowness and negligence ; 9. pusillanimity and lack of force ; 
10. despondency and fretfulness; 11. familiarity and 
trifling; 12. distractions and loss of time; 13. fickleness ; 
14. giddiness; 15. exclusiveness; 16. lack of attention to 
the different characters and dispositions of children. 
283. Tue Ipza or Gratuitous anp Osticarorr In- 
STRUCTION. -— The Institute of the Brethren of the Christian 
Schools, say the statutes of the order in so many words, is a 
society whose members make a profession to conduct schools 
gratuitously. ‘La Salle thought only of the children of 
artisans and of the poor, who, he said, being occupied 
during the whole day in earning their own livelihood and that 
of their families, could not give their children the instruction 
they need, and a respectable and Christian education.” In 
1694, the founder of the Institute and his first twelve disci- 
ples went and kneeled at the foot of the altar, and pledged 
themselves to ‘‘ conduct collectively and through organized 
effort schools of gratuitous instruction, even when, in order
-P-A-G-E-295
CATHOLICISM. AND PRIMARY INSTRUCTION. 263 
to do this, they might be obliged to ask alms and to live on 
bread alone.” 
But a thing still more remarkable than to have popular- 
ized gratuitous instruction, already realized in many places 
through charity schools, is to have formed the conception of 
obligatory instruction. La Salle, who did not believe that 
this was any encroachment on the liberty of parents, pro- 
poses, in this Conduct of Schools, a means for affecting their 
will: — 
‘«If among the poor there are certain ones who are unwill- 
ing to take advantage of the opportunities for instruction, 
they should be reported to the rectors. The latter will be 
able to cure them of their indifference by threatening to give 
them no more assistance till they send their children to 
school.” 
284. ProrgssionaL Insreuction. — Besides primary schools 
proper, La Salle, who is truly an innovator, inaugurated the 
organization of a technical and professional instruction. 
At Saint Yon, near Rouen, he organized a sort of college 
where was taught ‘all that a young man can learn, with 
the exception of Latin, and whose purpose was to prepare 
the student for commercial, industrial, and administrative 
occupations.” 
285, Conpucr or THE Curistran Scuoors: Successive 
Eprrions. — La Salle took the trouble to draw up for his 
Institute a very minute code of rules, with this title: The 
Conduct of Schools. The first edition bears the date of 
1720. It appeared at Avignon a year after the author’s 
death.! Two other editions have since appeared, in 1811 
and in 1870, with some important modifications. The sub-

bier, printer and bookseller, near the College of the Jesuits.

264 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
stance has not been changed, but certain passages relative 
to discipline, and to the use of the rod, haye been sup- 
pressed. 
‘With the view to adapt our education to the mildness of 
the present state of manners,” says the preface of 1811, 
‘*we have suppressed or modified whatever includes cor- 
poral correction, and have advantageously (sic) replaced 
this, on the one hand, by good marks, by promises and 
rewards, and on the other by bad marks, by deprivations 
and tasks.” 
On the other hand, some additions have been made. The 
Institute of the Brethren had to yield in part to the demands 
_ of the times, and to subtract something from the inflexi- 
bility of its government. 
<The Brethren,” it is said in the preface to the edition of 
1870, written by the Frére Philip, ‘‘ the Brethren have little 
by little enlarged the original Conduct, in proportion as 
they have perfected their methods. ... It is plain that a 
book of this kind cannot receive a final form. New experi- 
ments, progress in methods, legislative enactments, new 
needs, etc., require that it receive divers modifications from 
time to time.” 
286. AxsusE or Rreutations. — A feature common to the 
pedagogy of the Jesuits, and to that of the Brethren of the 
Christian Schools, is, that everything is regulated in advance 
with extraordinary exactness. No discretion is left to the 
teachers. . The instruction is but a rule in action. All nov- 
elty is interdicted. 
“It has been necessary,” says the Preface of La Salle, to 
prepare this Conduct of the Christian schools, ‘* to the end 
that there may be uniformity in all the schools, and in all 
the places where there are Brethren of the Institute, and 
that the methods employed may always be the same. Man

is so subject to slackness, and even to changeableness, that 
there must be written rules for him, in order to keep him 
within the bounds of his duty, and to prevent him from 
introducing something new, or from destroying that which 
has been wisely established.” 
Need we be astonished, after this, that the teaching of the © 
Brethren often became a useless routine? 
287. Drvision or tHE Conpuct.—The Conduct of the 
Christian Schools is divided into three parts. The first 
treats of all the exercises of the school, and of what is 
done in it from the time the pupils enter till they leave. 
The second describes the means for establishing and main- 
taining order; in a word, the discipline. The third treats of 
the duties of the inspector of schools, of the qualities of 
the teachers, and of the rules to be followed in the educa- 
tion of the teachers themselves. This may be called, so to 
speak, the manual of the normal schools of the Institute. 
288. Inventor ORGANIzaTION oF THE ScHOoLs. —That 
which first strikes the attention in the Christian Schools, 
such as La Salle organized, is the complete silence that 
reigns in them. Nothing is better than silence on the part 
of pupils, when it can be obtained, but La Salle enjoins 
silence on teachers as well. The Frére is a professor who 
does not talk. 
‘He will watch carefully over himself, to speak very 
rarely, and very low.” ‘It would be of but little use for 
the teacher to try to make his pupils keep silence if he does 
not do this himself.” ‘‘ When necessity obliges him to speak 
—and he is careful that this necessity is rare—he will 
always speak in a moderate tone.” 
It might be said that La Salle fears a strong and sono: 
rous voice. :
-P-A-G-E-298
266 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
How, then, shall the teacher communicate with his pupils, 
since he is almost debarred from the use of speech? La 
Salle has invented, to supersede language, a complete sys~ 
tem of signs, a sort of scholastic telegraphy, a long account 
of which will be found in several chapters of the Conduct. 
To have prayers repeated, the teacher will fold his hands ; 
to have the catechism repeated, he will make the sign of the 
cross. In other cases he will strike his breast, will look at 
the pupil steadily, ete. Besides, he will employ an instru- 
ment of iron named a signal, which he will raise or lower, 
and handle in a hundred ways, to indicate his wish, or to 
announce the beginning or the close of such or such an 
exercise. 
What is the meaning of this distrust of speech? And 
what are we to think of these schools of mutes where 
teachers and pupils proceed only by signs? When a scholar 
asks permission to speak, he will stand erect in his place, 
with hands crossed and eyes modestly lowered. Doubtless, 
to attempt to excuse these practices, we must consider the 
annoyances of a noisy scliool, and the advantages of a 
silent school where everything is done discreetly and noise- 
lessly. Is there not, however, in these odd regulations, 
something besides the desire for order and good conduct, — 
the revelation of a complete system of pedagogy which is 
afraid of life and liberty, and which, under the pretext of 
making the school quiet, deadens the school, and, in the 
end, reduces teachers and pupils to mere machines? 
289. Srmutraneous Instruction.—By the side of the 
evil we must note the good. Up to the time of La Sallie, 
the individual method was almost alone in use in primary 
instruction; but he substituted for this the simultaneous 
method, that is, teaching given to all the pupils at the same 
time. For this purpose, La Salle divided each sehool into
-P-A-G-E-299
CATHOLICISM AND PRIMARY INSTRUCTION. 267 
three divisions: ‘‘The division of the weakest, that of the 
mediocres, and that of the more intelligent or the more 
capable.” . : 
‘©All the scholars of the same order will receive the 
same lesson together. The instructor will see that all are 
attentive, and that, in reading for example, all read in a 
low voice what the teacher reads in a loud voice.” 
To aid the instructor, La Salle gives him one or two of 
the better pupils of each division, who become his assistants, 
and whom he calls inspectors. ‘‘The more children have 
taught,” said La Salle, ‘‘ the more they will learn.” 
To be just, however, we must recognize, in certain recom- 
mendations of La Salle, some desire to appeal to the judg- 
ment and the reason of the child : — 
“The teacher will not speak to the scholars during the 
catechism, as in preaching, but he will interrogate them 
almost continually by questions, direct or indirect, in order 
to make them comprehend that which he is teaching them.” 
The Frére Luccard, in his Life of the Venerable J. B. de 
La Salle, quotes this still more expressive passage, borrowed 
from his manuseript Counsels : — 
“Let the teacher be careful not to lend his pupils too 
much help in resolving the questions that have been proposed 
to them. He ought, on the contrary, to invite them not 
to be discouraged, but to. seek with ardor what he knows 
they will beable to find for themselves. He will convince 
them that they will the better retain the knowledge they 
have acquired by a personal and persevering effort.”

368 THE HISTORY oF PEDAGOGY. ° 
In reading, La Salle, agreeing in this respect with Port 
Royal, requires that French books be used in the beginning. 
‘¢ The book in which the pupil will begin to learn Latin is 
the Psalter; but this lesson will be given only to those who 
can readily read in French.” 
La Salle requires that the pupil shall not be exercised in 
writing till ‘‘he can read perfectly.” He attaches, more- 
over, an extreme importance to calligraphy, and it is known 
that the Brethren have remained masters in this art. La 
Salle does not weary in giving advice on this subject: the 
pens, the knife for mending them, the ink, the paper, the 
tracing-papers and blotters, round letters and italic letters 
(a‘bastard script), ~ everything is passed in review.'| The 
Conduct also insists ‘‘on the manner of teaching the proper 
posture of the body” and “on the manner of teaching how 
to hold the pen and the paper.” 
*< Tt will be useful and timely in the beginning to give the 
pupil a stick of the bigness of a pen, on which there are three 
notches, two on the right and one on the left, to mark the 
places where his fingers should be put.”’ 
The exercises in writing are to be followed by exercises in 
orthography and in composition : — 
‘* The teacher will require the pupils to compose and write 
for themselves notes, receipts, bills, ete. He will also 
require them to write out what they remember of the cate- 
chism, and of the lectures that they have heard.” ? 
As to arithmetic, reduced to the. four rules, we must 
commend La Salle’s attempt to have it learned by reason 
and not by routine. Thus, he requires the teacher to inter- 
rogate the pupil, in order to make him the better comprehend 
  1 The use of the round script was in fashion. La Salle introduced the 
bastard hand.

and retain the. rnle, or to make sure that he is attentive. He 
«cwill give him a complete understanding” of what he 
teaches; and,. finally, he will require him ‘“‘to produce a 
certain number of rules that he has discovered for himself.” 
Prayers and religious exercises naturally hold a large place 
in the schools organized by La Salle : — 
‘¢There shall always be two or three scholars kneeling, 
one from each class, who will tell their beads one -after 
another.” 
<¢ Care will everywhere be taken that the scholars hear the 
holy mass every day.” 
‘cA half hour each day shall be devoted to the cate- 
chism.”’ 
291. Mernop or Tracuinc.—The Institute of: the 
Brethren has often been criticised for the mechanical char- 
acter of its instruction. The Frére Philip, in the edition of 
the Conduct published in 1870, implicitly acknowledges the 
‘justice of this criticism when he writes: ‘+ Elementary 
instruction has assumed a particular character in these last 
days, of which we must take account. Proposing for its 
chief end to train the judgment of the pupil, it gives less 
importance than heretofore to the culture of the memory; it 
makes especial use of methods which call into activity the 
intelligence, and lead the child to reflect, to take account of 
facts, to withdraw from the domain of words to enter into 
that of ideas.” Do not these wise cautions unmistakably 
betray the existence of an evil tradition which should be 
corrected, but which tends to hold its ground? He who has 
read the Conduct is not left in doubt that the general char- 
acter of the pedagogy of the Christian Schools, at the first, 
was a mechanical and routine exercise of the memory, and 
the absence of life.
-P-A-G-E-302
270 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
292. Cumistian Porreness. — Under the title of Rules 
of Decorum and Christian Civility, La Salle had composed a 
reading book, intended for pupils already somewhat ad- 
vanced, and printed in Gothic characters. It was not only 
a manual of politeness, but was, the Conduct claims, a 
treatise on ethics, ‘‘ containing all the duties of children, 
both towards God and towards their parents.”” But we 
would examine the work in vain for the justification of this 
remark. In it are discussed only the puerile details of out- 
ward behavior and of worldly bearing. It would, however, 
be in bad taste to criticise at this day a book of another age, 
whose artlessness makes us smile. La Salle’s purpose was 
certainly praiseworthy, though attempting a little too much. 
It is said in the Preface that ‘‘there is not a single one of 
eur actions which ought not to be regulated by motives 
purely Christian.” Hence an infinite number of minute 
prescriptions upon the simplest acts of daily life.? 
But here are a few specimens of this pretended elementary 
ethics : — 
“It is not proper to talk when one has retired, the bed 
being made for rest.” 
‘¢Qne should try to make no noise and not to snore while 
asleep ; nor should-one often turn from side to side in bed as 
if he were restless and did not know on which side to lie.” 
« Tt is not becoming, when one is in company, to take off 
one’s shoes.” 
  1 We have before us the sixth edition of this work: Rouen, 1729. La 
Salle had written it towards the year 1703. 
* 2 See, for example, the following chapters: upon the nose and the manner 
ef using the handkerchief and of sneezing (chap. vii.); upon the ‘back, the 
shoulders, the arms, and the elbow (chap. viii.); on the manner ‘in which 
one ought to behave with respect to the bones, the sauce, and the fruit 
(chap; vi., of the second part); on the manner of behaving while walking 
in the streets, on journeys, in carriages, and on horseback (chap. x.),
-P-A-G-E-303
OATHOLICISM AND PRIMARY INSTRUCTION. 271 
*¢ Ft is impolite to play with a stick or a cane, and to ugg 
jt to strike the ground or pebbles, etc., etc.” 
How many mistakes in politeness we should make every 
day of our lives if the rules of La Salle were infallible! 
293. Corporat CuastiseMents. —The Brethren, within 
two centuries, have singularly ameliorated their system of cor- 
rection. ‘‘ Imperative circwmstances,’’ said the Frére Philip 
in 1870, ‘“‘no longer permit us to tolerate corporal punish- 
ment in our schools.” Already, in 1811, there was talk of . 
suppressing entirely, or at least modifying, the use of these 
punishments. The instruments of torture were perfected. 
‘We reduce the heavy ferule, the inconvenience of which 
hes been only too often felt, to a simple piece of leather, 
about a foot long and an inch wide, and slit in two, at one 
end; still we hope that by divine help and by the mildness 
of our very dear and dearly beloved colleagues, they will 
make use of it only in cases of unavoidable necessity, and 
only to give a stroke with it on the hand, without the per- 
mission ever to make any other use of it.” 
But at first, and in the original Conduct, corporal pun- 
ishment is freely permitted and regulated with exactness. 
La Salle distinguished five sorts of corrections, — repri- 
mand, penances, the ferule, the rod, expulsion from school. 
294. Reprimanps. — Silence, we have seen, is the funda- 
mental rule of La Salle’s schools: ‘¢ There must be as little 
speaking as possible. Consequently, corrections by word of 
mouth are very rarely to be employed.” It even seems, 
adds the Conduct, that ‘it is much better not to use them 
at all”! 
A curious system of discipline, verily, where it is as good 
  1 Bee the edition of 1720, from page 140 to page 180.
-P-A-G-E-304
272 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. . 
as forbidden to resort to admonitions, to severe reprimands. 
to an appeal through speech to the reason and the feelings of 
the child; where, consequently, there is no place for the 
moral authority of the teacher, but where there is at once 
invoked the ultima ratio of constraint and violence, of the 
ferule and the rod ! 
295. Penances. — La Salle recommends penanzes as well 
as corporal corrections. By this term he means punishments 
like the following: maintaining a kneeling posture in the 
school; learning a few pages of the catechism by heart ; 
‘+ holding his book before his eyes for the space of half an 
hour without looking off ;” keeping motionless, with clasped 
hands and downcast eyes, ete. , 
296. THE FeRvLE. — We have not to discuss in this place 
the use of material means of correction. The Brethren 
themselves have repudiated them. Only it is provoking 
that they bow to what they call ‘‘ imperative circumstances,” 
and not to considerations based on principles. But it is 
interesting, were it only from an historical point of view, to 
recall the minute prescriptions of the founder of the Order. 
’ The Conduct first describes the ferule, ‘‘an instrament 
formed of two pieces of leather sewed together; it shall be 
from ten to twelve inches long, including the handle; the 
palm shall be oval, and two inches in diameter; the 
palm shall be lined on the inside so as not to be wholly flat, 
but rounded to fit the hand.” Nothing is overlooked, we 
observe ; the form of the ferule is officially defined. But 
what shocks us still more is the nature of the faults that 
provoke the application of the ferule: ‘1. for not having 
attended to the lesson, or for having played; 2. for being 
tardy at school; 3. for not having obeyed the first signal.” 
It is true that La Salle, always preoccupied with writing,
-P-A-G-E-305
CATHOLICISM AND PRIMARY INSTRUCTION. 278 
orders the ferule to be applied only to the left hand; the 
right hand shall always be spared. The child, moreover, is 
not to cry while he receives the ferule; if he does, he is to 
be punished and corrected anew. 
297. Tur Rop. —In the penal code of La Salle, the cate- 
gories of faults worthy of punishment are sharply defined. . 
‘The rod shall be employed for the following faults: 1. re- 
fusal to obey ; 2. when the pupil has formed the habit of not 
giving heed to the lesson; 3. when he has made blots upon 
his paper instead of writing; 4. when he has had a fight with 
his comrades; 5. when he has neglected his prayers in 
ehurch; 6. when he bas been wanting in “ modesty’? at 
mass or during the catechism; 7. when he has been absent 
from school, from mass, or from the catechism. 
Even supposing that the principle of the rod is admissible, 
we must still condemn the wrong use which La Salle makes 
of it, for faults manifestly out of proportion to such a chas- 
tisement. 
I very well know that the author of the Conduct requires 
that corrections shall be rare; but could he be obeyed, when 
he put into the hands of his teachers scarcely any other 
means of discipline? 
But to comprehend to what extent La Salle forgot what is 
due to the dignity of the child, and considered him as a 
machine, without any regard to the delicacy of his feelings, 
with no respect for his person, we must read to the end the 
strange prescriptions of this manual of the rod. The pre- 
cautions that La Salle exacts make still more evident the 
impropriety of such punishments :— 
s¢ When the teacher would punish a scholar with the rod, 
he will make the ordinary sign to summon the attention of 
the school; next he will indicate by means of the signal the
-P-A-G-E-306
214 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY, 
decree which the pupil has violated, and then show him the 
place where correction is ordinarily administered; and he 
will at once go there, and will prepare to receive the punish- 
ment, standing in such a way as not to be seen indecently 
by any one. This practice of having the scholar prepare 
himself for receiying the correction, without any need on the 
part of the teacher of putting his hand upon him, shall be 
very exactly observed, 
‘‘ While the scholar is preparing himself to receive the cor- 
rection, the teacher shall be making an inward preparation 
to give it in a spirit of love, and in a clear view of God. 
Then he will go from his desk with dignity and gravity. 
«© And when he shall have reached the place where the 
scholar is” (it is stated, moreover, that this place should be in 
one of the most remote and most obscure parts of the school, 
. where the nakedness of the victim cannot be seen), ‘‘he will 
speak a few words to him to prepare him to receive the cor- 
rection with humility, submission, and a purpose of amend- 
ment; then he will strike three blows as is usual; to go 
beyond five blows, there would be needed a special order of 
the director. 
_ “He shall be careful not to put his hand on the scholar. 
If the scholar is not ready, he shall return to his desk with- 
out saying a word; and when he returns, he shall give him 
the most severe punishment allowed without special permis- 
sion, that is, five blows. 
‘* When a teacher shall have thus been obliged to compel a 
scholar to receive correction, he shall attempt in some way 
a little time afterwards to make him see and acknowledge 
his fault, and shall make him come to himself, and give him 
a strong and sincere resolution never to allow himself again 
to fall into such.a revolt.”
-P-A-G-E-307
CATHOLICISM AND PRIMARY INsiRbeTION. 275 
Tle‘ moment is perhaps not well chosen to preach a’ 
sermon and to violate the rule whick forbids the Brethreii 
the use of the reprimand. 
‘After the scholar has been corrécted, he will modestly 
kneel in the middle of the room before the teacher; with 
artas crossed, to thank him for havirig corrected him; and 
will then turn towards the crucifix to thank God for it, and 
to promise Him at the same time not again to commit the 
fault for which he had just been corrected. This he will do 
without speaking aloud; after which the teacher will give 
him the sign to go to his place.” 
Is it possible to have a higher misconception of human 
nature, to trifle more ingeniously with the pride of the child, 
and with his most legitimate feelings, and to mingle, in the 
most repulsive manner, indiscreet and infamous practices 
with the exhibition of religious sentiments? 
‘Tt is absurd,” says Kant, ‘ to require the children whom 
we punish to thank us, to kiss our hands, ete. This is to 
try to make servile creatures of them.” 
To justify La Salle, some quotations from his works have 
been invoked. 
‘For the love of God, do not use blows of the hand. 
Be very careful never to give children a blow.” 
But it is necessary to know the exact thought of the 
author of the Conduct, and this explains the following 
passage : — 
** No corrections should be employed save those which are 
in use in the schools; and so scholars should never be struck 
with the hand or the foot.” 
In other words, the teacher should never strike except 
with the authorized instruments, and according to the official 
regulations,
-P-A-G-E-308
276 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
298. Muruan Esprronace.—- We may say without exag- 
geration that the Conduct recommends mutual espionage : — 
“The inspector of schools shall -be careful to appoint 
one of the most prudent scholars to observe those who make 
a noise ‘while they assemble, and this scholar shall then 
report to the teacher what has occurred, without allowing the 
others to know of it.” 
299. Rewarps. — While La Salle devotes more than forty 
pages to corrections, the chapter on rewards comprises two 
small pages. 
Rewards shall be given ‘ from time to time.” They shall 
pe of three kinds: rewards for piety, for ability, and for 
diligence. They shall consist of books, pictures, plaster 
casts, crucifix and virgin, chaplets, engraved texts, etc. 
800. Conciusion.— We have said enough ‘to give an 
exact idea of the Institute of the Christian Brethren in its 
primitive form. Its faults were certainly grave, and we can- 
not approve the general spirit of those establishments for 
education where pupils are forbidden ‘‘ to joke while they 
are at meals” ; to give anything whatsoever to one another ; 
where children are to enter the school-room so deliberately 
and quietly that the noise of their footsteps is not heard ; 
where teachers are forbidden ‘‘to be familiar” with the 
pupils, ‘* to allow themselves to descend to anything com- 
mon, as it would be to langh...” But whatever the dis- 
tance which separates those gloomy schools from our modern 
ideal, — from the pleasant, active, animated school, such as 
we conceive it to-day, — there is none the less obligation to 
do justice to La Salle; to pardon him for the practices which 
were those of his time, and to admire him for the good 
qualities that were peculiarly his own. The criticism that is
-P-A-G-E-309
CATHOLICISM AND PRIMARY INSTRUCTION. 277. 
truly fruitful, is that which is especially directed to the 
good, without caviling at the bad.? 
(301. Awaryrica, Summary.— 1. This study exhibits the 
zeal of the Catholic Church in the education of the children 
of the poor. The motive was not the spirit.of domination, 
as in the case of the Jesuits, but a sincere desire to engage 
in a humane work. 
2. A proof of the multiplication of schools, and 86 of the 
diffusion of the new educational spirit, is the wretched 
quality of those who were allowed to teach. There must be 
schools even if they are poor ones. 
8. The need of competent teachers led to the establish- 
ment of the Teachers’ Seminary, the parent of the modern 
normal school. The two elements in this professional 
instruction seem to have been a knowledge of the subjects 
to be taught and of methods of organization and discipline. 
4, The severe discipline and enforced silence of La Salle’s 
schools permit the inference that the school of the period 
was the scene of lawlessness and disorder. The reaction 
went to an extreme; but considering the times, this excess 
was a virtue. . : 
5. The scarcity of teachers and the abundance of pupils 
led to the expedient of mutual and simultaneous instruction. 
While this method is absolutely bad, it was relatively good. 
6. ‘To the benevolent and inventive spirit of La Salle is 
due the organization of industrial schools. ] 
  
2 The influence of the teaching congregations in general, and of this one 
in particular, on public education as administered by the State, is very 
strikingly exhibited by Meunier in his Lutte du Principe Clérical et du 
Principe Laique dans 0 Enseignement (Paris: 1861). There is also inter- 
esting information concerning La Salle. See particularly the introductory

802... Tae Pepacocy or tHe Ercntrenta Century. — 
The most striking of the general characteristics of French 
pedagogy in the eighteenth century, is that in it the lay spirit 
comes into mortal collision with the ecclesiastical spirit. 
What a contrast between the clerical preceptors of the seven- 
teenth. century and the philosophical educators of the eight- 
eenth! The Jesuits, all-powerful under Louis XIV., are 
to be decried, condemned, and finally expelled in 1762, 
The first place in the theory and in the practice of education 
will belong to laymen. Rousseau is to write the Emile. 
D’Alembert and Diderot will be the educational advisers of 
the Empress of Russia, The parliamentarians, La Chalotais
-P-A-G-E-311
ROUSSEAU AND THE &MiLE: ‘279 
and Rolland, will attempt to substitute for the action of tlie 
Jesuits the action of the State, or, at least, one of the powers 
of the State. Finally, with the Revolution, the lay spirit 
will succeed in triumphing. 
Again, the pedagogy of the eighteenth century is distin- 
guished by its critical and reformatory tendencies. The 
century of Louis XIV. is, in general, a century of content; 
the century of Voltaire, a century of discontent. 
Besides, the philosophical spirit, which associates the 
theory of education with the laws of the human spirit, which 
is not content to modify routine by a few ameliorations of 
detail, which establishes general principles and aspires to an 
ideal perfection, — the philosophical spirit, with its excel- 
lencies and with its defects, — will come to the light in the 
Emile, and in some other writings of the same period. 
Finally, and this last characteristic is but the consequence 
of the others, education tends to become national, and at the 
same time humane. Preparation for life replaces preparation 
for death. During the whole of the eighteenth century, a 
conception is in process of elaboration which the men of the 
Revolution will exhibit in its true light, — that of an educa-- 
tion, public and national, which makes citizens, which works 
for country and for real life. 
303. Precursors or Roussnav. —The greatest educational 
event of the eighteenth century, before the expulsion of the 
Jesuits and the events of the French Revolution, is the pub- 
lication of the Emile. Rousseau is undeniably the first in 
rank among the founders of French pedagogy, and his influ- 
ence will be felt abroad, especially in Germany. But what- 
aver may be the originality of the author of the Emile, his 
system is not a stroke of genius for which no preparation 
had been made. He had his precursors, and he profited by 
their works. A Benedictine, who might have spent hie

strength to better advantage, has written a book on tha 
Plagiarisms of J. J. Rousseau.+ 
We do not propose to treat Rousseau as a plagiarist, for he 
surely has inspiration of his own, and his own boldness in 
invention ; but however much of an innovator he may be, he 
was inspired by Montaigne, by Locke, and without speaking 
of those great masters whom he often imitated, he had his 
immediate predecessors, whose ideas on certain points are in- 
conformity with his own. 
304. Tur Asp pe Sart Pierre (1 ese — Among 
the precursors of Rousseau, a place among the first must be 
assigned to the Abbé de Saint Pierre, a dreamy, fantastic 
spirit, fitted more to excite curiosity than to deserve admir- 
ation, whom Rousseau himself called ‘‘a man of great pro- 
jects and petty views.” His projects in fact were great, 
at least in number. Between ‘‘a project to make sermons 
more useful, and a project to make roads more passable,’ 
there came, in his incoherent and varied work, several pro- 
‘jects for perfecting education in general, and the education 
of girls in particular. 
The dominant idea of the Abbé de Saint Pierre is his 
anxiety in behalf of moral education. In proportion as we 
advance towards the era of liberty, we shall notice a grow- 
ing interest in the development of the moral virtues. 
The Abbé de Saint Pierre requires of man four. essential 
qualities : justice, benevolence, the discernment of virtue or 
judgment, and, lastly, instruction, which holds but the lowest 
rank. Virtue is of more worth than the knowledge of Latin. 
s+ It cannot be said that a great knowledge of Latin is not 
an excellent attainment; but in order to acquire this knowl-

edge, it is necessary to give to it an amount of time that 
‘would be incomparably better employed .in acquiring great 
skill in the observation of prudence. Those who direct edu- 
cation make a very great mistake in employing tenfold too 
much time in making us scholarly in the Latin tongue, and 
in employing tenfold too little of it in giving us a confirmed 
use of prudence.”? 
But what are the means proposed by the Abbé de Saint 
Pierre? All that he has devised for organizing the teaching 
of the social virtues is reduced to the requirement of reading 
edifying narratives, of playing moral pieces, and of accus- 
toming young people to do meritorious acts in the daily inter- 
course of the school. When the lessons have been recited 
and the written exercises corrected, the teacher will say to 
the pupil: ‘‘ Do for me an act of prudence, or of justice, or 
of benevolence.” This is easier to say than to do. College 
life scarcely furnishes occasion for the application of the 
social virtues. 
But the Abbé de Saint Pierre should be credited with his 
good intentions. He is the first in France to give his thought 
to this matter of professional instruction. The mechanic 
arts, the positive sciences, the apprenticeship to trades, — 
these things he places above the study of languages. Around 
his college, and even in his college, there are to be mills, 
printing offices, agricultural implements, garden tools, ete. 
Was it not also an idea at once new and wise, to establish 
a continuous department of public instruction, a sort of per- 
manent council, charged with the reformation of methods 
and with establishing, as far as possible, uniformity in all 
the colleges of the kingdom? 
Finally, we shall commend the Abbé de Saint Pierre. for 
having persistently urged the necessity of the education of

women. From Fénelon to the Abbé de Saint Pierre, from 
1680 to 1730, great progress was made in this question. We 
seem already to hear Condorcet when we read the following 
passage :— 
‘‘The purpose should be to instruct girls in the elements 
of all the sciences and of all the arts which can enter into 
ordinary conversation, and even in several things which re- 
late to the different employments of men, such as the history 
of their country, geography, police regulations, and the prin- 
cipal civil laws, to the end that they can listen with pleasure to 
what men shall say to them, ask relevant questions, and easily 
keep up a conversation with their husbands on the daily 
occurrences in their occupations.” 
For the purpose of sooner attaining his end, the Abbé de 
Saint Pierre, anticipating the centuries, demanded for women 
national establishments, colleges of secondary instruction. 
He did not hesitate to cloister young girls in boarding-schools, 
and in boarding-schools without vacations ; and he entreated 
the State to organize public courses for those who, he said, 
‘* constitute one-half of the families in society.” 
805. Orner Insprrers or Rousszav.— With the eight- 
eenth century there begins for modern thought, in education 
as in everything else, an era of international relations, of 
mutual imitation, of the action and reaction of people on 
people. The Frenchman of the seventeenth centuty had al- 
most absolutely ignored Comenius. Roussgau knows Locke, 
and also the Hollander Crousaz,'whom, by the way, he treats 
tather shabbily, speaking of him as ‘‘the pedant Crousaz.” 
Crousaz, however, had ‘some good ideas. He criticised 
the old methods, which make ‘‘of the knowledge of Latin

and Greek the principal part of education” ; and he preached 
scientific instruction and moral education. 
In the Spectacle of Nature, which was so popular in its 
day, the Abbé Pluche also demanded that the study of the 
dead languages should be abridged’: — 
‘< Experience with the pitiable Latinity which reigns in the 
colleges of Germany, Flanders, Holland, and in all places 
where the habit of always speaking Latin is current, suffices 
to make us renounce this custom which prevents a young 
man from speaking his own tongue correctly.” 
The Abbé Pluche demanded that the time saved from 
Latin be devoted to the living languages. On the other 
hand, he insisted on early education, and on this point he 
was the complement to his master, Rollin, who, he said, 
wrote rather ‘‘for the perfection of studies than for their 
beginning.” 
Still other writers were able to suggest to Rousseau some 
of the ideas which he developed in the Emile. Before him, 
La Condamine declared that the Fables of La Fontaine are 
above the capacity of children.? Before him, Bonneval, much 
interested in physical education, violently criticised the use of - 
long clothes, and claimed for children an education of the 
senses. He demanded, besides, that in early instruction, the 
effort of the teacher should be limited to the keeping of evil 
impressions from the childish imagination, and that instruc- 
tion in the truths of religion should be held in abeyance. 
We shall discover in the Hmile all these ideas in outline 
revived and developed with the power and with the brilliancy 
of genius, sometimes transformed into boisterous paradoxes, 
but sometimes, also, transformed into solid and lasting 
truths.

284 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
306. Pustication or ran Exti: (1762).—Rousseau has 
made striking statements of nearly all the problems of edu- 
cation, and he has sometimes resolved them with wisdom, 
and always with originality. 
Appearing in 1762, at the moment when the Parliament 
was excluding the Jesuits from France, the Emile came at 
the right moment in that grand overthrow of routine and 
tradition to disclose new hopes to humanity, and to announce 
the advent of philosophic reason in the art of educating men. 
But Rousseau, in writing his book, did not think of the 
Jesuits, of whom he scarcely speaks; he wrote, not for the 
man of the present, but for the future of humanity ; he com. 
posed a book endowed with endless vitality, half romance, 
half essay, the grandest monument of human thought on the 
subject: of education. The Emile, in fact, is not a work of 
ephemeral polemics, nor simply a practical manual of peda- 
gogy, but is a general system of education, a treatise on 
psychology and moral training, a profound analysis of human 
nature. 
307. Was Rousseav PREPARED TO BECOME A TEACHER ?— 
Before entering upon the study of the Emile, it is well to 
inquire how the author had been prepared by his character 
and by his mode of life to become a teacher. The history of 
French literature offers nothing more extraordinary than the 
life of Jean Jacques Rousseau. Everything is strange in the 
destiny of that unfortunate great man. Rousseau com- 
mitted great faults, especially in his youth; but at other 
moments of his life he is almost a sage, a hero of private 
virtues and civic courage. He traversed all adventures and 
all trades. Workman, servant, charlatan, preceptor, all in 
turn; he lodged in garrets at a son, and experienced days 
when he complained that bread was too dear. Through all
-P-A-G-E-317
‘ROUSSEAU AND THE SMILE. 285 
these wiseries and these humiliations a soul was in process 
of formation made up, above all else, of sensibility and 
imagination. 
Rousseau’s sensibility was extreme. The child who, 
unjustly treated, experienced one of those violent fits of 
passion which he has so well described in his Confessions, 
aud who writhed a whole night in his bed, erying ‘ Carnifex, 
carnifex!” was surely not an ordinary child. ‘I had no 
idea of things, but all varieties of feeling were already 
known to me. I had conceived nothing; I had felt every- 
thing.” Even a mediocre representation of Alzire made him 
beside himself, and he refused witnessing the play of trage- 
dies for fear of becoming ill. 
The sentiment of nature early inspired him with a passion 
which was not to be quenched. His philosophic optimism 
and his faith in providence were never forgotten. Other 
pure and generous emotions filled his soul. The study of 
Plutarch had inspired him with a taste for republican virtues 
and with an enthusiasm for liberty. Falsehood caused him 
a veritable horror. He had the feeling of equity in a high 
degree. Later, to the hatred of injustice there was joined in 
his heart an implacable resentment against the oppressors of 
the people.. He had doubtless received the first germ of this 
hate when, making the journey afoot from Paris to Lyons, 
he entered the cabin of a poor peasant, and there found, as 
in a picture, the affecting summary of the miseries of the 
people. 
At the same time he was an insatiable reader. He nour- 
ished himself on the poets, historians, and philosophers of 
antiquity, and he studied the mathematics and astronomy. 
As some one has said, ‘‘ That life of reading and toil, inter- 
rupted by so many romantic incidents and adventurous 
undertakings; had vivified his imagination as a regular course
-P-A-G-E-318
386 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
of study in the College of Plessis could not possibly have 
done.” : 
It is in this way that his literary genius was formed, and, 
_in due order, his genius for pedagogy. We need not seek in 
the life of Rousseau any direct preparation for the composi- 
tion of the Emile. It is true that for atime he had been 
preceptor, in 1739, in the family of Mably, but he soon 
resigned duties in which he was not successful. A little 
essay which he composed in 17401 does not yet give proof 
of any great originality. On the other hand, if he loved to 
observe children, he observed, alas, only the children of 
others. There is nothing sadder than that page of the Confes- 
sions in which he relates how he often placed himself at the 
window to observe the dismission of school, in order to Hsten 
to the conversations of children as a furtive and unseen 
observer ! 
The Emile is thus less the result of a patient induction and 
of a real experience than a work of inspiration or a brilliant 
improvisation of genius. 
308. GexeraL Principtes or THE Exore.—A certain 
number of general principles run through the entire work, and 
give it a systematic form and a positive character. 
The first of these is the idea of the innocence and of the 
perfect goodness of the child. The Emile opens with this 
solemn declaration : — 
‘s Everything is good as it comes from the hands of the 
Author of nature; everything degenerates in the hands of 
man.” And in another place, ‘‘ Let us assume as an incon- 
testable maxim that the first movements of nature are always 
right’; there is ‘no original perversity in the human heart.” 
Without doubt Rousseau was right in opposing the pessi- 
    
2 Projet pour l'éducation de M. de Sie-Marie.
-P-A-G-E-319
ROUSSEAU AND THE £MILE, 28t 
mism of those who see in the child a being thoroughly wickéd . 
and degraded before birth; he is deceived in turn when he 
affirms that there is no germ of evil in human nature. 
Society is wicked and corrupt, he says, and it is from 
society that all the evil comes; it is from its pernicious 
influence that the soul of the child must be preserved! But, 
we reply, how did society itself happen to be spoiled and 
vitiated?- It is nothing but a collection of men; and if the 
individuals are innocent, how can the aggregate of individu- 
als be wicked and perverse? But let the contradictions of 
Rousseau pass; the important thing to note is that from his 
optimism are derived the essential characteristics of the 
education which he devises for Emile. This education will 
be at once natural and negative : — 
« Emile,” says Gréard, “is a child of nature, brought up 
by nature, according to the rules of nature, for the satisfac- 
tion of the needs of nature. This sophism is not merely in- 
scribed at random on the frontispiece of the book, but is its 
very soul; and it is by reason of this sophistry that, sepa- 
tated from the body-of reflections and maxims that give it so 
powerful an interest, Rousseau’s plan of education is but a 
dangerous chimera.” 
Everything that society has established, Rousseau con- 
demns in a lump as fictitious and artificial. -Conventional 
usages he despises; and he. places Emile at the school of 
nature, and brings him up almost like a savage. 
On the other hand, the education of Emile is negative, at 
least till his twelfth year; that is, Rousseau lets nature have 
her way till then. _ For those who think nature evil, educa- 
tion ought to be a work of compression and of repression. 
But nature is good; and so education consists simply in let- 
ting her have free course. To guard the child from the shock 
of opinions, to form‘ betimes a defence about. his soul, to

assure against every exterior influence the frge development 
of his faculties —such is the end that he proposes to himself. 
Another general principle of the Emile, another. trath 
which Rousseau’s spirit of paradox quickly transferms into 
error, is the idea of the distinction of ages: — 
‘Each age, each state of life, has its proper perfection, 
and a sort of maturity which is its own. We have often 
heard of a man grown; but let us think of a child grown. 
That sight will be newer to us, and perhaps not less agree- 
able.” 
«*We do not know infancy. With the false ideas we have, 
the further we go, the more we are astray. The most learned 
give their attention to that which it is important for men to 
know without considering what children are in a condition to 
comprehend. They always look for the man in the child, 
without thinking of what he was before he became a man.” 
«‘ Everything is right so far, and from these observations 
there proceeds a progressive education, exactly conforming 
in its successive requirements to the progress of the faculties. 
But Rousseau does not stop in his course, and he goes be- 
yond progressive education to recommend an education in 
fragments, so to speak, which isolates the faculties in order 
to develop them one after another, which establishes an abso- 
lute line of demarkation between the different ages, and 
which ends in distinguishing three stages of progress in the 
soul. Rousseau’s error on this point is in forgetting that 
the education of the child ought to prepare for the education 
of the young man. Instead of considering the-different ages 
9g the several rings of one and the same chain, he separates 
them sharply from one another. He does not admit that 
marvelloug unity of the human soul, which seemg go strong in 
man only because God has, so to speak, woven its bands inte 
the child and there fastened them.” (Gréard),

: 809. Rowanric Cuaracter or Taz Esitx.-—~A final ob- 
servation is necessary before entering into an analysis of the 
- Emile ; it-is that in this, as in his other works, Rousseau. is 
not averse to affecting singularities, and with deliberation 
and effrontery to break with received opinions. . Doubtless we. 
should not go so far as to say with certain critics that the 
Enmile is rather the feat of a'wit than the serious expression 
of a grave and serious thought; but what it is impossible. 
not to grant is that which Rousseau himself admits in his 
preface: “One will believe that he is reading, not so much 
a book on education as the reveries of a visionary.” Emile, 
in fact, is.an imaginary being whom Rousseau places in strange 
conditions. He does not give him parents, but has him 
brought up by a preceptor in the country, far from all society. 
Emile is a character in a romance rather than a real man. 
' 810. Divison of tHe Worx. — Without doubt, there 
are in the Emile long passages and digressions that make the 
reading of it more agreeable and its analysis more difficult. 
But, notwithstanding all this, the author confines himself to, 
a methodical plan, at least to a chronological order. The 
different ages of Fimile serve as a principle for the division 
of the work. The first two books treat especially of the in-. 
fant and of the earliest period of life up to the age of twelve., 
The only question here discussed is the education of the body 
and the exercise of the senses. The third book corresponds 
to the period of intellectual education, from the twelfth to 
the fifteenth year. In the fourth book, Rousseau studies 
moral education, from the fifteenth to the twentieth year. _ 
_ Finally, the fifth book, in which the romantic spirit is still 
rampant, is devoted to the education of woman.

tive to the eilucation of the mind and the heart. Rousseau 
has purposely eliminated from the first twelve years of the 
child’s life everything which concerns instruction and moral 
discipline. At the age of twelve, Emile will know how to 
run, jump, and judge of distances; but he will be perfectly 
ignorant. The idea would be that he has studied nothing aé 
all, and ‘‘ that he has not learned to distinguish his right 
hand from his left.” 
The exclusive characteristic of Emile’s education, during 
this first period, is, then, the preoccupation with physical 
devela@pment and with the training of the senses. 
Out of many errors, we shall see displayed some admirable 
flashes of good sense, and grand truths inspired by the prin~ 
ciple of nature. 
812. Ler Narure HAVE HER Way.— What does nature 
flemand? She demands that the child have liberty of move- 
ment, and that nothing interfere with the nascent activities 
of his limbs. What do we do, on the contrary? We put 
him in swaddling clothes ; we imprison him. | He is deformed 
by his over-tight garments, —the first chains that are imposed 
on a being who is destined to have so many others to bear! 
On this subject, the bad humor of Rousseau does not tire. 
He is prodigal in outbreaks of spirit, often witty, and some- 
times ridiculous, 
** Jt seems,” he says, ‘¢as though we fear that the child 
may appear to be alive.” ‘‘Man is born, lives, and dies, in a 
state of slavery; at his birth he is stitched into swaddling- 
clothes; at his death he is nailed in his coffin; and as long 
as he preserves the human form he is held captive by our 
institutions.” 
. We shall not dwell on these extravagances of language 
which transforms s, coffin and a child’s long-clothes into insti-

futions, The protests of Rousseau have contributed towards 
areformation of usages; but, even on this point, with his 
great principle that everything must be referred to nature, 
because whatever nature does she does well, the author of 
Emile is on the point of going astray. No more for the 
body than for the mind is nature sufficient in herself; she 
must have help and watchful assistance. ‘Strong supports 
are needed to prevent too active movements and dangerous. 
strains of the body ; just as, later on, there will be needed a 
vigorous moral authority to moderate and curb the passions 
of the soul. 
313. Tae Morner To nurse HER OWN CHILDREN. ~— But 
there is another point where it has become trite to praise 
Rousseau, and where his teaching should be accepted without 
reserve. This is when he strongly protests against the use 
of hired nurses, and when he eloquently sammons mothers 
to the duties of nursing their own children. Where there is 
no mother, there is no child, says Rousseau, and he adds, 
where there is no mother, there is no family! ‘+ Would you 
recall each one to his first duties? Begin with the mothers. 
You will be astonished at the changes you will produce!” 
It would be to fall into platitudes to set forth, after Rous- 
seau, and after so many others, the reasons which recom- 
mend nursing by the mother. We merely observe that 
Rousseau insists on this, especially on moral grounds. It is 
not merely the health of the child; it is the virtue and the 
niorality of the family; it is. the digrity of the home, that he 
wishes to defend and preserve. And, in fact, how many 
other duties are provided for and made easier by the per- 
formance of a primal duty. 
314. Harpeninc or THE Bopy.—So far, the lessons of 
nature have instructed Rousseau. He is stili right when he

292 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
‘wishes Emile to grow hardy, to become inured to privations, 
to become accustomed at an early hour to pain, and te 
learn how to suffer; but from being a stoic, Rousseau soon 
becomes a cynic. Contempt for pain gives place to a con- 
tempt for proprieties. mile shall be a barefoot, like Dioge-. 
nes. Locke gives his pupil thin shoes; Rousseau, surpassing 
him, completely abolishes shoes. He would also like to 
- suppress all the inventions of civilization. Thus Emile, 
accustomed to walk in the dark, will do without candles. 
“I would rather have Emile with eyes at the ends of his 
fingers than in the shop of a candle-maker.” All this tempts 
us to laugh; but here are graver errors. Rousseau objects 
to vaccination, and proscribes medicine. Emile is fore- 
handed. He is in duty bound to be well. A physician will 
be summoned only when he is in danger of death. Again, 
Rousseau forbids the washing of the new-born child in wine, 
because wine is a fermented liquor, and nature produces 
nothing that is fermented. And so there must be no play- 
things made by the hand of man. A twig of a tree or a 
poppy-head will suffice. Rousseau, as we see, by reason of 
his wish to make of his pupil a man of nature, brings him 
into singular likeness with the wild man, and assimilates 
him almost to the brute. 
815. Neaative Epucation. —It is evident that the first 
period of life is that in which the use of negative education 
is both the least dangerous and the most acceptable. Ordi- 
narily, Emile’s preceptor will be but the inactive witness, 
the passive spectator of the work done by nature. Had 
Rousseau gone to the full length of his system, he ought to 
have abolished the preceptor himself, in order to allow the 
child to make his way all alone. But if the preceptor is 
_ tolerated, it is not to act directly on Emile, it is not to per
-P-A-G-E-325
ROUSSEAU AND TH AMtiE. 298 
form thé duties of a professor, in teaching him what it is 
important for a child to know ; but it is simply to put him in 
the way of the discoveries which he ought to make for himself 
in the wide domain of nature, and to arrange and to combine, 
artificially and laboriously, those complicated scenes which 
are intended to replace the lessons of ordinary education. 
Such, for éxample, is the scene of the juggler, where Emile 
is to acquire at the same time notions on physics and on 
ethics. Such, again, is the conversation with the gardener, 
Robert, who reveals to him the idea of property. The pre- 
ceptor is no longer a teacher, but a mechanic. The true 
educator is nature, but nature prepared and skillfully ad- 
justed to serve the ends that we propose to attain. Rousseau’ 
admits only the teaching of things : — 
‘Do not give your pupil any kind of verbal lesson; he 
should receive none save from experience.” ‘‘The most 
important, the most useful rule in all education,.is not to 
gain time, but to lose it.” LO 
The preceptor will interfere at most only by a few timid 
and guarded words, to aid the child in interpreting the les- 
sons of nature. ‘‘State questions within his comprehension, 
and leave him to resolve them for himself. Let him not 
know aiything because you have told it to him, but because 
he has comprehended it for himself.” 
“For the body as for the mind, the child must be left to 
himself.” : 
‘¢ Let him rim, and frolic, and fall a hunated times a day. 
So much the better; for he will learn from this the sooner to 
help himself up. The welfare of liberty atones for many 
bruises.” 
In his horror for what he calls ‘‘ the teaching and pedantic 
mania,” Rousseau goes so far as to proscribe an education 
in habits : —_ ,
-P-A-G-E-326
294 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
“The only habit that a child should be allowed to form 
is to contract no habit.” 
316. Tue Cump’s Ricur ro Harrryess.— Rousseau did 
not tire of demanding that we should respect the infancy that 
is in the child, and take into account his tastes and his apti- 
tudes. With what eloquence he claims for him the right of 
being happy ! 
“Love childhood. Encourage its sports, its pleasures, and 
its instinct for happiness. Who of you has not sometimes 
regretted that period when a laugh was always on the lips, 
and the soul always in peace? Why will you deny those 
little innocents the enjoyment of that brief period which is so 
soon to escape them, and of that precious good which they 
cannot abuse? Why will you fill with bitterness and sorrow 
those first years so quickly passing which will no more re- 
turn to them than they can return to you? Fathers, do you 
know the moment when death awaits your children? Do 
not Jay up for yourselves regrets by depriving them of the 
few moments that nature gives them. As soon as they can 
feel the pleasure of existence, try to have them enjoy it, and 
act in such a way that at whatever hour God summons them 
they may not die without having tasted the sweetness of 
living.” 
317. ProscrreTion Or InrettectuaL Exercises. — Rous- 
seau rejects from the education of Emile all the intellectual 
exercises ordinarily employed. He proscribes history on the 
’ pretext that Emile cannot comprehend the relations of events. 
He takes as an example the disgust of a child who had been 
told the anecdote of Alexander and his physician : — 
*©T found that he had an unusual admiration for the cour- 
age, so much lauded, of Alexander. But do you know in 
qhat he saw that courage? Simply in the fact that he 
fwallowed a drink that had a bad taste.” :
-P-A-G-E-327
ROUSSEAU AND THE SMILE. 295 
And from-this Rousseau concludes that the child’s intelli- 
gence is not sufliciently open to comprehend history, and that 
he ought not to learn it. The paradox is evident. Because 
Emile is sometimes exposed to the danger of falling into 
errors of judgment, must he be denied the opportunity of 
judging? Similarly, Rousseau does not permit the study of: 
the languages. Up to the age of twelve, Emile shall know 
but one language, because, till then, incapable of judging and 
comprehending, he cannot make the comparison between 
other languages and his own. Later, from twelve to fifteen, 
Rousseau will find still other reasons for excluding the study 
of the ancient languages. And it is not only history and the 
languages; it is literature in general from which Emile is 
excluded by Roussean. No book shall be put into his hands, 
not even the Fables of La Fontaine. It is well known with 
what resolution Rousseau criticises The Crow and the Fox. 
818. Epucarion or THe SEnses. — The grand preoccupa- 
tion of Rousseau is the exercise and development of the 
senses of his pupil. The whole theory of object lessons, and 
even all the exaggerations of what is now called the intuitive 
method, are contained in germ in the Emile: — 
‘¢ The first faculties which are formed and perfected in us 
are the senses. _ These, then, are the first: which should be 
cultivated ; but these are the very ones that we forget or that 
we neglect the most.” 
Rousseau does not consider the senses as wholly formed 
by nature; but he makes a special search for the means of 
forming them and of perfecting them through education. 
** To call into exercise the senses, is, so to speak, to Jearn 
to feel; for we can neither touch, nor see, nor hear, except as 
we have been taught.” 
Only, Rousseau is wrong in sacrificing everything to this
-P-A-G-E-328
296 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
education of the senses, He sharply criticises this favorite 
maxim of Locke, ‘‘ We must reason with children.”. Rous- 
seau retards the education of the judgment and the reason, 
and declares that ‘t he would as soon require that a child be 
five feet high as that he reason at the age of eight.” 
319. Tax Tarp Boox or tae Exe. —From the twelftn 
to the fifteenth year is the length of time that Rousseau has 
devoted to study and to intellectual development proper. It 
is necessary that the robust animal, ‘‘ the roe-buck,” as he 
calls Emile, after a negative and temporizing education of 
twelve years, become in three years an enlightened intelli- 
gence. As the period is short, Rousseau disposes of the time 
for instruction with a miser’s hand. Moreover, Emile is very 
poorly prepared for the rapid studies which are to be im- 
posed on him. Not having acquired in his earlier years the 
habit of thinking, having lived a purely physical existence, he 
will have great difficulty in bringing to life, within a few 
months, his intellectual facu}ties. 
But without dwelling on the unfavorable conditions of 
Emile’s intellectual education, let us see in what it will 
consist. 
820. CHorcE IN THE THINGS TO BE TAUGHT. —The princi- 
ple which guides Rousseau in the choice of Emile’s studies 
is no other than the principle of utility :— 
‘¢ There is a choice in the things which ought to be taught as 
‘well as in the time fit for learning them. Of the knowledges 
within our reach, some are false, others are useless, and still 
others serve to nourish the pride of him who has them. Only 
the small number of those which really contribute to our good 
are worthy the care of a wise man, and conéequently of a 
child whom we wish to render such. It is not a question of 
knowing what is, but only what is useful.”
-P-A-G-E-329
ROUSSEAU AND THE SMILE.’ 897 
821, Rovsszav anp THz Ape pe Sant Prerre.— Among 
educators, some wish to teach everything, while others deé 
mand a choice, and would retain only what is necessary. 
The Abbé de Saint Pierre follows the first tendency. He 
would have the scholar learn everything at college; a little 
medicine towards the seventh or eighth year, and in the 
other classes, arithmetic and blazonry, jurisprudence, Ger- 
man, Italian, dancing, declamation, politics, ethics, astron- 
omy, anatomy, chemistry, without counting drawing and the 
violin, and twenty other things besides. Rousseau is wiser. 
He is dismayed at such an accumulation, at such an obstruc- 
tion of studies, and so yields too much to the opposite ten- 
dency, and restricts beyond measure the list of necessary 
studies. . 
322. Eye's Sropmes. — These, in fact, are the studies to 
which Emile is limited: first, the physical sciences, and, at 
the head of the list, astronomy, then geography, geography 
taught without maps and by means of travel : — . 
‘You are looking for globes, spheres, maps. What 
machines! Why all these representations? Why not begin 
by showing him the object itself?” 
Here, as in other places, Rousseau prefers what would be 
best, but what is impossible, to that which is worth less, but 
which alone is practicable. 
But Rousseau does not wish that his pupil, like the pupil cf 
_ Rabelais, become an ‘‘ abyss of knowledge.” 
««When I see a man, enamored of knowledge, allow him- 
self to yield to its charms, and run from one kind to another 
without knowing where to stop, I think I see a child on the 
sea-shore collecting shells, beginning by loading himself with 
them ; then; tempted by those he still sees, throwing them 
aside, picking them up, until, weighed down by their number,
-P-A-G-E-330
298 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
and no longer knowing which to choose, he ends by rejecting 
everything, and returns empty-handed.” 
No account is made of grammar and the ancient languages 
in the plan of Emile’s studies. Graver still, history is pro- 
scribed. This rejection of historical studies, moreover, is 
systematically done. Rousseau has placed Emile in the 
country, and has made him an orphan, the better to isolate 
him; to teach him history would be to throw him back into 
society that he abominates. 
323. No Booxrs save Rosinson Crusoz.—One of the con- 
sequences of an education that is natural and negative is the 
suppression of books. Always going to.extremes, Rousseau 
is not content to criticise the abuse of books. He deter- 
mines that up to his fifth year Emile shall not know what a 
‘book is : — : 
‘«T hate books,” he exclaims; ‘‘ they teach us merely to 
speak of things that we do not know.” 
Besides the fact that this raving is rather ridiculous in the 
case of a man who is a writer by profession, it is evident that 
Rousseau is roving at random when he condemns the use of 
books in instruction. 
One book, however, one single book, has found favor in 
his sight. Robinson Crusoe will constitute by itself for a long 
time the whole of Emile’s library. We understand without 
difficulty Rousseau’s kindly feeling for a work which, under 
the form of a romance, is, like the Emile, a treatise on natu- 
ral education. Emile and Robinson strongly resemble each 
other, since they are self-sufficient and dispense with 
society. 
324, Excertent Precepts on Mernop. — At least in the 
general method which he commends, Rousseau makes amends 
for the errors in his plan of study: — _ :
-P-A-G-E-331
ROUSSEAU AND THE EMILE. 299 
48Do not treat the child to discourses which he cannot 
understand. No descriptions, no eloquence, no figures of 
speech. Be content to present to him appropriate objects. 
Let us transform our sensations into ideas. But let us not 
jump at once from sensible objects to intellectual objects. 
Let us always proceed slowly from one sensible ‘notion to 
another. In general, let us never substitute the sign for the 
thing, except when it is impossible for us to show the 
thing.” 
“T have no love whatever for explanations and talk. 
Things! things! I-shall never tire of saying that we ascribe 
foo much importance to words. With our babbling education 
we make only babblers.” 
But the whole would bear quoting. Almost all of Rous- 
seau’s recommendations, in the way of method, contain an 
element of truth, and need only to be modified in order to 
become excellent. 
825. Exctustve Motives or Action. — A great question 
in the education of children is to know to what motive we 
shall address ourselves. Here again, Rousseau is exclusive 
and absolute. Up to the age of twelve, Emile will have 
been guided by necessity ; he will have been made depend- 
ent on things, not on men. It is through the possible and 
the impossible that he will have been conducted, by treating 
him, not as a sensible and intelligent being, but as a force of 
nature against which other forces are made to act. Not till 
the age of twelve must this system be changed. Emile has 
now acquired some judgment; and it is upon an intellectual 
motive that one ought now to count in regulating his con- 
duct. This motive is utility. The feeling of emulation can- 
not be employed in a solitary. education, Finally, at the 
age of fifteen, it will be possible to appeal to the heart, te

800 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
feeling, and-to recommend to the young man the acts we set 
before him, no. longer as necessary or useful, but as noble, 
good, and generous. The error of Rousseau is in cutting 
_ up the life of man to his twentieth year into three sharply 
defined parts, into three moments, each subordinated to a 
single governing principle. The truth is that at eyery age 
an appeal must be made to all the motives that act on our 
will, that at every age, necessity, interest, sentiment, and 
finally, the idea of duty, an idea too often overlooked by. 
Rousseau, as all else that is derived from reason, — all these 
motives can effectively intervene, in different degrees, in the 
education of man. . 
326. mite Learns a TrapE. — At the age of fifteen, 
Emile will know nothing of history, nothing of humanity, 
nothing of art and literature, nothing of God; but he will 
know a trade, a manual trade. By this means, he will be 
sheltered from need in advance, in case a revolution should 
strip him of his fortune. 
‘¢ We are approaching,” says Rousseau, with an astonish- 
ing perspicacity, ‘¢a century of revolutions. Who can give 
you assurance of what will then become of you? I hold it 
to be impossible for the great monarchies of Europe to last 
much longer. They have all had their day of glory, and 
every State that dazzles is in its decline.” 
We have previously noticed, in studying analogous ideas in 
the case of Locke, for what other reasons Rousseau made of 
Emile an apprentice to a cabinet-maker or a carpenter. 
827. Kame at rae Ace or Frrreen. — Rousseau. takes 
comfort in the contemplation of his work, and he pauses 
.from time to time in his analyses and deductions, to trace 
the portrait of his pupil. This is how he represents him at 
the age-of fifteen: —~ oe
-P-A-G-E-333
“ROUSSEAU AND THE &MTLE.- 304 
_ © Ermile has but little knowledge, but that which he has ia 
really his own; he knows nothing by halves. In the small 
number of things that he knows, and knows well, the most 
important is that there are many things which he does not 
know, but which he can some day learn; that there are many ~ 
more things which other men know, but which he will never 
know ; and that there is an infinity of other things which no 
man will ever know. He has a universal mind, not through 
actual knowledge, but through the ability to acquire it. He 
has a mind that is open, intelligent, prepared for everything, 
and, a8 Montaigne says, if not instructed, at least capable 
of being instructed. It is sufficient for me that he knows 
how to find the of what good is it? with reference to all that 
he does, and the why? of all that he believes. Once more, 
my object is not at all to give him knowledge, but to teach 
him how to acquire it as he may need it, to make him esti- 
mate it at its exact worth, and to make him love truth above 
everything else. With this method, progress is slow; but 
there are no false steps, and no danger of being Obliged to 
retrace one’s course.” 
All this is well; but it is necessary to add that even Emile 
has faults, great faults. To mention but one of them, but 
one which dominates all the others, he sees things only from 
the point of view of utility, and he would not hesitate, for 
example, “ to give the Academy of Sciences for the smallest 
bit of pastry.” 
328. Epvcation of tHe Sensipiitizs. — It is true that 
Rousseau finally decides. to make of Emile an affectionate 
and reasonable being. ‘‘ We have formed,” he says, ‘‘ his 
body, his senses, his judgment; it remains to give him a 
heart.” Rousseau, who proceeds like a magician, by wave of 
wand and clever tricks, flatters himself that within a. day’s
-P-A-G-E-334
302 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
time Emile is going to become the most affectionate, the 
most moral, and the most religious of men. 
329. Tue Fourra Boox or tHe Ewme.— The develop- 
ment of the affectionate sentiments, the culture of the moral 
sentiment, and that of the religious sentiment, such is the 
triple subject of the fourth book, — vast and exalted questions 
that lend themselves to eloquence in such a way that the 
fourth book of the Emile is perhaps the most brilliant of the 
whole work. : : 
330. GuNESIS OF THH AFFECTIONATE SENTIMENTS. — Here 
Rousseau is wholly in the land of chimeras. Enile, who 
lives in isolation, who has neither family, friends, nor com- 
panions, is necessarily condemned to selfishness, and every- 
thing Rousseau can do to warm his heart will be useless. 
Do we wish to develop the feelings of tenderness and affec- 
tion? Let us begin by placing the child under family or 
social influences which alone can furnish his affections the 
occasion for development. For fifteen years Rousseau leaves 
the heart of Emile unoccupied. What an illusion to think 
he will be able to fill it all at once! When we suppress the 
mother in the education of a child, all the means that we can 
invent to excite in his soul emotions of gentleness and 
affection are but palliatives. Rousseau made the mistake of 
‘thinking that a child can be taught to love as he is taught to 
read and write, and that lessons could be given to mile in 
feeling just as lessons are given to him in geometry. 
331. Morat Epvcation.—Rousseau is more worthy of 
being followed when he demands that. the moral notions of 
right and wrong have their first source in the feelings of sym- 
pathy and social benevolence, on the supposition that accord- 
ing to his system he can inspire Emile with such feelings.
-P-A-G-E-335
  | ROUSSEAU AND THE SMILE. 308 
<¢ We enter, finally, the domain of morals,” he says. ‘If 
this were the place for it, I would show how from the first 
emotions of the heart arise the first utterances of the con- 
science, and how, from the first feelings of love and hate 
arise the first notions of good and evil. I would make it 
appear that justice and goodness are not merely abstract 
terms, conceived by the understanding, but real affections 
of the soul enlightened by the reason.” 
Yes; let the child be made to make his way gradually 
towards a severe morality, sanctioned by the reason, in 
having him pass through the gentle emotions of the heart. 
Nothing can be better. But this is to be done on one condi- 
tion: this is, that we shall not stop on the way, and tbat the 
vague inspirations of the sensibilities shall be succeeded by 
the exact prescriptions of the reason. Now Rousseau, as 
we know, was never willing to admit that virtue was anything 
else than an affair of the heart. His ethics is wholly an 
ethics of sentiment. 
332. Reticious Epvucation. -— We know the reasons which 
determined Rousseau to delay till the sixteenth or eighteenth 
year the revelation of religion. It is that the child, with his’ 
sensitive imagination, is necessarily an idolater. If we 
speak to him of God, he can form but a superstitious idea of 
him. ‘' Now,” says Rousseau, pithily, ‘when the imagina- 
tion has once seen God, it is very rate that the understanding 
conceives him.” In other terms, once plunged in supersti- 
tion, the mind of the child can never extricate itself from it. 
We must then wait, in the interest of religion itself, till the 
child have sufficient maturity of reason and sufficient power 
of thought to seize in its truth, divested of every veil of 
sense, the idea of God, whose existence is announced to him | 
for the first time.
-P-A-G-E-336
804: THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
It: is diffieult to justify Rousseau. First, is it not to be 
feared that the child, if he has reached his eighteenth year in 
ignorance of God, may find it wholly natural to be ignorant 
of him still, and that he reason and dispute at.random with 
his .teacher, and that he doubt instead of believe? And. if 
he allows himself to be convinced, is it not at least evident 
that the religious idea, tardily inculeated, will have no pro- 
found hold on his mind? On the other hand, will the child, 
with his instinctive curiosity, wait till his eighteenth year to 
inquire the cause of the universe? Will he not form the 
notion of a God in his own way? 
‘One might have read, a few years ago,” says Villemain, 
“the account, or rather the psychological confession, of a. 
writer (Sentenis), a German philosopher, whom his father 
had submitted to the experiment advised by the author of 
Emile. Left alone by the loss of a tenderly loved wife, this 
‘father, a learned and thoughtful man, had taken his infant 
son to a retired place in the country; and not allowing him 
communication with any one, he had cultivated the child’s 
intelligence through ‘the sight of the natural objects. placed 
near him, and by the study of the languages, almost without 
books, and in carefully concealing from him all idea of God. 
The child had reached his tenth year without having either 
read or heard that great name. But then his mind found 
what had been denied it. The sun which he saw rise each 
morning seemed the all-powerful benefactor of whom he felt 
the need. He soon formed the habit of going at dawn to the 
garden to pay homage to that god that he had made for 
himself. His father surprised him one day, and showed him 
his error by teaching him that all the fixed stars are so many 
suns distributed in space. But such was. then the disap- 
pointment.and the grief of the child deprived of his worship,

that the father, overcome, acknowledged to him that there 
was a God, the Creator of the heavens and the earth.” ! 
333. Tur Savoyarp Vicar’s Proresston or Farra. — 
Rousseau has at least attempted to retrieve, by stately lan- 
guage and an impassioned demonstration of the existence of 
God, the delay which he has spontaneously imposed on his 
pupil. 
The Savoyard Vicar’s Profession of Faith is an eloquent 
catechism on natural religion, and the honest expression of a 
sincere and profound deism. The religion of nature is evi- 
dently the only one which, in Rousseau’s system, can be 
taught, and ought to be taught, to the child, since the child is 
exactly the pupil of nature. If Emile wishes to go beyond 
this, if he needs a positive religion, this shall be for himself 
‘0 choose. 
334. Sopnre anp Tae Epucatron or Women. —'The weak- 
est part of the Emile is that which treats of the education of 
woman. This is not merely because Rousseau, with his 
‘decided leaning towards the romantic, leads Emile and his 
companion into odd and extraordinary adventures, but it is 
especially because he misconceives the proper dignity of 
woman. Sophie, the perfect woman, has been educated only 
to complete the happiness of Emile. Her education is wholly 
relative to her destiny as a wife. 
‘+The whole education of women should be relative to men 5 
to please them, to be useful to them, to make themselves 
honored and loved by them, to educate the young, to care for 
the older, to advise them, to console them, to make life agree- 
able and sweet to them, — these are the duties of women in 
every age.” ——- 
1 Report, of Villemain on the work of the Pére Girard (1844).
-P-A-G-E-338
306 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
: “Sophie,” says Gréard, ‘‘ has but virtues of the second 
order, virtues of conjugal educaticn.” It has been said that 
inarriage is a second birth for man, that he rises or falls 
according to the choice which he makes. For woman, ac- 
cording to the theory of Rousseau, it is the true advent into 
life. According to the expressive formula of Michelet, who, 
in a sentence, has given a marvellous summary of the’ doc- 
trine, but in attaching to it a sense which poetizes it, ‘* the 
husband creates the wife.” Sophie, up to the day of her 
marriage, did not exist. She had learned nothing and read 
nothing ‘‘ except a Baréme and a Télémaque which have 
chanced to fall into her hands.” She has been definitely 
admonished, ‘‘ that were men sensible, every lettered girl 
will remain a girl.” Itis Emile alone who is to instruct her, 
and he will instruct her and mould her into his own ideal, 
and in conformity to his individual interest. 
* While it was only in his youth that he received the first 
principles of the religious feeling, Sophie must be penetrated 
with it from infancy, in order that she may early form the 
habit of submission. He commands and she obeys, the first 
duty of the wife being meekness. If, during her youth, she 
has freely attended banquets, amusements, balls, the theatre, 
it is not so much to be initiated into the vain pleasures of 
the world, under the tutelage of a vigilant mother, as to be- 
long, once married, more fully to her home and to her 
husband. She is nothing except as she is by his side, or as 
dependent on him, or as acting through him. Strange and 
brutal paradox, which Rousseau, it is true, corrects and 
repairs in detail, at every moment by the most happy and 
charming inconsistencies.” 
Sophie, briefly, is an incomplete person whom Rousseau is 
not careful enough to educate for herself. 
In her subordinate and inferior position, the cares of the
-P-A-G-E-339
ROUSSEAU AND THE &MILE: 307 
household occupy the largest place. She cuts and makes 
her own dresses : — , 
‘¢ What Sophie knows best; and what was taught her with 
most care, is the work of her sex. There is no needle-work 
which she does not know how to make.” 
It is not forbidden her, but is even recommended that-she 
introduce a certain coquetry into her employments : — 
‘*The work she loves the best is lace-making, because 
there'is no other that gives her a more agreeable attitude, 
and in which the fingers are used with more grace and 
deftness.” 
She carries daintiness a little too far: — 
‘+ She does not love cooking ; its details have some disgust 
for her. She would sooner let the whole dinner go into. the 
fire than to soil her cuffs.” 
Truly this is fine housewifery! We feel that we have here 
to do with a character in a romance who has no need to dine. 
Sophie would not have been well received at Saint Cyr, where 
Madame de Maintenon so severely scolded the girls who were 
too fastidious, ‘‘ fearing smoke, dust, and disagreeable odors, 
even to making complaints and grimaces on their account as 
though all were lost.” : 
335. Guneras Conctusion. —In order to form a just esti- 
mate of the Hmile, it is necessary to put aside the impressions . 
left by the reading of the last pages. We must consider as 
a whole, and without taking details into account, that work, 
which, notwithstanding all, is very admirable and profound. 
It is injured by analysis. To esteem the Hiile at its real 
worth, it must be read entire. In reading it, in fact, we are 
warmed by contact with the passion which Rousseau puts into 
whatever he writes. We pardon his errors and chimeras by 
reason of the grand sentiments and the grand truths which 
.we meet at every step. We must also take into account the

time when Rousseau lived, and the conditions under which he 
wrote. We have not a doubt that had it been written thirty 
years later, in the dawn of the Revolution, for a people who 
were free, or who desired to be free, the Emile would have 
been wholly different from what itis. Had he been working 
for a republican society, or for a society that wished to become 
such, Rousseau would not have thrown himself, out of 
hatred for the reality, into the absurdities of an over-spe- 
vialized and exceptional education. We can judge of what 
he would have done as legislator of public instruction in the 
time of the Revolution, by what he wrote in his Considerations 
on the Government of Poland : — : 
‘6 National education belongs only to people who are 
free... . Itis education which is to give to men the national 
mould, and so to direct their opinions and their tastes that 
they will become patriots by inclination, by passion, and by 
necessity” (we would only add, by duty). ‘A child, in 
opening his eyes, ought to see his country and nothing but 
his country. Every true republican, along with his mother’s 
milk, will imbibe love of country, that is, of law and liberty. 
This love constitutes his whole existence. He sees but his 
‘country, he lives but for her. So soon as he is alone, he is 
nothing ; so soon as there is no more of country, he is no 
more.... While learning to read, I would have a child of 
Poland read what relates to his country ; at the age of ten, I 
would have him know all its productions; at twelve, all its 
provinces, all its roads, all its cities ; at fifteen, the whole of 
its history ; and at sixteen, all its laws; and there should not 
be in all Poland a notable deed or an illustrious man, of which 
his memory and his heart were not full.” 
336. Ixriuence or THe Emits. — That which proves 
better than any commentary can the high standing of the 
Emile, is the success which it has obtained, the influence
-P-A-G-E-341
. ROUSSEAU AND THE SMILE. ‘309 
which it has exerted, both in France and abroad, and the 
durable renown attested by so many works designed, either 
to contradict it, to correct it, or to approve it and to dis- 
seminate its doctrines. During the twenty-five years that 
followed the publication of the Emile, there appeared in the 
French language twice as many books on education as. dur- 
ing the first sixty years of the century. “Rousseau, besides 
all that he said personally which was just and new; had the 
merit of stimulating minds and of preparing through his 
impulsion the rich educational harvest of this last one hun- 
dred years. 
To be convinced of this, it suffices to read this judgment 
of Kant :— . ‘ 
‘¢ The first impression which a reader who does not read 
for vanity or for killing time derives from the writings of 
Rousseau, is that this writer unites to an admirable penetra- 
tion of genius a noble inspiration and a soul full of sensi- 
bility, such as has never been met with in any other writer, 
in any other time, or in any other country. The impression 
which immediately follows this, is that of astonishment 
caused by the extraordinary and paradoxical thoughts which 
he develops. ... I ought to read and re-read Rousseau, 
till the beauty of his style no more affects me. It is only 
then that I can adjust my reason to judge of him.’’ 
[337. Awatyrica, Summary.—1. The study of the Emile 
exhibits, in a very striking manner, the contrast between the 
respective agencies of art and nature in the work of educa- 
tion, and also the power of sentiment as a motor to ideas. 
2. What Monsieur Compayré has happily called Rous- 
seau’s ‘“‘ misuse of the principle of nature” marks a recoil 
against the artificial and fictitious state of society and opinion 
in France in the eighteenth century. In politics, in religion, 
and in philosophy, there was the domination of authority, and

‘but a small margin was left for the exercise of freedom, 
versatility, and individual initiative; while education was 
administered rather as a process of manufacture, than of 
regulated growth. 
3. The conception that the child, by his very constitution, 
is predetermined, like plants and animals, to a progressive 
development quite independent of artificial aid, easily degen- 
erates into the hypothesis that the typical education is a 
process of spontaneous growth. 
4, The error in this hypothesis is that of exagger: ation or 
of disproportion. Education is neither a work of nature 
alone; nor of art alone, but is a natural process, supple- 
mented, controlled, and perfected by human art. What 
education would become when abandoned wholly to ‘‘ nature” 
‘may be seen .in the state of a perfected fruit which has been 
allowed to revert to its primitive or natural condition. 
5. Man is distinguished from all other creatures by the 
fact that he is not the victim of. his environment, but is en- 
dowed with the power to control his environment, almost to 
re-create it, and so to rise superior to it. This ability gives 
rise to human art, which is a codrdinate factor with nature 
in the work of education. 
6. This convenient fiction of ‘‘ Nature,” conceived as an 
infallible and incomparable. guide in education, has intro- 
duced countless errors into educational theory ; and Miss E. R. 
Sill is amply justified in saying that ‘* probably nine-tenths 
of the popular sophistries on the subject of education, would 
be cleared away by clarifying the word Nature.”* 
7. In spite of its paradoxes, its exaggerations, its over- 
‘wrought sentiment, and florid declamation, the Emile, in its 
general spirit, is a work of incomparable power and of per- 
ennial value.]

338, Tue Parosopners of Tar Ergureentn Century.— 
If there has been considerable progress made in education in 
the eighteenth century, it is due, in great part, to the efforts 
of the philosophers of that age, It is no longer alone the 
men who are actually engaged in the schools that are pre- 
occupied with education; but nearly all the illustrious 
thinkers of the eighteenth century have discussed these great 
questions with more or less thoroughness. The subject is 
far from being exhausted by the study of Rousseau. Besides 
the educational current set in movement by the Emile, the 
other philosophers of that period, in their isolated and inde-

Condillac is far from having the same authority in matters 
pertaining to education ; but still there is profit to be derived 
from the reading of his Course of Study, which includes not 
less than thirteen volumes. This important work is a collec- 
tion of the lessons which he had composed for the education 
of the infant Ferdinand, the grandson of Louis XV., and 
heir of the dukedom of Parma, whose preceptor he became 
in 1757. 
840. Asusx or THE Puosopuic Spier. —It is certainly 
a matter of congratulation that the philosophical spirit is 
entering more and more largely into the theories of educa- 
tion, and there would be only words of commendation for 
Condillac had he restricted himself to this excellent declara- 
tion, that pedagogy is nothing if. it is not.a deduction from 
psychology. But he does not stop there, but with an indis- 
eretion that is to be regretted, he arbitrarily transports into 
education certain philosophical principles’ which it is not 
proper to apply to the art of educating men, whatever may 
be their theoretical truth ; thus Condillac, having established 
the natural order of the development of the sciences and the 
arts in the history of humanity, presumes to impose the same 
law of progress upon the child. 
‘¢ The method which I have followed does not resemble the 
usual manner of teaching; but it is the very way in which 
men were led to create the arts and the sciences.” 4

In other terms, the child must do over again, on his.own 
account, ‘‘ that which the race has done.”” He must be com- 
pelled to follow, step by step, in its long gropings, the slor 
progress made by the race.? 
There is, doubtless, an element of truth in the error of 
Condillac. The sciences and the arts began with the obser- 
vation of particulars, and thence slowly rose to general prin- 
ciples ; and to-day no one thinks of denying the necessity of 
proceeding in the same manner in education, so far as this is 
possible. It is well at the first to present facts to the child, 
and to lead him step by step, from observation to observatiou, 
to the law which governs them and includes them ; but there is 
a wide distance between the discreet use of the inductive and 
experimental method, and the exaggerations of Condillae. 
No one should seriously think of absolutely suppressing the 
synthetic method of exposition, which, taking advantage of 
the work accomplished through the centuries, teaches at the 
outset the traths that have been already acquired. It would 
be absurd to compel the child painfully to recommence the 
toil of the race.” 
1 This is also the main principle in Mr. Spencer’s educational philosophy. 
“The education of the child must accord both in mode and arrangement 
with the education of mankind as considered historically ; or, in other 
words, the genesis of knowledge in the individual must follow the same 
course as the genesis of knowledge in the race.” — Education, p. 122. (P.) 
2 The general law of human progress is inheritance supplemented by 
individual acquisition. Using the symbols i (inheritance) and @ (acqui- 
sition), the progress of the race from its origin upwards, through successive 
generations, may be exhibited by this series: 7; i+a; ¢(2a)+a;i(8a)+4; 
i(4a)+a. If the factor of inheritance could be eliminated, as Condillac 
and Spencer recommend, the series would take this form: a’; a’; a’"; 
alv; av: the successive increments in acquisition being due to successive 
increments in power gained through heredity. But, happily, the law of in- 
heritance cannot be abrogated, and so philosophers write books in order te 
fave succeeding generations from the fate of Sisyphus. (P.) _

“814 “THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. : °° 
Graver still, Condillac, led astray by his love for philoso. 
phizing, presumes to initiate the child, from the very begin. 
ning of his studies, into psychological analysis. 
‘« The first thing to be done is to make the child acquainted 
with the faculties of his soul, and to make. him feel the need 
of making use of them.” 
- In other terms, the analysis of the soul shall be the first 
object proposed to the reflection of the child. It is noi 
proposed to make him attentive, but to teach him what 
attention is. 
How can one seriously think of making of the child a little 
psychologist, and of choosing as the first element of his edu- 
cation the very science that is the most difficult of all, the 
one which can be but the coronation of his studies? 
841. Musr wE REASON witH CHILDREN?— Rousseau had 
sharply criticised the famous maxim of Locke: ‘‘We musi 
reason with children.” Condillac tries to restore it to credit, 
and for this purpose he invokes the pretended demonstra- 
tions of a superficial and inexact psychology. 
“Tt has been proved,” he says, ‘‘that the faculty of 
reasoning begins as soon as the senses commence to de- 
velop; and we have the early use of our senses only because 
we early began, to reason.” Strange assertions, which are 
disproved by the most elementary observation of the facts in 
the case. Condillac here allows himself to be imposed upor 
by his sensational psychology, the tendency of which is to 
efface the peculiar character of the different intellectual 
faculties, to derive them all from the senses, and, conse 
quently, to suppress the distance which separates a simple: 
. Sensation from the subtile, reflective, and abstract process 
which is called reasoning. It cannot be admitted for 5 
single instant that the faculties of the understanding are, ai 
he says, ‘‘the same in the child as in the mature man."
-P-A-G-E-347
PHILOSOPHERS OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY. 815 
There is, doubtless, in the child a beginning of reasoning, a” 
sort of instinctive logic; but this infantile reasoning can be 
applied only to familiar objects, such as are sensible and 
concrete. It were absurd to employ it on general and ab- 
stract ideas. : 
342. Pretounary Lxessons.—We shall quote, without 
comment, the first subjects of instruction which, under the 
title of Legons préliminaires, Condillac proposes to his 
pupil: 1, the nature of ideas; 2. the operations of the 
soul; 8. the habits; 4. the difference between the soul and 
the body; 5. the knowledge of God. 
How are we to conceive that Condillac had the pretension 
to place these high philosophical speculations within the 
reach of a child of seven years who has not yet studied the 
grammar of his native language! How much better some 
fables or historical narratives would answer his purpose ! 
But Condillac does not stop there. When his pupil has a 
systematic knowledge of the operations of the soul, when 
he has comprehended the genesis of ideas; in a word, when, 
towards the age of eight or ten, he is as proficient in philos- 
ophy as his master, and almost as capable of writing the 
Treatise on Sensations, what do you think he is invited to 
study? Something which very much resembles the philoso- 
phy of history : ~ 
‘After having, made him reflect on his own infancy, I 
thought that the infancy of the world would be the most 
interesting subject for him, and the easiest to study.” 
343. Tae Arr or Tuinxinc. — It is only when he judges 
that the mind of his pupil is sufficiently prepared by psycho- 
logical analysis and by general reflections on the progress 
of humanity, that Condillac decides to have him enter upon 
the ordinary course of study. Here the spirit of system dis-
-P-A-G-E-348
316 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
appears, and gives place to more judicious-and more practi- 
cal ideas. Thus Condillac thinks that “the study of gram- 
mar would be more wearisome than usefal if i$ come too 
early.” Would that he had applied this principle to psy chol- 
ogy! Before studying grammar, then, Condillac’s pupil reads 
the poets,— the French poets, of course,-~and preferably 
the dramatic authors, Racine especially, whom he reads for 
the twelfth time. The real knowledge of the language pre- 
eedes the abstract study of the rules. Condillac himself 
composed a grammar entitled the Art’ of Speaking. In this 
he imitates the authors of Port Royal, “‘ who,” he says, 
‘¢were the first to write elementary books on an intelligent 
plan.” After the Art of Speaking he calls the attention of 
his pupil to three other treatises in succession, — the Art of 
Writing, or rhetoric, the Art of Reasoning, or logic, and the 
Art of Thinking. We shall not attempt an analysis of these 
works, which have gone out of date, notwithstanding the 
value of certain portions of them. The general characteris- 
tic of these treatises on intellectual education is that the 
author is pre-occupied with the relations of ideas more than 
with the exterior elegancies of style, with the development of 
thought more than with the beauties of language : — 
“Especially must the intelligence be nourished, even as 
the body is nourished. We must present to it knowledge, 
which is the wholesome aliment of spirit, opinions and errors 
being aliment that is poisonous. It is also necessary that 
the intelligence be active, for the thought remains imbecile 
as long as, passive rather than active, it moves at random.” 
344. Ornex ‘Parts or THE Course or Sropy. — It 
seems that Condillac is in pursuit of but.one single purpose, 
—to make of his. pupil a thinking being, The study of 
Latin is postponed till the time when the intelligence, being 
completely formed, will find in the study of that language
-P-A-G-E-349
PHILOSOPHERS OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY. wt 
only the difficulty of learning words. Condillac has but 
little taste for the study of the ancient languages. He rele- 
gates the study of Latin to the second place, and omits 
Greek entirely. But he accords a great importance to his- 
torical studies. . 
‘“« After having learned to think, the Prince made the study 
of history his principal object for six years.” 
Twelve volumes of the Course of Study have transmitted 
to us Condillac’s. lessons in history. In this he does not take. 
delight, as Rollin does, in long narrations; but he analyzes, 
multiplies his reflections, and abridges facts; he philoso-. 
phizes more than he recites the facts of history. 
345. PersonaL Reriecrion. — What we have said of Con- 
dillae’s Course of Study suffices to justify the judgment 
expressed of his pedagogy by one of his disciples, Gérando, 
when he wrote: ‘‘He who had so thoroughly studied the 
manner. in which ideas are formed in the human mind, had 
but little skill in calling them into being in the intelligence 
of his pupil.” 
But we would judge our author unjustly if, after the criti- 
cisms we have made of him, we were not to accord him the 
praise he deserves, especially for having comprehended, as he 
has done, the value of personal reflection, and the superiority: 
of judgment over memory. A few quotations will rehabilitate 
the pedagogy of Condillac in the minds of our readers. 
Above all else there must be an exercise in personal 
reflection : — 
““T grant that the education which cultivates only the 
memory may make prodigies, and that it has done so; but. 
these prodigies last only during the time: of infancy. .. . 
He who knows only by heart, knows nothing. . . . He who 
has not learned to reflect has not been instructed, or, what is- 
still worse, has been poorly instructed.”
-P-A-G-E-350
818 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
“True knowledge is in the reflection, which has acquired 
it, much more than in the memory, which holds it in keep- 
ing; and the things which we are capable of recovering are 
better known than those of which we have a recollection. 
It does not suffice, then, to give a child knowledge. It is 
necessary that he instruct himself by seeking knowledge on 
his own account, and the essential point is to guide him 
properly. If he is Jed in an orderly way, he will acquire 
exact ideas, and will seize their succession and relation. 
Then, able to call them up for review, he will be able to 
compare them with others that are more remote, and to 
make a final choice of those which he wishes to study. 
Reflection can always recover the things it has known, 
because it knows how it originally found them; but the 
memory does not so recover the things it has learned, 
because it does not know how it learns.” 
This is why Condillac places far above the education w= 
receive, the education that we give ourselves : — 
‘*Henceforth, Sir, it remains for you alone to instruct 
yourself. Perhaps you imagine you have finished; but it is L 
who have finished. You are to begin anew!” 
346. Excesstve Dzvorion Crrtictsep.—- What beautiful 
lessons Condillac also addresses to his pupil to induce him to 
enfranchise himself from ecclesiastical tutelage! Written 
by an abbot, the eloquent page we are about to read proves 
how the lay spirit tended to pronounce itself in the eighteenth 
century. 
‘¢ You cannot be too pious, Sir; but if your piety is not 
enlightened, you will so far forget, your duties as to be 
engrossed in the little things of devotion. Because prayer is 
necessary, you will think you ought always to be praying, 
not considering that true devotion consists first of all in 
fulfilling the duties of your station in life: it will not be your

PHILOSOPHERS OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY. 319 
fault that you do not live in your heart as in a cloister. 
Hypocrites will swarm around you, the monks will issue 
- from their cells. The priests will abandon the service of the 
altar in order to be edified with the sight of your holy 
works. Blind prince! you will not perceive how their con- 
duct is in contradiction with their language. You will not 
even observe that the men who praise you for always being 
at the foot of the altar, themselves forget that it is their own 
duty to be there. You will unconsciously take their place 
and leave to them your own. You will be continually at 
prayer, and you will believe that you assure your salvation. 
They will cease to pray, and you will believe that they 
assure their salvation. Strange contradiction, which turns 
aside ministers from the Church to give bad ministers to the 
State.” 4 
347. Dipexor (1713-1784).— To him who knows noth- 
ing of Diderot save his works of imagination, often so licen- 
tious, it will doubtless be a surprise to see the name of this 
fantastic writer inscribed in the catalogue of educators. 
But this astonishment will disappear if we will take the 
trouble to recollect with what versatility this mighty spirit 
could vary the subject of his reflections, and pass from the 
gay to the solemn, and especially with what ardor, in con- 
junction with D’Alembert, he was the principal founder of 
the Encyclopédie, and the indefatigable contributor to it. 
348. His Psepacocical Works. — But there is no room 
for doubt. Diderot has written at least two treatises that 
belong to the history of education: first; about 1773, The 
Systematic Refutation of the Book of Helvetius on Man, an 
incisive arid eloquent criticism of the paradoxes and errors” 
of Helvetius ; and, in the second place, about 1776, a com-

820 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY: 
plete seheme of education, composed at the request of Cath- 
erine II., under the title, Plan of a University. L 
349. Hrs Marirs as an Epucaror. — Doubtless Diderot 
did not have sufficient gravity of character or sufficiently 
definite ideas to be a perfect educator; but, by way of com- 
pensation, the natural and acquired qualities of his mind 
made him worthy of the confidence placed in him by Cathe- 
rine II. in entrusting him with the organization, at least in 
theory, of the instruction of the Russian people. First of 
all, he had the merit of being a universal thinker, ‘‘ suffi- 
ciently versed in ail the sciences to know their value, and 
not sufficiently profound in any one to give it a preference 
inspired by predilection.” Engaged in the scientific move- 
ment, of which the Encyclopédie was the centre, he at the 
same time cherished an enthusiastic passion for letters. He 
worshipped Shakespeare and modern poetry, but he was not 
less enamored of classical antiquity, and for several years, 
he says, ‘‘he thought it as much a religious duty to read a 
song of Homer as a good priest would to recite his breviary.”” 
850. Necxssiry or Instruction. — Diderot, and this is 
to his praise, is distinguished from the most of his contem- 
poraries, and especially from Rousseau, by his ardent faith 
in the moral efficacy of instruction : — 
‘‘Far from corrupting,” he exclaims, ‘instruction sweet- 
ens character, throws light on duty, makes vice less gross, 
and either chokes it or conceals it. .. . Idare assert that 
purity of morals has followed the progress of dress, from the 
skin of animals to fabrics of silk.” 
Hence he decides on the necessity of instruction for all : 
‘* From the prime minister to the lowest peasant, it is good 
for every one to know how to read, write, and count.”

-P-A-G-E-353
PHILOSOPHERS OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY. $21 
And he proposes to all people the example of Germany, 
with her strongly organized system of primary instruction? 
He demands schools open to all children, ‘‘ schools of read- 
ing, writing, arithmetic, and religion,’ in which- will be 
studied both a moral and a political catechism. Attend- 
ance on these schools shall be obligatory, and to make com- 
pulsion possible, Diderot demands gratuity. He goes even 
farther, and would have the child fed at school, and with his 
books would have him find bread. 
351. Tue Conception or Pusuic Insrrucrion. — Like all 
who sincerely desire a strong organization of instruction, 
Diderot assigns the direction of it to the State. His ideal of 
a Russian university bears a strong resemblance to the French 
University of 1808. He would have at its head a politician, 
a statesman, to whom should be submitted all the affairs of 
public instruction. He even went so far as to entrust to 
this general master of the university the duty of presiding 
over the examinations, of appointing the presidents of col- 
leges, of excluding bad pupils, and of deposing. professors 
and tutors. 
352. Crrmictsm or Frencn Coiteces. — Secondary instrue- 
tion, what was then called the Faculty of Arts, is the princi- 
pal object of Diderot’s reflections. He criticises the traditional 
system with extreme severity, and his charge, thought some- 
times unjust, deserves to be quoted :— 
“Tt is in the Faculty of Arts that there aré still taught 
to-day, under the name of belles-lettres, two dead languages 
which are of use only to a small number of citizens; it is 
there that they are studied for six or seven years without 
being learned; under the name of rhetoric, the art of speak- 
ing is taught before the art of thinking, and that of speaking 
elegantly before having ideas; under the name of logic, the © 
head is filled with the subtilties of Aristotle, and of his very

822 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
sublime and very useless theory of the syllogism, and there 
is spread over a hundred obscure pages what might have been 
clearly stated in four; under the name of ethics, I do not 
know what is said, but I know that there is not a word said 
either of the qualities of mind or heart; under the name of 
metaphysics, there are discussed theses as trifling as they are 
knotty, the first elements of scepticism and bigotry, and the 
germ of the unfortunate gift of replying to everything ; under 
the name of physics, there is endless dispute about the ele- 
ments of matter and the system of the world; but not a word 
on natural history, not a word on real chemistry, very little 
on the movement and fall of bodies; very few experiments, 
less still of anatomy, and nothing of geography.” ? 
353. Proposep Rerorms. — After such a spirited criticism, 
it was Diderot’s duty to propose earnest and radical reforms ; 
but all of those which he suggests are not equally com- 
mendable. 
Let us first note the idea revived in our day by Auguste 
Comte and the school of positivists, of a connection and a 
subordination of the sciences, classified in a certain order, 
according as they presuppose the science which has preceded, 
or as they facilitate the study of the science which follows, 
and also according to the measure of their utility.” It is 
according to this last principle in particular, that Diderot 
distributes the work of the school, after having called atten- 
tion to the fact that the order of the sciences, as determined 
by the needs of the school, is not their logical order :— 
‘The natural connection of one science with the others 
designates for it a place, and the principle of utility, more 
or less general, determines for it another place.” 
  
1 Quvres, Tome Il. p. 459.

of Universal Progress, Chap. IIL. (P.) .
-P-A-G-E-355
PHILOSOPHERS OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY. 323 
But Diderot forgets that we must take into account, not 
alone the principle of utility in the distribution of studies, 
but that the essential thing of all others is to adapt the order 
of studies to the progress of the child in age and aptitudes. 
354, PREFERENCES FOR THE ScteNnces. — Although equally 
enamored of letters and the sciences, Diderot did not know 
how to hold a just balance between a literary and a scientific 
education. Anticipating Condorcet and Auguste Comte, he 
displaces the centre of instruction, and gives a preponderance 
to the sciences. Of the eight classes comprised in his 
Faculty of Arts, the first five are devoted to the mathematics, 
to mechanics, to astronomy, to physics, and to chemistry. 
Grammar and the ancient languages are relegated to the last 
three years, which nearly correspond to what are called in 
our colleges the ‘* second ” and ‘‘ rhetoric.” 
The charge that must be brought against Diderot in this 
place, is not merely that he puts an unreasonable restriction 
on literary studies, but also that he makes a bad distribution 
of scientific studies in placing the mathematics before physics. 
It is useless for him to assert that ‘‘it is easier to learn 
geometry than to learn to read.” He does not convince us 
of this. It is a grave error to begin by keeping the child’s 
attention on numerical abstractions, by leaving his senses 
unemployed, by postponing so long. the study of natural 
history and experimental physics, those sciences expressly 
adapted to children, because, as Diderot himself expresses 
it, ‘+ they involve a continuous exercise of sight, smell, taste, 
and memory.” 
To excuse Diderot’s error, it does not suffice to state that 
his pupil does not enter the Facultv of Arts till his twelfth 
year. Till that period, he will learn only reading, writing, 
  1 See note, p. 131.

824 - THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
and orthography. There is ground for thinking that these 
first years will be rather poorly employed; but besides this, 
it is evident that even at the age of twelve the mind is not 
sufficiently mature to be plunged into the cold deductions of 
mathematics. 
355. IncompLeTE Views as To THE Scope oF LireRArr 
Srupies. — Diderot’s attitude with respect to classical studies 
is a matter of surprise. On the one hand, he postpones their 
study till the pupil’s nineteenth and twentieth year. On the 
other, with what enthusiasm this eloquent scholar speaks of 
" the ancients, particularly of Homer! 
‘«Homer is the master to whom I am indebted for what- 
ever merit I have, if indeed I have any at all.’ It is difficult 
to attain to excellence in taste without a knowledge of the 
Greek and Latin languages. I early dréw my intellectual 
nourishment from Homer, Virgil, Horace, Terence, Anacreon, 
Plato, and Euripides on the one hand, and from Moses and 
the Prophets on the other.” 
How are we to explain this contradiction of an incon- 
sistent and ungrateful humanist who extols the humanities 
to the skies, and at the same time puts such restrictions on 
the ¢eaching of them as almost to annihilate them? ‘The 
reason for this is, that,in his opinion, the belles-lettres are 
useful only for the training of orators and poets, but are not 
serviceable in the general development of the mind. Conse- 
quently, being fancy studies, so to speak, they are fit only 
for a small minority of pupils, and have no right to the first 
place in a common education, destined for men in general. 
Diderot is not able to discern what, in pedagogy, is their 
true title to nobility, — that they are an admirable instru- 
ment of intellectual gymnastics, and the surest and-also the 
most convenient means of acquiring those qualities of just-

ness, of precision, and of clearness, which are needed by all 
conditions of men, and are applicable to all the special em- 
ployments of life? 
856. Oprnton or MarmonteL. — Diderot seems to reduce 
the office of letters to a study of words, and to an exercise of 
memory. He might have learned a lesson from one of his 
contemporaries, Marmontel, whose intellect, though less bril- 
liant, was sometimes more just, an advantage which the 
intelligence gains from early discipline in the study of the 
languages : — . 
‘The choice and use of words, in translating from one 
language to another, and even then some degree of elegance 
in the construction of sentences, began to interest me; and 
this work, which did not proceed without the analysis of ideas, 
fortified my memory. I perceived that it was the idea attached 
to the word which made it take root, and reflection soon made 
me feel that the study of the languages was also the study of 
the art of.distinguishing shades of thought, of decomposing it, 
of forming its texture, and of catching with precision its © 
spirit and its relations; and that along with words, an equal 
number of new ideas were introduced and developed in the 
1 This thought will bear extension as in the following quotation: ‘‘ The 
reasoning that I oppose starts from the low and false assumption that in- 
struction serves only forthe practical use that is made of it; for example, 
that he who, by his social position, does not make use of his intellectual 
culture, has no need of that culture. Literature, from this point of view, 
is useful only to the man of letters, science only to the scientist, good man-~ 
ners and fine bearing cnly to men of the world. The poor man should be 
ignorant, fer edueation and knowledge are useless to him. Blasphemy, 
Gentlemen! The culture of the mind and the culture of the soul are duties 
for everyman. They are not simple ornaments; they are things as sacred 
ag religion” (Renan, Famille et Etat, p.3). This is a sufficient answer 
to Mr. Spencer’s assumption (Education, p. 84), that the studies that are 
best for guidance are at the same time the best for discipline. See also 
Dugald Stewart (Zlemenis, p.12). (P.)

heads of the young,’ and that in this way the early classes 
were a course in elementary philosophy, much more rich, 
more extended, and of greater real utility than we think, 
when we complain that in our colleges nothing is learned but 
Latin.” ? 
357. Oruer Noverries in Diveror’s Pian. — Without 
entering into the details of the very elaborate organization 
of Diderot’s Russian University, we shall call attention to 
some other novelties of his system : — 
1. The division of the classes into several series of paral- 
lel courses: first, the series of scientific and literary courses ; 
then, the series of lectures devoted to religion, to ethics, and 
to history; and finally, courses in drawing, music, ete. 
2.. The whimsical idea of teaching history in an inverted 
order, so to speak, in beginning with the most recent events, 
and little by little going back to antiquity. 
3. His extreme estimate of the art of reading: ‘‘ Let a 
teacher of reading be associated with a professor of drawing ; 
  
1 This thought throws light on a dictum of current pedagogy, ‘ First, 
the idea, then the term.”’ It shows that very often, in actual experience, 
the sequence is from term to idea. The relation between term and idea is 
the same in kind as that between sentence and thought. Must wethen say, 
“First the thought, then the sentence’’? Or, ‘‘ First the thought, then the 
chapter or the back’’? 
The disciplinary value of translation is also well stated. It may be 
doubted whether the schools furnish a better ‘‘intellectual gymnastic.’’ 
Three high intellectual attainments are involved in 4 réal translation: 1. 
The separation of the thought from the original form of words; 2. The 
seizing or comprehension of the thought as a mental possession; and 3. The 
embodying of the thought in a new form. A strictly analogous process, of 
almost equal value in its place, is that variety of reading in which the 
pupil is required to express the thought of the paragraph in his own lan- 
mage. This exercise involves the three processes above stated, and may 
be called “ the translation of thought from one form into another, in the 
same language.” (P.)

there are so few men, even the most enlightened, who snow 
how to read‘well, a gift always so agreeable, and often so 
necessary.” 
4. A special regard for the study of art and for esthetic 
education, which could not be a matter of indifference to the . 
great art critic who wrote the Salons. : 
5. A reform in the system of ushers.1 Diderot would 
have for supervising assistants in colleges, educated men, 
eapable on occasion of supplying the places of the profes- 
sors themselves. To attach them to their duties, he requires 
that some dignity be given to their modest, and useful func- 
tions, and that the usher be a sort of supernumerary, or 
“ professor in reversion,” who aspires to the chair of the pro- 
fessor, whose place he supplies from time to time, and which 
he may finally attain. 
. 858. Hetvetius (1715-1771). — In undertaking the study 
of the thoughts of Helvetius on education, and the .rapid 
analysis of his Treatise on Man, we shall not take leave of 
Diderot, for the work of Helvetius has had the good or the 
bad fortune of being commented on and criticised by his 
illustrious contemporary. Thanks to the Systematic Refuta- 
tion of the Book of Helvetius on Man, which forms a charming 
accompaniment of pungent or vigorous reflections to a dull 
and languid book, the reading of the monotonous treatise of 
Helvetius becomes easy and almost agreeable. 
359. Tae Treatise on Man. —Under this title, a little 
long, De ?homme, de ses facultés intellectuelles et de son édu- 
eation, Helvetius has composed a large work which he had in | 
contemplation for fifteen years, and which did not appear 
till after his death, in 1772. As a matter of fact, education 
does not directly occupy the author’s attention except in the 
  1 Miitre d’étude : ‘We who in a lycée, college, or boarding-schooi, hag 
aversight of pupils during study hours and recreations.” — Larrré.

first. and the last chapters (sections. I. and X.). With this 
exception, the whole book is devoted to long developments 
of the favorite maxims of his philosophy: as the intel- 
lectual equality of all men, and the reduction of all the pas- 
sions to the pursuit of pleasure; or to platitudes, such ag 
the influence of laws on the happiness of people, and the evils 
which result from ignorance. 
860. Porency or Epucation. — When he does not fall 
into platitudes, Helvetius goes off into paradoxes that are 
presumptuous and systematic. His habitual characteristic 
is pedantry in what is false. According to him, for example, 
education is all-powerful; it is the sole cause of the differ- 
ence between minds. The mind of the child is but an empty 
capacity, something indeterminate, without predisposition. 
The impressions of the senses are the only elements of the 
intelligence ; so that the acquisitions of the five senses are 
the only thing that is of moment; ‘the senses are all that 
there is of man.” It is not possible to push sensationalism 
further than this. ‘ 
The impressions of the senses are, then, the basis of 
human nature, and as these impressions vary with circum- 
stances, Helvetius arrives at this conclusion, that chance is 
the great master in the formation of mind and character. 
Consequently, he undertakes to produce at will men of 
genius, or, at least, men of talent. For this purpose, it 
suffices to ascertain, by repeated observations, the means 
which chance employs for making great men. ‘These means 
once discovered, it remains only to set them at work arti- 
' ficially and to combine them, in order to produce the same 
effects. : 
“ Genius is a product of chance. Rousseau, like a count- 
less number of illustrious men, may be regarded as one of 
‘the masterpieces of chance.”
-P-A-G-E-361
PHILOSOPHERS OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY. “829 
, $61, Hetverros rercrep sy Diperor.—It is easy: to 
reply to extravagant statements of this sort. Had Helve- 
tius consulted teachers and parents, had he observed himself, 
had he simply reflected on his two daughters, so unequally 
endowed though identically educated, he would doubtless 
have felt constrained to acknowledge the limitations of 
education ; he would have comprehended that it cannot give 
imagination to minds of sluggish temperament, nor enthusi- 
asm and sensibility to inert souls, and that the most marvel- 
lously helpful circumstances will not make of a Helvetius a 
- Montesquieu or a Voltaire. 
But if it is easy to refute Helvetius, it is impossible to 
criticise him with more brilliancy and eloquence than Diderot 
has done. With what perfection of reason he restores to 
nature, to innate and irresistible inclinations, the influence 
which Helvetius denies to them in the formation of char- 
acter ! 
‘*The accidents of Helvetius,” he says, ‘‘are like the 
spark which sets on fire a cask of wine, and which is extin- 
guished in a bucket of water.” . 
‘¢ For thousands of centuries the dew of heaven has fallen 
on the rocks without making them fertile. The sown fields 
await it in order to become productive, but it is not the dew 
that scatters the seed. Aecidents themselves no more pro- 
duce anything, than the pick of the laborer who delves 
in the mines of Golconda produces the diamond that it 
brings to the surface.” 
Donbtiess education has a more radical effect than that 
which is attributed to it by La Bruyére when he said that 
“it touches only the surface of the soul.” But if it can do 
much, it cannot do all. It perfects if it ig good; it deadens 
and it perverts if itis bad; but it can never be a substitute 
for lacking aptitude, and can never replace nature.
-P-A-G-E-362
230 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
362. SecuLarizep Instrucrion. — In other parts of his 
system Helvetius is in accord with Diderot. Like him, he 
believes the necessary condition of progress in education is 
that it be made secular and entrusted to the civil power. 
The vices of education come from the opposition of the two 
powers, spiritual and temporal, that assume to direct it. 
Betweer the Church and the State there is an opposition of 
interests and views. The State would have the nation 
become brave, industrious, and enlightened. The Church 
demands a blind submission and unlimited credulity. Hence 
there is contradiction in pedagogical precepts, diversity in 
the means that are employed, and, consequently, an educa- 
tion that is hesitating, that is. pulled in opposite directions, 
that does not know definitely where it is going, that misses 
its way, that gropes and wastes time. 
But the conclusion of Helvetius is not as we might expect, 
—the separation of Church and State in the matter of 
instruction and education, such as recent laws have estab- 
lished in France. No; Helvetius would have the State 
absorb the Church, and have religious power and civil 
power lodged in the same hands and both belong to those 
who control the government, —a vexatious confusion that 
would end in the oppression of consciences. 
Helvetius, whatever may be thought. of him, does not 
deserve to claim our attention for any length of time, and we 
cannot seriously consider as an authority in pedagogy a writer 
who, in intellectual as in moral education, reduces everything 
to a single principle, the development and the satisfaction of 
physical sensibility. 
  - 2 Itis a matter of surprise that in a German Pedagogical Library the very 
first French work published is the Traité de?’ Homme of Helvetius. This 
is giving the place of honor to what is perhaps of the most ordinary value 
in French pedagogical literature.

PHILOSOPHERS OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY. 3831 
363. Tue Encycrorzpists. — The vast collection which, 
‘under the name Encyclopédie, sums up the science and the 
philosophy of the eighteenth century, touches educational 
questions only in passing. Properly speaking, the Encyclo- 
pédie contains no system of pedagogy. The principal frag- 
ment is the article Hducation, written by the grammarian 
and Latinist Dumarsais. 
But this piece of work is little worthy of its author, and 
little worthy in particular of the Encyclopédie. It contains 
scarcely anything but vague and trite generalities, and 
belongs to the category of those articles for padding which 
caused Voltaire to say: ‘‘You accept articles worthy of the 
Journal of Trévoux.” We shall notice, however, in this 
article, the importance accorded to the study of physics, and 
to the practice of the arts, even the most common, and the 
marked purpose, to “‘ subordinate ”’ knowledges and studies, 
or to distribute them in a logical, or rather psychological, 
order; for example, to cause the concrete always to precede 
the abstract. But, after having lost himself in considera- 
tions of but little interest on the development of ideas and 
sentiments in the human soul, the author, who is decidedly 
far below his task, concludes by recommending to young 
people “ the reading of newspapers.” 
The other pedagogical articles of the Hnreyclopédie are 
equally deficient in striking novelties, If the great work of 
D’Alembert and Diderot has contributed something to the 
progress of education, it is less through the insufficient 
efforts which if has directly attempted in this direction, than 
through the general influence which it has exercised on the 
French mind in extolling the sciences in their theoretical 
study as well as in their practical applications, in diffusing 
technical knowledge, in glorifying the industrial aris, and in 
thus preparing for the coming of a scientific and positive

education in place of an education exclusively literary ‘and of 
pure form, . 
364. Kanr (1724-1804).—- We know the considerable 
influence which, for a century, Kant has exercised on the 
development of philosophy. Since Descartes, no thinker had 
to the same degree excited an interest in the great. problems 
of philosophy, nor more vigorously obliged the human reason 
to render an account of itself. It is then a piece of good 
fortune for the science of education that a philosopher of this 
order has taken up the discussion of pedagogical questions, 
and has thrown upon them the light of his penetrating criti- 
cism. The admiration which he felt for Rousseau, his atten- 
tive and impassioned reading of the Emile, his own reflec- 
tions on the monastic education which he had received at the 
Collegium Fredericianum, a sort of small seminary conducted 
by the Pietists, the experience which he had had as a precep- 
tor in several families that entrusted him with their children, 
and finally, above all else, his profound studies on human 
nature and his exalted moral philosophy, had given him a 
capital preparation for treating educational questions. Pro- 
fessor at the University of Kénigsberg, he several times 
resumes the discussion of pedagogical subjects with a marked 
predilection for them, and the notes of his lectures, collected 
by one of his colleagues, formed the little Treatise on Peda- 
gogy which we are about to analyze.? 
_ 865. Hicu Concertion or Epucation. —In the opinion 
of Kant, the art of educating men, with that: of governing 
them, is the most difficult and the most important of all. It 
is by education alone that humanity can be perfected and 
regenerated : —   
1 See the French translation of this tract at the end of the volume, pub- 
lished by Monsieur Barni, under the title, Zlements métaphysiques de la 
doctrine dela vertu. Paris, 1855. The work of Kant appeared in German 
in 1803,
-P-A-G-E-365
PHILOSOPHERS OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY. 333 
‘Tt is pleasant to think that human nature will always be 
better and better developed by education, and that at last 
there will thus be given it the form which best befits it. 
“*To know how far the omnipotence of education can go, 
it would be necessary that a being of a superior order should 
undertake the bringing up of men.” 
But in order that it may attain this exalted end, education 
must be set free from routine and traditional methods. It 
must bring up children, not in view of their success in the 
present state of human society, but ‘‘ in view of a better state, . 
possible in the future, and according to an ideal conception 
of humanity and of its complete destination.” 
366. Psycnotocica Optimism. — Kant comes near 
accepting the opinion of Rousseau on the original innocence 
of man and the perfect goodness of his natural: inclina- 
tions : — / : 
“It is said in medicine that the physician is but the ser- 
vant of nature. This is true of the moralist. Ward off the 
bad influences from without, and nature can be trusted to 
find for herself the best way.’?? 
Thus Kant does not tire of exalting the service which 
Rousseau had rendered pedagogy, in recalling educators to 
the confidence and respect that are due to calumniated human 
nature. Let us add, however, that the German philosopher 
is not content to repeat Rousseau. He corrects him in 
affirming that man, at his birth, is neither good nor evil, 
because he is not naturally a moral being. He does not be- 
come such till he raises his reason to the conception of duty 
and law. In other terms, in the infant everything is in germ. 
The infant is a being in preparation. The future alone, the 
development which he will receive from his education, will 
make him good or bad. At the beginning, he has but inde+

B34 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY... 
terminate dispositions, and evil will come, not.from a definite 
inclination of nature, but solely from the fact that we will 
not have known how to direct it, — from the fact, according 
to Kant’s own expression, that we will not. have ‘subjected 
nature to rules.” . 
867. Respecr FoR THE LipEeRty of THE CuILp. — The 
psychological optimism of Kant inspires him, as it does 
Rousseau, with the idea of a negative education, respectful 
of the liberty of the child: -—.. 
‘In general, it must be noted that the earliest education 
should be negative ; that is to say, nothing should be added 
to the precautions taken by nature, and that the effort should 
be limited to the preservation of her work... . It is well to 
employ at first but few helps, and to leave children to learn 
for themselves. Much of the weakness of man is due, not 
to the fact that’ nothing is taught him, but to the fact that 
false impressions are communicated to him.” 
Without going so far as to say with Rousseau that all 
dependence with respect to men is contrary to order, Kant 
took great care to respect the liberty of the pupil. He com- 
plains of parents who are always talking about ‘‘ breaking 
the wills of their sons.” He maintains, not without reason, 
that it is not necessary to offer much resistance to children, 
if we have not begun by yielding too readily to their caprices, 
and by always responding to their cries. Nothing -is more | 
harmful to them than a discipline which is provoking and 
degrading. But, in his zeal for human liberty, the theorist 
of the autonomy of wills goes a little too far. He fears, fot 
example, the tyranny of habits. He requires that they be 
prevented from being formed, and that children be accus 
tomed to nothing. He might as well demand the suppressiot 
of all education, since education should be but the acquisitiot 
af a body of good habits.
-P-A-G-E-367
PHILOSOPHERS OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY. 335 
368. Srorms Inrerpicrep. —In the education of the in- 
tellectual faculties or talents, which he calls.the physical cul- 
ture of the soul, as distinguished from moral.culture, which 
is the education of the will, Kant also approaches Rousseau. 
He proscribes romances and stories. ‘‘ Children have an ex- 
tremely active imagination which has no need of being devel- 
oped by stories.” It may be said in reply, that fables and 
fictions, at the same time that they develop the imagination, 
also direct it and adorn it with their own proper grace, and 
may even lend it moral support. Rousseau, notwithstanding 
the ardor of his criticisms on the Fables of La Fontaine, him- 
self admitted the moral value of the apologue. 
869. Currore or THE Facurtres. — That which distin- 
guishes Kant as an educator is that he is pre-occupied with 
the culture of the faculties much more than with the acquisi- 
tion of knowledge. He passes in review the different intel- 
lectual forces, and his reflections on each of them might be 
collected as the elements of an excellent system of educational 
psychology. He will criticise, for example, the abuse of. 
memory : — ‘ 
‘* Men who have nothing but memory,” he says, ‘‘ are but 
living lexicons, and, as it were, the pack-horses of Parnassus.” 
For the culture of the understanding, Kant proposes “at 
first to train it passively to some degree,” by requiring of the 
child examples which illustrate a rule, or, on the contrary, 
the rule-which applies to particular examples. 
For the exercise of the reason, he recommends the Socratio 
method, and, in general, for the development of all the fac- 
ulties of the mind, he thinks that the best way of proceeding 
is to cause the pupil to be active: — . 
“The best way to comprehend is todo. What we learn 
the most thoroughly is what we learn to some extent by 
ourselves.”
-P-A-G-E-368
1 
836 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
370. Dirrerent Kinps or Pounisnuents. — Kant has made 
a subtile analysis of the different qualities with which punish- 
ment may be invested. He distinguishes from physical 
punishment, moral punishment, which is the better. It con- 
‘sists in humiliating the pupil, in greeting him coolly, ‘‘ in 
encouraging the disposition of the child to be honored and 
loved, that auxiliary of morality.” Physical punishments 
ought to-be employed with precaution, “to the end that they 
may not entail servile dispositions.” 
Another distinction is that of natural punishments and 
artificial punishments. The first are preferable to the second, 
because they are the very consequences of the faults which 
have been committed ; ‘indigestion, for example, which a 
child brings on himself when he eats too much.” Another 
advantage of natural punishment, Kant justly remarks, ‘is 
that man submits to it all his life.’?? 
Finally, Kant divides punishments into negative and posi- 
tive. The first are to be used for minor faults, and the 
others are to be reserved for the punishment of conduct that 
is absolutely bad. 
Moreover, whatever punishment may be applied, Kant 
advises the teacher to avoid the appearance of feeling malice 
towards the pupil : — 
‘‘The punishments we inflict while exhibiting signs of 
anger have a wrong tendency.” 
871. Rexicious Epucation. — At first view, we might 
be tempted to think that Kant has adopted the conclusions 
of Rousseau, and that, like him, he refuses to take an early 
  
1 Monsieur Compayré seems to give his sanction to the “ Discipline of 
Consequences.” 1 think that Mr. Fitch has correctly stated its limitations 
(Leeturés, p. 117). Kant doubtless borrowed the idea from Rousseau, who 
employs itin the government of his imaginary pupil. (See Miss Worthing- 
ton’s translation of the mile, p. 66.) This doctrine is the basis of Mr. 
Spencer’s chapter on Moral Education. (P.)
-P-A-G-E-369
PHILOSOPHERS OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY. 387 
occasion to inculcate in the child’s mind the notion of a 
Supreme Being :— . 
* Religious ideas always suppose some system of. theology. 
Now, how are we to teach theology to the young, who, far 
from knowing the world, do not yet know themselves? How 
shall the young who do not yet know what duty is, be in a 
condition to comprehend an immediate duty towards God?” 
To speak of religion to a young man, it would then be logical 
to wait till he is in a condition to form a clear and fixed con- 
ception of the nature of God. But it is impossible to do | 
this, says Kant, because the young man lives in a society 
where he hears the name of the Divinity spoken at each 
moment, and where he takes part in continual observances 
of piety. It is better, then, to teach him at an early hour 
true religious notions, for fear that he may borrow from 
other men notions that are superstitious and false. In 
reality, Kant dissents from Rousseau only because, re-estab- 
lishing the conditions of real life, he restores Emile to society, 
no longer keeping him in a fancied state of isolation. Whata 
broad and noble way, moreover, of conceiving religious edu- 
cation!’ The best way of making clear to the mind of 
children the idea of God, is, according to Kant, to seek ‘an 
analogy in the idea of a human father. It is necessary, 
moreover, that the conception of duty precede the conception 
of God; that morality precede, and that theology follow. - 
Without morality, religion is but superstition; without 
morality, the pretended religious man is but a courtier, a 
suitor for divine favor. 
372. Morar Carecuism.— Those who know to what a 
height Kant could raise the theory of morality, will not be 
surprised at the importance which he ascribes to the teaching 
of morals, 
“Our schools,” he says, ‘‘ are almost entircly lacking in

388 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
one thing which, however, would be very useful for training 
children in probity, — I mean a catechism on duty. It should 
contain, in a popular form, cases concerning the conduct to 
be observed in ordinary life, and which would always naturally 
raise this question: Is this right or not?” 
. He had begun to write a book of this kind under the title 
Moral Catechism ;+ and he would have desired that an hour 
a day of school time be given to its study, ‘“‘in order to 
teach pupils to. know and to learn by heart their duty to men, 
_—that power of God on the earth.” The child, he says 
again, would there learn to substitute the fear of his own 
conscience for that of men and divine punishment, inward 
dignity for the opinion of others, the intrinsic value of 
actions for the apparent value of words, and, finally, a serene 
and cheerful piety for a sad and gloomy devotion. 
[373. Anatytica, Summary. —1. This study exhibits the 
influence of philosophical systems on education. New con- 
ceptions of human destiny, new theories with respect to the 
composition of human nature, or a new hypothesis concerning 
man’s place in nature, determine corresponding changes in 
educational theory. 
2. Perhaps the broadest generalization yet reached in 
educational theory is the assumption made by Condillac, 
that the education of each individual should be a repetition 
of civilization in petto. With Mr. Spencer this hypothesis 
becomes a law. 
3. In theory, the secularization of education has begun. 
The Church is to lose one of. its historical prerogatives, and 
the modern State is to become an educator.

4, Helvetius typifies what may be called the plastic theory 
in education, or the conception that the teacher, if wise 
enough, may ignore all differences in natural endowment. 
This makes man the victim of his environment. The truth 
evidently is that man is the only creature which can bend 
circumstances to his will; and he has such an endowment of 
power in this direction that he can virtually recreate his en- 
vironment and thus rise superior to it. And farther than 
this, there are innate differences in endowment that will per- 
sist in spite of all that education can do.

ciplinary value of translation.

knowledge, receives definite recognition from Kant.]

374. Jesuits aND PARLIAMENTARIANS. — Of the educators 
of the eighteenth century of whom we have been speaking 
up to the present time, no one has been called to exercise an 
immediate and direct action on the destinies of public edu- 
cation; no one of them had the power to apply the doctrines 
which were so dear to him to college education ; so that, so 
far, we have studied the theory and not the practice of edu- 
eation in the eighteenth century. ‘ 
On the contrary, the members of the French Parliaments, 
after having solicited and obtained from the king the expul- 
sion of the Jésuits, made memorable efforts, from 1762 up 
to the eve of the Revolution, to supply the places of the
-P-A-G-E-373

teachers whom they had driven away, to correct the faults 
of the ancient educatioa, and to give effect to the idea, 
cherished by the most of the great spirits of that time, of a 
national education adapted to the needs of civil society. 
They were the practical organizers of instruction; they pre- 
pared the foundation of the French University of the nine- 
teenth century; they resumed, not without lustre, the 
struggle too often interrupted, which the Jansenists had 
sustained against the Jesuits. 
875. EXPULSION OF THE JESUITS (1764).— The causes of 
the expulsion of the Jesuits were doubtless complex, and, 
above all else, political. In attacking the Company of Jesus, 
the Parliaments desired especially to defend the interests of 
the State, compromised by a powerful society which tended 
to dominate all Christian nations. But reasons of an edu- 
cational character had also some influence on the condemna- 
tion pronounced against the Jesuits by all the Parliaments of 
France. . From all quarters, in the reports which were drawn 
up by the municipal or royal officers of all the cities where 
the Jesuits had colleges, complaint is made of the scholastic 
methods and usages of the Company. Reforms were de- 
manded which they were incapable of realizing. 
And it is not in France alone that the faults in the educa- 
tion of the Jesuits were vigorously announced. In the edict 
of 1759, by which the king of Portugal expelled the Jesuits 
from his kingdom, it was said: ‘‘' The study of the human- 
ities has declined in the kingdom, and the Jesuits are evi- 
dently the cause of the decadence into which the Greek. and 
Latin tongues have fallen.” Some years later, in 1768, the 
king of Portugal congratulated himself on having banished 
‘‘the moral corruption, the superstition, the fanaticism, and 
the ignorance, which had been introduced by the Society of 
Jesus.”

376. Gexerat’ CoMPLAINTS aGAINnsT THE EDUCATION OF THE 
Jxzsurts. — Even in the middle of. the eighteenth century the 
Jesuits were still addicted to their.old routine, and even their 
faults were aggravated with the times. - . 
At Auxerre, complaint is ‘made that pupils study in their 
schools only 'a few Latin authors, and that they leave them 
without ever receiving into their hands :a single French 
author. 
At Moulins, a request is made that at ‘least one hour a 
week be devoted to the history of France, which proves that 
the Society of Jesus, always enslaved to its immobile formal- 
ism, did not grant even this little concession to the teaching 
of history. 
At Orleans, the necessity of teaching children the French 
language is insisted on. 
At Montbrison, the wish is expressed that pupils be taught 
a smattering of geography, especially of their own country. 
At Auxerre, it is proved that in the teaching of philos. 
ophy the time is employed ‘in copying and learning note 
books filled with vain distinctions and frivolous questions.” 
’ At Montbrison, the request is made ‘that the rules of 
reasoning be explained in French, and that there be a disuse 
of debates which train only disputants and not philosophers." 
It would be interesting to pursue this study, and to collec 
from these reports of 1762, — real memorials of a scholastit 
revolution, — all the complaints of public opinion against the 
Jesuits. Even in religion, the Company of Jesus is charge! 
with substituting for the sacred texts, books of devotion con 
posed by the Fathers. At Poitiers, 1 demand is made i

which was wholly neglected. , From time to time the Jesuit 
“were accused of continually mixing religious questions wit 
classical studies and of catechising at every tum. ‘* ‘TI

masters of the fifth and sixth forms in the College of 
Auxerre dogmatize in the themes which they dictate to the 
children.” Finally, the Company of Jesus maintained in 
the schools the teaching of moral casuistry ; it encouraged 
bigotry and superstition ; it relaxed nothing from the sever- 
ity of its discipline, and provoked violent recriminations 
among some of its former pupils who had preserved a pain- 
ful recollection of corrections received in its colleges.? 
377. EFFORTS MADE TO DISPLACE THE JEsuITs. —The Par- 
liaments, then, did nothing more, so to speak, than register 
the verdict of public opinion everywhere excited against the 
Jesuits. But while they heartily joined in the general rep- 
robation, they undertook to determine the laws of the new 
education. ‘It is of little use to destroy,” they said, ‘if . 
we do not intend to build. The public good and the honor 
of the nation require that we should establish a civil education 
which shall prepare each new generation for filling with suc- 
cess the different employments of the State.” Itis not just 
to’ say with Michel Bréal, that ‘‘once delivered from the 
Jesuits, the University installed itself in their establishments 
and continued their instruction.” Earnest attempts were 
made to reform programmes and methods. La Chalotais, 
Guyton de Morveau, Roiland, and still others attempted 
by their writings, and, when they could, by their acts, to 
establish a system of education which, while inspired by 
Rollin and the Jansenists, attempted to do still better. 
378. La Cmanorars (1701-1785). — Of all the parliamen- 
tarians who distinguished themselves in the campaign under- 
taken towards the middle of the eighteenth century against 
the pédagogy of the Jesuits, the most celebrated, and the

344 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. * 
most worthy of being such, is undoubtedly the solicitor. 
general of the Parliament of Bretagne, René de la Chalotais. 
A man of courage and character, he was arrested and im- 
prisoned in the citddel of Saint Malo for having upheld the 
franchise of the province of Bretagne; and it was in his 
prison, in 1765, that he drew up for his defence an eloquent 
and impassioned memorial, of which Voltaire said, ‘* Woe 
to every sensitive soul that does not feel the quivering of a 
fever in reading it!” 
379. His Essay on Narionan Epucation. — The E'ssat of 
La Chalotais appeared in 1763, one year after the Emile. 
Coming after the ambitious theories of a philosopher who, 
scorning polemics and the dissensions of his time, had 
written only for humanity and the future, this was a modest 
and opportune work, the effort of a practical man who 
attempted to respond to the aspirations and the needs of his 
time. Translated into several languages, the Hssai d’éduca- 
tion nationale obtained the enthusiastic approval of Diderot, 
and also of Voltaire, who said, ‘‘ It is a terrible book against 
the Jesuits, all the more so because it is written with moder- 
ation.” Grimm carried his admiration so far as to write, ‘* It 
would be difficult to present in a hundred and fifty pages 
more reflections that are wise, profound, useful, and truly 
worthy of a magistrate, of a philosopher, of a statesman.” 
Too completely forgotten to-day, this little composition of 
La Chalotais deserves to be republished. Notwithstanding 
some prejudices that mar it, it is already wholly. penetrated 
with the spirit of the Revolution. 
880. SrcunarizaTIoN or Epvcation. —As a matter of 
fact, the whole pedagogy of the eighteenth century is domi- 
nated by the idea of the necessary secularization of instruc- 
tion. Thorough-going Gallicans like La Chalotais or Rolland, 
dauntless free-thinkers like Diderot or Helvetius, all believe
-P-A-G-E-377
ORIGIN OF LAY AND NATIONAL INSTRUCTION. 346 
and assert that public instruction is a civil affair, a * goverm- 
ment undertaking,” as Voltaire expressed it. All wish to 
substitute lay teachers for religious teachers, and.to open 
civil schools upon the ruins of monastic schools. . 
‘* Who will be persuaded,” says Rolland in his report of 
1708, ‘* that fathers who feel an emotion that an. ecclesiastic 
never should have known, will be less capable than he of 
educating children?” 
La Chalotais also demands these citizen teachers. ' He 
objects to those instructors who, from interest as .well::as 
from principle, give the preference in their affections to: the 
supernatural world over one’s native land. 
“JT do not presume to exclude ecclesiastics,” he said, 
“but I protest against the exclusion of laymen. I dare claim 
for the nation an education which depends. only on the State; 
because it belongs essentially to the State; bécause every 
State has an inalienable and indefeasible right to instruct its 
members ; because, finally, the children of the State ought to 
be educated by the members of the State.” This does not 
mean that La Chalotais is irreligious ; but he desires a national 
teligion which does not subordinate the interests of the. 
country to a foreign power. What he wants especially. is, 
that the Church, reserving to herself the teaching of divine 
truth, abandon to the State the teaching of morals, and the 
control of purely human studies. He is of the same opinion 
as his friend Duclos, who said : — 
‘It is certain that in the education which was: given at 
Sparta, the prime purpose was to train Spartans.: It.is thus 
that in every State the purpose should be to enkindle the 
spirit of citizenship; and, in our case, to train Frenchmen, 
and in order to make Frenchmen, to labor to make men of 
thera. yt .

346 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
881. Practicat Purpose or Insrruction. — The partic. 
ular charge brought by La Chalotais against the education of 
his time, against that of the University as well as against 
that of the Jesuits, is, that it does not prepare children for 
real life, for life in the State. ‘‘A stranger who should visit 
our colleges might conclude that in France we think only of 
peopling the seminaries, the cloisters, and the Latin col- 
onies.” How are we to imagine that the study of a dead 
‘language, and a monastic discipline, are the appointed means 
for training soldiers, magistrates, and heads of families ? 
“The greatest vice of education, and perhaps the mosi 
inevitable, while it shall be entrusted to persons who have 
renounced the world, is the absolute Jack of instruction on 
the moral and political virtues. Our education does not 
affect our habits, like that of the ancients. After having 
endured all the fatigues and irksomeness of the college, the 
young find themselves in the need of learning in what consist 
the duties common to allmen. They have learned: no prin- 
ciple for judging actions, evils, opinions, customs. They 
have everything to learn on matters that are so important. 
They are inspired with a devotion which is but an imitation 
of religion, and with practices which take the place of virtne, 
and are but the shadow of it.” 
382. Inrorrive anp Narurat Instruction. —A pupil of 
the sensational school, 2 disciple of Locke and of Condillac, 
La Chalotais is too much inclined to misconceive, in the 
development of the individual, the play of natural activitie 
and innate dispositions. But, by way of compensation, hi 
predilection for sensationalism leads him to excellent thought 
on. the necessity of beginning with sensible objects befor 
advancing to intellectual studies, and first of all to secure 3! 
education of the senses. 
‘<I wish nothing to be taught children except facts whid
-P-A-G-E-379
ORIGIN OF LAY AND NATIONAL INSTRUCTION. 347 
are attested by the eyes, at the age of seven as at the age of 
thirty. 
The principles for instructing children should be those 
by which nature herself instructs them. Nature is the best 
of teachers. 
‘« Every method which begins with abstract ideas is not 
made for children. 
‘« Let children see many objects; let there be a variety of 
such, and let them be shown under many aspects and on 
various occasions. The memory and the imagination of 
children cannot be overcharged with useful facts and ideas 
of which they can make use in the course of their lives.” 
Such are the principles according to which La Chalotais 
organizes his plan of studies. 
383. Tue New Sprrir m Epucation. — The purpose, 
then, is to replace that monastic and ultramontane education 
(this is the term employed by La Chalotais), and also that 
narrow education, and that repulsive and austere discipline, 
“which seems made only to abase the spirit”; that sterile 
and insipid teaching, ‘‘ the most usual effect of which is to 
make study hated for life”; those scholastic studies where 
young men ‘ contract the habit of disputing and caviling” ; 
and those ascetic regulations ‘‘ which set neatness and health 
at defiance.” The purpose is to initiate children into our 
most common and most ordinary affairs, into what forms 
the conduct of life and the basis of civil society. 
‘“‘Most young men know neither the world which they 
inbabit, the earth which nourishes them, the men who supply 
their needs, the animals which serve them, nor the workmen 
and citizens whom they employ. They have not even any 
desire for this kind of knowledge. No advantage is taken 
of their natural curiosity for the purpose of increasing it.
-P-A-G-E-380
348 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
They know how to admire neither the wonders of nature not 
the prodigies of the arts.” 
This is equivalent to saying that they should henceforth 
learn all that up to this time they had been permitted to be 
ignoraut of. 
384. Srtupres oF THE First Pertop. — Education, ac- 
cording to-La Chalotais, should be divided into two periods : 
the first from five to ten, the second from ten to seventeen. 
During the first period, we have to do with children who 
have no experience because they have seen nothing, who 
have no power of attention because they are incapable of any 
sustained effort, and no judgment because they have not yet 
any general ideas; but who, by way of compensation, have 
senses, memory, and some power of reflection. It is neces- 
sary, then, to make a careful choice of the subjects of study 
which shall be proposed to these tender intelligences ; and 
La Chalotais decides in favor of history, geography, natural 
history, physical and mathematical recreations. 
‘‘ The exercises proposed for the first period,” he says, 
‘are as follows: learning to read, write, and draw; dancing 
and music, which ought to enter into the education of persons 
above the commonalty ; historical narratives and the lives of 
illustrious men of every country, of every age, and of every 
profession; geography, mathematical and physical recrea- 
tions; the fables of La Fontaine, which, whatever may be 
said of them, ought not to be removed from the hands of 
children, but all of which they should be made to learn by 
heart; and besides this, walks, excursions, merriment, and 
recreations; I do not propose even the studies except as 
amusements.” 
885. Criricism or Necative Epucation. — La Chalotais 
is often right as against Rousseau. For example, he has 
abundantly refuted the utopia of a negative education in
-P-A-G-E-381
ORIGIN OF LAY AND NATIONAL INSTRUCTION, 349. 
which nature is allowed to have her way, and which consid- 
ers the toil of the centuries as of no account. It is good sense: 
itself which speaks in reflections like these : — 
‘Tf man is not taught what is good, he will necessarily. 
become preoccupied with what is bad. The mind and the 
heart cannot remain unoccupied.... On the pretext of 
affording children an experience which is their own, they are 
deprived of the assistance of others’ experience.” 
386. History AVENGED OF THE DispaIn or Rousszav. — 
The sophisms of Rousseau on history are brilliantly refuted. 
History is within the comprehension of the youngest. The 
child who can understand Tom Thumb and Blue Beard, can 
understand the history of Romulus- and of Clovis. More- 
over, it is to the history of the most recent times that 
La Chalotais attaches the greatest importance, and in this 
respect he goes beyond his master Rollin :— 
‘¢ I would have composed for the use of the child histories 
of every nation, of every century, and particularly of the 
later centuries, which should be written with greater detail, 
and which should be réad before those of the more remote 
eentaries. I would have written the lives of illustrious men 
of all classes, conditions, and professions, of celebrated 
heroes, scholars, women, and children.” 
887. Grocraruy. — La Chalotais does not separate the 
study of geography from that of history, and he requires 
that, without entering into dry and tedious details, the pupil 
be made to travel pleasantly through different countries, and 
that stress be put ‘‘ on what is of chief importance and inter- 
est in each country, such as the most striking facts, the 
native land of great men, celebrated battles, and whatever 
is most notable, either as to manners and customs, te 
natural productions, or to arts and commerce.”
-P-A-G-E-382
850 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
388. Naturat History. Another study especially 
adapted to children, says La Chalotais with’ reason, is 
natural history: ‘The principal thing-is ‘first to show the 
different objects just as they appear to the eyes. A repre- 
sentation of them, with a precise and exact description, is 
sufficient.” 
‘Too great detail must be avoided, and the objects chosen 
must be such as. are most directly related to us, which are 
the most necessary and the most useful.” 
“¢ Preference shall be given to domestic animals over those 
that are wild, and to native animals over those of other 
countries. In the case of plants, preference shall be given 
to those that serve for food and for use in medicine.” 
As far as possible, the object itself should be shown, so 
that the idea shall be the more exact and vivid, and the 
impression the more durable. 
889. Recreations mv Pnysics. — La Chalotais explains 
that he means by this phrase observations, experiments, and 
.. the simplest facts of nature. Children should early be made 
acquainted with thermometers, barometers, with the micro- 
scope, etc. 
390. Recreations In Marnematics. — All this is excellent, 
and La Chalotais enters resolutely into the domain of modern 
methods. What is more debatable is the idea of putting 
geometry and mathematics into the programme of children’s 
studies, under this erroneous pretext, that ‘‘ geometry pre- 
sents nothing but the sensible and the palpable.” Let us 
grant, however, that it is easier to conceive “‘ clear ideas of 
bodies, lines, and angles that strike the eyes, than abstract 
ideas of verbs, declensions, and conjugations, of an accusa- 
tive, an ablative, a subjunctive, an infinitive, or of the 
omitted that.”
-P-A-G-E-383
ORIGIN OF LAY AND NATIONAL INSTRUCTION. : $51 
_ 891. Sropies or THE Seconp Periop. — La Chalotais post- 
pones the study. of the classical languages till the second 
period, the tenth year. The course of study for this second 
period will comprise: 1. French and Latin literature, or ‘the 
humanities; 2. a continuation of history, geography, math- 
ematics, and natural history; 3. criticism, logic, and meta- 
physics; 4. the art of invention; 5. ethics. 
La Chalotais complains that his contemporaries neglect 
French literature, as though we had not admirable models in 
our national language. Out of one hundred pupils there are 
not five who will find it useful to write in Latin; while there 
is not one of them who will have occasion to speak .or write 
in Greek, and to construct Latin verses. All, on the.con- 
trary, ought to know their native language. Consequently, 
our author suggests the idea of devoting the morning session 
to French, and that of the afternoon to Latin, so that the 
pupils who have no need of the ancient languages may pur- 
sue only the courses in French. 
$92. Tue Livine Laneuaces. ~~ La Chalotais thinks the 
knowledge of two living languages to be necessary, ‘‘ the 
English for science, and the German for war.” German 
literature had not yet produced its masterpieces, and it is 
seen that at this period the utility of German appears espe- 
cially with reference to military affairs. However it may be, 
let us be-grateful to him for having appreciated, as he has 
.done, the living languages. ‘‘It is wrong,” he says, ‘‘ to 
treat them nearly as we treat our contemporaries, with a sort 
-of indifference. Without. the Greek and Latin languages 
‘there is no real and solid erudition; and there is no complete 
‘erudition without the others.”

tion, as upon the teaching of the ancient ldipaapes, which La 
Chalotais, however, is wrong in restrictitg to too bmall a 
number of years; upon the necessity of presenting to pupils 
as subjects for composition, not puerile’ aniplifieations, or 
dissertations o on facts or matters of which they até ignorant, 
‘their occupations, their amusemehts, or ‘their troubles ” ; 
‘upon logic or criticism, the study of whieh should not be 
deferred till the end of the course, as ié still done in our day ; 
‘upon philosophy, which is, he bays, ‘the characteristic of 
the eighteenth century, as that of the sixteenth was erudition, 
‘and’ tliat of the seventeenth was talent!” La Chalotais 
‘reserves the place of honor to ethics, ‘‘ which is the most 
‘important of all the sciences, and which is, as muchas any 
other, susceptible of demonstration.” 
394. Tue Question or Booxs. — In tracing his programme 
of studies, so new in many particulars, La Chalotais took 
into account the difficulties that would be encountered in 
assuring, and, so to speak, in improvising, the execution 
of it, at a time when there existed neither competent teachers 
nor properly constructed books. ‘Teachers especially, he 
said, are difficult to train. But, while waiting for the re- 
eruiting of the teaching force, La Chalotais puts great de-— 
‘pendence on elementary books, which might, he thought, be 
composed within two years, if the king would encourage the 
publication of them, and if the Academies would put them 
up for competition. 
*¢These books would be the best instruction which the mas- 
fers could give, and would take the place of every other 
method. Whatever course we may take, we cannot dispense 
_with new books. These books, once made, would make 
_trained: teachers unnecessary, and there would then be no 
longer any occasion for discussion as to their qualities,
-P-A-G-E-385
ORIGIN OF LAY AND NATIONAL rnsrebction, $858 
whether they should be priests, or married, or single. - A. 
would be good, provided they were religious, moral, and 
knew how to read; they would soon train themselves while 
training their pupils.” 
There is much exaggeration in these words. The book, as 
we know, cannot supply the place of teachers. . But the lan- 
guage of La Chalotais was adapted to circumstances as they 
existed. He spoke in this way, because, in his impatience 
to reach his end, he would try to remedy the educutional 
poverty of ‘his time, and supply the lack of good teachers-by 
provisional expedients, by means which he found withiti his 
reach. 
395.. Arisrocraric Presupices. — That which we would 
expunge from the book of La Chalotais is his opinion on pri- 
mary instruction. Blinded by some unexplained distrust of 
the people, and dominated by aristocratic tendencies, he com- 
plains of the extension of instruction. He demands that the 
knowledge of the poor do not extend beyond their pursuits. 
He bitterly criticises the thirst for knowledge which is begin- 
ning to pervade the lower classes of the nation. 
‘* Even the people can study. Laborers and artisans send 
thelr children to the colleges of the smaller cities... Wheri 
these children have accomplished a summary course of study 
which has taught them only to disdain the occupation of their 
father, they rush into the cloisters and become ecclesiastics ; 
or they exercise judicial functions, and often become subjects 
harmful to society. The Brethren of the Christian Doctrine 
(sic), who are called ignorantins, have just appeared to com- 
plete the general ruin; they teach people to read and write 
who ought to learn only to draw, and to handle the plane and 
the file, but have no disposition to do it. They are the tivale 
or the successors of the Jesuits.” 
A singular force of prejudice was necessary to conceive that
-P-A-G-E-386
854 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY.: 
the Brethren of the Christian Schools were instructing the 
people too highly. 
Let it be said, however, towards exonerating La Chalotais, 
that he perhaps does not so much attack the instruction in 
itself, as the bad way in which it is given. What he censures 
is instruction that is badly conceived, that which takes people 
from their own class. In some other passages of his book 
we sce that he would be disposed to. disseminate the new 
education among the ranks of the people. 
<¢It is the State, it is the larger part of the nation, that 
must be kept principally in view in education; for twenty 
millions of men ought to be held in greater consideration 
than one million, and the peasantry, who are not yet a class in 
France, as they are in Sweden, ought not to be neglected in a 
system of instruction. Education is equally solicitous that 
Jetters should be cultivated, and that the fields should be 
plowed ; that all the sciences and the useful arts should be 
perfected ; that justice should be administered and that relig- 
ion should be taught; that there should be instructed and 
competent generals, magistrates, and ecclesiastics, and skill- 
ful artists and citizens, all in fit proportion. It is for the 
government to make each citizen so pleased with his condi- 
tion that he may not be forced to withdraw from it.” 
Let us quote one sentence more, which is almost the for- 
youla that to-day is so dear to the friends of instruction : — 
** We do not fear to assert, in general, that in the condi- 
tion in which Europe now is, the people that are the most 
enlightened will always have the advantage over those who 
are the less so.” 
396. GrnrraL Conciuston. — Notwithstanding the fault 
which mar it, the work of La Chalotais is none the less one of 
the most remarkable essays of the earlier French pedagogy. 
+ La Chalotais,” says Gréard, “+ belongs .to the: school of
-P-A-G-E-387
ORIGIN OF LAY AND NATIONAL INSTRUCTION. 855 ~ 
Rousseau; but on more than one point he departs from thé - 
plan traced by the master. He escapes from the allurementa 
of the paradox. Relatively he has the spirit of moderation. 
He is a classic without prejudices, an innovator without _ 
temerity.” 
His book is pre-eminently a book of polemics, written with 
the ardor of one who is engaged in a fight, and overflowing 
with a generous passion. What noble words are the fol- 
lowing : — : 
‘Let the young man learn what bread a ploughman, a 
day laborer, or an artisan eats. He’ will see in the sequel 
how they are deprived of the bread which they earn with so 
much difficulty, and how one portion of men live at the ex- 
pense of the other.” 
In these lines, which breathe a sentiment of profound pity 
for the disinherited of this world, we already hear, as it were, 
the signal cry announcing the social reclamations of the 
French Revolution. 
379. Roiianp (1734-1794). — La Chalotais, after hav- 
ing criticised the old methods, proposed new ones; Rolland 
attempted to put them in practice. La Chalotais is a polemic 
and a theorist ; Rolland is an administrator. President of the 
Parliament of Paris, he presented to his colleagues, in 1768, 
a Report which is a real system of education.’ But above 
all, he gave his personal attention to the administration of 
the College Louis-le-Grand. An ardent and impassioned 
adversary of the Jesuits, he used every means to put public 
instruction in a condition to do without them. ‘* Noble and 
wise spirit, patient and courageous reason, who, for twenty 
years, even during exile and after the dissolution of his 
‘society, did not abandon for a single moment the work: he

had undertaken, but brought: it, almost «perfected, to the 
very confines of the Revolution; a heart divested of every 
ambition, who, chosen by popular wish, and by the cabinet 
of the king, as director of public instruction, obstinately 
entrenched himself in the peace of his studious retreat.” This 
is the judgment of a member of the University, in. the nine- 
teenth century, Dubois, director of the Normal School. 
No doubt Rolland is not an original educator. “It is in 
Rollin’s Traité des études,” he says, ‘‘ that every teacher will 
find the true rules for education.” Besides, he borrowed 
ideas from La Chalotais, and also from the Mémoires which 
the University of Paris drew up in 1763 and 1764 at the 
request of Parliament; so that the interegt.in his work is 
less, perhaps, in its personal views than in the indications 
it furnishes relative to the situation of the University and 
its tendency towards self-reformation. — 
398. InstRucTION wirHiIn THE Reaca or ALL.— At least 
on one point Rolland is superior to La Chalotais; he takes a 
bold stand for the necessity of primary instruction, and for 
the progress and diffusion of human knowledge. 
“‘ Education cannot be too widely diffused, to the end that 
there may be no class of citizens who may not be brought to 
participate in its benefits. It is expedient that each citizen 
receive the education which is adapted to his needs.” * 
It is true that Rolland joins in the wish expressed by the 
University, which demanded a reduction in the number of 
colleges. But only colleges for the higher studies were in 
question, and Rolland thought less of restricting instruction 
than of proportioning and adapting it to the needs of the 
different classes of society. . 
‘+ Hach one ought to have the opportunity to. receive ‘the 
‘education which is adapted to his needs. . . . Now each

soil,” adds Rolland, ‘‘ is not susceptible of the same culture 
and the same product. Each mind does. not demand the 
same degree of culture. All men have neither the same 
needs nor the same talents; and it is in proportion to these 
talents and.these needs that public education ought to be 
regulated.” 
Rolland shared the prejudices of La Chalotais against ‘the 
new Order founded by La Salle’”’; but none the less on this 
account did he demand instruction for all. 
“The knowledge of reading and writing, which is the key 
to all the other sciences, ought to be universally diffused. 
Without this the teachings of the clergy are useless, for the 
memory is rarely faithful enough; and reading alone can 
impress in a durable manner what it is important never to 
forget.” Would it be granted by every one to-day, affected 
by prejudices that are ever re-appearing, that ‘‘ the laborer 
who has received some sort of instruction is but the more 
diligent and the more skillful by reason of it ”? 
899. Tags Normat Scuoor.— We shall not. dwell upon 
the methods and schemes of study proposed by Rolland. 
Save very urgent recommendations relative to the study of 
the national history and of the French language, we. shall 
find nothing very new in them. What deserve to be pointed 
out, by way of compensation, are the important innovations 
which he wished to introduce into the general organization 
of public instruction. 
First there was the idea of a higher normal achool, of a 
seminary for professors. The University had already 
expressed the wish that such an establishment should be 
founded. To be convinced how much this pedagogical sem- 
inary, conceived as far back as 1763, resembled our actual 
Normal School, it suffices to note the following details. The 
establishment was to be governed by professors drawn from
-P-A-G-E-390
858 THE HISTORY OF ‘PEDAGOGY. © 
the different faculties, according to’ thé ‘different subjects of 
instruction. The young men received on competitive exam- 
ination were to be divided into three classes, corresponding, 
to the three grades of admission. Within the establishment 
they were to take part in a series of discussions, after = 
given time to submit to the tests for graduation, and finally 
to be placed in the colleges. Is it not trae that there was 
no important addition to be made to this scheme? Rolland 
also required that pedagogics have a place among the studies 
of these future professors, and that definite and systematic 
instruction be given in this art, so important to the teachers 
of youth. 
Rolland does not stop even there. He provides for 
inspectors, or visitors, who are to examine all the colleges 
each year. Finally, he subjects all scholastic establishments 
to one single authority, to a council of the government, to 
which he applies the rather odd title, the ‘‘ Bureau of Corre- 
spondence.” 
400. Seirrt or. CenrralizaTion. — Whatever opinion 
may be formed of absolute centralization, which, in our cen- 
tary, has become the law of public instruction, and has 
caused the disappearance of provincial franchises, it is certain 
that the parliamentarians of the eighteenth century were the 
first to conceive it and desire it, if not to realize it. Paris, in 
Rolland’s plan, becomes the centre of public instruction. 
‘The universities distributed through the provinces are co-or- 
dinated and made dependent on that of Paris. 
‘Ts it not desirable,” said Rolland, ‘‘ that the good taste 
which everything concurs to produce in the capital, be dif- 
fused to the very extremities of the kingdom; that every 
Frenchman participate in the treasures of knowledge which 
are there accumulating from day to day ; that the young men 
who have the same country, who are destined to serve the same

prince and to fulfill the same functions, receive the same les- 
sons and be imbued with the same maxims; that one part of 
France be not under the clouds of ignorance while letters 
shed the purest light in another; in a word, that the time 
come when a young man educated in a province cannot be 
distinguished from one who has been trained in the cap- 
ital?” ~ And he adds that ‘‘ the only means for attaining an 
end 80 desirable is to make Paris the centre of public instruc- 
tion.’ 
Besides the gain that will thus accrue to instruction, Rolland 
sees this other advantage, that, through uniformity in instruc- 
tion, there will be secured a uniformity in manners and: in 
laws. By means of a uniform education, ‘the young men 
of all the provinces will divest themselves of all their preju- 
dices of birth; they will form the same ideas of virtue and 
justice; they will demand uniform laws, which would have 
offended their fathers.” 
By this means, finally, there will be developed a national 
spirit, a national character, and a national jurisprudence, 
“the only means of recreating love of country.” Is it not 
true that the great magistrates of the close of the eighteenth 
century deserve also to be counted among the founders of 
French unity? 
401. Turcor (1727-1781).—In his Mémoires to the king 
(1775), Turgot set forth analogous ideas, and also demanded 
the formation of a council of public instruction. He made 
an eloquent plea for the establishment of a civil and national 
education which should be extended. to the country at large. 
*¢ Your kingdom, Sir, is of this world. Without opposing 
any obstacle to the instructions whose object is higher, and 
which already have their rules and. their expounders, I 
think I can propose to you nothing of more advantage to 
your people than to cause to be given to all your subjects an

instruction which shows them the obligations they owe to 
society and to your power which protects them, the duties 
which those obligations impose on them, and the interest 
which they have in fulfilling those duties for the public good 
and their own. ‘This moral and social instruction requires 
- books expressly prepared, by competition, and with great 
care, and a schoolmaster in each parish to teach them to 
children, along with the art of writing, reading, counting, 
measuring, and the principles of mechanics.” 
“The study of the duty of citizenship ought to be the 
foundation of all the other studies.” : 
‘¢There are methods and establishments for training 
geometricians, physicists, and painters, but there are none 
for training citizens.” 
In a word, La Chalotais, Rolland, Turgot, and some of 
their contemporaries, were real precursors of the French 
Revolution in the matter of education. At the date of 1762 
the scholastic revolution began, at least so far as secondary 
instruction is concerned. The Parliaments of that period 
conceived the plan of the University of the nineteenth cen- 
tury, and prepared for the work of Napoleon I. But they 
left to the men of the Revolution the honor of being the first 
to organize primary instruction. 
(402. Anatytica, Summary. — 1. This study exhibits the 
evils brought upon a country by an education controlled and 
administered by a dominant Church for the attainment of 
its own ends; and also the efforts of a nation to save itself 
from imminent disaster by making the State the great public 
educator. . 
2. The right of the State to self-preservation is the vindi- 
cation of its right to control and direct public education. 
The State thus becomes the patron of the public school;

the product it requires is good citizenship; and for the sake 
of securing this product the State endows the school, wholly 
or in part. 
8. The situation in France, as described in this study, is 
an aggravated case of what may occur whenever education is 
administered by a class having special interests and -ambi- 
tions ; and under some form there must be the intervention 
of the State as a means of protecting its own interests. 
4. When education is administered in the main by the 
literary class, there is some danger that the instruction may 
not be that which is best adapted to the needs of other 
classes. ]

404. Contrapicrory JUDGMENTS ON THE WoRK OF THE 
Revorution. — An historian of education in France, Théry, 
opens his chapter on the Revolution with these contemptuous 
words, ‘‘One does not study a void, one does not analyze a 
negation.”! A more recent historian of public instruction 
during the Revolution, Albert Duruy, arriving at the work 
of Condorcet, certainly the most important undertaking of 
    
1 Théry, Histoire de l éducation en France, Paris, 1861, Tome Il. p. 188.

, THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. » 868 
the pedagogy of the Revolution, does not hesitate to record 
this absolute and summary judgment: ‘We are-now no 
longer in the real and in the possible; we are travelling in 
the land of chimeras; we are soaring in space at heights 
which admit of only ideal attainment.”! © 
How easy it is to say this! To ‘believe these facile 
judges, one who would estimate the efforts of the Revolu- 
tion in the matter of public instruction would have to choose 
between a nothing and a chimera. The men of the Revola- 
tion have done nothing, say some; they are dreamers and 
idealists, say others. 
These assertions do not bear examination. For every 
impartial observer it is certain that the Revolution opened a 
new era in education, and the proof of this is to be found in 
the very documents that our opponents so triflingly condemn, - 
‘and the practical spirit of which they misconceive. 
405. GeNERAL CHARACTER oF THAT Work.— It is not 
that the men.of the Revolution were educators:in the strict 
sense of the term. The science of education is not indebted 
to them for new methods. They have not completed the 
work of Locke, of Rousseau, and of La Chalotais; but 
they were the first to attempt a legislative organization of a 
vast system of public instruction. It is just to place them 
in the front rank of the men who might be called ‘ educa- 
tional. statesmen.” Doubtless they lacked time for apply- 
ing their ideas, but they had at least the merit .of having 
conceived these ideas, and of having embodied them in 
legislative acts. The principles which we proclaim to-day, 
they formulated. “The solutions which we attempt to put in 
practice after a century of waiting, were decreed by them.

decreés which constitutes the pedagogical work ‘of the Rev- 
olution’ will have ‘witnessed the genesis of popular instruc: 
‘tion in France. 
406. Tae Srate or Primary Insrevction. —In order 
to form a proper appreciation of the merits of the men of 
the Revolution, it is first necessary to consider in what a 
deplorable state they found primary instruction. What a 
contrast between that which they hoped to do and the actual 
situation in 1789! I very well know that fancy sketches 
have been drawn of the old régime. A very showy enu- 
meration has been made of the number of colleges; but we 
have not been told how many of these colleges had no pro- 
fessors, and how many had no pupils. And so of the 
_ schools; they are found everywhere, but it remains to be 
shown what was taught in them, and whether anything was 
taught in them." 
'- Party writers who are bound to gainsay the work of the 
French Revolution in the matter of education, generally put 
under contribution, to serve their political prejudices, the old 
communal archives. They cite imaginary statistics which 
prove, for example, that in the diocese of Rouen, in 1718, 
there were 855 schools for boys, and 306 schools for girls, 
for a territory of 1159 parishes. 
It is first necessary to verify these statistics, whose accu- 
racy has not been demonstrated, and whose figures were 
evidently obtained only by counting a school wherever the 
rector of the parish gave lessons in reading and in the cate- 
chism to three or four children. 
But there are other replies to make to the traducers of the 
Revolution who tax their ingenuity to prove that instruction 
was flourishing under the old régime, and that the Revolution 
  1J. Simon, Dieu, patrie, et liberté, p. 14.
-P-A-G-E-397
‘ THE FRENCH REVOLUTION -     ‘destroyed imore than it created. With this assumed 
rescence of schools of which we hear, it is necessary t6 
contrast the results as shown by authentic statistics of the 
number of illiterates. In 1790 there was 53 per cent of men 
‘and 78 per cent of women who could not sign | heir ‘names 
to their marriage contracts. 
Besides, we ‘must inquire what was taught in these’ pre- 
tended schools, how many children attended them, and what 
was the material and moral condition of the teachers who 
directed them. 
407. WHat was Tavent mm THE ScHoots. = Instruction 
was reduced to the catechism, to reading and writing. On 
this point there can be no dispute. The offidial pro- 
gramme of the Brethren of the Christian Schools did not go 
beyond this. The ordinance of Louis XIV., dated in 1698, 
has been poinpously quoted. 
«We would have appointed,” it is there said, ‘(as far as 
it shall be possible, masters and mistresses in all the ‘pat- 
_ishes where there are none, to instruct all children, and in 
“particular those whose parents have made profession of the 
pretended reformed religion, in the catechism and the prayers 
which are necessary; to take them to mass on every work 
day; and also to teach reading and writing to those who will 
need this knowledge.” 
But does not this very text support those who miintain 
that the Monarchy and the Church have never encouraged 
primary instruction except as required by the necessities of 
‘the struggle against heresy, and that primary instruction 
under the old régime was scarcely more than an instrument 
‘of religious domination? 
Most often the school was simply a place to which parents 
sent their children for temporary care. Writing was not 
always taught in it. A school-mistress of Haute-Marne
-P-A-G-E-398
866 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
-was forbidden to teach writing ‘for fear her pupils might 
employ their knowledge in writing love-letters.” 
408. Discrpiine. — Corporal punishments were more than 
ever the order of the day. The bishop of Montpellier, at 
the end of the seventeenth century, forbids, it is true, beat- 
ing with sticks, kicks, and raps on the head; but he author- 
‘izes the ferule and the rod, on the condition that the patient 
_be not completely exposed. 
409. Conpitron or THE TEacuERS. — That which is graver 
still is that the teachers themselves (I speak of lay teachers, 
_ Who, it is true, were not numerous) lived in a wretched con- 
dition, without material independence and without- moral 
dignity. In general, there were no fixed salaries. Wages 
,varied from 40 to 200 francs, arbitrarily fixed by the vestry- 
board or by the community, in return for a great number of 
_Services the most various and the least exalted. The school- 
_masters were far less teachers than sextons, choristers, 
beadles, bell-ringers, clock-makers, and even grave-diggers. 
. “ Attendance at marriages and at burials was counted at the 
,tate of 15 sols and dinner for marriages, and 20 sols for 
burials.” And Albert Duruy concludes that in this there 
_Were substantial advantages to the school-masters ;'— advan- 
tages dearly bought in every case, and repudiated by those 
/ who were interested in them. ‘The more services we ren 
der the community,’ said the teachers of Bourgogne in theit 
‘complaints in 1789, ‘the more we are degraded.”? ‘The 
. school-masters were scarcely more than the domestics of the

Thus there was no assured salary, arid sontdeqtenity ne

granted his approbation, or permission to. teach, after an 
examination of the most summary kind. . The. duties ‘of 
teaching were the means of subsistence which were: accepted 
without call and without serious preparation. In Provence, 
school-masters attended kinds of ‘‘ teachers’ fairs” for tha 
purpose of being hired. In the Alps, teachers were numer- 
ous, but only in winter. They tarried in the plain .and in 
the valleys only during the inclement season. They returned 
home for the labors of the summer. 
Consequently, most of the schools existed only in name. 
“ The schools,’’ we are told,! ‘‘ were in vacation for four or 
five months.” For a half of the year, the school-masters 
were free to follow another trade, or, rather, to devote themi« 
selyes more completely to their ordinary trade, which their 
school duties did not always interrupt.

time as a:domicile for the school-master and his family, and 
as a class-room for pupils, Benches and tables were things 
rarely seen, ‘and pupils wrote while standing. 
In a word, the state of primary instruction, when the 
States-General opened in 1789, was as follows: schools 
few in number and poorly attended ; few lay teachers, trained 
no one knows how, without thorough instruction, and, as 
they themselves said, ‘‘degradéd” by their inferior position ; 
few or no elementary books; gratuity only. partial ; - finally, 
a general indifference for elementary instruction, which phil- 
osophers like Voltaire, and Rousseau, and Parliamentarians 
like La Chalotais, themselves lightly esteemed. 
:, 412. Tue Proven Work or THE Revotution. —I do not 
say that the Revolution accomplished all that there was to be 
attempted in order to bring instruction up to the needs of the 
new society ; but it purposed to do this. Every time a lib- 
eral ministry has decided to work for the promotion of in- 
struction, it has revived its plans; and it is these same plans 
that. by a vigorous effort’ public authority has attempted to 
realize in: recent times. 
’ 413. Tue Reports or 1789. — Already, in the reports of 
1789, public opinion vigorously pronounced itself in favor of 
educational reforms. ‘‘ The cahiers of 1789, even those 
of the clergy and the nobility, demand the reorganization of 
public instruction on a comprehensive plan. . The cahiers 
of the clergy of Rodez and of Saumur demand ‘ that there 
may be formed a plan of national education for the young’; 
those of Lyons, that education be restricted ‘to a teaching 
body whose members may not be removable except for neg- 
Kigence, misconduct, or incapacity; that if may no longer be 
conducted according to arbitrary principles, and that all pub- 
lic instructors be obliged to conform to a uniform plan

adopted by the States-General.’ The cahier’s of. the nobility’ - 
of Lyons insist that ‘a national character’ be impressed on 
the education of both sexes, Those of Paris demand ‘that. 
public education be perfected, and extended to all classes of 
citizens.’ Those of Blois, ‘ that there be established a coun- 
cil composed of the most enlightened scholars of the capital 
and of the provinces and of the citizens of the different 
orders, to form a plan of national education, for. the use of 
all the classes of society, and to edit elementary treatises.’”’ * 
414. Mrrapeac (1749-1791).— From the first days of 
the Revolution, pedagogical literature abounds, and gives evi- 
dence of the ever-growing interest which public opinion 
attaches to educational questions. The Oratorians, of whom 
La Chalotais said, ‘‘ that they were free from the prejudices 
of the school and of the cloister, and that they were citi- 
zens,” present to the National Assembly a series of scholastic 
plans. On its part, the Assembly sets itself at work; Tal- 
leyrand prepares his great report, and Mirabeau embodies his 
own reflections in four eloquent discourses. 
Mirabeau’s discourses, published after his death through 
the good offices of his friend Cabanis, had the following 
titles: 1. Draft of a Law for the Organization of the Teach- 
ing Body; 2. Public and Military Festivals; 38. Organiza- 
tion of a National Lycée; 4. The Education of the Heir 
Presumptive of the Crown.

- ignorance, and their motives are not difficult to appreciate ; 
but they do not know that when they have made a wild beast 
of a man, they expose themselves to the momentary danger 
of seeing him transformed into a savage beast. Without in- 
telligence there is no morality. But on whom, then, is it 
important to bestow intelligence, if it is not upon the rich? 
Is not the safeguard of their enjoyments the morality of the 
people? Through the influence of the laws, through that ot 
a wise administration, through the efforts to which each one 
should be inspired by the hope of ameliorating the condition 
of his fellows, exert yourselves, public and private citizens, 
to diffuse in all quarters the noble fruits of knowledge. 
Believe that in dissipating one single error, in propagating 
one single wholesome truth, you will do something for the 
happiness of the human race ; and whoever you are, do not 
have the least doubt that it is only by this means that you 
can assure your own happiness.” 
’ But through some inexplicable spirit of timidity, Mirabeau 
did not draw from these principles the consequences that 
they permit. He does not admit that the State can impose 
the obligation to attend school. 
- * Society,” he says, “has not the right to prescribe in- 
struction as a duty.... Public authority has not the right, 
with respect to the members of the social body, to go beyond 
the limits of watchfulness against injustice and of protection 
against violence... .” ‘* Society,” he adds, ‘‘ can exact of 
each one only the sacrifices necessary for the maintenance 
of the liberty and the safety of all.” 
Mirabeau forgets that the obligation to send children to 
school is exactly one of those necessary sacrifices which the 
State has the right to impose on parents. 
Hostile to obligation, Mirabeau feels no greater partisan- 
ship for gratuity : —
-P-A-G-E-403
_ THE FRENCH REVOLUTION: Si1 
‘Gratuitous education,” he said, ‘‘is paid for by every~ 
body, while its fruits are immediately gathered by only a 
small number of individuals.” 
416. Liperry or Teacuine. — Like so many other gener- 
ous spirits, Mirabeau cherished the dream of the most com- 
plete liberty of teaching.? / 
‘«Your single purpose,”’ he said to the members, ‘is to give 
to man the use of all his faculties, to make him enjoy all his 
  
1 What is meant by “liberty of teaching ” will be better understood from 
the following quotations from the Dictionnaire de Pédagogie, Premitre 
Partie, p. 1575 et seq.: 
“ Liberty of teaching, in a country which has proclaimed obligatory in- 
struction, is the equal right of all to give that instruction, or the prohibition 
of every monopoly which would put that instruction into the hands either 
of privileged individuals, or of corporations, or even of the State, to the 
exclusion of every other teaching body.”” 
“Under the old régime, the education of the masses was committed to 
the hands of the Church; the colleges, directed by a body of men who were 
all ecclesiastics, gave ‘a vain pretence of an education, where the memory 
alone was exercised, and where the reason was insulted in the forms of 
reasoning.’ ”” 
“The purpose of the men of the Revolution was, then, above all else, to 
emancipate science, and to guarantee the right of free inquiry; and while 
rescuing instruction from the tyranny of the Church, to assure to citizens 
in general the opportunity to acquire the knowledge that is essential to 
man. On the one hand, they would take precautions against the abuse 
of power by a government which had always shown itself hostile to free 
thought . ..; on the other, in opposition to the old doctrine which con- 
demned the people to ignorance, they proclaimed the duty of the State to 
create a system of public instruction, common to all citizens.” 
“Tt is at this point of view that we must place ourserves in order to gain 
a correct notion of the plans that were submitted to the Constituent Con- 
vention and the Legislative Assembly. What Talleyrand and Condorcet 
desired was, first, to organize, under the form of a public service, a system 
of national education in which all might participate; and in the second 
place, to take precautions against the Church and the royal authority, and 
80 prevent despotic power from attempting to prevent the development of © 
new truths and the teaching of theories which it judged contrary to its 
policy and interests. For them, liberty of teaching is the demand of phik 
osophic liberty against ecclesiastical and secular authority.” (P.)

rights, to develop the corporate life out of all the individuay 
lives freely developed, and the will of the whole out of ali 
personal wills.” 
417. Duisrrpurion or Srupies. — In Mirabeau’s plan, 
public and national instruction depends, not on the executive 
power, but on ‘ the magistrates who truly represent the peo~ 
ple, that is to say, who are elected and often renewed by the 
people,” — in other terms, the officers of departments or dis- 
tricts. Establishments for instruction ought not to form a 
consolidated body. 
Let us observe, finally, that by the side of the primary 
schools Mirabeau established a college of literature for each 
department, and at Paris, a single National Lycée, ‘designed 
to secure to a select number of French youth the means of 
finishing their education.” In this he established a chair of 
method, which, he said, ought to be the basis of instruction. 
In conclusion, the work of Mirabeau is but a very imper- 
fect sketch, and a sort of graduated transition between the 
old and the new régime. 
We do not yet find in it the grand ideas which are to 
impassion men, and it is the Rapport of Talleyrand which 
constitutes the real introduction to the educational work of 
the Revolution. : 
418. Tue Constirvmnt AssemBLy AND TaLLEYRAND. — 
The constitution of Sept. 4, 1791, announced the following 
provision : — 
“There shall be created and organized a-system of public 
instruction, common to all citizens, and gratuitous with re- 
spect to those branches of instruction which are indispensable 
for all men.” 
It was to put in force the decree of the Constitution that 
Talleyrand drew up his Rapport and presented it to the
-P-A-G-E-405
THE FRENCH REVOLUTION? B73 
Assembly at the sessions of September 10° and 11.. The 
entire bill contained not less than 208. articles. Having 
reached the term of its troubled existence, the Assembly did 
not find the time to discuss it, and, whilé regretting ‘* not 
having established the bases of the regeneration-of educa- 
tion,” it referred the examination of Talleyrand’s work to 
the Legislative Assembly. 
The Legislative Assembly showed. but little anxiety to 
accept the legacy of its predecessor. Another. report, that 
of Condorcet, was prepared, so that the bill of Talleyrand 
never had the honor of a parliamentary discussion. 
419. Tatterranp (1758-1838). — The ex-bishop ‘of 
Autun, having become a revolutionist of 1789, before being 
the chamberlain of Napoleon I.. and the minister of Louis 
XVIII., scarcely deserves by his character the esteem of 
history; he too often gave a striking example of political 
versatility. But at least, by his supple and acute intelli- 
gence, and by the abundance of his ideas, he has always 
risen to the height of the various tasks that he has under- 
taken, and his Rapport is a remarkable work. 
420. GENERAL PrincipLes.— As Montesquieu has saidy 
“ the laws of: education ought to be relative to the principles 
of government.” It is by this truth that Talleyrand. is 
inspired in the long considerations that serve as a. preamble 
to his bill. 
What was to be done in the presence of a constitution 
which, limiting the powers of the king, called. the entire -peo- 
ple to participate in political life? That constitution would 
have remained sterile, would have been but a dead letter, if 
a suitable education had not come to vivify it by causing i it 
to pass, so to speak, into the blood of the nation. In what 
did the new régime consist? You have separated, ‘said

3874 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
Talleyrand to the members, you have separated the will of 
the whole, or the:power of making the laws, from the execu- 
tive power, which. you have reserved to the king. But that 
general will must be upright, and, in order to be upright, it 
must be enlightened and instructed. After having given 
power to the people, you ought to teach them wisdom. Of 
what use would it be toenfranchise brutal and unconscious 
forces, to turn them over to their own keeping? Instruction 
is the necessary counterpoise of liberty. The law, which is 
henceforth the work of the people, ought not to be at the 
mercy of the tumultuous opinions of an ignorant multitude. 
- 421. Epucation aS RELATED TO Laperty AND Equatiry. 
—Talleyrand is pleased with his thought, and, considering 
in turn the two: fundamental -ideas of the Revolution, the 
idea of equality and the idea of liberty, he shows, not with- 
out some length of analysis, that instruction is necessary, on 
‘the one hand, to create free individuals, by giving to them a 
conscience and.a reason, and on the other, to draw men 
‘together by diminishing the inequality of intelligences. 
422. Rutes ror Posuic Instruction. — Instruction is 
due to all.: There must be schools in the villages as in the 
cities. Instruction ought to be given by all; there ought to 
be'no privilege in instruction. Finally, instruction ought to 
extend to all subjects ; everything shall be taught which can 
be taught : — 
‘¢In a well organized society, though no one can attain to 
universal knowledge, it should nevertheless be possible to 
learn everything.”

tics became the almost exclusive preoccupation ‘ofthe 
educators of youth. Everything else — religion, iecuracy 
of judgment, nobility of heart —is relegated to the: second 
place: man is nothing more than a political animal,‘bronght 
into the world to know, to love, and to obey the constitution, 
The Declaration of the Rights of Man became,:in the :sys- 
tem of Talleyrand, the catechism of childhood. It is neced- 
sary that the future citizen learn to know, to love, to obey, 
and finally to perfect the constitution. We cannot help 
thinking that Talleyrand himself showed a marvellous ‘epti- 
tude for loving and obeying the constitution, Unfortunately 
this has not always been the case! 
424, Unrversat Moraxiry. — One of the most. beautiful 
pages of Talleyrand’s work is certainly that in which. he 
recommends the teaching of universal morality, and claims 
the autonomy of natural Jaws, distinct. from: all positive 
religion. 
“We must learn to infuse ourselves with morality, which 
is the first need of all constitutions... . Morality .must be 
taught as a real science, whose principles will -be demon- 
strated to the reason of all men, and to that of all-ages. It 
is only in this way that it will resist all trials. It. has long 
been a matter of lamentation to see men of all nations and 
of all religions make it depend exclusively on that multitude 
of opinions which divide them. From this have resulted 
great evils; for abandoning morality to. uncertainty, and 
often to absurdity, it has necessarily been compromised ; it 
has been made versatile and unsettled. It is time to estab- 
lish it upon its own bases, and to show men ‘that if banefil

divisions separate them, they at least have in morality a 
common meeting place where they all ought to take refuge 
and unite for protection. It is necessary, then, to detach it 
in some sort from everything else, in order to reunite it at 
once to that which merits our approval and our homage. 
... This change is simple and injures nothing; above ail, 
it is possible. How is it possible not to see, in fact, that 
abstraction being made of every system and of every opinion, 
and by. considering in men only their relations with otber 
men, they can be taught what is good and just, made to love 
it, and made to find happiness in virtuous actions and 
wretchedness in those which are not so?” 
425. Four Grapes or Instrucron. — The organization 
of instruction, in Talleyrand’s bill, -vas ‘to be combined 
with that of the government,” and to bo modeled after the 
division of administrative functions. The Rapport estab- 
lished four grades of instruction. There was.a school for 
each canton, corresponding to each primary assembly. Then 
came intermediate or secondary instruction, intended, if not 
for all, at least for the greater number, and given in the 
principal town of the district, or arrondissement. In the thiré 
place, special schools, scattered over the territory of the 
kingdom, in the principal towns of the departments, prepare 
young men for the different professions. Finally, the select 
intelligences find at Paris, in the National Institute, all that 
constitutes the higher instruction. 
The great novelty of this system was the creation of car 
tonal schools, open to peasants and to workmen, to those 
whom, up to this time, improvidence or the purpose. of the 
great sent off to their plows or to their planes. 
426. Graturry or Primary Instruction. — Talleyrand dié 
not desire compulsory education any more than Mirabeaa’
-P-A-G-E-409
THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. * 8i7. 
but, in accordance with the constitution of 1791, he demands 
the gratuity of primary instruction. Society is under obli+ 
gations to give elementary instruction, but not intermediate 
and secondary instruction, and still less, special and higher 
instruction. Gratuitous for the lowest grade, and in case 
of that elementary knowledge which constitutes for every 
civilized man a real moral necessity, instruction ought not 
to be free to young men who aspire to a liberal profession, 
because they have leisure, and who have leisure because they 
have wealth. However, Talleyrand admits exceptions in the 
ease of talent. By the creation of national scholarships, 
the doors of all the schools will be opened to select intelli- 
gences whom the lowness of their condition would condemn 
to remain obscure and unappreciated, did not society lend.te 
them a helping hand. 
427. Programme of Primary Instruction. — Primary 
instruction should comprise the principles of the national 
language, the elementary rules of calculation and mensura- 
tion; the elements of religion, the principles of morals, the 
principles of the constitution; finally, the development of 
the physical, intellectual, and moral powers. 
428. Means or Insrrocrion. — We shall not insist on ‘the 
details of the organization of the different parts of that 
which Talleyrand himself called his ‘‘ immense machine.” 
Let us notice only the last part of his work, where he dis- 
eusses a-certain. number of general questions under this 
arbitrary and unjustifiable title: Des moyens @instruction. 
The professors, carefully chosen, shall be elected by the 
king. Talleyrand does not determine that they shall be 
hremovable, but he requires that their situation shall be 
surrounded by all possible guarantees. _ Prizes, and rewards 
of every kind, shall encourage the teachers of youth to re

378 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
double their zeal and to find new methods.” Talleyrand 
counts on dramatic representations and on national holidays 
to hasten the progress of instruction. Finally, let it be 
added that he entrusts the supreme direction of public in- 
struction to six commissioners, chosen by the king and 
obliged to make an annual report. 
429. Tue Epucation or Women. — Talleyrand, in his 
proposal, has not wholly forgotten women, and what he has 
said of them is just and sensible. He discusses the question 
of their political rights, and, in accord with tradition and 
good sense, he concludes that the happiness of women, their 
own interests, their nature and their proper destination, 
ought to forbid them from entering the political arena. 
What is particularly fit for them is a domestic education, 
which, received in the family, prepares them for living there. 
Like Mirabeau, he wishes woman to remain a woman. Her 
function, said the great orator, is to perpetuate the species, 
‘to watch with solicitude over the perilous periods of early 
youth, and “to enchain to her feet all the energies of the 
husband by the irresistible power of her weakness.” With- 
out being as gallant in his expressions, Talleyrand’s thought 
is the same. He thought it necessary, however, in order to 
respond to certain proprieties, that the State should estab- 
lish institutions of public education destined to replace the 
convents. 
This desire sets right whatever was unreasonable in this 
passage of his proposed law : — 
_ Girls shall not be admitted to the primary schools after 
the age of eight. After that age the National Assembly 
advises parents to entrust the education of their daughters 
only to.themselves, and reminds them that this is their first 
duty.”.

430. Tae Lxeisnative Assempty anp Conporcer. — Ot 
all the educational undertakings of the Revolution, the most. 
remarkable is that of Condorcet. His Rapport presented to 
the Legislative Assembly, in behalf of the committee on 
public instruction, April 20 and 21, 1792, reprinted in 1793 
by order of the Convention, did not directly have the honor 
of a public discussion ; but it contained principles and solu- 
tions which are found in the deliberations and legislative 
acts of his successors. It remained, during the whole dura- 
tion of the Convention, the widely accessible source whence 
the legislators of that time, like Romme, Bouquier, and Lak- 
anal, drew their inspiration. gee Lt Look 
431. Conporcer (17438-1794). — Condorcet was admira- 
bly qualified for the task which the Legislative Assembly 
imposed on him, in charging him with the organization of 
public instruction. During the first years of the Revolution 
he had employed his leisure (he was not a member of the 
Constituent Assembly) in writing five Mémoires on instruc- 
tion, which appeared in a periodical called the Bibliotheque 
deVhomme public. The Rapport which he submitted to the 
Assembly was a sort of résumé of his long reflections. Con- 
dorcet brought to this work, not the indiscreet imagination 
of an improvised educator, but the authority of a competent 
thinker, who, if he had no personal experience in teaching, 
had at least reflected much on these topics and was con- 
scious of all their difficulties. Besides, he devoted himself 
te his work with the ardor of an enthusiastic nature, and 
with the serious convictions of a mind that had carried 
farther than any one else the religion of progress and zeal 
for the public good. 
482. Generat Consiwerations upon Insrrucrion. — All 
the Revolutionists have sung the praises of instruction, of
-P-A-G-E-412

which they were the passionate admirers. ‘Condorcet 1s ita 
reflective partisan, He did not love it more than the others, 
but he comprehended it better, and better stated why it 
should be loved. He first takes up the ideas of Talleyrand, 
and shows that without instruction, liberty and equality 
would be chimeras : — 
‘© A free constitution which should not be correspondent 
to the universal instruction of citizens, would come to destruc- 
tion after a few conflicts, and would degenerate into one of 
those forms of government which cannot preserve the peace 
among an ignorant and corrupt people.” 
Anarchy or despotism, such is the future of peoples who 
have become free before having been enlightened. 
' As to equality, without falling into the chimeras of an in- 
struction which should be the same for all, and which should 
reduce all men to the same level, Condorcet desires to realize 
it so far as it is possible. He desires that the poorest and 
the humblest shall be sufficiently instructed to belong to him- 
self, and not to be at the mercy of the first charlatan who 
comes along, and also to be able to fulfill his civil duties, te 
be an elector, a juror, etc. : 
433. Instrucrion anp Morarrry.— The instrument of 
liberty and equality, instruction, in the opinion of Condorcet, 
is, in addition, the real source of public morality and of 
human progress. If if were not correspondent to . the 
advances in knowledge, a free and impartial constitution 
would be hostile rather than favorable to good morals. 
«Instruction alone can give the assurance that the princi- 
ple of justice which the equality of rights ordains, shall not be 
in contradiction with this other principle, which prescribes 
that only those rights shall be accorded to men which they 
tan exercise without danger to society.”
-P-A-G-E-413
"THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. « 881 
But it is moral reasons still more than political motives. 
that make instruction the condition of virtue. Condorcet 
has shrewdly seen that the vices of the people come chiefly 
from their intellectual impotency. 
“ These vices come,” he says, ‘‘ from the need of escaping 
from ennué in moments of leisure, and in escaping from it 
through sensations and not trough ideas.” 
These are notable words which should never be lost sight 
of by the teachers and moralists of the people. 
To cause gross natures to pass from the life of the senses 
to the intellectual life; to make study agreeable to the end 
that the higher pleasures of the spirit may struggle success- 
fully against the appetites for material pleasures; to put 
the book in the place of the wine bottle; to substitute the 
library for the saloon; in a word, to replace sensation by idea, 
—such is the fundamental problem of popular education. 
434, InstrucTION AND PRocress. — Condoreet was a 
fanatic on the subject of progress. : Up to the last moment 
of his life he dreamed of progress, its conditions, and its 
laws. Now the most potent means of hastening progress is 
to instruct men; and here is the final reason why instruction 
is so dear to him. 
These are grand words : — 
“If the indefinite improvement of our species is, as I be- 
lieve, a general law of nature, man ought no longer to regard 
himself as a being limited to a transitory and isolated exis- 
tence, destined to vanish after an alternative of happiness or 
of misery for himself, and of good and evil for those whom 
chance has placed near him; but he becomes an active part 
of the grand whole, and a fellow-laborer in a work. that is 
eternal. In an-existence of a moment, and upon a point in 
space, he’ can, by his works, compass all places, relate him-

self to all the centuries, and continue ‘to act long centuries 
after his memory has disappeared front the earth.” And 
further on: ‘For a long time I have considered these views 
as dreams which were to be realized only in an indefinite 
future, and for a world where I should not exist. A happy 
event has suddenly opened an immense career to the hopes 
of the human race; a single instant has put a century of dis- 
tance between the man of to-day and him of to-morrow.” 
_ 435. Ta Liseratiry ov Convorcer. — Wrongly credited 
with a despotic and absolute habit of mind, Condorcet is, on 
the contrary, full of scruples and penetrated with respect as 
regards the liberty of individual opinions. In fact, he care- 
fully distinguishes instruction from education. Instruction 
has to do with positive and certain knowledge, the truths of 
fact and of calculation; education, with political and religious 
beliefs. Now, if the State is the natural dispenser of instruc: 
tion, it ought, on the contrary, in the matter of education, to 
forbear, and to declare itself iricompetent. In other words, 
the State ought not to abuse its power by imposing by force 
on its citizens such or such a religious Credo, such or such 
a political dogma. 
‘Public authority cannot establish a body of doctrine 
which is to be exclusively taught. No public power ought 
to have the authority, or even the permission, to prevent the 
development of new truths, or the teaching of theories cor 
trary to its particular policy or to its momentary interests.” 
436. Five Grapzs or Instruction. — Condorcet distis 
guishes five grades of instruction : 1. Primary schools proper 
2. Secondary schools, that is, such as we now call highe 
primary schools; 3. Institutes, or colleges of secondary ir 
struction; 4. Lycées, or institutions of higher instructiogi 
5. The National Society of Sciences and Arts, which corr 
sponds te our Institute.
-P-A-G-E-415
THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. » 383. 
Two things are especially to be noted: first,, Condoreet 
establishes for the first time higher primary schools, and de- 
mands one for each district, and in addition one for each town 
of four thousand inhabitants ; then, for primary schools proper, 
he takes the population as a basis for their establishment, and 
requires one for each four hundred inhabitanta.' 
437. Purvoss anp Pian of Primary Insravcrion. —- 
Condorcet has admirably defined the purpose of ‘primary in- 
struction :— 
‘In the primary schools there is taught that which is 
necessary for each individual in order to direct his own con- 
duct and to enjoy the plenitude of his own rights.” 
The programme comprised reading, writing, some notions 
on grammar, the rules of arithmetic, simple methods of 
measuring a field and a building with exactness; a simple 
description of the productions of the country, of the processes 
in agriculture and the arts; the development of the first 
moral ideas and. the rules for conduct derived from them ; 
finally, such of the principles of social order as can be put 
within the comprehension of children. 
438. Tax Ipea or Courses ror Apvuits. — Condorcet - 
was strongly impressed with the necessity of continuing the 
instruction of the workman and of the Peasant 8 after with- 
drawal from school :— 
  
1 Public instruction as now organized in France is of three grades, as 
follows: — 
“Primary instruction, which gives the elements of knowledge, reading; 
writing, and arithmetic. Secondary instruction, embracing the study of 
the ancient languages, of rhetoric, and the first elements of.the mathemati- 
cal and physical sciences, and of philosophy. This is given in the lycées ° 
snd colleges, as well as in the smaller seminaries. Supérior instruction, 
designed to teach in all their completeness letters, the languages, the sci- 
ences, and phiiesophy. This is given in the Faculties, in the College of © 
France, and in the larger seminaries”’—LrrtR&. (P.) .
-P-A-G-E-416
884 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
‘We have observed that instruction ought not to abandon 
individuals the moment they leave ‘the schools ; that it ought 
to embrace all ages; that there is no period of life when it is 
aot useful and possible to learn, and that this supplementary 
instruction is so much the more necessary as that of infancy 
4as been contracted to the narrowest limits. Here is one 
vf the principal causes of the ignorazce in which the poor 
cigsses of society are to-day plunged; they lacked not nearly 
so much the possibility of receiving an elementary instruction 
as that of preserving its advantages.” 
Consequently, Condorcet proposed, if not courses of in- 
struction for adults, at least something very like them, — 
weekly lectures, given each Sunday by the village teachers, 
a kind of lay sermons. . : 
‘*Each Sunday the teacher shall give a public lecture 
which citizens of all ages will attend. In this arrangement 
we have seen a means of giving to young people those neces- 
sary parts of knowledge, which, however, did not form a part 
of their primary education.” 
439. ProressionaL anp TecunicaL Epvcarion. — But 
Condorcut does not think his duty to the people done when 
he ‘has. given them intellectual emancipation. He is very 
anxious tu give in addition to the sons of peasants or work- 
men the ineans of struggling against- misery, by diffusing 
more and wore among the masses of the people a technical 
knowledge of the arts and trades.’ He deserves to be 
eounted among the adepts in professional instruction and in 
industrial education. He asks that there be placed in the 
schools ** models of machines or of trades”’ ; and in all grades 
of instruction, he recommends with a special solicitude the 
teaching of the practical arts. 
We fancy we are doing something new to-day when we 
establish school museums. “‘‘ Each school,” says Condorcet,
-P-A-G-E-417
THE FRENCH REVOLUTION: ~ 386: 
“shall have a small library, and a small cabinet in which) 
shall be placed some meteorological instruments or, some: 
specimens of natural history.”’. vet 
440. Tae Epucation or Women. — Condorcet may bé 
regarded as one of the most ardent apostlés of the education’ 
of women. He wishes education to be common and equal.” 
He is evidently wrong when he dreams of a perfect identity 
of instruction-for the two sexes, when he forgets the partic- 
ular déstination of women, and the special character of their 
education. But we have found so many educators disposed 
to depreciate the abilities of woman, that we are happy ‘to 
find at last one voice that exalts them, even beyond 
measure. : 
Lat us recall, however, the excellent reasons which he 
gives in support of his thesis on the equality of ‘education. 
It is necessary that women should be instructed: 1. in order 
that they may be able to bring up their children, of whom 
they are the natural instructors; 2. in order that they may 
be the worthy companions, the equals of their husbands, that 
they may feel an interest in their pursuits, share in their 
préoccupations, and, finally, participate in ‘their life, such 
being the condition of conjugal happiness; 3. in order, 
further, by an analogous reason, that they may not quench, 
by their ignorance, that inspiration of heart and mind which 
previous studies have developed in their husbands, but that 
they may nourish this flame by conversation and reading in 
common; 4. finally, because this is just, -— because the two 
sexes have an equal right to instruction. - 
441. RESERVATIONS TO BE MADE. — All is not equally 
worthy of commendation in the work of Condorcet. Some 
faults and some omissions mar this fine piece of political 
pedagogy. The faults are, first, the exaggerated idea of lib-
-P-A-G-E-418
386 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
erty and of equality. From Condorcet’s ardore for liberty there 
issues, in his plan for education, a grave error, — the idea of 
making of the teaching body a sort of State within the State, 
an independent authority, a fourth power, released from all 
exterior authority, governing itself and administering its 
own affairs, the State intervening only as treasurer to pay for 
the services which it neither regulates nor supervises. The 
liberal Daunou, while explaining the system of our author, 
has criticised it on this point.?_ ‘* Condorcet,” he said, ‘‘ the 
enemy of corporations, has sanctioned one in his scheme of 
national instruction ; he established, as it were, an academic 
church. This is because Condorcet, the enemy of kings, 
would add in the balance of public powers one counter- 
balance more to that royal power whose monstrous existence, 
in.a free constitution, is sufficiently attested by the alarms 
and fears of all the friends of liberty.” 
The passion for equality led Condorcet into another chimera, 
—that of the absolute gratuity of instruction of all grades. 
Finally, in his dreams of infinite perfectibility, Condorcet 
allows himself to be carried so far away as to imagine for 
tan, and to expect from instruction, results that are utterly 
unattainable. Instruction, according to him, ought to be so 
complete ‘as to cause the disappearance of every inequality 
which induces dependence.” 
442. Presopices or THE Marnematician. — From another 
point of view; Condorcet was led astray by his predilection 
for the sciences. He so far forgot that he was a member of 
the French Academy as to obey only his tendencies, a little 
too exclusive, as a mathematician and a member of the 
Academy of Sciences. By a reaction, natural enough, 
against those long centuries in which an abuse was made of 
  1. See the Rapport ot Daunon presented to the National Convention, 21 
Vendémiaire, year IV.
-P-A-G-E-419
‘THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 887 
literary culture, .Condorcet is too prompt to underrate ‘the 
influence of letters in education, and to invest the sciences 
with the place of honor. The reasons which he invokes to 
justify his preference are not all conclusive. 
. Omissions. — The idea of obligatory instruction is 
still wanting in the scheme we are examining. We shall be 
surprised, perhaps, that Condorcet, who has so clearly pro- - 
claimed the necessity of universal instruction, did not think 
to impose obligatory attendance, which is the only means of 
establishing it. ‘This is because the early revolutionists, in 
the ardor of their enthusiasm, did not suspect the opposition 
to the accomplishment of their plans that was to come from . 
the indifference of the greater number, and from the preju- 
dices of those who, as Condorcet has eloquently said, 
“thought they were obeying God while betraying their coun- 
try.” Té seemed to them that when centres of light had 
been made to glow over the whole surface of the country, 
citizens -would hasten after them, impelled by a natural 
appetite, spontaneously thirsting for enlightenment. They 
were deceived. These hopes, a little artless, were destined 
to be disproved by facts; and it was to triumph over the 
neglect of somé, and the resistance of others, that the Con- 
vention, ‘supplying one of the rare defects in Condorcet’s 
plan, decreed, on several occasions, instruction ‘‘ imperative 
and forced,” as was then said. 
On still another: point, Condorcet remained inferior to hia 
successors ; in his report there was no mention made of the 
organization of normal schools. In this grave and funda- 
mental question. of the education of the teaching body, 
Condorcet ‘contented himself with a provisional expedient, 
which consisted in entrusting to the professors of the grade 
_ immediately higher the care of preparing teachers for the 
: grade lower.
-P-A-G-E-420
388 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
’ 444, Finat Conciuston. — But even with these reserva- 
tions, the work of Condorcet deserves scarcely anything but 
praise. We have commended its new and exalted concep- 
tions. Its beautiful and exact arrangement and its masterly 
style also deserve praise. Condorcet’s periods are symmetri- 
cal in their fullness, and the expression is precise and vigor- 
ous. Doubtless there is some monotony and some frigidity 
in that style so concise and strong. But at intervals there 
are outbursts of passion. The man whom his contempora- 
ries compared to ‘‘an enraged lamb,” or to a ‘ voleano 
covered with snow,” is painted to the life in his writings. 
His Rapport is like a beautiful and finished statue of marble, 
cold to the touch, but upon which the hand might feel beat- 
ing in places a vein warm with life. 
(445. Anatyrica, Summary. —.1. The more important 
lessons to be derived from this study are the following: the 
necessity of making instruction universal and of having it 
administered by the State; the need of making instruction 
obligatory, and, in certain grades, gratuitous; the value of 
intellectual culture as a moral safeguard. 
2. The right of the State to self-preservation carries with 
. it the right to ordain the establishment of schools for giving | 
a certain kind and degree of instruction. This constitutes 
the first form of compulsion. 
3. When there is not a voluntary and general attendance 
on the schools ordained by the State, it may avail itself of 
the supplementary right to’ make attendance -obligatory. 
This constitutes the second form of compulsion. 
4. Gratuity is the logical sequence to compulsion. If the 
State may require all children to partake of a certain degree 
of instruction, it must make such instruction free. 
_§. Should instruction that is above the compulsory grade 
be free? This depends on the question whether the State
-P-A-G-E-421
THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 389 
needs a certain amount of the higher culture, and whether: - 
’ this required amount will be secured at the pupils’ own ex- 
pense. Monsieur Compayré decides, as against Condorcet 
(paragraph 441), that the higher grades of instruction 
should not be gratuitous. In. this country the prevailing 
theory is that the higher education should be endowed by 
the State. . 
6. The relation of instruction to morality has never been - 
more justly and pointedly stated than in paragraph 433. 
This is not only good sense but sound philosophy.]

446. Tue Convention. — The Constituent Assembly and 
the Legislative Assembly had done nothing more than to 
prepare reports and projected decrees, without either dis- 
cussing them or bringing them to a vote. The Convention 
went so far as to vote, but it did not have the time to exe- 
cute the resolutions, contradictory and incoherent, which it

December 12, 1792; and they appeared again in the bill of 
Sieyés, Daunou, and Lakanal, presented June 26, 1793, 
and defeated after an exciting discussion. But the influence 
of the Girondists was succeeded by the domination of the 
Montagnards! whose dictatorial and violent spirit is indi- 
cated: 1. in the bill of Lepelletier, adopted through the 
support of Robespierre, August 18, 1798; 2. in the bill 
projected and presented by Romme in behalf of the commis- 
sion of public instruction, October 20, 1793, and passed on 
the following day; 3. and lastly in the bill of Bouquier, 
which, presented December 19, 1793, became the decree of 
December 26. The reaction which followed resulted in the 
legislative acts by which the Convention finished its 
educational work. The bill of Sieyés, Daunou, and Laka- 
nal was reconsidered, and November 17, 1798, it was substi- 
tated for the bill of Bouquier. Finally, when the constitution 
of 1794 was substituted for the constitution of 1793, a new 
law of public instruction was passed on the report of Daunou, | 
October 27, 1795, and itis this law which presided over 
the organization of schools under the Directory.

instrtction, which the Convention had. ‘appointed October 2, 
1792, decided to put aside, for the present, the other branches 
of public instruction, and proposed for immediate. action 
only the. organization of primary schools, by taking, as a 
point of departure, the bill which Condoreet had presented 
to the Legislative Assembly. The report of Lanthenas and 
& proposed decree were within a few weeks the results of 
‘these deliberations ; but in all its parts this result is scarcely 
more than thé reproduction of Condorcet’s work, and presents 
nothing original. Let us note, however, the idea of as- 
sociating the pupil with his teacher in the work of instruc- 
tion :— 
“Teachers will call to their aid the pupils whose intelligence 
shall have made the most rapid progress; and they will thus 
-be able, very easily, to give to four classes of pupils, in the | 
same session, all the attention needed for their progress. 
At the same time, the efforts made by the most competent 
to teach what they know to their schoolmates, will be much 
more instructive to themselves than the Jessons they receive 
from their masters.” 
Further, let us notice title III. of the proposed decree 
relative to the measures to be taken in order to make obli- 
gatory the use of the French language, and to abolish the 
patois, or particular idioms. The minimum salary of men 
teachers was fixed at six hundred francs. The appointment 
of teachers was entrusted to the heads of families, who were 
to. elect one from a list prepared by a “‘ commission of edu- 
cated persons” appointed by the Councils-General of the 
communes and the Directories of departments. 
448. Tse Bict or LantHenas.— The discussion of the bill 
of Lanthenas began on December 12, 1792, but only article 
first was carried, and the bill itself did not beecome'a law.  
-P-A-G-E-425
THE CONVENTION. -. .. 893 
On December.20, another member of the Convention, 
Romme, mathematician, deputy from Puy-de-Dome, read 
4 new report on public instruction. 
449. Tue But or Romme.—The bill of Lanthenas 
aimed at only the first grade of instruction, but the report of 
Romme embraced the four grades of. instruction, and was 
but little more than a reproduction of Condorcet’s work. 
But no legislative measure followed the reading of his bill, 
and up to the 30th of May, 1793, there is scarcely anything 
to be noted, as the educational work of the Convention, save 
the bill of Rabatid Saint-Etienne on public festivals, and the 
report of Arbogast on elementary books. 
450. NationaL Hoxipays. —It is difficult to form an 
idea of the importance which the men of this period attributed 
to the educational influence of nationa] holidays. At vari- 
ance on so many points, they all agree in thinking that the 
French people could be instructed and regenerated simply 
by establishing popular solemnities. 
“Tt is a kind of institution,” said Robespierre, ‘* which 
ought to be considered as an essential part of public educa- 
tion, — I mean national holidays.” 
Daunou also persisted in considering national holidays as 
the most certain and the most comprehensive means of pub- 
licinstruction. The decree passed at his request established 
seven national holidays: that of the. foundation of the 
Republic, of young men, of husbands, of thanksgiving, of 
agriculture, of liberty, of old men. 
451. Exemenrary Booxs.— An important point in the 
pedagogy of the Revolution was the attention given to the 
composition of elementary books. On several occasions 
the Convention put up for competition these modest works 
intended to aid parents or teachers in their task. It was one
-P-A-G-E-426

of the happiest thoughts of that period'to desire that there 
should be placed in the hands of parents ‘simple methods and 
well-arranged books which might teach them how to bring up 
their children. The difficulty of this kind of composition 
was understood, and so application was made to the most 
distinguished writers. Bernardin de Saint Pierre was em- 
ployed to edit the Elements of Morality. 
December 24, 1792, Arbogast had submitted to the Con- 
vention a proposed decree in which it was said : — 
‘It is only the superior men in a science, or in an art, 
those who have sounded all its depths, and have carried it to 
its farthest limits, who are capable of composing such ele- 
mentary treatises as are desirable.” 
452, DxcrEE or May 30, 1793. — The first decree of the 
Convention relative to primary schools was passed May 30, 
1793. But this laconic law contained nothing very new. 
Besides, it was forgotten in the storm which on the next 
day, May 31, swept away the Girondists, and gave to the 
Montagnards the political supremacy. 
458. LaxkanaL (1762-1845).— After the revolution of 
May 31, among the men who, in the committee on public in- 
struction and in the assembly itself, were occupied with the 
educational organization of France, we must assign the first 
place to Lakanal and Daunou. On June 26, 1793, three 
days after the adoption of the new constitution, Lakanal 
brought to the tribune the bill which he had drawn up in 
conjunction with Daunou and Sieyés. 
Lakanal is one of the purest and most remarkable charac- 
ters of the French Revolution.’ ‘‘Lakanal,” said Marat, to 
whom some one had denounced him, “‘ works too much to

Preface by Paul Bert. ‘

have the time to conspire.” Industrious and thoughtful, 
after having taught philosophy with the ‘+ Doctrinaires,” of 
whom he was the pupil, he became the first, after Condorcet, 
of the educators of the Revolution. ‘‘ His appearance,” says 
Paul Bert, ‘‘ has always particularly attracted me. It unites 
gentleness with force, energy with serenity. We feel that 
this austere citizen has never known any other passion than 
that of well-doing, and ‘has neither desired nor obtained any 
other reward than that of having done his duty. He despises 
violence of language, and hates that of acts; and so we do 
not find him, under the Empire, a baron like Jean-Bon Saint 
André, a minister like Fouché, or a senator like a whole herd.” 
454, Davunou (1761-1840). — At an early period in his 
fife, Daunou had taught philosophy in the colleges of the 
Oratorians, of whom he was a member. In 1789 he pub- 
lished in the Journal Encyclopédique, a plan of national 
education which was approved by the Oratory, and which 
he presented to the Constituent Assembly in 1790. In the 
Convention he took an active part in the work of the com- 
mittee on public instruction, and assisted in the preparation 
of Lakanal’s first bill. In the same year he published an 
Essay on Public Instruction. In the Council of the Five 
Hundred he was appointed to make a report on the organiza- 
tion of special schools: Under the Empire he accepted the 
management of the national archives. Under the Restora- 
tion he was appointed professor of history in the College of . 
’ France. Finally, after 1830, we find him once more in the 
Chamber of Deputies, giving proof of unusual energy and 
vitality, and presenting in opposition to the minister of pub- 
lie instruction, de Montalivet, a counter-bill, the principal 
aim of which was to lodge with the municipal authorities the 
administration of s¢hools, a power which the government 
wished to leave i the hands of the inspectors.

455. Tue Bit or LakaNnaL, Sreyis, anp Davnov. 
These are the principal provisions of this bill: a school for 
each thousand inhabitants; separate schools for girls and 
boys; the election of teachers entrusted to a board of in- 
speectors composed of three members, and located at the gov- 
ernment centre of each district; the general organization of 
methods, regulations, and school régime placed in the hands 
of a central commission sitting with the Corps Législatif, 
and placed under its authority ; an education which embraces 
the whole man, at once intellectual, physical, moral, and in- 
dustrial ; the first lessons in reading given to boys as to girls 
by a woman teacher; arithmetic, geometry, physics, and 
morals included in the programme of instruction; visits to 
hospitals, prisons, and workshops; finally, liberty granted te 
private initiative to found schools. 
“The law can put no veto on the right which all citizens 
have to open private courses and schools, free in all grades 
of instruction, and to direct them as shall seem to them 
best.” (Art. 61.) 
‘This was pushing liberality rather far. 
Another distinctive feature of this bill; which is not with- 
out value, is the respect shown the character and functions 
of the teacher. On public occasions the schoolmaster shall 
wear a medal with this inscription: He who instructs is a 
second father. The form is rather pretentious, but the sen- 
timent is good. Other articles do not merit the same com- 
mendation, particularly the one which established theatres in . 
each canton, in which men and women would take part in 
music and dancing. 
The bill of Lakanal, vigorously opposed. by a part of the 
Assembly, was not adopted. Under the leadership of Robes- 
pierre, the Convention gave preference to the dictatorial and 
violent measure of Lepelletier Saint-Fargeau.

THE CONVENTION. . 307. 
456. Lersciermer Sart-Farceau (1760-1793), —~ As- 
sassinated in 1793, Lepelletier Saint-Fargeau left among 
his: papers an educational bill which Robespierre took up,: 
and which he presented to the Assembly July. 13, 1793, on 
the occasion of the debate opened on the motion of Barrére. 
A month later the bill was passed by the Convention, but-be- 
fore being carried: into operation, the decree was revoked. 
The Assembly receded from the accomplishment of a reform: 
in which some good intentions could not atone for measures 
that, on the whole, were mischievous and tyrannical. 
457. His Scheme or Epucation.— The plan of Lepel- 
letier scarcely deserves the admiration which Michelet gives 
it, who salutes in this work the ‘‘ revolution of childhood,” and 
who declares that it is ‘‘ admirable in spirit, and in no respect 
chimerical.” An imitation with but little originality of the 
institutions of Lycurgus and the reveries of Plato, the plan 
of Lepelletier is scarcely more than an historical curiosity. - 
458. LzpELLETreR anp Conporcer. — Lepelletier accepted 
Condorcet’s plan in all that relates to secondary schools, insti- 
tutes, and lycées, that is to say, higher primary instruction, 
secondary instruction, and superior instruction. 
‘“T find,” he said, ‘‘in these three courses a plan which 
seems to me wisely conceived.” 
But Lepelletier follows only his own fancy in the concep- 
tion of those curious boarding-schools, little barracks for 
childhood, in which he confined all children by force, wrest- 
ing them from their parents, and placing at the expense of 
the State their moral training, as well as their material 
support. : 
459. OsLiGaToRY ATTENDANCE IN Boarpine-Scxoors.— © 
In education, Lepelletiér represents the doetrine of the 
Jacobins. In order ‘to make France republican, he would 
employ radical and absolute measures.
-P-A-G-E-430
398 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY, 
** Let'us ordain,” he says, ‘‘ that all children, girls as well 
as boys, girls from five to eleven, and boys from five to 
twelve, shall be educated in common, at the expense of the 
State, and shall receive, for six or seven years, the same 
education.” 
In order that there may be complete equality, their food, 
like their instruction, shall be the same; even more, their 
dress shall be identical. Does Lepelletier then desire, in his 
craze for equality, that girls shall be dressed like boys? 
460. Tue Cuitp BELONGS To THE ‘RePuBLIc.— The idea 
of Lepelletier is that the child is the property of the State, 
a chattel of the Republic. The State must make the child in 
its own image. 
‘In our system,” he says, ‘‘ the entire being of the child 
belongs to us; the material never leaves the mould.” And 
he adds, ‘* Whatever is to compose the Republic ought to be 
cast in the republican mould.” 
- Lepelletier imposes on all children, girls and boys, the 
same studies, — reading, writing, numbers, natural morality, 
domestic economy. This is almost the programme of Con- 
dorcet. But he adds to it manual labor. All children shall 
be employed in working the soil. If the college has not at 
its disposal enough land to cultivate, the children shall be 
taken out on the roads, there to pick up stones or to scatter 
them. Can we imagine, without smiling, a system of educa- 
tion, in which our future advocates and writers are to spend 
six years in transporting material upon the highways? 
“461. Asso.ute Gratorry. —'The colleges in which Lepel- 
letier sequesters and quarters all the children are to be abso.

462. Tar Rieuts or tHe Fairy. — Ley one takes 
but little account of the rights of the fandily. However, 
notice must be taken of that idea which Robespierre thought 
‘« sublime,””— the creation, at each college, of d {eotncll: of 
heads of families, entrusted with the oversight of teachers 
and their children. L 
463. Sarnt- Jusr. — Saint-Just, in his Institutions répub:. 
licaines, maintains opinions analogous to those of Lepelletier, ° 
He admits that the child belongs to his mother till the age of 
five; but from the age of five till death he belongs to the 
Republic. Till the age of sixteen boys are fed at the ex- 
pense of the State. It is true that their food is not expen- 
sive. It is composed of grapes, fruit, vegetables, milk-diet, 
bread, and water. Their dress is of cotton in all seasons. 
However, Saint-Just did not subject girls to the same régime. 
More liberal on this point than Lepelleticr, he would have 
them brought up at home. 
464, Tar Romme Law (Oct. 30, 1793).—Romme. was. 
one of the most active members of the committee on public 
instruction. He was the principal author of the bill which 
the Convention passed in October, 1798, the principal articles 
of whick were conceived as follows : — 
“ Art. 1. There are primary schools distributed through- 
out the Republic in proportion to the population. 
« Art. 2.. In these schools children receive their earliest 
physical, moral, and. intellectual education, the best adapted 
to develop in thent republican manners, love of country, and: 
taste for labor. 
“ Art. 3... Tey Jearn to speak, read, a and write the French | 
language. o

i “They are taught the acts of virtue which:most honor free 
_ men, and particularly the acts of the French Revolution most 
“fit to give them elevation of soul, and to make them worthy 
of liberty and equality. 
" «They acquire some notions of the geography of France, 
“* The knowledge of the rights and duties of the man and 
the citizen is brought within their comprehension through 
examples and their own experience. 
‘They are given the first notions of the natural objects 
that surround them, and of the natural action of the 
elements. 
“They have practice in the use of numbers, of the com- 
pass, the level, weights and measures, the lever, the pulley, 
_ gnd in the measurement of time. 
“They are often allowed to witness what is done in the 
fields and in workshops; and they take part in these em- 
ployments as far as their age permits.” 
But the bill of Romme was not put ‘in operation. The 
Convention presently decided on a revision of the decree it 
had passed, and the bill of Bouquier was substituted for the 
bill-of-Romme. . 
. 465. THs Bovquirr Law (Dec. 19, 1793). — Bouquier 
was a:man of letters, deputy from Dordogne, and belonged 
to the Jacobinic party. He spoke of his bill as follows : — 
. Tt is a simple and natural scheme, and one easy to exe- 
cute ; s plan which forever proscribes all idea of an academic 
body, of a scientific society, of an educational hierarchy ; a 
plan, finally, whose bases are the same as those of the con- 
stitution, liberty, equality, and simplicity.” 
‘The Bouquier bill was adopted December 19, and remained 
in force till it was superseded by the Lakanal law.. 
These are its principal provisions: —
-P-A-G-E-433
THE CONVENTION. : /° © 401 
' ¢ The right to teach is open to all.” -“ Citizens, men ‘arid - 
women, who would use the liberty to teach,‘shall be required 
to produce a certificate of citizenship and good morals, and 
to fulfill certain formalities.” ‘‘ They shall be designated as 
instituteurs and institutrices.” ‘They shall be placed ‘+ under 
the immediate supervision of the municipality, of parents, 
and of all the citizens.” ‘‘ They are forbidden to teach any- 
thing contrary to the laws and to republican morality.” On 
the other hand, parents are required to send their children to 
the primary schools. Parents who do not obey this. order 
are sentenced, for the first offence, to pay a fine equal toa. 
fourth of their school tax. In case of a second offence, the 
fine is to be doubled and the children to be suspended for ten 
years from their rights as citizens. Finally, young people: 
who, on leaving the primary schools, ‘‘ do not busy them- 
selves with the cultivation of the soil, shall be required. to 
learn a trade useful to society.” 
Enforced school attendance, and what is an entirely differ- 
ent thing, the obligation of citizens to work, were thus estab- 
lished by the Bouquier law. 
Let us add that the author of this bill, which, like so many 
others, was not executed, had strange notions on the sciences 
and on instruction. 
“The speculative sciences,” he says, ‘* detach from society 
the individuals who cultivate them. . . . Free nations have 
no need of speculative scholars, whose minds are constantly 
travelling over desert paths.” . 
Hence, no scientific instruction. The real schools, ‘ the 
noblest, the most useful, the most simple, are the meetings 
of committees. The Revolution, in establishing national. 
holidays, in creating popular associations and clubs, has 
placed in all quarters inexhaustible sources of. instruction. 
Then let us not go and substitute for this organization, as

simple and sublime as the people that creates it, an artificial 
organization, based on academic statutes which should no 
longer infect a regenerated nation.” 
466. Tue Laxanat Law (Nov. 17, 1794).—There still 
remained something of the spirit of Lepelletier in the Bouquier 
law, though the idea of an education in common had been 
abandoned ; but the Lakanal law openly breaks with the ten- 
dencies of Robespierre and his friends. 
The law which was passed November 17, 1794, upon the 
report of Lakanal, reproduced in its spirit and in its principal 
provisions the original bill which the influence of Robespierre 
had defeated. 
The following was the programme of instruction contained 
in this law. 
The instructor shall teach : — 
“‘1. Reading and writing; 2. the declaration of the 
rights of man and the constitution; 3. elementary lessons 
on republican morals; 4. the elements of the French lan- 
guage both spoken and written; 5. the rules of simple cal- 
culation and of surveying; 6. lessons on the principal 
phenomena and the most common productions of nature; 
there shall be taught a collection of heroic actions and songs 
of triumph.” . 
At the same time the bill required that the schools be 
divided into two sections, one for the girls and the other for 
the boys, and distributed in the proportion of one to each 
thousand inhabitants. . The teachers, nominated by the people 
and confirmed by a jury of instruction, are to receive salaries 
as follows: men, twelve hundred francs; women, one thou- 
sand francs. 
467. Pepacogicat Merrsops. — Lakanal had given much 
thought to pedagogical methods. It, is the interior of the 
school, not less than its exterior organization, that preoc

eupied his generons spirit. Like the most of his contem 
poraries, a partisan of Condillac’s doctrine, he believed that. 
the idea could not reach the understanding except. throngh 
the mediation of the senses. Consequently, he recommended 
the method which consists ‘‘ in first appealing to the eyes of 
pupils, .. . in creating the understanding through the senses, 
. ..in developing morals out of the sensibility, just as un- 
derstanding out of sensation.” This is an excellent method 
if we add to it a corrective, if we do not forget to excite the 
intelligence itself, and to make an appeal to the interior forces 
of the soul. 
468. Exementary Booxs. —A few. other quotations wil 
suffice to prove with what acuteness of pedagogic sense 
Lakanal was endowed.’ Very much interested in the com- 
position of works for popular instruction, he sharply distin- 
guished the elementary book, which brings knowledge within 
the reach of children, from the abridgment, which does no 
more than condense along work. ‘‘ The abridged,” he said, 
‘¢ is exactly opposed to the elementary.” - No one has better 
comprehended than he the difficulty of writing a treatise on 
morals for the use of children : — 
“It requires special genius. Simplicity in form and art 
less grace should there be mingled with accuracy of ideas; 
the art of reasoning ought never to be separated from that 
of interesting the imagination; such a work should be con- 
ceived by. a profound logician and executed by a man of 
feeling. There should be found in it, so to speak, the ana- 
lytical mind of Condillac and the soul of Fénelon.” 
469. Gzocrarny. —Lakanal has defined with the same 
exactness, the method to be followed in the teaching of 
geography. ‘First. let there. be shown,” he says, ‘im ttt

the commune forms a part; then a map of the department, 
and then a map of France; after which will come the map 
of Europe and of other parts of the world, and lastly a map 
of the world. 
470, Lerrers anp Sciences. — More just than Condorcet, 
Lakanal did not wish scientific culture to do prejudice to 
literary culture : — 
“For a long time we have neglected ‘the belles-lettres, 
and some men who wish to be considered profound regard 
this study as useless. It is letters, however, which open 
the intelligence to the light of reason, and the heart to 
impressions of sentiment. They substitute morality for 
interest, give pupils polish, exercise their judgment, make 
them more sensitive and at the same time more obedient to 
‘the laws, more capable of grand virtues.” 
» 471. Nucessrry or Norma Scuoors. — Lakanal’s highest 
‘title.to glory is that he has associated his name with the 
foundation of normal schools. The idea of establishing 
pedagogical seminaries was not absolutely new. A number 
of the friends of instruction, both in the seventeenth and in 
the eighteenth century,’ had seen that it would be useless to 
open schools, if good teachers had not been previously

trained ; but the Convention has the honor of:having for! the 
first time given practical effect to this vague. aspiration... 2. 
Deereed June 2, 1798, the foundation of normal schools 
was the object of a report by Lakanal on October 26, 1794. 
In a. style which was inferior to his ideas, and. which would 
have been more effective had it been simpler, Lakanal sets 
forth the necessity of teaching the teachers ‘themselves be- 
fore sending them to teach their pupils: — ° . 4 
*‘ Are there in France, are there in Europe, are. there i in 
the whole world, two or three hundred men (and we need 
more than this number) competent to teach: the useful arts 
and the necessary branches of knowledge, according. to 
methods which make minds more. acute, and ‘truths more 
clear, — methods which, while teaching you to know one 
thing, teach you to reason upon all things?: No, that number 
of men, however small it may appear, exists nowhere on the 
earth. Jt is necessary, then, that they be trained. In being 
the first to decree normal schools, you have resolved to create 
in advance a-very large number of teachers; capable of be- 
ing theexecutors of a plan whose purpose is the regenera- 
tion of the human. understanding, in a republic of twenty-five 
millions of men, all of whom democracy renders equal.” ” 
The term normal schools (from the Latin word norma, a

human knowledge,” the pupils of the Normal School of Paris 
were to go and repeat in all parts of the Republic the ‘‘ grand 
lectures” they had heard, and there form the nucleus of pro- 
vincial normal schools. And thus, says Lakanal with exag- 
geration, ‘‘ that fountain of enlightenment, so pure and so 
abundant, since it will proceed from the foremost men of the 
Republic of every class, poured out from reservoir to reser-

_ of science than towards the art of teaching.” Thus the 
experiment, which terminated May 6, 1795, did not fulfill 
the hopes that had been formed of it: the idea of establish- 
ing provincial normal schools was not carried out. But no 
matter ; a memorable example had been given, and the fruit- 
: ful principle of the establishment of normal schools had made 
’ a atart in actual practice.

Schools of, Lakanal resembled, trait for trait, the Institutes 
of Condorcet. And it must be confessed that here the imi- 
tation is not happy. Lakanal made the mistake of. berrow- 
ing from Condorcet the plan of these poorly defined establish- 
ments, in which the instruction was on too vast a scale, and 
the programmes too crowded, where the pupil, it seems, was 
to learn to discuss de omni re scibili. Condorcet went so far 
as to introduce into his Institutes a course of, lectures on mid- 
wifery! The Central Schools, in which the. instruction. was 
a medley of studies indiscreetly presented to an overdriven 
auditory, do honor neither to the Convention that organized 
them, nor to Condorcet who had traced the first sketch of 
them. 
4173, Posrrtve anp Practicat Sprerr. ~~ However; there 
was something correct in the idea which presided over the 
foundation of the Central Schools. We find this expressed in 
the Essays on Instruction, by the mathematician, Lacroix.* 
Lacroix calls attention to the fact that the progress of the 
sciences and the necessity of learning a great number of new 
things, impose on the educator the obligation to take some 
account of’ space; and, if I may so speak, of ‘clipping the 
wings of studies which, like Latin, had thus fat been’ the 
‘Unique and. exclusive object of instruction.

408 THE HISTORY OF PEPAGOGY. 
In the Central Schools, in fact, the classical languages 
held only the second place. Not only were the mathematical 
sciences, and those branches of knowledge: from which the 
pupil can derive the most immediate profit, associated with the 
classics, but the preference was given to them.. In the minds 
of those who organized these schools, the positive and prac- 
tical idea of success in life was substituted for the speculative 
and disinterested idea of mental development for its own sake. 
In reality, these two ideas ought to complete each other, 
and not to exclude each other. The ideal of education con- 
sists in finding a system which welcomes both. But in the 
Central Schools the first point of view absorbed the second. 
These establishments resembled the industrial schools of our 
day, but with this particular defect, that there was a deter- 
mination to include everything in them, and to give a place 
to new studies without wholly sacrificing the old. Let there 
be created colleges of practical and special instruction ; noth- 
ing can be better, for provision would thus be made for thé 
needs of modern society. But let no one force literary studies 
and the industrial arts to live together under the same roof. 
476. Great Founpations or THE Convention. —In the 
first years of its existence, the Convention had given its at- 
tention only to primary schools. It seemed as though teach- 
ing the illiterate to read was the one need of society. In the 
end the Convention rose above these narrow and exclusive 
views, and turned its attention towards secondary instruction 
and towards superior instruction. It is particularly by the 
establishment of several special schools for superior instruc- 
tion that the Convention gave proof of its versatility and 
intelligence. 
In quick succession it decreed and founded the Polytechnic 
School, under the name of the Central School of Public Works

(March 11, 1794) ; the Normal School (October 30, 1794)-; 
the School of Mars (June 1, 1794) ; the Conservatory of Axts 
and Trades (September 29, 1794). The next year it organ» 
ized the Bureau of Longitudes, and finally the National Insti 
tute. What a magnificent effort to repair the ruins which 
anarchy had made, or to supply the omissions which the old 
régime had patiently suffered! Of these multiplied creations 
the greater number remain and still flourish. 
477. Law or Octoper 27, 1795. — Those who ‘ask us to 
see in the decree of October 27, 1795, ‘the capital work of 
the Convention in the matter of instruction, the synthesis of 
all its previous labors and proposals, the most serious effort 
of the Revolution,”! evidently put forward a paradox. La- 
kanal and his friends would certainly have disavowed a law 
which cancels with a few strokes of the pen the grand revo- 
lutionary principles in the matter of education, — the. grata- 
ity, the obligation, and the universality of instruction. .__ 
The destinies of public instruction are allied to the fate of 
constitutions. To changes of policy there correspond, by i an 
inevitable recoil, analogous changes in the organization of in- 
struction. Out of the slightly retrograde constitution of 1 798 
there issued the educational legislation of 1794, of which it 
could be said that ‘‘ the spirit of reaction made itself j pain: 
fully felt in it.’” 
Daunou, who was the principal author of it, doubtless ‘had 
high competence i in questions of public instruction ; but with 
a secret connivance of bis own temperament he yielded. to the 
tendencies of the times. He voluntarily condescended to 
the timidities of a senile and worn-out Assembly, ‘which, 
having become impoverished by a series of suicides, had 
scarcely any superior minds left within it. ©... |

410 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
478. Inxsurricrency or Daunov’s' Scweme. — Nothing 
could be more defective than Daunow’s plan. The number 
of primary schools was reduced.. It is.no longer proposed 
to proportion them to the population. Daunou goes back to 
the cantonal schools of Talleyrand : ‘¢ There shall be estab- 
lished in each canton of the Republic one or more primary 
schools.” We are far from Condoreet, who required a school 
for each group of four hundred souls, and from Lakanal, who 
demanded one for each thousand inhabitants. On the other 
hand, teachers no longer receive a salary from the State. 
The State merely assures to them a place for a class-room 
and lodging, and also a garden! ‘‘ There shall likewise be fur- 
nished the teacher the garden which happens to lie near these 
premises.” There is no other remuneration save the annual 
tuition paid by each pupil to the teacher. At the same stroke 
the teacher was made the hireling of his pupils, and gratuity 
of instruction was abolished. Only the indigent pupils, o 
fourth of the whole number, could be exempted by the muni- 
cipal administration from the payment of school fees. Finally, 
the programme of studies was reduced to the humblest pro- 
portions: reading, writing, number, and‘ the elements of 
republican morality. : 
After so many noble and generous ambitions, after so 
many enthusiastic declarations in favor of the absolute gra- 
tuity of primary instruction, after so many praiseworthy 
efforts to raise the material and moral condition of teachers, 
and to cause instruction to circulate to the minutest fibres of 
the social tissue, the Convention terminated its work in a 
mean conception which thinned out the schools, which im- 
poverished the programmes, which plunged the teacher anew 
into a precarious state of existence, which put him anew at 
the mercy of his pupils, without, however, taking care to 
assure him of patronage, and which, for his sole compensa

tion in ease he had no pupils to instruct, guaranteed him the 
right to cultivate a garden, if, indeed, there should be one in- 
the neighborhood of thé school! Had the law of 1795 been 
in fact the educational will of the Convention, is it not true, - 
at least, that it is after the manner of those wills extorted by 
undue’ means, where a man by his final bequests recalls his 
former acts, and proves himself faithless to all the aspirations 
of his life? : . 
No, it is not from Daunou, but from Talleyrand, from 
Condorcet, and from Lakanal that we must seek the real 
educational thought of the Revolution. Doubtless the meas-. 
ure of Daunou had over all previous measures the advan- 
tages of being applied, and of not remaining a dead letter ; 
but the glory of the early Revolutionists should not be belit- 
tled by the fact that circumstances arrested the execution of 
their plans, and that a century was necessary in order that 
society might attain the ideal which they had conceived. 
They were the first to proclaim the right and the duty of each 
citizen to be instructed and enlightened. We are ceaselessly 
urged to admire the past and to respect the work of our 
fathers. We do not in the least object to this, but the Rev- 
olution itself also forms a part of that past, and we regret 
that the men who so eloquently preach the worship of tradi- 
tions and respect for ancestors, are precisely those who the 
most harshly disparage the efforts of the Revolution.

414 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
While awaiting the grand and fruitful impulsion of Pesta- 
lozzi, the history of pedagogy ought to mention at least the 
Pietists, ‘‘ whose educational establishments contributed to 
prepare the way for the new methods,” and after them, the 
Philanthropists, of whom Basedow is the most celebrated 
representative. 
481. Tue Pretists anp Francxe (1663-1727) .— Francke 
played nearly the same part in Germany that La Salle did in 
France. He founded two establishments at Halle, the Peda- 
gogium and the Orphan Asylum, which, in 1727, contained 
more than two thousand pupils. He belonged to the sect of 
Pietists, Lutherans who professed an austere morality, and, 
in conformity with the principles of his denomination, he 
made piety the supreme end of education. 
That which distinguishes and commends Francke, is his 
talent for organization. He was right in giving marked at- 
. tention to the material condition of schools and to neede¢ 
supplies of apparatus. The Peedagogium was installed in 1713 
in comfortable qaarters, and there were annexed to it » 
botanical garden, a museum of natural history, physical ap- 
paratus, a chemical and an anatomical laboratory, and a shop 
for the cutting and polishing of glass. 
After him his disciples, Niemeyer, Semler, and Hecker. 
continued his work, and, in certain respects, reformed it. 
They founded the first real schools of Germany. They kep‘ 
up the practical spirit, the professional pedagogy of their 
master, and assured the development of those educational’ 
establishments which still exist to-day under the name of 
the Institutions of Francke.

-fourided at Dessau a school which received the praise of the 
philosopher Kant, and of the clergyman Oberlin. He desig- 
nated it by a name which reflects his humanitarian intentions, 
the Philanthropinwm. In the methods which he employed in 
it he seems always to have had before his eyes the exclama- 
tion of Rousseau: ‘‘ Things, things! Too many words!” 
The intuitive method, or that of teaching by sight, was prac- ' 
tised in the school of Dessau. 
The principal work of Basedow, his Elementary Book, is 
scarcely more than the Orbis Pictus of Comenius recon- 
structed according to the principles of Rousseau. At Dessau, 
the pretence was made of teaching a language in six months. 
‘*Our methods,” says Basedow, ‘‘ make studies only one- 
third as long and thrice as agreeable.’’ An abuse was made 
of mechanical exercises. ‘The children, at the command of 
the master: Imitamini sartorem, — Imitamini sutorem, — all 
began to imitate the motions of a tailor who is sewing, or of 
‘a shoemaker who is using his awl. Graver still, Basedow 
made such an abuse of object lessons as to represent to chil- 
Gren certain scenes within the sick-chamber, for the pur- 
pose of teaching them their duties and obligations to their 
mothers.!

Nevertheless, the results:were. still very:poor, and the.pub- 
lic school, especially the vibage school, remained in a sorry 
condition. 
‘* Almost everywhere,” says Dittes, «there: were employed 
as teachers, domestics, corrupt artisans; discharged soldiers, 
degraded students, and, in general, persons of questionable 
morality and education. . ‘Their pay was mean, and their 
authority slight. Attendance at.school, generally very irreg- 
ular, was almost everywhere entirely suspended in summer. 
Many villages had no school, and scarcely anywhere was the 
school attended by all the children. ‘In many countries, most 
of the children, especially the girls, were wholly without in- 
struction. The people, especially. the peasantry, regarded 
the school as a burden. The clergy, it is true, always re- 
-garded themselves as the proprietors of the.school, but om

progress. The nobility was -bat little favorable, in general,

that a Suabian schoolmaster, who died in 1782, had inflicted 
during his experience ‘in teaching 911,527 canings, 124,010 
whippings, 10,235 boxes on the ear, and 1,115,800 thumps 
on the head. Moreover, he had made boys kneel 777 times 
on triangular sticks, had caused the fool’s cap to be worn

had used something like 3000 words of abuse. . . .”

484, Pssratozz1 (1746-1827). —In Switzerland, the bit- 
aation of. primary instruction was scarcely better. The 
teachers were, gathered up at hazard ; their pay was: wretched ; 3 
in general they had -no lodgings of their own, and’ they were 
obliged to hire themselves out for domestic service among the 
well-off inhabitants of the villages, in order to find food and 
lodging among them. . A mean spirit of caste still dominated 
instruction, and: the poor remained sunk in ignorance. 
Tt was:in the very midst of this wretched and unpropitious 
state of affairs that there appeared, towards thé end.of the 
eighteenth-century, the most celebrated of modern educators, 
a man. who, we may be sure, was not exempt from faults, 
whose mind had deficiencies and weaknesses, and whom we 
have no intention of shielding from criticism, by ‘covering 
him with the praises of a superstitious admiration; but who 
is pre-eminently great by reason of his unquenchable love for 
the people, his ardent self-sacrifice, and his pedagogicinstinct. 
During the eighty years of his troubled life, Pestalozzi never 
ceased to: work for children, and to devote -himaclf to their 
instruction. War or the ill-will of his countrymen destroyed 
his schools to no purpose. Without ever despairing, he _ 
straightway rebuilt them farther away, sometimes. sneceed- 
ing, through the gift of ardent speech, which never deserted: 
him, in communicating the inspiration to those about him; 
gathering up in all places orphans and vagabonds, like a kid- 
napper of a new species ; forgetting that he-was poor, when 
he saw an occasion to be charitable, and that he was ill; when 
it was necessary to teach; and, finally, pursuing with an un- 
conquerable ‘enérgy, through hindrances and obstacles of, 
every description, his educational apostleship. ‘‘It is death 
or success!” he wrote. ‘‘ My zeal to accomplish the dream 
‘of my life would have carried me through air or through fire, . 
no matter how, to the highest peak of the Alps!”

418 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
485. Tue Epucarion or Pxsrarozzi. +The life of Pes- 
talozzi is intimately related to his educational: work. To 
comprehend the educator, it is first necessary to have become 
acquainted with the man. 
Born at Zurich in 1746, Pestalozzi died at Brugg in Argo- 
via in 1827. This unfortunate great man always felt the 
effects of the sentimental and unpractical education giver 
him by his mother, who was left a widow with three children 
in 1751. He early formed the habit of feeling and of being 
touched with emotion, rather than of reasoning. and of reflect- 
ing. The laughing-stock of his companions, who made sport 
of his awkwardness, the little scholar of Zurich accustomed 
himself to live alone and to become a dreamer. Later, 
towards 1760, the student of the academy distinguished him- 
self by his political enthusiasm and his revolutionary daring. 
At that early period he had conceived a profound feeling for 
the miseries and the needs of the people, and he already pro- 
posed as the purpose of his life the healing of the diseases of 
society. At the same time there was developed in him an 
irresistible taste for a simple, frugal, and almost ascetic life. 
To restrain his desires had become the essential rule of his 
conduct, and, to put it in practice, he forced-himself to sleep 
on a plank, and to subsist on bread and vegetables. Life in 
the open air had an especial attraction for him. Each year 
he spent his vacations in the country at his grandfather’s, who 
was a minister at Hoengg. Omne malum ex urbe was his 
favorite thought. ° 
. 486, Prsratozzt an Acricuttunisr (1765-1775). —Pes- 
talozzi’s call to be a teacher’manifested itself at first only by 
some vague aspirations, of which it would be easy to find the 
trace in the short essays of his youth, and in the articles 
which He contributed in his twentieth year to a students’ 
journal published at: Zurich. After having tried bis hand
-P-A-G-E-449
PESTALOZZI. 419 
unsuccessfully at theology and law, he became an agrieul- * 
turist. When he established at Neuhof an agricultural en- 
terprise, he thought less of enriching himself than of raising 
the material condition of the Swiss peasantry by organizing 
new industries. But notwithstanding his good intent, and 
the assistance of the devoted woman whom he had married 
in 1769, Anna Schultess, Pestalozzi, more enterprising than 
skillful, failed in his industrial establishments. In.1775 he 
had exhausted his resources. It is then that he formed an 
heroic resolution which typifies his indisereet generosity. 
Poor, and scarcely more than able to support himself, he 
opened on his farm an asylum for poor children. 
487. How Pesratozzt BECAME AN Epucator. — The asy- 
lum for poor children at Neuhof (1775-1780) is, so to speak, 
the first step in the pedagogical career of Pestalozzi. The 
others will be the orphan asylum at Stanz (1798-1799), the 
primary schools at Burgdorf (1799), the institute at Burgdorf 
(1801-1804), and, finally, the institute at Yverdun (18035- 
1825). 
The first question that is raised when we study systems 
of education, is, how the authors of those systems became 
teachers. : 
The best, perhaps, are those who became such because of 
their great love for humanity, or because of their tender love 
for their children. Pestalozzi is of this class. It is because 
he has ardently dreamed from his youth of the moral amelio- 
ration of the people; and it is also because he has followed 
with a tender solicitude the first steps of his little son Jacob 
on life’s journey, that he became a great teacher.

his child, shows him intent on: applying the principles of 
Rousseau. At the age of eleven, Jacob, like Emile, did not 
yet know how to read or to write. Things before words, the 
intuition of sensible objects, few exercises in judgment, 
respect for the powers of the child, an equal anxiety to hus- 
band his liberty and to secure his obedience, the constant 
endeavor to diffuse joy and good humor over education, — 
such were the principal traits of the education which Pesta- 
lozzi gave his son, an education which was a real experiment 
in pedagogy, from which the pupil perhaps suffered some- 
what, but from which humanity was to derive profit. From 
this period Pestalozzi conceived some-of the ideas which be- 
came the principles of his method. The father had made the 
educator. One of the superiorities of Pestalozzi. over Rous- 
sean is, that he loved and educated his own child. 
489. Tue Asytum at Nevnor. — Madame de Staél was 
tight in saying that ‘‘we must consider Pestalozzi’s school 
as limited to childhood. The education which it gives is 
designed only for the common people.” And, in fact, the 
first and the last establishments of Pestalozzi were schools 
for small children. In the last years of his life, when he 
was obliged to leave the institute of Yverdun, he returned 
to Neubof, and there had constructed a school for poor 
children. 
The school at Neuhof was to be above all else, in Pesta- 
lozzi's thought, an experiment in moral and material regen- 
eration through labor, through order, and through instruction. 
Many exercises in language, singing, reading of the Bible, — 
such were the intellectual occupations. But the greater part 
of the time was devoted to agricultural labor, to the cultiva- 
tion of madder. . 
Notwithstanding his admirable devotion, Pestalozzi did not 
long succeed in his philanthropic plans. He had to contend
-P-A-G-E-451
PESTALOZZI.. ’ 421 
against the prejudices of parents, and the ingratitude of the 
children. Very often. the little beggars whom he had. gath- 
ered up waited only till they had received from him new 
clothing, and then ran away and resumed their vagabond 
life. Besides, he lacked resources.. He became poor, and 
fell more and more into. debt... His friends, who had aided 
him on the start, warned. him that he would die in a hospital 
or in a mad-house.. 
“For thirty years,” he says himself, ‘ “my life was a des- 
perate struggle against the most frightful poverty.... More 
than a thousand times I was obliged to go without dinner, 
and at noon, when even. the. poorest. were seated around a . 
table, I devoured, a morsel of. bread upon the highway... ; 
and all this that I might. minister to. the needs of the poor, 
by the realization of my principles.” 
490. Pgsrarozzy a Wrirer. — After the check to his un- 
dertaking at Neuhof, Pestalozzi renounced for some time all 
practical activity, and it was by his writings that he mani- 
fested, from 1780 to 1787, his zeal in education. 
In 1780 appeared the Evening Hours ofa Recluse, a series 
of aphorisms on the ‘rise of a people through education. In 
this, Pestalozzi sharply criticised the artificial method of the 
school, and insisted on the necessity of developing the soul 
through what is within, -- through interior éulture : — 
“The school everywhere puts the order of words before 
the order of freé-nature.”” * 
“The home is the basis of the education of humanity.” 
“Man, it is within yourself, it is in the inner sense of your 
power, that vorides nature’ 's instrument for your develop- 
ment.” :

In making Gertrude the principal.character of his romance, 
Pestalozzi wished to emphasize one of his fundamental ideas, 
which was to place the instruction and the education of the 
people in the hands of mothers,

educational tendency. . Also, in his Researches on the Course. 
of Nature in the Development of the Human Race, he sought 
to justify the preponderant office which he accorded to nature 
in the education of man. But Pestalozzi was not successful 
in philosophical dissertations. 
“This book,” he says himself, ‘+ is to me only another 
proof of my lack of ability; it is simply a diversion of my 
imaginative faculty, a work relatively weak.... No one,” 
he adds, *‘ understands me, and it has been hinted that the 
whole work has been taken Jor nonsense.” : 
This judgment is severe, but it is only just. Pestalozzi 
had an intuition of truth, but he was incapable of giving a 
theoretical demonstration of it. His thought all aglow, and 
his language all imagery, did not submit to the concise and 
methodical exposition of abstract truths. 
494. Tue Ornpuan Asytum ar Sranz (1798-1799). — 
Up to 1798 Pestalozzi had scarcely found the occasion to 
put in practice his principles and his dreams. The Helvetic 
Revolution, which he hailed with enthusiasm as the signal of 
a social regeneration for his country, finally gave him the 
meané of making a trial of his theories, which, by a strange 
destiny, had been applied by other hands before having been 
applied by his own. 
The Helvetic’ ‘ghvernment, whose sentiments were in har- 
mony with the dethocratic sentiments of Pestalozzi, offered 
him the direction of a normal school. But he declined, in 
order that he might remain a teacher. He was about to take 
charge of a school, the plan of which he had organized, when 
events called him to direct an orphan asylum at Stanz. 
495. Mernops roLtowEp at Sranz. — From six to eight 
o'clock in the morning, and from four to eight in the after- 
soon, Pestalozzi heard the lessons of his pupils. The rest
-P-A-G-E-454
424 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
of the time was devoted to manual labor, “Even during the 
lesson, the child at Stanz ‘‘ drew, wrote, and worked.’ To 
establish order in a school which contained eighty pupils, 
Pestalozzi had the idea of resorting to rhythm; ‘ and it was 
found,” he says, ‘‘ that the rhythmical pronunciation increased 
the impression produced by the lesson.” Having to do with 
pupils absolutely ignorant, he kept them for a long time on 
the elements; he practised them on the first elements till 
they had mastered them. He simplified the methods, and 
sought in each branch of instruction a point of departure 
adapted to the nascent faculties of the child. The mode of 
teaching was simultaneous. All the pupils repeated in a 
high tone of voice the words of the teacher ; but the instrac- 
tion was also mutual : — 
“¢Children instructed children; they themselves tried the 
experiment; all I did was to suggest it. Here again I obeyed 
necessity. Not having a single assistant, I had the idea of 
putting one of the most advanced pupils between two others 
who were less advanced.” 
Reading was combined with writing. Natural history and 
geography were taught to children under the form of con- 
versational lessons. 
But what engrossed Pestalozzi above all else was to 
develop the moral sentiments and the interior forces of the 
conscience. He wished to make himself loved by his pupils, 
to awaken among them, in their daily association, sentiments 
of fraternal affection, to excite the conception of each virtue 
before formulating its precept, and to give the children moral 
lessons through the influence of nature which surrounded 
them and through the activity which was imposed on them. 
Pestalozzi’s chimera, in the organization at Stanz, was to 
transport into the school the conditions of domestic life, — 
the desire to be a father to a hundred children.
-P-A-G-E-455

were my pleasures.” 
' “Twas everything tomy children. I was alone with them 
from morning till night. ... Their hands were in my hands. 
Their eyes were fixed on my eyes.” ‘ 
496. ResuLTs ACCOMPLISHED. — Without plan, without 
apparent order; merely by the action and incessant coms 
munication of his ardent: soul with children ignorant and 
perverted by misery; reduced to his own resources in a 
house where he was himself ‘‘ steward, accountant, footman, 
and almost servant all in one,” Pestalozzi obtained. surpris- 
ing results. 
“T saw at Stanz,” he says, “the power of the human 
faculties... . My pupils developed rapidly ; it was another 
race.... The children very soon felt that there existed in 
them forces which they did not know, and in particular they 
acquired a. general sentiment of order and beauty. They 
were self-conscious, and the impression of weariness which 
habitually reigns in schools vanished like a shadow from my 
class-room. They willed, they had power, they persevered, 
they succeeded, and they were happy. They were not 
scholars who. were learning, but children who felt unknown’ 
forees awakening within them, and who understood. where 
these forces could and would lead them, and this fecling 
gave elevation to their:mind and heart.” 
“Tt is out of the folly of Stanz,” says Roger de Guimpas

426 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
‘that has come the primary school of the ‘nineteenth cen- 
While the pupils prospered, the master fell sick of over- 
work. When the events of the war closed the orphan 
asylum, it was quite time for the health of Pestalozzi. He 
raised blood and was at the limit of his strength.’ 
497. Tae Scuoots or Bureporr (1799-1802).— As 
soon as he had recovered his health, Pestalozzi resumed the 
course of his experiments. Not without difficulty he sue- 
ceeded in having entrusted to him a small class in a primary 
school of Burgdorf. He passed for an ignoramus. 
“¢Tt-was whispered that I could neither write, nor compute, 
nor even read decently.” Pestalozzi does not defend him- 
self against the charge, but acknowledges his incapacity, @ and 
even asserts that it is to his advantage. 
_.**My incapacity in these respects was. certainly an indis- 
pensable condition for my discovery of the simplest: method 
of teaching.” 
. What troubled him most in the school at Burgdort “¢ was 
_ that it was subjected to rules.” ‘‘ Never in my life had I 
borne such a burden. I was discouraged. I cringed under 
the routine yoke of the school.” 
Nevertheless, Pestalozzi succeeded admirably in his little 
school. Then more advanced pupils were given him, but 
here his success was less. He always proceeded without a 
plan, and he gave himself great trouble in obtaining results 
that he might have attained much more easily with a little 
more system. Blunders, irregularities, and whimsicalities 
were ever compromising the action of his good will. To be 
convineed of this,. it suffices to read the books which he pub- 
lished at this period, and in particular the most celebrated, 
of which we shall proceed to give a brief -analysis..

' 498. How ‘Gerrrupe THACHES HER CHILDREN. —It’ is 
under this title that in 1801 Pestalozzi published an exposi+ 
tion of his doctrine.! ‘It is the most important and the 
most profound of all his pedagogical writings,” says one of 
his biographers. We shall not dispute this; but this book 
also proves how. the mind of Pestalozzi was inferior to his 
heart, how the writer.was of less worth than the teacher. 
Composed: under the form of letters addressed to Gessner, 
the work of Pestalozzi is too often a tissue of declamations, 
of rambling thoughts, and of personal grievances. It is the 
work of a brain that is in a state of ferment, and of a heart 
‘that is overflowing. The thought is painfully disentangied 
from out a thousand repetitions. Why need we be aston- 
ished at this literary incompetence of Pestalozzi when he 
himself makes the following confession: ‘‘ For thirty years 
Thad not read a single book ; I could not longer read them.” 
499. Pxstatozzi’s Strte. — The style of Pestalozzi is the 
very man himself: desultory, obscure, confused, but. with 
sudden flashes and brilliant illuminations in which the warmth 
of his heart is exhibited. .There are also too many compari- 
sons; the imagery overwhelms the idea. Within a few 
pages he will compare himself, in succession, ‘‘ to a sailor, 
who, having lost-his harpoon, would try to catch a whale 
with a.hook,” to depict the disproportion between his 
resources and his purpose; then to a straw, which even a 
cat would not lay -hold of, to tell how he was despised ; 
to an owl, to express his isolation; to a reed, to indicate 
his feebleness; to a mouse which fears a cat, to characterize 
his timidity.

es THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
500, AnaLysis or tHe Gerrrupk.-~It is mot easy to 
analyze one of Pestalozzi’s books. ‘To begin with, How 
Gertrude teaches her Children is a very bad title, for Gertrade 
is not once mentioned in it. This proper name became for 
Pestalozzi an allegorical term by which he’personifies himself. 
The first three letters are rather autobiographical memoirs 
than an exposition of doctrine. Pestalozzi here relates his 
first experiments, and makes us acquainted with. his assist- 
ants at Burgdorf, — Krisi, Tobler, and Bass. In the letters 
which follow, the author attempts to set forth the general 
principles of his method. The seventh treats of language ; 
the eighth, of the intuition of forms, of writing, and of 
drawing ; the ninth, of the intuition of ‘numbers and of com- 
putation; the tenth and twelfth, of intuition in general. 
For Pestalozzi, intuition was, as we know, direct and ex- 
perimental perception, either in the domain of sense, or in 
the interior regions of the consciousness. Finally, the last 
letters are devoted to moral and religious development. 
Without designing to follow, in all its ramblings and in all 
its digressions, the mobile thought of Pestalozzi, we shall 
gather up some of the. general ideas which abound in this 
overcharged and badly composed work. 
501. Mersops Smpimiep.— The purpose of Pestalozzi 
was indeed, in one sense, as he was told by one of his 
friends, to mechanize instruction. He wished, in fact, to 
simplify and determine methods to such a degree that they 
might be employed by the most ordinary teacher, and by the 
most ignorant father and mother. - In a’‘word, he hoped to 
organize a pedagogical machine so well set up that it could 
fn a manner run alone. 
“TI believe,” he says, ‘* that we must not dream of making 
progress in the instruction of the people as long as we have
-P-A-G-E-459
PESTALOZZI. 429 
not found: the forms of instruction ‘which make of ‘the 
teacher, at least so far as the completion of the elementary 
studies is concerned, the ‘simple mechanical instrument of a 
method which owes its results to the nature of its processes, 
and not to the ability of the one who uses it. I assert that 
a school-book has no value, save aa it can be employed by a 
master without instruction as well as by one who has been 
taught.” 
This was sheer exaggeration, and was putting too little 
value on the personal effort and merit of teachers. On this 
score, it would be useless to found normal schools. Pesta- 
lozzi, moreover, has given in his own person .a striking 
contradiction to this singular theory ; for he owed his ‘success 
in teaching much more to the influence of his living speech, 
and to the ardent communication of the passion by which his 
heart was animated, than to the methodical processes which 
he never succeeded in combining in an efficient manner. 
502. Tue “Sockanrc Mernop. — Pestalozzi recommends 
the Socratic method, and he indicates with exactness some of 
the conditions necessary for the employment of that method. 
He first observes that it requires on the part of the teacher 
uncommon ability: |. : - 
“A superficial. and uncultivated intelligence,” he says, 
“does not sound the depths whence a Socrates made spring 
up intelligende and trath.” 
Besides, the Socratic method can be employed only with 
pupils who already have some instruction. It is absolutely 
impracticable with children who lack both the point of de- 
parture, that is,‘ preliminary notions, and the means of 
expressing these notions, that is, a knowledge of language. 
And as it isialways necessary that Pestalozzi’s thought 
should wind ‘up with's figure of speech, he adds :—
-P-A-G-E-460
430 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
‘In order that the goshawk and the:eagle may plunder 
eggs from other birds, it is first necessary that the latter 
Should deposit eggs in their nests.”. : 
503. Worn, Form, anp Numper.— A favorite idea of 
Pestalozzi, which remained at Yverdun, as at Burgdorf, the 
principle of his exercises in teaching, is that all elemen- 
tary knowledge can and should be related to three princi- 
ples, — word, form, and number. To the word he attached 
language, to form, writing and drawing, and to number, 
‘computation. . 
“This was,” he says, “like a ray of light in my re- 
“searches,” like a Deus ea machina!” Nothing justifies such 
‘enthusiasm. It would be very easy to show that Pestalozzi’s 
‘classification, besides that it offers no practical interest, is 
‘not justifiable from the theoretical point of view, first be- 
‘cause one of the elements of his trilogy, the word, or lan- 
guage, comprises the other two; and then because a large 
part of knowledge, for example, all physical qualities, does not 
‘permit the distinction of which he was superstitiously fond. 
. 504. Inrurmrve Exercises. — What is of. more value is 
‘the importance which Pestalozzi ascribes to intuition. Ao 
incident worthy of note is that it is not Pestalozzi himself, 
but one of the children ‘of his school, who first had the ides 
-of: the direct observation of the objects which serve as the 
text for the lesson. One day as, according to his custom, he 
was giving his pupils a long description of what they 
-observed in a drawing where a window was represented, he 
-noticed that one of his little auditors, instead of looking at 
‘the; picture, was attentively studying the real window of the 
sehool-room. _— : 
i From that moment Pestalozzi put aside. all ‘his drawings, 
and took the ‘objects themselyes for subjects of ‘observation:
-P-A-G-E-461
’ PESTALOZZI. 431 
“The child,” he said, ‘wishes nothing to intervene be 
tween nature and himself.” 
Bamsauer, a pupil at Burgdorf, has described, not with- 
out some inaccuracy perhaps, the intuitive exercises which 
Pestalozzi offered to his pupils : — 
“The exercises in language were the best we had, espe- 
cially those which had reference to the wainscoting of the 
school-room. . He. spent whole hours before that wainscot- 
ing, very old‘ and torn, busy in examining the holes ‘and 
rents, with respect to number, form, position, and color, and 
in formulating our observations in sentences more or less de~ 
veloped. .'Then Pestalozzi would ask us, Boys, what do you 
see? (He.never mentioned the girls.) . 
Pupil: I see # hole in the wainscoting. 
Pestalozzt; Very well; repeat after me :— ~ 
T see a hole in the wainscoting. 
I see a large hole in the wainscoting. 
Through. the hole I see the wall, etc., ete.” 
505. Tae Boox ror Morners. — In 1803 Pestalozzi pub- 
lished a work on elementary instruction, which remained un- 
finished, entitled The Book for Mothers. ‘This was another 
Orbis Pictus without pictures. Pestalozzi’s intention was to 
introduce the child to a knowledge of the objects of nature 
or of art which fall under his observation. In this he tar- 
ried: too long. over:the description of the organs of the body 
and of their functions. A French critic, Dussault, said, 
with reference to. this : — 
“ Pestalozzi gives himself much trouble to teach children 
that their nose is in the middle of their face.” In his anxiety 
to be simple and. elementary, Pestalozzi often succeeds in 
reality in making instruction puerile. On the other hand, 
the Pére-Girard complains that the exercises in language
-P-A-G-E-462
432. THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
which compose The Book for Mothers, “ teally very weil ar- 
ranged, are also very dry and monotonous.” 
506. A Swiss Teacuer 1n 1793.—To form a just esti- 
wate of the efforts of Pestalozzi and his assistants, we must 
take into account the wretched state of instruction at the 
period when they attempted to reform the methods of teach- 
ing. Kriisi, Pestalozzi’s first assistant, one of those who 
were perhaps the nearest his heart, has:himself related how 
he became a teacher. He was eighteen, and till then his 
only employment had been that of a peddler for his father. 
One day, as he was going about his. business with a heavy 
load of merchandise on his shoulders, he meets on the road a 
revenue officer of the State, and they enter into conversation. 
“Do you know,” said the officer, “‘ that the teacher of Gais 
is about to leave his school? Would you not like to succeed 
him ?—TIt is not a question of what I would like; a school- 
master should have knowledge, in which I am absolutely lack- 
ing. — What a school-master can and should know with us, 
you might easily learn at your age.” — Krisi reflected, went 
to work, and copied more than a hundred times a specimen 
of writing which he had procured ; and he declares that this 
was his only preparation. He registered for examination. 
The day for the trial arrived. 
‘¢ There were but two competitors of us,” he says. ‘* The 
principal test consisted in writing the Lord’s Prayer, and to 
this I gave my closest attention. I had observed that in 
German, use was made of capital letters ; but I did not know 
the rule for their use, and tock them for ornaments. Sol 
distributed mine in a symmetrical manner, so that-some were 
found even in the middle of words. In faet, neither of us | 
knew anything. , ,

moned, and Captain Schepfer informed me that the exam- 
iners had found us both deficient; that my competitor read 
the better, but that I excelled him in writing; ... that, - 
besides, my apartment, being larger than that of the other 
vandidate, was better fitted for holding a school, and, finally, 
that I was elected to the vacant place.” . 
Is it not well to be indulgent to teachers whom we meet on 
she highway, who scarcely know how to write, and whom a 
vaptain commissions ? 
507. Tae Insrirore ar Borcporr (1802).— When Pes- 
talozzi published the Gertrude and The Book for Mothers, he 
was not simply a school-master at Burgdorf; he had taken 
charge of an institute, that is, of a boarding-school of higher 
vrimary instruction. There also he applied the natural 
wethod, ** which makes the child proceed from his own intui- 
tions, and leads him by degrees, and through his own efforts, 
to abstract ideas.” The institute succeeded. The pupils of 
Burgdorf were distinguished especially by their skill in draw- 
ing and in mental arithmetic. ‘Visitors were struck with their 
air of cheerfulness. Singing and gymnastics were held in 
honor, and also exercises on natural history, learned in. the 
open field, and during walks. Mildness and liberty charac- 
terized the internal management. “It is not a school that 
you have here,” said a visitor, ‘* but a family!” 
508. Journey TO Paris. —It was at this period that Pes- 
talozzi made a journey to Paris, as a member of the consulta 
called by Bonaparte to decide the fate of Switzerland. He 
hoped to take advantage of his stay in France to disseminate 
his pedagogical ideas. But Bonaparte refused to see him, 
saying that. he had something else to do besides discussing 
questions of a bc. Monge, the founder of the Polytechnic 
School, was inore cordial, and kindly listened to the explana- .

tions of the Swiss pedagogue: _ But he concluded by saying, 
+ Té is too much for us!’ More disdainful still, Talleyrand 
had said, ‘‘ It is too much for the people!” 
On the other hand, at the same period, the philosopher 
Maine de Biran, then sub-prefect at Bergerac, called a disciple 
of Pestalozzi, Barraud, to found schools in the department of 
Dordogne, and he encouraged with all his influence the appli- 
cation of the Pestalozzian method. 
509. Tue Insrirute ar Yverpoun (1805-1825).—In 1803 | 
Pestalozzi was obliged to leave the castle of Burgdorf. The 
Swiss government gave him in exchange the convent of 
Miinchen-Buchsee. Pestalozzi transferred his institute to 
this place, but only for a little time. In 1805 he established 
himself at Yverdun, at the foot of Lake Neufch4tel, in French 
. Switzerland; and here, with the aid of several of his col- 
leagues, he developed his methods anew, with brilliant success 
at first, but afterwards through all sorts of vicissitudes, diffi- 
culties, and miseries. 
The institute at Yverdun was rather a school of secondary 
instruction, devoted to the middle classes, than a primary 
school proper. Pupils poured in from all sides. The char- 
acter of the studies, however, was poorly defined, and Pesta- 
lozzi found himself somewhat out of his element in his new 
institution, since ke excelled only in elementary methods and 
jn the education of little children. 
510. Success or THE Instirure. — Numerous visitors be- 
took themselves to Yverdun, some through simple love of 
strolling. The institute of Yverdun made a part, so to speak, 
of the curiosities of Switzerland. People visited Pestalozzi 
as they went to see a lake or a glacier. As soon as notice 
was given of the arrival of a distinguished personage, Pesta- 
lozzi summoned one of his best masters, Ramsauer of 
Schmid.
-P-A-G-E-465
PESTALOZZI. 486 
«s Take your best pupils,” he said, ‘¢ and show the Prince 
what we are doing. He has numerous serfs, and when he is 
convinced, he will have them instructed.” 
These frequent exhibitions entailed a great loss of time. 
Disorder reigned in the instruction. The young masters 
whom Pestalozzi had attached to his fortunes were over- 
whelmed with work, and could not give sufficient attention te 
the preparation of their lessons. Pestalozzi was growing old, 
and did not succeed in completing his methods. 
511. Tax Tentatives or PrsTaLozzi.—The teaching of 
Pestalozzi was in reality but a long groping, an experiment 
ceaselessly renewed. Do not require of him articulate ideas, 
and methods definitely established. Always on the alert, and 
always in quest of something better, his admiradle pedagogic 
instinct never came to full satisfaction. His merit was that 
he was always on the search for truth. His theories almost 
always followed, rather than preceded, his experiments. A 
man of intuition rather than of reasoning, he acknowledges 
that he went forward without considering what he was doing. 
He had the merit of making many innovations, but he was 
wrong in taking counsel of no one but himself, and of his 
personal feelings. ‘‘ We ought to read nothing,” he said; 
Swe ought to discover everything.” Pestalozzi never knew 
aow to profit by the experience of others. 
He never arrived at complete precision in the establish- 
ment of his methods. He complained of not being under- 
stood, and he was not in fact. One of his pupils at Yverdun, 
Valliemin, thus-expresses himself : — 
“ That which was called, not without pretense, the method 
of Pestalozzi was an enigma for us. It was for our teachers 
themselves. - Each of them interpreted the doctrine of the 
master in: his own way; but we were still far from the time
-P-A-G-E-466
436 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
when these divergencies engendered: discord; when our 
principal teachers, after each had given out that he alone 
had comprehended Pestalozzi, ended by asserting that Pes- 
talozzi himself was not understood; that he had not been 
understood except by Schmid, said Schmid, and by Niederer, 
said Niederer.” 
512. Mernops at Yverpun.— The writer whom we have 
just quoted gives us valuable information on the methods 
which were in use at Yverdun : — 
‘¢ Instraction was addressed to the intelligence rather than 
to the memory. Attempt, said Pestalozzi to his colleagues, 
\ develop the child, and not to train him as one trains a 
\dog.”” 
reo Language was taught us by the aid of intuition; we 
learned to see correctly, and through this very process to 
‘form for ourselves a correct idea of the relations of things. 
What we had conceived clearly we had no difficulty in 
expressing clearly.” 
“The first elements of geography were taught us.on the 
‘ppot.... Then we reproduced in relief with clay the valley 
of which we had just made a study.” 
“We were made to invent geometry by having marked 
‘out for us the end to reach, and by being put on the route. 
The same course was followed in arithmetic; our computa- 
tions were made in the head and viva voce, without the aid 
of paper.” 
513. DecapENce or THE InstrruTE.—Yverdun enjoyed 
an extraordinary notoriety for some years. But little by 
little the faults of the method became apparent. Internal 
discords and the misunderstanding of Pestalozzi’s col- 
leagues, of Niederer, “‘ the philosopher .of the method,” and 
.of Schmid, the mathematician, hastened the decadence of
-P-A-G-E-467
PESTALOZZI. : 43y 
an establishment in which order and discipline had never 
reigned. Pestalozzi was content with being the spur of the 
institute. He became more and more unfit for practical 
affairs. He allowed all liberty to his assistants,.and also to 
his pupils. At Yverdun the pupils addressed their teachers 
in familigr style. The touching fiction of paternity trans- 
ported inte the school, which was successful with Pestalozzi 
in his first experience in teaching, and with a small number 
of pupils, was no longer practicable at Yverdun, with a mass 
of pupils of every age and of every disposition. , 
514. Jupement or Pitre Grrarp.—In 1809 the’ Pare 
Girard! was commissioned by the Swiss government to. 
inspect the institute. The result was not favorable, though 
Girard acknowledges that he conceived the idea of his own 
method from studying at first hand that of Pestalozzi. 
The principal criticism of Girard bears on the abuse of 
mathematics, which, under the influence of Schmid, became 
in fact more and more the principal occupation of teachers 
and pupils. , / 
“J made the remark,” he says, ‘“‘ to my old friend Pes- 
talozzi, that the mathematics exercised an unjustifiable sway 
in his establishment, and that I feared the results of this on 
the education that was given. Whereupon he replied to me 
with spirit, as was his manner: ‘ This is because I wish my 
children -to believe nothing which cannot be demonstrated as 
clearly to them as that two and two make four” My reply 
was in the same strain: ‘In that case, if I had thirty sons, 
I would not entrust one of them to you, for it would be 
impossible for you to demonstrate to him, as you can that 
two and two make four, that I am his father, and-'that I 
have a right to ‘his obedience.’ ”

438 THE HISTORY. OF- PEDAGOGY. 
It is evident that Pestalozzi was deviating from his own 
inclinations. ‘The general character of his pedagogy is in 
fact to avoid abstraction, and in all things to aim at concrete 
and living intuition. Even in religion, he deliberately 
excluded dogmatic teaching, precise and- literal form, and 
sought only to awaken in the soul a religious sentiment, 
sincere and profound. ‘The Pére Girard had remarked to 
him that thé religious instruction of his pupils was vague 
and indeterminate, and that their aspirations lacked the 
doctrinal form. ‘The form,” replied Pestalozzi, ‘<I am 
still looking for it!” 
515. Tue Last Years or Pesratozzt.— Disheartened by 
the decadence of his institute, Pestalozzi-left Yverdun in 
1824, and sought a retreat at Neuhof, on the farm where he 
had tried his first experiments in popular education. It is 
aere that he wrote his last two works, — The Swan’s Song and 
My Destinies. January 25, 1827, he was taken to Brugg to 
consult a physician. He died there February 17; and two 
days after he was buried at Birr. It is there that the Canton 
of Argovia erected a monument to him in 1846, with the 
, following inscription : — : 
“4 Here lies Henry Pestalozzi, born at Zurich, January 12, 
1746, died at Brugg, February 17, 1827, savior of the poor 
at Neuhof, preacher of the people in Leonard and Gertrude, 
father of orphans at Stanz, founder of the new people’s 
school at Burgdorf and at Miinchen-Buchsee, educator of 
humanity at Yverdun, man, Christian, citizen: everything 
for others, nothing for himself. Blessed be his name.” 
I 516, Essentian Princretes. — Pestalozzi never took the

exposition of his own methods. In his first letter to Gess- 
ner, he is only too happy to reproduce the observations of 
the philanthropist Fischer, who distinguished five essential 
principles in his system : — 
1. To give the mind an intensive culture, and not simply 
extensive: to form the mind, and not to content one’s self 
with furnishing it ; 
2. To connect all instruction with the study of language ; 
8. To furnish the mind for all its operations with funda- 
mental data, mother ideas ; 
4, To simplify.the mechanism of instruction and study; - 
5. To popularize science. 
On several points, indeed, Pestalozzi calls in question the 
translation which Fischer has given of his thought; but, 
notwithstanding these reservations, powerless to find a more 
exact formula, he accepts as a finality this interpretation of 
his doctrine. 
Later, another witness of the life of Pestalozzi, Morf, also 
condensed into a few maxims the pedagogy of the great 
veacher : — 
“ 1. Intuition is the basis of instruction ; 
2. Language ought to be associated with intuition ; 
8. The time to learn is not that of judging and of criti- 
cising ; 
4. In each branch, instruction ought to begin with the 
simplest elements, and to progress by degrees while follow- 
ing the development of the child, that is to say, through a 
series of steps psychologically connected ; 
5. We.should dwell long enough on each part of the in- 
struction for the pupil to gain a complete mastery of it; 
6. Instruction ought to follow the order of natura! 
development, and not that of synthetic exposition ; 
, % The individuality of the child is sacred ;
-P-A-G-E-470
440 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
8. The principal end of elementary instruction. is not te 
cause the child to acquire knowledge and talents, but te 
develop and increase the forces of his intelligence ; 
9. To wisdom there must be joined power ;. to theoretical 
knowledge, practical skill ; 
10. The relations between master and pupil ought to be 
* based on love; 
11. Instruction proper ought to be made snbordinate to 
the higher purpose of education. . 
Each one of these aphorisms would need a long com- 
mentary. Itis sufficient, however, to study them in the aggre- 
gate, in order to form an almost exact idea of that truly 
humane pedagogy which reposes on psychological principles. 
Kriisi could say of his master: ‘‘ With respect to the 
ordinary knowledge and practices of the school, Pestalozzi 
was far below a good village magister; but he. possessed 
something infinitely superior to that which can be given by a 
course of instruction, whatever it may be. He knew that 
‘which remains concealed from a great. number of teachers, — 
“the human spirit and the laws of its development and culfare, 
the human heart and the means of vivifying it and ennobling 
it.” 
517. PepacoctcaL Processes. — The pedagogy of Pesta- 
lozzi is:no less valid in its processes than in its principles. 
Without presuming to enumerate everything, we will indicate 
succinctly some of the scholastic practices which he employed 
and recommended : — 
The child should know how to peak ‘before learning to 
read. 
For.reading, use should be made of movable letters glued 
on pasteboard. Before writing, the pupil should draw. 
The first exercises in writing should be upon slates.
-P-A-G-E-471
SS 
aT 
A, PESTALOZZI. 44 
In the study of language, the evolution 4 nature should 
be followed, first studying nouns, then qualificatives, and 
finally propositions. 
The elements of computation shall be taught: by the aid of 
material objects taken as units, or at least by means of strokes 
drawn on-a board. Oral computation shall be the most 
employed. 
The pupil ought, in order to form an accurate and exact 
idea of numbers, to conceive them always as a collection of 
strokes or of concrete things, and not as abstract figures. 
A smail table divided into squares in which points are rep- 
resented, serves to teach addition, subtraction, multiplica« 
tion, and division. 
There was neither book nor copy-book in the schools ot 
Burgdorf. 
The children had nothing to learn by heart. They had te 
repeat all-at ence and in accord the instructions of the 
master. Each lesson lasted but an hour, and was followed 
by a short interval devoted to recreation. 
Manual tabor, making paper boxes, working in the garden- 
gymnastics, were associated with mental labor. The last 
hour of each day was devoted to optional labor. The pupils 
said, “ We are working for ourselves.” 
A few hours a week were devoted to military exercises. 
Surely everything is not to be commended in the processes — 
which we have Just indicated. It is not necessary, for ex- 
ample,-that the child conceive, when he competes, the con- 
tent of numbers, and Pestalozzi sometimes makes an abuse 
of sense intaftion. “He introduces analysis, and an analysis 
too subtile and too minute, into studies where nature alone 
does her work. “* My method;” he said, ‘‘is buta refinement 
of the procedies of ‘pature- ” He refines too much.
-P-A-G-E-472
442 THE HISTORY OF PRDAGOGY, 
518, Prsratozzt anp Rovusseavu.-—Pestalozzi has often 
acknowledged what he owed to Rousseau.‘ My chimerical 
and unpractical spirit was taken,” he said, ‘‘ with that chimer- 
ical and impracticable book. .. . The system of liberty ideally 
established by Rousseau, excited in me an infinite longing 
for a wider and more bounteous sphere of activity.” 
The great superiority of Pestalozzi over Rousseau is that 
he worked for the people, — that he applied to a great num- 
ber of children the principles which Rousseau embodied only 
in an individual and privileged education. Emile, after all, 
is an aristocrat. He is rich, and of good ancestry; and is 
endowed with all the gifts of nature and fortune.. Real pu- 
pils do not offer, in general, to the action of teachers, mate- 
rial.as docile and complaisant. Pestalozzi had to do only 
with children of the common people, who have everything to 
Jearn at school, because they have found at home, with busy 
or careless parents, neither encouragement nor example, — 
because their early years have been only a long intellectual 
slumber. For these benumbed natures, many exercises are 
necessary which would properly be regarded as useless if it 
were a question of instructing children of another condition. 
Before condemning, before ridiculing, the trifling practices o! 
Pestalozzi, and of teachers of the same school, we should 
consider the use to which these processes were applied. The 
real organizer of the education of childhood and of the peo 
ple, Pestalozzi has a right to'the plaudits of all those who 
are interested in the future of the masses of the people. 
519. Conciuston. — We should not flatter ourselves thal 
merely by means of an analysis of Pestalozzi’s methods, w 
can comprehend the service of a man who excelled in th 
warmth of his charity, in his ardor of devotion and of props 
gandism, and in I know not what that makes a grand pe!
-P-A-G-E-473

sonality, more than by the clearness and the exactness of 
his theories. It is somewhat with Pestalozzi as with those 
great actors who carry with them to their tomb a part of the 
secret of their art. 
He was especially great in heart and in love. To read 
some of his writings, we would sometimes be tempted to say 
that his intellect was far inferior to the expectation excited 
by his name; but what a splendid revenge he takes in the 
domain of sentiment!’ 
He passionately loved the people. He knew their suffer- 
ings, and nothing turned him from his anxiety to cure them. 
Tn the presence of a beautiful landscape, he thought less of 
the charming scene that was displayed before his eyes than 
of the poor people who, under those splendors of nature, led 
a life of misery. 
That which assures him an immortal glory is the high pur- 
pose that he set before himself,—his ardor to regenerate 
humanity through instruction. Of what consequence is it 
that the results obtained were so disproportionate to his 
efforts, and that he could say, ‘‘ The contrast between what 
I would and what I could is so great that it cannot be ex- 
pressed”? Even the French Revolution did not succeed in 
the matter of instruction, in making its works commensurate 
with its aspirations. 
The love and the admiration of all the friends of instruction 
are forever secured to Pestalozzi. He was the most sugges- 
tive, the most stimulating, of modern educators. If it was 
not given him to act sufficiently on French pedagogy, he was 
in Germany the great inspirer of reform in popular education. 
While he was despised by Bonaparte, he obtained, in 1802, 
from the philosopher Fichte, this fine compliment, ‘It is 
from the institute of Pestalozzi that I expect the regenera 
tion of the German nation.”

(520. Awazyrican Summary. — 1.‘ Inveniam viam ad 
faciam, ‘To know the end is to find the way ; and to be pos- 
sessed of an impuise to reach an end is to make a way. 
There are thus two. categories of educational reformers. 
Some see a goal by the light of reason and reflection, and 
then lay out a logical route to it which they.may or may not 
traverse, but which some one will ultimately traverse. 
Others are dominated by an intense feeling, and grope their 
uncertain way towards a goal whose outline and position are 
only dimly discerned through the mists of, emotion. With 
some, the motive is intellectual, with others, it is emotional; 
and in their higher manifestations these endowments are mu- 
tually exclusive. 
2. Pestalozzi belongs pre-eminently to the emotional re- 
formers.’ He felt intensely, but he saw vaguely. His im- 
pulses were the highest and the noblest that can animate the 
human soul, but at every stage in his career his success was 
compromised by his inability to see things in their normal 
relations and proportions. Conscious of his inability to 
frame a rational defence of his system, he was glad to bor- 
row philosophic insight from abroad; but he could not live 
with colleagues who would test the logic of his methods. 
3. Tested by the simplest rules of order, symmetry, and. 
economy, the schools organized by Pestalozzi were failures; 
but tested by the exalted humanity, the heroic devotion, and 
self-sacrifice of their founder, and by the new life which, 
through his example, was benceforth to animate the teaching 
profession, his schools were successful beyond all precedent. 
Judged by modern standards, Pestalozzi was a poor teacher, 
but an unsurpassed educator. 
4. The conception which the humanitarian warmth of Pes- 
talozzi’s nature converted into a motive, was that true edu 
tion is a growth, the outward evolution of an inward life
-P-A-G-E-475
PESTALOZZI. 445 
The conception itself was as old as David and Socrates, but 
it had ceased to have the power of a living truth. 
5. The history of human thought shows that there has 
ever been a tendency to separate form from content, or letter 
from spirit, and as constant a predilection for form or letter, 
as distinguished from content or spirit; and the essential 
work of reform has consisted in reanimation. This illustrates 
and defines Pestalozzi’s mission as an educator. The story 
of his devotion and suffering is the most pathetic in the his- 
tory of education, and it should be unnecessary to repeat the. 
lesson that was taught at such cost.]

521. Tae Pepacocy or THe NinereentH CENTURY. — 
Pestalozzi really belongs to our century by the close of his 
career, and especially by the posthumous glory of his name. 
With Freebel and the Pére Girard, we enter completely 
upon the nineteenth century; both, in different degrees and 
with characteristics of their own, continue the work of 
Pestalozzi.
-P-A-G-E-477
THE SUCCESSORS OF PESTALOZZI. 447 
522. Frapen (1782-1852).—It may be said of Frosbel 
as of Pestalozzi, that in France at least, he'is more praised 
than known, more celebrated than studied..: We have been 
tardy in speaking of him, —it is scarcely twenty years since ; 
but it seems that our admiration has sought to atone for the 
slowness of its manifestation by its vivacity and its ardor. 
The name of the founder of Kindergartens has become almost 
popular, while his writings have remained almost unknown. 
An impartial and thorough study of Frebel’s work will 
abate rather than encourage this excessive infatuation and 
this somewhat artificial enthusiasm. Assuredly, Freeel 
had grand qualities as a teacher; but he lacked a profound 
classical culture and also the sense of proportion. Like 
most of the Germans of this century, he has ventured on the 
conceptions of a nebulous philosophy, and following the 
steps of Hegel, he has too often deserted the route of obser- 
vation and experiment, to strike out into metaphysical diva- 
gations. Froebel’s imagination magnifies and distorts every- 
thing. He cannot see objects as they ate, but lends them 
a symbolical meaning, and wanders off into transcendental 
and obscure considerations. But his practical work is worth 
more than -his writings, and he cannot be denied the glory 
of having been a bold and happy innovator in the field of 
early education. ° . 
523. Tae Your or Fraper. — Freebel was born in 
Thoringia in 1782. He lost his motuer almost at birth, and 
was educated by his father and his uncle, both village 
pastors. We recollect that by a contrary destiny, Pestalozzi 
was brought up by his mother. From his earliest years he 
manifested remarkable traits of character, and also mental 
tendencies which were a little singular. He was dreamy and 
wholly penetrated with a profound religious sentiment. 4
-P-A-G-E-478
448 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
Thus, the day when he believed that he was assured by per 
emptory reasoning that he was not doomed to eternal flames, 
was an event in his life. Ardently enamored: of nature, he 
considers her as the true ingspirer of humanity. This had 
algo been the conception of Rousseau and of Pestalozzi, but 
it exhibits itself with much more power in the case of 
Freebel. , 
It is difficult to comprehend the exaggeration of his 
thought when he says that nature, attentively observed, 
appears to us as the symbol of the highest aspirations of 
human life. 
‘¢Entire nature, even the world of crystals and stones, 
teaches us to recognize good and evil, but nowhere in a more 
living, tranquil, clear, and evident way than in the world of 
plants and flowers.” 
Morality, thus understood, is a little vague. We do not 
deny that the calm life of the fields contributes to surround 
us with a pure atmosphere, and to beget within us wholesome 
and elevated aspirations; but one must have a singularly 
sentimental temperament to believe that nature can give us 
** the clearest and the most obvious” lessons in morals. 
524. Dirrerenr Occupations. —The first part of Fre- 
bel’s life gives evidence of a certain unsteadiness of mind. 
Inconstant in his tastes, he cannot settle on a fixed mode of 
life. Improvident and poor, like Pestalozzi, he is in turn 
forester, intendant, architect, preceptor; he feels his way 
up to the day when his vocation as a teacher is suddenly 
revealed to him. Moreover, he studies everything, — law, 
mineralogy, agriculture, mathematics. 
525. Vocation to Teacu. — It was in 1805, at Frankfort, 
that Freebel began to teach. He was then twenty-three. 
The teacher Gruner offered him a position as instructor in
-P-A-G-E-479
THE SUCCESSORS OF PESTALOZZI. 449 
the model school which he directed; Froebel accepted, but 
he was of that number who do nothing artlessly. ; 
‘An accidental circumstance determined my decision. I 
received news that my certificates were lost [certificates that 
he had sent to an architect to secure a position with him]. 
I then concluded that Providence had intended, by this inci- 
dent, to take from me the possibility of a return backward.” 
At the end of a few days he wrote to his brother 
Christopher : — 
‘Tt is astonishing how my duties please me. From the 
first lesson it seemed to me that I had never done anything 
else, and that I was born for that very thing. I could no 
longer make it seem to me that I -had previously thought of 
following any occupation but this, and yet I confess that the 
idea of becoming « teacher had never occurred to me.” * 
526. Fraet anp Pestatozzi.— At the school in Frank- 
fort, Frebel, still a novice in the art of teaching, attempted 
scarcely more than scrupulously to apply the Pestalozzian 
methods. 
And upon many points Froebel remained to the end a 
faithful disciple of Pestalozzi. Intuition-is the fundamental 
principle of his method, and we might say that his effort in 
pedagogy consists chiefly in organizing into a system the 
sense intuitions which Pestalozzi proposed to the child some- 
what at random and without plan. 
Freebel had had direct relations-with Pestalozzi. In 1808 
he went to Yverdun with three of his pupils, and there spent 
two years, taxing part in the work of the institute, and 
becoming acquainted with the methods of the master. He 
declares that it was a ‘« decisive ” epoch in his life. 
But let us note, in passing, the difference in character 
between Pestalozzi and Freebel. While Pestalozzi is ever
-P-A-G-E-480
450 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
ready to accuse himself with a touching humility, Froebel 
regards himself as almost infallible. He never attributes 
failure to his own insufficiency, but lays the blame on destiny 
or on the ill-will of others. Pestalozzi is ever forgetting 
himself, and he is so neglectful as to be uncouth in his attire. 
‘+ He never knew how to dress,” say his biographers ; ‘his 
distraction made him forget sometimes his cravat, and at 
others his garters.” Froebel, on the contrary, affected an 
elegant and theatrical bearing. He studied effect. At cer- 
tain periods, as we are told, he wore Hessian boots and a 
Tyrolese cap with high plumes. 
527..Tue Treatise on Spuericrry (1811).—It was 
about 1811 that the peculiar originality of Froeebel manifested 
itself, and this was done, it must be confessed, in an unfortu- 
nate way, by the publication of his Treatise on Sphericity. 
Pestalozzi somewhere wrote: ‘‘If my life is entitled to 
any credit, it is that of having placed the square at the basis 
of an intuitive instruction which has never yet been given to 
a people.”! This language coming from Pestalozzi is cer- 
tainly calculated to surprise us; but at least Pestalozzi 
meant square in the proper sense of the term, as 3 
geometrical figure, or as a form for drawing. When Fre- 
bel speaks to us of the sphere, and makes of it the basis of 
education, it is a wholly different thing. 
In reading the Treatise on Sphericity, we are sometimes 
tempted to inquire whether we have to do with a well- 
balanced mind, or whether an exuberant imagination has not 
eaused the author to lose the consciousness of reality. 
According to Frebel, the sphere is the ideal form:—- 
‘The sphere seems like the prototype or the unity of all 
bodies and of all forms. Not an angle, not a line, nota 
  
4 Comment Gertrude instruit ses enfants, translated by Darin, p. 204.
-P-A-G-E-481
THE SUCCESSORS OF PESTALOZZI. 461 
plaae, not a surface, is shown in it, and yet it has all points 
and all surfaces.” . 
Let this pass; but besides this, the sphere has mysterious 
relations with spiritual things; it teaches the perfection of 
the moral life. 
*¢To labor conscientiously at the development of the 
spherical nature of a being, is to effect the education of a - 
being.” 
An incident borrowed from the life of Froebel will com- 
plete the picture. He enlisted as a volunteer in 1812, and 
made the campaigns of 1812-1813, with Langethal and Mid- 
dendorf, who were afterward to be his colleagues. After 
the war, he returned to Berlin, passing through the whole of 
Germany. During the whole journey, he says, ‘‘I was seek+ 
ing something, but without reaching a definite idea of what 
I was in quest of, and nothing could satisfy me. Wholly 
engrossed in this thought, I entered one day into a very 
beautiful garden, ornamented with plants the most various. 
I admired them, and yet none of them brought relief to my 
inmost feeling. 
“Passing them in review, at a glance, in my soul, I sud- 
denly discovered that among them there was no lily... - 
Then I knew what was lacking in that garden, and what I 
was looking for. How could my inmost feeling have mani- 
fested itself to me in a more beautiful way? You seek, I 
said to myself, tranquil peace of heart, harmony of life, aad 
purity of soul, in the image of the lily, that peaceful flower, 
simple and pure. The garden, with all its varied flowers, 
but without the blossoms of the lily, was for me like life 
agitated and variegated, but without harmony and without 
unity.” 
528. New Sropres. — Froebel returned to Berlin in 1814, 
and there obtained an assistant’s place in the mineralogical

museum. He there studied at leisure the geometrical forms 
of crystals, and reflected anew on their symbolical meaning. 
Perhaps he derived from these studies the idea of the first 
gifts which he afterwards introduced into his Kindergartens, 
It was not till two years afterwards that he formed the defi- 
nite resolution to devote himself to the education of youth 
(1816). He first established himself at Griesheim, and then 
at Keilhau (a league’s distance from Rudolstadt), where, 
with five pupils, all his nephews, he opened a school which 
he called by a pompous title, and one hardly justifiable at 
the beginning, the General German Institute of Education. 
He succeeded in associating -with himself Langethal and 
Middendorf. The-establishment was administered at first on 
a very modest scale, as the- resources were slender; but it 
prospered little by little, and in 1826 it numbered more than 
‘itty. pupils. 
529. Institute at Ke1.uavu. — The principles of Pestalozzi 
were applied at Keilhau. Langethal and Middendorf 
passed their apprenticeship in the Pestalozzian method under 
the direction of Freebel. The three professors met in the 
common hall, and there were frequently heard as echoes 
from their discussion the words: intuition, personal initia- 
tive, proceeding from the known to the unknown. ‘* They are 
learning the system,” said the children who heard them. 
At Keilhau, physical, intellectual, and moral education 
marched abreast. The master was to attempt to penetrate 
the individuality of each child, to the end that he might thence 
provoke the free development of that individuality. The 
government was austere and the fare frugal. The system 
of physical hardening was carried to an extreme. The 
pupils, winter and summer, wore a blouse and cotton trou- 
sers. <A considerable time was devoted to religious exer:

eises. Froebel always remained attached to the Lutheran 
Church, though his orthodoxy might have seemed open to 
suspicion, and he always thought that education ought to be 
essentially religious. 
‘+ All education that is not founded on religion is sterile.” 
And he adds, ‘‘ All education that is not founded on the 
Christian religion is defective and incomplete.” ? 
530. Tue Epucation or May.—It was at Keilhau in 
1826, that Froebel published his principal work, The Edu- 
cation of Man? 
At that date, the idea of Kindergartens had not yet taken 
form in his mind; and The Education of Man was not so 
much the exposition of the practical applications of Froebel’s 
method, as a nebulous and tumid development of his meta- 
physical principles. It is a book little read, and, let it be 
confessed, partly illegible! We have ventured to speak of 
the nonsense written by Pestalozzi. What shall be said of 
the mystical dreams of Froebel? The pedagogy of the Ger- 
mans, like their philosophy, has for a century often lost its 
way in strange theories which absolutely surpass the com- 
prehension of the French mind. From a mass of vague and 
pretentious speculations on universal nature, there are culled 
with difficulty some ideas which are well founded. How- 
ever, let us try to gather up the obscure idea of Froebel- 
made still more obscure by the exterior form of the work. 
In the first edition Froebel had omitted to introduce into the 
text any division into chapters and paragraphs. The read- 
ing of this uninterrupted text could not fail to be laborious ; 
even with the somewhat artificial divisions which were subse-

quently introduced, The Education of Bia remains difficult 
to read and to analyze. 
531. Anatysis or THE Work.—The introduction is the 
most interesting part of the work: Weé might reduce the 
somewhat confused ideas which it contains to three ¢ssential 
points, to three general ideas, of philosophy, of psychology, 
and of pedagogy. 
The idea of general philosophy is this: * Everything comes 
solely from God. In God is the unique principle of all 
things.” 
It is.a vague pantheism which consists in believing that 
all the objects of nature are the direct manifestations of the 
divine activity. : 
‘she end, the destiny of each thing, is to publish abroad 
its being, the activity of God which operates in it, and the 
manner in which this activity is combined with the thing.” 
From these premises Freebel is logically brought to this psy- — 
chological statement, that everything is good in man, for it 
is God who acts in him. He pushes his optimism so far as 
to say: — 
‘From his earliest age the child yields himself to justice 
and right with a surprising tact, for we rarely see him avoid- 
ing them voluntarily.” 
The pedagogical conclusion is easy to guess: Education 
shall be essentially a work of liberty and of spontaneity. It 
ought to be indulgent, flexible, supple, and restricted to pro- 
tecting and overseeing. 
‘¢ The vocation of man, considered as a reasonable intelli- 
gence, is to let his nature act in manifesting the action of God, 
who operates in him; to publish God outwardly, to acquire 
the knowledge of his real destiny, and to accomplish it in all 
kiberty and spontaneity.’’
-P-A-G-E-485
THE SUCCESSORS OF PESTALOZZI. 455 
These last two words are repeated ad nauseam. Frosbel 
goes so far as to. say that there can be no general form of 
education to impose or even to recommend, because account 
must be taken of the nature of each child, and the free 
development of his individuality provoked by inviting him 
to action and to personal exertion. The choice in the mani- 
festation of the exterior form of education ought to be left 
to the intelligence of the educator, and there ought to be 
almost as many ways of educating men as there are individ- 
uals, with their own natures aspiring to a personal develop- 
ment. 
532. Love ror CHiLpREN. — Freebel, and this is perhaps 
his best quality, loves children tenderly. He speaks of 
them with touching accents, but he does not fail to mingle 
with his affection for them his habitual symbolism. The 
child is not for him simply the little real being that he has 
under his eyes. He sees him through mystic veils, so to 
speak, and, as it were, crowned with an aureole : — 
“Let the child always appear to us as a living pledge of 
the presence, of the goodness, and of the love of God.” 
533. Unrry or Epucation. — Freebel is always bitterly 
complaining of the fragmentary and scrappy character of the 
ordinary education. His dream was to introduce unity into 
it. In this respect he separates himself squarely from Rous- 
seau. The different stages of life form an uninterrupted 
chain. ‘Let life be considered as being but one in all its 
phases, as forming one complete whole.” 
534. Divrerent SracEs IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF Man 
—Frebel, in The Education of Man, considers in succes- 
sion the different periods of life.. The first three chapters 
treat of the jirst stages of development in man, —the nurseling, 
the child, the young boy. We here find pages full of charm,

456 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
upon the education of the child by the mother, and upon the 
progress of the faculties; but pretentious considerations 
and whimsical interpretations too often come to spoil the 
psychology of Freebel. 
“The child,” he says, ‘* scarcely knows whether he loves 
the flowers for themselves, for the delight which they give 
him, ... or for the vague intuition which they give him of 
the Creator.” 
Farther on he speaks of introducing the child to colors, 
and from this exercise he at once draws moral conclusions: 
the child loves colors because he comes by means of them 
‘¢to the knowledge of an interior unity.” 
535. Tue Natorarism or Fraser. —The elements of 
education according to Freebel are, with religion, the artis- 
tie studies, mathematics, language, and, above all, nature. 
‘Teachers should scarcely let a week pass without taking to 
the country a part of their pupils. They shall not drive them 
before them like a flock of sheep.... They shall walk with 
them as a father among his children, or a brother among his 
brothers, in making them observe and admire the varied 
richness which nature displays to their eyes at each season 
of the year.” 
536. New Exreriments in Teacuine. — The institute of 
Keilhau did not long prosper. In 1829 it was necessary to 
close it for lack of pupils. Froebel lacked the practical quali- 
ties of an administrator. In 1831 he tried in vain to open a 
new school at Wartensee in Switzerland. The attacks of the 
clerical party obliged him to abandon his project. - After 
several other attempts he was elected director of an orphan 
asylum at Burgdorf; and it was there that he resolved to 
devote his pedagogical efforts to the education of early 
childhood. :
-P-A-G-E-487
THE SUCCESSORS OF PESTALOZZI. A457 
The little village of Burgdorf had the honor, within a period 
of thirty-five years, of offering an asylum to Pestalozzi and 
to Frebel, and of being the scene of their experiments in 
pedagogy. 
587. Toe KrinperGarTens. —The master conception of 
Froebel, the creation of the Kindergarten, was only slowly 
developed in his mind. It was only in 1840 that he invented 
the term. Of course, given the imagination of Freebel, and 
his tendency to symbolism, children’s garden ought to be 
taken in its allegorical sense. The child is a plant, the school 
a garden, and Freebel calls teachers ‘“ gardeners of chil- 
dren.”! 
But before giving a name to his school for early childhood, 
Freebel had long cherished the idea of it. In 1835, at Burg. 
dorf, he attempted to realize it; in 1837, at Blankenburg, 
near Rudolstadt, he founded his first infant school. 
538. Oniein or THE KinpeRGARTEN. — Without wishing to 
belittle the originality of Froebel’s creation, it is right to say 
that it was suggested to him in part by Comenius. The phil- 
osopher Krause had pointed out to him the importance of the * 
writings of the Slavic educator. He studied them, and the 
Kindergarten certainly has some relations of parenthood with 
the schola materni gremii. There is, however, one essential 
difference between the idea of Comenius and that of Freebel, 
~—the first confided to the mother the cares which the second 
relegates to the teachers of the children’s gardens. . 
It is said that it was from seeing a child playing at ball 
that Frebel conceived the first idea of his system. We know 
1 Consequently it is wrong to take Froebel’s expression in the sense that 
he wished to establish by the side of each school a garden, a lawn ‘planted 
with trees and adorned with flower-beds. See Gréard, L’instruction pré 
naire & Paris, 1877, p. 72.
-P-A-G-E-488
458 -THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
what importance he attached to the spherical form and to 
play. The first principle of his Kindergarten was then that 
the child ought to play, and to play at ball. 
But Frebel enveloped the simplest ideas in prolix and 
whimsical theories. If he recommends the ball, it is not for 
positive reasons, nor because it is an inoffensive play, very 
appropriate to the need of movement which characterizes the 
child. It is because the ball is the symbol of unity. The 
cube, which was to succeed the ball, represents diversity in 
unity. It is also because the word ball is a symbolic word, 
formed from letters borrowed from the German words Bild 
von all, picture of the whole. 
Freebel came to attribute an occult meaning to the differ- 
ent letters of words. He thought he found in the figures of 
the year 1836, the date of his first conception of the Kinder- 
garten, the proof that that year was to open to humanity a 
new era, and he expressed his views in an essay entitled: 
The Year 1836 requires a Renovation of Life. In this we 
read such things as these: ‘‘The word marriage (Germau 
Ehe) represents by its two vowels e~e, life; these two vowels 
are united by the consonant h, thus symbolizing a double 
life which the spirit unites ; again, the two halves thus united 
are similar and equal each to each: e-h-e.” And farther on: 
‘© What does the word German (Deutsch) signify? Tt is de- 
rived from the word deuten (signifying to manifest), which 
designates the act by which self-conscious thought is clearly 
manifested outwardly.... ‘To bea German is then to raise 
one’s self as an individual and as a whole, by a clear mani- 
festation of one’s self, to a clear consciousness of self{.”” 
539. Tue Girrs or Fraser. — Under the graceful 
name of gifts, Froebel presents to the child a certain number 
of objects which are to serve as material for his exercises
-P-A-G-E-489
THE SUCCESSORS OF PESTALOZZI. 459 
The five gifts are contained in a box from which they are 
taken in succession, as the children are in a condition to re- 
ceive them. In the original plan of Froebel, these gifts 
were :™1, the ball; 2. the sphere and the cube; 3. the cube 
divided into eight equal parts; 4. the cube divided into eight 
rectangular parallelopipeds, in the form of building-bricks, 
which the child will use as material for little constructions ; 
5. the cube divided in each of its dimensions, that is, cut into 
twenty-seven equal cubes ; three of them are subdivided into 
two prisms, and three others into four prisms, by means of 
an oblique section, single or double. And to these gifts 
Freebel added other objects, such as thin strips of wood and 
little sticks for constructing figcres; and bits of paper for 
braiding, folding, dotting, etc. 
The conception of Froebel does not rest, as one might 
think, on the adaptation of the objects which he chooses in 
succession, to the faculties of the child. It is not this at all 
which interests him. The order which he has adopted is 
derived from another principle. According to him, the form 
of bodies has an intimate relation with the general laws of 
the universe. There is, consequently, a methodical grada- 
tion to be observed, according to the intrinsic character of 
the objects themselves, for the purpose of initiating the child 
into the laws of the divine thought symbolized in the sphere, 
jn the cube, in the cylinder, etc. Froebel was greatly irritated 
at those of his scholars who misunderstood the philosophical 
‘mport of his ‘ gifts,” and who saw in them only plays. 
«If my material for instruction possesses some utility,” he 
said, “it does not owe it to its exterior appearance, which 
has nothing striking and offers no novelty. It owes it sim-

ply to the way in which I use it, that is, to my method 
and to the philosophical law on which it is founded. The 
justification of my system of education ts entirely in this law; 
according as this law is rejected or admitted, the system falls 
or continues with it. All the rest is but material without any 
value of its own.” : 
Tt is this ‘* material,’’ however, which for Froebel had no 
value, that his admirers have above all preserved of his 
method, without longer caring for the allegorical sense which 
he attached to it. 
540. ArPeaL To THE INsTINcTS or THE CaILD. — That 
which makes, notwithstanding so much that is whimsical, the 
lasting merit of Freebel’s work, that which justifies in part 
the admiration which it has excited, is that he organized the 
salle @asile, the infant school, and that he realized for it 
that which Pestalozzi had attempted for the elementary 
school. He knew how to make an appeal to the instincts of 
the youngest child, to combine a system of exercises for the 
training of the hand, for the education of the senses, to 
satisfy the need of movement and activity which develops 
itself from the first day of life, and, finally, to make of the 
child a creator, a little artist always at work. 
For the old education, which he calls ‘* a hot-house educa- 
tion,” and in which the instruction, premature through lan- 
guage, smothers in their germs the native powers of the 
child, in order to excite his memory and his judgment by 
artificial means, — for this education he substitutes a free and 
eheerful education which cultivates the faculties of the child 
by love, and which makes a just estimate of his instincts. 
Books are suppressed, and lessons also. The child freely 
expands in play. 
541. Tae Importance or Pray. — With Frebel, play be- 
came an essential element of education. This ingenious
-P-A-G-E-491

wacher knew how to make of it an art, an instrument for the 
development of the infant faculties. 
“The plays of the child,” he said, ‘are, as it were, the 
germ of the whole life which is to follow, for the whole man 
develops and manifests itself in it; in it he reveals his 
noblest aptitudes and the deepest elements of his being. 
The whole life of man has its source in. that epoch of exis- 
tence, and whether that life is serene or sad, tranquil or 
agitated, fruitful or sterile, whether it brings peace or war, 
that depends on the care, more or less judicious, given to the 
beginnings of existence.” 
542. Principal Neeps or THE CurLp. — Gréard, in a re- 
markable study on the method of Freebel, reduces the aspira- 
tions of the child to three essential instincts : — 
1. The taste for observation : — 
“ All the senses of the child are on the alert; all the ob- 
jects which his sight or his hand encounters attract him, 
interest him, delight him.” 
2. The need of activity, the taste for construction :— 
“Tt is not enough that we show him objects; it is neces- 
sary that he touch them, that he handle them, that he appro- 
priate them to himself. . . . He takes delight in construet- 
ing; he is naturally geometrician and artist.” 
3. Finally, the sentiment of personality : — 
“He wishes to have his own place, his own occupation, 
his own teacher.” 
Now Froebel’s method has precisely for its object the 
satisfaction of these different instincts. 
‘To place the child before a2 common table,” says Gréard, 
“but with his own chair and a place that belongs to him, so 
thet he feels that he is the owner of his little domain; to 
excite at the very beginning his good will by the promise of

an interesting game; to develop in succession under his 
very eyes the marvels of the five gifts: toteach him in the 
first place, from concrete objects exposed to his sight, balls 
of colored worsted and geometrical solids, to distinguish 
color, form, material, the different parts of a body, so as to 
accustom him to see, that is, to seize the aspects, the figures, 
the resemblances, the differences, the relations of things; 
then to place the objects in his hands, and to teach him to 
make with the balls of colored worsted combinations of col- 
ors agreeable to the eye, to arrange, with matches united 
by balls of cork, squares, angles, triangles of all sorts, to 
set up little cubes in the form of crosses, pyramids, etc. ; — 
then, either by means of strips of colored paper placed in 
different directions, interlaced into one another, braided as 3 
weaver would make a fabric, or with the crayon,to drill him 
in reproducing, in creating, designs representing all the 
geometrical forms, so that to the habit of observation is 
gradually joined that of invention; finally, while his hand 
is busy in concert with his intelligence, and while his need of 
activity is satisfied, to take advantage of this awakened and 
satisfied attention to fix in his mind by appropriate questions 
some notions of the properties and uses of forms, by relating 
them to some great principle of general order, simple and 
fruitful, to mingle the practical lesson with moral observa- 
tions, drawn in particular from the incidents of the school 
~—this, in its natural progress and its normal development,is 
the method of Freebel.” 
543. Derecrs In Fraset’s Metnop.-— There is ground 
for thinking, notwithstanding all, that Froebel’s method is 4 
little complicated, a little artificial; and that it sometimes 
proceeds in opposition to the natural disposition of children. 
Their soul, he said, cannot in the first period of its develop-
-P-A-G-E-493

ment, recognize itself, apprehend itself, save in the percep> 
tion of the simplest forms of the exterior world, presented in 
a concrete manner. Now nature of herself does not offer 
these elementary forms ; it is necessary to know how to ex- 
tract them from the infinite diversity of things. And Fre- 
bel found these simple forms in the sphere, the cube, and the 
cylinder. 
But these forms, we reply, are but abstractions; it does 
not suffice to say that the cube and the sphere are material 
and palpable, — they are none the less the product of ab- 
stract thought on this account ; nature does not present these 
simple geometrical forms; everything in them is complex. 
Now the nascent thought is employed at first on real things, 
on the living and irregular forms of animals and vegetables ; 
then in this case, the mind proceeds naturally from the com- 
plex to the simple, from the concrete to the abstract. It 
seems, on the contrary, that Froebel begins with the abstract 
in order to arrive at the concrete. 
In the school of Freebel other defects have been developed. 
An abuse has been made of the exercises in imitation and 
invention. The child has been made to produce marvels of 
construction which take too much of his time and demand of 
him too much effort. It has been forgotten that these em- 
ployments. should be preparatory exercises, — means, and 
not the end of education. 
544. Tue Lasr Esrasiisuments of Fraser. — Towards 
1840, the ideas of Freebel began to become popular. His 
methods attracted attention. Then he wished to transform 
his achool at. Blankenburg into a model establishment. He 
addressed an appeal to the German nation in favor of his 
work, but it.was only slightly successful. Obliged in 1844 
to close his institute, through lack of resources, he: then

travelled through Germany in order to make known his 
methods. He did not derive from his journey the profit that 
he expected from it, and, discouraged, he returned once 
more to Keilhau, where he opened a course in method, ora 
normal course, for the use of young women who were pre- 
paring themselves for the education of infants. This asso- 
ciation with women, in which Froebel lived till his death, 
exercised a profound influence on the. development of his 
system. A much greater share of attention was given to the 
practical exercises, and the mathematics was put in the back- 
ground. 
In 1850 he obtained through the intervention of the Bar- 
oness von Marenholtz, one of his most ardent admirers, the 
lease of the Castle.of Marienthal, and to this he transferred 
his establishment. A long period of activity seemed open- 
ing before him. He personally directed. the games of the 
children, and trained the teachers; but. he died suddenly 
in 1852. ° 
545. Fraser axp Dresterwec. — However, before his 
death, Freebel was able to witness the growing success of 
his work. Each day he received eminent adhesions ; for ex- 
ample, that of Diesterweg.1 It was through the mediation 
of the Baroness von Marenholtz that Freebel and Diesterweg, 
the celebrated director of the normal school of Berlin, be- 
came acquainted. Diesterweg was a strong and practical 
spirit, who contributed much to the development of instruction 
in Prussia. At first he had a contempt for Freebel, whom 
he treated as a charlatan; but on his first conversation with 
him he changed his opinion. He was taken to the school- 
room in which Freebel was teaching; but wholly intent on

his work, Froebel did not observe the presence of the visitor. 
Diesterweg was impressed by seeing this old man devoting 
himself entirely to his little pupils, and his prejudices disap- 
peared. Toacertain extent he became the propagator of 
Frabel’s ideas. He agreed with him on his general concep- 
tion of the needs of the child, and of the province of woman 
as the earliest educator. 
546. Success or Fraser’s Work. —Frebel had other imi- 
tators.. Like Pestalozzi, he inspired a large number of minds 
by his writings, and through the zeal of Madame von Maren- 
holtz, and of some other disciples, his practical work pros- 
pered. The Kindergartens have been multiplied in many 
places, and particularly in Austria. 
“547, Tae Pire Grrarp (1765-1850). — The Pére Girard 
is the most eminent educator of modern Switzerland. Less. 
celebrated than Pestalozzi and Freebel, he yet has this advan- 
tage over them, of. having been better prepared for his pro- 
fession as an educator. After having finished a thorough 
and complete course of classical study, he for a long time 
taught the same subjects in the same school. He acquired 
experience and wrote his treatises only in an advanced age, 
ata time when he was in complete possession of his ideas. 
He was in fact seventy-nine years old when he published 
his book On the Systematic Teaching of the Mother Tongue.. 
It is a work of mature thought, and sums up a whole life- 
time of labor. Less addicted to system than Freebel and 
Pestalozzi, the Pére Girard still carries mere system too 
far, and makes a misuse of the principle which consisted in 
making of all the parts of instruction the elements of moral 
education,

atan early hour. While still very young he aided his mother 
in instructing his fourteen brothers and sisters. Like Frosbel 
he was passionately fond of religious questions. One day a 
he had heard his preceptor say that there was no salvation 
outside of the Roman Church, he sought his mother in tears, 
and asked her if the Protestant tradesman who brought her 
fruit each day would be damned. His mother reassured 
him, and he always remained faithful to what he called ‘the 
theology of his mother,” —a tolerant and broad theology 
which brought on him the hatred of the Jesuits. 
_ At the age of sixteen he entered the order of the Gray 
Friars, and completed his novitiate at Lucerne. He then 
taught in several convents, in particular at Wurtzburg, where 
he remained four years (1785-1788). He returned to Fri- 
burg in 1789, and for ten years he devoted himself almost 
exclusively to his ecclesiastical functions. 
But his vocation as an educator was even then indicated 
by some things that he had written. 
In 1798, under the influence of the ideas of Kant, whose 
philosophical doctrine he had ardently studied, he published 
a Scheme of Education for all Helvetia, addressed to the 
Swiss minister Stapfer, who was also the patron of Pesta- 
lozzi. 
It was only in 1804, that Girard devoted himself entirely 
to teaching, the very year in which Froebel began his work. 
He was appointed to direct the primary school at Friburg, 
which had just been entrusted to the Gray Friars. Girard 
received the title of ‘prefect of studies,” and for nineteen 
years, from 1805 to 1823, he exercised his functions as a 
teacher in that school. Very small in the beginning, the 
school had a remarkable growth. There was added to it 
even a school for girls. At first Girard had Gray Friars for 
colleagues ; but he soon replaced them with lay teachers,

who obeyed him better and devoted themselves more entirely 
to their task. The teacher of drawing was a Protestant. °° 
549. Success or THE Scuoou at Frrsure.— A disciple 
and an admirer of Girard, the pastor Naville, has related in 
his work on Public Education’ the brilliant results obtained 
by Girard in his school at Friburg. 
“He had trained a body of youth the like of which 
perhaps no city in the world could furnish. It was 
not without a profound emotion that the friends of hu- 
manity contemplated a spectacle so new and so touching. 
That ignorant and boorish class, full of prejudices, which 
everywhere abounds, was no longer met with at Friburg. . . . 
The young there developed graces of an amiable.deportment 
which were never marred by anything disagreeable in tone, 
speech, or manner. If, seeing children approaching you 
eovered with rags, you approached them thinking that you 
were about to encounter little ruffians, ‘you were wholly sur- 
prised to have them reply to you with politeness, with judg- 
ment, and with that accent which bespeaks genteel manners 
and a careful education. ... You will find the explanation 
in the school, when you observe the groups where these same 
children exercise by turns, as in playing, their judgment and 
their conscience. Three or four hours a day employed in 
this work gave the young that intelligence, those sentiments, 
and those manners which delighted you.” 
550. Tae Lasr Years or THE Pire Grrarp. — Notwith- 
standing the success of his instruction, the Pare Girard was

uits, whose college had been re-established in 1818. He left 
Friburg amid universal regrets, and retired’to Lucerne, where 
he taught philosophy till 1834. At that date he returned to 
his native city and lived a life of seclusion. It was then 
that he wrote his pedagogical works. But through his disci- 
ples, and particularly through the pastor Naville, the methods 
of the Pére Girard were known before he had Published any- 
thing. 
551. TEacnine or THE Motuer Tonaur. — Let us now 
examine the general spirit of the pedagogy of Girard. It is 
in the theoretical work which he published in 1844, and 
which was crowned by the French Academy in the same year, 
that we must look for the principles of his method. It con- 
sisted in ‘‘ choosing a study which may be considered as one 
essential part of the instruction common to all the classes of 
society, and which nevertheless is fit for calling into exercise 
all the intellectual powers.” This study was the mother 
tongue, which Girard employed for the moral and relizious 
development of children. 
Villemain, in his report on the books of Girard, has clear- 
ly defined the purpose of the common school as conceived by 
the educator of Friburg : — 
‘¢ Where the period of instruction is necessarily short and 
its object limited, a wise choice of method is the thing of 
first importance, for upon this choice will depend the educa- 
tion itself. If that method is purely technical, if its exclu- 
sive object is reading, writing, and the rules of grammar and 
computation, the child of the common people will be poorly 
instructed and will not be educated at all. A difficult task 
burdens his memory without developing his soul. A new 
process is placed at his disposal, one workshop more is open 
to him, so to speak; but the: trace left by that instruction

will not be deep, will sometimes even be lost through lack of 
application and exercise, and will not have acted on the 
moral nature, too often absorbed eventually by a monotonous 
devotion to duty or the excessive fatigue of bodily labor. 
The only, the real people’s school, is then that in which all 
the elements of study serve for the culture of the soul, and 
in which the child grows better by the things which he learns 
and by the manner in which he learns them.” 
552. AnaLysis or THIS Work.-—The book of Girard is 
divided into four parts. The first contains general considera- 
tions on the manner in which the mother teaches her children 
to speak, upon the purpose of a course of instruction on the 
mother tongue, and on the elements which should compose it. 
The second part is entitled: The Systematic Teaching of 
the Mother Tongue considered solely as the Expression of 
Thought. It is language considered in itself; but Girard 
desires that the word should always be united to the thought. 
“It is not necessary that the teaching of grammar should be 
reduced to verbal instruction ; it should also serve to develop 
the thought of pupils. 
In the third part, the Systematic Teaching of the Mother 
Tongue considered as the Means of Intellectual Culture, Girard 
considers everything which can contribute to the development 
of the faculties. 
In the fourth part, the Systematic Teaching of Language 
employed for the Culture of the Heart, Girard shows how the 
teaching of language may assist in moral education. 
A fifth part, Use of the Course in the Mother Tongue, is, 
so to speak, the material part of the book, and, as it were, 
the outline of the great practical work of Girard, the Edu- 
cative’ Course in the Mother Tongue.

—AIn other terms, Girard places himself .in succession at 
four different points of view in the teaching of language : — 
‘Four persons,” he says, ‘‘ ought to congur in construct- 
ing the course in the mother tongue: the grammarian, the 
logician, the educator, and, finally, the man of letters.” 
The task of the grammarian is to furnish the material of 
the language and its proper forms. 
The logician will teach us what must be done in order to 
cultivate the intelligence of the young. 
The educator will ever be inspired by this grand truth: 
«* Man acts as he loves, and he loves as he thinks.” He will 
try.to grave in the souls of children all the beautiful and 
grand truths which can awaken and nourish pure and noble 
pffections. 
Finally, the man of letters has also his part in ‘the course 
in language, in the sense that pupils, besides being required 
from the beginning of their studies to invent propositions 
and sentences; will have a little later to compose narratives, 
letters, dialogues, etc. 
554. Tan Grammar or Ipgas. — Elementary instruction 
should have for its purpose the development of the mind 
and the judgment. It is no longer a question of cultivating 
the memory alone and of causing words to be learned. The 
Pare Girard would have grammar made an exercise in 
thinking. 
‘sThe grammars in use,” he says, ‘*are intended simply 
to teach correctness in speaking and writing. By their aid 
we are able finally to avoid a certain number of faults in 
style and orthography. ... This instruction becomes a 
pure affair of memory, and the child becomes accustomed 
to pronounce sounds to which he attaches no meaning. The
-P-A-G-E-501

ehild needs a grammar of ideas....+ ‘Our grammars of 
words are the plague of education.” 
In other terms, grammar should be made above all else an 
exercise in thinking, and, as it were, ‘‘ the logic of childhood.” 
555. Discreet Use or Rutes.— The Pare Girard does 
not proscribe rules. The teaching of language cannot do 
without them; ‘‘but there is,” he says, ‘‘a proper manner 
of presenting them to children, and a just medium to hold.” 
In the teaching of grammar we must follow the course 
which the grammarians themselves have followed in order to 
construct their science: ‘‘The rules were established on 
facts. It is then to facts that they must be referred in 
instruction, in order that by this means children may be 
taught to. do intelligently what they have hitherto done 
through blind imitation.... Few rules, many exercises. 
Bules are always abstract, dry, and for this very reason 
péorly adapted to please children, even when they can com- 
prehend them. We ought, then, in general, to make a very 
sparing use of them.” 
So the Pére Girard particularly recommends practical 
exercises, oral instruction, the continual use of the black- 
board, the active and animated co-operation of all the mem- 
bers of the class, rapid interrogation, the Socratic method, 
the abuse of which, however, he criticises.?

into the love of systematizing. He believed that not only 
language, but all the branches. of study might contribute to 
moral education. 
‘He conceived,” says Naville, ‘‘that by means of a 
selection of problems adapted to the development of the 
social affections in the family, the commune, and the State, 
one might give to arithmetic such a wholesome direction that 
it might be made to contribute, not only to making the child 
prudent and economical, but even more to extend his views 
beyond the narrow circle of selfishness, and to cultivate in 
him beneficent dispositions.” } 
557. Moran Grocrapuy.-—It is in the same spirit that 
he claimed to find in the study of geography a means of 
contributing to the development of the moral nature. 
*¢ According to my honest conviction, every elementary 
work for children ought to be a means of education. If it 
is limited to giving knowledge, if it is limited to developing 
the faculties of the pupil, I can approve the order and the 
life which the author has known how to put into his work; 
but I am not satisfied with it. I am even offended to find 
only a teacher of language, of natural history, of geography, 
etc., when I expected something much greater, —an instructor 
of the young, training the mind in order to train the heart. 
. + Geography lends itself as marvellously to this sublime 
purpose, although in a sphere a little narrower.”?

Systematic Teaching of the Mother Tongue ; but in the four 
volumes of his Educative Course (1844-1846) he has applied 
his method. Full of new and radical views, original in the 
arrangement of material as in its system of exposition, 
revolutionary even in its grammatical terminology, this book 
is a mine from which we may borrow without stint, only 
we shall not advise wholesale adoption: there is matter to: 
take and to leave.! 
559. ANALysIs oF THIS Work. — The title indicates the 
general character of the work. In his Cours éducatif, Girard 
does not separate education from instruction. The purpose 
is to develop the moral and religious sentiments of the child, 
no less than to teach him his native language. , 
The first lessons in grammar ought to be lessons in things. 
The child is niade to name the objects which he knows, — pers 
sons, animals, things, — and through these he is made to ac- 
quire notions of nouns, common and proper, of gender and 
number. He is then induced to find for himself .the physical, 
intellectual, and moral qualities of objects, and by this means 
is made familiar with qualifying adjectives. Care is taken, 
moreover, while causing each quality to be named, as farther 
on while causing each judgment to be expressed, to ask the 
child, “Is this right? Is this wrong?” 
The agreement of adjective with noun is learned by prac- 
tice. The child is drilled in applying adjectives to the nouns 
which he has found, and vice versa. 
Once in possession of the essential elements of the propo- 
sition, the child begins the study of the proposition itself, 
and finally the study of the verb. Girard makes it a princi- 
ple always to have the conjugations made by means of propo-

te Penseignement secondaire, 1882.
-P-A-G-E-504
474 - HE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. ~ 
sitions. At first, however, he employs in-simple propositions 
only the indicative, the infinitive, the imperative, and the 
participle ; he postpones till later the study of the conditional 
and the subjunctive. It is to be noted, in addition, that he 
brings forward simultaneously the simple tenses of all the 
conjugations. 
The order followed by Girard is whoHy different from that 
of the ordinary grammars. This is how he explains.it:— 
‘* In their first part, the grammars set out in a row the nine 
sorts of words, and thus give in rapid suecession their defini- 
tions, distinctions, and variable forms, which introduces a 
legion of terms wholly unknown to the child. The second 
part of these grammars takes up these words again in the 
same order, so as, in an uninteresting way, to regulate 
their use in construction,— a tedious and arid system, which 
affords the child no interest.” 
Elsewhere, speaking of his own work, he writes : — 
‘‘My work differs essentially. from the grammars which 
are put in the hands of children. When we write on lan- 
guage for adults, we may adhere to definitions, distinctions, 
rules, and exceptions, and formulate statements regarding 
their proper use; but he who writes for children ought to 
have the education of the mind and heart in view, and regu- 
late on that basis the course and form of instruction. ‘The 
course ought to be rigorously progressive, and the pupils 
ought, from beginning to end, to “assist themselves in con- 
structing a grammar of their own.” 
*©So, instead of making generalizations on ‘the noun, 
adjective, verb, etc., and of connecting with these parts of 
speech all that relates to them, we must apply ourseives to 
the substance of language, passing step by step from tbe 
simple to the complex, and teaching children to think, in 
order to teach them to comprehend and to speak the language

of man. The little details cannot appear till later, and as 
occasion requires. From this there necessarily results a 
displacement of grammatical material which has been indus- 
triously collected and arranged. Hence, also, a great parsi- 
mony in definitions and abstract distinctions which repel 
children.” 
560. EpucationaL Inrivence or Tae Pitre Grrarp.— 
The influence of the Pére Girard was not extended simply to 
Switzerland: It has radiated abroad. His ideas have been 
disseminated in Italy, propagated by the Abbé Lambruschini 
and by Enrico Mayer. A journal even has been founded to 
serve as the organ of the ‘‘Girardists” of the Peninsula. 
In France, Michel, in the Journal de P’éducation pratique, 
and Rapet in different works,’ have commended to public 
attention the methods of the Swiss educator. Finally, it 
may be remarked that the principles very recently set forth 
by the Consei? supérieure de Vinstruction publique (1880), 
on the teaching of French in the elementary classes of the 
lycées, are in great part the echo of the pedagogical doctrine 
of the Pére Girard. 
[561. Anatytican Summary.—1. In this study we have the 
third exposition, in historical order, — Rousseau, Pestalozzi, 
Frebel, —of the doctrine of nature as applied to education. 
This doctrine may be summarized as follows :— 
The existing order of things is conceived as an animated 
organism, and is personified under the term Nature. All 
living things, such as plants, animals, and men, are products - 
of the creative power that is immanent in nature, and each 
is predetermined to an upward development in the line of

growth. This growth is an unfolding from within outward, 
and each individual thing, as a child, has reached the 
term of its development when it has. grown into the type of 
its kind. In the case of the human species, this growth is 
best when it is natural, and it is natural to the degree in 
which it takes place without the deliberate intervention of 
art. This process of development is Nature’s work, and its 
synonym is education. Education is best when it is most 
natural, that is, when it suffers least from human interfer- 
ence. The question of the relative parts to be played by 
Nature and by Art in education has given rise to two schools 
of educators. 
2. In Freebel’s application -of this doctrine, the original 
conception is obscured by three circumstances: 1. his deism; 
2. his mysticism or symbolism; 3. his dependence on artifi- 
cial agents, his ‘‘ gifts,” and his belief in the potency of 
abstractions. 
8. The Kindergarten hag introduced many ameliorations 
into primary instruction, and its tendency is to make child- 
life happy through. self-activity. Its shortcomings are that 
it undervalues the acquisition of second-hand knowledge, 
obscures the distinction between work and play, and indis- 
poses, and perhaps unfits, the pupil to contend with real 
difficulties.1 
4. The effect of this new movement in primary instruction 
upon educational science has been wholesome. It has induced 
a closer study of child nature, has enlisted the sympathies

and affections in support of elementary instruction, and has 
profoundly modified the conception of the primary school. 
5. Whether the Aindergarten is to be maintained apart, 
as an institution sud generis, or whether it is to lose its iden- 
tity by the absorption of its spirit into the primary school, is 
a question: for the future. Probably the latter result will 
follow. 
6. The misuse of a good thought is seen in the attempt of 
the Pére Girard to give a distinct moral value to every school 
exercise. It is the verdict of experience that the moral 
value of science is greatest when it is taught simply as science, 
and that the direct teaching of ethics should be conducted 
on an independent basia.]

features of the pedagogy of the nineteenth century is the 
constant progress in the education of women. Woman will 
be better instructed, and at the same time she will playa 
more important part in instruction. Primary schools for girls 
did not exist, so to speak, in France, at the commencement 
of this century. Fourcroy, who reported the bill of May 1, 
1802, declared that ‘‘ the law makes no mention of girls.” 
But through the efforts of the monarchy of July, and still
-P-A-G-E-509

more of the liberal laws of the second and of the third Repub- 
lic, the primary instruction of girls will become more and 
more general. Secondary public instruction will be created 
for women by the law of December 20, 1880, and the equality 
of the two sexes, in respect of education, will tend more ang 
more to become a reality, through the influence of govern- 
mental action as well as that of private initiative. 
But not less remarkable is the important part which women, 
by their abstract reflections or by their practical efforts, have 
taken in the progress of pedagogy. In the history of educa- 
’ tion, the nineteenth century will be noted for the great nume. 
ber of its women who were educators, some who were real 
philosophers and distinguished writers, and others, zealous 
and enthusiastic teachers. 
5638. Mapame pr Genus (1746-1830).— While she does 
not belong to the nineteenth century by her pedagogical 
writings, Madame de Genlis has certain rights to 8 foremost 
place in the list of the educational women of our time. She 
had in the highest degree the pedagogic vocation; only, that 
vocation became a mania and was squandered on everything. 
Madame de Genlis wished to know everything in order that 
she might teach everything. ‘‘ She was more than a woman 
author,” says Sainte-Beuve, wittily; ‘‘she was a woman 
teacher ; she was born with the sign on her forehead.” 
Young girls of their own accord play mamma with their 
dolls. From the age of seven, Madame de Genlis played 
teacher, 
“T had a taste for teaching children, and I became school- 
mistress in a curious way.... Little boys from the village 
came under the window of my parents’ countiy-seat to play. 
Tamused myself in watching them, and I soon took it inte 
my head to give them lessons.”
-P-A-G-E-510
480 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
Twenty years later, the village teacher became the gove 
erness of the daughters of the Duchesse de.Chartres, and the 
governor of the sons of the Duke de Chartres (Philippe- 
Egalité). : 
564, Prpacogica Works. —- The principal work of 
Madame de Genlis, Letters on Education (1782), treats of 
the education of princes and also of ‘‘ that of young persons 
and of men.” In giving it that other title, Adéle and Théo- 
dore, the author indicated her intention of rivaling Rousseau, 
and of educating a man and a woman more perfect than 
Emile and Sophie. 
Although she had a profoundly aristocratic nature, Madame 
de Genlis, after the revolution of 1789, seemed for an instant 
to follow the liberal current which was sweeping minds along. 
It was then that she published the Counsels on the Education 
of the Dauphin, and some parts of her educational journal, 
entitled Lessons of a Governess. She never ceased to preach 
love of the people to sovereigns, and in justice this must be 
said to her credit, that she did not write merely for courtly 
people. She protests, and with spirit, ‘‘ that she is the first 
author who has concerned herself with the education of the 
people. This glory,” she adds, ** is dear to my heart.” In 
support of these assertions, Madame de Genlis cites the 
fourth volume of her Thédtre d’éducation, which is, she says, 
«solely intended for the children of tradesmen and artisans ; 
domestics and peasants will there see a detailed account of 
their obligations and their duties.” 
565. EncrcLopzpic Epucation. —It has been said with 
reason that Madame de Genlis was the personification of 
encyclopedic instruction.?

“s Her programme of instruction had no limits, She favers 
Latin, without, however, thinking the knowledge‘of it indis- 
pensable. She gives a large place to ‘the living languages. 
At Saint Leu, her pupils garden in German, dine in English; 
and sup in Italian, At the same time she invents gymnastic 
apparatus, — pulleys, baskets, wooden beds, lead shoes. 
Nothing takes her at unawares, her over-facile pen stops at 
nothing;. she is universal. A plan for a rural school for 
ehildren in the country is wanted, and she furnishes it.’” 
566. Imrratton or Rousseau. — Madame de Genlis never 
ceased to criticise Rousseau, and yet, in her educational’ 
romances, the inspiration of Rousseau is everywhere present. 
How can we fail to recognize a pupil of Roussean in the 
father of Adéle and Théodore, who leaves Paris in order to. 
devote himself entirely to the education of his children, to 
make himself ‘their governor and their friend, and finally, 
to screen the infancy of his son and daughter from the exam- 
ples of vice”? And the methods manufactured by Rousseau, 
the unforeseen lessons, the indirect means employed: to in- 
struct without having the appearance of doing so, — Madame 
de Genlis desires no others. Nothing is more amusing than 
the description of the country-seat of the Baron d’Almane, 
the father of Adéle and Théodore. It is no longer a country- 
seat; it ig a. school-house. The walls are no longer walls; 
they are charts of history and maps of geography. 
** When we would have our children. study history. accord- 
ing to a chronological order, we start from my bed-chamber, 
which represents sacred history; from there we enter my 
gallery, where we find ancient history; we reach the parlor, 
which contains Roman history, and we end with the gallery 
of Monsieur d’Almane (it is the Baroness who speaks), where 
is found the history of France.”
-P-A-G-E-512
482 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
In her pedagogic fairyland, Madame de Genlis does not 
wish the child to meet a single object which may not be 
transformed into an instrument of instruction. Adéle and 
Théodore cannot take a hand-screen without finding a geog- 
raphy lesson represented on it, and drawn out at full length. 
Here are pictures worked in tapestry; they are historical 
scenes; on the back of them care has been taken to write 
an explanation of what they represent. At least, those five 
or six movable partitions which are displayed in the apart- 
ment on cold days have no instructive purposes? You are 
mistaken. There is painted and written on them the history 
of England, of Spain, of Germany, and that of the Moors 
and the Turks. Even in the dining-room, mythology encum- 
bers the panels of the room, and ‘it usually forms the sub- 
ject of conversation during the dinner.” In that castle, 
bewitched, so to speak, by the elf of history, there is not 4 
glance that is lost, not a minute without its lesson, not s 
corner where one may waste his time in dreaming. History 
pursues you like a ghost, like a nightmare, along the corri- 
dors, on the stairs, even on the carpet on which you tread, 
and on the chairs upon which you sit. The true way to 
disgust a child forever with historical studies is to condemn 
him to live for eight days in this house-school of Madame de 
Genlis. 
567. Miss Eperworra (1767-1849).—It is with the 
Scotch philosophy and the psychological theories of Reid and 
Dugald Stewart, that were inspired in different degrees two 
distinguished women, who honored English pedagogy at the 
beginning of this century, — Miss Edgeworth and Miss Han- 
ilton. 
In her book on Practical Education, published in 1798; 
—_—   
1 French translation by Pictet, 1801,
-P-A-G-E-513
WOMEN AS EDUCATORS. ~ 483 
Miss Edgeworth does not lose herself in theoretical disserta- 
tions. Her book is'a collection of facts, observations, and 
precepts: - The first chapter treats of toys, and the author 
justifies this beginning by saying that in education there is 
nothing trivial and minute. It is first by conversations, and 
then by the use of the inventive, analytical, and intuitive 
method, that Miss Edgeworth proposes to train her ‘pupils ; - 
and her reflections on intellectual education deserve to be 
considered. In moral education she agrees with Locke; and 
seems to place great reliance on the sentiment of honor, and 
on the love of reputation. In every case she absolutely 
ignores the religious feeling. The characteristic of her sys- 
tem is that it makes ‘a total abstraction of religious ideas.” " 
568. Miss Hamitron (1758-1816).— Miss Hamilton is 
at once more philosophical and more Christian than Miss 
Edgeworth. It is from the psychologist Hartley that she 
borrows her essential principle, which consists in making of 
the association of ideas the basis of education. Hartley saw 
in this the sovereign law of intellectual development. But, - 
on the other hand, she declares ‘‘ that she follows no other 
“guide than the precepts of the Gospel.” 
The principal work of Miss Hamilton, her Letters on the 
Elemeniary Principles of Education (1801),1 has a more 
theoretical character than the book of Miss Edgeworth. 
With her it is above all else a question of principles, which, 
she says, are more necessary than rules. We find but few 
reflections on teaching proper. She borrows the very words 
of Dugald Stewart to define the object of education : — 
“‘The most essential objects of education are the follow- 
ing: first, to cultivate all the various principles of our nature, 
both speculative and active, in such a manner as to bring 
  1 French translation by Chéron, 2 vols., Paris, 1804.
-P-A-G-E-514
484 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
them to the greatest perfection of which they are suscepti. 
ble; and secondly, by watching over the impressions and 
associations which the mind receives in early life, to secure 
it against the influence of prevailing errors; -and, as far 
as possible, to engage its prepossessions on the side of 
truth.” * : 
To cultivate the intellectual and moral faculties, Miss 
Hamilton places her chief dependence, as we have said, on 
the principle of the association of ideas. We must break up, 
or, rather, prevent from being formed, all false associations, 
that is, all inaccurate judgments. Order once re-established 
among ideas, the will will be upright, and the conduct well 
regulated. In other terms, this was to subordinate, perhaps 
too completely, the development of the moral faculties to the 
culture of the intellectual faculties. 
“Tt is evident,”’ says Miss Hamilton, ‘that all our desires 
are in accord with ideas of pleasure, and all our aversions 
with ideas of pain.” 
The educator will then try to associate the idea of pleasure 
with what is good and useful for the child and for the man. 
Let us also note, in passing, the solicitude of Miss Hamil. 
ton for the education of the people : — 
‘*From most of the writers on education it would appear 
that it is only to people of rank and fortune that education 
is a matter of any importance.... My plan has for its 
object the cultivation of the faculties that are common to the 
whole human race.”’? 
On this point her thought was the same as that of Miss 
Edgeworth, whose father, in 1799, in the Irish Parliament, 
had caused the adoption of the first law on primary instruc: 
tion. .

or finally in the institution at Ecouen, the direction of which

claims which at once assure to Madame Campan some author- 
ity on pedagogical questions.’ Let us add that good: sense, 
a methodical and prudent mind, —in a word, qualities which 
were reasonable rather than brilliant, —directed that long 
persongl experience. 
“First I saw,” she said, ‘‘ then I reflected, and finally I 
wrote.” 
570. Evtocy on Home Enucarion. —~From a teacher, 
from the directress of a school, we would expect prejudices 
in favor of public education in boarding-schools. That which 
secures our ready confidence, is that Madame Campan, on 
the contrary, appreciates better than any one else the advan- 
tages of maternal education : —: 
“To create mothers,” she said, ‘“ this is the whole educa- 
tion of women.” Nothing seems to her superior to a mother 
governess “‘ who does not keep late hours, who rises betimes,” 
who, finally, devotes herself resolutely to the important duty 
with which she is charged. 
“There is no boarding-school, however well it may be con- 
ducted, there is no convent, however pious its government 
may be, which can give an education comparable to that 
which a young girl receives from a mother who is edu- 
cated, and who finds her sweetest occupation and her true 
glory in the education of her daughter.” 
Madame Campan, moreover, reminds mothers who would

be the teachers of their own daughters, of.all:the obligations

who jealously keeps her daughter near her, is not capable of 
educating her. In this case there is only the appearance of 
home education, and as Madame Campan wittily says, ‘* this 
1s no longer maternal education; it is but education al 
home.” 
571. Progruss in Insrrucrion. — Fénelon was Madame 
Campan’s favorite author. On the other hand, there was 
some resemblance between the rules of the school at Ecouen 
and those of Saint Cyr. The spirit of the seventeenth cen- 
tury lives again in the educational institutions of the nine- 
teenth, and Madame Campan continues the work of Madame 
de Maintenon. 
However, there is progress in more than one respect, and 
the instruction is more solid and more complete. _ 
“The purpose of education,” wrote Madame Campan to 
the Emperor, ‘‘ ought to be directed: 1. towards the domes- 
tic virtues; 2. towards instruction, to such a degree of per- 
fection in the knowledge of language, computation, history, 
writing, and geography, that all pupils shall be assured of 
the happiness of being able to instruct their own daughters.” 
Madame Campan desired, moreover, to extend her work. 
She demanded of the Emperor the creation of several public 
establishments ‘‘ for educating the daughters of certain classes 
of the servants of the State.” She desired that the govern- 
ment should take under its supervision private institutions, 
and contemplated for women as for men 2 sort of university 
‘« which might replace the convents and the colleges.” But 
Napoleon was not the man to enter into these schemes. The 
schools of “ women-logicians ”” were scarcely to his taste, 
and the teaching congregations, which he restored to theit 
privileges, the better served his purpose.

572. Inrerest my Porutar Epucation. — One might be- 
lieve that Madame Campan, who had begun by being the 
teacher of the three daughters of Louis XV., and who asso- 
ciated with scarcely any save the wealthy or the titled, had 
never had the taste or the leisure to think of popular instruc- 
tion. Itis nothing of the sort, as is proved by her Counsels 
to Young Girls, a work intended for Elementary Schools... 
‘¢ There is no ground for fearing that the daughters of the 
rich will ever be in want of books to instruct them or of 
governesses to direct them. It is not at all so with the chil- 
dren who belong to the less fortunate classes.... I have 
seen with my own eyes how incomplete and neglected is the 
education of the daughters of country people.... It is for 
them that I have penned this little work.” 
The work itself has not perhaps the tone that could be de- 
sired, nor all the simplicity that the author would have wished 
to give it; but we must thank Madame Campan for her in- 
tentions, and we count among her highest claims to the 
esteem of posterity the effort which she made in her old age 
to become, at least in her writings, a simple school-mistress 
and a village teacher. 
573.. Mapame DE Ré&musat (1780-1821). —Madame de 
Rémusat has written only for women of the world. Herself 
a woman ‘of the world, lady of the palace of the Empress 
Josephine, she had no personal experience in the way of 
teaching. She had nothing to do with the practice of educa- 
tion save in supervising the studies of her two sons, one of 
whom became a philosopher and an illustrious statesman, 
Charles de Rémusat. The noble book of Madame de Rému- 
sat, her Essay on the Education of Women, does not commend 
itself by reason of its detailed precepts and scholastic meth- 
ods, but by its lofty reflections and general principles.) 
1 The work of Madame de Rémusat was published in 1824, after the aw 
thor’s death, under the direction of Charles de Rémusat.

488 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
574, Sketch or Feminine Psycuorocy.— Let us first 
notice different passages in which the author sketches by 
few touches the psychology of woman, and determines het 
sphere in life : — 
‘Woman is the companion of man upon the earth, but 
yet she exists on her own account; she is | inferior, but not 
subordinate.” 
The expression here betrays Madame de Rémusat, and it 
would be more accurate to say that woman is not inferior to 
man, that she is his equal, but that in existing civil and so- 
cial conditions she necessarily remains subordinate to him. 
But with what perfect justness the amiable writer charac- 
terizes the peculiar qualities of woman ! 
‘¢We lack continuity and depth when we would apply 
ourselves to general questions. Endowed with a quick in- 
telligence, we hear promptly, we even divine and see just as 
well as men; but too easily moved to remain impartial, too 
mobile to be profound, perceiving is easier for us than obsery- 
ing. Prolonged attention wearies us; we are, in short, more 
mild than patient. More sensitive and more devoted than 
men, women are ignorant of that sort of selfishness which 
an independent being exhibits outwardly as a consciousness 
of his own power. To obtain from them any activity what- 
ever, it is almost always necessary to interest them in the 
happiness of another. Their very faults are the outgrowths 
of their condition. The same cause will excite in man 
emotions of pride, and in woman only those of vanity.” 
575, Tue Srrrovs in Epucation. — Madame de Rémusat, 
still more than Madame Campan, belongs to the modem 
school. She desires for woman an education serious and 
grave. 
‘T see no reason for treating women less seriously tha

WOMEN AS EDUCATORS. ‘489 
men, for misrepresenting truth to them under the form of a 
prejudice, duty under the appearance of .a superstition, in 
order that they may accept both the duty and the trath.”” 
She does not in the least incline to the opinion of the over- 
courteous moralist Joubert, who, with more gallantry than real 
respect for women, said: ‘* Nothing too earthly or too mate- 
rial ought to employ young ladies ; only delicate material should 
busy their hands. ... ‘They resemble the imagination, and 
like it they should touch only the surface of things.”? 
Madame de Rémusat enters into the spirit of her time, and 
her admiration for the age of Louis XIV. does not make her 
forget what she owes to the new society, transformed by 
great political reforms. 
‘We are drawing near the time when every Frenchman 
shall be a citizen. In her turn, the destiny of woman is 
comprised in these two terms: wife and mother of a citizen. 
There is much morality, and a very severe and touching 
morality, in the idea which ought to be attached to that word 
citizen. After religion, I do not know a more powerful mo- 
tive than the patriotic spirit for directing the young towards 
the good.” 
It is no longer a question, then, of training the woman and 
the man for themselves, for their individual destiny. They 
roust be educated for the public good, for their duties in 
society, Madame de Rémusat is not one of those timid 
and frightened women who feel a homesickness for the past, 
whom the present terrifies. Liberal and courageous, she 
manfully accepts the new régime; she proclaims its advan- 
tages, and, if she writes like a woman of the seventeenth 
century, almost with the perfection of Madame de Sévigné, 
her chosen model, she at least thinks like a daughter of the 
Revolution.

490 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
576. Parosornican Srrarr. — That which is not less ré 
markable is the philosophical character of her reflections. 
She believes in liberty and in conscience. It is conscience 
which she purposes to substitute, as a moral rule, ‘‘ for 
despotic and superficial caprices.” It is no longer by the 
imperative term, you must, but by the obligatory term, you 
ought, that the mother should lead and govern her daughter. 
‘On every occasion let these words, I ought, re-appear in 
the conversation of the mother.” 
This is saying that the child ought to be treated as a free 
being. The end, and at the same time the most efficient 
means, of education, is the wise employment of liberty. 
While keeping the oversight of the child, he must be left to 
take care of himself, and on many occasions to follow the 
course that he will. By this means his will will be developed, 
and his character strengthened ; and this is an essential point 
according to Madame de Rémusat. 
“Tf under Louis XIV.,” she says, ‘‘ the education of 
woman’s mind was grave and often substantial, that of her 
character remained imperfect’? 
577. Mapame Guizort (1773-1827).— Madame Guizot 
first became known under her maiden name, Pauline de 
Meulan. In the closing years of the eighteenth century she 
had written several romances, and had contributed to the re- 
view of Suard, the Publiciste. In 1812 she married Guizot, 
the future author of the law of 1833, who had just founded 
the Annals of Education.! From this period, all her ideas 
and all her writings were directed almost exclusively 
  
1 The Annales de l'éducation appeared from 1811 to 1814. It is an inter 
esting collection to consult. In it Guizot published among other pedagog- 
ical works, his studies on the ideas of Rabelais and Montaigne, afterwards 
reprinted in the volume, Etudes Morales.
-P-A-G-E-521
- WOMEN AS EDUCATORS. 491 
towards ethics and education. She published in succession, 
Children (1812), Raoul and Victor (1821), and, finally, her 
masterpiece, the Family Letters on Education (1826). 
578. Tue Lerrers on Epvcation.-—~To give at once an 
idea of the merit of this book,’ we shall quote the opinion of 
Sainte-Beuve : — 
“The work of Madame Guizot will survive the Emile, 
marking in this line the progress of the sound, temperate, 
and refined reason of our times, over the venturesome genius 
of Rousseau, just as in politics the Démocratie of De Tocque- 
ville is an advance over the Contrat Social. Essential to 
meditate upon, as advice, in all education which would pre- 
pare strong men for the difficulties of our modern society, 
this book also contains, in the way of exposition, the noblest 
moral pages, the most sincere and the most convincing, 
which, with a few pages from Jouffroy, have been suggested 
to the Philosophy of our age by the doctrines of a spiritual- 
istic rationalism.” 
579. PsycHotocicat Orrimism. — The philosophical spirit 
is not lacking in the Letters on Education. The whole of 
Letter XII. is a plea in behalf of the relative innocence of 
the child. ‘That which is bad in the disorderly inclination, 
says the author, is not the inclination, but the disorder : — 
“The inclinations of a sentient being are in themselves 
what they ought to be. It has been said that a man could 
not be virtuous if he did not conquer his inclinations ; hence, 
his inclinations are evil. This is an error. No more could 
the tree produce good fruit, if, in pruning it, the disorderly 
flow of the sap were not arrested. Does this prove that the 
sap is harmful to the tree?”

492 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
It follows from these principles that: discipline ought not 
to be severe. 
‘Do you not think it strange,” exclaims Madame Guizot, 
*¢that for centuries education has been, so to speak, a sys- 
tematic hostility against human nature; that to correct and 
to punish have been synonymous; and that we have heard 
only of dispositions to break, and natures to overcome, just 
as though it were a question. of taking away from children 
the nature which God has given them in order to. give them 
another such as teachers would have it?” 
580. Narure or tax Curp.— That which gives a great 
value to the work of Madame Guizot is, that besides the 
general considerations and the philosophical reflections,. we 
there find a great number of circumstantial experiences and 
detailed observations which are admissible in a sound trea- 
tise on pedagogy. Like the psychology of the child, peda- 
gogy itself, at least in its first chapters, ought to be conceived 
and written near a cradle. Madame Guizot forcibly indi 
cates the importance of the first years, where the future des- 
tiny of the child is determined: ‘‘ In those imperfect organs, 
in that incomplete intelligence, are contained, from the first 
moment of existence, the germs of that which is ever more 
to proceed from them either for better or for worse. The 
man will never have, in the whole course of his. life, an im- 
pulse which does not belong to that nature, all the features 
of which are already foreshadowed in the infant. The infant 
will never receive a keen and durable impression, however 
slight, an impress of whatever kind, whose effects are not to 
influence the life of the man.” 
At the same time that she sees in the infant the rough 
draft of the man, Madame Guizot recognizes with a remark- 
able delicacy of psychologic sense, that which distinguishes.
-P-A-G-E-523
“WOMEN AS EDUCATORS. 493 
that which characterizes, the irreflective and inconsiderate 
nature of the child. What is more just than this observation? 
‘We often deceive ourselves in attributing to the conduct 
of children, because it is analogous to our own, motives 
similar to thoge which guide ourselves.” 
What better observation than the example which Madame 
Guizot cites,in support of this statement! 
‘‘Louise, by a sudden impulse, drops her toys, throws 
herself upon my neck, and cannot cease kissing me. It 
seems that all my mother’s heart could not sufficiently 
respond to the warmth of her caresses; but by the same 
playful impulse she leaves me to kiss her doll or the arm of 
the chair which she meets on her way.” 
581. Puitosoruic Rationaism. — Madame Guizot pushes 
rationalism much farther than Madame de Rémusat, and still 
farther than Madame Necker de Saussure. She is first a 
philosopher, then a Christian. She more nearly approaches 
Rousseau. She would first form in the minds of children the 
universal idea of God before initiating them into the particular 
dogmas of positive religions. She bases morals on the idea 
of duty, which is ‘the only basis of a complete education.” 
“*T would place,” she says, ‘‘ each act of the child under 
the protection of an idea or of a moral sentiment.” 
Recalling the distinction made by Dupont de Nemours 
between paternal commands and military commands, the 
first addressing themselves to the reason, the others to be 
observed without protest and with a passive obedience, she 
does not conceal her preference for the use of the first, 
because she would form in the woman, as in the man, a spirit 
of reason and of liberty. She absolutely proscribes personal 
interest, and hence declares that ‘‘rewards have always 
seemed to her contrary to the true principle of education.”
-P-A-G-E-524
494 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
Let us say, lastly, without being able to enter into detail, 
that the book of Madame Guizot deserves to be read with 
care. ‘There will be found in it a great number of excellent 
reflections on instruction which ought to be substantial 
rather than extensive; upon the reading of romances, and 
upon the theatre, which she does not forbid; upon easy 
methods, which she condemns; and, finally, on almost all 
pedagogical questions.’ 
582. pamMe Necker pe Saussure (1765-1841).— 
There are in the history of education privileged moments, 
periods that ave particularly and happily fruitful. It is thus 
that within the space of a few years there appeared in suc- 
cession the books of Madame de Rémusat, of Madame 
Guizot, and, the most important of all, the Progressive Edu- 
‘cation of Madame Necker de Saussure.” : 
A native of Geneva, like Rousseau, Madame Necker de 
Saussure has endowed French literature with an educational 
masterpiece, which for elevation of view and nobleness of 
inspiration, can take rank by the side of the Emile. Though 
she may sometimes be too logical and too austere, and while 
in general she is lacking in good humor, and while she looks 
upon life only through a veil of sadness, Madame Necker is 
an incomparable guide in educational affairs. She brings to 
the subject remarkable qualities of perspicacity and penetra- 
tion, and a spirit of marked gravity. She takes a serious 
view of life, and applies herself to training the noblest quali- 
ties of the human soul. Profoundly religious, she unites a 
‘¢ philosophical boldness to the submission of faith.” She 
is, in some measure, a Christian Rousseau.

583. Mapame Necker pe SavssurE AND MADAME DE 
§rait.— The first work of Madame Necker, Notice of the 
Character and the Writings of Madame de Staél, already gives 
proof of her interest in education. The author of the Pro- 
gressive Education here studies with care the ideas of her 
heroine on education and instruction. It is plain that she 
has profited by some of the solid reflections in the noble 
book on Germany, and particularly by this opinion on the 
gradual and progressive method of. Rousseau and of Pes- 
talozzi : — € 
“Rousseau calls children into activity by degrees. He 
would have them do for themselves all that their little powers 
permit them to do. He does not in the least force their 
intelligence ; he does not make them reach the result with- 
out passing over the route. He wishes the faculties-to be . 
developed before the sciences are taught.” 
“What wearies children is to make them jump over inter- 
mediate parts, to make them advance without their really 
knowing what they think they have learned. With Pestalozzi 
there is no trace of these difficulties. With him, children 
take delight in their studies, because even in infancy, they 
taste the pleasure of grown men, namely, comprehending 
and completing that on which they have been engaged.” 
Moreover, Madame Necker must have recognized her own 
spirit, her preference for a severe and painstaking educa- 
tion, in this passage where Madame de Staél vigorously pro- 
tested against amusing and easy methods of instruction : — 
“The education that takes place through amusement 
dissipates thought; labor of some sort is one of the great 
aids of nature; the mind of the child ought to accustom 
itself to the labor of study, just as our soul to suffering. . . . 
You will teach a multitude of things to your child by means 
of pictures and cards, but you will not teach him how te 
learn.”
-P-A-G-E-526
496 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
584. Procressive Epucarion anp Rousseau. —It is 
undeniable that Madame Necker owes. much to Rousseau ; 
but she is far. from always agreeing with him. 
For Rousseau, man is good; for her, man is bad. The 
first duty of the teacher should be to reform him, to raise 
him from his fall; the purpose of life is not happiness, as an 
immoral doctrine maintains, but it is improvement; the basis 
of education ought to be religion. 
Even when she is inspired by Rousseau, Madame Necker 
is not long in separating from him. Thus we may believe 
that she borrows from him the fundamental idea of her book, | 
the idea of a successive development of the faculties, to 
which should correspond a parallel movement in educational 
methods. Like the author of the Emile, she follows the 
awakening of the senses in the infant. She considers the 
infant as a being sui generis ‘‘ who lives only on sensations 
and desires.” She sees in the infant a distinct period of life, 
an age whose education has its own special rules. But at 
that point the resemblances stop; for Madame Necker de 
Saussure hastens to add that, from the fifth year, the child 
is in possession of all his intellectual faculties. He is no 
longer simply a sentient being, a robust animal like Emile; 
but he is a complete being, soul and body. Consequently, 
education should take account of his double nature. Moral 
education ought not to be-separated from physical education, 
and cannot begin too soon. 
“Tt is a great error to believe that nature proceeds in the 
systematic order imagined by Rousseau. With her, we 
nowhere discern a commencement; we do not surprise her at 
creating, and it always seems that she is developing.” . 
So, in education, we must know how to appeal, at the 
same time and as soon as possible, to the different motives, 
instinctive or reflective, selfish or affectionate, which sway 
the will.
-P-A-G-E-527
| WOMEN AS EDUCATORS, 497 
Often, in practice, the two thinkers approach each other, 
and, even in her protestations against her countryman, 
Madame Necker de Saussure preserves something of Rous- 
seau’s spirit. Thus, she does not desire the negative educa- 
tion which leaves everything to nature. The teacher ought 
not to allow the child to do (laisser faire), but cause him to 
do (faire faire). But, at the same time, she demands that 
the will be strengthened, so that education may find in ita 
point of support ; that the character be hardened; that some 
degree of independence be accorded to the child; ‘that in 
permissible cases he be allowed to come to his own decision ; 
and that half-orders, half-obligations, tacit entreaties, and 
insinuations, be avoided.” Is not this retaining all that is 
just and practical in Rousseau’s theory, namely, the necess‘ty 
of sesocating the-sped'al-ond spontaneous powers of the 
child"with the work of education? Madame de Saussure 
adopts a just medium between the active education which 
makes a misuse of the master’s instruction, and the passive 
education which makes a misuse of the pupil’s liberty. She 
would willingly have accepted this precept of Froebel, ‘* Let 
teachers not lose sight of this truth: it is necessary that 
always and at the same time they give and take, that they 
precede and follow, that they act and Iet act.” 
585. Oriernatiry or Mapame Necker. — Though she had 
reflected much on the writings of her predecessors, it is never- 
theless to her personal experience and to her original investi- 
gations that Madame Necker owes the best of her thought. | 
She had herself followed the advice which she gives to moth- 
ers, of “observing their children, and of keeping a journal, 
in which a record should be made of each step of progress, 
and in which all the vicissitudes of physical and moral health 
should be noted.” It is a rich psychological fund, and at the
-P-A-G-E-528

same time a perpetual aspiration after the ideal, which makes 
the strength and the beauty of the Progressive Educatio: 
With what penetrating insight Madame Necker has pointe 
out the difficulty and also the charm of the study of children: 
«Tt were so delightful to fix the fugitive image of child- 
hood, to prolong indefinitely the happiness of contemplating 
their features, and to be sure of ever finding again those dear 
creatures whom, alas, we are always losing as children, even 
when we still have the happiness of keeping them!” 
‘¢We must love children in order to know them, and we 
divine them less by the intelligence than by the heart.” 
Thanks to the pronounced taste for the'study of child 
nature, the most just psychological observations are ever 
mingled, in the Progressive Education, with the precepts of 
education, and it has been truly said that ‘‘this book is 
almost a journal of domestic education which takes the pro- 
portions of a theory.” . 
586. Division or THE Procresstve Epucation. — The 
Progressive Education appeared in 1836 and 1838 in three 
volumes. The first three books treat of the history of the 
soul in infancy; the fourth examines the general principles 
of teaching, independently, of the age of the pupil; the fifth 
studies the child of from five to seven years of age ; the sixth 
takes us to the tenth year; the seventh shows ‘‘ the distinc- 
tive marks of the character and the intellectual development 
of boys, during the years which immediately precede ado- 
lescence.” Finally, the last four books form a complete 
whole, and treat of the education of women during the whole 
course of life. 
587. DEVELOPMENT oF THE Facutries.— We cannot at- 
tempt in this place to analyze a work so rich in ideas as the 
work of Madame Necker. Let us limit ourselves to indicating

“e, 
the essential points in her system of education,” First, it fn 
the preoccupation of training the will, a faculyy which is too” 
much neglected by teachers, but which, peyertheleas, i is the 
endowment which dominates life. Madame Ne éckay freats thig ;) hy 
abject in a masterly way in a chapter tozwhich she prefixes     
“4ese words as a superscription : — Bok, 
‘Obedience to law constrains the will without enfecbling 
it, while obedience to man injures it or enervateé jt. as 
“Tt is, above all, to place the interior education of the 
soul above superficial and formal instruction. 
“To instruct a child is to construct him within ; it is to 
make him become a man.” 
588. Currure or THE Imagination. — Whatever impor- 
tance she attaches to the active powers, Madame Neckir does 
not neglect the contemplative faculties. - The imagination, . 
next to the will, is the faculty of the soul which has most 
often engrossed her attention. : 
“She has made it appear,” says a distinguished writer, 
“that this irresistible power, when we believe it to have been | 
conquered, takes the most diverse forms; that it disguises 
its power and arouses with a secret fire the most miserable 
passions. If you refuse it space and liberty, it slinks away 
in the depths of selfishness, and under vulgar features it 
becomes avarice, cowardice, and vanity.” 
“So it is necessary to see with what tender anxiety 
Madame Necker watches its first movements in. the soul of 
the child; with what intelligent care she secks to make of it 
from entrance upon life, the companion of truth; how she 
surrounds it with everything which can establish it within the 
tircle of the good. The studies which extend our intellectual 
horizon, the spectacle of nature in her marvelous diversities, 
the emotions of the arts, — nothing seems to her superfluous

or dangerous for directing the imagination in the way that is 
good, . She fears to see it escape, through the lack of pleas- 
ures that are intense enough, in the direction of other routes.” 
\ Ta | other terms, it is not proposed to repress the imagina- 
tion, still less to destroy it; but merely to guide. it gently, 
to associate it with reason and virtue, to awaken it to a taste 
for the good,-and to an admiration for nature. 
“ Show hitn a beautiful sunset, in order that nothing which 
ean enchant him may pass unnoticed.” 
589. Tue Epucation or Women. —In her special studies 
on the education of women, Madame Necker, who in other 
parts of her work sometimes makes an improper use of vague 
declarations of principles, without entering sufficiently into 
the details of practical processes, has had the double merit 
of assigning to the destiny of women an elevated ideal, and 
of determining with precision the means of attaining it. 
She complains that we too often adhere to Rousseau’s pro- 
gramme, that of an education which relates exclusively to 
the conjugal duties of the woman. She recommends that the 
marriage of young girls be delayed, so that they may have 
time to become “enlightened spirits and intelligent crea- 
tures” ; so that they may acquire, not ‘‘an assortment of all’ 
petty knowledges,” but a solid instruction, which prepares 
them for the duties of society and of maternity, which make 
of them the first teachers of their children, which, in a word, ° 
starts them on the way towards that personal perfection 
which they will never completely attain except by the efforts 
of their whole life.’

Garnier. 
2 We must include in the educational school of Madame Necker de 
Saussure one of her countrymen, the celebrated Vinet (1799-1847), who, in 
his excellent book, L’Hducation, la famille et la société (Paris, 1855), has 
vigorously discussed certain educational questions.
-P-A-G-E-531

590. Mapame Pare-Carpentier (1815-1878).— With 
Madame Pape-Carpentier, we leave the region of theories to 
enter the domain of facts; we have to do with a practical, 
teacher. In 1846, after several trials at teaching at La 
Fléche, her native city, and at Mans, she published her 
Counsels on the. Management of Infant Schools. In 1847 she 
founded at Paris a Mothers’ Normal School, which the next 
year, under the ministry of Carnot, became a public estab- 
lishment, and which, in 1852, under the ministry of Fortoul, 
took the distinctive title Practical Courses on Infant Schools. 
It is there that during twenty-seven years Madame Pape- 
Carpentier applied her methods and trained a large number 
of pupils, more than fifteen hundred, who have propagated 
in France and abroad her teaching and her ideas. In 1847 
she was removed from the management of her normal school 
through intrigues; but her loss of position was not of long 
duration. A little later she was appointed inspector-gengral 
of infant schools. 
591, GeneraL CHARACTER OF HER Works. — Madame 
Pape-Carpentier may be considered as a pupil of Pestalozzi 
and of Freebel. She was specially occupied with elementary 
‘education, and carried into her work a spirit of great sim- 
plicity. We must not demand of her ambitious generalities 
nor views on abstract metaphysics ; but she excels in practical 
wisdom, and speaks the language of childhood to perfection. 
592. Princrpan Works oF Mapame Pape-CarPENtrer. 
~—Among the important works of Madame Pape-Carpentier 
we shall recommend the following in particular : — 
1. Advice on the Management of Infant Schools (1845). 
In her preface the author excuses herself for undertaking 
“a subject of such gravity.” But she goes on to say that © 
‘“‘no instruction has yet been given the teacher on the educa-

tion of the poor child,” and she asks the privilege of speak- 
ing in the name of her personal experience. This book, 
often reprinted, has become Enseignement pratique dans les 
sales @asile.t 
. Narratives and Lessons on Objects (1858). This is a 
collection of little stories, ‘‘simple as. childhood,” which 
were tested before children before being written, and in 
which Madame Pape-Carpentier attempts to teach them 
things which are good: ‘‘ I mean,” she says, ‘‘ things really, 
seriously good.” 
8. Pedagogical Discussions held at the Sorbonne (1867). 
During the Universal Exposition of 1867, Monsieur 
Duruy had assembled at Paris a certain number of teachers 
before whom pedagogical discussions were held. Madame 
Pape-Carpentier took upon herself the special task of ex- 
plaining to them how the methods of the infant school might 
be introduced into the primary school. 
4. Reading and Work for Children and Mothers (1873). 
Here Madame Pape-Carpentier is especially intent on 
popularizing the methods of Froebel; she suggests ingenious 
exercises which can be applied to children to give them skill 
in the use of their fingers, and to i inspire them with a taste 
for order and symmetry. 
5. Complete Course of Education (1874). This book, 
which would have been the general statement of the peda- 
gogical principles of the author, was left incomplete. Only 
three volumes have appeared. A few quotations will make 
known their spirit. : . 
**To co-operate with nature in her work, to extend it, to 
~ correct her when she goes wrong, — such is the task of the 
+ educator. In all grades of education, nature must be 
respected. .

The child should live in the midst of fresh and,soothing 
impressions ; the objects which surround him in the school 
should be graceful and cheerful. 
‘Socrates has admirably said, ‘The duty of education is 
to give the idea birth rather than to communicate it.’” 
6. Note on the Education of the Senses, and some Peda- 
gogical Appliances (1878). Madame Pape-Carpentier is 
very much interested in the education of the senses, because, 
she says, ‘every child born into the world is a workman in 
prospect, a future apprentice to an occupation still unknown.” 
It is then necessary to perfect at an early hour the natural 
tools he will need in order to fulfill his task. The education .. 
of the senses will have its place some day or other in thé 
official programmes, and, for this sense-training, instruments 
are just as necessary as books are for the culture of the in- 
tellect. 
593, Lzssons on Osgecrs. — ‘¢ The object-lesson is the 
new continent on which Madame Pape-Carpentier has planted 
her standard.” She herself wrote a number of works which 
contain models of object-lessons; she has stated the theory 
of them, notably in her discussions of 1867. It is even 
permissible to think that she has made a wrong use of them. 
With her, the object-lesson becomes a universal process 
which she applies. to all subjects, to chemistry, to physics, 
to grammar, to geography, and to ethics. 
However it may be, this is the course to follow according 
to her: it is necessary to conform to the order,in which the 
perceptions. of the intelligence succeed each. other. The 
child’s attention is first struck by color. Then he will dis- 
tinguish the form of the object, and would know its use, — 
its material, and mode of production. It is according to 
this natural development of the child’s curiosity that the 
object-lesson should proceed. , . '
-P-A-G-E-534
604 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
Moreover, it can be given with reference to everything. 
Madame Pape-Carpentier admits what she calls ‘‘ occasional 
lessons”; but she also thinks that object-lessons can be 
given according to a plan, a fixed programme. 
Madame Pape-Carpentier deserves, then, to be heard as an 
experienced adviser in whatever relates to elementary in- 
struction; but that which we mnst admire in ber still more 
than her professional skill and her pedagogical knowledge, it 
an elevated conception of the teacher’s work, and a lofty in 
spiration coming from her devotion to children and her lov: 
for them. 
“To educate children properly,” she said, ‘ought to be 
for the teacher only the second part of his undertaking ; the 
first, and the most difficult, is to perfect himself.” 
‘« What we are able to do for children is measured by the 
love we bear them.”

cation of women has received an important development in 
our day, it is due, then, in great part to the women who have 
shown what they were worth and what they could do, either 
as teachers or as educators. And yet the history whose 
principal features we have just traced remains very incom- 
plete. By the side of the celebrated women whose works we 
have studied, we should mention Mademoiselle Sauvan, who, 
in 1811, founded at Chaillot an educational establishment 
which she did not leave till about 1830, to take the intel- 
lectual and moral direction of the girls’ schools of Paris ;1

tion of Women,? in which she’ sums up the results of a long

experience acquired in the management of a private boarding- 
school. . ‘ 
But men have also contributed by their theoretical objec- 
tions, or by their practical efforts, to the progress of the edu- 
cation of women. It would be of interest, for example, to 
study the courses in secondary instruction of Lourmand 
(1834), and the Courses in Maternal Education, of Lévi 
Alvarés (1820). ‘‘ Monsieur Lévi,” says Gréard, ‘‘ makes the 
nother tongue and history the basis of instruction. He him- 
self sums up his methods in this formula of progressive edu- 
tation: Facts, comparison of facts, moral or philosophical 
consequence of facts; that is, seeing, comparing, judging. 
This is the very order of nature.” Let us mention also the 
work of Aimé Martin, The Education of Mothers,' which for 
several years enjoyed an extraordinary reputation that it 
would be rather difficult to justify. 
595. DupaNntour AND THE EpucatTion or Women. —A 
bishop of the nineteenth century, Dupanloup, has assumed 
torival Fénelon in the delicate question of the education of 
women. Different works, and in particular the one which he 
esteemed most, his Letters on the Education of Girls, pub- 
lished after his death in 1879, give proof of the interest 
which he took in these questions. These letters are for the 
most part real letters which were addressed to women of the 
time. Notwithstanding the variety and the freedom of the 
epistolary form, the work may be divided into three parts: 
1. the principles of education; 2. the education of young 
women ; 8. free and personal study in the world. Dupanloup 
should be thanked for having summoned woman to a true 
intellectual culture, and for not consenting to have her facul- 
ties remain ‘‘ smothered and useless.” Through the revela-_

tions of the confessional and the spiritual direction of a great 
number of women, Dupanloup knew exactly, what a void 
an incomplete education of the mind and heart leaves in the 
soul. He is indeed willing to acknowledge that piety is not 
enough, and with a certain breadth of spirit which drew upon 
him the censure of the ultramontane press, he recommends 
the serious studies to women. His counsels, however, are 
addressed only to women of the middle classes, to those who, 
he says, ‘‘occupy-the third story of houses in Paris.” His 
book is rather a reminiscence of the seventeenth century, of 
its manners and its habits of thinking, than a living work of 
to-day, adapted to the needs of modern society. 
{596. Awatytican Summary. — 1. The formal discussion 
of woman’s education by women marks an important epoch 
in the history of education. Had the education of men been 
wholly, or even chiefly, discussed by women, it cannot be 
doubted that it would have been more or less partial and 
imperfect. . 
2, The formal discussion of infant education by women is 
scarcely less important; for nothing less than maternal in- 
stinct and affection can divine the nature and the needs of 
the child. 
3. This study calls attention to the need of making the 
education of women serious instead of ornamental. Plato 
based his recommendation of the equal education of men and 
women on equality of civil functions. In modern thought 
it is the conception of equal rights and of equal abilities 
that tends to prescribe the same course of intellectual train- 
ing for both sexes.

effort more and more marked to organize education in accord- 
ance with the data of psychology and on a scientific basis, 
and to co-ordinate pedagogical methods in accordance with a 
rational plan; a manifest tendency to take the control of 
education from the hands of the Church in order to restore it 
to the State and to lay society; a larger part accorded the 
family in the management of children ; a faith more and more

sanguine in the efficacy of instruction, and an ever-growing 
purpose to have every member of the human family partici- 
pate in its benefits, — such are some of the characteristics of 
the pedagogy of the nineteenth century. Education tends 
more and more to become a social problem; it is to be an 
affair of universal interest. It is no longer to be merely a 
question of regulating select studies for the use of a few who 
are the favorites of birth and fortune; but science must be 
olaced within the reach of all, and through the simplification 
of methods and the universal distribution of knowledge, it 
must be adapted to the democratic spirit of the new society. 
We have no intention to follow in this place, in all its 
details, and in the diversity of its currents, this educational 
movement of a century which has not yet said its last word ; 
but we must limit ourselves to calling attention to the points 
which seem to us essential. 
598. Laws or THe Councits-GeneraL or 1801,— Not- 
withstanding the efforts of the Revolution, public instruction 
in France, during the first part of the nineteenth century, 
was far from being flourishing. There was urgent need of 
introducing reforms. ‘The Councils-General were summoned 
in 1801 to give their advice on the organization of studies. 
That which is very noticeable in the State papers of the 
Councils-General of 1801, is that the departmental assem- 
plies agree in demanding the establishment of a National 
University. The Councils-General complain that the pro- 
fessors, being no longer united by the ties of solidarity, as 
were the members of the religious teaching congregations of 
the old régime, march at random, without unity, without 
concerted direction. They solicit, then, a uniform organi- 
zation of instruction. They even conceive the idea of an 
official instruction administered exclusively by the State.
-P-A-G-E-540
510 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
599. Fourcroy! anp Tue Law or 1802.—We have not 
the space to dwell long on the bill of Fourcroy, which became 
the law of 1802, although this measure, it has been said, was 
amended twenty-three times before being submitted to the 
Corps Législatif and to the Tribunate. 
Foureroy did not sufficiently recognize the rights of the 
State. Doubtless he did not go so far as to assert, with 
Adam Smith, that education should be abandoned entirely 
to private enterprise; but he thinks that the task of organ- 
izing the primary schools must be left to the communes. 
In his opinion, that which prevented the success of these 
schools was the attempt to impose too great a uniformity 
on them. He demands that the teachers be chosen by the 
mayors, or by the municipal councillors, who alone are cog- 
nizant of the local interests. The primary school is the need 
of all. Then let it be the affair of all. Fourcroy was mis- 
taken. Primary instruction became a reality in France only 
on the day when the State vigorously put its hand on it. 
On certain points, however, the law of 1802 prepared the 
way for the approaching creation of Napoleon; for example, 
in giving to the First Consul the appointment of the pro- 
fessors of the colleges, and in placing the primary schools 
under the supervision of the prefects. 
600. Founpation or tHe Universrry (1806).— The law 
of May 11, 1806, completed by the decrees of March 17, 
1808, and of 1811, established the University, that is, a 
teaching corporation, unique and entirely dependent on the 
State :— .

1 Foureroy (1758-1809), a celebrated chemist, was director-general of 
public instruction in 1801. He prepared, in the following years, the decree 
telative to the establishment of the University.
-P-A-G-E-541
EDUCATION IN THE NINETEENTH cunTURY. §11 
with instruction and public education throughout the whole 
extent of the Empire.” 
Instruction thus became a. function: of the State, on “the 
same basis as the administration of justioe or the organiza- 
tion of the army. 
At the sam2 time that it lost all autonomy, all indepen- 
dence, the University gained the formidable privilege of 
being alone charged with the national instruction. 
“No one can open a school or teach publicly, without 
being a member of the Imperial University and without hav- 
ing been graduated from one of its Faculties.” ‘* No schoel- 
can be established outside of the University, and without the 
authorization of its head.” : 
We know what protestations were excited, even on the 
start; by the establishment of this University monopoly. 
“It was not enough to enchain parents; it was still neces- 
sary to dispose of the children. Mothers have been seen 
hastening from the extremities of the Empire, coming to re- 
claim, in an agony of tears, the sons whom the government 
had carried off from them.’? Thus spoke Chateaubriand, 
before lavishing his adulations on the restorer of altars, and 
he added, with an extravagance of imagination which recoils 
on itself, ‘‘Children were placed in schools where they weré 
taught at the sound of the drum, irreligibn, debauchery, and 
eontempt for the domestic virtues!’ Joseph de Maistre 
was more just: ‘‘Fontanes,”! he. said, ‘*has large views 
and excellent intentions. The plan of his University is 
grand and comprehensive. It is a noble body. The soul 
will come to it when it can. Celibacy, subordination, devo- 
tion of the whole life without religious motive, are required. 
Will they be obtained? ”?

512 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
, 601. OrcanizaTION OF THE ImprRtaL’ Universiry. — The 
Imperial University comprised, like the present University, 
Colleges, Lycées, and Faculties. The Colleges furnished 
secondary instruction, like the Lycées, but less complete. 
There were a Faculty of Letters and a Faculty of Sciences 
for each academic centre; but these Faculties were very 
poorly equipped, with their endowment of from five to ten 
thousand francs at most, and with their few professors. The 
professors of the neighboring Lycée (professors of rhetoric 
and mathematics) formed a part of the establishment, and 
each Faculty included at most but two or three other chairs. 
. Latin and mathematics formed the basis of the instruction 
in the Lycées. The Revolution had not come in vain, since 
that which it had vigorously demanded was now realized ; 
the sciences and the classical languages weré put on a foot- 
ing of equality. 
.. 602. Dynastic Prerossessions. — That which’ absorbed 
the attention of the founder of the Imperial University was 
less the schemes of study than the general principles on 
which the rising generations were to be nourished. In this 
. Yespect the thought of the Emperor is not obscure. He does 
not dissemble it. God and the Emperor are the two words 
which must be graven into the depths of the soul. 
*¢ All the schools of the Imperial University will make as 
the basis of their instruction: 1. the precepts of the Catholic 
religion; 2. fidelity to the Emperor, to the imperial mon- 
archy, the depository of the happiness of the people, and to 
the Napoleonic dynasty, the conservator of the unity of 
France, and of all the ideas proclaimed by the Constitution.” 
“ Napoleon,” as Guizot says, ‘¢ attempted to convert into 
an instrument of despotism an institution which tended to 
be only a centre of light.”
-P-A-G-E-543
“EDUCATION IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY. 513 
. 603, Prrwary InstructION NEGLECTED.—Primary instruc- 
tion never occupied the attention of Napoleon I. ‘The decree’ 
of 1805'contented itself with promising measures intended to 
assure the recruitment of teachers, especially the creation of 
one or more normal classes within the colleges and lycées. 
Moreover, the Grand Master was to encourage and to license 
the Brethren of the Christian Schools, while supervising their 
establishments. Finally, the right to establish schools. was 
left to families or to religious corporations, the budget of the 
Empire containing no item of appropriation for the cause of 
popular instruction. 
The Restoration was scarcely more generous towards the 
instruction of the people. By the ordinance of February 29, 
1815, it granted jifty thousand francs as encouragement to the’ 
primary schools. Was this derisive liberality any better than 
complete silence and neglect? ‘A more important measure 
was the establishment of cantonal committees charged with 
the supervision of primary schools. These committees were 
placed, sometimes under the direction of the rector, and at 
others under the authority of the bishop, at the pleasure of 
the vicissitudes of politics. Certificates of qualification were 
delivered to the members of the authorized congregations, on ' 
the simple presentation of their letters of permission. We 
can imagine what a body of teachers could be assured by such 
a mode of recruitment. : 
In anticipation of the monarchy of July, which in its liberal 
dispositions was to appear more regardful of popular educa- 
tion, private initiative signalized itself under the Restoration 
by the foundation of the Society for Elementary. Instruction, 
and also by the encouragement it gave to the first attempts at 
mutual instruction. :

Bell and Lancaster, have claimed the honor of having in-

vented mutual instruction. The fact is; neither of them 
invented it; they simply gave it currency. It is in France, 
if not in India,‘that we must look for the real origin of 
mutual instruction. We have seen that Madame de Mainte- 
non, Rollin, La Salle, and Pestalozzi, practised it, and toa 
certain extent gave it currency. In the eighteenth century 
Herbault bad employed it in the hospital of La Pitié (1747), 
the Chevalier Paulet at Vincennes (1774), and, finally, the 
Abbé Gaulticr,! also a Frenchman, had introduced the use of 
it into London, in 1792, some years before Bell brought it 
from India. 
605. Bett (1753-1832) anp Lancaster (1778-1838).— 
Bell and Lancaster are none the ‘less the first authorized 
propagators of the mutual method, or, as the English say, of 
the monitorial system. Bell had used it at Madras, in imita- 
tion of the Hindoo teachers, and in 1798 he introduced it into 
England. But at the same period, a young English teacher, 
Lancaster, applied the same methods with success, and, so 
far as it appears, through a suggestion absolutely personal 
and original. Lancaster was a Quaker, and Bell a Church- 
man, so that public opinion in England was divided between 
the two rivals. The truth is that they had applied at the 
same time a system which was known before their day, and 
which must naturally have been suggested to all teachers who 
have too large a number of children to instruct, as a result 
of the inadequacy of their resources and the lack of a teaching 
force sufficiently large.

Paris till 1867, for a long time enjoyed an extraordinary 
credit in France. Under the Restoration, its success was so 
great that it became the fashion, and even a craze. Patron 
ized by the most eminent men of that day, by Royer-Collard, 
by Laisné, by the Duke Decazes, by the Duke Pasquier, 
mutual instruction became the flag of the liberal party in the 
matter of instruction. Political passions became involved in 
it. The new system came into competition with the tradi- 
tional instruction of the Brethren of the Christian Schools, 
and was fought and denounced as immoral by all the partisans 
of routine. ‘‘ Mutual instruction was charged with destroy- 
ing the foundation of social order by delegating to children 
a power which ought to belong only to men.... Men held 
for or against simultaneous instruction, its rival, as if it were 
@ question of an article of the Charter.” * . 
607. Morat Apvantaces. —The friends of mutual instruc- 
tion, in order to justify their enthusiasm, made the most of 
moral reasons. What can be more touching, they said, than 
to see children communicating to one another the little that 
they know? What an excellent lesson of charity and of 
mutual aid! The Gospel has said, Love one another. Was 
it not giving to the divine precept a happy tratslation to add, 
Instruct one another! An attempt was made, moreover, to 
introduce mutuality into discipline and into the repression 
of school faults. The school, on certain solemn occasions, 
was converted into a court for trying criminals. ‘‘ All this 
was done very seriously, and it was also very seriously felt 
that these practices, passing from a class of children to a 
class of adults, would contribute to introduce into society the 
habits of a true and useful fraternity.”

516 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
608. Economicat Apvantacss. —~To tell the truth, mu- 
tual instruction was above all elsé ‘‘a useful expedient,” 
according to Rollin’s expression. At a period when teachers 
were scarce, when the budget of public instruction did not 
exist, it was natural that an economic system which dispensed 
with teachers, and which reduced to almost nothing the cost 
of instruction, should be hailed with enthusiasm. Let us add 
that there was also an economy in books, since ‘there was 
need of only one book, which pupils never used, and which 
would thus last for several years.” 
Jomard calculated that there were 3,000,000 children to 
instruct, and that, according to the ordinary system, this 
would require the expenditure of more than 45,000,000 
francs.1 
Now, according to the calculations of the Comte de La- 
borde,? 1000 pupils being able to be educated by one single 
teacher, by the system of mutual instruction, more easily 
than 30 could have been by the old system, a sum of 10,000 
francs granted annually by the State would suffice to educate 
in twelve years the entire generation of poot children. 
609. Orcanization or ScHoors on THE Morvan Pian. — 
Bell defined mutual instruction as ‘“‘the method by means 
of which a whole school may instruct itself, under the super- 
vision of one single master.” 
Here is the picture of a mutual school, as deseribed by

long and vast structures which contained a whole school, 
such as the older generations of our teachers recollect still to 
have seen at the Halle aux Draps. In the middle of the 
room, throughout its entire length, were rows of tables hav- 
ing from ‘five to twenty places each, having at one end, at 
the right, the desk of the monitor, and the board having | 
models of writing, itself surmounted by a standard or tele- 
graph which served to secure, by means of directions easy to | 
read, regularity of movements ; at the side of the room, and 
all along the walls, there were rows of semi-circles, about 
which were arranged groups of children; on the walls, on a. 
line with the eye, there was a blackboard on which were 
performed the exercises in computation, and from. which 
were suspended the charts for reading and grammar; right 
at his side, within reach of his hand, was the stick with 
which the teacher was provided for conducting the lesson ; 
fintlly, at the lower part of the room, on a wide and high 
platform, accessible by steps and. surrounded by a balus- 
trade, was the chair of the master, who, employing in suc- 
cession, according to fixed rules, voice, ddton, or whistle, 
surveyed the tables and groups, distributing commendation or 
reproof, and directing, in a word, like a captain on the deck 
of his vessel, the whole machinery of instruction.” : 
In respect of systematic movements and exterior order, 
nothing is more charming than the appearance of a school 
conducted on the mutual plan. It remains to inquire what 
were the educational results of the system, and whether the 
fashion which brought it into favor was justified by real 
advantages,

rades, but too little instructed to be equal to his task. The - 
mutual school did not open till ten o’clock. From eight to 
ten there was a class for the monitors. There they learned 
in haste what they were, for the rest of the day, to teach to 
the other children. The purpose of the master being to form 
good instruments as quickly as possible, they were fitted up 
for their trade by the most expeditious methods. 
‘* What sort of teachers could such a preparation produce? 
To teach is to learn twice, it has been truly said; but on 
the condition of having reflected on that which has been 
Jearned and upon that which is to be taught. To convey light 
into the intelligence of another, it is first necessary to have 
produced the light within one’s self, a thing which supposes 
the enlightened, penetrating, and persevering action of a. 
mind relatively mature and trained. From the class where 
they have just been sitting as pupils, the monitors — mas- 
ters improvised as by the wave of a wand,— passed to 
the classes of children whom they were to indoctrinate” 
(Gréard). : 
The instruction, consequently, became purely mechanical. 
The monitor faithfully repeated what he had been taught. 
Everything was reduced to mechanical processes. 
Let us observe, besides, that from the moral point of 
view, the mutual system left much-to be desired. The mon- 
itors, we are told, did not escape the intoxications of 
' pride. Even in the family they became petty tyrants. 
Parents complained of their dictatorial habits and their tone 
of authority. 
However it may be, mutual instruction has rendered 
undeniable services, thanks to the zeal of such teachers as 
Mademoiselle Sauvan and Monsieur Sarazin; but its repu- 
tation went on diminishing in proportion as the State became

| more and more disposed to make sacrifices, and. as it was 
possible to multiply the services of teachers.* 
611. THe Sratz or Primary Instruction. — Under the 
title, Bahibit of Primary Instruction in France, a member of 
the University, P. Lorain, published in 1837 a résumé of the 
inquiry, which, by the orders of Guizot, had been made in 
1838 throughout the whole extent of France, by the labors 
of more than 400 inspectors. Here are some of the sad 
resulta of this inquiry: all the teachers did not know how to 
write; a large number employed the mechanism of the three 
fondemental rules without being able to give any theoretical. 
reason for these operations. ‘‘ The ignorance was general.” 
As under the old régime, the teacher practiced all. the 
trades;he was day-laborer, shoemaker, innkeeper. 
“He had his wife supply his place while he went hunting 
in the fields.” 
The functions of the teacher, poorly rewarded, exposed to 
the risk of a very slender tuition, enjoyed no consideration. 
“The teacher was often regarded in the community on 
the same footing as a mendicant, and between the herdsman 
and himself, the preference was for the herdsman.” 
Consequently, the situation of school-master was the most 
often sought after by men who were infirm, crippled, unfit 
for any other kind of work. 
“From the teacher without arms, to the epileptic, how 
many infirmities to pass through!”

really organized in France till by the law of June 28, 1833, 
the honor of which is due in particular to Guizot, then minis- 
ter. of public instruction.’ 
Primary instruction was divided into two grades, — elemen- 
tary and higher. Henceforth there was to be a school for 
each commune, or at least for each group of two or three 
communes. The State reserved the right of appointing 
teachers, and of determining their salary, which, it is true, 
in certain places, did not exceed two hundred francs. Poor 
children were to be received without pay. 
618. HigHer Primary Scuoors. — One of the most praise- 
worthy purposes of the legislator of 1833 was the establish- 
ment of higher primary instruction. 
‘* Higher primary instruction,” he said, ‘‘ necessarily in- 
cludes, in addition to all the branches of elementary primary 
instruction, the elements of geometry, and its common appli- 
cations, especially linear drawing and surveying, information 
on the physical sciences and natural history, applicable to 
the uses of life, singing, the elements of history and geog- 
raphy, and particularly of the history and geography of 
France. According to the needs and the resources of local- 
ities, the instruction shall receive such developments as shall 
be deemed proper.” 
A higher primary school was to be established in the chief 
towns of the department and in all the communes which had 
a population of more than six thousand souls. The law was 
executed in part. In 1841, one hundred and sixty-one 
schools were founded. But little by little, the indifference 
of the government, and, above all, the vanity of parents who 
preferred for their children worthless Latin studies to a good

normal des instituteurs.
-P-A-G-E-551
EDUCATION IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY. 521 
and thorough primary instruction, discouraged these first 
efforts. : 
The legislator of 1833 had good reason for thinking that a 
good vest was worth more than a poor coat. His mistake 
was in thinking that people would be persuaded to abandon 
the coat in order to take the vest.!_ The higher schools were 
almost everywhere annexed to the colleges of secondary in- 
struction. To suppress their independence and their own 
distinctive features was to destroy them. The final blow 
was given them by the law of 1850, which abstained from 
pronouncing their name, and which condemned them by its 
silence. on 
614. Crounar or Guizor. — In transmitting ‘to teachers 
the law of June 28, 1833, Guizot had it followed by a cele- 
brated circular, which eloquently stated the proper office of 
the teacher, his duties and his rights. Here are some pas- 
sages from it: 
“Do not make a mistake here, Sir. ‘While the career of 
primary instruction may be without renown, its duties inter- 
est the whole of society, and it is an occupation which shares 
the importance attached to public functions. ... Universal 
primary instruction is henceforth to be one of the guarantees 
of order and social stability.” 
The circular next examines the material advantages which 
the new law assured to teachers, and it continues thus: — .. 
“However, Sir, as I well know, the foresight of the law 
and the resources at the disposal of public authority, will 
never succeed in rendering the humble profession of a com- 
manal teacher as attractive as it is useful. Society could 
not reward him who devotes himself to this service for all 
that he does for it. There is no fortune to gain; there is 
  1 Cournot, Des institutions d’instruction publique, p. 315.

522 “THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
searcely any reputation to acquire in the difficult duties which 
he performs. Destined to see his life spent in a monotonous 
occupation, sometimes even to encounter about him the in- 
justice and the ingratitude of ignorance, he would often grow 
tlisheartened, and would perhaps succumb did he not draw 
his strength and his courage from other sources than from 
the prospect of an interest immediate and purely personal. 
It is necessary that a profound sense of the moral importance 
of his work sustain and animate him, and that the austere 
pleasure of having served men and secretly contributed to the 
public good, become the noble reward which his conscience 
alone can give. It is his glory to aim at nothing beyond his 
. obscure and laborious condition, to spend himself in sacri- 
fices scarcely counted by those who profit by them, and, in 
a word, to work for men and to look for his reward only 
from God.” 
615. Procress or Porcrar Insrrucrion. -— It would be 
an interesting history to relate in detail the progress of popu- 
lar education in France from the law of 1833 to our day. 
The public bills of the Republic of 1848, the liberal proposi- 
tions of Carnot and of Barthélemy Saint-Hilaire, the recoil 
of the law of March 15, 1850, the statu quo of the first years 
of the Second Empire, then towards the end the praiseworthy 
efforts and tentatives of Duruy, and, finally, under the Third 
Republic, the definite and triumphant organization, — all 
this is sufficiently known and too recent to justify us in 
dwelling on it here. 
For successfully introducing anew into the laws the princi- 
ples of gratuity, obligation, and secularization, as proclaimed 
by the French Revolution, not less than a century was neces- 
sary. And in particular, the better spirits allowed them- 
selves to be convinced of the a of ‘obligatory instruction’
-P-A-G-E-553
EDUCATION IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY. 523 
only.by ‘slaw degrees. However, in 1833, Cousin, who re+ 
ported the law of Guizot to the Chamber of Peers, expressed 
himself as follows : — 
‘A law which should make of primary instruction a legal 
obligation seems to me to be no more above the powers of 
the legislator than the law on the national guard, and that 
which you have just made on a forced appropriation for the 
public good. If reasons of public utility justify the legisla- 
tor in appropriating private property, why do not reasons of 
a much higher utility justify him in doing less, —in requir- 
ing that children receive the instruction indispensable to every 
human creature, to the end that he may not become danger- 
ous to himself or to society as a whole?” 
Cousin added that the commission of which he ‘was the 
chairman would not have receded from measures wisely com- 
bined to make instruction obligatory, had it not been afraid 
of provoking difficulties, and, in this way, of postponing a 
law that was awaited with impatience. The evident neces- 
‘sity of instructing the people, the interests of society, the 
interests of families and individuals, — all these considera- 
tions have. insensibly overcome the scruples or the illusions 
of a false liberality, and it is no longer necessary, to-day, to 
Yepeat the eloquent pleas of Carnot in his bill of 1848, of 
Duray, and of Jules Simon. 
In 1873 Guizot expressed himself as follows :— 
“The liberty of conscience and that of families are facts 
and rights which, in this question, ought to be serupulously re- 
spected and guaranteed ; but, under the condition of this 
respect and of these guarantees, it may happen that the state 
of society and the state of minds may render legal obligation, 
in respect of primary instruction, legitimate, salutary, and nec- 
essary. This is the condition of things to-day. The movement 
in favor.of obligatory instruction is sincere, serious, national.
-P-A-G-E-554
524 - [}HE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
Powerful examples authorize and encourage it. In Germany, 
in Switzerland, in Denmark, in most of the American States, 
primary instruction bas this character, and civilization has 
reaped excellent fruits from it. France and its government 
have reason to welcome this principle.” 
' 616. Programmes or Primary Instruction. — At the 
same time that primary instruction made progress by its ever- 
growing extension, and by the participation in it of a greater 
number of individuals, its programmes were also extended, 
and it is interesting to compare in this respect the different 
laws which have regulated the matter of instruction in our 
century. 
The law of 1833 said: ‘‘ Elementary primary instruction 
necessarily comprises moral and religious instruction, reading, 
writing, the elements of the French language and of compu- 
tation, the legal system of weights and measures.” © 
- The bill presented, June 30, 1848, by Carnot, minister of 
public instruction, expresses itself thus :— , 
“Primary instruction comprises: 1. reading, writing, the 
elements of the French language, the elements of computa- 
tion, the metric system, the measure of distances, elementary 
notions of the phenomena of nature, and the principal facts 
of agriculture and of industry, linear drawing, singing, 
elementary notions on the history and geography of France; 
2. a knowledge of the duties and the rights of man and 
citizen, the development of the sentiments of liberty, equality, 
and fraternity ; 3. the elementary rules of hygiene, and use- 
ful exercises in physical development.” 
‘<The religious instruction is given by the ministers of the 
different communions.”’ 
. According to the bill of Barthélemy Saint-Hilaire. (April 
10, 1849), elementary instruction for boys, necessarily com-
-P-A-G-E-555
EDUCATION IN THE NINETEENTH CHNTURY. §25 
prised ‘moral, religious, and civic instruction, reading, 
writing, the elements of the French language, the elements. 
of computation, the legal system of weights and measures,, 
linear drawing, elementary notions of agriculture.and of. 
hygiene, singing and gymnastic exercises. 
‘* According to the needs and resources of localities, ele- 
mentary primary instruction shall receive the developments 
which shall be thought proper, and shall comprise, in partio- 
ular, notions on the history and geography of France,” 
Finally,the law of March 15, 1850, is worded thus :— 
*¢ Art. 28. Primary instruction comprises moral and relig- 
ious instruction, reading, writing, the elements of the French 
language, computation, and the legal system of weights and 
measures. It may comprise in addition, arithmetic applied 
to practical operations, the elements of history and geogra- 
phy, notions of the physical sciences and of natural history 
applicable to the ordinary purposes of life, elementary in- 
struction on agriculture, trade, and hygiene, surveying, level- 
ing, linear drawing, singing and gymnastics.” 
Progress has especially consisted, since 1850, in rendering 
obligatory that which was simply optional. History, for 
example, did not become a subject of instruction till 1867. 
617. Tue Tueortsts or Epvucarion. — Along with the 
progress of primary instruction, the historian of the peda- 
gogy of the nineteenth century would have also to follow the 
development of secondary instruction and of superior in- 
struction. He would have to write the history of the Univer- 
sity, reforming the methods of its lycées and its colleges, and 
ever enlarging in a noble spirit of liberty the studies of its 
faculties. But we should depart from the limits of our plan, 
were we to undertake this order of inquiries, and were we to 
enter into details which pertain to contemporary history.
-P-A-G-E-556
526 . THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
That which should engage our attention is the theoretical 
reflections of the different thinkers who, in our century, have 
discussed the principies and the laws of education, of those 
at least who have become celebrated for their novel views. 
618. Jacoror (1770-1840). — Jacotot, who has maintained 
acarcely any celebrity in France except for the singularity of 
his paradoxes, is perhaps of all French educators of the 
nineteenth century the one who has received most attention 
abroad, particularly in Germany. ‘‘Jacotot,” says Doctor 
Dittes, ‘‘ has incited a lasting improvement in the public in- 
struction of Germany. The reform which he introduced into 
the teaching of reading is important. He started with an 
entire sentence, which was pronounced, explained, and learned 
by heart by the children, and afterward analyzed into its 
constituent parts.”' On the other hand, a French critic, 
Bernard Perez, has drawn the foliowing portrait of Jacotot : — 
‘¢ He was the best and the most lovable of men. He had 
the firmness, patience, honesty, and candor of superior minds, 
an inexhaustible goodness and a universal charity which 
make him close all his letters with this formula, ‘I espe- 
cially commend to you the poor.’ This ardent philanthropy, 
as well as his enthusiasm and his zeal for instruction, per- 
vades even his writings, though full of inequalities and 
verbal eccentricities.” * 
619. Parapoxrs or Jacotor.—In his principal work, 
Universal Instruction,? Jacotot has set forth his principles, 
which are so many paradoxes, ‘‘ All intelligences are equal” ; 
“ Every man can teach, and even teach that which he him-

self does not know ”; ‘‘ One can instruct himself all alone ” ; 
“ Allis in all.” . 
Doubtless at the basis of Jacotot’s paradoxes there is an 
element of: truth; for example, the very just idea that the 
best teaching is that which encourages young minds to think 
for themselves. Doubtless also he qualified the exaggera- 
tion of his statement when he said that the inequality of 
wills at once destroys the equality of intelligences. But the 
violent and unreasonable form which he gave to his ideas 
has compromised them in public opinion. That which is 
true and fruitful in his system has been forgotten, and we 
recall only the whimsical formulas in which he delighted. 
620. Att 1s In AtL.—The most famous of Jacotot’s 
paradoxes is the formula, ‘ All is in all.” The whole of 
Latin is in a page of Latin; the whole of music is in a piece 
of music; the whole of arithmetic, in a rule of computation. 
In practice, Jacotot made his pupils learn the first six 
books of the Telemachus. Upon this text, once learned, 
and recited twice a week, there were constructed all sorts of 
exercises, and these sufficed for the complete knowledge of 
the French language. In the same way the Epitome His- 
torie Sacre, put in the hands of pupils, and learned in 
two months, was almost the sole instrument for the study of 
Latin. In fact, and aside from evident exaggerations, 
Jacotot rightly thought that it is necessary, as he said, “‘ to 
learn something well, and to connect with this all the rest.” 
621. Tue Fottowers or Saint Smmon AnD or Fourter. — 
There is little of practical value to be gathered from the writ- 
ings of the celebrated utopists, who, at the opening of this 
century, became known by their plans of social organization. 
It is the chimerical which characterizes their systems. Cabet 
demanded among other absurdities that all ancient books be

burned, and that no new books be written“excépt by com 
“mand of the State. Besides, he would have the school-code 
established by the children themselves." : 
Victor Consedérant suppressed, not books, ‘but disciplhin: 
and authority. ‘‘ The child,” he said, ‘ shall‘no longer be 
disobedient, because he shall no longer be commanded.”? # 
. Saint Simon, in 1816, communicated to the Society for 
Elementary Instruction, a brief essay which gave proof of bis 
interest in education. For him and his disciples; education 
is “‘ the aggregate of efforts to be employed in order to adapt 
each new generation to the social order to which it is called 
by the march of humanity.” This was to mark the contrast 
between modern tendencies which aspire above all else to an 
earthly and a social end, with ancient tendencies. which were 
subservient to supernatural ideas, Zisthetic sentiments, 
Scientific methods, industrial activity, — such is the triple 
development which special and professional education should 
consider. But above this the Saint-Simonians. place moral 
education, too much neglected, as they think, which should 
consist particularly in developing in the young the sympa- 
thetic and affectionate faculties. The Saint-Simonians placed 
but little dependence on science and abstract principles for 
assuring among men the reign of morality. Sentiment, in 
their view, is the true moral principle, and education, conse- 
quently, ought to be essentially the education of the heart. 
622. Fourter (1772-1837).— Fourier, like Saint Simon, 
had educational pretensions. There is nothing more curious 
than his treatise on Natural Education. In it there is only 
here and there a flash of good sense mingled with a multi- 
tude of grotesque fancies.

Fourier renews the utopias of Plato,.and confides infants: 
to public nurses. He is more reasonable when, in spite of», 
his declamations on the excellence of nature, he is really _ 
willing to recognize in children a diversity of characters, and 
divides ‘the nurslings and the babies” into three classes, — 
“the benign, the malign, and the devilkins.” 
We must also commend Fourier for his. efforts to encour~ 
age industrial activity. There is perhaps a valuable hint in: 
those walks which he recommends children to take through 
manufactories and shops, so that at the sight of such or suchy

employing destructive and slovenly children: in occupations 
in accord with their tastes; for example, in the pursuit of 
reptiles, and in the cleansing of sewers. 
But it is useless to enter into longer details. The education 
of the Fourierites is neither a discipline nor a rule of life ; it is 
simply a system of complaisant adherence, and even of ardent 
provocation, to the instincts which the child inherits from 
nature. It is no longer a question either of directing or of . 
training ; it is simply necessary to emancipate and to excite.   
   
623. Aucuste ComTe (1798-1857) anv Tux Posrrivists. — 
The positivist school, and its illustrious founder, Auguste 
Comte, could not omit, in their encyclopsedic works, a ques- 
tion so important as that of education. The author of the 
Course in Positive Philosophy had even announced a special 
treatise on pedagogy, ‘‘a great subject,” he said, ‘* which 
has not yet been undertaken in a manner sufficiently system- 
atic.”' The promise was not kept, but from different pas-

620. THE HISTORY. OF PEDAGOGY. - 
sages in the writings of Auguste Comte it is possible to re 
construct, in its principal features, the education which would 
be derived from his system. 
Comte took for his guide the natural and specific evolution 
of humanity. 
“Individual education can be adequately estimated only 
according to its necessary conformity with collective evo- 
lution.” 
As positivism represents, in the view of Comte, the su- 
preme degree of the evolution of humanity, the new education 
ought to be positive. . 
_ * Right-minded men universally recognize the necessity of 
replacing our European education, a system essentially theo- 
logical, metaphysical, and literary, by a positive education, 
conformed to the spirit of our epoch, and adapted to the 
needs of modern civilization.” 
’ The teaching of science, then, shall be the basis of educa- 
tion; but this teaching will bear its fruits only on one con- 
dition, and this is, that at last we renounce ‘‘ the exclusive 
specialty, the too pronounced isolation, which still charac- 
terizes our manner of conceiving and cultivating the sciences.” 
The precise purpose of the Course in Positive Philosophy was 
to remedy the deleterious influence of a too great specializa- 
tion of research, by establishing the relations and the hie- 
rarchy of the sciences. Comte made of mathematics the 
point of departure in scientific instruction. This was the 
very reverse of the modern tendency, which consists in begin- 
ning with the concrete and physical studies. 
Auguste Comte, in his project for social reform, demanded 
universal instruction, and he bitterly complains of the indif- 
ference of the ruling classes for the instruction of the poor. 
‘Nothing is more profoundly characteristic of the exist- 
ing anarchy than the shameful indifference with which the
-P-A-G-E-561
EDUCATION IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY. 531 
higher classes of to-day habitually'regard. the total absence 
of popular education, the exaggerated prolongation of which, 
however, threatens to exert on their approaching destiny a 
frightful reaction.” 
Comte does not go so far, however, as to dream of an 
identical education for all men, an integral education, as it 
has been called. He admits degrees in instruction, “‘ which,” 
he says, ‘‘ will allow varieties of extension in a system con- 
stantly similar and identical.” : 
624, Durantovr (1803-1878). — Of all the ecclestastical 
writers of our century, he who has the most ardently studied 
the problems of education is certainly Bishop Dupanloup, 
Important works give proof of the educational zeal of the 
eloquent prelate. But they were composed with more spirit 
than wisdom, and they betray the zeal of the Christian 
apologist. more than the inspiration of an impartial love for 
the truth. Extravagances of language and exaggerations 
of thought too often prevent the reader from feeling, as he 
ought, the moral and religious inspiration out of which pro- 
ceeded those books of ardent and profound faith, but of faith 
more than of charity. Notwithstanding their length and 
their vast proportions, these books are pamphlets, works of 
combat. One should be on his guard against taking them 
for scientific treatises. Serenity is lacking in them, and from 
the very first, we feel ourselves enveloped in an atmosphere 
of trouble and storm. 
625. Anatysis or THE TREATISE oN Epucation. — How- 
ever, the three volumes of the Education will be read with 
profit. The first volume treats of education in general, and 
contains three books. In the first book the author determines 
the character of education, which has for its purpose to cultt- 
vate the faculties, to eercise them, to develop them, to
-P-A-G-E-562
632 ' | THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
strengthen them, and, finally, to polish them. In the following 
books the author studies the nature of the child, of whom he 
sometimes speaks with a touching tenderness ; and examines 
the means of education, which are *‘ religion, instruction, 
discipline, and physical culture.” Discipline consists in sup- 
porting, preventing, and repressing. Discipline is to educa- 
tion ‘“‘ that which the bark is to the tree which it surrounds. 
It is the bark which holds the sap, and forces it to ascend to 
the heart of the tree.” 
The general title of the second volume is, On Authority 
and Respect in Education. Authority and respect, in the 
eyes of the author, are the two fundamental things. From 
this point of view, he studies what he calls the personnel of 
education ; that is, God, the parents, the teacher, the child, 
and the schoolmate. : 
The third volume, entitled Hducational Men, treats of the 
qualities befitting the head master of an educational estab- 
lishment, and of his different colleagues.? 
626. Errors anp Presupices. — Although he wrote a 
beautiful chapter entitled, Of the Respect due the Dignity of 
the Child and the Liberty of his Nature, Dupanloup is’ still 
more struck with the faults than with the virtues of child- 
hood. He shudders in thinking of his thoughtlessness, of 
his curiosity, of his sensuality, and especially of his pride. 
So he distrusts commendation and rewards. 
*«Tn praising your pupils,” he says to the teacher, ‘‘ do you 
not fear to excite their pride? The pride of scholars is a 
terrible evil; it begins in the ‘ third,’ develops in the ‘ sec- 
ond,’ blossoms in ‘rhetoric,’ and becomes established in 
* philosophy.’ ”?

To: this mistrust of human. nature.is joined a singular 
pessimism with respect to the functions of the teacher.

troubles. Sometimes, if we are worthy of this service, if we 
sacrifice ourselves to it, we can find consolations in it, but 
pleasure, never!” 
The verdict is severe and absolute, but it recoils i in part on 
him who pronounces it. How not mistrust an educator who 
declares that there is no sweetness mingled with the fatigues 
of teaching, and who condemns the teachers of youth to a 
life of complete sacrifice and bitterness? 
The greatest fault in the educational spirit of Dopasiloup 
is that he does not cross the narrow limits of an education in 
small seminaries. Dupanloup wrote only. for the middle 
classes. He had no interest in popular education ; he does 
not love the lay teacher ; he detests the University: Finally, 
he is the man who inspired the law of May 15, 1850.

— The philosophers of the French spiritualistic school have 
not in general paid great attention to the theory of education. 
The most illustrious of them, Cousin (1792-1868), at the 
same time that he aided in organizing University instruction, 
carefully studied educational institutions abroad, especially 
in his two works, Public Instruction in Holland (1887), and 
Public Instruction in Germany (1840). The works of Jules 
Simon have the same practical character, but with a marked 
tendency to treat by preference the questions of primary 
instruction. The School (1864) is a manifesto in favor of 
gratuity and obligation. . 
The University men, on their part, have, in this century, 
acted rather than speculated. They have been intent rather 
on making good pupils than on composing thcories. There

would, however, be valuable truths to cull fram the works of 
Cournot,! of Bersot,? and especially of Michel Bréal.* 
[628. AnaryticaL Summary. —1. One of the main charac- 
teristics of the educational ‘thought of this century is doubtless 
the effort to.deduce the rules of practice from certain first 
principles. The principles of instruction are to be found, for 
the most part, in the science of psychology, and the principles 
of education, in part, in social science and even in jurispru- 
dence. 
2. The purpose of Napoleon to secure the perpetuity of his 
dynasty through the influence of his Imperial University, is 
a striking proof of the belief in the potency of ideas, and of 
the belief in the potency of popular instruction as a means 
of national strength. 
8. The history of mutual instruction exhibits three impor- 
tant facts: 1. the effect of agitation in arousing public inter- 
est in educational questions ; 2. the manner in which peculiar 
circumstances suggest an expedient which can be justified on 
no absolute grounds; 3. the danger of converting such an 
expedient into a ‘‘system” for universal adoption. 
4. Comenius, Pestalozzi, and Jacotot, attempted to make 
instruction universal by simplifying its processes to such a 
degree that every mother might be a teacher and every house- 
hold a school. 
5. In Comte’ we see the re-appearance of Condillac’s doc- 
trine, that the historic education of the race is the type of 
individual education. The same hypothesis will re-appear in 
Mr. Spencer’s Education.]

629. Tae Science or Epucation.'— To-day, ‘thanks to 
important works, the science of education is no longer ‘ah 
empty term, an object of vague aspirations for philosophers, 
of easy ridicule for wits. Doubtless it is far ffom being 
definitely established ; but it no longer conceals its name 
and its pretensions ; it defines its purpose ‘snd its methods 5 
and manifests its youthful vitality in all directions. 
Up to the present period, philosophers had scarcely thought 
of organizing pedagogy, of ‘constructing it on a ratighal

basis. On the other hand, the practice of education is still 
less advanced: than the conceptions of philosophers. Here 
we the more often follow a thoughtless routine, or the vague 
inspirations of instinct. The methods in use are not co- 
ordinated. They present a curious mixture of old traditions 
and modern surcharges. It is this lack of definiteness, of 
co-ordination of ideas, and the spectacle of these contradic- 
tions, which caused Richter! to say: ‘* The education of the 
day resembles the Harlequin of the Italian comedy who comes 
on the stage with a bundle of papers under each arm. 
“What do you carry under your right arm?’ he is asked. 
‘Orders,’ he replies. ‘And under your left arm?’ ‘Counter- 
orders !’” : 
Quite a number of the philosophers of the nineteenth cen- 
tury have attempted to remedy this incoherence, and, by 
appealing to the scientific spirit, to regulate educational 
processes that have fallen into excesses of empiricism or of 
‘routine. It is these attempts which we are summarily to 
recite. 
630. Tue German PattosorHers.—Since Kant, and by 
his example, the most of German philosophers have asso- 
ciated the theory of education with their speculations on 
human nature. 
Fichte (1762-1814), in his Discourse to the German Na- 
tion, proclaimed the necessity of a national education tc 
secure the regeneration of his country and its restoration to 
its former standing. The advocate of a public and common 
education, because he would fight against the selfishness 
which family life encourages, he contributed by his eloquent 
1 J.P. Richter, better known under the name Jean Paul (1763-1825), the 
author of @ spirited and scholarly book, Levana, or the Doctrine of Educa- 
tion, 1803.
-P-A-G-E-567
THE SCIENCE OF EDUCATION. 587 
appeals to restore the intellectual and moral grandeur, and 
consequently, the material grandeur, of Germany. 
Schleiermacher (1768-1834) wrote a Doctrine of Eauea- 
tion, which was not published till 1849. In this he develops, 
among other ideas, this proposition, that religious education 
does not belong to the school, but that it is the affair of the 
family and the Church. 
’ Herbart (1776-1841) has composed a series of pedagogi- 
cal writings which assign him a special place in the list of 
educational philosophers. Let us call attention, in particular, 
to his General Pedagogy (1806), and the Outline of my Les- 
sons on Pedagogy (1840). That which distinguishes Her- 
part is his attempt to reduce to a system all the rules of 
pedagogy by giving them for a basis his own psychological 
theory. He inaugurated a new method in psychology, which 
does not seem, however, to have given the results that were 
expected from it, —the mathematical method. For him, psy- 
chology is only the mechanism of the mind, and by means of 
mathematical formula calculation may be applied to measure 
the force of ideas. The soul does not possess innate facul- 
ties ; it is developed progressively. 
But it would require long efforts to enter into the secrets: 
of Herbart’s original thought. Let it suffice to say, that 
nurtured from an early period on the ideas of Pestalozzi, 
whose friend he was, he has founded a real school of 
pedagogy. Beneke (1798-1854) is the author of a, Doctrine of Educa 
tion and Instruction, which is, in the opinion of Doctor 
Dittes, a masterpiece of psychological pedagogy. Beneke 
agrees with Herbart on a great number of points. His © 
pedagogical methods have been popularized by J. G. Dressler, 
director of the normal school at Bauzen, who died in 1860. -

ion, 1871).
-P-A-G-E-568
ore 538 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
Charles Schmidt, who died in 1864, wrote a large number 
of works on pedagogy, in which he is inspired by the: phre- 
nology of Gall and his fantastical hypotheses. Doubtless 
this inspiration is not happy, and the works of Schmidt are 
more valuable for their details, for their special reflections, 
than for their general doctrine. But from his undertaking 
there issues at least this truth, that the science of education 
should have for its basis, not only psychology, but physiol- 
ogy also, the science of the whole man, body and mind. 
. There is no country where pedagogy has received a more 
philosophical and a higher development than in Germany. 
Even the great poets, Lessing, Herder, Goethe, and Schiller, 
have contributed through certain grand ideas to the construc- 
tion of a science of education. 
631. Tus Eneuisu Purosopurrs. —English philosophy, 
with its experimental and practical character, and with its 
positive and utilitarian tendencies, was naturally called to 
exercise a great influence on pedagogy. There are more 
truths to gather from the thinkers who, in different degrees, 
have followed Locke and Bain, and who ‘have preserved a 
taste for prudent observation and careful experiments, than 
from the German idealists, enamored of hypothesis and sys- 
tematic constructions. 
Without doubt this explains the considerable success which 
the recent books of Herbert Spencer and Alexander Bain 
have obtained even in France. 
682. Tus Boox or Herzert Spencer. — If it were sufii- 
cient to define with exactness the end to be attained, and to 
discover the true method for constructing the science, Her- 
bert Spencer’s book on Education, Intellectual, Moral, and 
Physical,) would be a satisfactory treatise ; but it is one thing 
    
1 The first French translation appeared in 1878

to comprehend that psychology ‘is the only solid basis of a 
complete and exact pedagogy, and another thing to deter- 
mine the real laws of psychology. 
¢¢ Education will not be definitely systematized,” says Mr. 
Spencer, “ till the day when science shall be in possession of 
a rational psychology.” 
This day has not yet come, and Herbert Spencer, who is 
the first to recognize the fact, modestly presents his work 
only aganessay. But if it does not yet contain a perfect 
and fully worked out theory of education, the essay of the 
English philosopher is at least 2 vigorous effort, and a nota- 
ble step towards a rational pedagogy, towards the science of 
education, which, as Virchow expresses it, ‘‘ ought forever 
to proscribe the gropings of an ignorant education whose 
experiments are ever to be gone over anew.” 
633. Puan of THE Worx. — Every system of education 
supposes at the same time an ethics, —I mean a certain con- 
ception of‘ life and of human destiny, and a psychology, — 
that is, a knowledge more or less exact of our faculties and 
of the laws which preside over their development. There are, 
in fact, in education, two essential questions: 1. What are 
the subjects of study and instruction, proper to create the 
qualities, the aggregate of which constitutes the type of the 
well-educated man? 2. By what methods shall we teach 
the child rapidly and well that which it is proper for him to 
learn? There are, in other terms, the question of end and 
the question of means. Ethics is necessary to resolve the 
first, and psychology, to illustrate the second. 
It is in accordance with this plan that Mr. Spencer has . 
arranged the different parts of his work. | The first chapter, 
entitled What Knowledge is of Most Worth? is in substance 
but a series of reflections on the final purpose, on the differ-.
-P-A-G-E-570
640 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
ent forms, of human activity, and, consequently, on the rela 
tive importance, on the rank, which should be assigned to 
the studies which go to compose a complete education. 
In the three other chapters, Intellectual, Moral, and Phy- 
sical Education, the author examines the methods which are 
deemed the best for instructing the intelligence, perfecting 
the moral character, and fortifying the body. 
634. Drrrnrtion or Epucation. —Herbert Spencer begins 
with a definition of education : — 
+‘ Education,” he says, ‘‘is all that we do for ourselves, 
and all that others do for us, forthe purpose of bringing us 
nearer the perfection of our nature.... The ideal of edu- 
cation would be to furnish man with a complete preparation. 
fcr life as a whole.... Do not attempt to give an exclu- 
sive development of one order of knowledge at the expense 
of the rest, however important it may be. Let us distribute 
our attention over the whole, and justly proportion our efforts 
to their relative value. ... In general, the object of educa- 
tion ought to be to acquire as completely as possible the 
‘knowledge that is best adapted to develop individual and 
social life under all its aspects, and to do no more than 
glance at the subjects which contribute the least to this 
development.” ? 
This definition is wrong in being a little pretentious and 
in not adapting itself to all the forms of education. It is 
true, perhaps, if it is a question of the ideal to be attained in 
a complete instruction, accessible to a few privileged men, 
but it could not be applied to popular education. It soars 
too high above human conditions and social realities. 
  
1 In this, as in several other instances, Monsieur Compayré gives a sum: 
mary of the author’s thought rather than an exact quotation. (P.)
-P-A-G-E-571
   THE SCIENCE OF mpodamnons 841 
685, Human Desriny.—The conception 'of hunian destiny,” 
as Mr. Spencer outlines it in the opéning of ‘his ‘book, has 
very marked utilitarian tendencies.’ ‘His. ‘first complaint 
against the current education is that it sacrifices the useful 
to the agreeable; that as matters now go, everything which 
pertains to mental adornment and display has: precedence 
over the knowledge which might increasé’ our well-being and 
assure our happiness. As in the history of dress, with 
savages for example, it is proved that the ornamental in 
dress precedes the useful; so in instruction, ornamental 
studies are preferred to useful studies. This is especially’ 
the case with women, who have a decided preference for ft: : 
qualities of pure decoration. : one 
In his rather vigorous reaction against the luxuries which 
in classical instruction would wrongly substitute’ themselves 
for more necessary studies, Mr. Spencer goes so far as to 
say:— 
‘* Just as the Orinoco Indian paints and tattooes himself, 
so the child in this country learns Latin because it forms a 
part of the education of a gentleman.” 
However, we do not construe this literally. Mr. Spencer 
does not go so far as to suppress the disinterested studies’ 
which are as much the more necessary as they seem to be' 
the more superfluous. He merely demands that instructioi 
be not reduced to a training in the trivial elegancies of a 
dead language, or to a study of trifles in history, such as the 
dates of battles, and the birth and death of princes. 
686. Urruirartan TENDENCIES. — Utility, that is, the influ- 
ence on happiness, — such is the true criterion hy which are _ 
    1 As, historically, ornament precedes dress, on Mr. Spencer’s main prin-* 
tiple, it need not be till late in life that women dress sensibly, Or ought nor

tis of dress-in the race? (P.)
-P-A-G-E-572
542 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
to be estimated, admitted or excluded, and finally classified, 
the subjects proposed for the study of man as the elements 
of his education. It is understood, however, that happiness 
is to be considered in its widest and highest sense. Happi- 
ness does not consist in the satisfaction of such or such a 
privileged inclination. It consists in being all that it is 
possible to be, —in complete living. To prepare us for a 
complete life, — such is the function of education. 
637. Dirrerent Catecories or Activity. — Complete life 
supposes different kinds of activity, which ought to be subor- 
dinated one to another according to their importance and 
dignity. The following statement shows how Mr. Spencer 
proposes to classify these different categories of activities 
according to an ascending scale of progress : —~ 
1. In the first rank is placed the activity which ministers 
simply to self-preservation. It would be of no consequence 
to be an eminent scholar, or a citizen and a patriot, or a 
devoted father; or rather, all this would be impossible, if 
one did not first know how to assure his safety and his life. 
2. Then comes the series of activities which tend indirectly 
to the same end of physical well-being, by the acquisition 
and production of the material goods necessary for existence, 
that is, industry and the different occupations. 
3. In the third place, man employs his activities in the 
service of his family,—he has children to support and tc 
bring up. 
4, Social and political life is the fourth object of his 
efforts. This supposes, as a previous condition, the accom- 
plishment of family duties, just as family life itself supposes 
the normal development of the individual life. 
5. Finally, human existence is consummated and crowned, 
so to speak, in the exercise of the activities which, in a single
-P-A-G-E-573
THE SCIENCE OF EDUCATION. | 543 
word, we might call esthetic, and which, taking ‘advantage 
of the leisure left from care and business, will find satisfac- 
tion in the culture of letters and the arts. 
688. Criticism oF tu1s CLassiFicaTion. ~— What excep- 
tions can be taken to this exact and methodical table of the 
different elements of an existence complete, normal, and 
consequently human? Is it necessary to remark that the 
happiness thus understood does not differ from what we call 
virtue? None of the five elements distinguished by Mr. 
Spencer can be safely omitted. The first could not be 
neglected without endangering the material reality of life; 
nor the last, without impairing its moral dignity. In some 
degree they are mutually necessary, in this sense, that the 
lower, or selfish activities, are the conditions which make 
possible the other parts of human duty ; and that the higher, 
or disinterested activities, become, as it were, the justifica- 
tion of the toil we endure in order to exist and to satisfy 
material necessities. 
We have, however, one grave reserve to make. Myr. 
Spencer is wrong in putting into the last category of activi- 
ties that which is the crown of the others, all that which con- 
cerns the moral development of the individual. Between the 
second and the third class of activities we ask to interpolate | 
another form of activity, —that which constitutes the indi- 
vidual moral life, that which, in every man, even the humblest 
and the poorest, calls into exercise the conscience, the rea- 
son, and the will. Mr. Spencer’s system is decidedly too 
aristocratic. It seems to reserve the moral life for men of 
leisure. In a democratic society, which believes in equality 
and which would not have this an empty term, there are ef- 
forts which must be made for the moral development of the 
human’ being in all conditions, and it would be wrong to
-P-A-G-E-574
644 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
reduce personal activity to the care of # heslth and material 
well-being. 
639. Errects on Epucation.—It is now easy to com- 
prehend the duties of education. Conforming its efforts to 
nature, distributing its lessons according to the exact divis- 
jon of human functions, it will seek the branches of knowl- 
edge the most fit for making of the pupil, first, a sound and 
healthy man, then a toiler, a workman, — a man, in a-word, 
capable of earning his livelihood ; then it will train’ him for 
the family and the State, by endowing him with all the 
domestic and civic virtues; finally, it will open to him the 
brilliant domain of art under all its forms. 
640. Science 1s tHe Basts of Epucation.— When we 
have once divided human life into a certain number of super- 
‘imposed stages which education should teach us to ascend 
one after another, it becomes necessary to know what are the 
facts and the branches of knowledge which correspond to 
each one of these different steps. To this question Mr. 
Spencer ‘eplies that in all the grades of human development 
that which is pre-eminently necessary, that which is the basis 
of education, is science. 
641. Science ror Hearru anp InpustRraL Activity. — 
“It is in the first part of education, that which has for its object 
self-preservation, that science is the least useful. So far, 
education may be in great part negative, because nature has 
taken it upon herself to lead us to our destination. The 
child cries at the sight of a stranger, and throws himself 
into the arms of his mother when he feels the slightest sor- 
row. However, in proportion to his growth, man has more 
and more need of science, and he could not do without physi- 
ology and hygiene. By this means will he shun all those

THE SCIENCE OF EDUCATION: 
  little acts of imprudence, all those “physival ‘faults, which 
shorten life, or pave the way for infirmities in- old age. By 
this means he will diminish the interval, ‘which’ is so consid- 
erable, between the length of life as:it- might be and the - 
brevity of life as itis. Evident truths, but’ too often un- 
heeded ! 
‘“‘How many scholars,” exclaims “MesSpencer, «who 
would blush if caught saying Iphigénia instead of Iphigenia, 
show not the slightest shame in confessing that they do not 
know where the Eustachian tubes are, and neha are: the 
actions of the spinal cord!” 
- ‘With respect to the activities -which might be “e¢alled Juera~ 
tive, and to the kind of instruction which they require, Mr. 
Spefcer still shows the utility of science. He knows how 
great a disposition there is in modern society to promote pro~ 
fessional or industrial instruction ; but he thinks, not without 
reason, that we do not proceed as we should ‘in order to be 
completely successful in this direction. All the sciences, 
mathematics through its applications to the arts, mechanics. 
through its connection with industries where machines play 
so great a part, physics and chemistry through the knowledge 
they furnish on matter and its properties, even the social 
sciences by reason of the relations of commerce with poli- 
| ties, —all the sciences, in a word, contribute to develop the 
skill and the prudence of the man who is employed in any 
trade or occupation whatever. 
642. Sorence ror Fammty Lire.— A point in which the 
originality of Mr. Spencer’s thought is distinctly marked, 
and which he develops with an eloquent earnestness, is the 
necessity of enlightening parents, and particularly mothers, 
‘upon their obligations and duties, and of putting them 
ha condition to direct the education of their children by 
 
-P-A-G-E-576
  546 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
    
       teaching them the natural laws of body-and: minds: ‘Is it 
not monstrous,” he says, ‘‘ that the. fate of a :new! genera- 
tion should be left to the chances of unreasoningcustom, 
. impulse, fancy, — joined with the suggestions. of ignorant 
nurses and the prejudiced counsel of grandmothers. ... 
In the actual state of things the best instruction even 
among the favored by fortune, is searcely more than an 
instruction of celibates.” We are ever saying that.the voca- 
tion of. woman is to bring up her children, and yet we teach 
her nothing of that which she ought to know in order to ful- 
fill worthily this great task. Ignorant as she. is ‘of’ the laws 
of life and of the phenomena of the soul, knowing nothing 
of the nature of the moral emotions or of physical disorders, 
her intervention in the education of the child is ‘often more 
disastrous than her absolute inaction would be. 
- 643. Science in AisTHETIC Epvucation. — Mr. , Spencer 
next shows that social and political activity also has need of 
being enlighteried by science. One is a citizen ‘only on the 
condition of knowing the history of his country. 
That which it is more difficult to grant Mr. Spencer, is 
that esthetic education, in its turn, is based on science. Is 
there ‘not some exaggeration, for example, in asserting that 
poor: musical compositions are poor because they are lack- 
ing in truth? and that they are lacking in truth ‘*because 
they are lacking in science”? Does one become aman of 
letters and an artist as one becomes a geometrician ? To 
cultivate with success those arts which are as the flower of 
civilization, is there not required, besides talent and natural 
gifts, a long practice, a slow initiation, something, in a 
word, more delicate than the attention which suffices for 
being instructed in science? 
644. ExaGGERaTIONS AND Presupices. — We believe as 
thoroughly as any one can in the efficiency and in the educa-
-P-A-G-E-577
THE SCIENCE OF EDUCATION. 547 
tional virtues of science, and we would willingly make it, as 
Mr. Spencer does, the basis.of education. We must be on 
our guard, however, against cultivating. this religion of 
science until it becomes a superstition. Our author is not 
completely exempt from this danger. 
That science develops the intellectual qualities, such as 
judgment, memory, reasoning, we admit; that it develops, 
them better than the study of the languages, let even this be 
granted! But it is impossible for us not to protest when Mr. 
Spencer represents science as endowed with the same efficacy 
for inspiring moral qualities, such as perseverance, sincerity, 
activity, resignation to the will of nature, piety even, and 
religion. Science appears to us an infallible means of ani- 
mating and exciting the different energies of the soul; but 
will it also have the quality of disciplining them? Thanks 
to science, man will know that which it is proper to do, if he 
wishes to be a workman, a parent, or a citizen, but on this 
express condition, that he wills; and this education of the 
will, is it still science which shall be charged with it? We 
may be allowed to doubt it. 
Mr. Spencer himself now seems to share this doubt, if we 
may trust one of his recent works.! ‘ Faith in books and in 
nature,” it is there said, ‘‘ is one of the superstitions of our 
times.” We deceive ourselves, says the author, when we 
establish a connection between the intelligence and the-will, 
for conduct is determined not by knowledge but by emo- 
tion. 
‘*He who would hope to teach geometry by giving lessons 
in Latin, would scarcely be more unreasonable than those 
who count on producing better sentiments by means of a dis 
cipline of the intellectual faculties.” .

-P-A-G-E-578
548 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
To tell the truth, Mr. Spencer has here fallen into another 
extreme, and he seems to us at one time to have granted too 
much, and at another too little, to the influence of instruction 
on morality. 
645. InreLLecrcaL Epucation. —So far we have exam- 
ined along with Mr. Spencer only the nature of the objects 
and of the knowledge which befit the education of man. It 
remains to inquire how the mind can assimilate this knowl- 
edge. Pedagogy has not only to draw up in theory a bril- 
liant programme of necessary studies, but it also searches 
out the means and the methods to be employed, in order that 
these studies may be presented to the mind, and may have 
the greater chance of being thus presented with profit. 
In this somewhat more practical part of his work, Mr. 
Spencer thinks that pedagogy should be guided by the idea 
of evolution; that is, of the progressive course of a being 
' who makes himself, who creates himself little by little, and 
who develops in succession, according to fixed laws, powers 
originally enveloped in the germs that he has received from 
nature, or that have been transmitted to him by heredity. 
646. Laws or InrettectuaL Evoturion. —In other terms, 
Mr. Spencer shows that the precepts of pedagogy cannot be 
. definitely deduced until the laws of mental evolution have 
been accurately established, and he attempts to determine 
some of these laws, 
‘He proves that the mind passes naturally from the simple 
to the complex, from the indefinite to the definite, from the 
concrete to the abstract, from the empirical to the rational ; 
that the genesis of the individual is the same as the genesis 
of the race; that the intelligence assimilates by preference 
that which it discovers for itself; finally, that all culture 
which profits the pupil is, at the same time, an exercise 
which stimulates him and delights him.
-P-A-G-E-579
THE SOIENCE OF HDUCATION. ‘649 
From this there result these practical consequences: that 
it is necessary first to present to the child simple subjects of 
study, individual things, sensible objects, for the purpose of 
starting him gradually on his way towards eomplex truths, 
abstract generalities, conceptions of the reason; that noth- 
ing can be exacted of the child’s intelligence but vague and 
incomplete notions which the travail of the mind will gradu- 
ally clarify and elaborate; that education ought to be in 
petto, for each individual, repetition and a copy of the gen- 
eral march of civilization and of the progress of humanity ; 
that it is necessary to count more on the personal effort of 
the pupil than upon the action of the teacher; that, finally, 
it is necessary to find the methods which interest, and even’ 
those which amuse. Hence the educator, instead of oppos- 
ing nature, instead of disconcerting her in her course and in 
the insensible steps of her real development, will restrict 
himself to following her step by step, and education will be 
no longer a force which obstructs, which represses, which 
smothers; but, on the contrary, a force which sustains and 
stimulates by associating with itself the work of the sponta- 
neous powers of the soul. 
647. Suur-Epvucation. — Mr. Spencer attaches great im- 
portance to that maxim which recommends us to encourage 
above all else self-education : — 
‘¢In education the process of self-development should be 
encouraged to the fullest extent. Children should be led to 
make their own investigations, and to draw their own infer- 
ences. They should be told as little as possible, and induced 
to discover as much as possible. Humanity has progressed 
solely by self-instruction ; and that to achieve the best re- 
sults; each mind must progress somewhat after the same 
fashion, is continually proved by the marked success of self-

made men. Those who have been brought up under the 
ordinary school-drill, and have carried away with them the 
idea that education is practicable only in-that. style, will 
think it hopeless to make children their own teachers. If, 
however, they will call to mind that the all-important knowl- 
edge of surrounding objects which a child gets in its early 
years is not without help,—if they will remember that the 
child is self-taught in the use of its mother tongue, —if they 
will estimate the amount of that experience of life, that out- 
of-school wisdom which every boy gathers for himself, —if 
they will mark the unusual. intelligence of the uncared-for 
London gamin, as shown in all the directions in which his 
faculties have been tasked, — if further, they will think how 
many minds have struggled up unaided, not only through the 
mysteries of our irrationally-planned curriculum, but through 
hosts of other obstacles besides; they will find it a not un- 
reasonable conclusion, that if the subjects be put before him 
in right order and right form, any pupil of ordinary capac- 
ity will surmount his successive difficulties with but little 
assistance.” 
648. Morat Epvcation. — Moral education, without fur- 
nishing occasion for as complete a theory as intellectual: 
education, has, nevertheless, suggested to Mr. Spencer some 
important reflections. 
Mr. Spencer expressly declares that he does not accept the 
dogma of Lord Palmerston, or what would be called in 
France the dogma of Rousseau, namely, that all children are 
born good. He would incline the rather toward the contrary 
opinion, which, ‘‘ though untenable,” he says, ‘* seems to us 
less wide of the truth”! Doubtless, we must not expect too 
much moral goodness of children; but it may be found that 
Mr. Spencer exaggerates a little, and draws too dark a por- |
-P-A-G-E-581
THE SCIENCE OF EDUCATION. 551 
trait of the child when he says, ‘‘ The child resembles the 
savage; his physical features, like his moral instincts, recall 
the savage.” Taken literally, such pessimism would lead 
logically to an over-severe moral discipline, wholly repressive 
and restraining. Such, however, is not the conclusion of 
Mr. Spencer, who recommends a course of tolerance and 
mildness, a system of relative letting alone which we might 
almost think dictated by the optimism of Rousseau. He 
censures the brutal discipline of the English schools. Finally, 
he would have the child treated, not as an incorrigible rebel 
who is obedient only to force, but as a reasonable being 
capable of readily comprehending the reasons and the advan- 
tages of obedience, from the simple fact that he takes into 
account the connection of cause and effect. 
649. System or Natura Pounisaments. — The true moral 
discipline, according to Mr. Spencer, is that which puts the 
child in a state of dependence on-nature, who teaches him to 
detest his faults by reason of the natural consequences which 
they involve. It is necessary to renounce artificial punish- 
ments, which are almost always irritating and taken amiss, 
and to have recourse, as a rule, only to the privations and the 
inconveniencies which are the necessary consequences, and, 
as it were, the inevitable reactions, of the acts which have 
been committed. 
A boy, for example, puts his room in disorder. In this 
case, the method of natural punishment requires that he him- 
self shall repair the mischief; and in this way he will soon 
correct himself of a turbulence from which he will be the first 
to suffer. 
A little girl, through indolence, or through tarrying too 
long over her toilet, has made herself late for a walk. Let 
her be punished by not waiting for het, by leaving her at
-P-A-G-E-582
552 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
home. This is the best means of curing her in the future of 
her indolence and coquetry. : 
The system which tends thus to substitute the lessons of 
nature for artificial penalties, certainly offers great advan- 
tages. It subjects the child, not to the authority of a pass- 
ing teacher, or of parents who will one day die, but to a law 
whose action neither ceases nor ever relents. Artificial pun- 
ishments often provoke the resistance of the child because he 
does not comprehend their meaning, and because, proceeding 
from the human will, they can be taxed with injustice and 
caprice. Could one as easily refuse to bow before the imper- 
sonal force of nature, —a force, which exactly adjusts the 
punishment to the fault, which accepts no excuse, against 
which there is no appeal, and which, without threats, with- 
out anger, rigorously and silently executes the law? 
650. Drrricunties In AppiicaTion. — Mr. Spencer’s-prin-~ 
ciple is excellent, but the opportunities for applying it are 
far less frequent than our philosopher believes. The child, 
in most cases, is too little reflective, too little reasonable, to 
comprehend, and especially to heed, the suggestions of per- 
sonal interest. 
Let us add that this principle -is wholly negative, that it 
furnishes at most only the means of shunning evil; that even 
‘in according to it an efficacy it does not have, it would stil 
be necessary to reproach it with narrowing moral culture by 
reducing it to the rather mean solicitude for simple utility ; 
finally, that it exercises no influence on the development of 
the positive virtues, on the disinterested education of moral- 
ity in what is noble and exalted. 
  
1 So far as experience can testify, this is a pure assumption. The most 
trifling injuries are often the most painful, and the most serious the most 
painless. (P.)
-P-A-G-E-583
THE SCIENCE OF EDUCATION, 558 
Finally, the system of natural punishments would incur the 
danger of often being cruel, and of causing the child an irrep- 
arable injury. Let pass the pin-cushion, the boiling water, 
and the candle-flame, —examples which Mr. Spencer pro- 
poses ; but what shall-we say of the bar of red-hot iron which 
he lets the child pick up? What shall be said, above all, of 
the grave consequences entailed by the faults of a young man 
left to himself? 
<¢ Would it not be,” says Gréard justly, “* to condemn the 
child to a régime so severe as to be an injustice, to count 
solely on the effects of natural reactions and inevitable con- 
sequences, for the purpose of disciplining his will?- The 
penalty which they provoke is the most often enormous as 
compared with the fault which has produced them, and man 
himself demands for his conduct other sanctions than those 
of a harsh reality. He desires that we judge the intention 
as well as the fact; that he be commended for his efforts: 
that in the first instance extreme measures be not taken 
against him; that the blow fall on him if needs be, but with- 
out crushing him, and while extending to him a hand to help 
him up.”?- 
651. Return zo Narors. — However it may be, Mr. 
Spencer is to be commended for having shown that for moral 
education as for intellectual education, the method which 
approaches nature the nearest is also the best. The return 
to nature which was the characteristic of Rousseau’s theories 
and of Pestalozzi’s practice, is also the dominant trait of Mr. 
Spencer’s pedagogy. 
If we look closely into the matter, this decided purpose to 
follow nature implicates something besides the superficial

554 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
condemnation of methods introduced by art. and human de< 
vice. It supposes a fundamental belief, —the belief in the 
beneficent purpose of natural instincts. ‘To have confidence 
in nature, to fall back on the spontaneous forces of the soul, 
because we discern behind them or in them a higher provi- 
dence or an internal foresight, is a belief generally useful and 
suggestive for conducting human affairs, but particularly 
necessary for directing the education of man. It is not 
without some surprise that we discover this belief at the basis 
of Mr. Spencer’s pedagogy, as though, by a contradiction 
which is not new, the evolutionist philosophy, which seems 
to exclude final causes from the conception of the universe, 
had been practically constrained to bow before them, and to 
proclaim, at least in the matter of education, the salutary 
efficacy of the theory which admits them. 
Thus, in speaking of physical education, Mr. Spencer 
remarks that the sensations are the natural guides, which it 
would be dangerous not to follow. 
‘Happily, that all-important part of education which goes 
to secure direct self-preservation, is in great part already 
provided for. Too momentous to be left to our own blunder- 
ing, Nature takes it into her own hands.” 
Speaking in another place of the instittcts which induce 
the child to move himself and to seek in physical exercise the 
basis of physical well-being, he declares that to oppose these 
instincts would be to go counter to the means ‘‘ divinely 
arranged ” for assuring the development of the body. 
652. Paysican Epucation. — The chapter devoted by Mr. 
Spencer to physical education, is such as might be expected 
from a thinker who is wholly exempt from idealistic preju- 
dices and who does not hesitate to write : — 
“The history of the world shows that the well-fed races 
have been the energetic and dominant races.”
-P-A-G-E-585
THE SCIENCE OF EDUCATION. 555 
- It is necessary first and above all to establish physical 
force in man, and to create within him “ a robust animal.” 
*« The actual education of children is defective in several 
particulars: in an insufficiency of food, in an insufficiency 
of clothing, in an insufficiency of exercise, and in an excess 
of mental application.” 
Mr. Spencer complains that modern education has become 
wholly intellectual, and that it neglects the body. He 
reminds us that ‘‘the preservation of health is one of our 
duties,” and that there exists a thing which might be called 
¢¢ physical morality.” 
Here, as everywhere, Mr. Spencer demands that we follow. 
the indications of nature. He explains on physiological 
grounds the apparently inordinate appetite which children 
show for certain foods, — sugar, for example. He urgently 
entreats that preference shall be given to play and to free 
and spontaneous exercise, over gymnastics, 
6538. GENERAL JUDGMENT. — That which, in our opinion, 
attests the truth of the pedagogical laws which we have just 
discussed, is that they are in agreement with the general 
opinions of the great modern reformers in education. It is 
thus that Spencer’s ideas are in close harmony with those 
which Pestalozzi had employed at Stanz. The success which 
he obtained there, as Mr. Spencer has remarked, depended 
on two things: first, on the attention which he used in: 
determining what kind of instruction the children had need 
of, and next, on the pains he took to associate the new knowl- 
edge with that which they already possessed. 
Mr. Spencer’s essay, then, deserves the attention of edu- 
cators. There is scarcely a book in which a keen scent: for 
details comes more agreeably to animate a fund of solid 
arguments, and from which it is more useful to extract the.

556 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
substance. However, it must not be read save with preca 
tion. The brilliant English thinker sometimes fails in just- 
ness and measure, and his bold generalizations need to be 
* tested with care. 
654, ALEXANDER Bain anp Epucation as A SciENcE.— 
Less brilliant than the work of Mr. Spencer, the book of 
Mr. Bain, Education as a Science, recommends itself by 
merits of studied analysis and scholarly minuteness. Others 
surpass Mr. Bain in brilliancy of imagination, in originality 
and in enthusiasm; but no one equals him in richness of 
details, in acuteness and abundance of observations. After 
the more venturesome have taken the lead and have pub- 
lished the original sketch, Mr. Bain appears and writes the 
methodical and complete manual. His own work resembles 
that of a conscientious guard who marches in the rear of 
@ victorious army, and by a wise organization makes sure 
~ the positions conquered by the march of an impetuous 
commander-in-chief. His book, in other terms, is but the 
studious and thorough development of Mr. Spencer’s prin- 
ciples. 
655. Generar Impression. —It is impossible in an analy- 
sis to bring out the merit of a book which is especially 
valuable for the multiplicity of the questions which the 
author discusses in it, and for the infinite variety of the 
solutions which he proposes. There are landscapes which 
discourage the painter, because, notwithstanding their 
beauty, they are too vast, too full of details, to admit of 
being crowded into a frame. We may say the same of Mr. 
Bain’s book. One must have studied it himself in order to 
form an estimate of its value. Professors of all classes will 
here find pages of. well-considered counsels, and judicious 
reflections upon educational methods. The nature of studs.
-P-A-G-E-587
THE SCIENCE OF EDUCATION. 557 
tes, the sequence of subjects, the gradation of difficulties, 
the choice of exercises, the comparison. of oral instruction 
with text-book instruction, modes of discipline; — nothing 
escapes a thinker who is not a mere theorist or an amateur 
educator, but a professional man, a competent teacher, an 
experienced professor. 
Indeed, no one should allow himself to be deceived by this 
fine phrase, Education as a Science, which might disconcert 
and turn aside whole classes of readers, such as those who, 
in works cn education, especially desire a guide for practice. 
On the contrary, they will have every reason to commend a 
book which passes yery quickly from generalities to applica- 
tions, and which is above all else a manual of practical and 
technical pedagogy. The study of it will be profitable not 
merely to professors who are teaching the higher branches of 
literature and science, but even to the humblest instructors, 
and even—for Mr. Bain overlooks no detail—to teachers 
of reading and writing. . 
656. Division or THE Work. — Education as a Science 
comprises three parts: 1. psychological data; 2. methods 
3. modern education. 
The author first inquires in what order the faculties are 
developed, and what effect this order should have on the 
distribution of studies. This is the psychological part. 
Then follows a discussion of what Mr. Bain calls the logical 
order, that is, of the relations which exist between the 
studies themselves and their different parts. This is the 
“ analytical problem” of education.’ 
These preliminaries being establistad, Mr. Bain enters 
  1 By the “analytical problem ” of education, Mr. Eain means the deters 
mining of the education value of subjects. See Education as a Scienog 
Chapter ¥.. (P.)
-P-A-G-E-588
558 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
upon the principal theme, — the methods of ‘instruction. He 
discusses one after another the first elements of reading, 
object-lessons, ‘‘ which, more than any other means of 
instruction, require to be practised with care, for without 
this, an. admirable process might, in unskillful hands, be 
nothing more than a thing of seductive appearance, but with- 
out value”; then methods relating to history, geography, the 
sciences, and the languages. : 
Finally, in his third book, Mr. Bain exhibits a new plan of 
study, with particular reference to secondary instruction. 
657. PsycHotocican Orper anp Loeican Orper. — In 
his reflections on the development of the mind and upon the 
distribution of studies, Mr. Bain is inspired by the prin- 
ciples which have guided Mr. Spencer. 
. “Observation precedes reflection. The concrete comes 
before the abstract.” 
In education, then, the sequence should be from the sim. 
ple to the complex, from the particular to the general, from 
the indefinite to the definite, from the empirical to the rational, 
from analysis to synthesis, from the outline to details ; finally, 
from the material to the immaterial. 
Such would be the ideal order in education; but Mr. Bain 
remarks that in practice all sorts of obstacles come to disturb 
this rigorous sequence. 
658. Moprrn Epucation. — The plan of secondary studies 
which Mr. Bain recommends to the reformers of teaching is 
the result and the résumé of all these observations. 
Intellectual education, common to all young people who 
receive a liberal instruction, would henceforth comprise three 
essential parts: 1. the sciences; 2. the humanities; 3. rhet- 
oric and the national literature. We see at once what is te
-P-A-G-E-589
THE SCIENCE OF EDUCATION. 559 
be understood by this last item; but the two others have 
need of some explanations. 
"The sciences are divided into two groups : those which are 
to be mastered, —arithmetic, geometry, algebra, physics, 
chemistry, biology, psychology; and the natural sciences, 
which should be studied only superficially because they would 
overwhelm the memory under the weight of too large a num- 
per of facts. Geography, which, one does not know why, is 
included in the sciences, while history is attached to the hu- 
manities, will complete the programme of scientific studies. 
As to the humanities, Mr. Bain preserves scarcely more 
than the name while suppressing ‘the thing; for in the cur- 
tailed and disfigured domain which he persists in calling by 
this name, he cuts off precisely that which has always been 
considered as constituting its essence, — the study of the 
dead languages. He excludes from it even the living lgn- 
guages, and that which he still decorates with the fine title 
of humanities, is still science, — moral science, it is true, — 
“ history and sociology with political economy and jurispru- 
dence.” 
A course in universal literature, but, be it understood, 
without original texts, might afterwards be added to this pre- 
tended teaching of the humanities. 
Two or three hours a week would be devoted parallelly, 
during the whole course of study, which would last six years, 
to each of the three departments of instruction which Mr. 
Bain thinks equally important. 
As to the real humanities, dead or living languages, they 
should no longer be included in education save as optional 
and extra studies, on the same basis as the accomplishments. 
And, appealing to the future, Mr. Bain even predicts that 
‘‘a day will come when it will be found that this is still 
granting them too large a place in education.”
-P-A-G-E-590
560 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
Mr. Bain, then, gives all his preferences to scientific 
studies, and his book might properly be entitled, not only 
Education as a Science, but also Science in Education. 
659. TuroreticaL Errors. ~— Mr. Bain reproaches letters 
with giving the mind the habit of servility. By what sin- 
gular revulsion of thought can the liberal studies par excel- 
lence be represented as a school of intellectual servitude? It 
is rather to scientific instruction that we may properly return 
the accusation of enslaving the spirit. By their inexorable 
evidence and by their very exactness, do not the sciences 
sometimes smother the originality and the free flight of the 
imagination? 
This defect, however, does not cut them off from a right 
to a place, and to a large place, in the programme of intel- 
Jectual education. Let us accept with favor their alliance, 
‘let us admit them to a certain degree of fellowship, but do 
not let us tolerate their encroachments. In @ word, the ob- 
ject of the sciences is either pure abstractions or material 
realities. He who studies mathematics and physics first ac- 
quires real knowledge of high value; and, on ‘the other hand, 
fie strengthens his mind through the habits engendered by 
the rigorous methods which the sciences employ. We cheer- 
fully grant to Mr. Bain that the sciences are at the same time 
admirable sources of useful truths and valuable instruments 
of mental discipline. By cultivating them we gain not only 
the positive knowledge which they teach respecting the world, 
but-also the power, rigor, and exactness which they impose 
on their adepts. 
660. InsUFFICIENCY OF THE Scrences. — But the question is 
to know whether the sciences, so useful and so necessary for 
enriching and disciplining the mind, are also the best agents 
for training it. The educator is not in the situation of tba

farmer who has only two things to do,— to plow and sow 
the field which he cultivates. The work of education is vast 
in another direction. It has to do with developing the apti- 
tudes or latent energies, that which the philosophy of the day 
hardly allows us longer to call faculties, but that which they 
re-establish under another name, that of the unconscious 
forces of the soul: it has to do, not with laboring on a soil 
almost entirely prepared by nature, but in great part. with 
creating the soil itself. Now, the sciences are indeed the 
seed which it will be proper by and by to sow on the field, but 
they are not the substance which nourishes and fertilizes ft. 
661. Srwnsvaistic TenpEncies. —If we go to the bottom 
of Mr. Bain’s thought and doctrine on the mind, we shall 
find the secret of his ardent preference for the teaching of 
the sciences. His errors in practical pedagogy proceed from 
theoretical errors on human nature. 
For him, as for Locke, there are not, properly speaking, 
‘ntellectual forces independent of the facts which succeed: 
one another in the consciousness. Consequently, there is 
not an education of the. faculties. Memory or imagination, 
considered as a distinct power, a3 an aptitude more or less 
happy, is but a word. It is nothing apart from the recollee 
tions or the images which are successively graven in the mind. 
For Mr. Bain, as for Locke, the best education is that which 
places items of knowledge side by side in the mind, which 
accumulates facts there, but not that which seeks to enkindle 
in the soul a flame of intelligence. : 
That which also warps the theoretical views of Mr. Bain 
is that he accords no independence, no individual life, to the 
mind; and that for him, back of the facts of consciousness, 
there come to view, without any intermedium, the cerebral 
organs. Now the brain is developed of itself; it acquires
-P-A-G-E-592
562 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
fatally, with the progress of years, more weight and mora 
volume ; it passes from the age of concrete things to the age 
of abstractions. Hence a reduction, an inevitable contrac- 
tion, of the sphere of education. There is nothing more to 
do than to let nature have her way, and to fill the vase which 
she charges herself with constructing. : 
662. Urmirartan Tenpencres. — Finally, to conclude this 
indication of the general ideas which dominate and whic’ 
mar the pedagogy of Mr. Bain, let us observe that a positive 
and practical utility, a vulgar utility, mingles too many of 
its inspirations with it. The criterion of utility is some- 
times applied to it with an artless extravagance. Thus, in 
the languages, only those words should be learned whick 
occur the most often, and in the sciences, only the parts 
which are of the most frequent use. Even in moral educa- 
tion, as it is conceived by the English philosopher, are to be 
found, as we might expect, these utilitarian and narrow 
views. 
Would one believe, for example, that Mr. Bain makes 
the fear of the penal code the mainspring of the teaching 
of virtue?! Here, at least, we must acknowledge that sci- 
ence is insufficient. ‘‘To pretend, for example, that physi- 
ology can teach us moderation in the sexual appetite is to 
attribute to it a result which no science has yet been able to 
give.” But must we count any more, as Mr. Bain would 
  
1 We might dwell on Mr. Bain’s observations relative to punishments. 
Here is what Gréard says of them: ‘“ Mr. Bain, with infinite good sense 
and disciplinary tact, is much less concerned with applying the rule than 
with the conditions according to which it should be applied. On this point 
he enters into details full of scruples. He does not hesitate to call to his 
aid the knowledge of the masters of penal jurisprudence, aud his recom- 
mendations, added to those of Bentham, comprise not less than thirty 
articles.”
-P-A-G-E-593
THE SCIENCE OF EDUCATION. 563 
have us, for example, on social influences and on personal 
experience? In this truly experimental education in virtue, 
ethics would be learned just as the mother tongue is learned, 
by use, by the imitation of others; and moral instruction, 
properly so called, would be a sort of grammar which is to 
rectify vicious practices. 
663. Fina, Jupement.—But our criticisms on the gen- 
eral tendencies of Mr. Bain’s pedagogy subtract nothing from 
our admiration of the sterling qualities of his Hducation as a 
Science. Doubtless there. would also be errors of detail te 
notice, or some particular methods to discuss; for example, 
that of never doing more than one thing at a time, or the pro- 
priety of first teaching to children the history of their country. 
Mr. Bain forgets that mythological history and sacred his- 
tory, by their legendary and fabulous character, offer a par- 
ticular attraction to the childish imagination, and are better 
adapted than history proper to infant minds. But, aside 
from the portions which are debatable, how many wise obser- 
vations to gather on the different processes of instruction, 
on the transition from the concrete to the abstract, on the 
discretion which must be employed in object-lessons, the use 
of which so easily degenerates into abuse! Even through 
its absolute theories, Education as a Science will render 
great services ; for, to illustrate the march of thought, noth- 
ing is so valuable as opinions which are exclusive and sin- 
cere. It were even desirable, if one did not fear to experi- 
ment on human souls, in anima subdlimi, that according to 
Mr. Bain’s plan, the experiment should be tried of an educa: 
tion exclusively scientific. 
664. American Epucators. CHANNING (1780-1842).— 
The general fault of English pedagogy is its aristocratic. 
ehdracter. For Mr. Spencer and Mr. Bain, as for Locke,'it:

is simply a question of the education of a gentleman.’ It is 
in America, in the writings of Channing arid Horace Mann, 
that we must seek the elements of a theory'of democratic 
education, and of popular instruction." 
Channing, a Unitarian minister, associated religious senti- 
ment and philosophic reason, and desired that in theology 
itself everything should issue in the supremacy of the human 
judgment. The most interesting of his writings are the pub- 
lic lectures which he gave in Boston in 1838, and the object 
of which is the education one gives himself, and the eleva- 
tion of the working classes. We lack the space to give an 
analysis of these lectures, but a few quotations will make 
known the general spirit of the American reformer : — 
*¢T am not discouraged by the objection that the laborer, 
if encouraged to give time and strength to the elevation of 
his mind, will starve himself and impoverish the country, 
when I consider the energy, and the efficiency of Mind. 
‘The highest force in the universe is Mind. Thig created 
the heavens and earth. This has changed the wilderness into 
fruitfulness, and linked distant countries in a beneficent min- 
istry to one another’s wants. It is not to brute force, to 
physical strength, so much as to art, to skill, to intellectual 
and moral energy, that men owe their mastery over the world. 
It is mind which has conquered matter. To fear, then, that 
by calling forth a people’s mind, we shall impoverish and 
starve them, is to be frightened at a shadow.” 
“Tt is chiefly through books that we enjoy intercourse with 
superior minds, and these invaluable means of communication 
are in the reach of all. In the best books, great men talk to 
us, give us their most precious thoughts, and pour their souls 
  
  1 There should be added to these the works of Swiss, Italian, and French 
educators, particularly of Siciliani, and the original and eminently sugges-_ 
tive studies of Bernard Perez. .

into ours. God be thanked for books. They are the voices 
of the distant and the dead, and make us heirs of the spiritual 
life of past ages. Books are the true levellers. They give 
to all, who will faithfully use them, the society, the spiritual 
presence, of the best and greatest of our race. No matter 
how poor I am; no matter though the prosperous of my own 
time will not enter my obscure dwelling ; if the sacred writers 
will enter and take up their abode under my roof, if Milton 
will cross my threshold to sing to me of Paradise, and Shake- 
speare to open to me the worlds of imagination and the 
workings of the human heart, and Franklin to enrich me with 
his practical wisdom, I shall not pine for want of intellectual 
companionship, and I may become a cultivated man though 
excluded from what is called the best society in the place 
where I live.” 
665. Herace Mann (1796-1859). Horace Mann is not 
a philosopher who discusses education, buta statesman who 
reformed and developed the education of his country. Secre- 
tary of the Massachusetts Board of Education, he opened 
schools, founded libraries, and pronounced a great number of 
discourses, the best known of which is The Necessity of 
Education in a Republican Government. 
«* When, then,” he often said, ‘ will men give their thought 
to. infancy? We watch the seed which we confide to the 
earth, but we do not concern ourselves with the human soul 
till the sun of youth has set. Were it in my power, I would 
scatter books over all the earth as men sow wheat on the 
plowed fields.” 
Speaking to Americans, to working people, and to trades: 
men, he made apparent the positive advantages of instruc: 
tion : — 
*sIf to-morrow some one were to tell you that a coal ane

had been discovered which would pay ten per cent, you would 
all rush to it; and yet there are men whom you let grovel in 
ignorance when you might realize from forty to fifty per cent 
on them. You are ever giving your thought to capital and 
to machines ; but the first machine is man, and the first capi- 
tal, man; and you neglect him.” 
But he also interested himself in the moral effects of edu. 
cation, especially in a democratic society, where each citizen 
is a sovereign :— 
«The education which has already been given a people 
makes it necessary to'give them more. By instructing them, 
new powers have been awakened in them, and this intellectual 
and moral energy must be regulated. In this case we have 
not to do with mechanical forces, which, once put in action, 
accomplish their purpose and then stop. No; these are spir- 
itual forces endowed with a principle of life and of progress 
which nothing can quench.” 
666. ConcLuston. —The labors of Mr. Spencer and Mr. 
Bain, the works of Channing and Mann, and others still, 
will contribute, we hope, to prepare the definite solutions 
demanded by our times in the matter of education. These 
solutions are important for the security and the greatness of 
our country. More than ever it is necessary that education 
become something else than an affair of inspiration, aban- 
doned to caprice and hazard, but that it be a work of reflec- 
tion. It is said that the future is uncertain, that events are 
leading French society no one knows where, and that our 
destinies are at the mercy of the most unforeseen storms. 
We do not believe this, since it is within our power that it 
shall be otherwise. “There is a means, in fact, of assuring 
the future of peoples, and this is to give them an intellectual 
and moral education which purifies.the soul and strengthens
-P-A-G-E-597

eharacter. Do not let us look:for regeneration and progress 
from a sudden and miraculous transformation ; do not let us 
demand them even of the immediate efficiency of such or 
such a political institution. Everything here below is accom- 
plished according to the laws of a slow ‘progression, by 
trifling and successive modifications. Just as for the child 
there is no abridgment which allows us to suppress the 
slow steps of the insensible growth which each year brings 
forward, so for nations there is no other process than the 
action, slow but sure, of a wise and vigorous education, for 
causing them to pass from vice to virtue, from abasement te to 
grandeur. 
‘The partisans of evolution sometimes seem to announce 
to us the near apparition of a race superior to our own, 
called to supplant us, as we shall have supplanted the infe- 
rior races. One day or another we shall be liable, it seems, 
to meet ‘‘at the angle of a rock” the successor of the 
human race. We count but little on such promises, and the 
coming of this hypothetical race of men, suddenly evoked 
by a wave of the magic wand of natural selection, leaves us 
very incredulous. 
Happily, we know another means, a much surer process, 
for causing to appear, not a strange race, until now un+ 
known, but generations of more worth than our own, which 
are superior to it in physical force, as in qualities of mind 
or virtues of character. This means is to establish, through 
reflection and reason, an education better adapted to our 
destination; an education broader and more complete, at 
once more severe and more liberal, since it will at the same 
time exact more toil and permit more scope; in which the: 
ehild will learn to count more on himself; in which his indo- 
jence will no longer be encouraged by accustoming ‘him 
jnopportunely to invoke supernatural aid; in which instrao
-P-A-G-E-598

tion will no longer be a formulary recited is lip-service, but 
an inner and profound acquisition of the ‘soul, in which the 
fear of the conscience will be substituted for the other rules 
of conduct, and in which thought and free reflection will no 
longer be distrusted; finally, an education more scientific 
and more rational, because it will neglect nothing which can 
develop a human soul and bring it into likeness with its 
ideal: Now that education to which the future belongs, 
notwithstanding the obstacles which the spirit of the past 
will still stir up against it, — that education is not possible, 
its laws cannot be established, its methods cannot be prac- 
tised, except on one condition; this is, that the psychology. 
of the child be written, and well written, and that reflection 
draw from this psychology all the consequences which it 
permits. 
[667. Commenr on Mr. Spencer’s Epvcation. — Mon- 
sieur Compayré might have emphasized his cautions. Read 
with caution, and with a purpose to weigh the truth, Mr. 
Spencer’s Education is inspiring and wholesome ; but it may 
be doubted whether there has been written, since the Emile, 
a book on education which is so well fitted to deceive 
an unwary reader by its rhetoric and philosophic plausi- 
bility. The air of breadth and candor with which the writer 
sets out is eminently prepossessing, and the reader is almost 
obliged to assume that he is being led to foregone conziu- 
sions. The first chapter, in particular, is a piece of literary 
art, in which there is such a deft handling of sentiment and 
pathos as to unfit the susceptible reader for exercising his 
own critical judgment. 
In this place I can only indicate in the briefest manner 
what seem to be the fundamental errors contained in the 
book :—-
-P-A-G-E-599
THE SCIENCE ‘OF EDUCATION. 509° 
1. Mr. Spencer does not distinguish between the immedi- 
ate and the mediate practical value of knowledges. We may 
admit with him that science is of inestimable value to the 
human race ;- but it does not follaw by any means that every 
person must be versed in science. As we need not own 
everything that is essential to our comfort, so we need not 
have as a personal possession all the knowledge that we 
need for guidance. 
2. It is a very low conception of education that would 
limit its function to adapting a man merély to that state in- 
life ‘into which he chances to be born. _The Bushman, the 
Red Indian, and the accountant, sre unfortunate illustra- 
tions of the province of education. Often the highest func-. 
tion of education is to lift a man out of his ancestral state. 
3. That the value of a subject for guidance is the same 
as its value for discipline, is true under only one assump- 
tion, — that the Bushman is always to remain a Bushman, 
and the Red Indian always a Red Indian, as by the new 
philosophy of course they should. Practical teachers very 
well know that, as a rule, the studies that are the most 
yaluable for practical use are the least valuable for disci- 
pline. Mr. Spencer quotes no better proof of his assump- 
tion than “the beautiful economy of Nature.” 
4. Mr. Spencer’s proposed education is sordid in its utili- 
tarianism. He is preoccupied with man as an instrument 
rather than with a human being aspiring towards the highest 
type of his kind. A liberal education should be preoccu- 
pied first with the training of the man, then with the train- 
ing of the instrument. 
5. Mr. Spencer’s restatement of Condillac’s and Comte’s 
joctrine, that individual education should be a repetition of 
dvilization in petio, is at best but a specious generalization. 
Che doctrine cannot be applied to practice, in any considera
-P-A-G-E-600
570 THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 
ble degree, if we would, and should not be, if we could, for 
it ignores one essential factor in progress, — inheritance. 
6. The part assigned to ‘‘ Nature” in the work of educa: 
tion is so overstrained as to be unnatural and absurd. 
Physical science has long since discarded this myth of 
Nature personified. It is only in educational science that 
this fiction is still employed to eke out an argument. 
7. The doctrine of consequences which underlies Mr. 
Spencer’s system of moral education is applicable to but a 
limited number of ‘cases, or, if applied with thoroughness, 
is inhuman. Not even all the fit would survive if they were 
not shielded from the consequences of their acts by human 
sympathy and oversight. ]
-P-A-G-E-601
APPENDIX. 
  A. 
Sueaestions To TEacHERS OF THe History or Pepacocy. 
Tue two aims to be kept in view in the teaching of this 
subject are culture and guidance. The purpose should be to 
extend the intellectual horizon of the teacher, or, to use 
Plato’s phrase, to make him ‘* the spectator of all time and 
all existence”; and, in the second place, to furnish the 
teacher with a clew which will safely conduct him through 
the mazes of systems, methods, and doctrines. There is no 
other profession that has derived so little profit from capital- 
jzed experiences; and there is no profession in which cul- 
ture and breadth are more necessary. 
For securing the ends here proposed, it is recommended: 
that a plan somewhat like the following be pursued in the 
use of this volume : — 
i. If there are three recitations a week, assign one 
‘chapter for each of the first two recitations, to be carefully 
and thoughtfully read, and require each pupil to select one 
special topic to present and discuss when he is called upon 
in the recitation ; and for the third recitation in each week, 
require each pupil to select a topie from any part of the 
book which has thus far been studied. The purpose of this 
plan is to bring before the class, in sharp outline, the salient 
points of the subject; and, at the same time, to create a 
sense of the organic unity of the theme as a comprehensive
-P-A-G-E-602
572 : APPENDIX. 
whole. When there are more than three recitations a week, 
ouly a part of a chapter need be assigned for an advancz 
lesson. 
2. When the first survey of the subject has been made 
in ‘the way just suggested, a review may be conducted as 
tollows :— 
(1.) Biographical. Following a chronological order, di- 
vide the whole treatise into as many sections as there are 
recitations to be devoted to this purpose, and require each 
pupil to make a careful study of some educator, as Socrates, 
Montaigne, or Pestalozzi, and to present this theme when 
called upon in recitation. When there is opportunity, en- 
courage pupils to amplify their themes with information de- 
rived from other sources. 
. (2.) Topical. Require each pupil to select some doctrine, 
system, or method, and to show, in a systematic way, its 
origin, progress, and termination. In this review, encourage 
the critical spirit, and make the recitation to consist, in part, 
of a free discussion of principles and doctrines. The value 
of this subject for guidance will appear in this part of the 
etudy. 
(3.) By Chapters. Require each pupil to prepare a sum- 
mary of some chapter in the book, emphasizing the more 
important truths that are taught in it, and showing the ten- 
dency or drift of educational thought. The culture value of 
the subject will appear in this part of the study. By this 
mode of treatment, the subject can be compassed, with good 
results, in twenty weeks. 
3. Where no more than twelve or fourteen weeks can be 
given to this subject, it is recommended that the following 
chapters be selected: I., II., III, IV., V., VI., VIL, X., 
XMU., XUI., XVII., XTX., XX., XXI., XXII. 
For use in Teachers’ Meetings held by superintendents, the
-P-A-G-E-603

following chapters are suggested: II., III., V., VI., VIL., 
X., XUL, XVII, XX., XXII. 
For use in Teachers’ Reading Circles, either of the above 
selections will serve a good purpose.

Compayré’s Lectures on Pedagogy. 
Translated and edited by W. H. Payne, Professor of the Science and Art of 
Teaching, University of Michigan, and President of the Peabody Normal Col- 
lege. Cloth. 500 pages. Retail price, $1.75. Special price for class use. 
HIS is a companion volume to the author’s History oF PEDA- 
GoGy and is characterized by the qualities that are so conspic- 
uous in the earlier volume; it is comprehensive, clea:, accurate, and 
is written with rare critical insight. To have an original and superior 
mind elaborate a systematic theory of education out of the best his. 
toric material accessible, and present as its complement a revised 
series of methods, would be thought an invaluable service to the 
teaching profession, but this is precisely what M. Compayré has 
done in this charming volume. It is the most original and satisfac- 
tory manual for teachers that has ever appeared in English.

Psychology Applied to Education. 
By Gapriet ComPayre. Translated by Wm. H. Payne, Chancellor of the 
University of Nashville. Cloth. 225 pages. Retail price, 90 cents. 
N the statement of doctrine and application, this manual is profound 
without being obscure, and simple without being commonplace. 
There are thousands of teachers who have neither the taste nor the 
‘leisure to master the details of educational science, nor even to read the 
profounder treatises, but who are anxious to find a rational basis for 
their art ; for such there is no book that can be commended so highly.

T, he Essentials of Method. 
,.. Revised Edition. A discussion of the essential forms of right method in teach- ‘ing by CHARLES DE Garmo, Professor of Education, Cornell University. 
Cloth. 133 pages. Retail price, 65 cents. Special price for class use. 
‘THIS little volume is an initial work in the science of methods, It 
assumes, therefore, an importance and significance which are 
hot measured by its size or price. 
It comprises three parts: 1. The psychological basis. This con- 
sists, mostly of a discussion of the nature of the individual and .the 
:general notion, and of the true nature of mental assimilation,-or ap- 
_prehension ; 2. The necessary stages of rational methods as deter- 
mined by the psychological basis; we have here an exposition of the 
funetions of observation, of generalization and of the application of 
generalizations in fixing and utilizing knowledge ; 3. Practical illustra. 
tions, showing how the teacher may consciously observe these stages in 
his daily work. The Revised Edition gives both a popular and a 
_seientific explanation of the modern doctrine of Apperception. 
Habit in Education. 
‘An Essay ‘in Pedagogical Psychology. Translated from the German. of Dr. 
‘PauL RapEsTock by F. A. Caspart Girls’ High School, Baltimore; with an 
Introduction-by Dr..G. Srantey Hatt, President of Clark University. Cloth. 
124 pages. Retail price, 75 cents. 
TR. Radestock discusses the various habits in the acquisition of 
] which educators can aid their pupils. Not content with giving 
-the.result of his own experience and study he offers extracts from the 
‘works of such widely different authorities as Herbart, Tito Vignoli, 
‘Ribot, Dumont, Spencer and -Maudsley, and clearly states the two 
conflicting pedagogical problems which confront the teacher, yet to 
one or the other of which he must look as the aim of all his efforts: 
—- Which brings the better result? To follow Rousseau, who says: 
“ The only habit which a child should be permitted to acquire is, that 
it habituate itself to nothing in particular,” or Bacon, who says: 
“ Since custom is the principal magistrate of man’ slife, let men, by 
all means, endeavor to obtain good customs. Certainly, custom is 
most perfect when it ‘beginneth in young years; this we call educa- 
tion, which is inseffect but early custom.”

    A Laboratory Course in Physiological Psy- 
_ chology. By EpMunp-C. SANFORD, Assistant Professor of Psychology, Clark 
University, Worcester, Mass. Part I—ch.i-vi. 187 pages. Cloth. Introduc- 
tion price, 90 cents. Part 1—ch. vii-ix, 201 pages. go cents. 
HE use of the laboratory. in teaching psychology is indorsed. by - 
the experience of the other sciences, by the approval of the best 
teachers, and by the psychological Iaboratories recently opened in 
leading colleges and universities in this country and in Europe. The 
need of some definite schedule of experiments for such work,in the 
practice course in the laboratory of Clark University gave occasion for 
the first collection of the experiments here published in a form which 
it is hoped will make them useful to others: The aim has been to 
introduce the student to the most important facts and chief. methods 
of experimental psychology so.far as they are adapted to the handling 
of college men and within a moderate expense for apparatus. The 
course. includes experiments upon the Dermal Senses, Static and 
Kinesthetic Senses, Taste, Smell, Hearing, Vision, Psycho-physic. 
The Connection of Thought and Memory. 
A contribution to pedagogical psychology. By HERMAN T. Lukens, Honorary 
Fellow in Psychology in Clark University. Based on F. W. Dorpfeld’s Mono- 
graph, “ Denken und Gedachtnis.” Published under the auspices of the Herbart- 
Club, with an Introduction by Dr. G. Stanley Hall, President of Clark Univer- 
sity. Cloth, 179 pages. Retail price, $1.00 
TT" is a Herbartian book, showing how the interdependence of 
thought and memory should be realized in practice, followed by 
illustrations taken from History, Natural Science, Literature, and 
Arithmetic. It is an application of the theory of Apperception, and is 
intended for teachers’ reading-circles, normal schools, and private 
‘ séading. Being based on the work of Dorpfeld, which grew out of 
round-table conferences with teachers, it may be said to have already 
proved its helpfulness for teachers in Germany; and the adaptation to 
American ideas and conditions, while modifying the original in many. 
respects, keeps true to its ideal. 
Although in the main following Herbartian principles, the book does 
not ignore the suggestions of psychological work that has been done 
in the last fifty years, but it is in touch with the latest approved ideas 
of the present day.

  Organic Education. 
A manual for teachers in primary and: grammar grades. By HARRIET M. 
Scort, Principal of the Normal Training School, Detroit, Mich. Cloth, 352 
pages. Retail price, $1.25. 
HE plan of this work in general consists of the use of typical 
periods of civilization as material for the work of the various 
grades. These périods have been chosen as satisfying the natural 
instincts and interests of children at certain stages in their develop- 
ment. ‘They seem to be consecutive in the lives of most children as 
well as in the history of civilization. These periods are:—i, the 
Nomadic ‘Period, represented by the North American Indian; fi, the 
Pastoral and Agricultural Periods, represented by the earlier Aryan; 
iii, the Persian Period ; iv, the Greek Period; v, the Roman Period; 
vi, the Germanic Period; vii, the Period of Feudalism and Chivalry ; 
viii, the Renaissance Period; ix, the Puritan Period. The study of 
the Puritans in America is followed by a study of American National 
develépment, in lines of political, industrial and social progress, and 
then bya similar, though less detailed, survey of the civilization of 
the other grand continental divisions of the world, and later of the 
world as a: whole. 
The book is divided into two parts. Part I embodies the philo- 
sophical interpretation of the plan. It presents a clear outline of the 
purpose and aim of the work. Part II contains a detailed statement 
of the methods and the materials that will be found most helpful. 
Conscious Motherhood. 
Or, the earliest unfolding of the child in the cradle, nursery, and kindergarten. 
By EMMA MARWEDEL. Cloth. 560 pages. Retail price, 
HIS book was out of print for some years, but the demand for it 
“~ continued so steadily that a new edition has been prepared. 
Miss Marwedel’s “ Conscious Motherhood ” is in itself a’ key to the 
whole of Froebel’s philosophy, whose depths ‘she has sounded more 
thoroughly than any of his disciples in this country. 
The work is the most profound and most practical on the kinder- 
garten and mothers’ earliest work with children that has ever been

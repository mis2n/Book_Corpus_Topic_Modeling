THE POWER OF COMMON SCHOOLS TO REDEEM THE STATE FROM. 
SOCIAL VICES AND CRIMES.! 
By Horace Mann, 
Secretary Massachusetts State Board of Education. 
The incontestable progress which the cause of popular education is making ins 
Massachusetts and in some of the other States of our Union is a subject for hearty 
congratulation among ourselves and for devout gratitude to Heaven. It can not be- 
denied that the cause has won to itself most able and earnest advocates, who are ins 
no way officially connected with it, but who cherish it from the purest motives of. 
‘duty and philanthropy. But it happens to this, as to all other good causes, that,. 
some of its professed friends have attached themselves to it from collateral and some- 
from sinister motives. It is equally true that the cause has enemies, although in: 
this community there are but few who dare to make open proclamation of their~ 
hostility. But opponents are all the more formidable when their opposition is secret. 
Their measures of counteraction are not the less efficient because they are indirect: 
and hide their origin under specious pretenses. There is a third class who have no~ 
faith in the utility of education. They number it among what they are pleased to- 
call the Utopian schemes of reform with which the age is teeming, and they regard» 
with an ill-concealed suspicion either the honesty of purpose or the soundness of 
intellect of those who are laboring to uphold its banner and to bear it forward... 
There are those also who suspect in education the existence of some unknown and. 
mystical power which, should it once obtain the ascendency, would bear the~ 
“community onward, they know not whither; and having some ism or ology of their~ 
own by which, provided all civil institutions and Nature herself will succumb to- 
their dictation, they can forthwith extricate the world from all its troubles and carry 
it forward in the directest line and with the swiftest speed to a millennial goal, they: 
discard an agency whose power they can neither control nor comprehend. And 
lastly, there are those who array themselves against education solely from mercenary-

motives—because of the one or two mills upon the dollar which its support subtracts’ 
from their property. 
To meet the opposition and the indifference originating in these and similar prejudg- 
ments, the subject of education has been very much “agitated,” particularly in the 
northern portion of our country, within the last dozen years, There can be no haz- 
ard in affirming that far more has been spoken and printed, heard and read, on this 
theme within the last twelve years than eyer before, were it all put together, since 
the settlement of the colonies. The consequence certainly has been a very marked 
development of the merits of the subject and a corresponding opening or expansion 
of the public mind for their recognition. To many sensible men it has come like a 
revelation, inspiring hopes for the amelioration of mankind and for the perpetuity 
of our institutions which they had never dréamed of before. There are thousands 
of persons among us whose once darkened minds have been so quickened with life 
and illuminated with wisdom on this subject as to beget an intolerable impatience 
under old imperfections, a perception of which has made rest impossible and the 
pleasures of home uncomfortable until, within their respective spheres, they had 
effected a reform. 
In order to make this subject more intelligible to the common mind, as well as to 
conform to broad distinctions which Nature herself has established, it has been 
considered under a threefold aspect—first, as embracing the proper care and train- 
ing of the body, that its health and longevity may be secured; second, as cultivating 
the faculties by which we perceive, compare, analyze and combine, remember, 
reason, and perceive natural fitness and the beauty of things, so that we may know 
more of the world in which we are placed and of the glorious attributes of its Maker, 
and so that, by more faithfully harmonizing our conduct with its laws, we may the 
better enjoy its exquisite adaptations to our welfare; and third, as fashioning our 
moral nature into some resemblance to its divine original, subordinating our pro- 
pensities to the law of duty, expanding our benevolence into a sentiment of universal 
brotherhood, and lifting our hearts to the grateful and devout contemplation of God. 
In pursuance of these fundamental ideas, it has been shown by the authority of 
the highest medical men in the country that even in the present imperfect state of 
physiological science more than one-half of all the cases of bodily disability and 
disease, more than one-half of all the pains and expenditures of sickness, more than’ 
one-half of all the cases of premature death—that is, of death under the age of 70 
years—are the consequence of sheer ignorance—not of any irrepealable decree or 
fatality necessitating their existence, independently of our consent and cooperation, 
but of our own brutish ignorance of the conditions of health and life to which our 
bodies have been subjected by their Maker. And I desire, also, to be here 
understood as not including in this moiety of unnecessary suffering and of untimely 
death a single one of that extensive class of cases which result from a slavish 
submission to some tyrannous appetite, such as intemperance for instance, where 
the knowledge, even if we possessed it, might be overborne in a conflict with the 
sensual desire; but I mean maladies, pains, and death which a bad man would be as 
quick to avoid asa good one,-which eyery sane man would desire to escape from 
as he would from blindness or deafness, the gout or the toothache. Even were 
ignorance, then, to be classed among the greatest luxuries of life, it would be found: 
too costly an indulgence to be borne by an economical people. 
The indispensableness of education to worldly prosperity has also been demon- 
strated. An ignorant people not only is but must be a poor people. . They must 
be destitute of sagacity and providence, and, of course, of competence and comfort. 
The proof of this does not depend upon the lessons of history, but on the constitution 
of nature. No richness of climate, no spontaneous productiveness of soil, no facilities

EDUCATION AND ORIME. 1251 
for commerce, no stores of gold or of diamonds garnered in the treasure chambers of 
the earth, can confer eyen worldly prosperity upon an uneducated nation. Such a 
nation can not create wealth of itself; and whatever riches may be showered upon 
it will run to waste. The ignorant pearl divers do not wear the pearls they win. 
The diamond hunters are not ornamented by the gems they find. The miners for 
silver and gold are not enriched by the precious metals they dig. Those who toil 
on the most luxuriant soils are not filled with the harvests they gather. All the 
choicest. productions of the earth, whether mineral or vegetable, wherever found or 
wherever gathered, will in a short time, as by some secret and resistless attraction, 
make their way into the hands of the more intelligent. Within the last four centu- 
ries the people of Spain have owned as much silver and gold asall the other nations 
of Europe put together, yet at the present time poor indeed is the people who have 
less than they. The nation which has produced more of the raw material and 
manufactured from it more fine linen than all contemporary nations is now the 
most ragged and squalid in Christendom. Let whoever will sow the seed or gather 
the fruit, Intelligence will consume the banquet. 
It must be admitted, indeed, that when the people composing any particular state 
or country are compared with each other, the wisest are not always the wealthiest. 
This natural law, like others, is liable to fluctuations and disturbances from artificial 
and arbitrary institutions. Primogeniture, entail, monopoly, may derange its action. 
Yet even here, as if to add confirmation to the general principle, it is always found 
that the families of inferior minds who inherit wealth, and the imbecile sovereigns 
or rulers who inherit power, owe their elevation to the greatness of some ances- 
tor, whose mental superiority not only won preeminence for himself, but for his 
descendants also. Where wealth or social position has not been earned or won by 
the possessors themselves, it is the representative of some ancestral talent whose 
force is not yet expended. : 
Who that visited the late Mechanics’ Fair in the city of Boston was not bewildered 
by the number and diversity of the products of inventive genius and skill there 
exhibited? To the common observer it was profusion producing confusion. What 
would be the result and ‘‘sum total’’. of a mechanics’ fair among a tribe in the inte- 
rior of Africa or among the aborigines of our Western wilderness? Hardly more than 
a stone hatchet, a flint-headed arrow, a stick burned at the end and sharpened into 
a spear, and afew yards of tawdry wampum. Yet the variety and richness of the 
one compared with the poverty arfd rudeness of the other would be but feeble sym- 
bols of the relative power and weakness of the minds from which they sprung. And 
whence came the vast, the wonderful intellectual superiority? It came from the old 
slate and pencil; the bit of chalk and the bit of board, planed or unplaned; the spell- 
ing book, and the reading book, which have been found in every household through 
all our borders from the time of the first rude huts that went up, amid winter and 
storm, about Plymouth Rock, which have been the companions and playthings of 
every nursery and the business things of every schoolroom for more than two cen- 
turies, until the children, as if by foree of hereditary instinct, seem to look round 
inquiringly after them almost as soon as they are born. These are the acorns whence 
the majestic forest has sprung. 
If the difference between persons dwelling in the same community and living side 
by side be less striking to the senses, it is not less instructive to the reason. In my 
fifth annual report I presented the testimony of some of the most eminent and suc- 
cessful business men amongst us, proving from business data and beyond controversy 
that labor becomes more profitable as the laborer is more intelligent, and that the 
true mint of wealth, the veritable coinage of the country, is not to be found in mag- 
nificent Government establishments, at Philadelphia or New Orleans, but in the hum- 
ple schoolhouse. 
On the occasion referred to one of our most sagacious manufacturers declared, not

  only in accordance with the conclusions of his own reason, but as the result of an 
actual experiment, that the best cotton mill in New England, if worked by opera- 
tives so low in the scale of intelligence as to be unable to read and write, would never 
yield the proprietor a profit—that the machinery would soon be worn out, the owner 
impoverished, and the operatives themselves left penniless. Another witness, for a 
Jong time superintendent of many work people, made the following striking remark: 
“So confident am I that production is affected by the intellectual and moral condi- 
tion of help that whenever a mill or a room should fail to give the proper amount of 
work my first inquiry, after that respecting the condition of the machinery, would be 
as to the character of the help, and if the deficiency remained any great length of 
time I am sure I should find many who had made their marks upon the pay roll, 
being unable to write their names; and I should be greatly disappointed if I did not, 
upon inquiry, find a portion of them of irregular habits and suspicious character.’ ! 
Is it not, in fact, most palpably demonstrable from a comparison of the nature of 
man with the powers and properties of the material universe in which he is placed 
that he was designed to reach a point of intellectual and moral elevation far higher 
than any which the most favored people on the earth have yet attained? A mate- 
rial world, active with such invisible energies and constantly displaying such fitful 
changes as belong to our planet, would be the most cruel prison house to beings 
capable of perceiving its aspects but incapable of understanding its laws. The 
superiority of our affective and sympathetic faculties over those possessed by the 
lower orders of creation would only render us so much the more miserable and 
defenseless if we had not the faculties of reason and judgment, also, by which we are 
able to bring ourselves into harmony with surrounding circumstances. Without 
knowledge our present lives would be far more wretched than those of the brutes 
which perish, for we should be vulnerable on all sides, capable of suffering the keen- 
ést pain while incapable of avoiding its causes. The revolution of the seasons would 
inflict want and debasement upon the whole race if we could not foresee their vicis- 
situdes and provide for their varying necessities. Comets and eclipses are fitted in 
their very natures to shed consternation and dismay upon the hearts of men until the 
intellect comes in to explain the sublime order that produces them.” 
To the savage, thunder and lightning are tokens of divine wrath; while to the 
Christian philosopher they are only emphatic and vivid proofs of the greatness and 
wisdom of God. To the enlightened mind a tempest ora whirlwind is only a tempest 
or a whirlwind; but a barbarian dreads them a thousand times more for the anger 
of the gods which they denote and for the evils they portend than for any actual 
injuries which they inflict. The auroras of the north, so beautiful to the eye of 
science, have shaken myriads of hearts with fear. That numerous and yaried class 
of phenomena which we call optical illusions are sources of the direst terror to the 
ignorant, while they gratify a philosophic curiosity with the purest delight. In short,

2It has been well said, “No eye has ever witnessed the spectacle of a total eclipse of the sun, even 
when announced with every characteristic of accuracy, without a shudder of awe, a sensation of deep 
terror, which reason in vain essays to subdue. The chilling and somber darkness which spreads over 
nature; the manifest terror of birds and animals; their instinctive retreat to the abodes of man, as if 
some awful danger was impending; the horror of the idea of the destruction of the great source of 
light and life, and the possible dissolution of nature—all conspire to render thisone of the most terrific 
scenes that the eye of man has ever witnessed. What, then, must have been the horror which seized 
every spectator of this awful scene in those ages of the world when profound ignorance of its physi- 
cal causes existed, and this terrible phenomenon burst suddenly upon the world, unanticipated and 
unannounced? 
“The great Roman historian and annalist has, in a few graphic sentences, depicted the effect of an 
eclipse of the moon on the devoted legions of Pannonia. These hardy veterans, these iron men, 
born and bred to battle and to war, cowered before the awful spectacle, marched in agony to their 
contemned commanders and implored their forgiveness and deprecated the wrath of the avenging 
gods for their disobedience and insubordination.”—Sidereal Messenger.

  EDUCATION AND ORIME. 12538 
we know that all the wonders and glories which nature displays in her majestic 
course are only sources of superstition to those who have not learned her sublime 
laws—darkening the already darkened mind, debasing the debased, and terrifying 
the affrighted. It seems impossible that a benevolent Being could have gifted the 
human race with its high faculties if He had not provided for and ordained their 
development and education. All the other orders of animated nature are adapted 
to their condition; but a human soul, quickened by irrepressible impulses of curi- 
osity, subject to the illusions of hope and to the agonies of fear, but with no power 
to unriddle the mysteries by which it is encompassed—with no power to realize the 
hopes spontaneously springing up within it or to emancipate itself from the bondage 
of fear—such a soul would be forever the trembling slave of nature, while nature 
would be a tyrant over it, deaf and remorseless. Whatever name might be given to 
the place of its habitation, it would be a habitation of unquenchable fire. 
Knowledge and a highly developed and highly trained reason are to the temporal 
necessities of man what instinct is to the brute. But instinct is complete, perfect, 
self-active; while knowledge and reason can never reach any adequate height with- 
out vigorous self-effort and copious instruction from others. Far better, therefore, 
would it have been for mankind had they never been elevated in the scale of exist- 
ence aboye the simian tribe—the ape, the monkey, or the baboon—than that they 
should have been endowed with the faculties of memory, of hope, of fear, and of 
imagination, without an adequate ability to derive wisdom from past experience 
and to make provision for future necessities. There is no earthly power but educa- 
tion which, by supplying these wants, can rescue the human race from sinking as 
much below the brute creation as they were designed to rise above it. 
So, too, if the practice of equity, virtue, and benevolence were not possible for the 
race, its condition would be far more deplorable than that of any horde of wild beasts 
that ever prowled through a wilderness or hid themselves for ambush in the depths 
of ajungle. Even tigers and wolves, with all their ferocity, can inflict but a transi- 
tory pain upon each other or upon the weaker races around them. The most ingen- 
ious of all the animals have never invented machines to torture those of their own 
or of an inferior order. The iron boot, the thumbscrew,, the rack, the fagot, are 
dreadful realities in natural history, but the infamy of their invention and their use 
belongs not to the brute creation. Brutes can not build ships and cross oceans to 
despoil or enslave a defenseless and kindred race in another hemisphere, nor can 
they forge any fetters, whether of iron or of law, which shall bind in remorseless 
bondage not only the victim himself, but generations of his descendants. Brutes can 
not bereaye each other of their natural instincts, make the mother forget her young, 
the mated pair assail each other’s lives, or the offspring lay parricidal hands upon its 
parent, by transforming the choicest fruits of the earth into poison, and selling this 
poison for ignominious gain. The most selfish and ignoble races that ever flew 
through the air or swam in the sea never availed themselves of the accidental posses- 
sion of power to establish orders of patrician and plebeian, or of lord and commoner, 
and thus to doom one portion of their number to perform all the toil and bear all the 
burdens of the tribe while they themselves monopolized all its leisure and its lux- 
uries. What a spectacle would be presented if a few individuals of some family of 
insects, gathering themselves into conclave upon some spire of grass in the middle of 
a vast plain, or upon some leaf in a boundless forest, should there presume, not only 
to adjudicate upon all the purposes of creation and all the mysteries of eternity, but 
should denounce imprisonment and torture, the fagot and the scaffold, upon all who 
would not bow to their authority and vow assent to their conclusions. There are 
tribes of the brute creation, it is true, which prey upon other tribes, but it is only for 
the satisfaction of a physical want, and when their hunger is appeased their fierceness 
subsides; but not in the north, where their rage is whetted by arctic cold, nor in the 
south, where their blood is fevered by tropical heats, do they ever inflict upon a victim   
 
-P-A-G-E-14

the life-long solitude of a dungeon or gratuitously burn his body and heap contempt 
upon his ashes for not believing as they believe, or for not acknowledging as the Great 
Spirit of the universe the idol which they may have set up. If, then, I say, it had 
not been a part of the divine determination in the creation of our race that its terri- 
ble propensities should be controlled and its higher susceptibilities advanced into 
supremacy, zoology has yet to discover the species of animals so vile, so wretched, so 
mutually predaceous, that mankind has not reason to envy them. If posterity is to 
be what history shows us that nineteen-twentieths of all the preceding world have 
been, what not less than four-fifths of it now are, then is man not the noblest but the 
ignoblest work of creation, the accursed and not the fayored of heaven. Not believing 
in such a destiny, I believe there is a way to avoid it. 
Having proved, then, in former reports, by the testimony of wise and skilled men, 
that disease may be supplanted by health, bodily pain by enjoyment, and premature 
death by length of life, merely by the knowledge and practice of a few great physio- 
logical principles, such as every person can easily master before the age of sixteen 
years; and having also shown, by testimony equally authentic and satisfactory, that 
intelligence, cooperating with the bounties of nature, is sufficient to secure comfort 
and competence to all mankind, I propose to myself in the residue of this report 
the still more delightful task of showing, by proofs equally unexceptionable and con- 
vincing, that the great body of vices and crimes which now sadden and torment the 
community may be dislodged and driven out from amongst us by such improve- 
ments in our present common-school system as we are abundantly able immediately 
to make. 
During the last summer, in order to a clear and full presentation of the subject 
to those persons whose testimony I wished to obtain, I prepared a circular setting 
forth, with as much precision and completeness as possible, certain specific emenda- 
tions of our present school system—only such emendations, however, as we can 
readily make—and appealing to the experience and judgment of the persons addressed, 
to know what would be the results were the system to be so amended. Thiscircular 
was sent to teachers highly competent to give evidence on so important a subject— 
competent, from their science and from their personal experience, from the sobriety 
of their judgment and from their freedom from any motive to overstate facts, or to 
deduce inferences too broad for the premises on which they were founded. In fine, 
the circular was sent to persons whose elevated character and whose extended per- 
sonal acquaintance with the subject-matter on which they testify place them above 
denial, cavil, or suspicion. 
The circular and the answer to it follow: 
Crrcunar. 
To “ 
I desire to obtain the opinion of teachers who are both scientific and practical on 
a subject of great importance to the cause of popular education. Your long experi- 
ence in school keeping, the great number of children whom you have had under 
your care, and your well-earned reputation as an instructor and trainer of youth 
prompt me to apply to you for answers to the subjoined inquiries. 
My general object is to obtain such an opinion as your experience will authorize 
you to give respecting the efficiency in the formation of social and moral character of 
a good common-school education, conducted on the cardinal principles of the New 
England systems. In other words, how much of improvement in the upright con- 
duct and good morals of the community might we reasonably hope and expect if all 
our common schools were what they should be, what some of them now are, and 
what all of them, by means which the public is perfectly able to command, may soon 
be made to become? 
As we look around us we see that society is infested by vices both small and great. 
The value of life is diminished, and even life itself is sometimes made burdensome 
and odious by the existence amongst us of pests and nuisances in human form, whom 
the law forbids us to destroy, and whom, with all our efforts, we are unable wholly    
-P-A-G-E-15
  EDUCATION AND CRIME. 1255 
to reform. Were we permitted to hunt out and exterminate from society a wicked 
or mischievous man as we would a prowling wolf from the sheepfold, or could we 
apply the sovereign antidote of extinction to a pestilent brood of children whom 
profligate parents are about to send forth into the world, we might then secure our- 
selves in a summary manner from present fears and from future annoyance. So, too, if 
we could arrest the momentum of long habit or win back to the paths of virtue those 
who by their frequent tread have worn the highways of vice both smooth and broad, 
we should then have access to a milder though a more laborious remedy. But the 
common sentiments of mankind would revolt at any proposal to prevent all viola- 
tions of the moral code by extinguishing the life of the violators; and all history and 
experience afford concurrent proof that the inbred habits of grown men and women, 
their accustomed trains of thought and of action, are mainly beyond the control of 
secondary causes. Hence it is that a great part of the legislation of every State and 
nation, a vast majority of the decisions of all legal tribunals, and a still larger pro- 
portion of all the labors and expenditures of philanthropic and Christian men have 
been devoted to the punishment of positive wrong or to the vain attempt to repair 
its nameless and numberless mischiefs. Could these wrongs and mischiefs be pre- 
vented our descendants would inherit a new earth. 
The classes of common offenses by which society is vexed and tormented are 
numerous, but the individual acts of commission under the respective classes are 
absolutely incomprehensible save by the Omniscient. 
There is the detestable practice of profane swearing, which is motiveless and gra- 
tuitous wickedness. This is a vice which neither gives any property to the poor 
man nor any luxury to the rich one. It degrades even the clown to a lower state of 
vulgarity, and it would render the presence even of the most polished gentleman 
offensive and disgusting, if it were ever possible for a gentleman to be guilty of it. 
Though greatly restricted at the present day in its destructive agency and gradu- 
ally withdrawing itself from the more respectable and intelligent classes to the two 
extremes of society, to the luxuriously rich and the self-made poor, yet the vice of 
intemperance still exists amongst us. Wherever it invades it eats out the substance 
of families, not only consumes the means of educating children, but eradicates also 
the very disposition to educate them; involves the innocent in the sufferings of the 
uilty, even torturing them with superadded pangs of shame which the guilty do not 
Feel, and, according to the divinely ordained laws of our physical being, it visits the 
iniquities of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation by 
sowing in their constitution the seeds of inordinate desires. 
Below that degree of slander or defamation which the law denounces as punish- 
able there exists such an amount of censoriousness and detraction as often estranges 
acquaintances, dissolves friendships, introduces discord into neighborhoods and com- 
munities, and sometimes entails hereditary animosities upon families and circles 
which might otherwise be blessed by harmony and peace. 
Nor can the gross and cowardly offense of lying be omitted from this odious cata- 
logue. This vice includes in its very nature so much of the assassin and the dastard 
that it lurks to inflict secret blows or only ventures abroad when large numbers, 
bound together by strong ties of passion or of interest, impart mutual confidence and 
boldness in the prosecution of a common object. Hence a private individual who-is 
known as a liar is detested, scorned, and shunned, while profligate political defamers 
and sectarian zealots, inspired by a common sentiment of ambition or of intolerance 
and keeping themselves in countenance by their numbers and their partisanship, 
welcome this vice as an ally and rejoice in the successes obtained by its aid. No 
patriotism is proof against the rancor of party spirit, no piety or good works against 
the rage and Hinder of religious bigotry. 
In pecuniary transactions, the temptations to overreaching, to exorbitance, and to 
actual dishonesty are yielded to with a most lamentable frequency. The buyer 
takes advantage of the necessities of the seller, and obtains a transfer of his property 
for a small part of its value; or sometimes, by adroit management and preliminary 
scheming, he creates the necessity which places the victim within the jaws of his 
avarice. The seller knowingly overstates the quantity, the quality, or the value of 
the commodities he sells; and perhaps takes advantage of the ignorance or credulity 
of the purchaser to obtain a price which he knows to be exorbitant and inequitable. 
The employer often avails himself of the necessities of the employed to obtain his 
services for less than they are worth; he summons in hunger, and cold, and the suf- 
ferings of a dependent family, as advisers in helping to make an unrighteous bargain, 
and as sureties for its performance. Men eaten any pecuniary resources which 
they can call their own embark in hazardous speculations, where, if the rash adyen- 
ture should chance to prove successful, they will pocket all the gain; but should it 
turn out to be disastrous, their creditors must suffer all the loss.   
   
-P-A-G-E-16
1256 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
  In some of the commercial countries of Europe, a merchant’s insolvency affects his 
moral character hardly less than his pecuniary credit. If a bankrupt can not show 
that his deficiency of means was occasioned by some disaster which he could not 
control, or by some loss which he could not reasonably be expected to foresee, he 
forfeits his mercantile standing amongst honorable dealers, and can retrieve his 
character only by actual proof of returning or of newly created honesty. A second 
failure, unexplained and unatoned for, brands with disgrace, and expels not more 
from the traffic than from the companionship of honorable men. 
The above classes of wrongdoing, together with many others of a kindred nature, 
are regarded by the law as minor offences. Some of them it does not undertake to 
punish; yet, from their widespread prevalence and great frequency, they perhaps 
inflict as large an aggregate of evil upon society as those of a more heinous and for- 
midable character, but of less frequent occurrence. 
In regard to offences of a graver nature—such as come under the head of crimes or 
felonies—the condition of our country compares favorably with that of any other part 
of Christendom. Especially will this remark appear true, if we consider the slight 
amount of preventive force made use of in any part of our Union to deter from actual 
transgression; and as a general rule the lightness of the penal sanctions held up as a 
terror to evildoers. Yet that there does exist amongst us an appalling amount of 
criminality of this deeper dye; that flagrant offences against the rights of property, 
of person, of reputation, and of life are perpetrated, is proved by the records of our 
criminal courts, and by the mournful procession of convicts and felons, whom we see 
on their way to our penitentiaries and other receptacles prepared for the guilty. 
Including all classes of offenders, both the less and the more flagitious, it is unde- 
niable that there exists amongst us a multitude of men of whom it may be truly said, 
that it would be better for the community had they never been born; or had they 
died in childhood before their propensities for evil had been developed, or before 
they had gone abroad to disturb the peace of society, and to destroy that sense of 
security which every honest man is entitled to feel. To thin the ranks of this host 
of enemies to the welfare of the race, or to cripple the evil energies of those who 
could not be wholly reclaimed, has been the object of philanthropists and sages from 
the beginning of time. Their efforts, however, have been expended a million fold 
more upon the old than upon the young; and a million fold more, also, in the way 
of punishment than of prevention. 
Among the republics of ancient times, a few wise and sagacious men did clearly 
perceive the bearing of education upon character; and, of course, upon innocence and 
guilt, both personal and public; but among the masses of the people there never 
existed any settled and operative conviction of this truth; and not a single year can 
be pointed out in all their long annals, where a majority of those who held the reins 
of government, and framed the laws of the State, rose to any practical or even theo- 
retical conception of the grand idea, that the vital intelligence or the stupidity, the 
integrity or the dishonesty of the people at large, will be measured and bounded by the 
kind and degree of the education imparted to its children, just as the zones upon the 
earth’s surface are measured and bounded by the amount of sunlight which is shed 
upon them.* 
“In modern times this relation of early education to adult character has been more 
clearly and generally recognized as being what it truly to a very great extent is, a 
relation between cause and effect. As one means of establishing this truth, many 
earnest well-wishers of their race have made extensive collections of what are called 
the ‘‘Statistics of Education and Crime.’’ The inmates of large penal establishments 
haye been subjected to a personal examination, in order to ascertain whether a 
greater portion of them, than of the community at large from which they were taken, 
were wholly ignorant of letters. In this investigation the comparison has been 
made between those who were able both to read and write, and those who could 
perform neither or but one of these operations. 
I will not dwell here upon the amazing absurdity of any definition of the word 
“education,’’ whose spirit or whose terms are satisfied by the mere ability to read 
and write. Reading and writing may be, and among this class of persons they 
usually are, mere mechanical processes; and how such attainments should eyer have 
been dignified by the name of education, or confounded with that noble culture of 
the soul which pours the noonday illumination of knowledge upon the midnight 
darkness of ignorance, which seeks to enthrone the moral faculties over all animal 
desires and propensities, and to make the entire course of instruction subservient to 
the great duties of love to God and love to man—how an absurdity so extravagant

denied the possibility of establishing Plato’s republic.
-P-A-G-E-17
  EDUCATION AND CRIME. 1257 
and now so obvious could ever have been committed can be explained only by refer- 
ence to the low and unworthy ideas of edutation which once prevailed. 
The naked capacity to read and write is no more education than a tool is a work- 
man, or a telescope is a Laplace or a Le Verrier. To possess the means of education 
is not the same as to possess the lofty powers and immunities of education, any more 
than to possess the pen of a poet is to possess a poet’s skill and ‘faculty divine; or 
than the possession of the Gospel is the possession of that liberty wherewith Christ 
maketh his disciples free; and, that reading and writing are only instruments or 
means to be used in education, is a truism now so intuitively obvious as to disdain 
argument. And hence it is, that, of two persons one of whom can barely write his 
name or spell out a paragraph in a newspaper, while, to the mind of the other, the 
contents of all manuscripts and ofall libraries have no more existence than nonentity 
has to his senses, it would be hazardous to affirm that the chances of the former for 
a virtuous life are much superior to those of the latter. Nor do the best authorities 
dispel all the clouds of doubt which hang over this question. Some writers main- 
tain that crime actually increases in proportion to the diffusion of the rudiments of 
knowledge, provided the knowledge which is diffused stops with mere rudiments. 
I think, however, it must be conceded that the preponderance of names and of sta- 
tistical results does, on the whole, clearly favor the opinion that crime recedes as 
knowledge advances; and that, as the full-risen sun enables a traveller to see his 
path and to avoid the dangers that beset it, so the first and faintest_gleaming of the 
morning twilight he!ps him to discover his way and to shun its perils. It must also- 
be remembered, that when great numbers are taken as the basis of comparison, all 
of whom possess the rudiments of knowledge, it will always happen that some of 
them will possess more than the rudiments. Hence, taking whole communities. 
together, I believe the legitimate and inevitable conclusion to be that every advance 
in knowledge amongst a people is pro tanto an invasion of the domain of crime. 
For years past, however, although I have carefully scrutinized these so-called 
“Statistics of Education and Crime,” and am convinced that they do establish a dis- 
tinction between the two classes—one of which can read and write, while the other 
can do neither of these things or but one of them—in regard to their relative exemp- 
tion from crime, or exposure to it, yet I have never been able to bring myself to pre- 
sent these schedules to our people, as an argument in favor of that elevated and 
ennobling education to which it is their duty to aspire. I have felt that, by so doing, 
the argument would be shorn of half its power by the feebleness of the proofs brought 
to sustain it. It would be like exhibiting a taper to prove the existence of light, 
while surrounded by the sun’s effulgence. Our present state of society, the form of 
government under which we live, the improyable faculties with which we have been 
endowed by our Maker, and the solemn destiny that awaits us, all demand vastly 
more than ‘‘a knowledge of the nature and power of letters, and the just method of 
spelling words,” and the mechanical ability to imitate, with a pen, their written of 
printed signs. 
Yet this degrading idea of education, which was first conceived in reference to the 
ignorant classes of Europe, has been, to some extent, adopted and acted upon in our 
own country. The last census of the United States, taken by authority of a law of 
Congress, and in compliance with a provision of the Federal constitution, proceeded 
upon this European fallacy. It virtually adopted the old line of distinction between 
education and ignorance, for it required an enumeration of all persons over twenty 
years of age who were unable to read and write. The results have been published 
and they are now embodied with the permanent statistics of the country. Towns, 
counties, and States are classed, their condition is mentioned with honor or with 
opprobrium, according to their relative position above or below this absurd standard 
of knowledge and culture. It is inevitable that this legislative sanction of such a. 
standard—this naturalization of it, so to speak—should have a most baneful effect 
in debasing public opinion upon the subject. Facts of an interesting nature are pre- 
sented, it is true, but their tendency is to rob education of all its Bape attributes. 
But though the public mind always tends strongly to conform its modes of think- 
ing to legal definitions, and to subscribe to opinions sanctioned by high authority, 
yet the common sense of the community, especially in the more educated States of 
the Union, has outgrown these contracted notions, and has claimed for the word 
education a far ampler and loftier significance. All intelligent thinkers upon this 
subject now utterly discard and repudiate the idea that reading and writing, with a. 
knowledge of accounts, constitute education. The lowest claim which any intelli- 
gent man now prefers in its behalf is, that its domain extends over the threefold 
nature of man—oyer his body, training it by the systematic and intelligent observ- 
ance of those benign laws which secure health, impart strength, and prolong life; 
over his intellect, invigorating the mind, replenishing it with knowledge, and culti-  
-P-A-G-E-18
1258 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
  vating all those tastes which are allied to virtue; and over his moral and religious 
susceptibilities also, dethroning selfishness, enthroning conscience, leading the affec- 
tions outward in good will toward men, and upward in gratitude and reverence to 
God. In thousands of reports, prepared by school committees; infrequent addresses 
and lectures, delivered on public occasions; in all educational documents emanating 
from high official sources; and in every work pretending to scientific aceuracy, or to 
any comprehensive outline of the subject, these sacred and majestic attributes have 
been set forth; and it has been demonstrated, hundreds of times over, that the effect 
of a sound education of the people must, not accidentally but necessarily, not ocea- 
sionally but always, be, to repress the commission of crime and to promote the diffu- 
sion of human happiness; and that to act in conscious defiance or disregard of these 
truths is treachery to the best interests of our fellow men, and impiety towards the 
Author of the moral universe. 
But, notwithstanding all that has been said, and so well said, as to the moral power 
of education in reforming the world, there have still been a vagueness and an indefi- 
niteness in regard to the extent of that power which have shorn argument and elo- 
quence of much of their strength. Nowhere have its advocates set forth distinctly 
and specifically how much they believe can be accomplished by it. When an alleged 
improvement is presented to a judicious man, he wishes to know whether and to 
what extent its benefit will exceed its cost. A capitalist will not aid a new enter- 
prise with his money until he is satisfied of the profitableness of the investment, 
nor will a manufacturer purchase new machinery unless he is conyinced that it will 
do better work in the same time or equal work in less. 
It seems to me that the time is now arrived when the friends of this cause should 
plant themselyes on a more conspicuous position, when, surveying the infinite of 
wretchedness and crime around them, before which the stoutest heart is appalled 
and humanity stands aghast, they should proclaim the power and the prerogatives of 
education to rescue mankind from their calamities. Founding themselves upon evi- 
dence that can not be disputed, and fortifying their conclusions by the results of per- 
sonal experience, they should proclaim how far the miseries of men can be alleviated 
and how far the dominion of crime can be overthrown by such a system of education 
as it is perfectly practicable for every civilized community forthwith to establish, and 
thus they should awaken the conscience of the public to a sense of its responsibility. 
The idea will be more distinctly presented under an inquiry like the following: 
Under the soundest and most vigorous system of education which we can now com- 
mand, what proportion or percentage of all the children who are born can be made 
useful and exemplary men—honest dealers, conscientious jurors, true witnesses, 
incorruptible voters or magistrates, good parents, good neighbors, good members of 
society? In other words, with our present knowledge of the art and science of edu- 
cation, and with such new fruit of experience as time may be expected to bear, what 
roportion or percentage of all children must be pronounced irreclaimable and irre- 
Hesranbles notwithstanding the most vigorous educational efforts which in the pres- 
ent state of society can be put forth in their behalf; what proportion or percentage 
must become drunkards, profane swearers, detractors, vagabonds, rioters, cheats, 
thieves, aggressors upon the rights of property, of persons, of reputations, or of life; 
or, ina single phrase, must be guilty of such omissions of right and commissions of 
wrong that it would have been better for the community had they never been born? 
This is a problem which the course of events has evolved, and which society and the 
Government must meet. If, with such educational means and resources as we can 
now command, 80, 90, 95, or 99 per cent of all children can be made temperate, 
industrious, frugal, conscientious in all their dealings, prompt to pity and instruct 
ignorance instead of ridiculing it and taking advantage of it, public spirited, philan- 
thropic, and observers of all things sacred; if, I say, any given proportion of our 
children, by human efforts and by such a divine blessing as the common course of 
God’s providence authorizes us to expect, can be made to possess these qualities and 
to act irom them, then just so far as our posterity shall fall below this practicable 
exemption from vice and crimes, and just so far as they shall fail to possess these 
attainable virtues, just so far will those who frame and execute our laws, shape pub- 
lic opinion and lead public action be criminally responsible for the difference. I 
can conceive of no moral proposition clearer than this. Society, in its collective 
capacity, is the possessor of all the knowledge and the owner of all the property in 
existence. Governments have been organized and are invested with power to use 
any needful amount of this property for purposes of education, and by holding out 
adequate inducements and remuneration they can command the services of the 
highest talent. Here, then, duty and the means to perform it come together. The 
only remaining question is how much can be done? For in a cause and for a pur- 
     
 
-P-A-G-E-19
EDUCATION AND ORIME. 1259 
  pose like this nothing which can actually be done can be guiltlessly omitted. If it 
is proved with a reasonable degree of certainty that 99, 95, 90, 80, or any other given 
percentage of all children, can be rescued from vice and crime and can be so educated 
and trained as to become valuable citizens but the State refuses or declines to do this 
work, then the State itself becomes a culprit, and before the great Moral Judge who 
is seated on the throne of the universe it must stand a spectacle of shame and guilt, 
like one of its own inferior culprits before its own judicial tribunals. 
With these preliminary observations, which seemed _ to be necessary in order to a 
full exposition of the object I haye in view, I proceed to submit the following spe- 
cific inquiries, and to request your answer to them: 
1. How many years have you been engaged in school keeping, and whether in the 
country or in populous towns or cities? 
2. About how many children haye you had under your care, of which sex, and 
between what ages? 
38. Should all our schools be kept by teachers of high intellectual and moral quali- 
fications, and should all the children in the community be brought within these 
schools for ten months in a year, from the age of 4 to that of 16 years; then, what 
proportion, what percentage, of such children as you have had under your care 
could, in your opinion, be so educated and trained that their existence on going out 
into the world would be a benefit and not a detriment, an honor and not a shame, to 
society? Or, to state the question in a general form, if all children were brought 
within the salutary and auspicious influences I have here supposed, what percentage 
of them should you pronounce to be irreclaimable and hopeless? Of course, I do not 
speak of imbeciles or idiots, but only of rational and accountable beings. 
You will perceive that in certain respects I am supposing no change in the present 
condition of society. Iam taking families as they are now, and am allowing all the 
unfavorable as well as the favorable influences of the old upon the young to continue 
to operate, at least for a time, as heretofore. Nor do I suppose any sudden or trans- 
forming change in cooperative or auxiliary institutions—such as the Sabbath school, 
the pulpit, and so forth—although it is certain that such a state of things as is here 
outlined would gradually impart new vigor to all that advances the progress of society, 
while it would impair the force of all that retards it. 
On the other hand, however, I am supposing two great changes. I am supposing 
all our children to be placed under the care of such a class of men and women as we 
now honor by the appellation of first-class or first-rate teachers, of such teachers as 
are able in the schoolroom, both to teach and to govern, and who, out of the school- 
room, will beanimated by a missionary spirit in furthering the objects of their sacred 
vocation. I have also supposed that all the children in the community shall be 
brought under the forming hands of such teachers, from the age of 4 to that of 16, 
ten months in each year. 
While, therefore, the above supposition leayes children exposed in many cases to 
the pernicious family and social influences} under which they are now suifering, it 
assumes that all the children, when out of school, shall meet only such children as 
are enjoying the same high training, the same daily instillation of moral principles 
as themselves. My supposition allows a continuance of the same family and adult 
influences, at least until these shall be supplanted by the better influences of the ris- 
ing generation, action and reaction hastening results, because these influences are 
facts which no earthly power can cause to be immediately changed. But I have 
supposed this noble company of teachers, this length of schools, and this universality 
of attendance, because these are reforms on the present condition of things which 
can be effected without any great delay, at the furthest a very few years being an 
ample allowance for the completion of such a change. 
To reduce my third question, then, within its narrowest limits and to make it as 
definite and precise as possible, suppose yourself to be stationed as a school teacher 
in a place similar to any of those in which you have before labored; suppose your- 
self, too, to be surrounded by teachers fully as capable and as zealous in all respects 
as yourself; and suppose, further, that all the children are brought under your care 
or theirs, as above specified—that is, for a period of twelve years, or from 4 to 16, 
and ten months in each year, and will you then please to declare what proportion or 
ercentage of those under your own care you believe could be turned out, the bless- 
ing and not the bane, the honor and not the scandal, of society; and on what pro- 
portion or percentage—the complement of the other—would your experience compel 
you to pronounce the doom of hopelessness and irreclaimability? 
Very truly and sincerely, yours, etc.,

I extract from the replies to this circular only the specific answers to the circular. 
Letter from John Griscom, esq. 
Buruerton, N. J,, August 27, 1847. 
My Esteemep Frienp: * * * : 
My belief is that, under the conditions mentioned in the question, not more than 
2 per cent would be irreclaimable nuisances to society, and that 95 per cent would be 
supporters of the moral welfare of the community in which they resided. 
With teachers properly trained in normal schools, and with such a popular dispo- 
sition toward schools as wise legislation might effect, nineteen-twentieths of the 
immoralities which afflict society might, I verily believe, be kept under hatches, or 
eradicated from the soil of our social institutions. 
Eyery step in such a progress renders the next more easy.» This is proved not only 
on the grand scale of comparing country with country, and state with state, but 
district with its adjacent district, and neighborhood with neighborhood. 
Finally, in the predicament last.stated in the circular, and supposing the teachers 
to be imbued with the Gospel spirit, I believe there would not be more than one- 
half of one per cent of the children educated, on whom a wise judge would be 
“compelled to pronounce the doom of hopelessness and irreclaimability.”’ 
In nothing which I have advanced has it been my intention to advocate any sec- 
tarian instruction in our schools; or anything adverse to the statutory limits of the 
Massachusetts school system. I therefore expressly disavow any intention to 
recommend truths or doctrines as part of the moral instruction to be given in public 
schools, which any believer in the Bible would reasonably deem to be sectarian.

Hon. Horace Mann, 
Dear Sia) * F< * 
Could I be connected with a school furnished with all the appliances you name, 
where all the children should be constant attendants upon my instruction for a suc- 
cession of years; where all my fellow-teachers should be such as you suppose, and 
where all the favorable influences described in your circular should surround me 
and cheer me, even with my moderate abilities as a teacher, I should scarcely expect, 
after the first generation of children submitted to the experiment, to fail, in a single 
case, to secure the results you have named. * * * 
But I should not forgive myself, nor think myself longer fit to be a teacher, if, 
with all the aids and influences you have supposed, I should fail, in one case ina 
hundred, to rear up children who, when they should become men, would be ‘ honest 
dealers, conscientious'jurors, true witnesses, incorruptible voters or magistrates, good 
parents, good neighbors, good members of society,’ or, as you express it in another 
place, who-would be ‘‘ temperate, industrious, frugal, conscientious in all their deal- 
ings, prompt to pity and instruct ignorance, instead of ridiculing it and taking advan- 
tage of it, public-spirited, philanthropic, and observers of all things sacred;’’ and, 
negatively, who would not be ‘“‘drunkards, profane swearers, detractors, vagabonds, 
rioters, cheats, thieves, aggressors upon the rights of property, of person, of reputa- 
tion or of life, or guilty of such omissions of right and commissions of wrong that it 
would be better for the community had they never been born.” * * *

My Dear Sir: * *- * 
1. I have been engaged in this profession twenty-four years. The first five years 
in the country, the remainder of the time in a city. 
2. My whole number of pupils is a little below two thousand. The last nineteen 
years my pupils have been females. Previously, both sexes. * * * 
Ifa well-conducted education produces benevolence, justice, truth, patriotism, love 
to God, and love to man, in one case, the same education, in the same circum-
-P-A-G-E-21
  y EDUCATION AND CRIME. 1261 
stances, will produce the same results in all cases. The results for which we look 
and labor sometimes fail, not because the great law of uniformity is at fault, but by 
reason of counteracting causes which may escape our most careful scrutiny. Does 
the failure impair our confidence in the uniformity of moral causes and effects? The 
moment the law fails, every cord that binds society together is sundered; society is 
disintegrated. Every social enactment by which society attempts to regulate its 
members, every motive by which one man hopes to influence another, assumes this 
uniformity. It is the hinge on which all social influences turn. Without it we could 
not shape moral means to moral ends. To destroy it—to doubt it—would be the 
moral unhingement of society. 
In this great law are the teacher’s hopes and encouragements. The great outline 
of the means he is to employ is well defined. It is his province to bring all those 
moral appliances to bear upon the soul, which are suited to lead it into harmony with 
truth and with God—to train it to the perception and love of truth and goodness. In 
doing this the faithful teacher is a coworker with God, and may confidently look to 
the Author of all good to give the crowning blessing to his strenuous endeavors. 
There are those (and I confess myself of the number) who believe and feel that all 
human endeavors, unaided by an influence from on high, will prove fruitless so far 
as the highest wants of the immortal spirit are concerned. Yet those who feel so 
can tell us of no way in which they are authorized to expect such an influence, and 
of no way in which it is exerted even by almighty power, except through the 
instrumentality of truth presented to the mind. There might as well be a conflagra- 
tion without fire, or a flood without fluid. ‘i 
I confess I do not see how our different theological views can essentially alter our 
modes of instruction. We are all to train the young in the way in which they should 
go, ‘giving line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little,” 
waiting for and expecting precious fruit. The fruit may ripen slowly. From day to 
day you may not be able to see any progress. This holds true both in moral and in- 
tellectual training. But by comparing distant intervals progress is perceptible. At 
length a result comes which repays all the teacher’s labor and inspires new courage 
for new efforts. You ask for my own experience. This is my apology for alluding 
with freedom to myseli. Permit me to say that in very many cases, after laboring 
Jong with individuals almost against hope and sometimes in a manner, too, which I 
can now see was not always wise, I have never had a case which has not resulted in 
some goud degree according to my wishes. The many kind and voluntary testimo- 
nials given years afterwards by persons who remembered that they were once my 
wayward pupils are among the pleasantest and most cheering incidents of my life. 
So uniform have been the results that I have unhesitatingly adopted the motto, 
“ Never despair.’’? Parents and teachers are apt to look for too speedy results from 
the labors of the latter. The moral nature, like the intellectual and physical, is long 
and slow in reaching the full maturity of its strength. I was told a few years since, 
by a gentleman who knew the history of nearly all my pupils for the first five years 
of my labor, that not one of them had ever brought reproach upon himself or mor- 
tification upon friends by a bad life. I can not now look over the whole list of my 
pupilsand find one who had been with me long enough to receive a decided impres- 
sion whose life is not honorable and useful. I find them in all the learned profes- 
sions and in the various mechanical arts. I find my female pupils scattered as 
teachers through half the States of the Union, and as the wives and assistants of 
Christian missionaries in every quarter of the globe. 
So far, therefore, as my own experience goes, so far as my knowledge of the expe- 
rience of others extends, so far as the statistics of crime throw any light on the subject, 
I should confidently expect that ninety-nine in a hundred, and I think even more, 
with such means of education as you have supposed and with such divine favor as we 
are authorized to expect, would become good members of society, the supporters of 
order and law and truth and justice and all righteousness. 
That I may not be misunderstood, allow me to add a few explanatory remarks. 
I have no confidence in the reformatory power of education into which moral and 
religious influences do not enter. I assume—as anyone haying the slightest acquaint- 
ance with your writings and teachings on this subject knows that you do—that the 
three great classes of powers—the physical, intellectual, and moral—shall each 
receive its proper training; and then I feel authorized to look confidently for that 
providential blessing which will secure the high results already alluded to. Without 
such a training I haye no right to expect the blessing of Heaven or a good result; I 
do not fulfill the conditions on which such results are promised. * * * 
It is to be feared, yea, to be for a lamentation, that comparatively few of teachers 
and still fewer of the community have looked upon a school education as anything 
more than a very limited intellectual training, leaving physical and moral culture to  
-P-A-G-E-22

take care of themselves. The school laws of Massachusetts have always contemplated | 
other attainments and vastly higher ends. Yet it so happens that that part of the 
law has been best remembered and acted upon which speaks of reading, writing, and 
the elements of arithmetic. These have been insisted on chiefly with reference to 
their direct application to the business and traffic of life, as if it were the chief end 
of man to count coppers, pocket them, and keep them. While the law contemplates 
these elementary attainments as merely the beginnings and inlets to all the treasures 
of wisdom, how many have looked upon them as the education of the boy and 
the man! * * * 
Very truly, your friend and obedient servant, 
S. Apams. 
Letier from Rev. Jacob Abbott. 
New York Crry, June 25, 1847. 
Hon. Horace Many, 
Dae Sirah tk, 
1. I have been engaged in the practical duties of teaching for about ten years, 
chiefly in private schools in Boston and New York. 
2. I have had under my care, for a longer or shorter time, probably nearly eight 
hundred pupils. They have been of both sexes, and of all ages from four to twenty- 
fiv ec. 
3. If all our schools were under the charge of teachers possessing what I regard as 
the right intellectual and moral qualifications, and if all the children of the commu- 
nity were brought under the influence of these schools for ten months in the year, I 
think that the work of training up the whole community to intelligence and virtue 
would soon be accomplished, as completely as any human end can be obtained by 
human means. ‘ 
I do not think, however, that, so far as the formation of the habits of virtue in the 
oung is concerned, the accomplishment of the result depends either upon the intel- 
feces powers or attainments of the teacher, or upon the amount of formal moral 
instructions which he gives his pupils. Knowledge alone has but little tendency to 
affect the feelings and principles of the heart; and formal moral instructions, except 
as auxiliaries to other influences, have very little power, according to my experience, 
over the consciences and characters of the young. 
The true power of the teacher in giving to his pupils good characters in future life, 
seems to me to lie in his forming them to the practice of virtue, while under his 
charge, by the influence of his own personal character and actions. To do this, 
however, he must have the right character himself. He must be governed, in all 
that he does, by high and honorable principles of action. He must be really beney- 
olent and kind. He must take an honest interest in his pupils—not merely in their 
studies and general characters, but in all their childish thoughts and feelings, in the 
difficulties they encounter, in their temptations and trials, in their sports, in their 
* contentions, in their troubles—in everything, in fact, that affects them. He must, 
in a word, feel a strong interest and sympathy for them, in the thousand difficulties 
and discouragements they must encounter, in slowly finding their way, with all their 
ignorance and inexperience, to their place in the complicated and bewildering maze 
of human life. 
A teacher who takes this sort of interest in his pupils will understand them and 
sympathize with them, in a way which will at once command their kind regard, and 
give him a powerful, and, in the view of others, a very mysterious ascendancy over 
their minds. They feel as if he was upon their side, taking their part, as it were, 
against the difficulties, and dangers, and troubles, which surround them. Thus he 
becomes one of them—a sharer in their enjoyments—a partaker of their feelings. 
, They come to him with confidence. He plans their amusements; he joins them in 
conyersation; he settles their disputes. They see on what principles he acts, and 
they catch, themselves, the same mode of action, from him, by a kind of sympathy. 
They imbibe his sentiments insensibly and spontaneously, not because he enunciates 
them, or proves them in lectures, but because he exhibits them in living reality in 
his conversation and conduct. This sort of sympathetic action between heart and 
heart has far greater influence, among all mankind, than formal teachings and exhor- 
tations. It is the life and spirit of virtue, in contradistinction from the letter and 
the forms = 
If all the children of this land were under the charge of such teachers, for six 
hours in the day, and ten months in the year, and were to continue under these 
influences for the usual period of instruction in schools, I do not see why the result 
_ would not be that, in two generations, substantially the whole population would be
-P-A-G-E-23

  trained up to virtue, to habits of integrity, fidelity in duty, justice, temperance, and 
mutual good will. It seems to me that this effect would take place in all cases, 
except where extremely unfavorable influences out of school should counteract it, 
- which I think would hardly be the case, except in some districts in the more populous 
cities. 
Iam, very respectfully, yours, 
Jacos ABBorr. 
Letter from F. A. Adams, esq. 
Hon. Horace Many, 
Dear-Gim: = * * 
I do not hesitate to express the conyiction that there is no agency which society 
can exert, through the Government, capable of exerting so great a moral influence for 
the rising generation as the steady training of the young in the best schools. * * * 
In reply to the specific inquiry in your circular, What proportion of our youth 
would probably, under the advantages of schooling presupposed in the circular, fail 
of fulfilling honorably their social and moral obligations in society? I would say that 
in the course of my experience for ten years in teaching between three hundred and 
four hundred children, mostly boys, I have been acquainted with not more than two 
pupils in regard to whom I should not feel a cheerful and strong confidence in the 
success of the proposed experiment. In regard to these two cases I should not de- 
spair, but should haye a strong preponderance of fear that under the best influences, 
such as you have supposed, they would still remain wedded to low and mischievous 
habits. From their peculiar temperament there was much reason to suppose that a 
life of steady and hard labor would do for them’ much, in a moral point of view, 
which the influences of school could not accomplish. 
The class of youth I have had under my care would in some respects afford a better 
than average chance for the success of the experiment, as they in all cases have been 
exempt from the evils of poverty. In other respects, however, this exemption was 
counterbalanced by habits of self-indulgence, which could not haye existed had the 
pecuniary means been wanting. 
T remain, dear sir, with sincere respect and esteem, yours, 
F. A. Apams.

Letter from E. A. Andrews, esq. 
New Brrrary, Conn., December 8, 1847. 
Hon. Horace Many, 
Dean Sep to * 
In reply to your first and second questions, permit me simply to remark that I 
have been connected with the department of education, either as pupil or as teacher, 
for more than fifty years. I have instructed both in the country and in cities; in 
the former I haye, for the most part, had the charge of only a few select pupils; in 
the latter, for about twenty years, I was connected with large institutions of instruc- 
tion. I have no means of determining with any tolerable approach to accuracy the 
whole number of my pupils, nor the proportion of each sex. * * * 
I do not hesitate to express my conviction that such an education as your question 
supposes, continued for so longa period as twelve years, and including all the chil- 
dren of the community, would remove a very large portion of the evils with which 
society is now burdened. I need not say that I would be far from attributing so 
important results to any system of merely intellectual training, or even to the most 
perfect combination of intellectual, physical, and moral discipline, to the exclusion 
of that which is strictly religious. Such a qualification of my meaning might have 
been necessary, on account of the limited sense in which the word education is often 
used, had not the necessity been removed by the express terms of the conditions 
annexed to the questions in your circular. 
It may indeed be feared that society is not yet fully prepared to put forth the 
effort necessary to accomplish so desirable a result; but I can not believe that the 
time-is very remote when its attainment will be considered an object of paramount 
importance. It can not be that the millions of intelligent men found in this and in 
other Christian countries can much longer permit their feelings to be enlisted, and the 
resources of the communities to which they belong to be employed, in pro- 
moting objects of far inferior value; while the advantages of a good system of gen- 
eral education are, in so great a degree, overlooked. If, as I fully believe, it is in 
the power of the people of any State, by means so simple as your question supposes, 
 
-P-A-G-E-24
    
6 1264 EDUCATION REPGRT, 1898-99. 
and so completely in their own power as these obviously are, so to change the whole 
face of society in a single generation that scarcely 1 or 2 per cent of really incorrigi- 
ble members shall be found in it, it can not be that so great a good will continue to 
be neglected, and the means for its attainment unemployed. 
In forming our estimate of the probability of so important a result as I have sup- 
posed, it must not be forgotten, that, simple as are the means now proposed for its 
attainment, they have never been employed, so far asI know, in any extended com- 
munity whose experience is on record. In Scotland, and of late in Prussia, a con- 
siderable approximation has been made toward reaching the supposed conditions, 
and with benefits, it is believed, fully corresponding with the degree of perfection of 
their respective systems. The common schools of New England, which have done 
so much to elevate her character, have still fallen immeasurably short of the condi- 
tions supposed. With all their acknowledged defects, however, the instances, I 
believe, are few in which those who have been trained in them, from childhood to 
the close of the period usually allotted to education in these schools, have after- 
wards, on mingling with the world, proven to be incorrigibly vicious, a burden 
rather than a benefit to society. The records of our criminal courts and the doors 
of our penitentiaries, have seldom been opened to those who, in childhood, had 
been in regular daily attendance, for ten or twelve years, upon the exercises of our 
common schools, however imperfect these schools may have been in their organiza- 
tion, and notwithstanding all the evil influences of uneducated associates to which 
the pupils have been exposed when out of school. The cell of the convict has, on 
the contrary, been almost uniformly occupied by those who have enjoyed few of the 
benefits of our common schools; and even the tenants of our poorhouses, it is 
believed, have, in most instances, belonged to the same unfortunate class. * * *

Judging from what I have seen and do know, if the conditions you have mentioned 
were strictly complied with, if the attendance of the scholars could be as universal, 
constant, and long-continued as you have stated, if the teachers were men of those 
high intellectual and moral qualities, apt to teach, and devoted to their work, and 
favored with that blessing which the word and providence of God teach us always 
to expect on our honest, earnest, and well-directed efforts in so good a cause, on 
these conditions, and under these circumstances, I do not hesitate to express the 
opinion that the failures need not be, would not be, one per cent. Else, what is the 
meaning of that explicit declaration of the Bible, ‘‘Train up a child in the way he 
should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it?”’ 
Iam aware that the opinion I have expressed above may by some be considered 
extravagant. But I have not formed or expressed it without deliberation. During 
all my experience as a teacher, I have never known the scholar whom, if brought 
within the reach of these salutary and auspicious influences for the length of time 
named, I should now be willing to believe, or dare to pronounce, utterly hopeless 
and irreclaimable. I do not mean to say that I neyer failed. But I do say that, in - 
some of the most difficult and desperate cases I have ever met with, as a teacher, 
the result of direct, special, and perserving effort was such as to create the conviction 
that, with more zeal, patience and perseverance, and especially with the favoring 
influences above alluded to, success would have been certain and complete. And 
this conviction became more settled and strong the longer I continued to teach. 
The power of atruly enlightened and Christian system of common-school education 
is but little understood and appreciated. When parents shall begin to feel, as they 
ought, its importance, when the community generally shall be willing to make the 
necessary efforts and sacrifices, and when teachers of the requisite literary qualifica- 
tions and of high moral aims shall enter upon the work with a martyr’s zeal, con- 
scious that every day they are making deathless impressions upon immortal minds, 
then we shall see, as I believe, results which will greatly surpass the highest expecta- 
tions of the most ardent and enthusiastic advocates of popular education.

  EDUCATION AND CRIME. 1265 
Letter from Miss Catherine E. Beecher. 
BratrLesoro, August 20, 1847. 
Hon. Horace Mann. 
Duar Sr: In reference to the questions you pOEODOe; I would reply that I have 
been engaged directly and personally as a teacher about fifteen years in Hartford, 
Conn., and Cincinnati, Ohio. I have had a few classes of quite young children under 
my care, for the purpose of making some practical educational experiments; but 
most of my pupils in age have ranged from twelve to twenty. I have had pupils 
from every State in the Union, and, though I haye no precise records, I think the 
number can not be less than a thousand. 
I have ever considered intellectual culture as subordinate to the main end of edu- 
cation, which is the formation of that character which Jesus Christ teaches to be 
indispensable to the eternal well-being of our race. Excepting the few classes of 
young children before named, my efforts have been directed to measures for reform- 
ing bad and supplying good habits and principles in minds already more or less 
developed by education; and this I consider a much more difficult work than the 
right training of minds as yet uninjured by pernicious influences. 
In reference to the work of reforming miseducated minds, I have found that the 
noblest constructed minds when greatly mismanaged are most liable to become the 
worst, while at the same time they most readily yield to the reformatory measure, so 
that, as ageneral rule, with exceptions, of course, TeHould expect to do the most good 
to the worst class of pupils, and in some cases to make finer characters from this class 
than from those who, possessing less excitable temperaments, have not fallen so far. 
I would also remark that in the results I should anticipate, in the case to be sup- 
posed hereafter, my chief hope of success would rest on the proper application of 
those truthsand motives which distinguish the teachings of Jesus Christ from what is 
called ‘‘natural religion,” and by modesof presentation more simple and practical than 
I haye ever seen fully adopted, or than I ever adopted myself when a practical teacher. 
With these preliminaries, which I hope will be carefully pondered and borne in 
mind as indispensable, I will now suppose that it could be so arranged that in a given 
place, containing from ten to fifteen thousand inhabitants, in any part of our. country 
where I ever resided, all the children at the’age of four should is placed six hours 
a day for twelve years under the care of teachers having the same views that I have, 
and having received that course of training for their office that any State in this 
Union can secure to the teachers of its children. Let it be so arranged that all these 
children shall remain till sixteen under these teachers, and also that they shall spend 
their lives in this city, and I have no hesitation in saying I do not believe that one, 
no, not a single one, would fail of proving a respectable and prosperous member of 
society; nay, more, I believe every one would at the close of life find admission into 
the world of endless peace and love. I say this solemnly, deliberately, and with the 
full belief that I am upheld by such imperfect experimental trials as I have made or 
seen made by others; but more than this, that I am sustained by the authority of 
Heaven, which sets forth this grand palladium of education, ‘Train up a child in 
the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it.” 
This sacred maxim surely represents the divine imprimatur to the doctrine that all 
children can be trained up in the way they should go, and that when so trained they 
will not depart from it. Nor does it imply that education alone will secure eternal 
life without supernatural assistance, but it points to the true method of securing this 
indispensable aid. 
In this view of the case I can command no language strong enough to express my 
infinite longings that my countrymen who as legislators have the control of the 
institutions, the laws, and the wealth of our physically prosperous nation should 
be brought to see that they now have in their hands the power of securing to every 
child in the coming generation a life of virtue and usefulness here and an eter- 
nity of perfected bliss hereafter. How then can I express or imagine the awful 
responsibility which rests upon them, and which hereafter they must bear before. 
the great Judge of nations, if they suffer the present state of things to go on, bearing 
as it does thousands and hundreds of thousands of helpless children in our country 
to hopeless and irretrievable ruin. 
Respectfully, yours, ©. E. Beecrer. 
P. S.—All I anticipate, as stated in my communication, may come to pass without 
any departure from your statutory regulations in regard to religious instruction, as 
I understand these statutes, and as I suppose them to be understood by the great 
body of those who formed them, and of those who are bound by them. ean

The above answers are not choice specimens selected from among many; they are 
all I have received; and every person to whom the circular was sent was pleased to 
answer it. From conversations, held at different times, with many other teachers 
I believe the amount of testimony might have been very much increased, though no 
confirmation can be needed of its authority. The witnesses here introduced cer- 
tainly possess all the requisites to entitle them to implicit credence. Their character 
for honor and veracity repels the idea of distrust. Years of experience in different 
places and the training of children in great numbers qualify them in point of 
knowledge to speak with authority, and they are exempt from any imaginable bias 
to warp or to color the truth. 
From time immemorial it has been customary for Parliaments and other legisla- 
tive bodies to commit important practical subjects to committees, and through 
their instrumentality to obtain the testimony of learned and skilled men on the 
matter of inquiry. Sometimes witnesses are heard at the bar of the House—that is, 
before the legislative body by whom the inquiry was instituted. Now I haye 
desired, in the present case, to introduce testimony of such credibility and cogency 
that no legislative committee could report against it, and no legislative body could 
act against it, without incurring an historic odium, either for want of intelligence or 
want of integrity. 
So, too, by the rules of ‘‘common law,”’ all questions of fact are decided by the 
intervention of a jury. In ancient times, when the character of juries was very 
different from what it now is, they sometimes gave a corrupt verdict; that is, a 
verdict so contradictory to evidence as to be of itself proof that they had discarded 
the testimony adduced and been governed by.some dishonest motive in their own 
breasts. A jury convicted of this offense was said to be “‘attainted.’”” Its members 
were punished by a fine and rendered infamous ever after. It was my intention, in 
the present case, to introduce evidence of such authority and directness as if sub: 
mitted toa jury and rejected by them would, under the ancient law referred to, 
subject them to the penalties of an ‘‘attaint.’’ 
There is one quality or characteristic common to all the witnesses whose testimony 
is above introduced which, as it seems to me, I am not only justified in stating, but 
which it would be inexcusable to withhold. All of them, without exception, are 
well-known believers in a theological creed one of whose fundamental articles is the 
depravity of the natural heart. They hold, in a literal sense and with regard to all 
mankind, that the innate affections or dispositions of the soul are ‘‘not subject to 
the law of God, neither indeed can be,’’ until another influence, emanating from the 
Godhead, and equal in itself to an act of creation, shall have renewed them. With 
this private belief of the witnesses, of course, neither the board of education nor 
any man or body of men have aught to do, unless, indeed, it be to affirm their 
right to hold it, in common with every other man’s right either to agree with them 
or to dissent from them. But as bearing upon the point under consideration the fact 
is most important; it adds great cogency to their testimony, and invests it, as it were, 
with a compulsory power. For, if those who believe that the human heart is by 
nature alienated from God, that its innate relation tothe Holy One is that of natural 
repulsion and not of natural attraction, nor even of neutrality; if they, from their 
own experience in the education of youth, believe that our common-school system, 
under certain practicable modifications, can rear up a generation of men who will 
practice toward their fellow-men whatsoever things are true, honest, just, pure, 
lovely, and of good report; then, surely, a rational community can need no addi- 
tional evidence or motive to impel it to the work of reform, And all those, if such 
there are, who believe that moral evil comes from the abuse or misuse of powers in 
themselves good, and not from any inborn and original predilection for wrong, may 
well take courage, and may tender their heartiest cooperation in furthering an enter- 
prise which, even under fundamental postulates the most adverse, promises results
-P-A-G-E-27
  EDUCATION AND CRIME. 1267 
‘so glorious. Ii they who believe that there is a principle of evil in the human soul, 
lying back of consciousness incorporated as an original element into its constitution, 
beginning to be when the spirit itself began to be, and growing with it through all 
the primordial stages of its growth, which, indeed, belongs to the antenatal period of 
every descendant of Adam, as much as spottedness belongs to an unborn leopard 
before it has a skin, or venom to an unhatched cockatrice before it has a sting; if 
those who believe this do nevertheless believe that our common-school system, with 
certain practicable modifications, can send out redeeming and transforming influences 
which shall expel ninety-nine hundredths of all the vices and crimes under which 
society now mourns and agonizes, then those who dissent from the belief that the 
natural heart is thus organically intractable and perverse, will be all the more ready 
to proclaim the ameliorating power of education, and will all the more earnestly 
labor for its diffusion. And the crowning beauty of the whole is that Christian men 
of every faith may cordially unite in carrying forward the work of reform, however 
various may be their opinions as to the cause which has made that work necessary; 
just as all good citizens may unite in extinguishing a conflagration, though there may 
be a hundred conflicting opinions as to the means or the men that kindled it. In 
short, it may be difficult to determine which class will act under the more conscience- 
moving motives—those who hold to a total depravity or corruption of the human 
heart, but still believe it can be emancipated from worldly vices and crimes by such 
instrumentalities as we can readily command; or those who hold that heart to be 
naturally capable of good as well as evil, and who therefore believe, not only that a 
still larger proportion of the race can be rescued from the dominion of wrong doing, 
put that a consummation so glorious can be reached at a still earlier period and with 
a less expenditure of effort. 
But this divine result of staying the desolating torrent of practical iniquity by 
drying up its fountain head in the bosoms of the young, is promised only on the 
antecedence or performance of certain prescribed conditions. These conditions are 
the three following: 
1. That the public schools shall be conducted on the cardinal principles of the 
present New England system; 
2. That they shall all be taught, for a period of ten months in each year, by per- 
sons of high intellectual and moral qualifications—or, in other words, that all the 
teachers shall be equal in capacity and in character to those whom we now call first- 
class or first-rate teachers; and 
3. That all the children in the Commonwealth shall attend school regularly—that 
is, for the ten months each year during which they are kept—from the age of 4 to 
that of 16 years. 
As it is on the performance of these conditions that the renovation of society is 
predicated, it is, of course, necessary to show that they are practicable conditions. 
I therefore proceed to consider and, as I trust, to establish their practicability. 
I. The first condition—namely, that the schools shall be conducted on the cardinal 
principles of the New England system—is already satisfied. The Massachusetts 
school system represents favorably the systems of all the New England States. Not 
one of them has an element of prosperity or of permanence, of security against decay 
within, or the inyasion of its rights from without, which ours does not possess. Our 
Jaw requires that a school shall be sustained in every town in the State—even the 
smallest and the poorest not being excepted—and that this school shall be as open and 
free to all the children as the light of day or the air of heaven. No child is met on 
the threshold of the schoolhouse door to be asked for money, or whether his parents 
are native or foreign, whether or not they pay a tax, or what is their faith. The 
schoolhouse is common property. All about it are inclosures and hedges, indicating 
private ownership and forbidding intrusion; but here is a spot which even rapacity 
dares not lay its finger upon. The most avaricious would as soon thirk of monopo-  
-P-A-G-E-28
    
  1268 | EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
lizing the summer cloud, as it comes floating up from the west to shed its treasures 
upon the thirsty earth, as of monopolizing these fountains of knowledge. Public 
opinion—that sovereign in representative governments—is in harmony with the law. 
Not infrequently there is some private opposition, and occasionally it avows itself 
and assumes an attitude of hostility; but perseverance on the part of the friends of 
progress always subdues it, and the success of their measures eventually shames it 
out of existence. 
The law requires all public schools to be kept by a teacher whose literary and 
moral qualifications have been examined and approved by a committee chosen for 
the purpose by the people themselves. Not less than the six following branches of 
knowledge are to be taught in every town; namely, orthography, reading, writing, 
English grammar, geography, and arithmetic. The teaching of ‘‘good behavior,’’ 
which includes all the courtesies of life, and all the minor morals, is also expressly 
enjoined. These peremptory requisitions are the minimum, but not the maximum. 
Any town may enlarge the course of studies to be pursued in its schools as much as 
it may choose, even to the preparation of young men for the university, or for any 
branch of educated labor. It may also bestow an equivalent education upon the 
other sex. The law also contains a further provision (subject, however, to be set 
aside by the express vote of a district or town), that in every school of more than 
fiity scholars in regular attendance an assistant teacher shall be employed. Although 
there is no statutory provision to this effect in any other of the New England States, 
yet the good sense of the community everywhere advocates this rule. 
Nor are the needs of the intellect alone provided for. In prescribing the education 
to be given to the moral nature the law grows more earnest and impressive. Its 
beautiful and deep-toned language is, ‘‘It shall be the duty of the president, pro- 
fessors, and tutors of the university at Cambridge, and of the several colleges, and of 
all preceptors and teachers of academies, and all other instructors of youth to exert 
their best endeavors to impress on the minds of children and youth committed to 
their care and instruction the principles of piety, justice, and a sacred regard to truth, 
love to their country, humanity and universal benevolence, sobriety, industry and 
frugality, chastity, moderation and temperance, and those other virtues which are 
the ornament of human society and the basis upon which a republican constitution 
is founded, and it shall be the duty of such instructors to endeavor to lead their 
pupils, as their ages and capacities will permit, into a clear understanding of the tend- 
ency of the above-mentioned virtues to preserve and perfect a republican constitu- 
tion and secure the blessings of liberty, as well as to promote their future happiness, 
and also to point out to them the eyil tendency of the opposite vices.’”’? But lest any 
individual or body of individuals, forgetful of the divine precept to do unto others as 
they would be done unto, should seize upon this statutory injunction, or upon some 
part of it, as a pretext for turning the schools into proselytizing institutions, the law 
rears a barrier against all sectarian encroachments. That which is ‘‘calculated to 
favor the tenets of any particular sect of Christians’’ is excluded from the schools. 
The use of the Bible in schools is*not expressly enjoined by the law, but both its 
letter and its spirit are in consonance with that use, and, as a matter of fact, I sup- 
pose there is not, at the present time, a single town in the Commonwealth in whose 
schools it is not read. Whoever, therefore, believes in the Sacred Scriptures has his 
belief, in form and in spirit, in the schools, and his children read and hear the words 
themselves which contain it. The administration of this law is intrusted to the local 
authorities in the respective towns. By introducing the Bible they introduce what 
all its believers hold to be the rule of faith and practice, and although, by excluding 
theological systems of human origin, they may exclude a peculiarity which one 
denomination believes to be true, they do but exclude what other denominations 
believe to be erroneous. Such is the present policy of our law for including what all
-P-A-G-E-29
EDUCATION AND CRIME. 1269 
Christians hold to be right, and for excluding what all, excepting some one party, 
hold to be wrong. 
If it be the tendency of all parties and sects to fasten the mind upon what is pecu- 
liar to each and to withdraw it from what is common to all, these provisions of the 
Jaw counterwork that tendency. They turn the mind toward that which produces 
harmony, while they withdraw it from sources of discord, and thus through the 
medium of our schools that song which ushered in the Christian era, ‘‘Peace on earth 
and good will to men,” may be taken up and continued through the ages. 
The first condition, then, not only may be, but actually is, complied with, in the 
the school system of Massachusetts as now established and administered. 
II. The second condition requires that all our schools shall be kept, for ten months 
in each year, by persons of high intellectual and moral qualifications—by persons 
equal in capacity and in character to those whom we now call first-class or first-rate 
teachers. 
This condition supposes two things which, as yet, we are very far from having 
attained. The question is, are they attainable? 
In regard to teachers, it supposes such an improvement as shall advance all those 
who are now behind what we call the front rank until they shall come upon a line 
with it. Of course if this be done, some will be found in advance of this line, for it 
never can happen, with regard to all the members of any profession, that they will 
stand precisely abreast. It supposes, also, that all our schools shall be kept for ten 
months each year. 
The questions, then, for consideration under this head, are two, namely: 
1. Is there, in the community at large, sufficient natural endowment or capacity 
from which, by appropriate training and cultivation, the requisite number of teach- 
ers possessing the supposed qualifications can be prepared? And 
2. Can the towns and the State, separately or as copartners, bear the expense of 
maintaining the required class of teachers for the required length of time? 
Is not the first question answered in the affirmative by observation and experience? 
For the last two generations, with exceptions comparatively few, all the eminent 
men of our State, whether men of letters, physicians, lawyers, clergymen, legislators, 
or judges, have taught school, more or less, during the early part of their lives, 
Now, it is no disparagement to say, respecting those who constitute at present our 
best class of teachers, that they are not superior in endowments or natural capacity, 
in industry or in versatility of genius to a vast number of their predecessors who, 
haying labored for a limited period in this field, at length abandoned it in quest of 
some other occupation truly known to be more lucrative and falsely supposed to be 
more honorable. It is no unauthorized assumption, then, to say that great numbers 
of those who left the employment of school keeping for something deemed to be more 
eligible would, had they continued in it, have won the honor of standing in the fore- 
most rank of this noble profession. 
In the second place, to prove that there is no lack of natural talent in existence 
from which to form the supposed class of teachers, I may refer to the general history 
and experience of mankind in all other departments of human effort. No new call- 
ing has ever reached such an elevation as to insure honor and emolument to its 
professors which has not, without delay, attracted to itself an adequate number of 
followers. Witness the intrinsically odious profession of arms—a profession so odi- 
ous that those haye been held worthy of especial reward who resisted the natural 
love of ease and instincts of self-preservation to encounter its hardships and perils. 
So, also, has it been in regard to commerce and the useful arts; and in those truly 
dignified and honorable professions—the legal and clerical—where mind is the object 
to be acted upon, as well as the agent to act, the supply has generally exceeded the 
demand. Now, could the business of education take its stand in public estimation 
 
-P-A-G-E-30
  1270 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
by the side of the most honorable and lucrative callings in life, we are authorized by 
all the experience of mankind to conclude that it would soon cluster around itself an 
amount of talent, erudition, and genius at least equal to what has ever adorned any 
other ayocation among civilized men. 
But, independently of personal knowledge and of historic experience, may not a 
conclusive argument in support of the general position be drawn from the energy and 
versatility with which, as we all know, Nature has gifted the minds of her children? 
In the variety and strength of the capacities belonging to the race there must be the 
means or instruments by which Providence can accomplish every good work. Some- 
where, in each generation, the powers exist by which the generation that is to suc- 
ceed it may be advanced another stage along the radiant pathway of improyement. 
But in the whole of the past history of the world no generation has yet existed 
whose faculties have not, to a very great extent, lain dormant, to say nothing of the 
perversion of those which have been developed. But our free institutions cherish 
growth. The future with us is not to be measured by the past. The mind of the 
masses, which for somany ages had been crippled, and fettered after it was crippled, 
is here unbound. Under the stimulus applied to native vigor, talent and genius 
start up as naturally as vegetation in the spring. The desire of bettering one’s con- 
dition springs from a universal instinct in the human mind. With us every man 
sees that the gratification of this desire is within his reach. Including the lifetime 
of a single generation—that is, within the last forty or fifty years—there is not a 
school district in Massachusetts, however obscure, which has shown any interest 
in the character of its schools, that has not sent out one or more men who have 
become conspicuous in some of the honorable positions of society. They are found 
throughout the Union—wherever enterprise or talent is rewarded. Those districts 
and, still more, those towns, where common schools have been an object of special 
regard, have sent forth many such men. While visiting different parts of the State, 
for the last ten years, facts in sufficient numbers to make a most interesting and 
instructive book have come to my knowledge, showing that those districts and towns, 
where special pains have been exerted and special liberality bestowed in behalf of 
common schools, haye supplied a proportion of all the distinguished men of the 
vicinity corresponding with the superior excellence of the early education afforded 
them. So, on the other hand, neglectful towns and districts have been compara- 
tively barren of eminent men. The great ears of corn will not grow on sand hills. 
Great men will not spring up in an atmosphere void of intellectual nutrition. Nature 
observes a law in this respect in regard to her spiritual as well as her physical pro- 
ductions. Now, although something has been done in Massachusetts for the culture 
and expansion of the common mind, yet indefinitely more may be done. Even were 
it admitted, therefore, that the State had not been able in the past times to supply 
the requisite number of teachers of the highest grade, it would by no means follow 
that she could not do so in the future. 
The intrinsically noble profession of teaching has, most unfortunately, been sur- 
rounded by an atmosphere of repulsion rather than of attraction. Young men of 
talent are generally determined by two things in selecting an employment for life. 
The first of these is the natural tendency of the mind—its predisposition toward 
one pursuit rather than toward another. In this way nature often predetermines 
what a man shall do, and, to make her purpose inevitable, she kneads it, as it were, 
into the stamina of his existence. She does not content herself with standing before 
his will, soliciting or tempting him to.a particular course, but she stands behind the 
will, guiding and propelling it, so that, from birth, he seems to be projected toward 
his object, like a well-aimed arrow to its mark. Those in whom the love of beau- 
tiful forms, colors, and proportions predominate are naturally won to the cultivation 
of the fine arts or to some branch of the useful arts most congenial to the fine. Those 
who haye a great fondness for botany and chemistry, and to whom physiological
-P-A-G-E-31
  
  EDUCATION AND CRIME. 1271 
inquiries are especially grateful, become physicians. Persons enamored of forensic 
contests, roused by their excitements and panting for the eclat which their victories 
confer, betake themselves to the study of the law and becomeadvocates. The clerical 
profession is composed of men whose minds are deeply imbued and penetrated with 
the religious sentiment, and who ponder. profoundly and devoutly upon the solemn 
concerns of an hereafter.' This constitutional or moral affinity for one sphere of 
employment rather than for another predetermines many minds in choosing the 
object of their pursuit for life. It is like the elective attractions of the chemist, 
existing beforehand, and only awaiting the contiguity of the related substances to 
make their secret affinities manifest. 
But this natural tendency is often subjected to a disturbing or modifying force; and 
it yields to this force the more readily as it is itself less intense and dominant. All 
minds have a desire, more or less energetic, for pleasure, for wealth, for honor, or for 
some of that assemblage of rewards which obtains such willing allegiance from man- 
kind. Hence the internal, inborn impulse is often diverted from the specific object 
to which it naturally points, and is lured away to another object, which, from some 
collateral or adventitious reason, promises a readier gratification. 
There is also a class of minds of vigorous and varied capacities which stands nearly 
balanced between different pursuits, and which, therefore, may be turned, by slight 
circumstances, in any one of many directions. They are like fountains of water 
rising on a table-land, whose channels may be so cut as to cover either of its slopes 
with fertility. 
Now, the qualities which predispose their possessor to become the companion, guide, 
and teacher of children are good sense, lively religious sensibilities, practical, unaf- 
fected benevolence, a genuine sympathy with the young, and that sunny, genial tem- 
perament which always sees its own cheerfulness reflected from the ever-open mirror 
of achild’s face. The slightest exercise of good sense makes it apparent that any one 
year of childhood will exert a more decisive control over future destiny than any ten 
years afterwards. The religious and benevolent elements seize instinctively upon the 
promise made to those who train up children in the way they should go. The love 
of children casts a pleasing illusion over the mind, in regard to everything they do— 
if, indeed, it be an illusion, and not a truth above the reach of the intellect—eleva- 
ting their puerile sports into dignity, hailing each step in their progress as though it 
were some grand discovery in science, and grieving over their youthful wanderings 
or backslidings with as deep a sorrow as is felt for the turpitude of a full-grown man, 
or for the heaven-defying sins of a nation. So that genial, joyous, ever-smiling tem- 
perament, which sees only rainbows where others see clouds, and which is delighted 
by the reflection of itself when coming from one child’s face, will never tire of its 
labors when the same charming image perpetually comes back from the multiplying 
glasses of group after group of happy children—eyer varying, but always beautiful. 
Now, I think we haye abundant reason to believe that a sufficient number of per- 
sons, bearing from the hand of nature this distinctive image and superscription of a 
school-teacher, are born into the world with every generation. - But the misfortune 
is that when they arrive at years of discretion, and begin to survey the various fields 
of labor that lie open before them, they find that the noblest of them all, and the one, 
too, for which they have the greatest natural predilection, is neither honored by dis- 
tinction nor rewarded by emolument. They see that if they enter it many of their 
colleagues and associates will be persons with whom they have no congeniality of 
feeling, and who occupy a far less elevated position in the social scale than that to 
which their own aspirations point. If they go through the whole country and ques- 
tion every man, they can not find a single public-school teacher who has acquired 
  
1 This general remark must be taken with the exception of a few of the yery worst men which any 
age ever produces. These become members of the clerical profession because, under the mask of its 
sanctity, they hope to practice their iniquities with impunity,

  1272 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
wealth by the longest and the most devoted life of labor. They can not find one who 
has been promoted to the presidency of a college, or to a professorship in it; nor one 
who has been elected or appointed to fill any distinguished civil station. Hence, in 
most cases, the adventitious circumstances which surround the object of their prefer- 
ence repel them fromit. Or, if they enter the profession, it is only for a brief period, 
and for some collateral purpose; and when their temporary end is gained they sink 
it still lower by their avowed or well-understood reasons for abandoning it. Such is 
the literal history of hundreds and of thousands who have shone or are now shining 
in other walks of life, but who would have shone with beams far more creative of 
human happiness had they not been struck from the sphere for which nature 
preadapted them. * 
Look at the average rate of wages paid to teachers in some of the pattern States of 
the Union. In Maine it is $15.40 per month to males and $4.80 to females. In New 
Hampshire it is $13.50 per month to males and $5.65 to females. In Vermont it is 
$12 per month to males and $4.75 to females. In Connecticut it is $16 per month to 
males and $6.50 to females. In New York it is $14.96 per month to males and $6.69 
to females. In Pennsylvania it is $17.02 per month to males and $10.09 to females. 
In Ohio it is $15.42 per month to males and $8.73 to females. In Indiana it is $12 
per month to males and $6 to females. In Michiganit is $12.71 per month to males 
and $5.36 to females. Even in Massachusetts it is only $24.51 per month to males 
and $8.07 to females. All this is exclusive of board; but let it be compared with what 
is paid to cashiers of banks, to secretaries of insurance companies, to engineers upon. 
railroads, to superintendents in factories, to custom-house officers, navy agents, ete., 
and it will then be seen what pecuniary temptations there are on every side, drawing 
enterprising and talented young men from the ranks of the teachers’ profession. 
Nor does the social estimation accorded to teachers much surpass the pecuniary 
value set upon their services. The nature of their calling debars them almost uni- 
versally from political honors, which throughout our whole country have a factitious 
value so much above their real worth. Without entire faithlessness to their trust 
they can not engage in trade or commercial speculations. Modes of education have 
heretofore been so imperfect that I do not know a single instance where a teacher 
has been transferred from his school to any of those departments of educated labor 
in which such liberal salaries are now given. And thus it is that the profession at 
large, while they enjoy but a measured degree of public respect, seem shut out from 
all the paths that lead to fortune or to fame. No worldly prize is held up before 
them; and, in the present condition of mankind, how few there are who will work 
exclusively for the immortal reward. It supposes the possession only of very low 
faculties to derive pleasure from singing the praises of a martyr; but, to be the 
martyr oneself requires very high ones. 
Hence it is, as was before said, that when the aspiring and highly endowed youth of 
our country arrive at years of discretion, and begin to survey the varied employments 
which lie spread out before them, they find that the noblest of them all presents the 
fewest external attractions. Those whose natural or acquired ambition seeks for 
wealth go into trade. The mechanical genius applies himself to the useful arts. 
The politically ambitious connect themselves with some one of those classes from 
which public officers are usually selected. Medicine attracts those who have the 
peculiar combination of tastes congenial to it. Those who ponder most upon the 
ways of God to men minister in sacred things. Who, then, are left to fill the most 
important position known to social life? A few remain whose natural tendencies in 
this direction are too vehement to be resisted or diverted; a somewhat larger num- 
ber, who have no strong predilection for one sphere of exertion rather than for 
another, and to whom, under the circumstances peculiar to each, school keeping is 
as eligible as any other employment. But many, very many, the great majority,

engage in it not for its own sake, but only to make it subservient to some ulterior 
object, or (with humiliation be is said) perhaps only to escape from manual labor. 
The profession of school keeping, then, as a profession, has never had an equal 
chance with its competitors. On the one hand, it has been resorted to by great num- 
bers whose only object was to make a little money out of it and then abandon it; 
and, on the other, its true disciples, those who might have been and should have 
been its leaders and priesthood, have been lured and seduced away from it by all the 
more splendid prizes of life. 
Even though, therefore, the profession of school keeping has not been crowded 
by learned and able men, devoting their energies and their lives to its beneficent 
labors, this fact wholly fails to prove that nature does not produce, with eaclr gen- 
eration, a sufficient number of fit persons, who, under an equitable distribution or 
apportionment of honors and rewards for meritorious services, would be found 
preadapted for school keeping in the same way that Newton was for mathematics, 
or Pope for poetry, or Franklin for the infallibility of his common sense. Indeed, 
the proportion of good teachers whom we now have, notwithstanding all their dis- 
couragements against entering and their seducements for leaving the profession, 
seem demonstrative of the contrary. 
Thus far the argument has proceeded upon the basis that the required number of 
teachers, possessing the high grade of qualifications supposed, must equal the pres- 
ent number, such as these are. But it is almost too obyious to need mentioning 
that if the qualifications of teachers were to be so greatly enhanced and the term of 
the schools so materially lengthened, as is proposed, teaching would then really 
become a profession, and the same teachers would keep school through the year. 
Instead, therefore, of changing from male teachers in the winter to females in the 
summer, back again to males in the winter, and so on, alternately—the children of 
each school suffering under a new stepfather or a new stepmother each half year— 
they would enjoy the vastly improved system of continuous training under the same 
hands. This would diminish by almost one-half the required number of teachers 
for our schools; the poorer half would be discarded, the better half retained. Surely, 
under these circumstances, if a sufficient number of the very highest class of teacherS 
could not be found, it would not be owing to any parsimony of nature in withhold- 
ing the endowments, but to our unpardonable niggardliness in not cultivating and 
employing them. 
Feeling now authorized to assume that the first proposition has been satisfactorily 
established, it only remains to be considered, under this head, whether the commu- 
nity at large—the towns separately, or the towns and the State by joint contribu- 
tions—can afford to make such compensation as shall attract to this field of labor the 
high order of teachers supposed, and shall requite them generously for their services. 
To induce persons of the highest order of talent to become teachers, and to deter 
good teachers from abandoning the profession, its emoluments must bear some close 
analogy to those which the same persons could command in other employments. 
The case, too, as presented in the circular, and upon which the evidence has been 
obtained, supposes the schools to continue for ten months in each year. Although 
in many large towns the schools are now kept more than this portion of the year, yet 
their average length for the whole State is but eight months. The increased expense, 
then, both of the longer term and of the more liberal compensation, must be pro- 
vided for. Can the community sustain this expense? 
Let us suppose for a moment that 99 per cent of our whole community should be 
temperate, honest, industrious, frugal people—conscientious in feeling and exemplary 
in conduct—is it not certain that two grand pecuniary consequences would immedi- 
ately follow, namely, a vast gain in productive power and a vast saving in the crim- 
inal destruction and loss of property? Either of these sources of gain would more
-P-A-G-E-34
    1274 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
than defray the increased expenses of the system, which, according to the evidence I 
haye obtained, would insure both. The current expenses last year for the education 
of all the children in the State between the ages of 4 and 16 was $3.14 on an average 
for each one. Look into the police courts of our cities in the morning—and espe- 
cially on Monday morning—when the ghastly array of drunkards is marched in for 
trial. A case may not occupy ten minutes, and yet the fine, costs, and expenses would 
educate two children for a year in our public schools at the present rate, or one child 
at double the present rate. The expenses incurred in punishing the smallest theft 
that is committed exceed the present cost of educating a child in our schools fora 
year. A knayve who proposes to obtain goods by false pretenses will hardly aim at 
making less than $1,000 by his speculation. There are more than 150 towns in Mas- 
sachusetis—that is, about half the whole number in the State—in each of which the 
annual appropriation for all its schools is less than $1,000. A burglar or highway 
robber will seldom peril his life without the prospect of a prize which would educate 
500 or 1,000 children for a year. An incendiary exhibits fireworks at an expense 
which would educate all the children of many a school district in the State from the 
age of 4 to that of 16, while the only reward he expects is that of stealing a few gar- 
ments or trinkets during the conflagration. In a single city in the State, consisting 
of 16,000 or 17,000 inhabitants, it was estimated by a most respectable and intelligent 
committee, that the cost of alcoholic drinks during the last year far exceeded the 
combined cost of all the schools and all the churches in it, although, for both religion 
and education, it is a highly liberal city. The police expenses alone of the city of 
New York are about half a million a year. But all these are but a part of the sluice- 
ways through which the hard-earned wealth of the people is wasted. What shall 
be said of those stock swindlings and bank failures whose capitals of hundreds of 
thousands of dollars are embezzled in ‘‘fair business transactions;’”” whose vaults, 
sworn to be full of specie or bullion, remind one, on inspection, not merely of a 
pecuniary, but of a philosophical vacuum; what of those epidemic speculations in 
land—often fairyland, though void of both beauty and poetry—where fortunes 
change hands as rapidly as if dependent upon the throw of a gambler’s dice; and 
what of those enormous peculations by government defaulters, where more money 
is engulfed by one stupendous fraud than Massachusetts expends for the education 
of all her children ina year? All this devastation and loss the public bears with 
marvelous, with most criminal composure. The people at large stand by the wreck- 
covered shore, where so many millions are dashed in pieces and sunk, and seem not 
to recognize the destruction; and—what is infinitely worse—there are those who 
rejoice in the howl of the tempest and the shrieks of the sufferers, because they can 
grow rich by plundering only here and there a fragment of property from the dead 
or the defenseless. By charity, by direct taxes, by paying 20 or 30 per cent more for 
every article or necessary of life than it is equitably worth, by bad debts, by the 
occasional and involuntary contributions of a pocketbook, a watch, a horse, a car- 
riage, a ship, or a cargo, to which the robber and the barrator help themselves, by 
paying premiums for insurance, and in a hundred other ways, the honest and indus- 
trious part of the people not only support themselves, but supply the mighty current 
of wealth that goes to destruction through these flood-gates of iniquity. The people 
do not yet seem to see that all the costs of legislating against criminals, of judges 
and prosecuting officers, of jurors and witnesses to convict them; of building houses 
of correction, and jails and penitentiaries for restraining and punishing them, is not 
a hundredth part of the grand total of expenditure incurred by private and social 
immoralities and crimes. The people do not yet seem to see that the intelligence 
and the morality which education can impart is that beneficent kind of insurance 
which, by preventing losses, obviates the necessity of indemnifying for them—thus 
saying both premium and risk. What is engulfed in the vortex of crime, in each 
generation, would build a palace of more than Oriental splendor in every school dis-
-P-A-G-E-35

trict in the land; would endow it with a library beyond the ability of a lifetime to 
read; would supply it with apparatus and laboratories for the illustration of every 
study and the exemplification of every art, and munificently requite the services of 
a teacher worthy to preside in such a sanctuary of intelligence and virtue. Hl 
But the prevention of all that havoc of worldly goods which is caused by vice 
transfers only one item from the loss to the profit side of the account. Were all 
idle, intemperate, predatory men to become industrious, sober, and honest, they 
would add vast sums to the inventory of the nation’s wealth, instead of subtracting 
from it. Let any person take a single town, village, or neighborhood and look at 
its inhabitants individually, with the question in his mind—how many of them are 
producers and how many are nonproducers; that is, how many, either by the labor 
of the body or the labor of the mind, add value and dignity to life, and how many 
barely support themselves, and I think he will often be surprised at the smallness 
of the number by whose talent and industry the storehouses of the earth are 
mainly filled and all the complicated business of society is principally managed. 
Could we convert into coworkers for the benefit of mankind all those physical and 
spiritual powers of usefulness which are now antagonists or neutrals the gain would 
be incalculable. 
Add the two above items together—namely, the saving of what the vicious now 
squander or destroy, and the wealth which, as virtuous men, they would amass— 
and the only difficulty presented would be to find in what manner so yast an 
amount could be beneficially disposed of. 
But it is not to be disguised, whatever reforms may be instituted, that the cost of 
crime can not at once be prevented. For a season, therefore, and until the expense 
of education shall arrest and supersede the expenses of guilt, both must be borne. I 
wish to state the difficulty without extenuation. The question, then, is, Can both be 
temporarily borne? 
The appropriations for which the towns voluntarily taxed themselves last year for 
the current expenses of the schools—that is, for the wages and board of teachers 
and for fuel—were $662,870.57. Adding the income of the surplus revenue, when 
appropriated for the support of schools, it was $670,628.13. The valuation of the 
State I suppose to be not less than $450,000,000. Last year’s tax, therefore, for the 
current expenses of the schools was less than one mill and a half on the dollar—less 
than one mill and a half ona thousand mills. Taking the average of the State, then, 
no man was obliged to pay more than one six hundred and sixty-sixth part of his 
property for this purpose; or, rather, such would have been the case had there been 
no poll tax—had the whole tax been levied upon property alone. At this rate it 
would take six hundred and sixty-six years for all the property of the State to be 
once devoted to this purpose. And does not the portion of our worldly interests 
which is dependent upon public schools bear a greater ratio to the whole of those 
interests than 1 to 666? I need not argue this point, for who, out of an insane asy- 
lum—or even of the curable classes in it—will question the fact? Who will say that 
the importance of this interest as compared with all the earthly interests of mankind 
is not indefinitely greater than this? Who will say that to secure so precious an end 
as the diffusion of almost universal intelligence and virtue, and the suppression, with 
an equal degree of universality, of ignorance and vice it would not be expedient to 
do as the Bishop of Landaff once proposed that the British nation should do in an 
eventful crisis of its affairs—vote away, by acclamation, one-half of all the wealth of 
the kingdom? But there is no need of carrying our feelings or our reason to this 
pitch of exaltation. There is no need of any signal or unwonted sacrifice. There is 
no need of a devotion of life as is done in battle. There is no need of periling for- 
tunes as is done every day in trade. There is no need that any man in the commu- 
nity should lose one day from his life, or an hour from his sleep, or a comfort from 
his wardrobe or his table. Three times more than is now expended—that is, 43 mills 
   
-P-A-G-E-36
    1276 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
on every 1,000 mills of the property of the State, or only 1 part in 222, instead of 1 in 
666—would defray every expense and insure the result. Regarded merely as a com- 
mercial transaction—a pecuniary enterprise whose elements are dollars and cents 
alone—there is not an intelligent capitalist in the State who would not, on the evi- 
dence here adduced, assume the whole of it, and pay a bonus for the privilege. When 
the State was convinced of the lucrativeness or general expediency of a railroad from 
Worcester to its western border, it bound itself at a word to the amount of $5,000,000; 
and I suppose it to be now the opinion of every intelligent man in the Commonwealth 
that when the day of payment shall arrive the road itself, in addition to all the col- 
lateral advantages which it will have conferred, will have paid for itself, and will then 
foreyer remain, not merely a monument of wisdom, but a reward for sagacity. Yet, 
what is a railroad, though it does cut down the mountains and lift up the valleys, 
compared with an all-embracing agency of social and moral reform which shall abase 
the pride of power and elevate the lowliness of misfortune? And those facilities for 
travel which supersede the tediousness of former journeyings and the labor of trans- 
portation, what are they when compared with the prevention of that ‘lamentation, 
mourning, and woe’’ which come from the perpetration of crime. When the city of 
Boston was convinced of the necessity of haying a supply of pure water from abroad 
for the use of its inhabitants it voted $3,000,000 to obtain it; and he would be a bold 
man who would now propose a repeal of the ordinance, though all past expenditures 
could be refunded. Yet all the schoolhouses in Boston, which it has erected during 
the present century, are not worth a fourth part of thissum. For the supply of water 
the city of New York lately incurred an expenditure of $13,000,000. Admitting, as 
I most cheerfully do, that the use of water pertains to the moral as well as to the 
ceremonial law, yet our cities have pollutions which water can never wash away— 
defilements which the baptism of a moral and Christian education alone can remove. 
There is not an appetite that allies man to the brutes, nor a passion for vain display 
which makes him more contemptible than any part of the irrational creation, which 
does not cost the country more every year than such a system of schools as would, 
according to the evidence I have exhibited, redeem it almost entirely from its follies 
and its guilt. Consider a single factitious habit of our people, which no one will pre- 
tend adds any degree to the health, or length to the life, or decency to the manners 
of the nation—I mean the smoking of tobacco. It is said, on good authority, that 
the annual expenditure in the country for the support of this habit is $10,000,000; 
and if we reflect that this sum, averaged upon all the people, would be only half a 
dollar apiece, the estimate seems by no means extravagant. Yet this is far more than 
is paid to the teachers of all the public schools in the whole United States. 
Were nations to embark in the cause of education for the redemption of mankind, 
as they have in that of war for their destruction, the darkest chapters in the history 
of earthly calamities would soon be brought to a close. But where units have been 
grudged for education, millions have been layished for war. While for the one 
purpose mankind haye refused to part with superfiuities, for the other they have 
not only impoverished themselves, but levied burdensome taxes upon posterity. 
The vast national debts of Europe originated in war; and but for that scourge of 
mankind they never would haye existed. The amount of money now owed by the 
different European nations is said, on good authority, to be $6,387,000,000. Of this 
inconceivable sum the share of Great Britain is about $4,000,000,000 (in round num- 
bers, £800,000,000; of France, $780,000,000); of Russia and Austria, $300,000,00C each; 
of Prussia, $100,000,000; and the debts of the minor powers increase this sum to 
$6,387,000,000. The national debt of Great Britain now amounts to more than $140 
for every man, woman, and child in the three kingdoms. Allowing six persons to 
each family, it will average more than $850 to every household—a sum which would 
be deemed by thousands and tens of thousands of families in that country to be a
-P-A-G-E-37
EDUCATION AND ORIME. 1277 
handsome competence—nay, wealth itself—if it were owing to instead of from 
them. 
It is estimated that during the twenty-two years preceding the general peace of 
1815 the unimaginable sum of £6,250,000,000 sterling, or $30,000,000,000, had been 
expended in war by nations calling themselves Christians—an amount of wealth 
many fold greater than has ever been expended for the same purpose by all the 
nations on the globe whom we call savage since the commencement of the Christian 
era. The earth itself could not be pawned for so vast a sum as this, were there any 
pawnbroker’s office which would accept such a pledge Were it to be set up at 
auction, in the presence of fierce competitors for the purchase, it would not sell for 
enough to pay its war bills for a single century. The war estimates of the British 
Government, even for the current year of peace, are $85,000,000; and the annual 
interest on the national debt incurred by war is at least $120,000,000 more, or more 
than $200,000,000 for a common and, on the whole, a very favorable year. Well 
might Christ, in the Beatitudes, pronounce His emphatic benediction upon the 
“peacemakers.” 
We have emulated in this country the same gigantic scale of expenditure for the 
same purpose. “Since the organization of the Federal Government, in 1789, the 
expense of our military and naval establishments and equipments, in round num- 
bers, is $700,000,000. Two of our ships of the line have cost more than $2,000,000. 
The value of the arms accumulated at one time at the arsenal in Springfield, in this 
State, was $2,000,000. The Military.Academy at West Point has cost more than 
$4,000,000. In our town meetings and in our school-district meetings wealthy and 
substantial men oppose the grant of $15 for a school library, and of $30 for both 
library and apparatus; while at West Point they spend $50 in a single lesson at target 
firing, and the Government keeps 100 horses, and grooms and blacksmiths to take 
care of them, as an indispensable part of the apparatus of the Academy. The pupils 
at our normal schools, who are preparing to become teachers, must maintain them- 
selves; the cadets at the Academy receive $28 a month during their entire term as a 
compensation for being educated at the public expense. Adding bounties and pen- 
sions to wages and rations, I suppose the cost of a common foot soldier in the Army 
can not be less than $250 a year. The average cost of female teachers in the public 
schools of Massachusetts last year was only $13.60 a month, inclusive of board, or at 
arate which would give $163.20 for the year; but the average length of the schools 
was but 8 months, so that the cost of two common soldiers is nearly that of five 
female teachers. The annual salary of a colonel of dragoons in the United States 
Army is $2,206; of a brigadier-general, $2,958; of a major-general, $4,512; that of a 
captain of a ship of the line, when in service, $4,500; and even when off duty it is 
$2,500. There are but seven towns in Massachusetts where any teacher of a public 
school receives so high a salary as $1,000, and in four of these towns one teacher only 
receives this sum. 
Had my purpose been simply to show the pecuniary ability of the people at large 
to give the most generous compensation to such a company of accomplished, high- 
minded, noble teachers as would lift the race at once out of the pit of vice and 
ignorance and superstition, as safely and as tenderly as a mother bears her infant in 
her arms; had my purpose been merely to show this pecuniary ability, then I have 
already said too much. But my design was not merely to carry conviction to the 
minds of those who would contest this fact, but to make the denial of it ridiculous. 
III. But the consummation of this reformatory work is not promised except upon 
the performance of a third condition,—namely, that all the children in the State 
between the ages of 4 and 16 years shall be brought into school for ten months in each 
year. In other words, while the schools are kept the attendance of all the children 
upon them, with one or two exceptions to be hereafter noticed, must be regular. 
       
-P-A-G-E-38
  1278 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
Since the keeping of registers in our schools has made known the enormous amount 
of absences from them there is but one subject which has excited greater alarm or 
given rise to louder complaints. Teachers complain of this absence, because, while 
it increases their labors, it diminishes their success; indeed, it makes entire success 
an impossibility. Parents who do send their children regularly to school complain 
of it, because the tardy and the occasional comers are a dead weight upon the prog- 
ress of those who are uniformly present and prompt. Committees complain of it 
in behalf of the towns which they represent, because it lowers the general standard 
of intelligence among the people, and because, taken on an average for the whole 
State, it incurs a total loss of from one-third to one-half of all the money which is 
annually levied by taxation for the support of schools. Men of wealth who have no 
children to send to school, or who for any reason send none, complain of it, because, 
though they may be willing to be taxed for the education of all, yet they are not 
willing to be taxed to have their money taken and thrown away. They think it, 
and with good reason, too, to be an intolerable hardship to be first confronted with 
the argument that they are bound to secure the general intelligence and morality of 
the people through the instrumentality of schools, and when they have acknowl- 
edged the validity of this argument and cheerfully paid their money to have the 
very men who so argued and so claimed turn upon them and say, We are still at 
liberty to throw your money away by keeping our children at home; and though you 
must keep the school regularly for us we have a right to use it irregularly, or not at 
all, as we please. Thus the delinquents, where they owe apology and repentance, 
retort with indignity and persevere in injustice. 
I can not believe that our people will always, or even long, submit to this enormous 
abuse, now made known to them by well-authenticated documents. For an econo- 
mical people, who form political parties on the subject of expenditures by the Goy- 
ernment and make ‘‘retrenchment’’ a watch-word; for a people whose legislature 
sometimes debates for days together whether the salary of an officer shall be a few 
hundred dollars more or less, to continue to throw away, as was done last year, more 
than $200,000 on account of voluntary, gratuitous, and, in most cases, wanton 
absences from school is not credible. For a people who are sufficiently proud, to 
say the least, of their general intelligence and who are sincerely anxious to perpet- 
uate and improve their moral character, to be willing to forfeit one-third part of all 
the blessings of their free school system, without any necessity or any plausible pre- 
text, is not to be believed. This great evil must be dealt with according to its mag- 
nitude. Violent diseases demand energetic remedies. It would be as unwise in a 
State as in an individual to allow its precautions to diminish while its dangers 
increase; to sleep more quietly as peril becomes more imminent. When we know 
that a malady is dangerous and that-a remedy is at hand wisdom dictates its speedy 
application. 
I propose, then, to consider the objections that may possibly be urged to the regular 
attendance of all our children upon school for ten months in each year, from the age 
of 4 to that of 16 years. I believe them to be by no means insurmountable; nay, 
that their formidableness will wholly disappear if subjected to a candid examination. 
1. Itmay be said that there is a class of parents amongst us who depend partially 
upon the labor of their children for the support of their families, and who are too 
poor to forego the earnings of these children for ten months in the year and for 
twelve years of their minority. 
With regard to a portion of the class of parents referred to this suggestion would 
have a foundation in fact; with regard to another portion of them it would have no 
such foundation. It is well known that a class of parents exists amongst us who 
work their children that they may themselves be idle; who coin the health, the 
capacities, and the future welfare of their own offspring into money, which money 
when gained is not expended for the necessaries or the comforts of life, but is wasted. 
 
-P-A-G-E-39
5 EDUCATION AND ORIME.- 1279 
upon appetites that brutify or demonize their possessor. The objections of this class 
against permitting their children to be educated at the public expense are not legiti- 
mate. It would be infinitely better for them, for their families, and for the publicif 
they were cut off from these means of sinful indulgence. It would improve their 
condition still further if they were obliged to be industrious, even though coerced 
to labor by the goads of hunger and cold. The best of all conditions forthem would 
be that they should themselves labor for the support of their children at. school, 
where those intellectual and virtuous habits would be formed and that filial piety 
inculeated which would lead the children in after years to return to their parents, 
with a generous requital, the favors they had received. 
There is, doubtless, another portion of this general class with whom the alleged 
necessity for their children’s earnings as a part of the means for family support is 
no pretence. The number or age of the family, sickness, misfortune, or other cause 
may render this or some other resource indispensable to the procurement of the 
necessaries and decencies of life. I would notunderrate thenumber of the necessities 
of this class of persons; they have claims upon our warmest sympathies; but I have 
reason to believe that the class itself is not a very large one. Where the heads of the 
family enjoy good health; where they may have the assistance of their children 
who are of an age able to render it, for several hours each day, for one or two entire 
half days each week and for two months uninterruptedly each year the circum- 
stances must be peculiar where industry and frugality, with such favors as the honest 
and praiseworthy poor may always count upon from their better-conditioned neighbors, 
will not supply the means of a comfortable subsistence. 
Still cases of necessity do and will exist; and where the need is not supplied by 
individual charity there is no other alternative but to do it at the public expense. 
This would introduce no new principle into our legislation. It would be only a 
moderate but highly beneficial extension of an existing one. Our laws now provide 
for physical destitution, whatever may be its cause; and they enjoin upon school 
committees the duty of furnishing all needful school books at the expense of their 
respective towns, to all children whose parents are unable to procure them. 
The question then arises, What degree of destitution—and there is no propriety in 
restricting this to physical destitution—makes it expedient for a wise government to 
interfere and afford relief? ‘‘ Poor laws,” as we understand the term, are of modern 
origin. They were not only unknown to all barbarous nations, but to most Christian 
and civilized ones, until a recent period. In England they date from the reign of 
Elizabeth. In Scotland, although in a small class of extreme cases legal relief may 
have been rendered, yet ‘‘poor laws’’ can hardly be said ever to have had an 
effective existence in that country. In Ireland they were unknown until recently. 
In this country they are almost coeval with our colonial settlements. 
But there neither is, nor ever has been, any legal standard of poverty. The degree 
of destitution which shall entitle the sufferer to relief is not a fixed quantity, like 
the statutory length of a yard, or the Winchester bushel. The general notions of 
men as to what constitutes poverty range between wide extremes, according to their 
prevalent style of living, their enlightenment, and their benevolence. It is said that 
when the present King of France heard that the income of the Jewish banker in 
London amounted only to some hundreds of dollars each hour, he expressed his 
deep grief at learning that he was so poor. With us he who can command a com- 
fortable shelter, decent clothes, and a sufficient supply of wholesome food for himself 
and family excites no special commiseration for his poverty; while there are places 
upon the earth where a potato a day is considered an independent fortune. Now, 
between these extremes, what shall the true definition of poverty be? 
So the line which divides poverty from competence is not a stationary, but a mova- 
ble one. The laws themselves change; and the same law, on a question like this, 
will be made to speak a very different language under different administrators. In

favor of the militia, or of the country’s defense, our law exempts from attachment, 
execution, and distress, whether for debt or for taxes, the uniform, arms, ammuni- 
tion, and accouterments which officers, noncommissioned officers, and privates are 
required to possess. In favor of the common sentiments of humanity, our law 
exempts also from attachment and execution not only wearing apparel, but a great 
variety of articles of household furniture—bedsteads, beds, bedding, an iron stove, 
fuel, and other commodities, to the value of $50; also a cow, six sheep, one swine, 
and two tons of hay; also the tools and implements used by a debtor in his trade, not 
exceeding $50 in value; and also rights of burial, and tombs used as repositories for 
the dead. Our legislation on this subject has been humanely progressive, as may be 
seen by reference to statutes 1805, chapter 100; 1813, chapter 172; 1822, chapter 93, 
section 8; 1832, chapter 58; 1838, chapter 145, etc. In a neighboring State, by a late 
law, a portion of the debtor’s homestead is also brought within the same rule. In 
favor of learning and religion, all schoolbooks and Bibles used in the family are 
also exempted from attachment and execution for debt; and, as was before said, all 
schoolchildren destitute of schoolbooks are first supplied with them at the public 
expense, and where the parents are unable to reimburse the cost the supply is gra- 
tuitous. Massachusetts has from time to time founded and endowed hospitals for the 
insane, and she makes annual and liberal appropriations for the education of the blind 
and the deaf and dumb. She is now engaged in erecting a noble institution for the 
reformation of juvenile delinquents; and a commission, instituted by her, is inquir- 
ing at the present time into the condition of idiots, which unfortunate, repulsive, 
and hitherto outcast portion of the community, it is not to be doubted, she will soon. 
gather together and, in imitation of the noble examples set by France, Switzerland, 
and Prussia, will educate to cleanliness, to decency, and to no inconsiderable degree 
of positive enjoyment and usefulness. Each one, too, of all these great move- 
ments, when carried out into execution, has proved economical, as well as phil- 
anthropic and Christian. What striking results, in proof of this, are exhibited by 
the statistics of the State Lunatic Hospital at Worcester. According to the last 
report of that institution which Dr. Woodward made, the average expense of 
24 old cases, taking the first 24 on the list, and not selecting them or taking 
them at random, was $1,945.83 each, and their aggregate expense $46,700; while 
the average expense of the same number of recent cases, taking the last on the list 
who were discharged cured, was $41.53 each, and their aggregate expense $996.75; 
so that the whole expense of twenty-four recent cases was but about one-half as 
much as of one old one. That hospital already has far more than paid for itself by 
the saving it has effected, because without it all the new cases would have been old. 
ones. I present these economical aspects of the subject by no means because I deem 
them to be the most important, but because all over the world there is a large class 
of persons with whom the pecuniary argument is the most persuasive and eloquent, 
and who will be induced to lend their services in aid of great social ameliorations 
only when they find that humanity is economy and that ‘godliness’’ is ‘‘great 
gain” in.a worldly sense. They will then enlist for the sake of the ‘‘great gain,” 
though quite indifferent as to the other quality. When I have been asked by per- 
sons from the fertile and exuberant regions of our own country or from transatlantic 
nations how it is that with our ungenerous soil and ungenial clime we are pecuni- 
arily able to support these various and costly establishments, my answer has been 
that we are able because we do support them. 
But the question recurs, What is poverty? What is that straitness of circumstances 
which for educational purposes would require a wise and profound statesman, and, 
of course, the State itself, to interpose and to supply those means for the education of 
the child which the parent is unable to render? It being proved if all our children 
were to be brought under the benignant influences of such teachers as the State can 
supply from the age of 4 years to that of 16, and for ten months in each year, 
 
-P-A-G-E-41

that ninety-nine in every hundred of them can be rescued from uncharitableness, 
from falsehood, from intemperance, from cupidity, licentiousness, violence, and 
fraud, and reared to the performance of all the duties and to the practice of all the 
kindnesses and courtesies of domestic and social life—made promoters of the com- 
mon weal instead of subtractors from it—this being proved, I respectfully and with 
deference submit to the board, and through them to the legislature and to my fellow 
citizens at large, that every man is poor in an educational sense who can not both 
spare and equip his children for school for the entire period above specified; and 
that while he remains thus poor it is not only the dictate of generosity and Chris- 
tianity, but it is the wisest policy and profoundest statesmanship, too, to supply from 
the public treasury—municipal or State, or both—whatever means may be wanted 
to make certain so glorious an end. These principles and this practice the divine 
doctrines of Christianity have always pointed at, and a progressive civilization has 
now brought us into proximity to them. How is it that we can call a man poor 
because his body is cold, and not because his highest sympathies and affections have 
been frozen up within him in one polar and perpetual winter from his birth? 
Hunger does not stint the growth of the body half so much as ignorance dwarts the 
capacities of the mind. No wound upon the limbs or gangrene of vital organs is a 
thousandth part so terrible as those maladies of the soul that jeopard its highest 
happiness and defeat the end for which it was created. And infinitely aggravated 
is the case where children are the sufferers; where moral distempers are inflicted 
upon them by parents or are inherited by them from ancestors; where they are born. 
into an atmosphere saturated with the infection of crime; where vice obtrudes itself 
upon eyery sense and presses inward through every pore to be imbibed and copied 
just as the common air forces itself into the nostrils to be breathed, and where in 
their early imitative transgressions they are no more consciously guilty than in the 
heaving of their lungs in an act of respiration. 
Were a ship in midocean to be overtaken by a storm, to be dismantled, dismasted, 
and reduced to an unmanageble hulk, and while its crew were famishing and in 
momentary danger of foundering, were another ship to pass within hail, but to refuse 
all succor and deliverance, should we not justly regard the deed as an enormous 
atrocity? But what moral difference does it make whether we pass by our perish- 
ing ‘“‘neighbor”’ on the sea or on the dry land? The pitfalls of perdition on shore 
are deeper and far more terrible, and are inhabited by direr monsters, than any 
ocean caves. Now, it is the children of the man who through sickness or other 
misfortune has not the means fully and thoroughly to educate them for the duties 
of life who represent this perishing and foundering crew, and the man who has 
superfluities, or even an independency of means, but refuses to aid in giving these 
children an education sufficient for all the common responsibilities of life, he is the 
hardened mariner who sails recklessly by and sees the helpless sufferers engulfed in 
the wake of his own proud vessel. 
On this point, then, are we not authorized to conclude, in the first place, that the 
cases are comparatively few where parents can not afford to forego the earnings of 
their children and to send them to school for the length of time and with the regu- 
larity proposed; and, in the second place, were the cases of destitution far more 
numerous than they are, that there is still an abundance of means as well as an 
obvious duty on the part of the public to supply all deficiencies? Assuming the 
value of all the property in the State to be $450,000,000, the simple interest upon it 
alone at 6 per cent, and without any addition from earnings, is $27,000,000 annually. 
The industrial statistics of the State show that its income from all its occupations 
and trades is more than $100,000,000 annually, and even this does not include 
improvements upon its wharves, bridges, roads, or lands. Must such a State pare 
and clip and scrimp, and dole out its means with a niggardly hand when unfolding 
the mortal and the immortal capacities of its children?

2. But though the means for supporting the schools are abundant, and though the 
earnings of children as a part of the family’s daily livelihood may be foreborne in one 
class of cases and made up in the other, a further question still remains, Can the State 
itself afford to forego these juvenile services? Can the machinery be operated, the 
shoes bound, the types set, the errands and ‘‘ chores”’ done, and the doorbells tended 
if all children under 16 years of age are withdrawn from the performance of these 
kinds of service for ten months each year? Minors under 16 are let out to corpora- 
tions to be employed in manufacturing establishments; they are taken into the fami- 
lies of the wealthy and forehanded as underservants; a few are employed as errand 
boys in the offices and shops of cities, and in several of the lighter handicrafts they 
are put to regular labor. There are no exact data by which to determine the num- 
ber of children so employed in the State. Compared with the whole number of 
children in it between the ages of 4 and 16, I suppose it to be inconsiderable, so 
inconsiderable, indeed, that if their services in these employments were henceforth 
to be wholly discontinued it would subtract hardly an appreciable fraction from the 
aggregate products of our labor and machinery. A highly intelligent gentleman, 
who has been engaged in manufacturing business for many years, informs me that 
the company with which he is associated now employs 3,119 persons, namely, 2,571 
in five cotton mills, 450 in two machine shops, and 98 in one woolen mill. In the 
cotton mills 346 persons are employed who are under 16 years of age, equal to 13 per 
cent. In the machine shops there are none. In the woolen mill there are 6, or 6 
per cent. The average for the whole is about 11 per cent. He adds: ‘‘I am of the 
opinion that this statement may be taken as a fair representation, in regard to age, 
of the persons in these several employments. Very few are under 15. * * * 
This class of labor is not profitable to the employer, and, except in particular cases, 
is only employed from motives of charity. From my recollection of the labor 
required in print works [he was formerly extensively engaged in printing calicoes], 
Iam inclined to think the proportion of persons under 16 is not greater than the 
average in the mills and shops before mentioned.” 
Here, then, is a statement worthy of implicit reliance respecting the largest branch 
of labor in which those children are employed who, on the proposed reformatory 
plan, would be sent to school. Can a substitute be found for this juvenile labor? 
In the first place, if that class of parents who now coin into money their children’s 
highest capacities for usefulness and enjoyment that they themselves may live in 
idleness and intemperance were peremptorily deprived of this source of gain they 
could perform a portion of the labor now exacted of the children; or, if not capable 
of performing this particular kind of labor, they could at least do some other work, 
and thus set free a class of persons who could perform it, 
In the second place, manufacturers could employ, at a slightly enhanced price, a 
few more adults, or more persons over the age of 16. I trust that no liberal-minded 
manufacturer would object to employing older help at the present time on the plea 
of nonremunerating returns. 
But, thirdly—a consideration of more significance than all the rest—the children 
who had enjoyed such a school development and training as we are now supposing 
would go into the mills, after the completion of their educational course, with phys- 
ical and intellectual ability to help and with a moral inability to harm, which of 
itself would far more than compensate for all the loss of their previous absence. 
Take any manufacturer whose mind has ever wandered, even by chance, to a con- 
templation of the only true sources and securities of wealth, and what would he not 
give to have all his operatives transformed at once into men and women of high 
intelligence and unswerving morality; to have them become so faithful and honest 
that they would always turn out the greatest quantity and the best quality of work, 
without the trouble and expense of watching, and weighing, and counting, and 
superintending; that they would be as careful of his machinery as though it were 
 
-P-A-G-E-43
EDUCATION AND CRIME. 1283 
their own; that they would never ask or accept more in payment than their just 
due; that they would always consult their employer’s interest, and never sacrifice it 
from motives of personal ease, or gain, or ill-will. 
+ TI have been told by one of our most careful and successiul manufacturers that, on 
substituting, in one of his cotton mills, a better for a poorer educated class of operatives, 
he was enabled to add 12 or 15 per cent to the speed of his machinery, without any 
increase of damage or danger from the acceleration. Here there was a direct gain of 
12 or 15, per cent—a larger percentage than that of the supposed whole number of 
children under 16 years of age in all our factories. And this gain was effected, too, 
without any additional investment of capital or any increased expense for board. 
The gain from improved morals would far exceed that from increased intelligence. 
On the whole, then, if all children under 16 years of age were withdrawn from the 
factories for ten months of each year, in order to be sent to school, there is reason to 
believe that the aggregate amount of the fabrics produced by the mills would not be 
diminished even a yard. 
The above considerations have special reference to children employed in factories. 
I have selected this department of labor because I suppose that at least as many 
children under 16 are let out to service in factories as in all other branches of 
business taken together. The same views, with inconsiderable modifications, will 
apply to all others. It will be seen at a glance, therefore, that the contemplated 
diversion of children from manual labor to mental and moral pursuits will not be 
such as to impair the industrial resources of the State or to diminish the marketable 
value of its products. 
But there is one remark which applies alike to all these classes of employers. 
They use the services of children not their own. Now, it must be conceded that 
there exists 2 well-grounded reluctance, on the part of free governments, to any such 
interference with parental relations as is not made necessary by the nature of the 
government itself or by the criminal conduct or culpable neglect of the parents, 
But those who employ other men’s children for their own profit can not intrench 
themselves behind the sacredness of parental rights. Their object is their own per- 
sonal gain, a lawful and laudable object, it is true, when pursued by justifiable 
means, but one which can not sanction for a moment the infliction of a positive 
injury upon any child, or the deprivation of any privilege essential either to his well- 
being or to the permanence and prosperity of the Republic. The Republic, indeed, 
if true to itself, can never allow any of its members to do what will redound to its 
own injury; and, where no parental title can be alleged, the assertion of any right 
over the labor of children has as little foundation in natural justice or equity as the 
. tyrant’s claim to the toil of his vassals. How can any man, having any claim to the 
character, I will not say of a Christian or a philanthropist, but to the vastly lower 
one of a patriot, use the services of a child in his household, his shop, his office, or 
his mill when he knows that he does it at the sacrifice, to say the least, of that child’s 
highest earthly interests? How can any man seek to enlarge his own gains, or to 
pamper his own luxurious habits, by taking the bread of intellectual and moral life 
from the children around him? 
I can anticipate but one objection more having the aspect of plausibility. It may 
be said that although the schools should be kept for the proposed length of time by 
teachers ennobled with all the intellectual and moral attributes contemplated, yet 
there are persons capable, like brutes, of bringing children into the world, but 
impervious to those moral considerations which should impel them to train up those 
children in the way they should go, and that in regard to this class of parents some 
coercive measures will be necessary to secure the attendance of their children at 
school. Iadmit this. But is coercion a new idea in a community where there are 
houses of correction, and jails, and State prisons, and the gallows? Surely bolts and 
bars, granite walls, and strangulating hemp are strange emblems of the voluntary

principle. Massachusetts has at the present moment about two thousand persons 
under lock and key, nineteen-twentieths of whom, had they been blessed with a 
good common-school education, would, according to the testimony I have adduced, 
be now useful and exemplary citizens, building up instead of tearing down the fabric 
of public welfare. With a population of between 800,000 and 900,000 she has at 
least 5,000 police officers and magistrates, armed with power to seize and restrain 
and bring to trial and punishment any transgressors of those laws which she has 
paid many other thousands for enacting. Does it not argue, then, a perversion of 
intellect or an obliquity of the moral sense to contend that a child, for the purpose 
of being blessed by the influences of a good school, can not be taken from a parent 
who is preparing him to become at least a private, if not an officer, in the great army 
of malefactors, while it is conceded that by and by, when this same child becomes a 
parent, he may then be taken from his children, imprisoned, put to hard labor, or 
put to death? So far as force is concerned, so far as any supposed invasion of private 
rights is concerned, does not the greater contain the less a thousand times over? If 
the State can send a sheriff's posse to take a man from his own bed at midnight and 
carry him to jail, to trial, and to execution, does it require a greater extension or a 
bolder use of its prerogatives for the same State to send a kind, moral guardian to 
take a child from the temptations of the street or from the haunts of wickedness and 
bring him within the benign influences of a good school? 
Should it be said that in the case of the adult offender there has been a forfeiture 
of civil rights by some overt act of violation, while in the case of the child the viola- 
tion is prospective only, I reply that nothing is more common than to arrest and 
imprison men on probable suspicion merely; nothing is more common than to hold 
men to bail in sums proportioned to the suspected offense, and when a man gives 
proof that he intends to do a wrong and is only awaiting a favorable opportunity to 
execute his intention nothing is more common than to put him under bonds for his 
good behavior. Every child who is not receiving a good education comes at least 
within these latter categories. He is an object of violent suspicion. The presump- 
tion is strong that he will not make a good citizen; that in some form or other he 
will get his living out of the earnings of his fellow-men or offend against their 
welfare. If the Commonwealth, then, has a right to imprison an adult, or hold him 
to bail on suspicion, or to bind him over to keep the peace and be of good behavior, 
has it not an equal, nay, a superior, right to demand guaranties for the child’s 
appearance upon the stage of manhood, there to answer to the great duties that shall 
be required of him as a citizen? And a good education is surely better security than 
any bail bond that ever was executed. Has not the State a right to bind each child 
to his good behavior by imparting to him the instruction and by instilling into his 
mind the principles of virtue and religion, by which he shall be twice bound or 
doubly fastened (for such is the etymological meaning of the word religion) to per- 
form with intelligence and uprightness his social and political duties when he 
becomes a man? 
Nor is our legislation without numerous precedents in favor of securing education 
even at the expense of coercive measures. These precedents are scattered along our 
annals from the earliest periods of our colonial existence. The colonial law of 1642, 
alter premising that ‘‘forasmuch as the good education of children is of singular 
behoof and benefit to any Commonwealth,’’ ordered ‘‘that the selectmen of every 
town * * * shall have a vigilant eye over their brethren and neighbors, to see, 
first, that none of them shall suffer so much barbarism in any of their families as not 
to endeavor to teach, by themselves or others, their children and apprentices so 
much learning as may enable them perfectly to read the English tongue, and knowl- 
edge of the capital laws;’’ and it imposed upon parents what, in those times, was a 
heavy penalty for neglect.
-P-A-G-E-45
  *EDUCATION AND CRIME. 1285 
By the law of 1671 the selectmen were again required to see that all children and 
youth ‘‘be taught to read perfectly the English tongue, have knowledge in the 
capital laws,’’ ete. 
So the laws of the Plymouth Colony, after setting forth that ‘‘whereas many 
Parents & Masters either through an over respect to their own occasions and business, 
or not duely considering the good of their Children & Servants, have too much 
neglected their duty in their Education, whilest they are young & capable of Learn- 
ing;’’ proceeded to make substantially the same requirements as were made by the 
above-cited provisions in the laws of the Massachusetts Bay Colony; and then 
declared that if any parents or masters, after warning and admonition, should still 
remain negligent in their duty, ‘‘whereby Children & Servants may be in danger-to 
grow Barberous, Rude or Stubborn, & so prove Pests instead of a to the 
Country,’”’ then ‘‘a fine of ten shillings shall be levied upon the goods of such negli- 
gent Parent or Master.” If, after three months subsequent to the levying of this 
fine, ‘“‘no due care shall be taken & continued, for the education of such children & 
apprentices,”’ then a fine of twenty shillings was to be levied. ‘‘And Lastly, if in 
three months after that, there be no Reformation of the said neglect, then the Select- 
men, with the help of two Magistrates, shall take such children & servants from 
them [the parents,] & place them with some Masters for years, (boyes till they 
come to twenty-one, and girls eighteen years of age, ) which will more strictly educate 
and govern them, according to the rules of this Order.”’ 
Nor were the above enactments a dead letter. The earlier judicial and municipal 
records show that when the natural parent broke from the ties of consanguinity and 
duty by neglecting the education of his children the law interfered and provided a 
civil parent for them. 
Modern legislation, it is true, has greatly relaxed the stringency of these provisions. 
No adequate substitute is to be found for them in our present educational code; and 
already neglected childhood is avenging itself upon society by its manhood of crime, 
not unfrequently by its precocity in crime, long before the years of manhood have 
been reached. 3 
Compulsory enactments, however, still attest that all the spirit of our ancestors is 
not yet gone. Our laws provide in various cases that minor children may be bound 
out to service—males to the age of 21 years and females to the age of 18 years—but 
in all cases it is to be stipulated in the contract that they shall be taught to ‘‘read, 
write, and cipher.’’? ‘Stubborn children’? may be committed to the house of cor- 
rection. Children in the city of Boston under the age of 16 years, whose ‘parents 
are dead or, if living, do, from vice or any other cause, neglect to provide suitable 
employment for or to exercise salutary control over’? them, may be sent by the 
court to the house of reformation. By the late act establishing the State reform 
school male convicts under 16 years of age may be sent to this school from any 
part of the Commonwealth, to be there ‘instructed in piety and morality, and in 
such branches of useful knowledge as shall be adapted to their age and capacity.” 
The inmates may be bound out; but, in executing this part of their duty, the trustees 
“shall have scrupulous regard to the religious and moral character of those to whom 
they are to be bound, to the end that they may secure to the boys the benefit of a 
good example and wholesome instruction, and the sure means of improvement in 
virtue and knowledge, and thus the opportunity of becoming intelligent, moral, use- 
ful, and happy citizens of the Commonwealth.’? Manufacturers and overseers in 
manufacturing establishments are prohibited under a penalty from employing any 
child in their factories under 15 years of age who has not attended some day school 
for a specified portion of the year within which he may be so employed; and they 
are also prohibited from employing any child under 12 years of age more than ten 
hours a day under any circumstances. In the case of fires, of explosive commodities,
-P-A-G-E-46
  
  1286 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
of contagious diseases, of immigrant passengers from infected countries, etc., the law 
vests its officers with plenary and summary powers “‘to save the Republic from 
detriment.”’ 
Paley has said that ‘‘to send an uneducated child into the world is injurious to 
the rest of mankind; it is little better than to turn out a mad dog ora wild beast 
into the streets.’”” It is difficult to conceive why he thought it to be any ‘‘ better,” 
since one uneducated, vicious man may do infinitely more harm to the world than 
all the rabid dogs or wild beasts that ever existed. Much as we may need energetic 
remedies against contagious diseases, we need them against contagious vices more; 
and quarantine laws in favor of moral health are the most necessary of all sanitary 
regulations. 
But I forbear to press further considerations of this character upon the attention 
of the board. -I hope that the great majority of our people will rather wonder why 
such an argument should be deemed necessary than be disposed to question its 
conclusions. 
Having now surveyed somewhat at length the various points pertaining to this 
subject, a brief recapitulation may not be amiss. 
The basis on which it is suggested that our public-school system shall be put is 
carefully defined in the circular. 
In some important particulars no change is necessary, as our practice has already 
reached the point of theoretic excellence. Such are the unconditional rights of all 
children to enter the school—or their entire exemption from rate bills or any capita- 
tion tax, either as a condition precedent or subsequent of their attending school— 
the range of studies which may be taught; the provision for moral and religious 
instruction, with guaranties against its abuse, and so forth. 
But, in other respects, important improvements are contemplated—no cardinal or 
organic change in the system itself, but only progression in courses already begun. 
Such are more befitting qualifications in teachers for the great work they undertake; 
the maintenance of the schools for a period of ten months in each year, instead of the 
present average of eight months;-and, as a necessary consequence, the appropriation of 
moneys sufficient to sustain the prolonged school, and to pay the better qualified 
teachers; and, finally, the gathering into the schools, during their entire term, of all 
the children in the community between the ages of 4 and 16 years. 
From the comprehensiveness of this last condition it is obvious that all cases of 
sickness, casualty, or other reasonable cause of absence, must be excepted. And 
equally clear is it that when any parent or guardian prefers to educate his children 
at home or in a private school, he should be allowed to do so—the means of educa- 
tion to be left wholly optional with everyone, provided assurance is given to the 
State that the end is attained. 
So far as the proposed changes involve the appropriation of more money, it has 
been shown that the State possesses not only a sufficiency, but a redundancy of 
wealth for the purpose. Besides, when once in operation, the system will be found, 
not merely a self-supporting one, but one yielding large revenues, both saying and 
producing many times more than it will cost, requiting a single expenditure by a 
manifold remuneration. 
So far as higher mental and moral attributes in teachers will be required, reasons 
have been offered to show that Nature, or the common course of Providence, supplies 
an abundance of intellectual power and of moral capability; but that through our 
present misuse or maladministration of these noble qualities they are either lost by 
neglect of culture or diverted to less worthy pursuits. There is no more iron in the 
world now than there ever was. We have only discovered how to use it more advan- 
tageously, for steamboats, for railroads, for machinery, and a thousand mechanical 
purposes; and thus in point of mere pecuniary value we haye given it the first rank 
among the precious metals. There is no more water flowing down our streams now  
-P-A-G-E-47
  
EDUCATION AND ORIME. 2 Be 
than there was centuries ago. But we have just found out how to make it saw timber, 
grind wheat, and make cloth; and already it does a thousand times more work than 
all our 20,000,000 people could do, by their own unassisted strength, should every man 
vie with his neighbor in the severity of his toil and in the amount of his productions. 
There are no more individual particles of electricity in the air or in the earth to-day 
than there always have been. Forever since the creation there has been an inconceiy- 
able host of these particles—a multitude deriding all human power of computation— 
which have careered round the earth by laws of their own, each one being as distinct 
from all the rest and having as separate and independent an existence as one wild 
horse upon the prairies hasfrom another. Long ago science learned how to catch and 
confine thege natural racers, but it was not until our day that she discovered how to 
take them—one, ten, a hundred, or a thousand-—and dispatch them as messengers to 
distant cities—to make them the common carriers of intelligence, whom no pursuers 
can overtake, no bribe can corrupt, nor robbers despoil. Thus itis with the capacities 
of the human mind. By the bounty of Providence they may be employed and made 
sufficient for the greatest work of reform. It is through our blindness and perversity 
that they are not yet used to achieve their sublime purposes. Like the iron, like the 
gravity of falling water, like the electric coursers, they, too, have the power of con- 
ferring unimaginable blessings upon the race; but as yet they have only been very 
partially enlisted in the highest services of humanity. 
On the third point—that which contemplates the regular attendance of all the 
children upon the school (with certain specified exceptions), and even their compul- 
sory attendance in a class of extreme cases—I rely upon legal precedents and analo- 
gies—upon the necessity which is imposed upon a republican government if it means 
to keep itself republican, and upon the broad principle that a parent who neglects to 
educate his child up to the point proposed proves that he has taken the parental 
relation upon himself without any corresponding idea of its solemnity, and thus, by 
the nonperformance of his parental duties, forfeits his parental rights. * * * 
Such, then, isa condensed view or summary of the testimony given by credible 
and trustworthy witnesses on a subject so unspeakably important. The judicial 
mind can not fail to observe that the section of country whence these results of 
experience have been gathered is large, embracing all the States north and east of 
Pennsylvania. The schools have been both public and private, in town and country, 
have consisted of both sexes and of all ages, and have contained children from all 
the States in the Union. They have embraced thousands and thousands of the 
youth of the land; and commencing at a point of time now,more than fifty years 
gone by they reach in unbroken continuity to the present day. We have, therefore, 
no isolated or solitary case, illogically generalized, and made to yield an inference 
too broad for its premises. = 
The coincidence of the results, too, to which the witnesses have come is on its 
face a very remarkable circumstance; but it is rendered still more remarkable by the 
fact that they made their statements without any concert or comparison of views, 
and in entire independence of each other. The proof, therefore, is not cumulative 
merely; but its cogency is raised to a mathematical power equal to the number of the 
witnesses. 
Nor is it to be forgotten that. each of the witnesses, in theological character, is a 
sincere believer in such an innate natural condition of the human heart as opposes 
the most formidable obstacles to success in moral training. Sovereign, indeed, must 
be the influences which can educe exemplary lives and a well-ordered society from a 
race each one of whom could say, literally, ‘‘I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin 
did my mother conceive me,”’ in a race whose alienation from the righteous law of 
God is supposed to antedate volition and even consciousness, and to be mingled and 
inbred with the primary corpuscles of being. It was no disrespect toward the many 
able and eminent teachers of a different religious faith which deterred me from pro- 
 
-P-A-G-E-48
  1288 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
pounding the same questions to them and soliciting the results of their experience. 
But it was because I wished to know what was deemed to be practicable by those 
who saw the greatest difficulties to be overcome before success could be achieved. 
While, therefore, their statements were solicited, respecting the moral efficacy or 
“potentiality” of schools ‘conducted on the cardinal principles of the New Eng- 
land systems,’’ yet it was my wish that each one should make his own theological 
views manifest on the face of his communication; so that governors, and legislators, 
and all leaders of public opinion, might see how much was believed to be attainable, 
even while contending against the most formidable obstacles. I reasoned thus, that 
if those who believe the battle ground to be most nearly inaccessible, and the 
enemy’s intrenchments to be most nearly impregnable, and his power to be most 
nearly invincible, do still believe that victory can be won—then all would gay, there 
should be no sleep in the camp until the war cry is rung and the hand-to-hand 
struggle is begun. 
But I must not disguise the fact, nor in any way divert attention from it, that 
universality of education either public or private, is a substantive part of the plan 
here proposed and indispensable to its successful working. Indeed, I should have 
thought it nugatory and trifling to ask the opinion of any teacher about attainable 
results had this condition been omitted from the scheme. Had it been stipulated 
or supposed as a preliminary of the plan that 1 per cent only of the children might 
be left out of the schools, doubtless the witnesses would have made a deduction of 
at least 5 per cent in their estimate of results. They would have felt bound to make 
an allowance, not only for the abandoned class themselves, but for the poisonous 
influence of that class upon all the rest. Doubtless every advance in the qualification 
of teachers and in gathering more and more of the children within the renovating 
influences of the schools will yield a great reward of mental and moral benefits, but 
universality in the end to be accomplished demands universality in the means to be 
employed. Ifa contagious or infectious distemper were to break out in any quarter 
of the city and all its victims but one were to be removed, though this removal would 
abate something from the malignant type of the disease, and contract the circle of 
its ravages, yet who would feel secure while even one should remain to impart its 
virus by contact or radiate its noxious effluvia? In moral no less than in physical 
maladies the security of each is conditioned on the security of all. The confidence 
of every rational man must be impaired respecting the prospective virtue of his own 
children while the children of his neighbor are vicious, and for the comprehensive 
meaning of the word ‘‘neighbor’’ Christ is our authority. I thank God that there 
can be no safety for any until there is safety for all. Were the sky to be opened 
and a voice to address us audibly from the heavens it could not proclaim more artic- 
ulately than is done by the common course of Divine Providence that God has 
made of one blood all nations of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, and that 
therefore, being by the law of consanguinity one brotherhood and one body, no 
one member of this body can suffer but all the members must suffer with it, and no 
one member can be truly honored but all the members must rejoice with it. Where 
men are religious, therefore, this principle appeals to their religion and enforces all 
its dictates; where men are not religious, but have only an enlightened selfishness, 
it invokes that selfishness to do good to others for the reflected benefits upon itself, 
and thus it leaves only those to pursue a different course who are morally selfish 
and intellectually blind. Hence any system of education which does violence to 
this great principle of universal benevolence, which cireumscribes itself within the 
limits of a family, a caste, a party, or a sect, is but human weakness wrestling against 
divine power, and, under whatever specious disguises it may mask itself, it is only 
mortal selfishness seeking by feigned and counterfeited compliances to cajole Heaven 
out of blessings promised only to those who do unto others as they would that 
 
-P-A-G-E-49
    
EDUCATION AND CRIME. 1289 
others should do unto them. What right has any man or body of men to make the 
second table of the law of less account than the first, or to delude themselves with 
the belief that they love the Lord their God with all the heart while they do not 
love their neighbor as themselves? If God is our Father, all men must be our 
brethren. 
I believe it would not be only practicable but easy for the legislature, at its ensu- 
ing session, now so soon to be commenced, to initiate a series of measures which 
in a very brief period would carry us through the earlier stages of the contemplated 
reform, measures which would command the ready assent of a vast majority of the 
citizens of Massachusetts and would thus leave but few of those unnatural cases—of 
those parents who are not parents—to be dealt with compulsively. 
In concluding this report I shall not attempt to heighten the effect of the evidence 
and the argument which have been submitted by any effort to describe the bless- 
edness of that state of society which the universal application of this reformatory 
agency would usher in. Such an endeavor would be vain. He who would do this 
must first behold the scenes and be thrilled by the joys he would delineate; he 
must borrow the language of the Paradise he would describe, and more than this 
he must be able to depict the depth and fierceness of the pains which have been 
inflicted by the crimes of mankind, not only upon the guilty perpetrators themselves, 
but upon the innocent circles of their families and friends; the terrors of the con- 
science-stricken malefactor; the sorrow and shame of children bemoaning a parent’s 
guilt; the madness of the mother at the ruin of her child; the agony which brings 
down a father’s gray hairs with sorrow to the grave; the pangs of fraternal and sis- 
terly affection, to which a stain upon a brother’s or a sister’s name is a dark spot 
upon the sun of life, which spreads and deepens until it eclipses all the light of exist- 
ence; all the varied cries of this mingled wail of distress, which have been heard in 
all lands and at all times from the death of Abel to the present hour; all these he 
must have power to describe who would describe the blessedness of a deliverance 
from them. 
There is one consideration, however, which I can not forbear to introduce, because 
it appeals alike to all those various and oftentimes conflicting classes of men who 
are endeavoring in so many different ways to ameliorate the condition of mankind. 
Will not a moment’s reflection convince them all that, so far as human instrumen- 
tality is concerned, education encompasses, pervades, and oyverrules all their efforts, 
grants them whatever triumphs they may achieve, and sets bounds to their successes 
which they can not overpass? Why does the advocate of temperance, every time he 
returns upon his circuit of beneficence, find his way again blocked up with the pros- 
trate victims of inebriation? Why so long, in both hemispheres, have the divinest 
appeals of the advocate of peace been drowned by the din of mustering squadrons 
and the clarion of war? Why does the opponent of slavery, before he can strike the 
fetters even from one victim, see other fetters riveted upon the limbs of many more? 
Why do our moral-reform societies and our home-mission societies call annually for 
more money and more laborers wherewith to enter the ever-enlarging fields, as they 
open before them, of licentiousness and of irreligion? Why do those rich and pow- 
erful associations, formed for evangelizing the heathen world, see the very ships 
which carry out the gospel and its heralds, freighted also with idols made in Chris- 
tian lands for those heathen to buy and to worship as true gods; and laden with a 
liquid poison, too, which sinks its victims to such a depth of debasement as to make 
common heathenism enviable? Why is it that the political parties into which our 
country is divided persist, year after year, in solemnly and unceasingly charging each 
other with heinous and premeditated offenses against the fundamental principles of 
our Government and the highest welfare of our people—charges which, if true, must 
brand the accused with infamy; if untrue, the accusers? So far as the members of 
 
-P-A-G-E-50
    1290 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
any one of these various parties are loyers of truth, of righteousness, and of peace, 
let them be asked what is the reason why they accomplish so little, and why so much 
ever remains to be done, and they will answer, and answer truly, that they do not 
fail through lack of reason or of authority, but because of blindness of mind or per- 
yersity of heart in those whom they address. The admonitions of history, the pre- 
cepts of the gospel, the attributes of the Deity, are all on their side; but they are not 
heard, because they speak to adders’ ears; they are not felt, because their words of 
fire fall upon stony hearts. It is not, therefore, better or more arguments that they 
need, but men capable of appreciating argument. Their eloquence is sufficiently 
electric and powerful were it not for the flintiness of the hearts that glance off its 
lightnings. They want men whose intellects are not blind to the most radiant truths; 
whose consciences are not as the nether millstone; whose prejudices have not become 
fossilized. The merits of the divinest cause may be all canceled by the demerits of 
the hearers, as the innocence of Christ was no better than guilt at the unholy tri- 
bunal of Pilate. 
But in universal education every ‘‘follower of God and friend of human kind’’ 
will find the only sure means of carrying forward that particular reform to which he 
is devoted. In whatever department of philanthropy he may be engaged he will 
find that department to be only a segment of the great circle of beneficence of which 
universal education is center and circumference, and that it is only when these seg- 
ments are fitly joined together that the wheel of progress can move harmoniously 
and resistlessly onward. Whether, therefore, he is struggling, on the one hand, to 
emancipate society from the thraldom of some particular enormity, which to him 
seems more flagitious than all the rest, or whether, on the other hand, he is striving 
to endue his age with some special virtue, in no way can he pursue his own peculiar 
aim so directly and so speedily as by preparing a generation of men, ninety-nine in 
every hundred of whom—eyen of the first subjects submitted to the experiment— 
shall be trained ‘‘to do justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with God.” And 
however a portion of my fellow-mortals or I myself may feel in regard to the highest 
religious concernments of the soul, I trust there are none who believe that such an 
education as is here contemplated would be an obstacle, and not an aid, to the recep- 
tion of divine truth. I trust there are none who would not readily adopt the lan- 
guage of Mr. Page, in his letter above cited, where he says: ‘‘I am fully of the opinion 
that the right of. expectation of a religious character would be increased very much 
jn proportion to the excellence of the training given, since God never ordains means 
which He does not intend to bless.”” . 
THE RELATION BETWEEN CRIME AND EDUCATION.! 
By Epwarp D, Mansrienp, LL. D. 
* * * The general fact is apparent that education is a force restraining vice and 
crime. Where it is purely intellectual it restrains by teaching the truth expressed 
in the homely proyerb that ‘honesty is the best policy;’”? where it rises to the 
dignity of a Christian education it teaches not only the restraint of the intellect, but 
the higher restraint of the conscience. In either case it is a restraining force, a moral 
power, over the appetites and passions of men. 
Such being the general fact, we shall endeavor to demonstrate it by the statistics 
both of Europe and America, the latter being derived directly from the prisons, jails, 
and reformatories of the several States.

  EDUCATION AND CRIME. 1291 
THE RELATION OF CRIME TO EDUCATION IN EUROPE, 
For the power to exhibit this subject as regards Europe we are indebted to Dr. E. C. 
Wines, who, as commissioner of the United States Government to organize the Inter- 
national Prison Congress, propounded a series of questions while traveling in Europe 
during 1871. Many of the reports were made under the direct supervision of the 
Government, and the figures may be taken as thoroughly reliable. We shall use here 
only the totals, disregarding minor details. In this way we shall present the relation 
of crime to education in Europe in the most striking view. 
FRANCE, 
Of this country, Malte Brun, the scientific geographer, begins his account thus: ‘‘ The 
influence of France may be compared to that which ancient Greece possessed over 
the civilized world. The French language has become the language of courts and 
embassadors; the literature of the same people has been admired by the enlightened. 
of every nation. The inference of the reader from this declaration must be that the 
French are really an educated people, and producing the highest results of education 
in the fruits of humanity and civilization. But if this were said of what is really the 
nation, that is, of a great mass of the people, it would be entirely untrue, and furnish 
a signal proof of the superficial manner in which history is written.”’ 
In another part of his work Malte Brun (quoting the tables of Balbi) shows the 
number of scholars (pupils in school) to be 1 in 23 of the population. The number 
of children and youth in the public schools of Ohio is rather more than 1 in 4 of the 
whole population. The number in the schools of France was at that time (1832) only 
one-sixth the number in proportion to the State of Ohio, or, in other words, of the 
number that ought to be in school in order to educate the whole people. This is 
corroborated by another statement, that in 1833 out of 38,000 French communities 
14,000 were without any schools! In the meantime great efforts were made to 
increase popular education; but in 1870 there were still 800 communities totally with- 
out schools. 
It is said there are now 5,000, 000 children attending school, but as the population 
of France is now 37,000,000, even all that are now claimed to be in school is only 1 
in 7.4—that is to say, only about one-half of what would be if the whole people were 
educated. 
In 1856 there were only 63,000 primary schools, which at the usual proportion of 
pupils would give about 4,500,000 pupils, which corresponds with what has been 
stated, allowing for the increase of 1,200,000 since 1856, as stated by the French 
Government. 
Looking then to the facts above given, that in 1832 only one-sixth of the French 
people were educated at all; that in 1856 less than one-half were educated, and that 
in 1870 only a half, we shall be within bounds when we say that in 1870 more than 
half the French nation were not educated at all. Now let us look at the number and 
proportion of crimes committed in such a population. Let us take such general facts 
as we haye, without reference to details. 
Malte Brun gives the average number of births annually at about 900,000, of which 
74,000 were illegitimate. This is over 8 per cent of the whole. If we were to go into 
any neighborhood we should find each thirteenth child illegitimate. This shows how 
far ignorance has depraved the morals of the lower classes of the people. But as late 
as the past year (1871) it is stated in the papers that there had heen 4,500 suicides in 
the city of Paris, which is two hundred fold the proportion which is found in the State 
of Ohio. If we suppose this to be exaggerated, or as a consequence of the recent war, 
there will be enough of this tremendous fact remaining to show how the want of the 
restraining force of education (especially of moral education) affects the very life of 
society. 
 
-P-A-G-E-52
    1292 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
Let us now proceed to trace the effect of this great ignorance in France on the 
number and character of crimes. The record is the most startling and convincing of 
anything we have seen in the annals of statistics. Dr. E.C, Wines gives this state- 
ment, derived from the best authorities: 
Whole number of persons under arrest from 1867 to 1869. 
Number unable to read 444, 133 
442, 194         
     
      Ore: per cent.. 95. 63 
Ayerage number of convicts from 1866 to 1868. 18, 643 
Number unable to read -- 16,015 
--percent.. 87.28 
Average number of juvenile prisoners from 1866 to 1868 8, 139 
Number unable to read -- 6, 607 
    per cent.. 81.14 
We have shown above that at least half of the French people is in a state of total 
ignorance. Let us assume it as just half. At that time France had, in round numbers, 
36,000,000 of people. Then we find these proportions, viz: 
In 18,000,000 of people ‘‘ unable to read and write” there were 442,194 arrests; that 
is, 1 in 41. 
In 18,000,000 of people who were commonly educated there were 1,939 arrests; that 
is, 1 in 9,291. 
Thus proving the proportion of criminals in the uneducated classes to be two 
hundred and twenty-six times as great as that of the educated classes: 
The reader may say, ‘‘This is an exaggerated case, and, while the facts are appar- 
ently true, this proportion will not hold good in other countries.”’ 
We shall show in the sequence that the same general principle is true, and that 
when the people of the different countries are more and more educated, then this 
proportion diminishes, until, if we could imagine such a thing, society would present 
itself on the one hand thoroughly educated, and on the other hand without crime 
and without reproach. 
ENGLAND. 
Our mother country is,in every just sense of the word, England. We therefore 
look with curious interest to the condition of her education, and its influence upon 
the production or the cure of crime. Let us look at the facts. 
Dr. Wines gives the following figures:

From the above we find that the proportion of criminals totally ignorant varies in 
different countries of Europe from 35 to 95 per cent; but this does not show the 
whole truth, for in the reports from prisons in the United States it is almost uni- 
‘versally said that but few of the whole number have anything more than the lowest 
kind of education, and doubtless this is true of Europe. These statistics prove that 
in Europe ignorance among criminals is the rule and education the exception. 
Let us now examine this question more minutely in regard to our own country. 
THE RELATION OF CRIME TO EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES. 
Mr. F. B. Sanborne, of Massachusetts, in a report prepared for the International 
Prison Congress, has made some general remarks upon the statistics of American 
prisoners which are very correct. He says: 
The general condition of American prisoners, in point of education, is low, yet they 
are not so extremely illiterate as criminals are in many countries, if we except the 
colored criminals of the South. 
In Massachusetts, for a period of eight years past, the statistics show very nearly 
one-third of all prisoners to be wholly illiterate; yet, in the highest prison, at 
Charlestown, the proportion of illiterate convicts since the beginning of 1864 has 
been scarcely more than 1 in 10. 
What Mr. Sanborne has remarked of Massachusetts is in the main true of the 
whole United States, as will be seen from the numerous tables hereto annexed. 
In the great aggregate of criminals the number of the totally illiterate is very large, 
but is by no means so large as in Europe, for the reason that no part of our country 
is so densely ignorant as many parts of Europe. So, also, on the other hand, there 
are some prisons where the number of the illiterate is small, because they are special 
prisons of cities, where the better educated criminals are apt to be confined. But 
we need not remark upon these facts till we exhibit the great mass of prison statistics 
we have gathered from the Middle and Western States. 
The statements following give partial returns from seventeen States, all of them 
but three from the Middle and Western States. The aggregates, in regard to educa- 
tion, sum up as follows, viz:

Aggregate of those who can read only 5, 931 
Aggregate of those who have no education.._......-..----.+-----2--2-6-- 21, 650 
The discrepancies between the general aggregates and those for color and nativity 
are caused by the fact that in some prisons no record was kept of sex, color, or 
ahVitye eee eo 
In regard to the above aggregate facts it may be observed— 
1. That the whole number of those who can ‘‘read only” is described in the 
reports as in fact ‘‘very ignorant.’? To have learned to spell out words and read a 
little gives no real knowledge.
-P-A-G-E-54
  1294 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
2. That the prison reports almost uniformly speak of the great number of those 
who “‘cati read and write”’ as very deficient in education. 
The general conclusion is that the great mass of prisoners is yery ignorant; but in 
~ order to see this more clearly and understand it more thoroughly we shall analyze 
in the sequel the special reports of the prisons. In the meanwhile the general con- 
clusions of the aggregates above, including the observations of the prison keepers, 
are as follows: 
Per cent. 
The totally ignorant, as shown by those having no education, are 
The totally ignorant and very ignorant 
The very deficient, including these and a large share of those who can read and

- These proportions are, in regard to the ignorant, much below those of Europe; 
and they ought to be, for it is beyond all doubt that, except the negroes of the South, 
the mass of the people of the United States is much better educated than in Europe. 
This is espezially the case in New England, New York, and the central States of the 
Northwest, But in either case the general fact is shown, beyond doubt or contro- 
versy, that ignorance is one great cause of crime, and that in elevating the education 
of society, both religious and intellectual, we advance the interests of society by 
diminishing crime. 
Just so far, therefore, as society neglects to educate the people, just so far does it 
prepare the crime which the criminal commits. 
Let us now examine our statistics in detail, with regard to color, nativity, and reli- 
gious education. 
In regard to sections of the country, taking the State prisons and jails of New York 
and Pennsylvania (deducting the metropolitan police reports) as representatives of 
the Middle States, we have these results, viz:

state of education, and were otherwise defective. In the 2,400 returned, the following 
are the proportions of educated and uneducated, viz: Per cent, 
Totally ignorant .....- : 60 
Very deficient, fully -. é 85 
Thus we see that in the midst of the South, where ae colored pagulsAns is almost 
totally ignorant, we have the first approach in the United States to the educational 
condition of France in 1832, and of much of Europe now. 
Comparing the several sections of the country as presented in the above tables, and 
including those who can read only (and that is usually very little) among the totally 
ignorant, we have these proportions. Those called ‘‘very deficient”’ are a low esti- 
mate, made from uniyersal testimony of prisonkeepers:

The returns from the ‘‘ West and Pacific’’ are deficient, and therefore not a fair 
test. This, and the fact that the great body of miners are really intelligent men, 
make the reasons why that section seems to have less ignorance among criminals.

THE PROPORTION OF ILLITERATE CRIMINALS AND OF ILLITERATE POPULATION COMPARED. 
Here we come to test facts in regard to the influence of ignorance in producing 
crime. If the proportion of ignorant criminals to the whole number should prove 
greatly above that of the illiterate to the whole population, it will be a fact conclusive 
that ignorance is one great cause of crime. Fortunately the returns of education and 
illiteracy embodied in the census of 1870 will enable us to examine this question and 
obtain reliable results. 
Taking the returns of the census of 1870 in connection with the tables we have 
above given, we have the proportions below, premising, however, that, as all prison- 
ers are above 10 years of age, so we have taken from the ‘‘illiterate’’ in the census 
only those above 10 years of age.

It appears, therefore, that in the Middle States the proportion of illiterate criminals 
is eightfold the proportion of illiterate people; in the Central West it is thirteenfold; 
and in the West and Pacific States it is tenfold. In the South it is only threefold; 
but this is caused by the great mass of colored people, who make up a large portion 
of the whole people, and, being nine-tenths of them wholly ignorant, furnish the 
great mass of criminals. When the still larger white population is counted in it 
makes the disproportion of the illiterate criminals less. As to colored people only it 
is very great. But we see in the above proportions the great fact that ignorance is 
one of the great causes of crime. * * * 
Having thus established certain general principles by the incontrovertible testimony 
of statistics, it will not be inconsequential or uninteresting to give the testimony of 
some of those who-are engaged in the actual management of prisons. 
The following statement, made by the superintendent of the Detroit House of 
Correction, gives the general facts and causes of crime nearly as correctly as can be 
obtained from the general averages of the most extended table of statistics: 
Of the 8,744 prisoners, 44 per cent were under 30 years of age; 65 per cent acknowl- 
edged themselves habitually intemperate; 65 per cent were living out of the famil 
relation; only 57 per cent claimed to be able to read and write; 43 per cent acknowl- 
edging themselves without any education at all. The whole 8,744, almost without 
exception, were poor and generally penniless on their admission to the institution. 
This fact, so generally true of criminals, must bear relation to their criminality. The 
improvidence that makes the spendthrift and pauper produces also the sensuality and 
selfishness that seek the means of indulgence without self-denial or regard for con- 
sequences. 
Professor Tarbell, who has the school in the Detroit House of Correction, says: 
Of the 150 men who have been examined individually on entering the school dur- 
ing the past six months, 23 were entirely ignorant of reading; 30 could read a little, 
but not well enough to use text books; while 97 could read with tolerable readiness, 
and some of them with intelligence and expression. From this it appears that 35 
per cent of those admitted were practically illiterate. In 1869 there were 29 per cent 
of this class, and in 1870, 33 percent. Whether this apparently increasing illiteracy 
on the part of those admitted to the house of correction be due to the demoralizing 
effect of the late war on many men of intelligence, and that we are now returning to 
the more usual state of society in which the vicious are the ignorant, I will not say.
-P-A-G-E-57
  EDUCATION AND CRIME. 129% 
If the censuses of 1850, 1860, and 1870 be compared, would not the whole country 
show the same result in regard to illiterates; and can any other result be obtained 
without compulsory education? 
Mr. Cummings, the moral instructor of the California State prison, says: 
A great majority of the prisoners on their commitment are illiterate; others have 
acquired merely the elements of knowledge, without being able to turn their slight 
educational acquirements to any practical use; while the number who have acquired 
a systematic or liberal education is so extremely limited that it has been found diffi- 
cult to supply the classes with suitable teachers. Hence, when these unfortunate 
men have been approached in a kind and conciliatory spirit, very few have failed to 
respond in a similar spirit; and when the means of instruction have been provided 
for them they have eagerly availed themselves of the privileges of the prison school. 
The progress that many haye made in their studies has been truly gratifying, and. 
has demonstrated not only the practicability, but the great importance, of furnishing. 
educational facilities to prisoners. 
The fact that most of those who say they can read and write are ‘‘ not able to turn 
their slight educational requirements to any practical use’’ is a fact which mere sta-- 
tistics do not show,. but which the warden or chaplain at once discovers; and that, 
fact is simply, that nine-tenths of prisoners haye literally no useful education. Mr. 
Cummings further says: 
The educational acquirements of prisoners here do not differ materially from a 
general statement that would apply to most prisons in other States. Of 478 prison- 
ers committed from April 11, 1870, to July 1, 1871, 232 were entirely illiterate; 95 
could read and write; 120 could read and write very imperfectly, while but 31 were- 
liberally educated. 4 
Those who could read and write ‘‘very imperfectly’? may without error be put 
down as uneducated. So that, practically, four-fifths of all the California State. 
prisoners were uneducated; and yet this fact does not half appear in the table of 
statistics. 
The board of inspectors of the State penitentiary of Tennessee say: 
One out of every 25 of the entire population of Great Britain is a juvenile delin-- 
quent—a destitute vagabond, abandoned, and, in many cases, a law-breaking child 
before the age of 17. While the same proportion of such a class can not be supposed. 
to exist in this State, still the number is very large, and augmented daily with our 
increasing population. While no section of the State is entirely free from their pres~ , 
ence, our larger cities swarm with them. They are found at every corner, and in 
eyery alley; at the doors of the saloon and the theater; at our depots and wharves; 
here their faces greet you with features pinched by their necessities into expression. 
of premature shrewdness, bordering on villainy, totally foreign to the faces of well- 
cared-for childhood. From the teeming crop of ignorant, neglected, and criminal 
children is produced the large majority, if not all, of the thieves, counterfeiters, 
forgers, burglars, robbers, and murderers who fill our penitentiaries; as also those- 
subjects for seduction, and consequent prostitution, who fill the brothels of our cities. 
Here is society preparing the crime which the criminal commits. Here is the 
negative preparation of noneducation, and the positive one of temptation. 
Mr. Darnell, keeper of the Georgia penitentiary, says: 
Of all reformatory agencies religion is first in importance because most potent in. 
its action on the human heart and life. Education is also one of the vital powers in 
the reformation of fallen men and women, who have generally sinned through the 
influences of some form of ignorance conjoined with vice. Its tendency is to quicken. 
the intellect, expel old thoughts, give new ideas, supply material for meditation, 
inspire self-respect, support pride of character, excite to higher aims, open fresh 
fields of exertion, minister to social and personal improvement, and afford a healthful 
substitute for low and vicious amusements. 
It is, therefore, a matter of primary importance in the prevention of crime and the- 
improvement of society, as well as the avoiding of that combat between crime and. 
Jaw which, in this country, has been the bane of our prosperity. 
We need not cite any further testimony of this kind; this is in substance the testi- 
mony of all the keepers and officers of penitentiaries, prisons, jails, and reformato~

ries in the country. It is. the testimony of human experience on one of the most 
important points which concern human society. The evidence upon the intimate 
relation of crime and ignorance is clear, complete, and ample. It may be comprised 
in two general propositions: 
First. That one-third of all criminals are totally uneducated, and that four-fifths 
are practically uneducated. 
Secondly. That the proportion of criminals from the illiterate classes is at least ten- 
fold as great as the proportion from those haying some education. 
If these proportions are true (and we have made rather an underestimate), then, 
after making due allowance for crimes. committed with passion, without regard to 
education, and crimes, such as forgery, frauds, ete., which require some education, 
we must come to the conclusion that two-thirds of crimes might be avoided by edu- 
cation, but more especially by religious training. Against this fact some one will 
reply that so, also, a large number of criminals are intemperate, and, therefore, we 
may attribute to intemperance a large number of the crimes we now attribute to 
ignorance. True, if these were parallel causes, but they are not. In the first place a 
large number of the intemperate are such from want of education, and especially 
from want of moral and religious training. We see a great many educated persons 
(that is, commonly educated) who are intemperate, but they seldom commit crime. 
Secondly, many of those committed to prison have become intemperate on account 
of previous criminal and vicious habits. But we shail not discuss this topic, except 
so far as to present some statistics both upon intemperance and upon color. 
We give the following examples of the traits of prisoners in regard to temperance 
and intemperance, in some of the principal prisons, viz:

This proportion is rather larger than that which the statistics show as the totally 
ignorant, but not nearly so large as the very ignorant are reported to. be by the 
keepers of penitentiaries, prisons, and jails. 
Probably if we had the statistics of every prison and jail in the United States the 
result would not be materially different from what we have given above. Let us 
now look a little at the proportions of the colored people in relation to crime and 
ignorance, remembering their long enslavement and the prohibition of letters to:

The above does not contain the population of all the States in those sections, nor 
by any means all the prisoners, but it does show the proportions of white and colored 
people, and the proportions of white and colored prisoners; and this is the only pur- 
pose for which we have prepared this table. 
In New York and Pennsylvania the proportion of colored population to colored 
prisoners is 80 to 1; but of white population to white prisoners it is 700 to 1. 
In the central Northwest the proportion of colored population to colored prisoners 
is 90 to 1; but of white population to white prisoners, 700 to 1. 
In the West and Pacific, the proportion of colored population to colored prisoners , 
is 140 to 1; but of white population to white prisoners, it is 2,300 to 1. 
In the South, the proportion of colored population to colored prisoners, is 700-to 1; 
but of white population to white prisoners, 1,784 to 1. 
The only value attached to these proportions is to show that the negro population, 
being almost entirely ignorant, presents far the larger proportion of criminals. This 
we might anticipate, but it is one of many great facts which show that ignorance is 
really the greatest cause of crime. 
The nativity of criminals in the foregoing table is:

The foreign born in the United States are to the native population as 1 to 7. 
Hence, the foreign-born criminals are to natives. nearly in the proportion of 10 to 1, 
If, then, society suffers a large portion of its people to be ignorant; if it offers temp- 
tation to intemperance; if it neglects to encourage industry, is not the proposition of 
Quetelet most emphatically proved, that society prepares the crime which the criminal 
commits? Can we have a more serious testimony to the duties of society? * * *\ 
THE PUBLIC SCHOOL FAILURE.! 
By Ricarp GRANT WHITE. 
There is probably not one of those various social contrivances, political engines, or 
modes of common action called institutions, which are regarded as characteristic of 
the United States, if not peculiar to them, in which the people of this country have 
placed more confidence or felt greater pride than its public school system. There is 
not one of them so unworthy of either confidence or pride; not one which has failed 
so completely to accomplish the end for which it was established. And the case is 
worse than that of mere failure, for the result has been deplorable and threatens to 
be disastrous. = 
To those who have not thought upon this subject, or who have thought upon it 
vaguely and without careful and considerate observation of all the facts which bear 
upon it, this assertion will savor strongly of temerity and folly. The belief that edu- 
cation—meaning thereby the acquiring of such knowledge as can be got in schools 
and from books—is in itself elevating and purifying, and is the most potent agency 
in the formation of good men and good ¢itizens, is so general and so plausible that it 
has been assumed as an axiom in that which for reasons that do not yet quite clearly 
appear has come to: be called ‘‘ social science.’’ If this assumed axiom were well 
founded, if it were really true that book learning and thrift, deceney of life, and good 
citizenship are so dircetly connected that they must always be found together, it 
need hardly be said that this sort of education would be of the first necessity in every 
wisely constructed and well-ordered society, and would be of supreme necessity in a

country in which every man who lives outside of prison walls has a voice in the goy- 
ernment. Hence, the assumption on this point being what it is and has been for 
many generations, it would be strange indeed if public education had not been a sub- 
ject of grave consideration early in the short history of the United States and if it 
had not been amply provided for by legislation. The provision was early made, and 
public education at public cost has been so general here and has been developed into 
a system so vast and so complete that a better opportunity for testing its worth could 
not be hoped for. The conditions, too, under which this system has been in opera- 
tion are singularly favorable. The wealth of the country, its vast expanse of uncul- 
tivated, unoccupied land, a homestead in which can be acquired at an almost nomi- 
nal price, the general intelligence of the people, their freedom from burdensome 
taxation, the absence of privileged classes and of an established religion supported 
by the State make its people one upon which education, according to the assumed. 
theory, should have the happiest, the most benign effects; but however great may be 
the intrinsic value of education as a formative social agency, the effect of that which 
is afforded by our public school system has proved in every way unsatisfactory, and 
worse than unsatisfactory. 
That the system is of New England origin need hardly be said. It is a develop- 
ment of the New England common school, from which it has been gradually evolved 
under gradually accumulating influences, some of which were pure and philanthropic, 
but other some of which were corrupt and self-seeking. The former may be called 
social, the latter political, using the word in that narrow and derogatory sense which 
it has unhappily acquired in our discussions of public affairs. In Massachusetts, in 
the year 1647, and in Connecticut only three years later, it was enacted that every 
township of 50 householders should appoint a person within their town to teach all 
children that should resort to him to write and read, whose wages should be paid 
by either the parents or the masters of such children, or by the inhabitants in gen- 
eral; and it was also ordered that in every town of 100 families there should be a 
grammar school set up, the masters of which should be able to fit youths for the 
university, a grammar school being then a school for instruction in the Latin lan- 
guage, English grammar and the teaching of it to English-speaking children remain- 
ing yet unimagined and to men of that time almost unimaginable. This system of 
compulsory support of common schools and grammar schools spread itself over all 
New England and throughout those Northern.and Western States which were more 
or Jess under New England influence. 
The history of public education in the city of New York is of such importance as 
to merit special although brief consideration. The act establishing common schools 
in the State of New York was passed in 1812. Before that time money was expended 
by the State for the encouragement and support of schools, but there was no public 
school system. The law of 1812 applied to towns and villages, but not to chartered 
cities, with two or three specified exceptions. New York was not one of these. 
Public education in that city was in the hands of the Public School Society, a volun- 
tary association, chartered, and in its standing and motives something like the New 
York City Hospital. I have not been able, in the time that I could give to this sub- 
ject, to find the act incorporating this benevolent society, but I find so early as the 
year 1807 an act for its benefit, of which the preamble is as follows: 
Whereas the trustees of the Society for Establishing a Free School in the City of 
New York, for the education of such poor children as do not belong to or are not 
provided for by any religious society, have by their memorial solicited the aid of the 
legislature; and whereas their plan of extending the benefits of education to poor 
children, and the excellent mode of instruction adopted by them, are largely desery- 
ing the encouragement of Government; therefore, ete. 
This makes the original purpose of common school education in the city of New 
York sufficiently clear. It was intended for poor children whose education was not 
°  
-P-A-G-E-61
EDUCATION AND ORIME. 1301 
provided for by any religious society; but, in fact, its benefits were gradually 
extended to others—children not at all dependent upon charity. The character, 
the spirit, and the purpose of the society remained, however, unchanged. It sought 
to give elementary instruction and moral training to children who would otherwise 
have been more or less neglected in these respects. The benefits of a corresponding 
plan of education were conferred upon the people of the State at large by the law of 
1812, which established a common school system of a somewhat rudimentary nature; 
but the city of New York remained without provision by law for public education 
until the year 1842, when the legislature passed an act extending to the city a par- 
ticipation in the system which prevailed in the State. But the act not only did this; 
it placed the schools of the Public School Society, with those of the orphan asylum, 
of the Roman Catholic Orphan Asylum, and of several other benevolent societies, 
under the jurisdiction and supervision of the board of education. Finding them- 
selves in this position, the corporators of the Public School Society transferred their 
schoolhouses and all their other property, with their rights, to the board of educa- 
tion, and the society ceased to exist. It was not long before other school societies 
followed their example. This event was a public calamity—a calamity not only to 
the city of New York, but to the State; not only to the State, but to the whole 
country. Nor has the blight of its effect upon morals, upon politics, and upon edu- 
cation been confined to the country in which it first was felt. At that time our 
present public school system may be properly said to have begun its rapid forma- 
tion. From that time public education passed rapidly into municipal politics, and 
became an engine at once of political corruption and social deterioration. The 
example of New York was widely followed, actually if not avowedly. On all sides 
there was a cry for higher education, and as higher education meant more teachers 
to be appointed and paid, more schoolhouses to be built, more text-books to be 
bought by the tens of thousands, and, in brief, more money to be expended, the 
local politicians, who with anthropomorphic devotion worshipped their own glorified 
and gigantic likeness in the Hon. William Tweed, did all in their power—and their 
power was great—to foster the higher education. Admirable, farseeing, large- 
minded, philanthropic statesmen! They fostered the higher education until, as I 
was told about ten years ago by a publisher of schoolbooks, there was no depart- 
ment of his trade so profitable as that in which he was chiefly interested, but that 
to “‘introduce’”’ a set of two or three text-books into public school use cost between 
fifty thousand and one hundred thousand dollars (for what, pray let us know, oh, 
philanthropic dispensers of the healing light of education?) ; and until now there is 
a College of the City of New York, as a part of its common school system, and a 
normal school, at which 1,500 young women are instructed yearly in the mysteries 
of teaching, which but a very few of the 1,500 practice, mean to practice, or have 
the opportunity to practice, and until the sum of $3,805,000 is spent upon public 
education by the city of New York alone, of which sum no less than $1,009,207 is 
paid to teachers of primary departments. 
And such, in a great measure, has the ‘‘American’”’ system of public education 
become in all the country lying north of the Potomac and the Ohio. 
Nearly $4,000,000 taken in one year from the pockets of taxpayers of one city for 
education—more than $1,000,000 paid to teachers of primary schools, and a sim- 
ilar expenditure throughout the State and in more than half the States, and what 
is the result? According to independent and competent evidence from all quarters, 
the mass of the pupils of these public schools are unable to read intelligently, to spell 
correctly, to write legibly, to describe understandingly the geography of their own 
country, or to do anything that reasonably well-educated children should do with 
ease. They can not write a simple letter; they can not do readily and with quick 
comprehension a simple ‘‘sum”’ in practical arithmetic; they can not te!l the mean- 
ing of any but the commonest of the words that they read and spell so ill. There 
   
-P-A-G-E-62

should not be need to say that many of them—many in actual numbers—can do all 
these things fairly well; but these many are few indeed in proportion to the millions 
who receive a public school education. They can give rules glibly; they can recite 
from. memory; they haye some dry, disjointed knowledge of various ologies and 
osophies; they can, some of them, read a little French or German with a very bad 
accent; but as to such elementary education as is alike the foundation of all real 
higher education and the sine qua non of successful life in this age, they are, most of 
them, in almost as helpless and barren a condition of mind as if they had never 
crossed the threshold of a schoolhouse. 
The testimony to this amazing and deplorable condition of the mass of the pupils 
of our public schools is so varied, so independgnt, and comes from so many quarters 
that it must be true; it can not. be disregarded. It is given by private persons, by 
officers of school districts, by teachers themselves; and it comes from all parts.of the 
country.. It can not be repeated here in detail, for it would fill half the pages that 
can be afforded to this article. But one example of it may be given which fairly 
represents the whole. Mr. George A. Walton, agent of the Massachusetts State 
board of education, in. a report on the public schools of Norfolk County, Mass., a 
county which borders upon Boston and the inhabitants of which are somewhat 
exceptional in wealth and intelligence, sets forth a condition of things which has 
thus been graphically but correctly summarized by the Chicago Times: 
The examinations were, in the first place, of the simplest and most practical char- 
acter. There was no nonsense about them. They had but one object—to see if, in 
the common schools, the children were taught. to read, write, and cipher. * 
The showing made by some of the towns was excellent, and of them we shall aaah 
presently. In the case of others, and of many others, it is evident from what Mr. 
Walton says, and still more evident from what he intimates, that the scholars of 14 
years of age did not know how to read, to write, or tocipher. They could, it.is true, 
repeat the pieces.in their school readers, and parse and spell in classes, and ratile off 
rules in grammar and arithmetic, not one word of which they understood; but if 
they were called upon to write the shortest of letters or the simplest of composi-| 
tions, or to go through the plainest of arithmetical combinations, their failure was 
complete. They a in fact, been taught what. to them were conundrums without 
end; but the idea that the teaching ‘was to be of any practical use in the lives of these 
children, when they grew to be American men and women, formed no part of the 
system, and evidently had never entered into the heads of the instructors. * 
Then, when the letters and compositions were brought in the ingenuity in bad ae 
ing seems'simply incredible. Unless the different misspellings of the word ‘‘scholar,’’ 
for instance, were given, as in this volume. they are, who would believe that they 
would be some 230 in number? Then, again, 65 different spellings are enumerated 
of the word ‘‘depot;” 108-0f the common word ‘‘whose,’’ and 58 of ‘‘which.”? Out 
of 1,122 pupils who used the adverb ‘‘too’” in the narratives, 859, or nearly 77 per 
cent of the whole, spelled the word incorrectly. Then on pages 218, 219, and 246-248 
of the report.we are given facsimile lithographs of these letters and compositions, 
showing their average excellence in certain of the towns, and anything worse it would 
be hard to conceive. Language fails to do justice to them; they only can do it to 
themselves.! 5 
This is the intellectual result of the operation of our much-yaunted ‘‘American’’ 
public school system during the last. thirty or forty years. Competent observers in 
all quarters tell the same story. In the year 1875 it was officially recorded that the 
candidates for cadetship at West Point had showna steady deterioration in thorough- 
  
YMr. Walton’s report is before me, and I am able to bear unqualified testimony to the unexagger- 
ated truthfulness of this summary setting forth of the case which he presents in great detail. T have 
quoted this passage less for convenience’ sake than that the reader might see how widely a judgment: 
against the efficiency of our public schools is beginning to be diffused. Mr. Charles Francis Adams, 
jr., in his paper on ‘The new departure in the common schools of Quincy,” says of an examination 
of those schools by competent and impartial gentlemen in 1873: “The result was deplorable. The 
schools went to pieces, * * * In other words, it appeared, as the result of eight years’ school- 
teaching, that the children, as a whole, could neither write with facility nor read fiuently.’”

ness of elementary knowledge during the then last twenty-five years. It is needless 
to waste more words in setting forth a fact equally sad, disgraceful, and undeniable. 
Nor need we look very far for information which is both corroborative and explan- 
atory of this lamentable and almost ridiculous failure of public school education, 
The system soon began to bring forth its proper fruits. The superintendent of pub- 
lic instruction in the State of New York, in the eighth annual report from his office, 
presented to the assembly in 1862, after discussing in general terms the “limited 
knowledge’”’ among a “‘large proportion”? of the teachers of ‘‘that which all teachers 
ought first to know,’’ a deficiency which had been found a ‘‘source of embarrass- 
ment,’ said: ei 
Many [teachers] who have been over a very extended ground of higher mathe- 
matics fail utterly in the simplest principles of mental and practical arithmetic. 
More have spent busy terms in the study of the classics, but have no knowledge of 
the first. principles of their own language; while to find one who knows anything of 
the geography of his own, much less of foreign lands, is rare good fortune indeed! 
And yet these are not novices, but representative teachers, as the average term of 
their experience shows (p. 39). 
We have here revealed to us the condition into which public education has been 
brought by twenty years’ experience of our public school system, a period just 
‘about long enough to mature a second generation of teachers under the influence of 
“that system. 
This being the mental condition and the educational equipment of teachers, what 
may we reasonably look for in their pupils, the time having not yet come when 
men may gather grapes of thorns or figs of thistles? Mr. Walton’s Norfolk County 
report might have been written in advance by any man gifted with moderate power 
of forecast. As a mere imparter of useful knowledge the public school system has 
failed utterly. 
And now let us consider that system in relation to the reason, the only reason 
which justifies its establishment. It is supported by encrmous sums of money taken 
by process of law from the pockets of individuals. Will he, nill he, every man who 
has property is compelled to pay for the education of other men’s children in schools 
to which he may or may not wish to send his own children, if he has any. The 
only possible justification for this forcible appropriation of his money is that it is for 
the public good, for the common wealth, that the system for the support of which 
his money is taken affords security for life, liberty, and property which without 
that system would be lacking. And this is the reason for it, and the only reason 
that is avowed. It has recently been set forth very clearly by an able and highly 
esteemed public-school officer of high position, in a passage which is a very com- 
plete expression of the raison d’étre of our public school system. The superintend- 
ent of the board of education of the city of New York (one of the most high-minded 
and capable members that board has ever had), in his report for 1879 thus remarks: 
In our day, and in the condition of American life, we need all the power of an 
educated intelligence in order to lift the masses, as well as to maintain an equilibrium. 
in the forces of society. The distribution of knowledge is as necessary as the dis- 
tribution of light. We need the distributive power of systems of education which 
will reach the lowest abodes and penetrate to the farthermost hamlets of the land. 
oe ee education of the people will thus become the best government of the people 
p. 27). 
Here we have the professed and the honestly believed social and political theory 
upon which the public school system rests. It is to lift the masses. Knowledge is 
as necessary to healthy social life as light is to healthy physical life. If education 
reaches the lowest abodes, we may then, and only then, have the best government 
of the people. ; 
The theory is not merely unsound, it is utterly and absolutely false. Knowledge 
   
-P-A-G-E-64
  1304 _ EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
will not lift the masses, except as a balloon is lifted, because it is inflated with gas. 
Mere knowledge does not raise the quality of men’s moral natures. Knowledge is 
light indeed to him who can see, and who can think and feel rightly as to what he 
sees; but mere intellectual light, without moral warmth, will not produce a healthy 
social life any more than a healthy physical life can exist in the light of a thousand 
suns without the genial warmth of one. The road to the best government of the 
people does not lie only through the door of the public schoolhouse. 
This theory itself, however, is the natural fruit of a belief which has obtained 
general acceptance, and which is embodied in an adage that, like so many adages, is 
fallacious, and yet is received without question because of its sententious form. It 
seems conclusive, and it saves people the trouble of observing and thinking. This 
adage is, ‘‘Ignorance is the mother of vice.”? Among all the hundreds of adages, 
which are supinely accepted and blindly acted upon, there is hardly one which is 
more at variance than this is with the truth. On the contrary, the teaching of the 
world’s experience through all past ages, and in the light of the present day, is this: 
Ignorance is the mother of superstition, but has no relation with vice. 
Ignorance has, indeed, a certain relation with vice—a relation which, however, 
is merely one of frequent coexistence. But coexistence does not imply connection. 
It no more implies connection than sequence does. That which follows is not nec- 
essarily the consequence of that which goes before. Post hoc does not imply prop- 
ter hoc. Equally true is it that two things found often, or even generally, together 
have not necessarily the relation of cause and effect, nor even that of identity of 
cause. Vice may, and often does, flaunt unpalliated by ignorance; ignorance may, 
and often does, walk with its humble purity untainted by vice. Some of the most 
vicious men that have ever lived have been well instructed, accomplished, and even 
learned. Some of the purest and best have been ignorant—so ignorant that they 
could read and write hardly better than the majority of the pupils of our public 
schools. Ignorance and vice are so frequently found together, not because the for- 
mer is the cause of the latter, but because both—but chiefly the former—are the 
common companions of poverty. Want, if not the parent of vice, is at least its 
faithful foster mother. One among the proverbs that. really embody the truth of 
the world’s experience is that which tells us ‘‘It is hard for an empty bag to stand 
upright.’’ Becky Sharp said that she could have been a good woman if she had 
had £5,000 a year. The goodness of the Becky Sharps of this world, under any. 
cireumstances, is but skin-deep, like their beauty; but beauty is none the less sought 
for and longed for; and so decorous behavior and decent life are all that society can 
demand, no matter what their motive. Thackeray, in this speech of his greatest 
creation, lays bare the nature of all vice. Vice is the satisfaction of personal wants 
without regard to right. Now, as the obstacle to the satisfaction of wants is almost 
always the lack of means—that is, of money or its equivalent—the result is that most 
vice is directly connected with the need of money. The fact that the need may be 
actual and healthy—as for the necessities and comforts of life, or fictitious and fan- 
ciful—as for luxuries of whatever sort, does not impair the truth of the axiom that 
need is the motive to the vicious life. Hence it is that poverty and vice are so often 
found together, and that, poverty being so common, vice isso common. There are 
thousands of humble Becky Sharps, and of their male counterparts, in every town 
and county in the country. 
If ignorance were the mother of vice, and if our public-school system were what 
itis set up to be, the fruits of the latter would by this time have been manifest, 
plainly visible to the whole world, in our moral advancement as a people, in a 
higher tone in our society, in the greater purity of our politics and the incorrupti- 
bility of our legislators, in the increased probity of the executive officers of our 
State and municipal governments and of our corporate financial bodies, in the supe- 
rior wisdom and more solid integrity of our bench, in the sobriety of our matrons,

EDUCATION AND CRIME. 1805 
the modesty of our maidens, in the greater faithfulness of wives, in the diminution 
of divorces, in the steady decrease of vice and crime and idleness and vagrancy and 
vagabondage. If ignorance be the mother of vice and the public school is the effi- 
cient foe of ignorance, the last fifty years should have seen in all these respects an 
improvement so great that admiring nations would applaud and humbly hope to 
imitate. But who needs to be told that in all these respects we have deteriorated? 
It is not Horace’s praiser of the days when he was a boy that tells us this. Itisa 
matter of public record. It is known to every observant man who has lived more 
than thirty years. Our large towns swarm with idle, vicious lads and young men 
who have no visible means of support. Our rural districts are infested with tramps— 
a creature unknown to our fathers, and eyen to us in our youth. The corruption of 
our legislative bodies is so wide and so deep and so well known that great corpora- 
tions and business men of large wealth can almost always obtain the legislation 
needful for their ends, right or wrong. Bribery at elections is almost openly prac- 
ticed by both our great political parties. The general tone and character of our 
bench, both for learning, for wisdom, and for integrity, have fallen notably during 
the last thirty years. Dishonesty in business and betrayal of trust have become so 
common that the public record of the last fifteen years on this subject is such that 
it can not be remembered without shame. Politics, instead of being purified and 
elevated, has become a trade in which success falls year by year more to inferior men 
who have a little low cunning. Divorces have multiplied until they have become 
so common as to be a stock jest in the facetious column of our newspapers. Crime 
and vice have increased year after year almost pari passu with the development of 
the public-school system, which, instead of lifting the masses, has given us in their 
place a nondescript and hybrid class, unfit for professional or mercantile life, unwill- 
ing and also unable to be farmers or artisans, so that gradually our skilled labor is 
done more by immigrant foreigners, while our native citizens, who would otherwise 
naturally fill this respectable and comfortable position in society, seek to make their 
living by their wits—honestly if they can; if not, more or less dishonestly; or, fail- 
ing thus, by petty office-seeking. Filial respect and parental love have both dimin- 
ished; and, as for the modesty of our young men, and even of our young women, 
they do not even blush that they have lost it. This is the condition in which we 
are after more than half a century of experience of our public-school system, the 
only justification for whose existence is that it was asserted and believed to bea 
panacea for the cure of social and political disease. Nor is the case of that system 
at all bettered by the quite untenable assumption that all this would have been 
without its influence; for its only justification, the very reason of its being, is the 
other assumption, that by it all this would have been prevented. 
Moreover, there is evidence on record, evidence furnished quite independently of 
any investigation of this subject, which proves the case against the public-school 
system as clearly and as undeniably as the truth of Newton’s theory of gravitation 
is proved by the calculations which enable astronomers to declare the motions and 
to weigh the substance of the planets. For the census returns show that crime, 
immorality, and insanity are greater in proportion to population in those communi- 
ties which have been long under the influence of the public-school system than they 
are in those which have been without it. The system, be it remembered, is of New 
England origin, and the Néw England States have been longest under its influence. 
The States south of the Potomac are those which were longest without it; and, 
indeed, in them it has hardly yet obtained favor or foothold. Let us compare the 
statistics of population, of literacy and illiteracy, and of crime in these two classes of 
States, carefully eliminating from our calculation the influence of foreign immigration 
upon the criminal record of the Northern States, which the particularity of the cen- 
sus returns enables us to do. The comparison is between the native white popula- 
tions of Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Vermont, Maine, and Rhode

1306 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
Island on the one hand, and the same population of Delaware, Virginia, Maryland, 
North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia on the other. These are all original 
States of the Union, Maine excepted; but Maine was always a part of New England. 
They are Commonwealths founded at about the same time by people of the same race 
and the same religion. In 1860 secession and consequent civil war caused in the 
Southern States an upturning of all the elements of society, which makes it proper 
that the examination of their social condition should be limited by the census of that 
year. 
The census of 1860 shows that the New England States had a native white popula- 
tion 2,665,945 in number, and of these there were but 8,543 adults who could not read 
and write. The six Southern States mentioned above had 3,181,969 native white 
inhabitants, among whom there were 262,802 adults who could not read and write. 
In the New England States, therefore, the native whites who could not read and 
write were in the proportion of 1 to 312, while in the six Southern States the propor- 
tion of wholly illiterate whites was 1 to 12. Now, if ignorance is the mother of vice, 
of crime, of wretchedness, and of all that goes to make bad citizens, the excess of the 
criminal classes in the Southern States should have been in something like the pro- 
portion of 312 to 12. But it was not so. On the contrary, the proportional excess 
of crime, of pauperism, of suicide, and of insanity (and among the native white 
inhabitants, be it remembered) was very much greater in the New England States; 
for in 1860 they had in their prisons 2,459 criminals, while the six Southern States 
had but 477. New England society, formed under the public-school system, pro- 
duced 1 native white criminal to every 1,084 inhabitants; while the Southern States, 
which had been almost entirely without that system, produced only 1 to every 6,670— 
a disproportion of more than 6to1!! The New England States had one publicly sup- 
ported pauper to every 178 inhabitants, while the six Southern, which were without 
public schools, had but 1 to every 345. Of suicides, there were in the New England 
States 1 to every 13,285 of the entire population; but the others had only 1 to every 
56,584. The census of 1860 has no record of insanity; but that of 1870 shows in New 
England 1 insane person of those born and living in the several States to every 800 
native-born inhabitants; but in the six Southern States in question only 1 to every 
1,682 native inhabitants. Strange to say, foremost in this sad record stand Massa- 
chusetts and Connecticut, which have had common schools since 1647 and 1650, 
respectively, as was remarked in the beginning of this article, the former producing 
1 native white criminal to every 649 native white inhabitants; the latter, 1 to 
every 845. 
The significance of these facts and figures can not be mistaken or explained away. 
Does it therefore follow that knowledge is incompatible with virtue, thrift, good 
citizenship, and happiness, and that education is per se an evil? Notatall. But it 
does follow that ignorance is not the mother of vice; that ignorance has no necessary 
connection with vice. It does follow that the public school system is not the reform- 
atory agent which it has honestly been supposed to be; that its influence is not to 
make men good, and thrifty, and happy; that it is not adapted to produce the best 
government of the people. 
In 1870 the cost of the system which coexisted with the condition of society indi- 
cated by these figures, and which has been previously eon ribed in this article, was 
more than $64,000,000. 
The remedy? A remedy must be found. It can not be set forth in detail at the 
  
1 The well-known fact that homicide is more common in the Southern States than in the Northern 
is ofno importance in the consideration of these statistics. It merely shows that to the mass of crime 
in the one case homicide bears a large proportion, and to the mass of crime in the other a very small 
one. And it is to be remarked that of the homicides in the Southern States a very large proportion, 
spriuging as they do from an antiquated perversion of the sense of honor, semisayage as they often 
are, are generally less base and vicious in motive than the comparatively few murders in the Northern,

end of an article like this, which has already exceeded the limits assigned to it. But 
it may be briefly indicated as a discontinuation of any other education at the public 
eost than that which is strictly elementary—reading, spelling, writing, and the com- 
mon rules of practical arithmetic; and in the remission of all education higher than 
this to parents, the natural guardians and earthly providence of their children. And 
those children only should be thus educated at public cost whose parents are too poor 
to give them even an elementary education themselves. Supplementary to this sim- 
ple system of elementary education, there might be some jealously guarded provision 
for the higher education of pupils who have exceptional ability and show special 
aptitude and taste for science or literature. 
Moreover, if Government is to assume a parental and formative function, and to 
attempt the making of good citizens, it may, with much more reason and propriety, 
establish public farms and public workshops, and train in them its future citizens to 
get their own living honestly and respectably, than it may establish and compel 
attendance upon schools on a system the result of which, according to the experience 
of half a century, is deterioration in purity of morals, in decency of life, in thrift, 
and in all that goes to make good citizens, accompanied by a steadily increasing 
failure in the aequirement of the very elements of useful knowledge. 
“THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM A FAILURE.’’—A REPLY TO RICHARD 
GRANT WHITE.' 
Mr. Richard Grant White says in the December number of The North American 
Review that, ‘“‘as an imparter of useful knowledge, the public school system has 
failed utterly.’’ And, again, ‘‘The case is worse than mere failure, for the result 
has been deplorable, and threatens to be disastrous.” Indeed, according to some 
statements in this remarkable article, it has already proved disastrous to the intelli- 
gence and morals of the people where public schools have existed. 
This has a rather strange sound to Northern ears. But, like many other discover- 
ies that seem new, those familiar with Shakespeare’s Henry VI will recognize it as 
what the ethnographers call a ‘‘survival.” 
So far as I know, it was Jack Cade who made the original discovery that Lord Say 
had “‘most traitorously corrupted the youth of the realm, in erecting a grammar 
school.’’? Whether Mr. White got the hint from Cade I don’t know, but there seems 
to be a marvelous resemblance in their ideas. 
Before following Mr. White through some of the details of his article, it will be 
well, perhaps, to call attention to his two leading propositions, on which the whole 
article rests. 
His first proposition is that ‘“as'an imparter of useful knowledge the public school 
system has failed utterly.” 
This proposition he proves to his own satisfaction by the aid of some detached state- 
ments in Mr. Walton’s report of examinations in Norfolk County, as well as by some 
exceptional lithographed examples of poor work contained in that report; and by 
some exaggerated statements of Mr. Charles Francis Adams, jr., which are sufficiently 
answered by an official document of the date referred to, bearing his own signature. 
Haying established, as he thinks, his first proposition, Mr. White lays down 
another, of which it can not be said that it is like unto the first. It is this: That 
“Ignorance is not the mother of vice,’ and has no connection with it, except that 
they sometimes coexist, neither of them being the cause of the other. 
And how do you suppose he undertakes to prove this? Why, by assuming that his 
first proposition is false, and that the States in which a public school system exists 
  
1A paper read before the Massachusetts Teachers’ Association, December, 1880, by B. F. Tweed.  
-P-A-G-E-68
1308 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
are more intelligent, have more knowledge, than those that have no public school 
system ; for he goes on to present such an array of statistics, manipulated to suit his 
purpose, as shows to his satisfaction that those communities which have been long 
under the infiuence of a publicschool system have more crime and immorality than 
those which have been without it. 
But, supposing it to be true (which, of course, I do not admit) that crime and 
immorality haye been more common in the States where public schools exist than 
in others, how does this prove that ‘ignorance is not the mother of vice?”’ 
He has already assured us that ‘‘as an imparter of useful knowledge the public 
school system has failed utterly.’’ Why, then, should we not presume the commu- 
nities that have not been cursed with a common school system, but where, in the 
language of Mr. White, education has been remitted to parents, ‘‘the natural guard- 
ians and earthly providence of their children’’?—I say, why should we not presume 
such communities to possess more useful knowledge than those that have had a 
school system only to find that “as an imparter of useful knowledge it has failed 
utterly?”? 
What, then, has Mr. White proved? If the first proposition, then his statistics— 
if they do not prove that ‘‘ignorance is the mother of vice’’—do prove that the 
amount of crime in a community is in direct proportion to the amount of ignorance. 
If, therefore, his first proposition is true, he has disproved the second. If his 
second is proved, it is by a direct denial of the first; for it rests entirely on the 
assumption that those communities where a public school system has existed are 
more intelligent—that is, have more knowledge. 
It reminds one of the gentleman’s servant, who cut off a favorite dog’s head to 
save the pitcher into which he had thrust it, and then broke the pitcher to get the 
dog’s head out. 
Such being the character of this article as shown in its two leading propositions, 
it may be proper to remind Mr. White that logicians have found the same difficulty 
in proving contradictories that railroad men have in trying to make two trains pass 
each other on the same track. Thus far the result has always been a damaging 
collision. 
But let us inquire a little into the nature of Mr. White’s proof. 
Mr. White quotes from a recent statement of Charles Francis Adams, jr., that 
when, in 1873, they examined the schools of Quincy, ‘‘the result was deplorable. 
They all fell through,”’ ete. 
But let us see how this statement—made in 1880—agrees with the annual reports, 
made when the facts were fresh in the mind of Mr. Adams. 
From the school report of Quincy for 1872-73, I take the following: 
The standard of education has not been notably advanced during some years, so 
far as the committee can judge. But while this is substantially true, it is also true 
that the standard has neither been lowered nor drawn back; and it is possible that 
an eagerness for exceptional excellence may have blinded us toa steady and sub- 
stantial, though slow advance. To those who can recall the situation twenty years 
since, this may appear considerable. 
Again, 
It has been said that a point has been reached in our schools which seems 
to be near the goal at which common schools aim; and this is substantially true, 
taking into consideration the age and average attendance of the pupils. 
In the report of 1873-74 I find the following: 
The school committe, in entering upon the performance of the closing duty of 
their school year, are glad to be able to congratulate the people of Quincy upon the 
satisfactory general character of the results they have to report. 
While there have been no striking alterations in the main system of management, 
no radical innovation in method of instruction, nor considerable change in the style 
of teachers, a fair, even, and well-distributed improvement has been noted in most of 
the departments of study. . 
 
-P-A-G-E-69
  EDUCATION AND CRIME. 1309 
Then, after speaking of several schools, one of which ‘‘appeared much better,’ 
another ‘‘not so well,’’ and others bearing ‘‘indications of improvement,”’ the 
report continues: 3 
But, as a rule, the committee saw nothing which léads them to modify the opinion 
expressed in their last annual report, to the effect that, as regards instruction, a 
point has been reached which is near the natural term of such force as our present 
system of schooling is calculated to exert. 
At the same time it is to be remembered that, as compared with many years ago, 
the tests applied to our schools have much increased in severity. 
The new principle of conducting the examinations introduced by the committee a 
year ago, under which a single and the same branch of the studies pursued is in the 
examinations of all the schools assigned to each member of the committee, has also 
been pursued this year. During the examinations, the schools are thus taken wholly 
out of the hands of their instructors and into those of the committee. 
Under these circumstances a mere education of ‘‘ veneering”’ is sure to reveal its 
false character. It is wholly impossible to prepare classes for a ‘“‘show-off.”’ The 
examinations, therefore, now at least reveal as a whole the real results of our school- 
ing. * * * They do not show all that we might desire they should; but they do 
show much, and what they do show is there; there is at least no parade of results 
which have no reality in existence. 
So said the two excellent reports of the Quincy schools, 1872-73 and 1873-74; both 
of which were adopted and issued by a committee, of which Mr. Charles Francis 
Adams, jr., and his brother, John Quincy Adams, were members. 
But perhaps this inconsistency in Mr. Adams’s utterances is susceptible of an 
explanation creditable to the present condition of the schools, and indicative that he 
now takes a broader view of what our philosophical friends would call the ‘‘ poten- 
tialities’’? of our schools. 
In 1873 Mr. Adams knew less of our common schools than he does now, after a 
Jong term of service on the school committee. When, therefore, in the light of the 
great improvement he has seen during the last five or six years, he looks back to the 
examination of 1873, it is no wonder he exclaims, ‘‘It was deplorable.’ He looks 
from a different standpoint. It is the old story of the two-sided shield. Mr. Adams 
had seen only the silver side then; and, like our financiers, previous to that period, 
he was content with the ‘dollar of our fathers.” Now, having seen the golden side, 
that “pale and common drudge ’tween man and man’? is not satisfactory. He is 
understood to favor the gold standard, as well in education as in finance. 
I may say also that Mr. Walton’s report, on which Mr. White relies so much for 
proof of his first proposition, as a whole, does not justify his indiscriminate condem- 
nation of the schools, even in Norfolk County. 
Any one who knows Mr. Walton knows that, while he would be the last man to 
do injustice to teachers and pupils, he is by nature and habit sufficiently critical to 
guard against any undue leniency of judgment. And the summing up of the per- 
centages obtained is considerably above what is required in our best colleges for 
graduation. 
So also the lithographs of letters and narratives by primary and grammar school 
pupils are, I do not hesitate to say, as a whole, creditable. Some are very good; 
many are creditable; some, I admit, are very poor; and I might have doubted the 
expediency or justice of circulating them without some explanation. 
What is the natural capacity of the pupil whose work is here exhibited? 
How long has he been in school? 
Has he been regular in attendance? 
If it had appeared that the poorest work was done by pupils of average capacity, 
who had been regular in their attendance during the usual school course, and the 
best work by those whose limited attendance and other circumstances had saved 
them from the demoralizing effects of the school system, I should have admitted 
that there was some force in Mr. White’s strictures. 
I should like to have some theological Mr. Walton go through a county—I care not
-P-A-G-E-70
  1810 EDUCATION. REPORT, 1898-99. 
if it be Norfolk, that the parallel may be complete—and test the knowledge and 
practice of the several congregations of that county in the rudiments of Christianity, 
marking their progress in the Christian virtues on the same scale of percentages as 
used in the schools. 
Then, if it were possible—I don’t know exactly how it could be done—I would 
have facsimiles of their knowledge of Christian principles, as it appears in their 
acts—what they do—that we might see whether “their lips and lives express the 
holy gospel they profess.”’ 
If this report should be found better than the educational report, I should say, so 
much the more creditable to the clergymen, and so much the less creditable to the 
school-teachers. 
If, however, it should prove otherwise, I should not immediately jump to the 
conclusion that Christianity is a failure. It may not have done its perfect work. 
Indeed, we know it has not. It has encountered innumerable obstacles. Like our 
school system, that perfect system of Christian morality has depended for its pro- 
mulgation on fallible men, many of whom have had no more appreciation of the 
principles of Christianity than the average school-teacher has of the principles of 
pedagogy. 
And yet, with all these drawbacks, it may have been, and I believe it has been, 
the most important factor in the world’s progress. No doubt the apostle was 
justified in speaking of the “foolishness of preaching,’’ and I will not take issue 
with anyone who speaks of the foolishness of a great deal of the teaching in our 
schools. Still, poor preaching and poor teaching have been infinitely better than 
Moles = sete 
As to the moral influence of our school system, and the ratio of crime in the two 
divisions, about which Mr. White has so much to say, it is sufficient answer to refer 
him to the able and exhaustive report of Mr. Carroll D. Wright, Chief of Bureau of 
Statistics of Labor. Had Mr. White carefully studied this report, he might have 
sayed himself the trouble of writing a considerable part of his article, and thus refut- 
ing what remained of it. 
I have only to make a few brief extracts from this report to show how utterly 
fallacious all reasoning on the census statistics must be, unaccompanied by such ex- 
planation as is contained in Mr. Wright’s report. 
General Walker, superintendent of census returns in 1870, says: 
No single measure can be taken for determining the proportion of crime in the 
several communities of our country. 
The absence of any effort to reduce to a consistent body the returns on this subject 
in the last census—that to which Mr. White refers—led to misrepresentations of 
States and sections. In some cases returns were restricted to convictions for grave 
offenses, while in others convictions for the most petty offenses were equally 
considered. 
Then follows this statement, which seems to have escaped Mr. White’s notice: 
“In the opinion of the superintendent no use of these figures for purposes of com- 
parisons between the States will be justifiable without reference to the foregoing.” 
And yet this is exactly what Mr. White has done. Is it possible that he is one of 
the victims of our public-school system? Was it in a public school that he learned 
to use the census returns in a manner which the superintendent of those returns says 
is ‘‘ unjustifiable?” 
But there are other reasons for pronouncing Mr. White’s use of these returns 
“unjustifiable.” 
Mr. Carroll D. Wright, in comparing Massachusetts and Virginia as representative 
States, shows that while the criminal code of Massachusetts in 1860 provided for 158 
offenses designated as crimes, the code of Virginia recognized but 108 such offenses 
punishable at law, and several of these, common to both States, were punishable by 
imprisonment in Massachusetts, but only by fine in Virginia.

EDUCATION AND CRIME. 1311 
Of the commitments in Massachusetts in 1860 more than half (54 per cent) were 
for offenses punishable in Virginia by fine only. 
Perhaps it may throw a little light on the value of Mr. White’s statistics to show 
the demoralizing effects of our schools, to state that the sense of different commu- 
nities as expressed in their laws differs widely. Thus, while-in Massachusetts 
adultery, fornication, and many other offenses are regarded as grave, and punishable 
by imprisonment, in Virginia they may be condoned by a fine. * * * 
But because our schools have not made all our citizens intelligent and banished 
ignorance from the State, I am not prepared to pronounce them an utter failure any 
more than I am to pronounce Christianity an utter failure because in nineteen 
centuries it has failed to bring the millennium. * * * 
COMPULSORY EDUCATION IN RELATION TO CRIME AND SOCIAL 
MORALS.! ; 
By WILLIAM T. Harris, LL, D. 
The question of compulsory education as a means of prevention of crime involves 
prior questions relating to the nature of education and its different branches or 
species. It involves likewise a consideration of the nature of crime, and of what 
constitutes a preventive agency for crime. 
If education in general does not act as a preventive of crime, it is useless to expect 
any good results from compulsory education. If some kinds of education are effect- 
ive in the prevention of crime, and others not, then the first business of practical 
importance is to ascertain what branches of education possess this utility, and in 
what features is to be found the desired virtue. 
Let us open the discussion by reference to some of the statistics bearing on the 
question of school education. In the Reportof the United States Commissioner of Edu- 
cation for 1872 there are valuable special articles on the relation of school education to 
crime, to pauperism, and to productive industry. These articles are a mine of infor- 
mation and sound reasoning on the topie we are considering. In the essay of Dr. E. 
D. Mansfield, which forms a part of the Commissioner’s Report, we have given: The 
aggregate number of prisoners in 1870 was 110,538; aggregate who could read and 
write, 82,812; aggregate number who could neither read nor write, 21,650; and of 
those who could barely read, but not write, 5,931; total illiterates 27,581, or 25 per 
cent of the entire number of prisoners. 
These returns are collected from 17 States, 14 of these being Western or Middle 
States. Considering that the mere ability to read and write implies only three or 
four months’ schooling, it is surprising to see that so many of the prisoners come 
from the very small class of the population in these 17 States that is reckoned illiter- 
ate or nearly so. 
*_ Taking the State prisons and jails of New York and Pennsylvania, showing an 
“aggregate number of 12,772 prisoners, the number totally ignorant was found to be 
19 per cent of the whole; taking the totally ignorant and the very ignorant, the 
amount was 33 per cent of the whole; adding to these the very deficient, the amount. 
was upward of 60 per cent. 
In the prisons and jails of the central Northwest, including Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, 
Michigan, and Wisconsin, returns from 30 penitentiaries, workhouses, and jails 
showed an aggregate of 18,931 prisoners. Of these, 40 per cent are classified as 
totally ignorant; 6 per cent more as very ignorant; 29 per cent more as very defi- 
cient—making a total of 75 per cent very deficient, very ignorant, or totally ignorant.

1885. 
 
-P-A-G-E-72
1812 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
Taking four State prisons in Minnesota, Iowa, Kansas, and California, of 1,957 
prisoners in the aggregate it was found that 21 per cent were totally ignorant, 10 per. 
cent more were very ignorant, and 19 per cent more very deficient, or 50 per cent 
below the standard fixed upon as the separating line for very deficient. 
Taking the States of Maryland, Kentucky, and South Carolina, 2,400 prisoners (a 
majority colored) were classified as 60 per cent totally ignorant and 25 per cent more 
as very deficient, or 85 per cent as at least very deficient in school education. 
Turning from these statistics to the census returns for 1870, we take next the ratio 
of illiteracy in the entire population, and compare it with the ratio of illiterate crim- 
inals. In New York and Pennsylvania, we sce that, while the illiterate in the entire 
population amount to only 4 per cent—the illiterate prisoners amount to 33 per cent 
of all the prisoners, and the very deficient includes 60 per cent of them. 
In other words, the 4 per cent of the entire population that is illiterate furnish 33 per 
cent of the criminals—twelve times as many criminals from the illiterate as from an 
equal number who were not illiterate. The ratio is found thus: Four per cent of the 
entire population are illiterate, and 96 per cent not illiterate. The 4 per cent illiterate 
furnish 33 per cent of the criminals, which is more than eight times the quota that they 
should furnish if education made no difference in this matter. The 96 per cent not 
illiterate furnish only 67 per cent of the criminals, i.e., about two-thirds of their 
quota. Hence, in this capacity for furnishing criminals, the illiterate surpass the not 
illiterate in the ratio of eight to two-thirds, and thus in fact furnish twelve times as 
many criminals as an equal number of not illiterates do. 
In the central West, 33 per cent of the population is returned as illiterate, and 46 
per cent of the criminals illiterate. Hence the illiterates furnish thirteen times 
their share of the criminals. In the far West and the Pacific section, the returns 
give 3 per cent illiterate as furnishing 31 per cent of the criminals, or tenfold their 
quota. In the three Southern States, 22 per cent illiterate furnish 60 per cent of the 
criminals. In these statistics, it is shown that, of the 110,538 prisoners, 91,427 are 
whites; of the latter, 57,824 are foreign born. 
Statistics collected by Dr. E. C. Wines show that in France the number of persons 
under arrest from 1867 to 1869 was 444,133, of whom 442,194 were reported as unable 
to read, making over 95 per cent. Of the illiterates there was an average of 1 arrest 
for each 41 persons; but only 1 arrest for 9,291 persons who could read. This seems 
a too great disproportion measured by our American experience. 
Further statistics from Dr. Wines show, in England, out of 157,223 committals to 
county or borough prisons, 53,265 illiterate, or 34 per cent; in Switzerland the aver- 
age of criminals unable to read, through all prisons, 83 per cent. 
These facts go to prove that even a slight degree of school education has an effect 
to lessen the tendency toward crime. It is to be remarked that statistics are to be 
used with caution, inasmuch as each quantitative result conceals within it an infini- 
tude of qualitative factors which may possibly assist in the product. Were it pos- 
sible to eliminate all the qualitative factors but one, the numerical statement would 
be unambiguous. 
In connection with this I give some statistics taken from a recent work on indus- 
trial education. In the Philadelphia penitentiary it is said there were, in the period 
1860-1879, 1,605 prisoners. Of these, 490 were illiterates, making over 30 per cent of 
illiterates. In the same penitentiary for this decade there were 1,217 that had never 
been apprenticed to any trade, or 76 per cent of the total number. 
Without further consideration it might seem that the ratio of criminals from those 
who can read and write is two and one-half times as large as from those who have 
been apprenticed toa trade. But the illiterates over 10 years of age for Pennsylvania 
in 1870 were counted at less than 5 per cent of the population, while the proportion 
of the population returned as engaged in some form of productive industry is nearly 
35 per cent. Hence, it would appear that the 35 per cent of industrial population
-P-A-G-E-73
  EDUCATION AND ORIME. 13138 
furnished 24 per cent of the criminals, while the 95 per cent that could read and 
write furnished only 30 per cent of the criminals. The apprenticed furnished two- 
thirds of their quota of criminals, while the educated furnished less than one-third. 
In the decade from 1870 to 1880 it is said that out of 2,383 prisoners 706 were illit- 
erate, while only 433 had been apprenticed toa trade. It would be unfair to sup- 
pose that the word ‘“‘apprenticed”’ is taken in its ordinary meaning, for certainly not 
one in ten of the industrial population of Pennsylvania has been ‘‘apprenticed”’ in 
the old meaning of the word. It must be understood to mean those who haye been. 
taught to earn their living in some gainful occupation, whether agricultural, mechan- 
ical; mercantile, or personal. With this meaning the 433 apprenticed, or 18 per cent 
of 2,383, come from the 34 per cent of the entire population that are engaged in pro- 
ductive industry while the 706, or 30 per cent, of illiterate prisoners have come from 
the 7 per cent o° illiterates reported in the census for 1880. 
The 82 per cent of the prisoners that have not been apprenticed come from the 41 
per cent of the population returned as being over 10 years of age and not engaged in 
any gainful occupation. The unapprenticed furnish twice their quota of criminals, 
while the illiterates furnish from four to thirteen times their quotas of criminals. 
In the face of these statistics let us consider for a moment the characteristics of the 
two terms with which we are now dealing—education and crime. Crime is defined 
as breach of the laws of the State. The criminal attacks society. He injures hig 
fellow-man in person or property. He prefers the gratification of some selfish pas- 
sion or appetite to the good of his neighbor. 
Now, what is the training which develops in the child a respect for the social 
whole, a feeling that society embodies his substantial good—a feeling of preference 
for the good of his fellow-man over his own whim or caprice? 
Certainly, that training is the training which is given by bringing up the child in 
the society of others, and causing him to practice perpetually those customs which 
respect persons and property. A due sense of public opinion, a respect for the ideal 
standard of right and wrong set up in the community, is the primary requisite. 
It is clear that man can live in society and constitute a social whole only so far as 
individuals are educated out of their natural animal condition and made to respect 
social forms more highly than mere animal impulses. Hence it is clear that society 
itself rests upon education, in this broad sense of the word. 
But what has this to do with school education? Much of the education into a 
respect for social forms and usages is given by the family, and before the age proper 
for schooling. Then, again, it must be admitted that another part of this education. 
comes later, and is learned in the pursuit of one’s vocation in life—the education 
that comes from bending one’s energies into a special channel for the purpose of earn- 
ing a living. Another form of education is to be found in the part that one bears in 
politics within one’s party, or in the exercise of functions conferred by the state, or 
still further, in the exercise of patriotic feeling. Lastly, there is the church, which 
furnishes a form of education most important, because it lays fullest stress on human 
duty, basing it on divine commands. The church educates the individual into the 
sense of his existence as a mere unsubstantial creature when living in neglect of the 
divine ideal manhood, but as a substantial and eternally blessed life when lived 
according to the forms prescribed in religion. These forms are forms that respect 
the welfare of the whole and measure the conduct of the individual by his preference 
of that welfare over his own selfish impulses. 
The family, the vocation, the state, the church, are the four great cardinal insti- 
tutions of education. The school is only a device brought in to reenforce these 
substantial institutions; but it is a very important device, notwithstanding its supple- 
mentary character. It may reenforce the family by giving to the youth the com- 
mand of such conyentionalities as reading and writing and moral behavior; or it 
may reenforce the vocation by giving instruction in arts and trades or professions;

1314 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
or it may reenforce the church as a Sunday school, giving instruction in religion; the 
military school or the naval school may reenforce the education of the state. 
Our question deals directly with the education of the school; but we must care- 
fully bear in mind the several educational functions of these institutions, so as not 
to overestimate the functions of the school, or in any way confound its province 
with what belongs to the great social institutions. 
Family education must furnish that indispensable preliminary education in per- 
sonal habits, such as cleanliness, care of the person and clothing, respectful treat- 
ment of elders and superiors, obedience to authority, the sense of shame, religious 
observances, and the use of the mother tongue. The school must presuppose that 
these are already taught by the family, but the school must not neglect them, 
although it does not make them its special aim. The family does more, in fact, than 
educate the child in those indispensable things just recited. It builds up within the 
child’s mind the structure of his moral character, making for him a second nature 
of moral habit and custom, whose limits and boundaries he regards as of supreme 
moment. This second nature, or moral nature, is secured by daily sacrifice, and all 
forms of education lay stress upon self-sacrifice as the foundation of their disciplines. 
This process which we call education is, in short, essentially the shaping of man by 
habit into an ideal or spiritual type of being; a realization of what we call human 
nature in contradistinction to mere animal nature. It is an artificial life, a conven- 
tional form of living, but it is far more substantial and divine than the life of the 
mere animal man. Man, as an animal, is a savage; as civilized, he is an ethical 
being, who has set up within himself a system of duties and obligations which he 
observes at the expense uf neglecting the impulses of ‘his merely animal nature. 
To what end is all this? Is it not because man, as an individual, wills to combine 
with his fellow-men in such a way as to avail himself of the united endeavor of all? 
By the organization of social institutions he converts a multitude of atomic individ- 
uals into a social unity. The individuals do not get lost in this social unity, like the 
waves of the sea. But the social unity is of that wonderful character that it reen- 
forces the might of each individual by the might of the whole. 
Speaking technically, the individual becomes the species; or, in giving up by self- 
_ sacrifice his selfish peculiarities and devoting himself to the service of others, he 
gains for himself the service of all mankind. The individuals are transmuted into 
one grand individual, of which each individual is the head, and each individual is 
also the foot. According to Kant’s definition, a living organism is such that every 
part of it is alike means and end to all the other parts. So, in this social body, 
every individual human being is alike the means and the end for all others. Hence 
there is a ‘Grand Man,” as Swedenborgians say. ° 
In the matter of food, clothing, and shelter, the individual toils in his vocation to 
produce a special product, something useful to the rest, and demanded in the market 
ofthe world. In return for this gift of his day’s labor he is permitted to draw from the 
market of the world his share of all the productions collected from all climes, brought 
hither by the commerce of nations. This is a perpetual process of united human 
endeavor, in which, by self-sacrifice, the individual reenforces himself by the race. 
So, too, the family, the most embryonic of human institutions—the family enables 
the elder to assist the younger, the mature the immature, the well and strong to 
assist the sick and weak. It equalizes age and bodily condition, Pee each 
condition by the aid of all others. 
The great object, then, of education is the preparation of the individual for.a life 
in institutions, the preparation of each individual for social combination. Education 
inculcates sacrifice of animal proclivities, in order to secure a higher well-being in the 
life of the community. 
Crime is, therefore, a reaction on the part of the individual against the very object 
of education. It attacks the necessary forms of social life, and asserts for itself the 
right to persist in the form of the nonsocial individual. Society must defend itself, 
 
-P-A-G-E-75
  
eee 
EDUCATION AND CRIME, — 1315 
and reduce the rebellious individual to harmony with itself. Inasmuch as the social 
form is such that the individual who puts it on and becomes a member of the family, 
the community or the State, does not act directly for himself, but works for others 
and accepts the service of others in return for his own deed, so, too, punishment for 
crime takes on the same form; the criminal is made to receive for his deed an equiva- 
lent reflected back from society. As his deed injures society, it is returned upon 
him by society and injures him. If he attacks his neighbors by personal violence, 
his deed is made to come back to him by physical constraint or even by violent death 
on the gallows. If he attacks the property of his fellow-men, he is made to suffer in 
property, in the possession of personal freedom and the right to the products of his 
own labor. Thus, society treats the criminal who rebels against it just as though he, 
the criminal, had intended to do a social deed, and not a selfish one. It is a piece of 
irony. The State says to the criminal: ‘‘ Of course, you recognize society, and expect 
to reap what you sow. You have an undoubted right to possess and enjoy the fruits 
of your own deeds. I will see that they are returned upon you. Your deed of vio- 
lence on your neighbor shall therefore return upon you. Whatever you do youshall 
do to yourself.”” 
Turning now from this view of the general educative character of the institutions 
of society, and the end and aim of all society to aid the individual by the might of 
the whole, and from this study of crime, let us define for ourselves the place of the 
school in education, and try to discover its relation to the prevention of crime. 
The school, as we have seen, is a means of education auxiliary to each of the four 
cardinal institutions, and as such, the school in all of its forms is ethical and pre- 
ventive of crime. The ordinary type of school—the so-called ‘‘common school’’— 
receives the child from the family at the age of 5 or 6 years. It receives him into a 
social body (for the school is a community), and educates him by “discipline” and 
“instruction,” as they are technically called. By ‘‘discipline” is meant the train- 
ing in behavior, a training of the will, moral training. It consists in imposing upon 
the child a set of forms of behavior rendered necessary in order to secure concert of 
action—such forms as regularity, punctuality, silence, and industry. These are the 
four cardinal duties of the school pupil. Without them the school can not act asa 
unit, instruction can not be given in classes, and no good result achieved. We call 
these duties mechanical duties, but they underlie all higher ethics. Without silence 
in the school, without self-sacrifice on the part of each pupil, restraining his impulse 
to prate and chatter and occupy the attention of his fellow-pupils, there could be no 
work done. Each pupil would interfere with the work of every other pupil and the 
result would be chaos or worse—because anarchy is chaos made active and hostile to 
heaven’s first law. 
Order is not only the first celestial law, but it is the first law of all social combination. 
The school could not possibly undertake a more direct and efficient training of the 
child for social combination than it does undertake in its four cardinal phases of dis- 
cipline—regularity, punctuality, silence, and industry. 
Its method of securing these items of discipline may be good, bad, or indifferent, 
according to the pains it takes to convert external constraint into willing obedience 
and unconscious habit. The good school unquestionably shows us the constant spec- 
tacle of good behavior become or becoming a second nature to the pupils, so that 
there is a maximum of regularity, punctuality, silence, and industry with a minimum 
of self-consciousness in regard to it, although there is an insight into the necessity of 
such conformity to rule, and a conscious conviction in favor of it whenever any 
untoward occasion brings up the question. Consequently there is a minimum of cor- 
poral punishment in the good school. Necessary as it is in dealing with crude 
depravity, the school must have got far beyond that stage of discipline before it can 
be called ‘‘good.’” 3 
This training of the will, we observe, is a training of each pupil to behave in such 
a form of artificial or conventional restraint that he may conibine in the best manner 
   
-P-A-G-E-76
  13816 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-99. 
with his fellow-pupils, and be in a condition.to give to and receive from them school 
instruction. Is it not clear that, once trained to observe set forms of behavior in the 
school, it becomes a second nature to observe such forms everywhere, and the indi- 
vidual has solved the problem of life so far as the prevention of crime is concerned? 
But discipline in the school is wholly formal. It exists for an end; this end is 
instruction. What is the character of this instruction? First of all, school instruc- 
tion aims to give the child an ability to use the arts of reading, writing, and arith- 
metic, the famous ‘‘three R’s.”” He must learn to read the printed page, to represent; 
in written characters his own words, and to enumerate the objects of the world. 
Here, it is of first importance to note the fact that these fundamental studies of the 
school concern social combination quite as much as the four cardinal phases of disci- 
pline, just considered. To learn to read the printed page is to learn how to use the 
aggregated experience of mankind. The experience of mankind is ethical; for it 
contains only one lesson, infinitely repeated—the lesson of the necessity of con- 
formity to law in order to achieve human well-being. Human experience records 
nothing but the success of combined human endeavor, and the failure of selfishness 
which avoids such combination. What is reading in itself except the art of appro- 
priating for one’s self the thoughts of one’s fellow-men? Reading and writing are 
the arts of intercommunication par excellence. Arithmetic is the art of making 
quantitative combinations, and is equally fundamental, so far as the quantitative 
phases of society are concerned. Arithmetic, moreover, underlies all conquest over 
nature. Divide and conquer the empire of things by means of arithmetic. 
As to the practical effects of reading and writing in the prevention of crime, we 
have had evidence pointing in that direction in the statistics of jails and prisons. 
The rationale of such effects may now be partially clear. The ability to read and 
the actual use of this ability in reading tend to bring to bear the life of society as a 
whole upon the life of the individual. Suppose he reads a newspaper. He finds 
interest in the deeds of his fellow-men—chiefly national deeds in wars and treaties, 
deeds of civil society in trade and commerce and other industries, deeds of crime 
and deeds of retribution by the tribunals of justice, society gossip dealing with man- 
ners. How surprising, when we think of it, is the fact that the most empty species 
of literature, the so-called ‘trashy novel,’’ is filled with descriptions of the manners 
of polite society—in short, full of the details of these forms which appertain not to 
the individual as mere animal, but to the individual as member of society! The 
trashy novel portrays for the raw, inexperienced youth its ideal of the behavior of 
men and women in society. It shows bad manners and good manners, to the mani- 
fest advantage of the latter. Manners are superficial? Yes, but indispensable to 
man’s life in institutions. Like the Egyptian sphinxes that lined the avenues of 
temples at Karnak and Luxor, they form the approach to the spiritual sanctuary 
itself. All instruction in good manners is of the nature of a safeguard to virtue and 
preventive of crime. 
The man who reads habitually breathes the atmosphere of social human existence, 
and is in so far made to feel the substantiality of social life over mere brute life. He 
learns to look upon his every act from the standpoint of public opinion. He views 
all his own industry in its relation to the industry of his fellow-men. 
The school, therefore, in teaching reading, writing, and arithmetic, deals in the 
most direct manner with forms of civilization by giving the individual the means of 
appropriating to himself the wisdom of the human race. In the newspaper, he may 
see the daily spectacle of humanity at large—a vision of his own human nature 
realized on a large scale in allmankind. As particular person, he is only a possibility 
of man, having realized only one small phase of human nature. In the human race, 
he sees the revelation of all the possibilities of human nature. This spectacle of the 
race is possible through the printed page, the newspaper, and the library. 
But the common school has other studies, every one of which, however, tends in 
the same direction as the’“‘three R’s.”’ There is geography, manifestly adapted to
-P-A-G-E-77
EDUCATION AND ORIME. : 1317 
give to the individual a knowledge of the world of individuals. It shows their 
habitat, their means for production of food, clothing and shelter, and culture. Who 
are my fellow-men, and how do they live? What are they doing for me, and what 
from my industry goes to them? The veil of the near horizon lifts, and reveals to 
this private individual the society in which he exists—1, 200,000,000 human beings all 
looking hitherward with their daily tasks! The study of geography is preventive 
of crime in so far as it teaches the same lesson of social combination that we have 
already discussed. 
Again, there is history as a common-school study. It is the study which looks 
toward the nation as an institution, for its individuals are nations. This is the one 
study that develops patriotism. Take away all knowledge of history, all knowledge 
of nations, all knowledge of the past and present of one’s own nation, and there 
could be no patriotism; even the object of patriotism would not exist in the mind. 
The high and pure devotion of one’s self to his country, the high and pure interest 
in all peoples on this planet—both these are cultivated by the study of history. 
The school teaches the pupil how to study history and where to find it. 
There is study, more or less, of a purely scientific character carried on in the 
school. There is grammar, the science of the organization of language showing how 
reason reveals itself in its special creation, human speech. The framework of reason 
is logic, and logic is revealed in the laws of syntax and etymology. Self-knowledge 
of an intimate kind, therefore, is reached in the study of grammar. Inasmuch ag 
language is not the product of individual industry, but a joint product of human 
society, it is clear enough, without analysis, that language studies in school all lead to 
an insight into human combination and tend, therefore, to the prevention of crime. 
Doubtless the school alone is only a small part of education, but it is a very impor- 
tant part for the reason that it deals with conventionalities, technical means—instru- 
mentalities shall we call them?—of human intercourse—in short, with the tools of 
human, spiritual combination. 
Now any one or all of the educational agencies may fail absolutely to prevent 
crime. But social science does not find other recourse than to strive to make more 
efficient these agencies, improve the family nurture, improve the schools, the trades 
and vocations, the partisan politics, the Sunday school. All these instrumentalities 
are very crude, as we may easily see, in their present condition. The question that 
immediately concerns us in this paper is the improvement of common-school educa- 
tion as preventive of crime by making it more effective in reaching all the children 
of the community. 
Undoubtedly compulsory education is a valuable means for this end. I do not see 
why the common form adopted is not sufficiently effective. Children under 10 
years of age shall not be employed in any species of labor that takes them from 
school. Between 10 and 14 years, children shall not be employed in any industry 
that prevents them from receiving at least twenty weeks’ schooling for each two 
years. So much education as this provides for will prove very efficient in training 
the average youth in correct ethical habits. 
There will be special cases wherein parental education has failed, and there has 
happened a consequent premature hardening of the disposition of the child to such 
an extent that the school can not remedy it. Here we must pause a moment to call 
attention to the kindergarten as a very valuable instrumentality, especially in two 
directions very difficult to reach in common schools if neglected until the children 
are past 6 years of age. The kindergarten takes children at 4 years or even earlier, 
at the period when the child has begun to be interested in the outer world, as he 
catches glimpses of it beyond the family circle. ‘The children of very poor parents 
are prone to neglect the education of the child at this age, and he grows up amid 
constant lessons in wickedness and vice. On the other hand, in families that have 
become suddenly rich the parents are so much engaged in readjusting themselves to 
their new social positions and in directing their business affairs that they leave their

precocious children to incompetent nurses and governesses, who pamper them into 
self-indulgent youth, destined to earlyruin. The kindergarten, all of whose methods 
are based on true ideas of social combination, has proved very potent in saving both 
these classes of youth—the depraved of the proletariat and the depraved of the 
wealthy class. 
It is clear, when we study the kindergarten and come to understand its methods 
of utilizing play, that healthy amusement among young people could be made edu- 
cative of the social sense more largely than it is, and thus be another preventive of 
crime. 
Industrial education in the form of the school, since the practical abolition of 
apprenticeship, is also important. The manual training school and the school-shop, 
modeled on the Russian or on the Swedish plan, ought to be established to a limited 
extent in all our cities, and made free, like the common schools. They give admir- 
able instruction in wood-working and in metal-working. But when we reflect that 
the total number of laborers in metals, iron, steel, tin, copper, brass, etc., of all 
descriptions, counting 22 trades as given in our census, amount only to 585,493 
persons, or about one in one hundred of our population, or three in one hundred of 
all persons actually engaged in gainful occupations, we see that it would be easy to 
overcrowd the metal industries and cause disappointment to youth whose parents 
had placed them in industrial schools with the idea that they were preparing to 
earn their living thereby. 
Counting, in like manner, the laborers in the 25 trades of wood-working, we find 
an aggregate of 763,814 persons, or one and one-half persons in each hundred of 
the entire population, or say five in each hundred of the people earning their living 
by gainful occupations. The same danger of overcrowding these trades is apparent. 
The country is now producing more manufactures of wood and metal than are 
needed in all its markets, domestic and foreign, and yet it employs in those indus- 
tries less than 3 per cent of the population and is needing a still smaller ratio on 
account of its constantly improving machinery. 
Turning from this dismal view, one may see clearly that more and more labor is 
needed in ornamental industries—industries that can produce goods of artistic 
value. All education that trains the taste of the workman if a positive gain, and 
makes a place for workmen who will hold the world market firm and secure, and 
who will never be thrown out of employment on account of overproduction. 
One cause of crime that should not escape our attention while we are discussing 
this question of education is the increasing growth of cities in our country, due to 
the invention of labor-saving machinery. The city furnishes a hiding-place for 
criminals who raid on the property of rural districts. There is a constant recruiting 
of wayward youth in country and town into organized gangs of thieves and bur- 
glars. No State legislature seems to have taken up this problem effectively. There 
ought to be a new form of police invented—a sort of detective force, which makes 
its business the systematic pursuit of thieves and burglars that raid on the rural 
districts. At present, left entirely unpunished, they thrive and grow numerous, 
educating into high criminals a large class of wayward youth. 
Increasing urban growth for the most part furnishes us our social problems. Com- 
pulsory education in the forms of the common school, the kindergarten, the indus- 
trial art school, may furnish us the most valuable preventive agencies against crime. 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS AS AFFECTING CRIME AND VICE. 
[Extracts from an article by Benjamin Reece in the Popular Science Monthly for January, 1890.] 
It is claimed, and almost universally allowed, that the instruction of our public 
schools serves to ennoble the emotions and to moderate the passions, to regenerate 
the viciously inclined, and to correct and subdue the tendency to crime. Devoutly 
as such a result is to be desired, the facts, unhappily, flatly contradict the theory, and,
-P-A-G-E-79
  
    
EDUCATION AND ORIME. 1319 
unless the glaring inconsistencies are reconciled and contravening evidence is satis- 
factorily explained, the claim must be abandoned as unfounded. 
At a session of the National Prison Congress held in Boston during 1888, Mr. 
Brooker, chairman of the board of directors of the South Carolina Penitentiary, 
having made the statement that of a thousand convicts in the State not more than 
fifty were whites, it was asked by a delegate, ‘‘ What is the condition of the educa- 
tion of the colored people?’’ To this question Mr. Brooker made the following reply: 
“Before emancipation the colored people had no opportunity for education. When 
made suddenly free all negroes were illiterate and ignorant. Since that time a 
young generation has grown up, and of them a very considerable number are well 
educated. But it is a fearful fact that a large proportion of our prison population is 
of the educated class. This is so much the case that the idea has become prevalent 
that to educate a negro is to make him a rascal. But this idea is, of course, super- 
ficial, and does not find lodgment in the minds of thoughtful men. I am totally 
averse to it myself, and think that all reasonable means should be exerted towatd 
their enlightenment and education. * * *’ (Proceedings of the National Prison 
Association, 1888, p. 72.) 
Here was the most astonishing fact that in South Carolina, which in 1880 had 
more than half of its population returned as illiterate, the educated negroes furnish 
a large proportion of its criminals, pressed upon a representative body of philan- 
thropists, publicists, and statesmen, and it did not so much as provoke a comment, 
while the author of the statement boldly affirmed his unshaken faith in a theory 
the facts of which he had himself impugned. What deference should we pay to 
thought unless based upon correct observations, and of what utility are facts and 
experiences unless their teachings are heeded and their meaning properly inter- 
preted? 
In his Political Science, Woolsey tells us that ‘‘the fall of the Roman Empire was 
an effect of a moral ruin.’ Yet all will admit that Rome and the other civiliza- 
tions of antiquity were richer and more learned in the time of their decay than dur- 
ing the period of their infancy and growth; but the moral correlative being wanting, 
they tottered to their fall. 
Just look at the records of our mentally and morally deranged as exhibited in our 
statistics of insanity and crime and vice, and they alone are enough to cast a doubt 
upon the claim that a public-school education for our illiterates is sufficient to insure 
a decrease of mental and moraldelinguency. For it remains to be explained why, 
in the decade ending with 1880, population haying increased 30 per cent and illit- 
eracy only 10 per cent, a relative decrease, the number of criminals during the same 
period presents the alarming increase of 82 per cent, while of insane persons there 
appears the enormous addition of 1451 per cent. 
Can it be possible that with greater educational facilities there is to be increased 
crime, and that every enlargement in the seating capacity of our schools is to be fol- 
lowed by a larger corresponding demand for insane accommodations and additional 
felons’ cells? Perish the thought! Yet, if the instruction of our common schools . 
subdues the tendency to crime, why is it that the ratio of prisoners,” being 1 in 3,442 
inhabitants in 1850, rose to 1 in every 1,647 in 1860, 1 in 1,021 in 1870, and 1 in 837 
in 1880; while, upon the authority of the Rev. 8. W. Dicke, the amount of liquor 
consumed per capita was three times as great in 1883 as in 1840? 
One naturally looks to the large and constant influx of foreign immigrants asa par- 
tial explanation of this growing disproportionate increase of crime; but the facts 
deny the hope, for the great increase is to be found among the native born. The 
Rev. F. H. Wines, who conducted this branch of the Tenth Census Report, says that, 
while in 1850 the ratio of foreign criminals to population was five times that of the 
  
1]t is but fair to state that this enormous increase of insanity has led the compiler to question the 
accuracy of the returns of insane persons made in 1870, yet it is admitted that, after making every 
allowance, the ratio of increase is out of all proportion to that of population. (See page 1660, Com- 
pendium of the Tenth Census.)

native born, in 1880 the ratio was only 2 to 1; and if we deduct the commitments for 
disorder and immorality, the ratio of foreign criminals is but little in excess of that 
for native whites. So clearly is this indicated by facts and figures that Mr. Wines 
arrives at the conclusion that ‘‘the foreign disregard for law shows itself far more 
in immorality and disorder than in dishonesty and violence.’’! 
An examination of the Compendium of the Tenth Census of the United States dis- 
closes some novel and threatening facts. The illiterates of the United States com- 
prise 17 per cent of the total population. The morally and mentally deranged, as 
shown by the number of criminal and insane persons, bear the ratio of 1 to every 
882. The general average of illiteracy is exceeded by every one of the original slave 
States, with the exception of Missouri, but the average ratio of the mentally and mor- 
ally unsound is only reached in the State of Maryland. South Carolina, which shows 
the highest percentage of illiterates, viz, 55.4 per cent, presents the lowest average 
of,any State in the Union as regards insanity and crime, haying but 1 delinquent in 
every 568 inhabitants as compared with 1 in every 167 in California, 1 in 205 in 
Massachusetts, and 1 in every 222 in the State of New York. With the single excep- 
tion of the State of Maine, every Northern State east of Indiana has a larger ratio of 
insane and criminals than the average for the Union, while the States west of Ohio, 
those on the Pacific slope excepted, fall below the general average. 
If we measure the extent of unrecorded vice by the proportion of saloons to popu- 
lation, the showing is no less remarkable. The Report of the Commissioner of 
Internal Revenue for the year 1887, page xxxiii, shows that, for the entire country 
during that year, a retail license for selling liquor was granted for every 329 inhabit- 
ants. Of the fifteen States showing more than the average number of illiterates, 
that ratio was only exceeded in the State of Louisiana, while the lowest average in 
the country was to be found in Mississippi, which, with 49.5 per cent of its inhabit- 
ants returned in 1880 as being illiterate, supported but 1 saloon for every 1,695 
persons. Eyen the prohibition States of Maine and Kansas secured licenses for 
the sale of intoxicants at retail to an extent only equalled by four of the super- 
illiterate States. The proportion of saloons to population throughout the fifteen 
superilliterate States is 1 for every 700 inhabitants, while of the other States Cali- 
fornia heads the list with 1 to every 99 persons, New Jersey coming next with 1 
license to every 171 inhabitants, followed closely by New York, with 1 to every 179. 
The table which follows presents some disquieting facts which should serve as a 
salutary warning to those who expect to find in mental stimulation an equivalent 
for moral growth and culture:

The table unmistakably shows a greater per capita of wealth where the fewest 
illiterates are enumerated, but it no less clearly shows that this augmentation of 
riches has been accompanied by increased insanity and crime and more widespread 
vice. 
But we need not confine ourselves to the general statistics of the United States, 
for the records of New York present similar conditions which can be analyzed more 
in detail. The annual report of the superintendent of the New York State prisons, 
1886, records that the prisons of Auburn and Sing Sing contained 2,616 convicts; of 
these, 1,801 are credited with a common-school education, 373 are classed as being 
able to read and write, 19 are returned as collegiates, 10 as having received classical 
and 78 academic educations, 97 as being able to read only, and 238 as having no edu- 
cation. Is it not contrary to our most confident predictions and undoubted expecta- 
tions that the common schools should furnish 83 per cent and the colleges and 
academies over 4 per cent of the inmates of Auburn and Sing Sing?! 
When it is remembered that the detected illiterate generally finds his way to prison, 
while the highly educated or well-to-do are frequently saved by friends, who com- 
pound the felony to escape exposure and consequent family disgrace; that many are 
saved from conviction by the ability of counsel whose services are far beyond the 
means of illiterate poor, while still many others escape in voluntary exile to avoid 
imprisonment, it will be seen that even the figures given inadequately portray the 
extent of crime which, in strict justice, is properly chargeable to the educated classes. 
Of the prisoners of Auburn and Sing Sing it is further noted that 20 per cent were 
total abstainers from intoxicants, showing very clearly that a perfect mastery of self 
is by no means necessarily alien with an honest regard for the pepe of property of 
Others he" eo 
Far from mental stimulation being essential to moral development, the most per- 
fect erder and deepest sense of justice are often found associated with the densest 
ignorance among the lowest races of humanity. Turn your attention to the Papuan 
Islanders,? the Veddahs,’ the Dyaks of Borneo,‘ the Fuegians,® and other barbarous 
races which, in the absence of rulers or organized societies, with no learning, and 
but little acquaintance with even the rude arts of many primitive people, have 
developed the highest degree of tribal piety, integrity, chastity, and regard for cov- 
enants almost unknown to civilized man. The testimony of early travelers proves 
conclusively that intense poverty and deep ignorance are by no means incompatible 
with honesty, integrity, and virtue. 
The table shows that where the extremes of poverty and wealth prevail, as in the 
  
1 The report for Clinton prison simply classified the prisoners received during the year, and it could 
not be included with Auburn and Sing Sing, which classify all inmates. 
2“ tis worthy of remark that these simple islanders, without hope of reward or fear of future pune 
ishment after death, live in such peace and brotherly love with one another, and that they recognize 
the right of property in the fullest sense of the word, without there being any authority among them 
other than the decision of their elders, according to the customs of their forefathers, which are held 
in the highest regard.” (Earl Kolff’s Voyages of the Dogma, p. 161.) 
8“ The Rock Veddahs are divided into small clans, or families, associated for relationship, who 
agree, partitioning the forests among themselves for hunting grounds, the limits of each family’s pos- 
session being marked by streams, hills, rocks, or some well-known trees, and these conventional 
allotments are always honorably recognized and mutually preserved from violation. Each party has 
a headman, the most energetic senior of the tribe, but who exercises no authority except distribut- 
ing at a particular season the honey captured by the members of the clan.” (Tennant, IJ, p. 440.) 
4“ The Dyaks’ minds are as healthy as their bodies; theft, brawling, and adultery are unknown to 
them.” (Boyle’s Borneo, p. 335.) 
“The Dyaks are manly, hospitable, honest, kindly, and humane to a degree which might well 
shame ourselves.” (Ibid, p. 215.) il 
5 “ Nothing like a chief could be made out of the Fuegians of Blunder Cove, nor did they seem to 
require one for the peace of their society, for their behavior one to another was most affectionate, 
and all property seemed to be Possessed i in common.” (Weddell’s Voyages toward the South Pole, 
p. 168.)

Eastern States, there is found a maximum of moral and mental derangement, as 
exhibited in insanity, crime, and vice. Where wealth is more evenly distributed, 
as in the Western States, there are noted less insanity and crime, but almost as high 
a ratio of saloons as in the East. In the Southern States, although having a low per 
capita of wealth, yet the mental and moral forces of development are nearly in 
adjustment with the material of environment; hence the average of crime and vice 
is shown by the table to be relatively low. 
The Rey. F. H. Wines, statistician and philanthropist, who has made questions of 
crime and criminals the study of a lifetime, was selected by the authorities at Wash- 
ington to compile the statistics bearing on delinquents in the Tenth Census, and after 
a careful study of the mass of figures returned, but few of which appear in the com- 
pendium, he makes this very remarkable statement concerning the facts collected 
and engmerated: ‘‘If a comparison is made between offenses against public morals 
and against public peace, the smallest amount of disorder and the largest amount of 
immorality, relatively, are found among the native whites; the most disorderly and 
least immorality among the negroes; and the foreigners occupy a middle ground 
between the two.’? (American Prisons in the Tenth Census, Proceedings of the 
National Prison Association for 1888, p. 268.) When it is realized that the native 
whites represent the better educated portion of our population and the negroes the 
more illiterate, while the foreigners are on an educational scale between the two, 
the significance of the statement can neither be gainsaid nor belittled. 
IS CRIME INCREASING IN MASSACHUSETTS ?? 
By Davin C. ToRREY. 
The question which I shall endeavor to decide is not the technical question, 
whether the number of cases which are brought before the courts of justice are 
increasing from year to year, but the broader and more important question, whether 
there is an increase of crime in Massachusetts which indicates a decline in social 
order. 
T use the word ‘‘crime”’ as meaning such violation of law as the civil courts punish 
when called upon to punish them; and by ‘‘increase of crime’? I shall mean, not 
simply an increase of cases dealt with by the courts, but an increase of such cases as 
the courts might deal with if the cases were brought before them. 
A complete study of the prison statistics returned to the Massachusetts legislature 
during the last forty years compels the admission that the courts are making, from 
year to year, an increasing number of commitments to prisons. I give below the 
commitments to all prisons in Massachusetts during those years since 1850 in which 
a State census was taken. That the tendency of crime during these years may be 
clearly seen, I give the population of the State and the number of people to each 
commitment.

  EDUCATION AND CRIME. 1323 
This table shows that the proportion of commitments to population varies much 
from year to year, and that during the course of the years selected there is a tendency 
to increase. Perhaps this increase can be best indicated by the average number of 
people to each commitment during the first half and the second half of the period. 
From 1850 to 1865 there was 1 commitment to 103 persons. From 1870 to 1885 there 
was 1 commitment to 82 persons, an increase of almost exactly 25 per cent. 
If we stopped our inquiry here we should be made to acknowledge that crime is 
increasing. But the figures do not always tell the whole truth, and an examination 
behind them in this ease reveals a very different state of affairs from that which the 
surface indicates. The form in which the reports have been made to the legislature 
enables us to divide the crimes for which commitments are made into two classes: 
The crimes more dangerous to society, like murder and burglary, and the crimes less 
dangerous, like drunkenness and disturbing the peace. To show clearly the move- 
ments in crime in the State, I make this division in two ways: First, by separating 
crimes against persons and property from crimes against public order; and, second, 
by separating the crimes other than intemperance from crimes of intemperance. 
Owing to the form in which the statistics were returned to the State, I can not 
make the separation by the first plan cover a long series of years. This division was 
made in the returns for 1865, but was not in those for 1875. This division indicates 
well the changes in crime in recent years.

serious crimes—those against public order and decency. Before discussing this table 
at length, I present the division of crimes by the second plan, that of the crimes of 
intemperancé seperated from all other crimes. Here I am able to compare the com- 
mitments for crimes with the population of the State through a wider range of years. 
In 1875 the gross commitments were returned, but no division by crimes was made. 
In commitments for intemperance are included commitments for drunkenness and 
as common drunkards.

As the previous division in Table No. 2 showed that the marked increase of com- 
mitments was for crimes against public order, this table shows that the marked 
increase is in commitments for intemperance. A comparison of the commitments 
with the population of the State in the years in which the commitments were made 
proves that the increase in commitments which I have shown in Table No. 1 is con- 
fined wholly to crimes against public order; and even that the commitments for all 
other crimes than intemperance, taken together, are not only not increasing, but 
show a marked decrease. 
The following table shows the commitments in proportion to population for the 
more serious crimes during those years in which a comparison can be made with the 
population of the State:

aThis division was not made in returns to the legislature. 
It is seen that the average in 1865 and 1870 was 1 commitment for crime against 
persons or property for about each 301 inhabitants, while in 1880 and 1885 the aver- 
age was 1 commitment to about 436 inhabitants. This indicates a decrease in the 
more serious crimes of 44 per cent. 
Let us apply the same method of comparison with population to the commitments, 
as divided by our second plan, into those of intemperance and those for all other 
crimes. For our purpose only the ratio to population of commitments for crimes 
other than intemperance need be shown:

Here we find again that there has been a marked decrease in the commitments for 
all crimes other than intemperance, taken together, in proportion to the population 
of the State. From 1850 to 1865 the average of commitments was 1 to about 174 
inhabitants; from 1870 to 1885 it was 1 commitment to about 241 inhabitants. Thus 
a decrease of 38 per cent is indicated in all crimes other than those of intemperance. 
I have now shown, as conclusively as can be shown by figures, that the crimes 
more dangerous to social order are not increasing, but that, on the contrary, they 
are diminishing at a rapid rate; more than this, I have shown that all crimes taken 
together, other than intemperance, are decreasing at a rate almost as rapid. I can 
now confine my inquiry about the increase of crime in Massachusetts to the one 
crime of intemperance.
-P-A-G-E-85
  EDUCATION AND ORIME. 1825 
The question resolves itself to this: Is intemperance increasing? The number of 
commitments indicates that it is. The total number of commitments is increasing, 
the commitments for all crimes other than intemperance are not increasing; then the 
commitments for intemperance must be increasing. 
I think, however, that it can be shown that the increase in commitments for 
intemperance does not, as in the case of more serious crimes, necessarily indicate an 
increase in crime, and also that this increase can be accounted for by changes in 
Jaw and changes in public opinion. 
The common opinion of intemperance as a crime is very different from the opin- 
ion of murder, or burglary, or even petty larceny. This is shown by the fact that 
while it is the exception that a person guilty of these other crimes escapes trial and 
conviction, comparatively few of the men who drink to excess are punished by the 
courts. Because of this difference in opinion of crimes the commitments for more 
serious crimes could not increase without an actual increase of those crimes, but 
there is a chance for an increase of commitments for intemperance without an 
actual increase of intemperance. 
Changes in the law affect the number of commitments for intemperance. In 1874, 
under a prohibitory law, the convictions for drunkenness in the State numbered 
23,981; in 1877, under local-option law, the number fell to 17,862. In Boston alone 
in 1874 the convictions numbered 11,428, but in 1877, with 2,834 licenses, the con- 
victions for drunkenness were only 7,539. 
The number of commitments for intemperance depends also upon public opinion. 
There is a large and vaguely defined field of intemperance from which increasing 
commitments may come with increasing intemperance. The number of men who 
are intemperate and escape arrest is so large that an increase of commitments for a 
long series of years is not incompatible with an actual decrease of intemperance. 
Public opinion decides the point at which the drinking man is no longer sober, but 
becomes a subject for commitment. It makes the law and supports the policeman 
who makes the arrest and the court which commits the drunken man. It is reason- 
able to believe that continual agitation has aroused public sentiment against intem- 
perance and so affected the laws and the courts that an increase of commitments for 
intemperance has taken place without a corresponding increase of crime. 
The single change which is made when the new legislation of any year makes a 
drunkard pay a fine where he would have been imprisoned under the old law, or, 
on the other hand, imprisons him where formerly he would have paid a fine, is not 
enough to change entirely the proportions of ‘‘commitments’’ to the population. 
But these changes do not, of course, affect the real proportion of drunkenness. 
From the facts I have presented I think the following conclusions can be drawn: 
The commitments by the courts of Massachusetts are increasing. 
The more serious crimes—those against persons and property—are decreasing 
rapidly. 
In all crimes other than intemperance, taken together, there is also a rapid 
decrease. 
The increased commitments for intemperance do not necessarily indicate an actual 
inerease of intemperance, for they may depend upon changes of law and changes in 
public opinion. 
On these grounds I think it safe to deny that there is an increase of crime in 
Massachusetts which threatens social order, or which indicates that, in spite of the 
educational, philanthropic, and religious effort in the State, its civilization is 
declining.

EDUCATION AND CRIME. 
[From an article by Rey. A. W. Gould, in the Popular Science Monthly for June, 1890.] 
In the January number of the Popular Science Monthly there was an article by 
Benjamin Reece on ‘‘ Public schools as affecting crime and vice.” * * * He thinks 
that the United States census proves that the increase of prisoners in our prisons is 
the result of the increase of pupils in our schools. And as I find that these ‘‘noyel 
and threatening facts’’ have aroused some apprehension among those interested in 
our public school system, it seems to me desirable that some one should point out 
the figures in our census which seriously modify, if not wholly destroy, Mr. Reece’s 
alarming inference that our public schools are nurseries of crime. 
Figures, like Bible texts, may not lie, but they can be made to prove almost 
anything; and it would not be difficult to establish by our census figures the exact 
opposite of Mr. Reece’s conclusion, if we may be allowed to use the same reasoning 
that he does. For his statistics only show that crime and education are both 
‘ increasing. But that does not prove that the increase in education is the cause of 
the increase in crime. Diseases have increaséd during the past half century and so 
has medical skill; but that does not prove that the one increase was caused by the 
other. Perhaps the increase of diseases would have been far greater had it not been 
for the increase in the power to cope with them. So education may, for aught Mr. 
Reece’s statistics prove, be the only thing that prevents a still more rapid growth in 
crime. 
The statistics of our last report show that the most enormous strides in developing 
a criminal class have been taken in those States where ignorance, and not education, 
most abounds. If we take the 10 States that have the largest number of citizens 
unable to write we shall find that from 1850 to 1880 the ratio of their prisoners has 
increased over fivefold; from 1 in 5,400 to 1 in 970; from 1860 to 1880 it has grown 
threefold, or from 1 in 3,600 to 1 in 970; while the 10 States that have the fewest 
citizens unable to write have swelled the proportion of their criminals only three- 
fold for the longer period and only 50 per cent for the shorter, the figures being, 
for 1850, 1 in 3,100; for 1860, 1 in 1,500, and for 1880, 1 in 1,050. So that in the 
States of greatest illiteracy the relative increase of criminals during the last twenty 
years has been six times as rapid as in the States of least illiteracy. And if we ask 
in what classes the most ignorance is to be found, our census tells us that the foreign 
born are 50 per cent more illiterate than the natives, and the blacks seven times as 
illiterate as the whites; and our census tells us further that the foreign born furnish 
100 per cent more than their share of criminals, and the blacks 150 per cent more 
than their share 
Do not these facts prove that the advance in crime is the result, not of education, 
but of the absence of education? We might think so if figures had not that repre- 
hensible habit of being all things to all men. Therefore, we may find upon a careful 
examination that there is some other cause than ignorance for this rapid growth of 
our prison population in certain parts of our country. IfI am not mistaken, there 
are several such causes, some of them entirely independent of the change in the 
illiteracy of the nation. One of them lies in the transition from an unsettled condi- 
tion to a settled condition on our constantly advancing frontiers; another is the 
change from slavery in the South; and a third is the gradual elevation of the stand- 
ard of human conduct, making crimes of actions that had hardly been lawful 
escapades in earlier times. 
The first cause comes out clearly if we compare the 10 States that were on the 
frontier in 1850 with 10 older States—the New England and Middle States, for 
instance. In the former the ratio of criminals has been multiplied four or five times 
during the past thirty years, while in the latter it has only been doubled, rising
-P-A-G-E-87

from 244 to 1,148 prisoners in a million inhabitants on the frontier and from 450 to 
1,074 on the seaboard. Of course, it is obvious that in a new country there will be 
a certain: amount of lawless conduct unpunished at first before sheriffs, courts, and 
jails are in running order. But the rapid increase in the proportion of criminals as 
the State grows older does not mean more crime; it often means less. The evil- 
doers are arrested and sentenced, and so get into our prisons and our census; and 
then we are told that crime is increasing. Kansas had only 289 prisoners to each 
million of inhabitants in the decade before the rebellion, while it had 1,300 to the 
same number in the last report, yet everyone knows that this State was a far more 
dangerous place at the earlier time than now. Colorado had only 477 offenders per 
million at its first census, in 1870, but in 1880 it reported 1,950, a gain of nearly five- 
fold in a single decade; while on the other hand the older States, like New Hamp- 
shire and Connecticut, showed an actual decrease in percentage during these periods. 
But the transition from slavery to freedom was a far more efficient cause in swell- 
ing the ratio of this class. If we compare 10 of the original slave States with our 
10 New England and Middle States, we shall find the increase in crime in the slave 
States has been three or four times as great as in the free States. The former had 
for each million of population only 161 criminals in 1850 and 240 the next decade; 
but in 1870 they had 829 and in 1880 1,166. This was an increase of sevenfold, while 
the free States only a little more than doubled their criminal element. 
That this was the result of the emancipation is seen in many ways. The sudden 
leap shows it between the decade before and after the war, or between 1860 and 1880, 
if 1870 be thought too near the contest to be a fair test. Those twenty years gave a 
gain of fivefold in the proportion of prisoners of the Southern States, while the 
Northern States showed a gain of less than 40 per cent. Single instances reveal it 
still more clearly. Mississippi sprang from 67 to 1,158 criminals in a million inhabi- 
tants, and other States of the South show nearly as great a gain; while New York 
and Massachusetts actually declined in their criminal percentage during that time, 
as did some other Northern States. 
The explanation is obvious. Before the war the negroes were slaves, and nearly 
all their offenses were punished by their masters, so that the State had no occasion 
to imprison them, But now from five to ten times as many blacks as whites, in pro- 
portion to their numbers, are found in the jails or chain gangs of the South. And 
when we remember that the greatest illiteracy is to be found in the former slave 
States, we see that the increase of the criminal ratio in the South may not be due 
wholly to ignorance in spite of census figures. The ignorance and crime were both 
there before the criminals were locked up and counted in the census. 
One might indeed claim that the lessened ignorance had much to do with reveal- 
ing this criminal element and imprisoning it. And this brings us to our third cause 
of the increased ratio of crime. The gradual elevation in the standard of life, and 
the intervention of the courts in cases which were formerly decided by the bullet or 
the knife, occasions a rapid increase in the number of official criminals. 
Drunkenness, I suppose, was not a crime anywhere in our land half a century ago. 
Now drunkenness and disorderly conduct form one-tenth of all the crime of the 
country. And, naturally, the restraint of these offenders will be most complete in 
the most orderly and educated parts of our land. Accordingly, we find that the 10 
educated States show a proportion of imprisonments for these offenses tenfold greater 
than the uneducated States do. The one had 2,865 and the other only 198 in a 
population three-fourths as large. And the educated States record three times as 
many prisoners as the uneducated States for assault and battery and simple assault. 
If anyone wishes to prove from the census that education is a failure, he could find 
no stronger facts than these—a tenfold larger share of drunkenness and a threefold 
larger share of violence in the States where men can read and write than in the 
States where they can not.
-P-A-G-E-88
  1328 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99, 
But, of course, no one thinks that the South is more quiet, orderly, and innocent 
than the North. No one believes that there was not a single case of drunkenness or 
disorder in all Alabama and Arkansas in 1880, and only a score of cases of assault, 
while Massachusetts, with a less population, had 597 cases of drunkenness and dis- 
order and 337 cases of assault; yet this is what the census tells us. The natural 
interpretation must be that drunkenness and violence are not punished by impris- 
onment in certain States, while they are in others, and the States that punish 
least are most illiterate. This interpretation is amply confirmed by the census itself. 
Though education shows three times the violence that ignorance does, yet ignorance 
perpetrates three times as many murders as education, and that, too, while two or 
three of the educated States imprison the murderer for life, and so swell the 
ona penS as te 
One of the results of raising the mass to a higher moral level is that individuals 
here and there drop out, and the higher we are raised the more will drop, and this 
will continue until those incapable of self-control have disappeared. It is only 
among savages—where there is no chance to drop, because all are on the ground— 
that we find no criminals or paupers. And Mr. Reece actually sighs for the ‘ per- 
fect order’’ found associated with the ‘‘densest ignorance’’ among the cave-dwelling 
; Veddahs and other tribes. Possibly we might attain this ‘perfect order’’ if we 
_would imitate the savages in leading a savage life, but that would be a pretty dear 
price to pay for such order as savages secure. 
+ Most of us prefer civilization with all its drawbacks. We prefer to'see our country 
settled, though we know that jails will be built and occupied. The very conyen- 
ience of city life is paid for by added crime. The disorder that might be allowed in 
a wilderness among savages can not be tolerated in a crowded metropolis among 
civilized people. The ten States that have the largest cities punish 50 per cent more 
violence and 60 per cent more drunkenness than their share, though they have 20 
per cent less than their proportion of murders. * * * 
I think, then, we need not fear that universal education is to bring us universal 
crime. We want more and better education. Of course, it is not the mere ability 
to read and write that is to save a man from prison. He must learn self-control and 
acquire a loftier standard of life. Mr. Reece dwells much upon the fact that a large 
percentage of our criminals can read and write. But that does not prove that their 
education made them criminals. I dare say a still larger percentage of them can see, 
yet it was not their ability to see that made them criminals. The densest ignorance 
may, like total blindness, keep men from crime; but we do not propose to put 
out our eyes of either mind or body. We will have men learn to see better, morally 
and physically. It is imperfect education that has brought men to prison, as we see 
from the constant relation of our criminal class to our illiterate classes. They may, 
indeed, have some sort of an education, but the vast majority of them are ignorant 
themselves, and have ignorant kindred and associates; and to be ignorant amid the 
civilization of to-day is to be jealous and bitter and rebellious. 
The very fact that Mr. Reece cites to prove his thesis, that ignorance is innocence 
and knowledge crime, disproves it most completely. South Carolina, he says, has 
the highest percentage of illiteracy and the lowest of crime; but if he had taken one 
glance below the surface, he would have seen a fact far more ‘‘novel and threatening”’ 
than any he discovered. Out of the 626 criminals of South Carolina, 570 are black 
and only 56 are white. Why are there ten times as many blacks as whites in jail, 
when they constitute only three-fifths of the population? The only answer the 
census gives is in the fact that they are three times as illiterate as the whites. So 
that the very State summoned to prove that ignorance is exception from crime has 
ten-elevenths of its criminals from the most ignorant class in the country. But per- 
haps Mr. Reece thinks that their ignorance is not quite dense enough, as one in four 
can still write. They certainly have not yet reached the point where ignorance is bliss.

EDUCATION AND ORIME. 1829 
SCHOOL STATISTICS AND MORALS.! 
By W. T. Harris, United States Commissioner of Education, 
The question of the relation which school education bears to morals is a very old 
one, but it is always coming up again in some new form; and inasmuch as it is always 
profitable to inquire how we may make the school more effective in the direction of 
moral training, itis wise to have the question insome shape on every new programme of 
this association of superintendents. Morals include a wide range of virtues, on the 
one hand bordering on the province of religion, and even overlapping it in the case 
of such traits of character as hope, faith, and charity—what the church calls celestial 
virtues to distinguish them from the secular virtues of prudence, fortitude, temper- 
ance, and justice. 
All kinds of well-wishing and well-doing toward our fellow-men come under divine 
charity or loving kindness. Under faith as a virtue come all those mental convic- 
tions which hold us to the theory of the supremacy of good in the universe, and under 
hope, as the third of the religious virtues, come all such acts or endeavors as we make 
on the side of the supreme good. Faith is the intellectual virtue and hope is the 
virtue of the will, while charity is the virtue of both intellect and will. 
The lack of these celestial virtues produces what is called crime, because it sets the 
intellect and will and the heart against one’s fellow-men—that is to say, sean the 
social whole. 
Very justly, then, do theologians claim that religious education in this eda sense 
is the foundation of the institutions of civilization. But it does not necessarily follow 
that the school should be an appanage of the church, or that anything but secular 
education should be.attempted in it. This will depend upon the further question, 
whether the secular virtues and the secular work of the school are a real auxiliary 
to the good work of the church. If the habits taught in the school reenforce the 
spirit of kindness and mutual helpfulness toward one’s fellows, if the intellectual 
studies aid in the spread of Christian doctrines, then the secular school has a moral 
tendency, although it does not take up any direct functions of the church. 
I think that the most scientific student of social science will admit that the school 
is no substitute for the church, and that anation may possibly exist without a school, 
put that no nation can exist without a church. Even the savage tribes, with their 
yudimental civilization, have the rudiments of a church, and it occupies a far greater 
place in savage life than it does in the most advanced civilization. Religion dictates 
to the Indians of the pueblos what figures they shall weave into their blankets and 
how they shall plant and harvest their corn. But the religion of the highest civiliza- 
tion permits and encourages the conquest of nature by science and art, and separates, 
one after the other, the cardinal institutions—the family, civil society, and the state—- 
from the direct control of the church and emancipates them from its authority. 
Thus, Christianity is forever narrowing the circle of superstition and increasing the 
realm of enlightenment. 
Right here, however, comes in the first appeal to statistics, and the first attack and 
defense of the school on the line of moral influence. It is supposed, on the one 
hand, that purely secular instruction in ideas and habits must be antireligious, and 
consequently tend toward vice and crime. On the other hand, it is claimed that 
purely secular instruction reenforces religion and exerts an influence repressive of 
vice and crime, although it does not include any theologic teaching. Statistics are 
collated to show that the majority of criminals in our jails have attended school for 
a longer or shorter period. Statistics are likewise quoted to show that those States 
which have the oldest and most eflicient school systems have the largest number of

“criminals in their jails and State prisons. Assertions are made that education merely 
changes the character of the crime—for example, from robbery and theft, the crimes 
of the illiterate, to forgery and embezzlement or breach of trust, which are the crimes 
of those who have had school education. The returns of prisonsand jails have been 
often studied with a view to get the facts in these particulars. Most teachers are 
familiar with the collation of statistics made on the census returns of 1870 by E. D. 
Mansfield and published in General Eaton’s Report of the Bureau of Education for 
,1872. The returns from prisons and jails of 17 States, 14 of which were Western or 
| Middle States, gave an aggregate of 110,538 prisoners, of whom 27,581, or almost 
exactly 25 per cent, were illiterate or not able to write. 
/ The fact that three-quarters of all the prisoners could read and write and had had 
some schooling looked serious enough to challenge the good influence claimed for 
the schools. If school education is adverse to crime, why should not the statistics 
show that a majority of the prisoners are illiterate? 
At this point the subject was taken up by those who understood arithmetic, and 
the question was modified so as to ask whether a given number of illiterates in the 
population furnished as many criminals as the same number of persons who could 
read and write. Put in this shape the answer was intelligible. 
The illiteracy of the population in the seventeen States which furnished the 25 
per cent of illiterate criminals was about 4 per cent, according to the census of 1870. 
This 4 per cent of the population furnished 25 per cent of the criminals, and the 96 
per cent who could read and write furnished only 75 per cent. If 1 per cent of the 
illiterates had furnished only 1 per cent of the criminals‘it would appear that educa- 
tion made no difference in regard to crime. But the illiterates furnished more than 
six times their quota, while those who could read and write furnished one-fifth less 
than their quota, and the ratio of the two was 1 to 8. A thousand illiterates on an 
average furnished eight times as many prisoners as the same number who could read 
and write. 
This result worked out with much uniformity where the same degree of accuracy 
in keeping statistics prevailed. The very small quotas of illiterates in Iowa, Kansas, 
and Minnesota gave more than eight times their share of criminals, while the three 
Southern States included in the seventeen were reported as having 22 per cent of illit- 
erates in the population and as having 50 per cent of illiterate criminals, thus showing 
the illiterates to have five and one-third times their proper share of criminals. 
Within the past ten years many of the jails and reformatories have published com- 
parative tables, showing results for a term of years, during which accurate records 
have been kept. These are, of course, more valuable than the returns for any single 
year, because inequalities and unusual conditions are eliminated. In 1887, for instance, 
the jail at Detroit gave a summary for twenty-five years, showing an aggregate of 
40,338 committals, of whom.28,652 could read and write and 11,686 could not write. 
This gives eight times the quota of criminals to the illiterates, because in the total 
population of the State there were less than 5 per cent of illiterates. : 
To be mentioned as foremost among institutions keeping and publishing accurate 
and discriminating records in these matters are the Illinois Penitentiary at Joliet, the 
Elmira Reformatory of New York, the New York Juvenile Asylum, and the Eastern 
Penitentiary of Pennsylvania. 
The main point in the interpretation of criminal statistics is to consider the ratio 
between the number of criminals furnished by a given number of illiterates as com- 
pared with a like number who can read and write. We must consider not only the 
numerators, but also the denominators of our fractions in order to get at the true 
value. 
But there are other important items which some future census taker will give us; 
for example, the number of persons who can read and write but who are so poorly 
equipped as to be very ignorant. In the statisties taken in the better class of our
-P-A-G-E-91
EDUCATION AND CRIME. 13831 
jails and prisons a good classification of prisoners prevails. In 1870 the illiterate 
and the very deficient amounted to 60 per cent of the prisoners according to the 
returns from New York and Pennsylvania; to 50 per cent in those from Minnesota, 
Towa, Kansas, and California; to 75 per cent in those from Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, 
Michigan, and Wisconsin; to 85 per cent in those of Maryland, Kentucky, and South 
Carolina. 
Many keep careful statistics in regard to previous condition of industry, the char- 
acter of parents, the time of leaving home, the state of health. A large proportion 
of criminals were orphans or have left home at a tender ages Many have been 
brought up by criminal parents; very many have never learned how to work at an 
honest and honorable occupation. 
The question of the prevention and cure of crime is a very complicated one, hay- 
ing many cooperative causes besides that of defect of schooling. But that schooling 
is a very powerful influence is made probable by these statistics, and it is made cer- 
tain, by considering its nature. 
Stated in a word, every school demands good behavior, and most teachers succeed 
in securing it. Good behavior means respect for the rights of others and regularity, 
punctuality, self-restraint, and industry at mastering the thought, or at least memor- 
izing the words, of learned and scientific men. It is this requirement of good behav- 
ior that secures the moral influence of the school. It is questionable whether set 
moral lessons produce the desired effect, but obedience to the rules of good order 
insures moral habits. 
This, of course, develops power of self-control. It gives power of inhibiting mere 
natural impulses and passions and of choosing higher motives. Even selfish motives 
become purified as they become more general in their scope and bearing, and a per- 
fectly wise selfishness would adopt the golden rule. 
To those who have objected to secular education as tending to fill our jails with 
educated criminals, the defenders of the schools have pointed significantly to the 
statistics of religious education among criminals which are beginning to be kept in a 
great number of jails and prisons. For instance, in the Detroit jail, in twenty-five 
years, there were reported 37,089 out of 40,838 as having religious training, against 
2,249 who had none. Of the religious influences, 15 had been under Mormon train- 
ing, 69 under Jewish, and the remaining 37,000 about equally under Protestant and 
Roman @atholic training. 
In the Elmira Reformatory, in twelve years, those reported as having no religious 
training were only 7 per cent; with Hebrew training, 5 per cent; with Protestant, 
42 per cent, and with Catholic, 46 per cent. 
In the reports from 200 jails in the United States, with about 55,000 prisoners last 
year (1892), in reply to an inquiry made by the Bureau of Education, over one-half 
reported religious training of prisoners; 10,376 with none; 9,934 with Protestant; 163 
with Jewish; 9,115 with Catholic training. 
I quote these facts to show how statistics may mislead a person who does not con- 
sider the qualitative as well as the quantitative side. 
It would be preposterous to think that the training of the church or the Sunday 
school could tend toward the production of criminals. The doctrine of self-sacrifice 
for others, the example of the Son of God who suffered, the perfect for the imper- 
fect; no one can conceive a more powerful lesson to distrain the youth from a 
criminal career. The Jewish instruction in the Ten Commandments would produce 
righteousness instead of crime. And yet the neophyte in statistics would say that 
the 92 per cent of criminals in Detroit who had received religious instruction made 
a bad showing for religious education. But he would say this only because he isa 
neophyte and omitted his denominator, like the bad arithmeticians who haye been 
decrying public education in the magazines and reviews and comparing numerators 
without a glance at their denominators. 
 
-P-A-G-E-92
  1332 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
The religious statistics would read when the denominators are applied somewhat 
as follows:* The 92 per cent of criminals who have had some religious instruction haye 
been.furnished by the 98 or 99 per cent of the whole population who have been 
under religious instruction, while the 8 per cent of criminals without previous 
religious teaching represent the 1 or 2 per cent of their class in Michigan. And 
none of the criminals came there through religious teaching, but because they neg- 
lected its counsels. 
The attack on school education as increasing the number of convicted criminals— 
an increase proved by the returns from the different States—has brought forward a 
new phase of the question. 
Educators will remember the brilliant attack led by Richard Grant White, some 
years ago, in the North American Review, and recently an article in the Popular 
Science Monthly, by Mr. Reece. These have been replied to, the former by Dr. 
Philbrick, in the North American Review, and by Prof. B. F. Tweed, in a yaluable 
pamphlet. That of Mr. Reece was well answered by Mr. H. H. Clayton, who 
quoted the interesting analysis of criminal records in Massachusetts, published by 
Mr. David C. Torrey, in Lend a Hand for January, 1890. 
Massachusetts, it was said, committed to its jails and prisons only 8,761 persons in 
1850, while in 1885 it committed 26,651, or nearly three times as many. In 1850 
only 1 person to 113 inhabitants; in 1885, 1 to 72. This evidently demanded a 
qualitative inquiry. What crimes are on the increase? Mr. Torrey classified them, 
first, under two heads, and found that the crimes against person and property were, 
on an average, from 1865 to 1870, 1 to 301 inhabitants, while from 1880 to 1885 they 
were 1 to 436, thus showing a decrease in serious crimes of 44 per cent. The second 
heading was commitments for crimes against order and decency, and these had 
increased largely. 
Investigation further into these crimes against order and decency, Mr. Torrey found 
that they were mostly cases of drunkenness. The commitments for drunkenness in 
1850 were only 3,341, while in 1885 they had risen to 18,701. The commitments for 
all other crimes than drunkenness in 1850 amounted to 1 for 183 inhabitants, and 
in 1885 to only 1 for 244 inhabitants. The average from 1850 to 1865 was 1 to 174 
inhabitants, while the average from 1870 to 1885 was 1 to 241 inhabitants, for other 
crimes than drunkenness. 
This showing completely turned the tables on that class of sensational or ernotional 
writers who deal with what I call hysterical statistics. Person and property have 
become more safe in Massachusetts. Between 1865 and 1885 commitments for crimes 
against them decreased 44 per cent, allowing for increase of population. The 
decrease was greatest in crimes against property, but there was a decided decrease of 
crimes against person. But while person and property have become safer in twenty- 
five years, drunkenness is not nearly so safe; the prisons and jails are crowded with 
intemperate people, who were formerly allowed to go unmolested through the streets 
and country roads. 
The fact that person and property have become more secure on the whole is very 
significant, when we consider the fact that the numerous cities of Massachusetts 
afford hiding places for burglars who raid on the small villages or the rural part of 
the State by night and escape to the city by railroad before morning. Any species 
of crime that goes unpunished tends to increase and to multiply criminals. Hence 
rural districts in the vicinity of the large cities of the Middleand Eastern States suffer 
more from this species of marauding than any other portion of the United States, 
not even excepting the borderland. 
Of the secular virtues, justice is particularly concerned in this matter of crime. It 
has two phases, honesty and truth speaking, that are particularly cultivated in good 
schools. Temperance is a virtue which the school helps to some extent. Fortitude 
is developed by self-restraint in the school. Prudence or providence is the special  
-P-A-G-E-93
  
  EDUCATION AND ORIME. ° 1333 
virtue of thrift, and the school nurtures this by increasing intelligence and skill in 
productive industry. ‘ 
On the question of the promotion of these virtues by the school, I desire to cite 
the statistics of thrift in fayor of the State that gives the largest amount of schooling 
to each inhabitant. 
It is surprising to the person who has not become familiar with the facts to learn 
that the total number of years’ schooling that each person on an average is getting 
in the United States is only four and three-tenths, nearly four years of this being 
furnished by public and less than six-tenths years by private schools. But the 
amount that Massachusetts is giving is six years and eighty-six hundredths, or two 
and one-half years more than the general average. There are only five States that 
give over six years on an ayerage to their whole population. These are, first, Mas- 
sachusetts, next New York, third Connecticut, fourth Ohio, fifth Rhode Island. 
The average for the whole nation is about equal to the primary school course of four 
years. 
I quote these statistics to point out a connection between education and industry. 
The total production of the labor of the people of the United States for 1880 was 
about 40 cents apiece per day for each man, woman, and child; but the production 
of Massachusetts, with its average of seven years of schooling for each inhabitant, 
was nearly double that of the ayerage for each inhabitant of the whole nation. I 
haye made on different bases three estimates, using the data given by Col. O. D. 
Wright in his census of the State for 1885. The lowest estimate gives 68 per cent 
more than the national average, the second 84 per cent, the third and best one 
exactly 100 per cent. The population of Massachusetts is 4 per cent and its produc- 
tion is 8 per cent of that of the whole nation. Who that looks at modern produc- 
tions of industry and considers how much of it is due to machinery, and considers 
further the dependence of machinery for its management on alert and educated 
intelligence, can fail to see the relation of the schools of Massachusetts to its phe- 
nomenal production of the items of wealth? 
The virtue of prudence or productive industry insures the existence of other vir- 
tues, such as temperance and honesty. For the fact that the people of a State have 
arrived at the stage of political conscience that they attack not only the crime, but 
also its source in such vice as intemperance, implies an advance also in regard to 
many virtues. And can not the well-kept schools claim a large share in producing 
these favorable moral conditions? 
  THE CURSE IN EDUCATION. 
[From an article by Rebecca Harding Davis in the North American Review for May, 1899.] 
The most urgent of rules—the one in which the American puts absolute faith—is 
“Educate; send every boy and girl to school.”’ 
It never occurs to the American that there can be a mistake or room for hesitancy 
here. * * * Educate a man, he says; teach him mathematics, chemistry, or 
what not, and he can take care of himself in the universe. It is this unspoken creed 
that has made the schoolhouse a fetish in the United States. Whether it stands in 
a village in New England, or in a Florida swamp, or in an Indian reservation, we all 
believe that a life-giving ichor goes out of it which will conquer not only ignorance, 
but poverty and crime. 
This idea came naturally enough to Uncle Sam when he found his gates besieged 
by hordes of ignorant Irish, Germans, Russians, Huns, and Italians, and within his 
gates other hordes of ignorant negroes and Indians. Their ignorance seemed to him 
the deadly disease which would destroy the nation. Cure that bya certain amount

  1384 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
of book learning, and the American would be the typical intelligent and moral citi- 
zen—a model for the world. 
Hence the public school. 
Has the public school done its work? Has education been always an unmixed 
blessing to America and Americans? 
This question can not be answered so easily and positively as loyal sons of the 
Republic may suppose. 
Two or three facts which come up in my memory seem to me to have a bearing 
on it. 
First. On the table before me lies the annual report for 1898 of the inspectors of 
the Eastern Penitentiary in Pennsylvania. Here is one item: Ninety-one convicts 
who were in the prison last year had served one or more terms before. Of these 
hardened offenders only nine were unable to read and write. Of eight no record 
had been: kept, but as the majority of them were forgers and counterfeiters they had 
evidently received some mental training. The remaining seyenty-four were all edu- 
cated, having attended school from two to nine years. 
Another fact: Three years after the opening of free schools in London a marked 
increase was noticed in the number of juvenile offenders in the city prisons and reform- 
atories. There was, too, achange in the kind of crimes committed bythem. Thenum- 
ber of boys and young men convicted of forgery, grand larceny, and intricate swindling 
schemes was more than doubled, while the number of sneak thieves, drunkards, and 
pickpockets was lessened by one-half. As years passed the proportion of educated 
criminals largely increased. 
‘Are we to understand, then,’ demanded a zealous humanitarian in Parliament, 
“that our graded schools are breeding houses of crime?”’ 
But this was too pessimistic aview. Education did not breed crime in the pupils; 
education only gave crime tools to use. The three R’s never begot a desire in the 
mind of a boy to work harm to his fellows, but finding the desire there already 
they taught him to forge a note instead of picking a pocket. Without education he 
tramped barefoot in the mire of the broad road that leads downward; with it he 
drove in a chariot, but on the self same road and to the same dark end. 
Again, about fifteen years ago, I was in a lonely corner of Louisiana—a district 
of pale green prairies sloping down to the Gulf, dotted with the half-cultivated farms 
of the French Acadians. There they had been since they left Acadia years before. 
An isolated, separate clan, they retained the character, the handicrafts, and the bits 
of homely, useful knowledge which they brought with them, and also the same utter 
ignorance of the outer world. Very few of them could read or write. The men 
tilled the fields on the shores of the black bayous which crept lazily through banks 
of purple and yellow fleurs-de-lis, and the women in their cabins wove the soft, gay 
cotton stuffs in which they all were clad. They had no railways, no schoolhouses, 
no bosses with schemes for making big fortunes, no politics, and no newspapers. 
For years there had not been a case from among them in the parish court of theft, 
or adultery, or murder. They worked enough to keep them from want. They went 
to mass in the morning and toa dance at night. They were faithful husbands, 
loyal friends, tender mothers, single-minded, honest, merry folk. What more 
would you have? 
When I went away from this Attakapas country and looked back at the great, 
dull green plain rolling down to the sea, with its pleasant farms and snug little 
homesteads gay with flowers, soft-floating gray mists now and then clouding the 
sunshine, it seemed the very land of peace. Surely its name should be Arcadia, 
not Acadie. 
A year later I heard a philanthropic Northern lecturer descant on the ignorance 
of this people, and beg for aid to ‘‘send the schoolmaster among them, to open the 
way for railways, business, and civilization.”
-P-A-G-E-95
EDUCATION AND ORIME. 1835 
Would not any intelligent American question seriously whether these people 
would be elevated or lowered in the actual scale of being by these things? * * * 
A still more tragic instance is the negro, who, as soon as he was freed, was taken 
out of the cabin of the slave field hand, not to be taught to read his Bible and earn 
his bread as a skilled mechanic, but to study the higher mathematics and Plato, 
French and German, medicine and law; and then, with contempt and insult, was 
denied the chance to use his knowledge. 
What, then, is wrong? Too much education? 
No. No sane man can doubt that to educate a human being so as to develop his 
individual capacity and to fit him for his especial place in life is the best thing we 
can do‘for him. It is a gift to him from his fellow-men, second only to that of life. 
But it must be given with wisdom and discrimination. * * * 
Into that aforesaid schoolhouse, of which we boast with such fervor, are going 
to-day countless legions of little Pats and Jans and Sambos—boys with a myriad dif- | 
fering capacities, tendencies, and destinies. And each is crammed with the same 
dose of unassimilated facts—the alphabets of a dozen sciences which he*never learns 
to put together into an intelligible word. Nothing more cruel and ridiculous was 
ever done in the world. It is the old story of the boys of Dotheboy’s Hall, who 
were ranged into a row while Mrs. Squeers ladied into each gaping mouth the same 
dose of treacle and sulphur. * * * 
Of course, we all know the seeret reason which prompts this American system of 
education. Every child must be prepared for any possible position. The boy who 
will end his days behind the counter of a village store, and who has no ambition nor 
qualification to do other work, must have his smattering of Greek and philosophy, 
because he may some day be Senator or President. The girl from X- » Who would 
be fitted for a full, happy life by a course in dressmaking or cookery and arithmetic, 
studies trigonometry and art. May she not, some day, be the first lady of the land? 
Dull, good young women by the tens of thousands, meant by nature to brood over 
homes and to mother children, and to teach them truth and honor and the love of 
God, grapple with the Semitic tongues or biology, with the hope that they will be 
club women or scholars, and train their sons for college. 
It is, as we all know, the chance for every man that constitutes the true greatness 
of America. But it is this chance also which is at the bottom of our discontent, of 
our vulgar pretension, of our intolerable rudeness, and of the false values which we 
are apt to place upon the things of life. Perhaps the falsest value is that which we 
set on mere book learning. Without religion, it only qualifies the thief to be more 
expert in his thieving. If it is not assimilated into a man’s life, and made a part of 
his everyday work, it becomes a deadly alien weight on both. 
When will Americans see that there is no blessing like the education which we 
can use, but that the education which we can not use is a curse?   
ERRONEOUS INTERPRETATION OF PRISON STATISTICS. 
[Interview with the United States Commissioner of Education, reprinted from the Brooklyn (N. Y.) 
Eagle, October 8, 1899.] 
Much comment has been occasioned by an article in a recent number of the North 
American Review, written by Rebecca Harding Davis, in which she makes some 
sharp and caustic remarks about the relations of education and crime. The writer 
takes a very doleful view of the matter and by reference to the number of persons 
in jail able to read and write attempts to prove that education has served to increase 
the amount of crime. She even goes so far as to intimate that the graded schools 
are breeding places for crime and explains the large number of old maids in New 
England and other portions of the country as the natural result of their disinclina-  
-P-A-G-E-96
  1836 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
tion to marry men of moderate means after having received an academic course of 
instruction. 
The article is a forceful one and has caused widespread notice and criticism. While 
many people disagree with Mrs. Davis in her gloomy conclusions, no facts have been 
produced to disprove her contentions. Commissioner of Education Harris, however, 
is prepared to take issue with her, and in an interview with the Eagle correspondent 
to-day he presented an array of arguments and statistics on the opposite side. He 
believes that Mrs. Davis has made her assertions without a fair and full considera- 
tion of all the features of the case, and is not willing to admit that education helps to 
increase the total number of pickpockets, forgers, or other criminals. When Com- 
missioner Harris was asked to-day what he had to say of the statement of Mrs. Davis 
that our graded schools are breeding houses of crime, he replied: 
“Tf the statistics on both sides of this question are considered, I think most peo- 
ple will believe our schools do not swell the number of criminals of the country, but, 
on the contrary, exert just the opposite tendency. Communities that send a very 
large part of their population into schools haye a higher ideal as to what is consid- 
ered lawful and decent behavior in public. They are not content with punishing 
crimes against person and property, but often arrest persons for drunkenness and 
other vices. There was a time in Boston when a person seen in the streets smoking 
acigar would be liable to arrest by a policeman. A multitude of penalties on the 
statute books, such as arrest for plucking a flower on the public common or crossing 
the grass from one gravel walk to another, increase the number of arrests every 
year, but do not necessarily imply an increase of serious crime. Counting the per- 
sons in jail in the United States, it is found that the quota of the illiterate is nearly, 
or quite, eight times as much as the quota from an equal number of persons who can 
read and write. For instance, the statistics of the Detroit jail for its first twenty- 
five years show 40,338 committals, of whom 11,686 could not write. In the total 
population of the State less than 5 per cent were illiterates. Five per cent, therefore, 
furnished 11,686 committals and the other 95 per cent of the population furnished 
28,652. In other words, the illiterates furnished eight times their quota of criminals 
for the jail. The report of the Detroit jail for 1887 contains the statistics on this 
subject.’’ 
“How about the statement of Mrs. Davis that the number of juvenile offenders in 
London was greatly increased after the establishment of the London free schools in 
1870?” 
“T have before me,’’ replied Commi mer Harris, ‘two articles on this subject, 
one in the London School Board Chronicle for April 16, 1898, and the other in the 
London Schoolmaster for November 6, 1897. The average daily number of persons 
in the jail in England and Wales is given for thirty-four years, and a study of them 
will reyeal the true facts regarding the point touched on by Mrs. Davis. There was 
a marked decrease of crime from 1870 to 1894. The schools had scarce begun to have 
any effect upon the total in 1870, but in that year there were 128 persons in jail out 
of every 100,000 of the population. Ten years later the 128 had decreased to 111 in 
each 100,000 population, and in 1890 this had fallen off nearly one-half. Instead of 
111 there were only 68 in prison out of a population of 100,000. It has been stated 
that the school educates the intellect, but does not affect the morals. Nearly all the 
schools of this country and in England lay more stress on good behavior than they 
do upon learning lessons. In fact, some schools with poor methods of instruction, in 
spite of that, do a great deal of good, because they teach children how to behave in 
public. By insisting on regularity, punctuality, silence, and industry in the school- 
room they secure a quality of self-control on the part of the pupils which no other 
means can accomplish so well. I do not find it strange, therefore, that the effect of 
the school shows itself in the morals of the community still more than it does in the 
quickening of the intellect. People in England who are studying this matter seem ” 
 
-P-A-G-E-97
EDUCATION AND CRIME. 1337 
to think that the great falling off of criminals in the jails, namely, from 128 in every 
100,000 in 1880 to only 68 in every 100,000 in 1890, is due to the wholesome effect of 
the schools. Quite extensive investigations were made in 1870 by the Bureau -of 
Education on the same lines. The prisons and jails of 17 States, 14 of them being 
Western or Middle States, reported 110,538 prisoners. Of these 27,581, or almost . 
exactly 25 per cent, were illiterates. Attention being called to the fact that three- 
fourths of the prisoners could read and write and had had some schooling, the same 
claim now put forth by Mrs. Davis was made—that education promotes crime. The 
conclusion was drawn that the schools were ‘breeding houses of crime.’ Butin this 
case the numerators were compared and the denominators neglected, for in the 17 
States the average illiteracy of the population was about 4 per cent. This 4 per 
cent of the population furnished 25 per cent of the criminals, and the 96 per cent 
who could read and write furnished only 75 percent. The illiterates, therefore, fur- 
nished more than six times their quota, while those who could read and write sup- 
plied one-fifth less than their proper quota. Thus, 1,000 illiterates furnished on an 
average eight times as many prisoners as the same number who could read and write. 
It seems to me that if the discipline of a common school which trains the pupil from 
day to day in the habit of self-control and respect for the rights of others will not 
produce law-abiding citizens nothing else is likely to accomplish it.” 
“What would be the effect of school training on other evil habits outside of the 
list of schoolroom virtues—regularity, punctuality, silence, etc.?”’ 
“The school impresses upon the pupil the constant necessity of considering the 
ideal of good behavior, and the boy in school for many months in the year acquires 
this as a habit; it becomes second nature. Of course, a person who has acquired the 
habit of regulating his conduct by an ideal must carry this habit into the whole 
range of his life and modify it to some advantage. Education is far from stimulating 
evil instincts, but on the contrary serves to suppress them. One of the English 
writers to whom I referred collected the police statistics as well as the jail statistics, 
and found that in 1870, while there were 31,225 thieves in jail, there were 50,144 
running at large, but known to be thieves by the police. These two items make a 
total of 81,369, but in 1895 those in jail had decreased from 31,225 to 18,365, and 
those reported as at large had decreased to 18,033, making a total of 36,398 in 1895, 
as against 81,369 in 1870. In the meantime the population of England and Wales 
had increased from 23,000,000 to 30,000,000. This reduction by one-half of the 
number of suspicious cases and in jail in the face of a big increase in population is 
certainly an indication of the good effects of education. These statistics are of value 
because they show the state of the whole community, and not merely the number 
actually convicted and imprisoned. An interesting record has been made in Massa- 
chusetts regarding the relation of the jail population to illiteracy. Massachusetts 
gives more years of schooling on an average to its population than any other State. 
It has been claimed that Massachusetts overeducates its children. I have heard this 
charge, but you have only to consider the average amount of schooling to each 
inhabitant in order to see that the State does not overdo the matter of education. 
Massachusetts gives about seven years, of two hundred days each, on an average, to 
each one of its pupils, but the average for the whole United States is only five years. 
The average is not enough to take the pupil through the course of study in the ordinary 
district school. In 1850 there were 8,761 persons in the jails and common prisons of 
Massachusetts, while in 1885 the number had increased to 26,651, nearly three times 
as many as in 1850. This occasioned the remark that with the increase in education 
crime increased in a still greater degree. An analysis of the crimes reported, how- 
ever, showed that those against person and property had decreased during that period. 
Serious crimes had decreased 40 per cent, while the offenses against order and decency, 
being more vigilantly prosecuted, produced the enormous increase in the total num- 
ber. For example, in 1850 there were 3,341 commitments for drunkenness, but in  
-P-A-G-E-98
1338 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
1885 there were 18,701 commitments for this offense. The commitments for all 
other crimes than drunkenness in 1850 amounted to one for each 183 inhabitants, and 
in 1885 one to each 244 inhabitants. This showing turned the tables on that class of 
sensational writers who deal with hysterical statistics. Person and property have 
become more safe in Massachusetts in the past fifty years, but drunkenness is more 
dangerous to the drunkard. 
“What do you think of the statement that education gives young people a disgust 
for manual labor?”’ 
“T do not think this charge is borne out by statistics. There is no country in the 
world in which young people are more ambitious to get into occupations in which 
they can earn a livelihood than the United States. In fact, the hunger for work is too 
great for the good of our youth. Again, those youths who get the greatest amount 
of schooling furnish the most productive populations; as, for instance, Massachusetts, 
with its seven years as schooling for each boy and girl, produces in manufacture, 
commerce, and agriculture an aggregate of wealth per inhabitant which is nearly 
twice that of the average product of the nation. In 1880 this product was from 70 
to 80 cents pes day for each inhabitant, while that for the country at large was only 
40 cents. Of course the educated person wishes to save his hands by the employ- 
ment of machines, and is not so willing to perform mere drudgery by hand when he 
can see methods of performing it by machines, but in the number of hours that he © 
works per day and in the intensity with which he works he excels the illiterate 
laborer. A man of education does one day’s work at his office and frequently does 
another day’s work when he gets home for the evening. In regard to the declaration 
that education for women gives them a distaste for marriage with men of moderate 
means, and therefore increases the number of old maids, I can only say that I do 
not wonder that an educated woman is more particular about the kind of husband 
she gets than an illiterate. Then, again, a woman with an academic training can 
afford to be independent to a certain degree. In closing I would like to quote these 
words by famous English authorities on the general subject of education and crime. 
Sir George Kekewich, the head of the parliamentary school board for England and 
Wales, says: } 
“<Every time I hear of a new school being opened I say to myself, ‘There goes 
another prison.””’ Sir John Gorst, one of the parliamentary leaders, says: ‘Every 
pound spent on the education of the young saves many pounds in the increased 
efficiency of the working population in the absence of the necessity for further jails 
and workhouses.’’

INFLUENCE OF THE SCHOOLS IN FRANCE. 
[Letter of the United States Commissioner of Education, October 14, 1899, to Prof. E. C. Branson, State 
Normal School, Athens, Ga] 
* * * T send you the following figures, made from the most recent French census, 
namely: 
1, From 1878 to 1895 there was an increase in the proportion of conscripts able to 
read, namely, from 84.7 per cent at the earlier date to 94.6 per cent at the later date, 
or an absolute increase of 11.6 per cent. 
2. From another source of information we learn that the number of newly mar- 
ried persons able to sign the certificate made the following increase from 1880 to 
1890: Men, from 84 per cent up to 91.6 per cent, an absolute increase of 9 per cent; 
for women, an increase from 75 per cent at the earlier date to 87.4 per cent, namely, 
an absolute increase of 16} per cent. 
3. With regard to convictions for crime between the years 1876 and 1892, a period 
 
-P-A-G-E-99
  EDUCATION AND CRIME. 1839 
of sixteen years, there was a decrease from 3,236 convictions in 1876 to 2,775 in 
1892, the same being a decrease of 14} per cent. 
4. From 1892 to 1896 there was a decrease of convictions from 2,775 in 1892 to 
2,464 in 1896, the same being a decrease of 11.2 per cent. 
5. For the entire period from 1876 to 1896, a period of twenty years, the decrease 
reads as follows: From 3,236 in 1876 to 2,464 in 1896, the same being a decrease of 
772, or 23.8 per cent. 
6. The crimes considered in this are homicide (including, under this, assassination, 
murder, parricide, poisoning), rape of minors, and thefts and breaches of trust. A 
large class of crimes that come under the head of assault and battery are omitted 
from this, and as the statistics for the rest of the crimes are very complicated, I have 
not yet collected them from the census report. For these items see the Réyvue Péda- 
gogique for May, 1899, and compare it with the extensive report on the prisons of 
France, by the minister of the interior, ‘‘Statistique Pénitentiaire,”’ for the year 1894. 
7. Another item which has been obtained is valuable in this connection, namely, 
of the prisoners included in the figures above given who were between the ages of 
16 and 21, there was for the entire period a decrease of 30.4 per cent for men and of 
43.4 per cent for women. For all, a decrease of 36.6 per cent, as against the 23 per 
cent above quoted for all criminals. This, of course, relates to the youth that have 
been under the influence of the schools. 
8. For the youthful criminals of 16 years of age and under convicted of the crimes 
above there was a decrease on the part of the boys of 43.3 per cent, and on the part 
of the girls of 62.5 per cent, or for both boys and girls a decrease of 50 per cent. 
This is very significant because of the fact that these persons are young enough to 
haye received the full influence of the schools. 
I hope at some time to be able to collect together all of the separate details of 
crimes against person and property. But the present figures with reference to all 
the more important items are very significant and refute the statement with regard 
to the increase of serious crimes since the Government schools of France have caused 
a decrease of illiteracy. 
It will be very clear, even from these figures, that the increase of crimes, if there is 
any such increase, is to be found in the minor crimes, and that it is probably due to 
officiousness on the part of the French police, who are seeking to carry out new 
regulations that have to do with vice rather than with crime. Persons and property 
are very much safer in France than they were twenty years ago.

CHAPTER XXIX. 
EDUCATION IN CANADA. 
Dominion of Canada, comprising seven provinces, with an extent of 3,653,946 square 
miles and a population estimated in 1897 at 5,185,900. 
Previous articles on education in Canada in the Commissioner’s Reports: 
Education in Ontario, Report 1892-93, Vol. 1, Chapter VI. Notes on education at 
the Columbian Exposition, ibid., Chapter X, pages 1213-1215. Manitoba school 
question, Report 1894-95, Vol. 1, Chapter VII. ‘ 
Current and historical survey of the systems of education in the several provinces. 
Report 1897-98, Vol. 1, Chapter IV. 
Topical outline.—Chief features of the systems of public education: Central and local 
control, sources of income, statistics of elementary schools (current and compara- 
tive)—Statistics of universities and colleges—University notes—Current discus- 
sions and criticisms—Movement to promote technical and industrial education— 
Existing provision for technical instruction in Ontario—Foundation and original 
provisions of the Ontario system of education. 
By the British North American act of 1867 the right to legislate on matters 
respecting education was left to the governments of the four provinces, which were 
then united under the general name of Dominion of Canada. The same right is 
assured also to the provinces that have since entered the confederation. 
All the provinces have established public schools corresponding to the elementary 
and high schools of our own States. The control of the schools is vested in central 
and in local authorities. In Ontario the central authority predominates; in the other 
provinces the local authorities have more independent action. Elementary schools 
are secular in all the provinces excepting Ontario and Quebec. In Ontario provision 
is made for separate schools for Protestants and for Roman Catholics where desired. 
The latter enrolled 8.6 per cent of the total pupils in 1898; the former an insignifi- 
cant proportion, less than two-tenths of 1 per cent. The vast majority of the pupils, 
above 91 per cent, were in the nonsectarian public schools. 
In Quebec the schools are sectarian, and provision is made for the separate con- 
trol of Roman Catholic and Protestant schools; the former in 1896-97 enrolled 86.6 
per cent of allelementary pupils. A single superintendent has general charge of the 
dual system, but he is assisted by a council of public instruction organized since 1869 
in two committees, one for the charge of Roman Catholic, the other for the charge 
of Protestant schools. 
In the Northwest Territories provision is made for separate schools for religious 
minorities (Protestant or Roman Catholic). The rate payers establishing these sep- 
arate or sectarian schools are relieved of taxes for the public schools. 
Tuition fees are charged in Quebec, but may not be more than 40 cents nor less 
than 5 cents a month. In the remaining provinces the public schools are free, 
excepting the high schools of Ontario, in which fees are paid. 
ED 99—VOL IL 85 1345  
-P-A-G-E-106
1346 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
Local authorities.—The municipal system of Ontario is admirably adapted to the 
maintenance of local self-government. The Province is divided into counties, which 
are subdivided into minor municipalities. These consist of townships, incorporated 
villages, towns, and cities. The municipal councils have certain powers and respon- 
sibilities in respect to education. Through their municipal councils the counties 
must make grants of money for high schools, and both counties and townships grants 
of money for public or elementary schools. Every township is subdivided into 
school sections, corresponding to a school district in our States, each of which must 
be provided with a public school. Every incorporated village, town, and city forms 
a school district. In each of these districts the rate payers (that is, the persons who 
pay a property tax) elect a board of school trustees, men and women being equally 
eligible to the positions. These trustees appoint the teachers, who must have a Goy- 
ernment diploma, and determine the amounts to be expended for buildings, equip- 
ments, and salaries. 
The local unit of school administration in Quebec is a school municipality, i. e., 
any territory erected into a municipality for the support of schools under the control 
of school commissioners or of trustees elected by those who pay a property tax (rate 
payers). The commissioners are empowered to divide a municipality into school 
districts and to maintain one or two schools in each district. 
The school law provides that— 
“Tf in any municipality the regulations and arrangements made by the school 
commissioners for the management of any school are not agreeable to any member 
whatever of the proprietors, occupants, tenants, or ratepayers professing a religious 
faith different from that of the majority of the inhabitants of such municipality, 
such proprietors, occupants, tenants, and ratepayers may signify such dissent in 
writing to the chairman of the commissioners. 
“The notice having been duly served, the dissentients may proceed, after the 
lapse of two weeks, to elect three school trustees, who will have the same power 
with respect to dissentient or separate schools as the commissioners have with respect 
to the schools of the majority. The trustees alone have the right of imposing and 
collecting the taxes upon the dissentient inhabitants.” 
In New Brunswick the school district is the local unit of school administration, 
and the elementary schools are managed. directly by trustees elected as in the other 
provinces. 
Noya Scotia maintains a system of free nonsectarian public schools under the gen- 
eral charge of the executive council, which forms for this special interest a council 
of public instruction. 
The province is divided into school commissioners’ districts, in charge each of a 
board of commissioners appointed by the council, subject to the provisions of the 
town’s incorporation act of 1895. Each school section has a board of three school 
trustees elected by the majority of the qualified voters of the section. The powers 
and duties imposed upon the trustees are discharged by the appointed commissioners 
in incorporated towns. 
The Manitoba school law of 1890 provides for the formation, alteration, and union 
of school districts in rural municipalities, and in cities, towns, and villages, and for 
the election of trustees in each district. 
In British Columbia the local unit of school administration is the district. School 
trustees elected by vote of persons who pay a property tax are empowered to pro- 
vide sufficient accommodation for all children of the district between 6 and 16 
years of age, inclusive. 
The system of public schools in the Northwest Territories is under the control of a 
council of public instruction comprising 4 members of the executive committee and 
4 appointed members, of whom 2 must be Protestants and 2 Roman Catholics. The 
appointed members have no yote, their duties being purely advisory. A school dis-  
-P-A-G-E-107
  EDUCATION IN CANADA. 1347 
trict must not exceed in area 25 square miles and must contain not less than 4 resi- 
dent taxpayers (property tax) and at least 12 children of school age. Each district 
elects school trustees, who manage the local school affairs. 
SOURCES OF INCOME, 
Ontario.—Provincial grant and local taxes. The provincial grant for education 
comprises (1) grants to elementary schools, (2) grants to secondary schools, (3) 
grants for the training of teachers, (4) grants for technical education. By statute 
the amount appropriated for public and for separate Roman Catholic or Protestant 
schools is divided on the basis of average attendance in each, respectively. 
In 1897 the legislative grant for elementary schools was $366,538, and the income 
from local sources $4,621,617. 
Quebec.—Provincial grant, local taxes, and fees. In 1898 the expenditure by the 
government for elementary schools was $170,000, and by the people $1,425,986. Of 
the amount appropriated by the government $20,000 was a special fund for poor 
districts. 
New Brunswick.—Provincial grant, county fund, and district assessment. The 
income from these several sources in 1898 was, respectively, $163,022, $90,807, 
$230,000. 
Nova Scotia.—The fixed sum of $182,500 for each school year is paid semiannually, 
or as the council of public instruction may prescribe, to legally qualified teachers 
employed in the common schools in accordance with law, to be divided between 
such teachers in conjoined proportion to the number of days the respective schools 
are taught and the scale of the respective grades. The school law provides further 
that ‘“‘in every county (except that in which the city of Halifax is situate) the 
clerk of the municipality is required to add to the sum annually voted for general 
municipal purposes at the regular meeting of the council a sum sufficient, after 
deducting costs of collection and probable loss, to yield an amount equal to 30 cents 
for every inhabitant of the municipality, according to the last census preceding the 
issue of the rate-roll, and the sum so added shall form or bea portion of the munici- 
pal rates. The sum thus raised shall be paid annually by the treasurer upon the 
order of the superintendent of education. Any sum further needed is determined 
by the majority of those who pay a property tax (rate-payers) and is raised by a 
poll-tax, and further, if necessary, by a levy on the real and personal property and 
incomes of the residents of the section. Ordained ministers and unmarried women 
are exempt from sectional assessment on property to the amount of $500. 
Special appropriations are annually made from provincial and county funds toward 
the support of schools in poor sections. The amounts appropriated for this purpose 
jn 1897 were, from the general government, $4,308; from county funds, $3,762. 
Prince Edward Island.—Provincial grant and district assessment. In 1898 the 
* former yielded 79.63, the latter 20.37 per cent of the school income. 
Manitoba.—Proyincial grant and district assessment. 
British Columbia.—Provyincial grant. 
Northwest Territories.—Provincial grant and local taxes. The former is distributed 
among the schools on the basis of average attendance, at the rate of $1.50 per 
capita; number of days in session, at the rate of $1.40 a day for a term not to exceed 
two hundred and ten days; the graded certificate held by the teacher, 10 or.20 
cents a day for an annual term of two hundred and ten days, and the grade assigned 
to the school on the report of the government inspector, at not less than 5 cents nor 
more than 15 cents a day for an annual session not exceeding two hundred and ten 
days. 
Education is compulsory in all the provinces excepting Quebec, but complaint is 
urged that no provision is made for the enforcement of compulsion.

bBy a clerical oversight the enrollment in Roman Catholic separate schools, 41,620, was omitted 
from table given in Commissioner’s Report for 1897- 98 (see vol. 2, table, pp. 170; also 2616.) c Also 70,417 in model schools and academies which include elementary departments.

From column 6 of the above table it will be seen that the increase 
in enrollment during the decade 1887-88 to 1897-98 was much greater 
in the more newly settled provinces than in the older provinces, and 
that in the former it increased enormously during the period. A 
better idea of the relative amount of school attendance is obtained 
from the consideration of the ratio of enrollment to population as 
shown below:

By comparing column 6 of the above table with the corresponding 
column in the table of enrollment it will be seen that in the provinces 
for which the data for comparison are available, the increase in average 
attendance during the decade 1888-1898 was much greater than the 
increase in enrollment. This impliesimprovement in all the conditions 
that make for efficient schools. The ratios of average attendance to 
enrollment at the beginning and end of the decade were as follows:

UNIVERSITY NOTES. 
The University of Manitoba was founded in 1877 and received from 
the provincial government a prospective endowment of 150,000 acres, 
of which it came into actual possession during the current year (1899). 
The grant of a site for the erection of a building has further increased 
the favorable outlook of the university. The university was organ- 
ized originally as an examining body, but teaching functions have 
since. been included. As it is the only degree-conferring institution 
in the province, all colleges are brought into intimate relations with it. 
Of this feature a writer in the Winnipeg Free Press says: 
t was a great experiment to gather the religious denominations into one common 
fold, and to lay down the principle that but one source of degrees in arts, medicine, 
Jaw, and theology should exist in Manitoba. It was a ‘‘consummation devoutly to be 
wished,’’ even if self-denial, difficulty, and at times disappointment were involved. 
in its maintenance. 
The most superficial observer may, however, see that the colleges have been the 
life of the university. Two of them, St. Boniface and St. John’s, bring with them 
the best traditions of the old Red River days. Two of them, Manitoba and Wesley, 
are of post-confederation date. The college of Esculapius, bearing its symbol of 
vigor, has now reached a stable place in its history, and it is but just to mention the 
three excellent collegiate institutes of Winnipeg, Brandon, and Portage la Prairie. 
All of these institutions have cheerfully and earnestly given the time of their profes- 
sors and teachers to do the work of the university. 
The existence of our provincial university is a matter to us of congratulation, but 
perhaps we do not fully appreciate its importance as the crown of the educational 
pyramid of Manitoba. The university gives the tone and direction to the educational 
development of the country. Those provinces of the Dominion that have a strong 
and united university life are those that have the best systems of public-school 
instruction, both primary and secondary. The elevation of the standard for teach- 
ers is only possible when the facilities for higher education are good. It is a great 
matter to have the assistance of men of university standing and broader training to 
guide the affairs of the lower schools. It has certainly been an advantage to the 
school system of Manitoba that 6 out of the 8 members of the advisory board that 
directs public-school education are active members of the university council. The 
large infusion of university trained teachers in our public schools has introduced a 
much higher standard of culture into our schoolrooms than would haye been other- 
wise possible. 
A considerable band of earnest students, the prospect of ample means of accom- 
modation, such as buildings, laboratories, and apparatus, being given, the question of 
most pressing importance is, What are our facilities for teaching? The proposal at 
the present time is to have under the act of 1893 a joint professoriate, a part supplied 
by the colleges and a part by the university. The terms of the act are that there 
may be in the university professors of natural sciences, mathematics, and modern lan- 
guages. A committee of the university is now charged to make with the provincial 
government arrangements for as much as may be possible in this direction. Natural 
science and very soon mathematics may be taken by the university. Probably in 
the meantime modern languages will be left to the colleges, along with classics and
-P-A-G-E-113
  
EDUCATION IN CANADA. 1353. 
mental and moral sciences. - This plan of a joint university and college professoriate 
is that followed in Cambridge and Oxford in England and in Toronto University. ~ 
There seems some reason in this apart from its financial aspect. The colleges all 
have faculties of theology. To them the teaching of Latin, and especially Greek, is 
necessary for those who are to be devotees of the ‘‘Queen of all the Sciences.’”’ To 
theology also it is of first importance that its cultivators should be logicians and phi- 
losophers. Classics, then, and philosophy, as being cognate subjects with theology, 
may well be taught in the theological colleges. In the meantime modern languages 
would also thus be cared for. 
But, whether in college or university, the band of teachers must be looked on as 
one—one in aim and so, also, in spirit. That higher education may be advanced, 
the arrangement must be heartily entered upon if the highest good is to be done. 
Presuming that the line of action thus laid out is to be that which will be followed 
for a number of years to come, it is plain that the colleges have certain other most 
important functions in our system. They are given an individuality under our con- 
stitution of a most marked kind. To me it is a most important feature of these 
colleges that they all have residences for the students. The residential system is a 
part of the English university system. It has, to my mind, a great advantage over 
the Scottish and German system of students living in private lodgings all over the 
city. The residence system, which seems to have been a failure in Toronto University, 
is a very marked feature of our Winnipeg college life. It produces a strong esprit 
du corps in the college. College men form here lifelong friendships. They learn 
to bear with the failings of their fellow students, and they receive great impulse and. 
assistance from their associates. Both in my student and professorial experience a 
large percentage of the best workers and most successful students have been students: 
in residence. The hard worker aiways has his rights respected, and can have all the 
privacy he desires, for it is a point of honor even among the greatest triflers to ayoid 
disturbing the man who ‘‘fags.”’ 
The fact that the arts colleges are each under the direction of some religious body 
gives them a special opportunity to exercise a kind, wise, and watchful care oyer the 
young men who are committed to their charge. The atmosphere of a religious life 
may ever be found in a college; its morning and evening prayers, religious opening, 
and other influences freely exercised supply a most valuable factor in the training 
and development of the students. This feature will be most helpful in supplying a 
side of university education. 
Coeducation at Dathousie College.—Dalhousie College was founded 
in 1819, but did not begin active operations for nearly twenty years 
afterwards. From that time until 1881 only male students entered. 
Then two ambitious young women asked to be admitted. The author- 
ities of the college were inclined to refuse their applications, but as 
there was nothing in the character of the college to exclude women, 
a more liberal policy prevailed and the two girls were enrolled as stu- 
dents of Dalhousie. Only one of them finished her course. 
In 1882 another woman student entered, and graduated in 1886 with 
the degree of B. §., with honors in mathematics and mathematical 
physics. In 1887 three women were graduated. Last year five took 
the B. A. degree, and the catalogue shows about the same number this 
year. Besides the regular undergraduate students a large number of 
young women attend certain courses which are open to them.

CURRENT DISCUSSIONS. 
In all the Canadian Provinces there is unusual activity at this time 
in respect to public education, and in the two leading Provinces there 
is widespread criticism of the existing systems. 
In Ontario complaint is made of a tendency to excessive centraliza- 
tion, and the demand is heard for greater freedom in respect to the 
internal conduct of schools, especially those of secondary grade. 
The situation as regards the secondary schools was very fully dis- 
cussed in the annual meeting of the Ontario Educational Association. 
The following points were especially urged: That the curriculum 
should be specialized to meet the demands of the three distinct classes 
of students in the high schools, viz, those who are studying for the 
university and professions; those who are preparing to be teachers, and 
those who are merely seeking general training; that the pressure of 
examinations should be lightened; that greater freedom should be left 
to the teachers. The sense of the meeting was recorded in the follow- 
ing resolution, which was carried by a vote practically unanimous: 
Resolution.—‘‘ That this meeting is of the opinion that the undue 
influence of uniformity, aggravated by too frequent changes, is the 
cause of grave evils in the matter of secondary education.” 
The system of departmental examinations has been gradually 
extended until, it is urged, they have an effect upon the whole work 
of education entirely out of proportion to their real value. This com- — 
plaint has led already to a revision of the university matriculation 
examination with a view to lessening its strain upon secondary pupils. 
The school boards of Toronto, Guelph, and Hamilton have resolved 
to do away with examinations for promotion in the grade schools, and 
to promote pupils on the recommendations of their teachers, based 
upon the work of the year. 
Among other questions widely discussed is that of increasing the 
proportion of men teachers in the schools. They form now but 32 
per cent of the total number, and the ratio is continually decreasing. 
In view of these discussions and demands it is interesting to review 
the main features of the Ontario system, which will remain essentially 
unimpaired whatever modifications of detail may be adopted. Sucha 
review is afforded by the preface to the sixth volume of the Docu- 
mentary History of Education in Upper Canada, by Mr. J. George 
Hodgins, deputy minister of education, which is appended to this 
report. (See pp. 1361-65.) 
The system of education in Quebec is characterized by provision 
for the separate control of Catholic and Protestant schools and by a 
high degree of local independence. A bill was submitted to the legis- 
lative assembly of 1897 providing for a secular system under the 
control of a minister of education. The measure was carried in the
-P-A-G-E-115
EDUCATION IN CANADA. 1355 
assembly, but rejected by the legislative council. Subsequent efforts 
to revive this measure have failed, and a bill has been substituted 
which proposes no radical departure from the existing system. —~ 
MOVEMENT TO PROMOTE TECHNICAL AND INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION, 
The disciission of the systems of education in the Canadian Prov- 
inces is accompanied with a widespread agitation of the subject of 
industrial and technical education. The movement for provision in 
this respect began in Ontario in 1870 with the establishment of a tech- 
nical college, since developed into the School of Practical Science. 
During the last fifteen years the Government has fostered training in 
industrial art by means of certificates, medals, grants in aid of art 
schools, and art exhibitions. Commercial courses have been intro- 
duced into the high schools, and more recently efforts have been made 
to provide for instruction in domestic science and in agriculture in the 
public schools. Provision for manual training is advocated by the 
department, and the city of Kingston has already introduced the 
branch. 
It is generally recognized that the time has come for systematizing 
and extending this work, and as a preliminary measure the deputy 
minister of education, Mr. John Millar, B. A., has made an investi- 
gation of the systems of technical and industrial training in this 
country, chiefly in Massachusetts, and submitted a very full report on 
the subject. The recommendations of Mr. Millar with respect to tech- 
nical education at the high-school stage are cited at the end of this 
article. They are based largely upon his observations in the United 
States. 
The subject of technical education is vigorously agitated in Quebec 
also. Here the schools of the Christian Brothers afford admirable 
examples of the methods of combining industrial with general 
education. 
An impetus has been given to the whole movement by the offer of 
Sir William C. McDonald, whose liberal benefactions to McGill Univer- 
sity, amounting to $2,500,000, have already proved his interest in the 
cause of public education. He now proposes to equip a manual-train- 
ing schoolin a suitable center in each Province, and to provide for the 
maintenance of these schools for a period of three years. 
The following statements from the report of Hon. G. W. Ross, for 
1898, give particulars of the existing provision for technical training: 
TECHNICAL EDUCATION, PUBLIC AND FREE LIBRARIES, ART SCHOOLS, AND LITERARY AND 
SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS. 
The annual report of the superintendent of this branch of the educational depart- 
ment is very encouraging. It shows that the legislation during the past four years 
for the improvement of free and public libraries has been appreciated by the people 
throughout the whole province,
-P-A-G-E-116
1356 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
The act of 1895 changed the name of mechanics’ institutes to public libraries, and 
provided for establishing free libraries either by direct incorporation or by transferring 
mechanics’ institutes, libraries, and reading rooms to the municipal councils of cities, 
towns, and villages. The annual legislative grant for the purchase of books was 
then divided as follows, viz, $200 for cities, $150 for towns, and $100 for villages. 
In 1896 an amendment to the act was passed increasing the legislative grant for 
the purchase of books to $200 per annum for every public library established under 
the act; also empowering municipal and school corporations to contribute to the 
maintenance of public libraries. 
In 1898 an amendment to the act was passed for establishing free libraries in police 
villages. 
The results are very gratifying, showing that the liberal grants, $46,000 per annum, * 
voted by the legislature for public libraries, have been well expended, imparting 
valuable information and opening up new avenues of thought to our young people 
and their parents in the remotest parts of our province. (See Abstract No. 1, giving 
number of libraries in each county and district. ) 
The free-library system has been very successful. In 1895 we had only 12 free 
libraries. There are now 103 free libraries reporting, and several others have been 
established since Ist of January, 1899. 
In 1883 we had 93 libraries, with 13,672 members, who borrowed 251,890 books; 
while in 1898, 347 libraries reported haying 111,208 readers, who borrowed 2,358,140 
volumes. In addition, for 1898 we may add 27 libraries which did not send in their 
returns in time for this report, and 10 new libraries incorporated since the Ist of 
May, 1898, making a total of 384 libraries for 1898. 
During the same period (1883 to 1898) 16,297,033 volumes have been issued, and 
$1,903,115 expended for public and free libraries, and the assets have increased from 
$255,190 to $870,167. ART SCHOOLS, ETC. 
During the past fifteen years considerable attention has been paid to art education. 
We have endeavored to develop a taste for industrial drawing as the basis of indus- 
trial education, now universally acknowledged an important factor in the national 
wealth and prosperity of every country in which it has been adopted. 
During the past fifteen years the education department has awarded to the pupils 
and students of art schools, ladies’ colleges, ete., 51,712 proficiency certificates, and 
2,562 full certificates in the primary course, which includes free-hand, model, and 
blackboard drawing, and primary geometry and perspective; 3,746 proficiency certifi- 
cates, and 196 full certificates in the advanced course, which includes shading from 
the flat and round, outline from the round, drawing from flowers, and industrial 
design; 1,107 proficiency certificates and 89 full certificates in the mechanical course, 
including advanced geometry and perspective, machine drawing, building construc- 
tion, and architectural design; 286 certificates in the industrial art course, which 
includes modeling in clay, wood carying, lithography, and painting on china; 1,245 
certificates for extra subjects, including oil and water-color painting, etc. (not time 
studies); 212 extra certificates for industrial designs, ete, (not time studies) ; 14 gold 
medals, 64 silver medals, and 106 bronze medals. 
Provincial art schools are established at Brockville, Hamilton, Kingston, London, 
Ottawa, St. Thomas, and Toronto. The annual grant voted by the legislature for 
these schools, including expenses for examination, etc., is $4,400. 
Art schools exhibition.—At the request of her excellency the Countess of Aberdeen 
and the representatives of the National Council of Women of Canada, who met in 
Ottawa in the month of May, 1898, I gave directions that the Annual Provincial 
Industrial Art Exhibition should be held in Ottawa during the time of the women’s 
convention, and appointed Dr. S. P. May, superintendent of art schools, to superin-

tend the exhibition, which consisted of the ordinary sessional work sent to the 
department for examination, viz, paintings in oil and water colors; drawings from 
life; outline and shading from the antique; original industrial designs; architectural 
designs and building construction; machine drawing; wood carving; modeling in 
clay; sculpture in marble; lithography; pen and ink sketches and photogravures; 
china painting, ete. 
Two large lecture rooms in the Ottawa Normal School were temporarily converted 
into art galleries, the light being properly adjusted in the daytime and the rooms 
lit up by electric lamps in the evenings. The walls and blackboards were covered. 
with the proper color groundwork for the display of the paintings, drawings, etc., 
and the rooms were appropriately decorated. 
The exhibition was formally opened by his excellency the Governor-General on 
the 18th of May, 1898. 
The exhibition was a great success and a pleasant surprise to the representatives 
from the United States and this Dominion who attended the convention, as well as 
the people of Ottawa, including students and pupils from different educational insti- 
tutions, who all expressed themselves as having no idea of the variety and excel- 
lence of art-school work done in our province. 
The Countess of Aberdeen was so much impressed with the importance of the 
exhibit from an industrial standpoint in the employment of women that she decided. 
to give a gold medal, which was subsequently awarded to Loretto Abbey, Toronto, 
for its magnificent display of painting on china. 
In connection with the exhibition, Dr. May gave an address on the history of art 
education in this province. 
8. Ontario Society of Artists. —This society receives an annual grant of $500 from 
the legislature on condition that it holds an annual exhibition of the work of its 
members, and from pictures exhibited shall select two pictures to the value of $200 
for permanent exhibition in the museum of the education department. 
The society has also to send me an annual report on the progress and advancement 
of art education in this province. 
During the past year the society held its annual exhibition, superintended the art 
department of the Toronto Industrial Exhibition, and was represented at the Loan 
Exhibition, Winnipeg, the Y. M. C. A. Loan, and Women’s Art Club, Toronto, and 
the Art Association of Montreal. In addition, several of its members sent pictures 
to the Royal Academy, London; the Paris Salon, and the National Academy of 
Design, New York. 
4. Provincial art gallery.—In order to encourage native art I entered into an agree- 
ment with the Ontario Society of Artists to provide an annual collection of pictures 
in one of the galleries in the educational museum, from which collection paintings 
to the amount of $800 (in addition to $200, for two pictures to be selected by the 
Ontario Society of Artists from their annual exhibits) are to be purchased every 
year. The artists in their annual report say: ‘There can be no doubt that the influ- 
ence of this patronage by the Ontario government is already being felt, and will 
stimulate our work very beneficially.” 
5. Literary and scientific institutions.—The following institutions receive financial 
aid from the Ontario government, viz: 
Hamilton Literary and Scientific Association; Kingston School of Mining and 
Agriculture; Ontario Historical Society; Ottawa Literary and Historical Society; 
Ottawa l'Institut Canadien; Ottawa Field Naturalist Club; Ottawa St. Patrick’s 
Literary and Scientific Association; Toronto Canadian Institute; Toronto Astro- 
nomical Society. 
Lectures are given by these societies on various subjects, including agriculture, 
architecture, astronomy, botany, biology, chemistry, electricity, natural history,   
 
-P-A-G-E-118
  1358 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
physics, etc.; also in general and Canadian history and literature. Museums are 
established in some of them; in others, free evening classes on science, ete., are 
given. 
The grants, $3,350, from the legislature to these institutions are well expended, as 
they teach branches of knowledge which assist in developing the natural talent of 
our people, and enable them more successfully to compete against the skilled arti- 
sans of other countries. 
The total number of institutions aided by grants from the legislature in this branch 
of the education department is as follows: 
Public and free libraries... 
  In addition, about fifty ladies’ colleges, etc., are affiliated with the department for 
examination in the fine arts. 
5. Educational museum.—This museum, established by the late Rey. Dr. Ryerson, 
chief superintendent of education, was opened to the public in 1856. At that time only 
one room on the first floor wasset apart for museum purposes. Gradually the whole 
of the rooms on this floor were filled, and the walls of the corridors, etc., had to be 
used for exhibiting busts, etc. For the past few years increased accommodation was 
required, and it is gratifying to state that, after frequent applications by this depart- 
ment to the legislature, in 1896 a special grant was voted for the erection of a new 
story on the top of the old education department buildings. This has been com- 
pleted, and we now have five extra rooms; also two properly lighted picture galleries. 
The increased space has enabled me to add four extra departments to the museum. 
(1) Archxology.—As the museum already contained an excellent collection of 
sculptured slabs, monuments, etc., illustrative of prehistoric and classical archeology, 
it was considered that a collection representing more particularly the primitive 
archeology of North America would be of great interest to the general public, and 
valuable to students in assisting them to trace the progressive stages of man from his 
savage state to that of civilization. Reports of this branch of the museum have been 
printed as appendixes to my annual report on education. 
(2) Zoology.—As natural history museums are regarded as important agents in 
national education, it was considered advisable that our museum should commence 
collecting specimens of natural history, and, as it was impossible for us to provide 
for a full representation of the fauna of North America, we have been content with 
collecting specimens of Canadian mammals and birds, and in the near future we 
hope to have our fresh-water fishes and reptiles well represented. 
(3) Botany.—As botany is now one of the studies in our schools, and is not alto- 
gether a “‘book study,’’ but a subject which can not be thoroughly taught without 
astudy of plants, it was decided to establish an herbarium of Canadian plants to 
assist pupils in different parts of the Province in ascertaining the proper methods of 
mounting specimens, classifications, etc. 
(4) Provincial art gallery.—In order to encourage native art talent, an agreement 
was entered into some two years ago between the education department and the 
Ontario Society of Artists, by which one of the large art galleries in the museum shall 
be annually filled with the most recent pictures of the members of the society. The 
scheme has been successful, and the artists acknowledge that it has assisted in devel- 
oping more interest in their work and an increased sale for their pictures. 
As sculpture is a kindred subject to painting, and has been considered in all ages 
as one of the most important branches of art for perpetuating the memories of great 
and good men, I have encouraged this branch of art by employing Canadian sculp- 
tors to model busts of distinguished Canadians, and although the annual amount at 
 
-P-A-G-E-119
EDUCATION IN CANADA. 1359 
my disposal for this purpose is very small, I have succeeded in making a fair repre- 
sentative collection of prominent Canadians. (See contents of museum, Department 
4, Modern Sculpture. ) 
AGRICULTURE, 
The department has made several attempts to promote the study of agriculture in 
the public schools of the Province. Under the regulations in force for the last ten 
years instruction has been given in agriculture in all the model schools in the country 
as well as in the normal schools, and every teacher authorized to teach a public school 
during this period has had some training in the best methods of teaching the subject. 
In 1891 public-school trustees were, by regulation, authorized to introduce the sub- 
ject of agriculture into the fourth and fifth forms of the school, and where such reg- 
ulation was adopted the inspector was required to report annually to the trustees as 
to the course taken by the pupils and their knowledge of the subject. Although this 
regulation has been in force for seven years, so far as I know no board of school 
trustees has passed the necessary resolution, and, as a consequence, the subject 
receives very scant attention. 
One reason alleged for the neglect of the study of agriculture was that the text- 
book authorized by the department was too technical, and was uninteresting to the 
pupils. In order to overcome this difficulty, arrangements were made by the depart- 
ment with C. C. James, B. A., deputy minister of agriculture and formerly a member 
of the staff of the agricultural college, to prepare a text-book, so simple in its lan- 
guage and so elementary in its treatment of the subject as to be within the range of 
pupils from 12 to 15 years of age. arly in the year Mr. James gubmitted the man- 
uscript of such a text-book, and after fully considering its merits, it was duly author- 
ized by the department. 
COMMERCIAL EDUCATION. 
The business activity of the age is calling for improved courses of commercial edu- 
cation in most countries, and the demands for what is termed a practical education 
are repeated from time to time. It is universally admitted that practical skill in 
every department of life requires intelligence and general mental activity. Educa- 
tionists now fully recognize that intellectual skill and power are promoted by train- 
ing in habits of observation and reflection. No better means of promoting this 
training can be secured than by providing the best instruction in reading, writing, 
arithmetic, literature, and the other ordinary subjects of an elementary school course. 
Indeed, it should not be forgotten that failures in life are due more largely to defects 
in character than to want of knowledge. Apart from this principle, it must be 
admitted that the subjects taught in our public schools are of the most practical char- 
acter possible, and that no farmer, artisan, or merchant could possibly dispense with 
a knowledge of the subjects of the prescribed course. If industrial training is to be 
promoted, it can only be made successful by giving suitable instruction in the ordi- 
nary subjects of the school programme. Accordingly, the fifth form of the public 
school provides a course in bookkeeping which will enable students to gain a knowl- 
edge of single and double entry; commercial forms, such as drafts, notes, and checks; 
general business transactions. This course is specially suitable for farmers and arti- 
sans, or for retail merchants and general traders. This course provides amply for a 
pupil of 14 or 15 years of age all the bookkeeping that he is capable of compre- 
hending at that age. 
Under amendments made in 1891 to the high-schools act, regulations were pre- 
scribed for commercial specialists, thus giving in our high schools and collegiate 
institutes a further impetus to the acquisition of a business education. The course 
of study prescribed for commercial specialists is a very extensive one, and it may be 
doubted if in any part of the world the school law calls for teachers of such high 
attainments in commercial subjects.  
-P-A-G-E-120

The course for commercial diploma consists of bookkeeping, business forms and 
usages, and stenography. 
[Citation from report on technical education by Mr. John Millar, B. A,, deputy minister of cduca- 
tion, Ontario.] 
SUGGESTIONS AS TO HIGH SCHOOLS. 
Should technical education be carried on in our high schools and 
collegiate institutes, or should separate institutions be established for 
the purpose? My impressions have been favorable to the former. I 
know no reason why there should be any duplication of classes. So 
far as I have conversed with Ontario high-school masters, they are 
decidedly in sympathy with technical education, and much may be 
accomplished if they are relieved in the way I have indicated from the 
pressure of university matriculation examinations.’ I must acknowl- 
edge, however, that the experience of the United States, and the opin- 
ions of those on the other side best informed, to whom I have spoken 
on the matter, are against my view. I was told repeatedly that where 
technical education is simply attached to the existing course of study 
there is a danger that it will be slighted and made a mere makeshift 
to satisfy popular demands. The best manual-training high schools 
or technical schools are undoubtedly distinct institutions, though 
under the same school board. The principal in each case is a good 
administrator, a university scholar, and teacher of years of experience. 
Those in charge of the technical departments are fully trained for their 
work, but they are experienced teachers as well. Judging by what I 
observed in the technical schools on the other side, the employment 
of persons acquainted with mechanical operations, but not teachers, 
would make a weak staff. 
Under the circumstances, if the municipalities are ready to incur 
the cost, I think in a large city like Toronto, and perhaps in cities like 
Kingston, Hamilton, London, and Ottawa, a separate building would 
be preferable, with equipments resembling those of the institutions 
mentioned in Boston, Cambridge, or Brooklyn, N. Y. It is not neces- 
sary to refer to the Drexel Institute, Philadelphia, or Pratt Institute, 
Brooklyn, as they are privately endowed institutions, and their pur- 
poses are of a different character. Unless much money can be counted 
upon, it would be folly to attempt anything so pretentious as either of 
these institutions would suggest. If a technical school is established 
in one of our cities, all pupils should be required to pass the high- 
school entrance examination before admission. No fees should be 
charged resident pupils, and if the Province is to give assistance, it 
should be with the understanding that high fees should not shut out 
nonresident pupils. 
In other places a separate institution for techni 
  1 education could

pupils on the certificates of high-school principals in lieu of examination.

scarcely be maintained. Indeed, a good technical school should give 
students ready access to the industries of a large manufacturing city. 
A room in each of our large high schools and collegiate institutes 
might, however, be provided for manual training in woodwork, but I 
am not sanguine of immediate results. I see no reason why one of the 
regular teachers, who has a good knowledge of drawing and who is 
not averse to using the tools of a mechanic, could not, in a few weeks, 
acquaint himself with all that is necessary to begin work of this kind. 
A large amount of machinery is of course necessary for a technical 
high school, but for manual training in mere woodwork the cost for 
appliances would be very trifling.

FOUNDATION AND ORIGINAL PROVISIONS OF THE ONTARIO SYSTEM OF 
EDUCATION. 
The following statement is taken from the prefatory remarks to the 
sixth volume of the Documentary History of Education in Upper 
Canada, by Dr. J. George Hodgins, M. A., LL.D., barrister at law, 
librarian and historiographer to the education department of Ontario. 
Dr. Hodgins has brought to this work the double qualification of administrator 
and author. His official connection with the educational system of Ontario dates 
from its inception. The intimate friend and colaborer of Dr. Ryerson, he became 
his chief of staff in 1844 and for thirty-three years labored with him to develop the 
system for which Ontario is justly distinguished. 
Dr. Hodgins’s executive ability was fully appreciated by Dr. Ryerson, who said of 
him: “He is the ablest and most thorough administrator of a public department of 
any man whom I haye met.” 
In 1846 Dr. Hodgins was made secretary of the board of education for Upper 
Canada, which body was afterwards designated the council of public instruction, and 
in 1855 was appointed deputy minister of education. He has written extensively on 
educational topics, is the author of several valuable text-books and now crowns his 
labors with a history of the system with which he has so long been identified. The 
Documentary History has involved immense research and discriminating judgment. 
Six volumes are already published, and the whole when finished will form, with 
the volume on history and legislation of separate schools in Upper Canada, a work 
of great value to all interested in the social and political development of Canada and 
to all students of educational history. 
CITATIONS FROM THE PREFATORY REMARKS. 
This sixth yolume of the Documentary History of Education in Upper Canada is 
largely devoted to a record of proceedings, which detail what steps were taken in 
1846 in laying ‘‘educational foundations.” 
As this volume deals chiefly with the subject of ‘‘first things,’ in connection with 
our system of public education, and of “‘laying foundations,” as connected with that 
system and university education, I think it desirable to specify, in a somewhat gen- 
eral form, what is implied by these expressions in this connection. 
The ‘‘first things’? which this volume records as having been accomplished in 
1846 are: 
1. The publication of an extended report on a projected system of popular educa- 
tion for Upper Canada. 
ED 99—vo1 11——86 
   
-P-A-G-E-122
1362 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99, 
2. The preparation and passing of a common-school bill, founded upon that report, 
and the first school bill prepared under the auspices of Dr. Ryerson. 
3. The appointment of a board of education for Upper Canada. 
4. The selection of a series of school text-books, which remained in use in the 
common sehools for twenty-two years, and until 1868. 
5. The organization of the education department under the school act of 1846. 
6. The establishment of a provincial normal school (formally opened in 1847). 
7. The substitution of district school superintendents for local township superin- 
tendents. 
8. General forms and regulations for the government of common schools, includ- 
ing provision for giving religious instruction in these schools, under the school act 
of 1846. 
The only real and effective efforts put forth in 1846 were those of the newly 
appointed chief superintendent of education, in regard to the common schools of the 
Province. The strenuous efforts made during that year to settle the university 
question were practically abortive. They proved, nevertheless, in the end, to be 
highly useful in clearing the way to a final settlement, at least for the time, a few 
years later, of that vexed question; but just then they were only tentative in their 
effects. 
On his return from an examination, during 1844-45, of the systems of education 
and various kinds of schools in Europe and in the Eastern part of the United States, 
Dr. Ryerson prepared an elaborate ‘‘ Report on a system of public elementary in- 
struction for Upper Canada,” in 1846. This report was based upon his own personal 
observations and the experience of others, who preceded him in making similar 
investigations and whom he quotes as authorities in his report. 
In the preparation of that report Dr. Ryerson had the great advantage—of which 
he availed himself freely—of consulting the report of a prolonged inquiry (like the 
one which he had just made) into the state of popular education in Europe, and the 
modes of teaching adopted in European schools, by that noted American education- 
ist, the Hon. Horace Mann. Mr. Mann, at the time of his visit to Europe, in 1843, 
was secretary to the State board of education of Massachusetts. His reasons for 
making that tour of observation were in effect those which had influenced Dr. 
Ryerson to visit Europe, with a similar object in view. They were also of a thor- 
oughly practical kind, and they are stated very graphically by Mr. Mann, in the 
preliminary part of his report, as follows: 
“T have attended a great number of educatienal meetings, and, as far as possible, 
have read whatever has been written, whether at home or abroad, by persons qual- 
ified to instruct mankind on this momentous subject; still, I have been oppressed 
with a painful consciousness of my inability to expound the merits of this great 
heme in all their magnitude and variety, and have turned my eyes, again and again, 
to some new quarter of the horizon, in the hope that they would be greeted by a 
brighter beam of light. 
“Under these circumstances it was natural that the celebrity of institutions in 
foreign countries should attract my attention, and that I should feel an intense 
desire of knowing whether, in any respect, those institutions were superior to our 
own, and, if anything were found in them worthy of adoption, of transferring it for 
our improvement. Accordingly, * * * having obtained permission from the 
State board of education, * * * I embarked for Europe on the Ist of May” 
(1843). * * * 
“Among the nations of Europe Prussia has long enjoyed the most distinguished 
reputation for the excellence of itsschools. In reviews, in speeches, in tracts, and 
even in graver works devoted to the cause of education, its schools have been 
exhibited as models for the imitation of the rest of Christendom. * * * 
“T have seen countries in whose schools all forms of corporal punishment were

| EDUCATION IN CANADA. 13638 
used without stint or measure; and I have visited one nation [Holland] in whore 
excellent and well-ordered schools scarcely a blow has been struck for more than a 
quarter ofa century. * * * 
“On reflection it seems to me that it would be most strange if from all this vari- 
ety of system and of no system—of sound instruction, and of babbling, of the dis- 
cipline of violence and of moral means—many beneficial hints for our warning or 
our imitation could not be derived; and as the subject comes clearly within the 
purview of my duty, ‘to collect and diffuse information respecting schools,’ I yen- 
ture to submit to the Massachusetts board the results of my observations.”’ 
In the light of to-day, and noting the great advance which has been made—espe- 
cially in England—in the matter of public education during more than fifty years, 
this graphic bird’s-eye picture of the state and character of popular education and 
of schools in Europe is deeply interesting. It is the more so, and also the more 
valuable, from the fact that the picture is drawn by a master hand—one whose 
name is still a household word in educational circles in the United States, and 
especially in New England. 
The late distinguished Dr. Fraser, Lord Bishop of Manchester, in his official report 
of 1865, when as commissioner from England he made inquiry into the state of edu- 
cation in the United States and Canada, speaking both of Horace Mann and of 
Egerton Ryerson, said: 
“What national education in Great Britain owes to Sir James Kay Shuttleworth, 
what education in New England owes to Horace Mann, that debt Canada owes to 
Egerton Ryerson.”’ 
It was but natural that with so able and experienced an educationist, who bad 
but lately—just the year before—gone over the same field, Dr. Ryerson should 
“compare notes with Mr. Mann” and fortify his opinions and conclusions by quot- 
ing, as he has largely done in his report, those of Mr. Mann on the schools of Eng- 
land and of the continent of Europe. Mr. Mann’s report, it should be remarked, 
was reprinted in England at the time and deservedly attained the —— of an educa- 
tional authority. 
This report of Dr. Ryerson was published as a parliamentary paper in 1846, and, 
in 1847, 3,000 additional copies of it were printed in pamphlet form, and for some 
years largely formed the basis of subsequent school legislation in Upper Canada. 
Soon after the publication of his report Dr. Ryerson drafted his first common- 
school bill, which during the parliamentary session of 1846 became the common- 
school act of 1846, known as the Ninth Victoria, Chapter XX. 
As this comprehensive report on a projected system of public elementary educa- 
tion for Upper Canada is somewhat elaborate, I shall here merely refer to some of 
the main features of it. In preparing the report Dr. Ryerson wisely laid down cer- 
tain fundamental principles which he believed to be essential to the success and 
stability of that system. These general principles may be thus summarized: 
1. That the machinery of education should be in the hands of the people them- 
selves, and should be managed through their own agency; they should therefore, 
he held, be consulted, by means of public meetings and conferences, in regard to all 
school legislation. This he himself did every few years. 
2. That the aid of the government should only be given where it could be used 
most effectually to stimulate and assist local effort in this great work. 
3. That the property of the cons is responsible for and should contribute 
1Speaking of his three wi eke? = in ena Poe inquiries into our system of education in 
Upper Canada, Dr. Fraser, in another part of his report of 1865, said: * * * ‘My best thanks are 
due to Dr. Ryerson, the chief superintendent, and to Mr. Hodgins, the deputy superintendent, for 
the abundant facilities they afforded me for making myself acquainted with the system of which 
they are the efficient administrators.” Report, page 205. The other remarks, quoted above, will be 
found on page 279 of the same report. 
 
-P-A-G-E-124
  1864 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
toward the education of the entire youth of the country; and that as a complement 
to this ‘‘compulsory education”’ should necessarily be enforced. 
4, That a thorough and systematic inspection of the schools by competent per- 
sons is essential to their vitality and efficiency. 
It was not to be expected that so comprehensive a scheme of education as that 
proposed by Dr. Ryerson in 1846 would at once meet with general acceptance. Its 
outlines were considered to be too broad for a young country like Canada, and there- 
fore objections were urged against it as impracticable. Even his reference to the 
compact and systematized plan adopted in Prussia was held to be an indication of 
his intention to introduce the “‘ oppressive’’ system of so-called ‘‘ Prussian despotism.’? 
This subject at the time was keenly discussed, but I have only devoted a short space 
on pages 214 and 215, in referring to the discussion itself, as an incident or episode 
connected with the introduction of a new school system into Upper Canada. 
The school law of 1846, founded upon this report, provided, among other things, 
for— 
1. A general board of education for the province to take charge of a normal school 
and to aid the chief superintendent in certain matters. 
. A normal school, with practice or model schools attached. 
. The regulations for common-school libraries. 
. Plans of school-houses, rural and urban. 
. Appointment of district instead of township school superintendents. 
3. Apportionment of school moneys to each municipality according to the ratio 
of population, and to each school district according to the ratio of children in such 
school district, as compared with those in the whole township, (and not, as after- 
wards by the act of 1850, according to the average attendance of children at each 
school. ) 
7. Levy of a school rate by each district municipal council of a sum at least equal 
to the legislative grant to each such district. 
8. The collection, by the local school trustees, of the balance required to defray 
the expenses of their school, by rate bill upon parents and guardians. (It was only 
under the school act of 1850 that trustees could raise this money in the way which 
the school ratepayers at the annual school meeting might determine. ) 
9. The recommendation of a uniform series of text-books, with a proviso that no 
aid would be given to any school in which books disapproved of by the provincial 
board of education might be used. 
10. The establishment of district model schools, aided by parliamentary grants 
(reenacted from the school law of 1843). 
11. Examination and licensing of common-school teachers by the district and not 
by the township school superintendent, as heretofore. 
12. Visitation of schools by clergymen, magistrates, municipal councilors, etc., as 
“school visitors.’’ 
13. Protection of children (reenacted from the school law of 1843) from being 
“required to read or study in or from any religious book, or join in any religious 
exercise or devotion, objected to by parents.’’ 
14. Establishment (reenacted from the school laws of 1841 and 1843) of Roman 
Catholic separate schools where the teacher of the locality was a Protestant, and 
vice versa. (These schools only received grants in accordance with their average 
attendance of pupils. In 1850 this restriction applied to common and separate 
schools alike. ) 
15. Levy of rates by district municipal councils, at their discretion, and by them 
alone, for the erection of schoolhouses and teachers’ residences. 
Such were the principal provisions of the first school act, proposed and adapted 
chiefly from other school laws by Dr. Ryerson in 1846, so far as rural schools were Om oo bo a

concerned. In the following year he prepared a comprehensive measure in regard 
to schools in cities, towns, and incorporated villages. 
The establishment of the first provincial normal school of Upper Canada, with its 
model schools or schools of practice, was a notable event, as recorded in this volume. 
So essential has this class of schools become that there are now three of them, besides 
anormal college, in this province. 
The county model schools, authorized by the act of 1843, and specially aided by 
the government, were continued under the act of 1846, While they have been very 
greatly improved of late years, yet in these early years they did good service in 
giving candidates for school-teaching the first general idea of what was necessary to 
know and to practice in order to become successful teachers in the schools. : 
The selection of an excellent and well-prepared series of school text-books—the 
Irish National—was probably the most important practical event of the school year, 
as these schoolbooks continued to be uninterruptedly in use in the common schools 
of Upper Canada for twenty-one years, and were only superseded by a new and 
revised Canadian edition of them in 1868. 
The task of introducing these text-books into the common schools in 1846 was 
indeed a difficult and delicate one. It was done without exciting the latent strong 
opposition which was known to exist in many places on the part of those who 
regarded Morse’s Geography, Kirkham’s Grammar, Daboll’s Arithmetic, Cobb’s 
Spelling Book, and a great variety of other such schoolbooks, then in use, as unex- 
ceptionally good. The chapter on the ‘“‘Text-book question in 1846,” page 273 of 
this volume, deals fully with the difficulties then encountered on this subject. Some 
of these difficulties arose from the efforts made by the local writers of special and 
single schoolbooks, forming no part of a connected series, to retain their publications 
in continued use in the schools. i 
No compulsion was employed to unduly expedite a ehaaeed in text-books; nor was 
any Canadian schoolbook forbidden to be used in the schools. In the case of 
United States schoolbooks, a reasonable time was allowed before they were disap- 
proved of by the provincial board of education. As a matter of fact, the Irish 
National schoolbooks, by their intrinsic excellence, gradually superseded all other 
text-books in the schools. 
Among the means employed to give effect to the new common-school act for 1846 
was the sending of a circular, in regard to the schools, to the district municipal 
councils, embodying in it a strong appeal for cooperation and for active and practical 
support. Another circular, largely explanatory and suggestive, was sent to the 
newly appointed district superintendents of schools, giving them all necessary infor- 
mation in regard to their duties, and directions as to the efficient inspection of 
schools, and also as to how to deal with teachers who apply for certificates of qualifi- 
cation, and on other matters.

CHAPTER XXX. 
WILLIAM PRESTON JOHNSTON’S WORK FOR A NEW 
SOUTH.* 
By Rey. A. D. Mayo, A. M., LL. D. 
No school year begins as the year before it evolved to its triumphant ending. One 
change in the superintendency of the public-school system of an American city may 
become the most potent factor in the educational development of that community 
for a generation to come. The death of President William Preston Johnston, of 
Tulane University, New Orleans, La., at the home of his daughter in Lexington, 
Ky., on July 17, was an event of so much public importance, apart from a wide per- 
sonal acquaintance, that for the coming few months the attention of the better- 
informed educational public of the whole country will be directed to-that city. It 
_is not too much to say that any arrest of the educational policy represented by Presi- 
‘dent Johnston would just now be a greater calamity to that city and State, and, 
indirectly but surely, to the whole Southwest, than any political action of the entire 
group of States included in this section. 
} William Preston Johnston was born in Kentucky, the son of Gen. Albert Sidney 
Johnston, in 1831. After a miscellaneous preparatory schooling at home, he gradu- 
ated at Yale, studied law at Louisville, and, in 1862, at the age of 31, became aid- 
de-camp of President Davis till the close of the civil war. After several months of 
confinement as a political prisoner, he was called, in 1867, by General, then Presi- 
dent, R. E. Lee, to the chair of English literature in Washington and Lee University 
in Virginia. During this period he wrote the life of his father. In 1880 he was 
called to the presidency of the Louisiana State University at Baton Rouge, where he 
remained until his final position was found as president of Tulane University in 
New Orleans in 1884. 3 
Here, first, during the memorable fifteen years of the development of this remark- 
able seat of learning, the young colonel, professor, and temporary president of a 
demoralized State university attained a national reputation, beyond question, with 
the exception of his friend, Dr. J. L. M. Curry, the most notable of the new educa- 
tional leaders of the South. What men like the late Bishop Haygood and Dr. 
Curry have done as missionaries at large in the great development of the American 
system of universal education during the past thirty years, President Johnston, in 
a work almost exclusively local, but of enduring value and increasing reputation, has 
achieved by the planting and nurture, in the very heart of the old South, under the 
most embarrassing circumstances, of the group of schools now included under the 
general title, Tulane University. With no disposition to depreciate the excellent 
work now being done in several of the more progressive colleges and universities in 
these sixteen States, we have no hesitation in declaring that in what it now is, what 
it represents, and what it can be made in the near future, this institution stands for 
an educational poliey that signifies more to the future of those States than every- 
thing that has been written and said concerning Southern affairs since its establish- 
ment in 1884.

  1368 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
The two men who seem to have been born and educated as the permanent repre- 
sentatives of the new education of the Southern people, including both races and all 
classes, were S. C. Armstrong and William Preston Johnston. Both were of New 
England descent and graduates of New England colleges. Both were specially trained. 
in their youth, in the most characteristic circles, for the great work of their future. 
Both were engaged in the civil war, in positions especially valuable for wide obser- 
vation and in intimate relations with the group of remarkable men that surrounded 
Lincoln and Davis. Neither of them would probably be regarded by the experts a 
great schoolmaster; yet both were, in the best sense of the word, educational states- 
men, fit associates of Mann, Barnard, Winthrop, Haygood, Curry, and the only man 
yet developed from the colored race worthy of such designation, Mr. Booker Wash- 
ington. They both were given time to plant the new departure so firmly in South- 
ern soil that Johnston could say on his deathbed, like Armstrong, that he was no 
longer a necessity in the institution which owed its existence and character essen- 
tially to his great personality. 
Armstrong, at Hampton, Va., solved the question of the true education of the 
negro—the question on which the whole future of the South depends—so completely 
that the Southern educational public and every Southern State have organized the 
elementary, secondary, industrial, and higher education for their 8,000,000 colored 
people on the Hampton plan; and, within the coming twenty years, if not earlier, 
the entire missionary and educational work in our new colonial possessions will be 
pitched on the Hampton keynote. 
In a way less exposed to national obseryation—indeed, perhaps even now not appre- 
ciated in many of the “educational centers’ of the North—President Johnston, in 
the very heart of the most intensely southern portion of the South, like Dr. Curry 
personally and by training a Southerner of the Southerners, in fifteen years has built 
up an institution that in the honesty and thorough excellence of all its instruction 
is not the inferior of any school of the higher education in the country. And, 
beyond this, in its ideal of organization, methods of college discipline, adaptation 
to the most embarrassing variety of population in a city and State whose previous 
experiments in education had been little more than a series of brilliant failures, 
Tulane University to-day represents more completely the imperative Southern neces- 
sity of the broadest education and the most comprehensive method of dealing with 
this necessity of any school south of Mason and Dixon’s linv. Indeed, to find its 
companion work in the North would be difficult. Perhaps the new University of 
Chicago is the only eminent representative of the same policy of adaptation in the 
Northern States. 
When President Johnston came to Louisiana, in 1880, as president of the State 
University, he found the educational system in the midst of what might be called a 
struggle for existence. The university at Baton Rouge was without funds, in a hired 
house, with 39 students. The fifteen years of fearful political agitation since the 
days of ’65 had made the proper development of the new public-school system almost 
an impossibility. In New Orleans the common school was practically in a state of 
siege, with the teachers unpaid and the educational public greatly discouraged. 
The one thoroughly live spot in city and State seemed to be the University of Loui- 
siana, an excellent collegiate school in New Orleans, doing more work on its moder- 
ate income of $10,000 a year than any similar institution in the State. The gift of 
Paul Tulane of agreat block of real estate for the founding of a college for white youth 
could easily have been disposed of after the method by which every previous dona- 
tion in Louisiana had been robbed of its vitality, or the college established by it 
could have easily added another to the long roll of institutions for all races and both 
sexes which during the past century have played fast and loose with the highest 
educational titles, with varied results. 
"The coming of President Johnston at the age of 53, in the full development of his 
     
-P-A-G-E-129
WILLIAM PRESTON JOHNSTON. 1369 
magnetic and conservative manhood, with his training for the past twenty-five years, 
was the most pronounced new departure in the higher education in the Southwest, 
Inder the leadership of Dr. Sears and the Peabody education board of trustees, 
backed by the progressive section of the Southern educational public, the common- 
school system for the whole people had been inaugurated in every State and was 
literally waiting, with great expectation, for the action of Congress on the Blair bill 
for national aid to education. But it can truly be said that in 1880 the American 
system at best had only effected a lodgment in the Southwest. In this entire group of 
five States there were not a dozen good free high schools for white pupils, probably 
not twenty graded school systems; and the State universities, either ruined by the 
war or not yet established, had before them a battle for life with the old established 
system of ecclesiastical denominational education, still in possession of the ground. 
In Louisiana the problem was complicated by the obstinate social and religious dis- 
tinctions which, from the beginning had successively met and almost overthrownevery 
attempt to plant the American system even for the white race. Wappily for the 
new experiment, the new-come president found himself supported by the most intel- 
ligent, resolute, and tactful board of trustees in the South, with Hon. Randall Gib- 
son as its chairman, all personal friends, and with such wise confidence in their 
leader that he was virtually given a free hand. 
The record of the great work of President Johnston and his excellent faculties of 
Tulane, in both its departments for men and women, requires more than the allotted 
columns of a metropolitan daily. But in brief, the different steps may be noted— 
1. The new president faced the situation with a courage that in a weaker man 
would have been professional destruction. He simply told the people that a State, 
full of so-called ‘‘colleges,’’ had not in it the material for a proper university, and 
that the only hope of one was the vital connection of Tulane with every live element 
of popular education in the Commonwealth. In the face of the most relentless 
ecclesiasticism he planted Tulane on the broad American platform of the State 
university in its character-training of youth of all sorts and conditions of theological 
beliefs. In a State which had just emancipated a majority of its people from chattel 
slavery, he announced that every boy entering Tulane must take off his coat and 
fight it out on the manual-training line of mechanics, and sent to Boston for a group 
of experts in this direction. By a wise stroke he utilized the admirable school 
known as the University of Louisiana, with its corps of accomplished teachers, ag 
the preparatory training school for his collegiate and university departments. 
2. It was soon found that Tulane was to be no hospital for educational invalids, 
worn-out veterans, and impecunious social celebrities. The new president had 
already, in the academical, medical, and legal schools, probably the ablest corps of 
instructors gathered around any Southern institution of learning; the majority young 
men of promise, one of whom has already graduated to the presidency of a great 
State university, representing every section of the country with up-to-date educa- 
tional ideals. A most important department, really the outcome of the industrial 
training, was the organization within and without the university of a proper school 
of ornamental design; on the one hand attracting the most accomplished women, 
and on the other extending a friendly right hand to the mechanical and operative 
class of the city, recognizing the fact that the final office of New Orleans is to become 
a great center of ornamental manufacturing industry for the Southwest. In every 
position in this extended scheme was found an expert, insisting on a thorough 
dealing with the work in hand. 
3. The president displayed the qualities of the true educational statesman in 
avoiding all controversy and provoking no unfriendly criticism from the regulation 
college or university enywhere. In the line of the famous maxim of Napoleon, ‘‘In 
any new departure, let the leaders alone and go direct to the people,”’ for the first 
time in Southern educational history a university president faced right about and,
-P-A-G-E-130
1370 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
with neither apology nor explanation, harnessed Tulane to every vital agency of 
universal education in Louisiana and the Southwest. He was the soul of the Louisiana 
Education Society, that, in the ten years of its activity, gathered the friends of the 
common school in the city of New Orleans into a powerful organization, which, in 
the ten years of its activity, repulsed the assault of its enemies, woke up its friends 
in city and State, and laid the broad foundation of what is now one of the most 
hopeful of the public-school organizations of the Southwest. Along with this he 
placed the entire university at the disposal of the common-school teachers and edu- 
cational public, through a system of free public lectures by his faculty and eminent 
gentlemen from the whole country, during one whole season supporting a campaign 
of education that reached almost every considerable village in the State. He was 
always ready to answer the call to speak anywhere, through several months in com- 
pany with the author of this paper, meeting the workingmen of both races in their 
labor unions in New Orleans. Indeed, in this way the city teachers of New Orleans 
for several years received from Tulane University a course of instruction equivalent to 
anormal school of the broadest and highest grade. He began at once the development 
of the free public library which has grown into the present free library of the city. By 
a system of free scholarships from all the parishes or counties of the State, and others 
offered for competition in the leading schools, he built up a constituency which can 
not be diverted while Tulane retains its present ascendence. By a fortunate early 
investment in school buildings in the city, with an addition to the original endow- 
ment, the university has now been enabled to house itself in an admirable situation 
adjoining Audubon Park, while the medical department has been favored in a sim- 
ilar way in town. The time will come, with the inevitable coming prosperity of the 
city, when additional endowments will furnish the necessary funds for the complete 
development that always haunted the mind and burdened the heart of its great 
president. 
4, But perhaps the most characteristic feature in this almost romantic story of 
Tulane is its remarkable success in handling the delicate subject of the higher edu- 
cation of woman. Although no part of the country can show a more enthusiastic 
group of young women, often longing in vain for the means of obtaining but no 
less praying for the best in the higher education, up to ten years ago the South had 
been slow to answer the call. There has, indeed, been a gratifying advancement in 
the character of the so-called female colleges of the section, many of which are 
becoming valuable secondary schools for women with an upper grade college attach- 
ment. A few of the State universities have opened their doors to girls; and six of 
these States have established the free normal and industrial college for white girls, 
while every Southern State has now a State normal school. But the most complete 
institution of the higher education for women is doubtless the Sophia Newconib 
College—the proper woman’s department of Tulane University. Under the masterly 
administration of President B. V.B.Dixon....... the Sophia Newcomb College 
has grown in ten short years into a genuine companionship with Tulane. By its 
conditions of admission it has sensibly lifted up the entire system of female seminaries 
in the city and State. Its new buildings, with their furnishings, are the most attractive 
spectacle in the new side of New Orleans. Aiming at thoroughness in all its work, 
it has in its president one of the most competent representatives of the higher educa- 
tional philosophy; and it already has become a power in the cultivation of the literary 
and artistic life of New Orleans and the Southwest. Its graduates are admitted on 
equal terms to all the privileges of the university. 
This great work, which still remains far short of its own complete development at 
home, but in the future is to make a radical change in the entire organization of 
the secondary and higher education through the South, is a good illustration of the 
imperative need of first-class leadership. No State, perhaps, in this section had a 
larger number of broad-minded and well-disposed people for such work than Loui-
-P-A-G-E-131

siana fifteen years ago. Tulane University is the result of the best thought of this 
group of people, under the fit leadership of President Johnston. Indeed, in his 
state of failing health, which for ten years made him almost an invalid, it would 
have been impossible even for him to have done his work without the hearty coop- 
eration of trustees, faculty, and a resolute educational public. Randall Gibson used 
to say that he ‘‘never knew a man of finer fiber than President Johnston.”” It was 
only by the power of a maryelous personality, in which an indomitable will was 
harnessed to a childlike Christian faith, a rare social charm, and a magnetic quality 
of leadership, that this man could face the inevitable coming of the end; through 
years of suffering and weariness, denying himself the luxury of dying that he might 
leave his great task so far accomplished that it can hardly fail of becoming his 
noblest monument in the future.

CHAPTER XXXI. 
REPORT ON EDUCATION IN ALASKA. 
DePARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, 
Bureau or Epucation, ALASKA Drviston, 
Washington, D. C., June 30, 1899. 
Sir: I have the honor to submit my fourteenth annual report as United States 
general agent of education in Alaska for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1899. 
Twenty Government schools, with an enrollment of 1,369, were in operation dur- 
ing the year. The following reports give an idea of the character and scope of these 
schools: 
Sitka, No. 1.—Miss Cassia Patton, teacher; enrollment, 31; population, white, 
American and Russian. Miss Patton reports as follows: 
“My work during the past year has been very pleasant. The yard has been 
inclosed by a new picket fence which adds much to its appearance. We have one of 
the most desirable sites in town, facing a sandy beach with an unobstructed view of 
Sitka’s island-dotted bay. The schoolroom is well lighted, but owing to the cloudi- 
ness of the short days, I found it necessary to use lamp light more than usual. 
“T have added to my circulating library 100 of the 5-cent classics, and the chil- 
dren haye enjoyed them. I have found McMurry’s Methods in Reading a help in 
making the list of books which I hope to add during another year. A good library 
is one of the greatest needs of our village. In our ‘story period,’ fifteen minutes 
each afternoon, story reading has been the greatest -success. After hearing stories 
read to them several of the children would borrow the copy of the book and read. 
it again to themselves many times. 
“Believing that proper food would do much toward making many homes happier 
we have had a few cooking lessons. I placed on the blackboard carefully worded 
recipes which the girls copied in their notebooks and tried at home. They seemed 
very much interested, and [ hope this attempt may result in much good.” 
Sitka, No. 2.—Miss Anna Kelsey, teacher; enrollment, 175; population, Thlinget. 
The following is Miss Kelsey’s report: 
“The year now closed has been pleasant, but greatly broken in upon by the old 
customs of the natives and trouble between the different factions, which at one time 
threatened to be very serious. Finally they were induced to let the United States 
judge adjust their differences. He deferred his decision until the hard feeling had 
in a measure subsided. I find the native children bright, but restless. During the 
winter there were quite a number of visiting children belonging to the Taku and 
Killisnoo tribes, who were here for weeks feasting, dancing, potlaching, etc. Thou- 
sands of dollars were spent in this way by our natives. Many made themselves 
poor. Later in the season they were obliged to go out and hunt or work for 
themselves. 
“T used all sorts of devices to attract the children to school, with some success 
until their troubles broke out; then our numbers became small. Only one pupil 
attended throughout the year. I presented him with a suit of clothes at the end of 
the term. His mother is a widow with three small children, of whom he is the 
oldest. Both mother and boy were very happy indeed.’
-P-A-G-E-134
  1374 EDUCATION REPORT, 1808-99. 
Sitka Industrial School.—Room No. 1, Mrs. E. C. Heizer, teacher; enrollment, 91; 
population, Thlinget. Mrs. Heizer writes: 
“The interest throughout the year has been very good. Some of my pupils are as 
enthusiastic students as I ever had in any school. One young man has repeatedly 
expressed his regrets that he had not entered several years ago. His zeal is an 
inspiration, so eager is he to advance. 
“The examinations conducted by our superintendent on the completion of a study 
haye been an incentive to thoroughness. 
“They have given several very creditable entertainments during the year, in which 
the pupils showed their individuality. 
“Several of the girls want to be seamstresses. They have a knowledge of frac- 
tions which will aid them in cutting out work. A few of my pupils show by their 
interest and earnestness that in course of time they may become teachers themselves. 
One young woman has received special attention, and has been placed in training in 
the primary department in order to acquire experience in teaching. She spends 
two and a half days of each week in this way. 
“Our school compares favorably with the leading Indian schools of our country. 
The greatest hindrance is that the native parents are not willing to place their chil- 
dren in school fora sufficient length of time to acquire a thorough preparation. This 
hinders them from becoming first-class carpenters or independent workers in any of 
the industries. Until the native parents realize the great advantage of a thorough 
education, I suppose we can only do our best and not grow weary in well-doing.” 
Juneau, No. 1.—C. C. Solter, teacher; alpen 74; population, white. The 
following is Mr. Solter’s report: 
‘As in every new country, many of the nodes are not permanent settlers. As 
soon as business grows dull in one place they leave for a more promising field or 
return to the States, taking their children with them. This is a serious cause of dis- 
couragement for the teacher. Eyen when a class has been well organized and ifter- 
est kindled a number of pupils will drop out, to be replaced by others, who are new 
to the work. I see no remedy for this evil in the near future and believe it will 
simply have to be tolerated for many years to come. The weather in this part of 
Alaska is frequently very dismal, the days are so short and it rains so hard and con- * 
tinuously that it isan impossibility for the children to get enough fresh air. The 
larger boys haye changed our small anteroom into a gymnasium, where they have 
excellent opportunity to give vent to their animal spirits. The small boys and girls 
have the schoolroom for their play room during recesses. A large shed in the school 
yard, in which the children could play in bad weather, would be an excellent thing 
for them and would greatly lighten the burden of the teacher. 
“The progress of the pupils has not been as marked as I would have desired for 
reasons already mentioned. All those who were regular made very good progress.”’ 
Juneau, No. 2.—Miss Elizabeth Saxman, teacher; enrollment, 71; population, 
Thlinget. Miss Saxman writes: 
“T have nothing new to report of this term’s work except my effort to have a sew- 
ing class in connection with my regular work. I found to my delight that the girls 
took a great interest in it. I supplied all the materials that were used, such as ging- 
ham, calico, thread, buttons, ete. 
“Tt is almost impossible to keep the native children in school during an entire 
term. Their minds seem to crave a change of work, surroundings, etc., and off they 
go unless anchored by the Mission Home. Education and Christianity must go 
band in hand in accomplishing any good for the natives. The minister must preach 
education just as much as Christianity as the first steps to salvation.” 
Douglas, No. 1.—Miss Kate Spiers, teacher; enrollment, 70; population, white. 
Miss Spiers reports as follows: 
“The transient population incident to a mining town accounts in part for the 
   
-P-A-G-E-135
    
REPORT ON EDUCATION IN ALASKA. 1875 
great difference between enrollment and average attendance. Pupils whose parents 
reside here during the entire year have been exceedingly regular in attendance—one 
pupil, Clair Jones, not having been absent a day in two years. 
“We have had a very pleasant and successful year’s work. The school is well 
graded; a regular course of study followed and promotions made at Christmas and 
at the end of June. The progress in reading, language, and map drawing has 
been marked. The interest of the pupils in music also deserves mention. A choral 
class consisting of fifty voices selected from two Government schools and the paro- 
chial school has been organized. This class sang at various entertainments during 
the year and received especial compliment for its singing at the public exercises on 
July Fourth. 
Douglas, No. 2.—Miss Gertrude H. Spiers, teacher; enrollment, 28; population, 
white. The following is Miss Spiers’ report: 
“Regarding the year’s work which has just closed, there is very little to be said 
except that we have had a quiet, satisfactory, and pleasant year. The patrons have 
continued to be very kind and helpful and have cooperated in all the work. The 
death of our kind friend and committeeman, Mr. Robert Duncan, was a great loss. 
The attendance during the year has been exceedingly regular except in a few cases. 
The enrollment during the winter months was small, as many families spent the win- 
ter in the States. In the spring it was increased to our usual number. The school 
has been quite thoroughly graded, and a system of monthly examinations and reports 
was adopted and used during the spring months. The work in German, bookkeeping 
and drawing has been continued on the same lines as during last year. Some of the 
. pupils now sketch from objects quite rapidly and accurately. A circulating library 
has been maintained for the two schools during the year. Fifty new volumes have 
been added, making a total of 114 books. The school now possesses an organ, the gift 
of our former committeeman, Dr. Campbell.” 
Fort Wrangell.—Miss Nellie Green, teacher; enrollment, 80; population, white and 
Thiinget. Miss Green writes: 
“There were enrolled in my school during the year pupils whose ages ranged from 
4 to 15 years, almost equally divided among whites, Russian creoles, and natives. As 
arule, I find the white children hardest to control. They were kind, however, to 
the native children, and were a help to them in using the English language. The 
Russian creoles in disposition are much like the natives, quiet and happy. In their 
studies they are as bright as the white children, but often lack the energy and inde- 
pendence that characterize the whites. Some of them dislike the natives, I beli¢ve 
because they know that one or both of their parents have Indian blood in their 
veins; many of the children are very attractive; the little native children amused me 
often by their quaint ways. The parents of nearly all of them have been influenced 
by eivilization—many are quite advanced in their studies. Irregularity of attend- 
ance is my greatest difficulty. 
Jackson.—Mre. C. Taylor, teacher; enrollment, 67; population, Thlinget. Mrs. 
Taylor reports: 
“School began September 1, with a very fair attendance. I taught the first 
month at Klinquan, as at that time there were a great many native children there 
and none here. Through the kindness of Mr. Miller I kept school in a room over 
his store. Dry goods boxes furnished seats and desks. The weather was bad and 
the temporary school room leaky. The attendance, while not large, was regular, 
the interest good, and the progress satisfactory. In October I came oyer to Jackson 
and opened the regular school. My school was largest in January. Many visiting 
natives were here at that time who brought their children with them; after January 
the attendance gradually decreased until the close of the term. In the spring of the 
year the natives began their trapping and took their children with them to their 
hunting grounds. After the trapping came halibut fishing, gathering of seaweed,
-P-A-G-E-136
  
  1876 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
etc. This migrating they kept up until July. The children advance very slowly on 
account of this irregular mode of living. When the children are in school regularly 
they learn rapidly, take interest in their work, and are interesting children to teach. 
The general health of the children has been very good. Our school room is warm 
and well lighted. The schoolhouse has had a new coat of paint, which adds much 
to its appearance. We received from the Bureau of Education a valuable addition 
to our library, consisting of a large quantity of magazines and a bound volume of 
Harper's Weekly. Weare all delighted with them, and I am sure they will prove 
of great value and interest both to teacher and pupils.”’ 
Hoonah.—Mrs. J. W. McFarland, teacher; enrollment, 126; population, Thlinget. 
Mrs. McFarland writes: 
“Tn looking over the record of the past year I find much to encourage me. When 
the natives begin their feasting and dancing during the holidays, you may consider 
yourself a successful teacher if you can keep up enough interest to attract any of 
them into the school. I had received a Christmas box which contained a great 
many marbles and other playthings that I used in attracting the boys to school. 
However, this proved to be more of a hindrance than a help, as it became impossi- 
ble to get the boys interested in anything else. We had no regularly appointed 
police in the village this year; consequently it was harder to secure regular attend- 
ance. I have found gymnastics of great help by way of recreation and physical 
culture. The progress of those who attend regularly was very satisfactory. We 
were sorry to lose four of our number by drowning.”’ 
Saxman.—James W. Young, teacher; enrollment, 62; population, Thlinget. Mr. 
Young reports: : 
“We have had a year of quietness and progress. More buildings have been 
erected in the village than during any previous year. You areaware that this place 
was started for the purpose of gathering the Cape Fox and Tongass natives into one 
community, as the superintendent of schools thought there were not enough of one 
tribe to justify the opening of a school for each of them. This plan has been a suc- 
cess so far as the Cape Fox Indians areconcerned. There are old feuds and jealousies 
that have kept them apart; these, however, seem to be quieted down. A few of the 
Tongass tribe have joined us, and more promise to come next autumn. Some of the 
Hydah tribe have also come and cast in their lot with us in order that their children 
may have school privileges. 
“The recent discoveries of gold-bearing quartz in this region have made a great 
demand for laborers, and this, with the high prices paid for furs, has made good 
times for the natives—they all seem to have their pockets full of money. We have 
had very little trouble with liquor during the past year. The Rey. Edward Marsden 
unites with me in excluding it from the community. The natives have improved 
very much in morality, temperance, and intelligence since the school was started.’? 
Kodiak.—Miss Anna Fulcomer, teacher; enrollment, 44; population, Russian cre- 
oles. Miss Fulcomer writes: 
“In regard to my year of teaching in Kodiak, I can say that as a rule the children 
are just as bright as a similar set of children in the States—just as bright and just as 
naughty. My second reader class was the most interesting that I have ever taught. 
It was a large class of boys and girls who, with two or three exceptions, displayed 
considerable rivalry. 1 have never seen so much enthusiasm in children of that age. 
It was most amusing to me to watch the expressions on their faces when the new 
spelling books came. I gave them permission to take them home with them. The 
next morning the books were brought back neatly covered with brown paper in order 
to keep them clean. Much more interest and ambition is shown by the younger 
pupils than by the older ones; they want books and papers to read outside of school, 
and it was hard for me to keep them supplied. In number work they are somewhat 
backward. All had drills in English language lessons, a chart serving as a reader

and as a basis for exercises in the use of English. The attendance decreased rapidly 
during April and May owing to the work they had to do in their homes; hauling 
summer’s supply of wood, fishing, preparing for and attending the Russian Easter 
services.” 
Wood Island.—Robert G. Slifer, teacher; enrollment, 56; population, Russian cre- 
oles and natives. Mr. Slifer reports: 
“The school at Wood Island for the year 1898-99 was held in a room belonging to 
the Kodiak Baptist Orphanage. The desks are made out of rough lumber, and many 
of them have no place in which books can be kept. “That the school is appreciated 
is shown by the fact that pupils have come from distant villages in the Kodiak dis- 
trict in order that they may have school privileges. During the greater part of the 
term a few of the older native children who worked during the day were taught ina 
night school. The majority of my pupils do very good work; many of them excel 
in reading, writing, and drawing. They memorize very well, but few of them have 
the faculty of thinking for themselves, so that it is difficult to teach them arithmetic. 
The attendance was quite regular. The Russian Church holidays did not interfere 
with the sessions of the school to any extent. 
“During the summer of 1898 the natives of Wood Island did not get a single sea- 
otter during their annual hunt, so they have been unusually poor. Some of the older 
boys had to stay out of school to huntand fish. Though discouraging in some respects, 
the work has become attractive to me.” 
Unga.—O. R. McKinney, teacher; enrollment, 36; population, white. Mr. McKin- 
ney reports: 
“School commenced on September 6 with 33 pupils in attendance, but was inter- 
rupted during the latter part of the month by an epidemic of dysentery which lasted 
four weeks. I opened school again on October 24 and continued until February, 
when all the children in the village took the whooping cough, and for nearly eight 
weeks there were no children in Unga able to attend school. I started in again on 
March 27 and continued until May 20, when the mail steamer returned from the west. 
After considering the condition of the children and my own family’s poor health, I 
made up my mind to close the school on the 21st instead of the 30th, and I accord- 
ingly took passage on the steamer for the States.”’ 
Eaton Reindeer Station.—Francis H. Gambell, teacher; enrollment, 11; population, 
Lapp. Dr. Gambell writes: 
“‘As to the school work, I have the honor of making the following report: 
School opened on the 18th of October and closed on the 16th of June, being in ses- 
sion all the time, with the exception of the holidays and a spring vacation of a few 
weeks’ duration. The enrollment consisted of 11 children, ranging from 5 to 16 
years of age, and all guiltless of having spoken English. Their faces were bright and 
expectant as they gathered on either side of a rough table made for the purpose, and 
seated themselves on benches similar, probably, to the school benches of early times 
in other new settlements. Their first lesson was an object lesson, and so was their 
third and fourth, and so have all their lessons been during the whole year. 
“They are apt and quick to learn, and while they are anxious to advance in alk 
their branches, they seem to give particular attention to their writing, in which they 
are very neat and careful. 
“Their attendance has been very good. Sickness alone has prevented them from: 
coming, and in two or three instances I have sent them home after coming, as they 
were not in a fit condition to be in school. They have an average attendance of 97} 
per cent for the whole year, taking the figures from the register. Their punctuality 
has been as good as their attendance. Often during the short winter days I have 
had to light the lamp at the beginning of school, as they would come long before 
the stars had gone out of sight.

» “They haye but few games and play very little, but they are always kind and 
‘affectionate and never seem to quarrel as they mingle together. 
“During the evenings in the fall and winter I have instructed those of the older 
ones who wished to come. While some attended, I think more will attend when 
they realize more fully their need of learning to speak the English language well. 
‘As there have been no natives living near the station, I have had no Eskimo 
children, although some have expressed their desire to have their children attend, 
and probably will move nearer next winter, that their children may come.”

APPROPRIATIONS FOR EDUCATION IN ALASKA. 
For the past six years the annual appropriation for the education of children in 
Alaska has been $30,000, increased yearly since 1895 by the sum of $5,000 from the 
Indian appropriation bill. By strict economy it has been possible with these amounts 
to support the present school system. Within the past three years thousands of 
white men have settled in Alaska, many of them taking their families with them. 
The population of the older settlements has largely increased and several new towns 
have sprung up which are clamoring for school facilities. If Congress regards it as 
the duty of the Secretary of the Interior to continue to provide schools for the white 
population of Alaska, I can not state too emphatically that it is absolutely necessary 
that the appropriation for education in Alaska be largely increased. In order to 
provide school facilities which shall approximate the present needs of the increasing 
population of Alaska an annual appropriation of at least $60,000 is an imperative 
necessity. This is the amount which has been urgently recommended by the goy- 
ernor of Alaska.

  LOCAL SCHOOL COMMIPTEES. 
In order to place the several schools established for white children on the basis of 
local self-government as far as possible, local school committees were organized as 
long ago as 1891 in Sitka, Juneau, Douglas, Fort Wrangell, Kodiak, Unga, and Una- 
laska. Of these committees, some of the members have continued since their first 
appointment in 1891, but a larger number have resigned or moved to other places 
and new members haye been appointed in their steau. The following list shows the 
present membership and the dates of appointment: ?

Resoff, N. B. Anthony, L. R. Woodward; Skagway, Thomas Whitten, E. L. Niskern, 
Walter Church, F. R. Burnham. 
The members of these committees have been of good service to the Bureau of Edu- 
cation, both as correspondents and by acting as auditors, countersigning the bills 
sent in for various local expenses of these schools, inspecting repairs, and giving 
adyige as to measures for the greater efficiency of the schools. 
For the southeastern section of Alaska a local superintendent was appointed as 
early as 1890 and has been in service ever since. The present local superintendent 
is William A. Kelly, of the Sitka Industrial School. His duties are to visit the 
schools, report on their condition, and examine candidates for the position of 
teacher.

PRESBYTERIAN Missions IN ALASKA. 
The Rey. George F. McAfee, superintendent of school work, Presbyterian Board 
of Missions, has kindly sent the following account of the board’s work in Alaska: 
“The Presbyterian Church has had missionaries in Alaska continuously since 1877. 
Mrs. A, R. McFarland has the honorable distinction of being both the first Presby- 
terian missionary, as well as the first white woman teacher in Alaska, being stationed 
by Dr. Sheldon Jackson at Fort Wrangel in the fall of 1877. 
“ Fort Wrangel.—Rey. Harry P. Corser is now in charge. The native church is in 
good condition, the people having greatly improved in manner of life during the past 
few years. A white church has also been organized, and Mr. Corser gives part of his 
time to it. 
“ Haines Mission.—This mission is among the Chilkats near the head of Lynn Canal. 
Rey. W. W. Warne is the missionary in charge. The pupils in the industrial part 
of the school have been transferred to Sitka, where they can be more thoroughly 
trained. : . 
“* Hoonah.—The work among the Hoonahs was undertaken in 1881 by Rev. and 
Mrs. J. W. McFarland. Since Mr. McFarland’s death Mrs. McFarland has remained 
on the field and is now in charge of the Government day school. Rey. Wm. M. 
Carle and wife now occupy the mission house and carry on the work. It is most. 
interesting and successful at the present time. The people are making rapid 
advancement in the Christian life and are showing their faith by their works. 
 
-P-A-G-E-145
REPORT ON EDUCATION IN ALASKA. 1885 
“ Jackson.—This mission to the Hydahs has had no missionary of the board for 
two years. Rev. D. Rankin Montgomery, a recent graduate from the Western Theo- 
logical Seminary at Allegheny, Pa., with his bride, has gone to the field. The mis- 
sion property has been well cared for by friends, and the Government day school 
teacher, who occupies one of the buildings, is especially deserving of praise for her 
interest in the matter. The boarding department of the school was closed two years 
ago and the pupils sent to Sitka. 
“ Juneau.—The native work at Juneau was begun in 1881 by Rey. Eugene 8. Wil- 
lard and wife. The mission is now in charge of Rey. L. F. Jones and wife. It is in 
a very satisfactory condition. There have been over 100 converts during the year. 
The industrial work which was carried on for several years, having seryed its purpose, 
was closed in 1898 and the pupils transferred to Sitka. 
“ Douglas Island.—Many natives are employed in the mines and about the famous 
Treadwell mills. Rey. Mr. Jones, of the Juneau Mission, has opened a work among 
them, placing in charge Mr. Frederick L. Moore, an educated native, who has been 
his efficient interpreter and helper for a number of years. The mission gives prom- 
ise of success. 
“ Juneau (white church).—This is the noted Log-Cabin Church, always pointed 
out as one of the attractions of Juneau. It has been replaced by a beautiful, new, 
modern house of worship, and a neat and commodious manse completes the plant. 
Rey. W. S. Bannerman and wife are in charge. 
“‘Saxman.—Rey. Edward Marsden, the first educated, ordained native minister, was 
instructed to open a mission at Saxman in 1898. The work has been fully as success- 
ful as was anticipated. Mr. Marsden has built a steamer, Marietta, named after 
his alma mater, and by means of it is enabled to preach the gospel to many isolated 
groups of people. 
“Skagway.—A church was established at Skagway in 1898 by the Canadian Pres- 
byterian Church. In 1899 the work came to our body by exchange. It is a flour- 
ishing white church, with house of worship and manse on the way to completion. 
Rey. Norman B. Harrison and wife are in charge. Many a poor, weary, homesick 
Klondiker on his way out or back has found comfort and cheer in this little church 
and home. Skagway is at the head of Lynn Canal and the beginning of the White 
and Chilkoot passes to the head waters of the Yukon. 
“‘Sitka.—The Sitka mission is in charge of Rey. M.D. McClelland. He ministers 
to both the native and white churches. The great revival of the winter of 1899-1900 
brought into the church nearly 100 native souls. The white church is also in good 
condition. 
“Sitka Training and Industrial School.—This work was begun in 1880 by Rey. and 
Mrs. A. E. Austin. It has grown in interest and efficiency each year since its organ- 
ization. As indicated, in connection with Hydah, Haines, and Juneau, the indus- 
trial work among the Alaskans has been concentrated at Sitka. This enables us to 
do better and more thorough work in training the youth for the active duties and 
responsibilities of life. In order that they may meet the changed conditions of life 
made necessary by the influx of white people, the taking up of fishing streams, the 
opening of mines, etc., this more liberal and broader education along both intel- 
lectual and industrial lines was necessary. A common English education is given. 
The girls are trained in the domestic industries so that they are fitted to become 
intelligent housewives. The boys have a training in trades, such as boat building 
and carpentry. They also make all the shoes worn by the entire school. One of 
the most interesting parts of the work is that of settling the graduates who unite in 
Christian marriage in the model village which is on thé mission grounds. The 
terms are so liberal and the arrangement so satisfactory that these young people are 
anxious to avail themselves of the opportunity to secure a home for themselves.

They have without exception so far proven themselves worthy of this effort in their 
behalf. 
“ Hospital.—The hospital work is an important adjunct to the school and mission 
work. It is under the efficient supervision of Dr. B. K. Wilbur, who has associated. 
with him Miss Esther Gibson, as trained nurse. There were during this year treated 
as in-patients, 227, as out-patients, 1,580. 
“St. Lawrence Island.—Mr. and Mrs. V..C. Gambell went to St. Lawrence Island 
in 1894. They returned to the States in 1897, and in returning hither were ship- 
wrecked. Their place was taken by Rey. W. F. Doty in 1898, and he was relieved by 
Dr. Lerrigo in 1899. Mr. Doty returns to the field in 1900. Notwithstanding these 
interruptions the work has gone on successfully. 2 
“Point Barrow.—This, the most northerly mission station in the world, opened in 
1890. Dr. H.R. Marsh and wife have been in charge since 1897. The mission aided 
in the rescue of the icebound whalers in 1898, and received and cared for the rein- 
deer relief expedition. A herd of deer are now at Point Barrow, and the hope is 
that they have passed safely through the winter, and thus this industry will be suc- 
cessfully established in this far-off country. 
“‘ Nome.—There went into the Yukon Valley in 1899 a heroic band of missionaries. 
They were under the leadership of that noted pioneer, Rey. 8. Hall Young, D. D. 
Aiter stationing his associates, Dr. Young found himself icebound at Nome. Like 
an apostle he went to work, and in conjunction with the Congregational missionary 
on the ground did heroic service until he was prostrated with typhoid fever. At 
last accounts he was sufficiently recovered to begin preaching, and doubtless at this 
time—May, 1900—is exploring the unknown regions of the Yukon Valley. 
“Eagle City.—Passing over the ranges with Dr. Young, from Skagway, Rey. and 
Mrs. James Wollaston Kirk found their way to Eagle City, and hung out the banner 
of Christ on the Yukon. Their home is the center of attraction to the weary and 
lonesome miners. Mrs. Kirk’s piano thrills with its sweet sacred music the hearts 
of the men who are so far away from home and loved ones. These two noble souls 
are known and beloved by the miners in all that region around Circle City. For the 
love of Christ and souls these two Christian people were willing to give up their 
delightful home and prosperous church in the city of Philadelphia and go to the 
wilds of the unknown, far-away frozen land. Great was the sacrifice, but greater is 
the reward. 
“Rampart City.—Rey. M. Egbert Koonce, Ph. D., a young man of promise, with 
flattering home offers, turned away from them all and set his face like a flint toward 
the Yukon. His soul was aflame with love for his fellows buried in those northern 
snows, and in the name of his Master he went forth bearing the glad message of 
salyation. He built his own hut, manufactured out of ‘poles and tin cans’ his own 
furniture, erected his house of- worship, hung up the bell, and its gladsome ring 
called in many a poor, lonely miner who by its sound was reminded afresh of home 
and dear ones.’’ 
Grapvates or THE SirKa InpusrriaL ScHoor. 
Mr. William A. Kelly sends the following information regarding the graduates of 
the Sitka Industrial School: 
Srrxa, ALaska, November 25, 1899. 
Rey. SHEipon Jackson, D. D., 
Bureau of Education, Washington, D. C. 
Dear Sir: In accordance with your request of November 4, 1899, I herewith 
send you a list of the*names of pupils who have graduated from the industrial 
school at Sitka, Alaska, and who, at the time I write, are following such trades as 
were taught them at the school, or are profiting by the instructions they received. 
These names represent the three principal tribes of southeastern Alaska, viz, Thlinget,
-P-A-G-E-147
  
REPORT ON EDUCATION IN ALASKA. 1387 
Tsimshean, and Hydah. Many of the pupils whose names are not appended haye* 
earned and are still earning good wages simply by their knowledge of the English 
language by acting as guides, interpreters, and packers for the large number of white 
men who have come into the territory within recent years. Especially was this 
true during the memorable season of 1897-98, when the miners found the assist- 
ance of our boys of incalculable value. The miners found the boys invariably honest 
and trustworthy. 
As far as I can trace them, their names and employments are as follows: 
Boot and shoe trade-—Don Cambren, Sitka; Daniel Shake Ish, Sitka; Chas. 
Kadashan, Haines; Howard George, Sitka; Chas. Willard, Juneau; Abraham Nel- 
son, Gravina; Aaron, Wrangell; Chas. Bates, Metlakahtla; Geo. McKay, Ketchikan;

Of the names of those pupils who are general workers I have not appended any 
list. Many of the names of girls who are not married, but who are at home, 
living sober, industrious, Christian lives, are also not on the list. Enough has been 
sent to show that the Sitka school is an absolutely necessary factor in the lives of the 
young people of Alaska.

CONGREGATONAL MISsIons IN ALASKA. 
By the Rey. CHARLES J. RypDER, D. D., 
Corresponding Secretary, American Missionary Association. 
Cape Prince of Wales is on the point of the peninsula that juts out from north- 
western Alaska. It is the farthest west of any mainland on the American continent. 
A mission was planted here by the American Missionary Association in 1890. The 
point is one of strategic value. Mr. and Mrs. W.T. Lopp have occupied this station 
for ten years. Many of the Eskimos pass back and forth through this portion of 
Alaska and are thus reached by the influence of this mission. During the year 1899- 
1900 both Mr. and Mrs. Lopp haye made excursions on sledges into the north and 
interior regions of Alaska. They have visited the Eskimos on these excursions and 
have become acquainted with their methods of life and general conditions. They 
speak the language of the native people with considerable fluency. This greatly 
increases their usefulness in winning the people and bringing them under the power 
of Christian civilization. 
Two native missionaries have been chosen for special work under the direction of 
Mr. and Mrs. Lopp. Sokweena and Elobwok are the names of these missionaries, 
and they have accomplished a good work during the year. It seems the principle of 
civilization here as elsewhere that only when a native leadership is furnished for the 
people can the mass be reached. Missionaries of a foreign people and tongue may 
bring influences to bear in training a leadership. It is only, however, when this 
leadership is prepared and sent out among the people that the masses can be reached. 
These two faithful Christian Eskimos haye labored during the year with devotion and 
courage. Their influence and work are most encouraging features of this mission. 
Reenforcement of their work is needed. Other mission stations at which a native 
missionary shall gather the people of his own race, teaching them the industries of 
life as well as leading them in intellectual and spiritual development, will doubtless 
open more and more in the future. 
A letter from Mr. Lopp brings the following message. It is the most recent news 
received from this field: 
“Now that the American Missionary Association is out of debt we hope you will 
be able to send us a missionary with a missionary wife to be with us. It is hardly 
necessary for us to cite reasons for this. He should be a minister, if possible. It 
would not be right to subject children of school age to the influences of the life here. 
‘You wrote us up last year as haying ‘no time for gold hunting,’ and yet gold has been 
discovered within a few miles of the Cape. This brings upon us new anxiety and 
greater work. Should these claims turn out well the American Missionary Asso- 
ciation will not be forgotten. < 
“The Bear has made a wonderful cruise this season. I doubt if she ever made a 
longer one. The present captain has made a very conscientious commander, and has 
surely exerted himself to perform his duty vigorously and honestly. He has admin- 
istered the law toward the Eskimos as well as white men, and arrested those who 
were guilty of crime. He was very kind to the natives, giving them help in coming      
-P-A-G-E-149
  
  REPORT ON EDUCATION IN ALASKA. 1389 
from Cape Prince of Wales to this point, and also across the straits to Siberia. 
When the sea was too rough for their skin boats he would have them hoisted up on 
deck. The United States surgeon has also been exceedingly kind to us. 
““We now have 437 reindeer, and haye sent an order signed by Dr. Jackson to ff 
station on Norton Sound for the 277 which are yet due us. These will be driven 
up some time this winter. After they come we will make an estimate of the num- 
ber belonging to the Eskimo boys and mark them. I have taken one new herder 
as an apprentice, and hope to take another or two next year. We sold reindeer at 
$30 per head to the Bureau of Education, which furnished money for training other 
apprentices. Our old apprentices can now pay their own way, and the sale of the 
reindeer in the future will go toward helping new apprentices till they can help 
themselves. 
“The Woman’s Home Missionary Association, of Boston, has contributed toward 
the support of native workers. We received word about it and rejoiced in their 
generous gifts. I will use it in helping support Sokweena at our little mission at 
Mitle-tok. As I wrote last year, we were enabled to start this mission through a 
small contribution of about $25 from the generous Endeavorers of Westboro, Mass. 
Then some other friends sent in a little help that went toward the support of 
Sokweena and his wife. It is not enough, but we will try to make it do forthe 
present. We were unable to visit Sokweena but three times last winter. If we 
could only visit him oftener and help him more he would be able to accomplish 
more. But some of the children at his mission learn to spell and write a little, and 
to sing. We had some very good meetings. Lucy and I went up and stayed three 
days. Wetooka lantern. Many of the old folks had professed Christ and seemed 
to be earnest and sincere in their prayers. The position of Sokweena is a hard one 
at times. 
“Adlooat, one of our brightest boys, was typo and artist for the Eskimo Bulletin. 
We will not be able to get the Bulletin out before November, I am afraid. 
“We have just erected a building 20 by 40 feet, which we have decided to call 
‘Thornton House.’ Itis to be used as a workshop, clubroom, and for other purposes 
for the natives. The need of such a building had occurred to Mr. Thornton and 
myself in 1890. Last year Mrs. Thornton succeeded in gathering $127 dollars, which 
was sufficient to purchase the lumber and pay the freight on it. Two natives and 
myself have put up the building. The natives did most of the work on it, as I could 
not leave our house long at a time.”’ 
This report from Mr. Lopp presents an impressive picture both of the value of this 
work at Cape Prince of Wales and the methods which have been adopted. The 
herd of reindeer has increased largely. The method of herding, using natives for 
such purposes, has familiarized this people with the care of the deer and at the same 
time created in them a desire to possess herds of theirown. This gradually produces 
higher standards in industrial life and larger views. Convenient transportation back 
and forth tends to civilization. An isolated people is generally an undeveloped peo- 
ple. Contact with others, especially those of higher civilization, is the important 
factor in race development. By means of the reindeer these Eskimos go rapidly from. 
place to place and little by little the unfortunate influences of isolation are being 
overcome. 
These reindeer bring also better food both in milk and flesh to the people. Dis- 
eases produced by the large consumption of fat will, little by little, pass away and 
the Eskimos will become physically a stronger people. The very care of such animals 
is also civilizing. It creates gentler characteristics and makes necessary self-control 
on the part of herdsmen. This mission of our Congregational churches at Cape 
Prince of Wales finds large value in the reindeer herds. 
The finding of gold in this part of Alaska brings very perplexing problems inci-   
 
-P-A-G-E-150

dental to such movements. Not only must this mission reach and influence the 
natives, but it must. more and more become a means of grace to the white men coming 
in. Mr. and.Mrs. Lopp are well fitted for these difficult responsibilities, and the mis- 
sion was neyer more needed than to-day. 
Meruopisr Misstons In ALASKA. 
By Mrs. 8. L, BEILER. 
Unalaska.—The Jesse Lee Home has at the present time 27 children. Four have 
returned to their homes on the Aleutian Islands; 2 have married. We have sent 
none to the Government school at Carlisle, Pa., this year. There are already 13 
from our mission at Carlisle, and 1 in Chicago being educated by Mr. P. B. Weare, 
and 1 in Canada taken by the sister of one of our missionaries, who writes: ‘‘ Vasha 
is doing so well. The improvement in her spiritual life was a joy to me.” 
The Eskimos we expected this summer did not come, on account of the crowded 
condition of the Government revenue cutters, which had to care for the Cape Nome 
miners and others who were stranded. We are looking for them next season. 
You ask, ‘‘ What is our relation to the Government school there?’’ None whatever; 
it is entirely separate. About 200 yards from us is the new school building, which 
is used this winter for the first time. Miss Mann is the superintendent. There are 
65 pupils, which includes 30 from the boys’ school connected with the Greek 
Church. Because of this, Dr. Newhall has been requested by the United States 
Government to assist until another teacher can be provided. 
The children from the Jesse Lee Home attend this school, taken to and fro by 
their teachers. The public school teachers have boarded in the home, because 
there was no other suitable place. The self-support is increasing. The past year 
has been the best in this respect. We rented a part of our land to build boats upon. 
Three hundred dollars was received in this way, which has been sent to the treas- 
urer, toward the hospital fund. We find that the cows are self-supporting by the 
sale of milk. 
Industrial classes have been formed and more practical work is being pursued. 
Dr. Newhall has proven of great service in unnumbered ways. He writes: ‘‘The 
attendance at services varies with the number and kind of vessels in port. Great 
interest is taken in the singing of hymns. On a recent Sabbath there were gathered 
together an interesting company—American sailors, miners, and natives. There 
were represented Americans, Englishmen, Norwegians, Irishmen, Swedes, native 
Aleuts, Germans, Creoles, also Indians and a number of native mothers with their 
babes. The Sunday school is in a prosperous condition. During the past six 
months the children have purchased a call bell, blackboard, and crayons, and have 
some money left. 
The Cape Nome gold field has made quite a stir. Thousands of miners have gone 
there this summer in search of treasure. The lowland, covered only by the deep 
and swampy growth of moss, has proven a hotbed of disease, and the unsanitary 
condition of affairs has added to the spread of the disease. Cape Nome fever is rife 
and has taken away many lives. The country is devoid of timber. The supply of 
coal is small, likewise provisions. As a result the miners have overcrowded the 
steamers in order to leave the country. Many will be unable to get out and much 
suffering will result. Two hospitals have been erected, but have not met the 
demand. Every steamer has had many sick on board, and not having sufficient 
accommodations for them, some have been left here at Unalaska. The mission has 
done its share in caring for them. 
A few incidents : - 
Mr. Buckley, age 58, has been up the river six years. The past year he has been

sick with pneumonia, etc., and soon was left without means save the fare to Unalaska. 
While boarding the steamer at St. Michaels at night he was crowded through an 
open door and fell into the engine room far below. Three ribs were fractured. 
When consciousness returned someone had relieved him of his baggage. He had no 
place to sleep save on the floor of the second deck, with only a borrowed blanket. His 
suffering was intense. The ship’s company allowed him to sleep aboard while the 
vessel lay at the wharf, but on her departure his only shelter was a leaky bunk 
house, with the old floor for a bed. On October 1 he came to the mission. We were 
glad to give him a bed and food to eat. The man was suffering much, but soon 
began to improve. Instead of the dirty, rough-looking miner, he became a clean 
and respectable-looking man. He appreciated the kindness shown by helping on 
the chores as his strength would permit. After a stay of seventeen days the United 
States revenue cutter Bear called, and Lieutenant Jarvis kindly gave him passage to 
the States. 
The §. §. Bertha called and had four sick men on board, Would the mission care 
for them? To leave them would mean a chance of life; for them to go on would 
mean a grave in the deep. A room at the Jesse Lee Home was transformed into a 
ward. A sailor was the only one who could be obtained as a nurse. 
One Sunday morning (October 22) at 3 o’clock we were aroused by persons at the 
door. The $. 8. Portlend was at the wharf. An Englishman of wealth had died on 
the steamer. Would the mission receive the body and give it a burial? The service 
was held on Monday evening at 8 o’clock. The room was well filled with officers 
from theS. 8. Roanoke. The choir was composed of Eskimos, Aleuts,and Creoles. In 
the darkness of the night, with the wind and rain to wail their mournful dirge, the 
procession wended its way to the hillside, where the remains of Mr. Girling were laid 
to rest. (Mr. Girling was financial agent of a London company operating in Alaska. )

In the western part of the Gulf of Alaska is a cluster of islands known as the 
Kodiak group. These islands are in the center of the district assigned to the Baptist 
denomination which extends from Mount St. Elias around the Gulf of Alaska to the 
Shumagin Islands, a distance of 1,100 miles. Upon Wood Island, one of the smallest 
of the group, a Baptist mission to the natives of this part of the Territory was estab- 
lished by the Woman’s American Baptist Home Mission Society in 1893. This 
island was chosen because it was the headquarters of the North American Commercial 
Company, who have always been favorable to missionary work. Upon the 4th of July, 
1893, an orphanage was opened, and during the past seven years over 50 children 
haye been cared for; there are at present 28 in the home. This orphanage is under 
the special care of the Baptist women and children of New England who aim to raise 
$5,000 annually for its support. 5 
There have been many changes in the workers in the seven years, but the present 
efficient superintendent, Mr. C. P. Coe, is now entering his fifth year of service. 
The work has steadily grown under his care, and great improvements have been 
made upon the buildings and grounds. The children are bright and intelligent, and 
for the most part interested in their work. After a short visit to the States, Mr. Coe 
returned with his wife and children to Alaska last April. Mrs. Campbell, of San 
Francisco, accompanied them and has proven a very efficient matron for the orphan- 
age. Miss Hattie Denniston is the industrial teacher. In October Mrs. Coe com- 
menced a work she had had in mind fora long time. She invited the native women 
to the orphanage for one afternoon a week to show them how tosew. This class has 
been well attended and much interest taken in the work; the promise of having the

quilt they piece is a great incentive to work. About 30 tons of ensilage have been 
cut during the summer for the silo, and 6 tons of hay placed in the barn; much of 
this was brought in the boat from an island 12 miles down the bay. During the hay- 
ing season our people met with a very sad accident. Conrad Egeter, who had been 
for a number of years in the employ of Mr. Coe and who was a most faithful servant, - 
with a number of the mission boys went to the end of the island to secure the last 
load of hay. Upon the return trip the boat was overturned and Conrad, with one 
of the boys, was drowned. This was the first accident at the mission and has caused 
deep sorrow and gloom. 
The great need at present is for a boys’ dormitory. Until this can be supplied 
Mr. Coe has transformed his own cottage into a place for the boys. He has established 
a reading room not only for the children, but for the natives and for the sailors who 
may be in port. 
The Government has for the last two years sustained a teacher at this place and 
the school is taught in the mission building. Mr. Robert G. Slifer is the Govern- 
ment teacher. 
The first Baptist Church in Alaska was organized in July, 1897, and a church build- 
ing erected. At present the church has ten members; two of the children in the 
orphanage have been baptized during the past year, and three others have been 
received for baptism. This is the only Baptist Mission to the natives in the Terri- 
tory, and is under the care of Mr. Coe, who is pastor of the church. We believe the 
new condition of affairs in Alaska will bring this station into greater prominence in 
the near future. 
Of the good work done in the mission, I quote from a letter of Mr. Robert Slifer, 
the Government teacher, who has spent the winter at the orphanage: 
“The work here is worthy of the attention it is receiving. It is doing a vast 
amount of good. It has never been my lot to meet a people who were so degraded, 
and in many ways so hard to work with, as the creoles of this section. The mission 
children are in most cases the very worst that could be found to deal with when 
they come into the mission; in a short time they are better than the rest of the 39? 
      Moravian Missions iN ALASKA, 
[From the annual reports of the missionaries.] 
Bethel.—The work at Bethel, as in the past so in this year, has been much with those 
who are traveling up and down the river-cr from the tundra to the river. . This 
station from its very location naturally has a wide influence and is admirably situ- 
ated as a center from which to do traveling missionary work. We regret exceed- 
ingly that lack of means has necessitated the closing of the school. If we have the 
children the parents are easy to influence, and the children are likely to remain 
permanently ours. 
In March we had the pleasure of a visit from Brother Rock, of Carmel. His visit 
was prolonged beyond his calculations, owing to the early spring, which forced him 
to remain at Bethel and go home by water. Also in March we were visited by Chief 
Engineer Crow, of the steamer Hamilton, on the Yukon. He put our engine and 
sawmill into good running order free of charge. He came at the request of the 
mission for that purpose, and when finished donated the value of his work to the 
mission. 
On May 27, 1898, the ice on the Kuskokwim broke up, leaving the river free of ice 
in a few days. It froze up again for the winter on October 18, 1898. : 
In August the mission was visited by a party of the United States Government 
Geological Survey, under the direction of Professor Spurr. i 
During the fall and winter several white men visited the mission, chiefly renee 
from Yukon. The high prices caused by the Yukon rush are making themselves 
 
-P-A-G-E-153
REPORT ON EDUCATION IN ALASKA. 1893 
felt on the Kuskokwim. Last year the price of dogs was $6 to $10 each, now it is 
$20. Ready-made furs, wages, etc., are likewise much affected. 
The year has been an active one. Fifteen trips for the performance of actual mis- 
sionary work were made during the year, different brethren sharing in this duty. 
The shortest round trip was 10 miles, and the longest 400 miles, the average trip- 
being 186 miles, and the average absence of the traveling missionary from home was: 
ten days to the trip. 
Owing to a severe epidemic of the influenza the death roll in our villages is very 
large. Thirty-five were buried by one or the other of the missionaries. Quite a. 
number were buried in the non-Christian villages, and for these no reliable data can. 
be given. 
The out-stations—Naposikagamute and Pinehagamute.—Naposikagamute is located 
near us and has always been very indifferent to missionary effort. Last year one of 
the shamans, or ‘‘doctors,’’ said if our missionary would give him plenty of tea he 
would make the people good to us. This year he as well as the whole village want 
a missionary all of the time, and show signs of much deeper interest than in former 
years. Helper Neck, who is stationed at this village and at Pinehagamute, though 
sickly, has labored faithfully and earnestly. He takes down our discourses in his: 
native form of hieroglyphics, and then delivers these sermons to the people. 
The four villages between here and Quinehagamute.—These villages are just opening 
up to missionary influence. Especially among these heathen villages is the use of 
medicine gratifying in its results. The cure of the itch, so common and s0 persistent 
among these people, exercises a great influence over them. There are many schook 
children among them, who, if they could be taken into school, could be readily 
influenced, and not only they, but their parents also. We may say, medicine and. 
the school together are the best means of winning these villages. 
Quinehagamute.—This large village of coast people, ‘‘sea pirates,’’ as one of the- 
captains called them, has been under missionary influence to a limited extent in pre-- 
vious years. Here for about six weeks the missionaries and traders stop each 
spring, while they are waiting for the coming of the vessel. Native missionaries: 
have also been at work for some time at this place. Last year we were encouraged 
by the conversion and baptism of the first resident member of the village, Albert... 
This year we have to encourage us the awakening to the glorious hope of salvation 
of the mother and sister of this pioneer Christian. That other hearts are melting 
under the warmth and light of God’s word is evident from the increased call for~ 
medicine, which means less of superstition and shamaning, and also from a general. 
development of the villages with increased friendliness to the missionaries. 
The helper stationed at Quinehagamute, Stephen by name, has been faithful and 
zealous. ‘Last fall he was called upon to mourn the death of his wife. Our hearts: 
go out in sorrow for him, as he was away both from his and her people when she 
died, and he is left with five small children. He will necessarily have to return to, 
his home village. 
Togiak.—Togiak is a district not properly within the bounds of Carmel or of. 
Bethel, being 130 miles from Carmel and 230 miles from Bethel. The people on this< 
river have sent repeated messages both to Carmel and to Bethel asking that a mis-- 
sionary should visit them, and asking for a native missionary to live on their river. 
Some of the people being related to the Kuskokwim people, they have asked for 
Helper Kawagleg of the Ougavig district. With the consent of the other mission-- 
aries I will send him to visit these people, and will communicate to you the report: 
of his visit by the spring mail. 
Helper David.—It may be wondered what he is doing, as he is in the Bethel dis-~ 
trict. His duties for this year are those of interpreter for Brother Romig. This takes 
the bulk of his time and isa very responsible position. His delivery is excellent, . 
and his ability to grasp the thought and properly render it in order to give it its true~ 
ED 99—VOL 1:-—_88
-P-A-G-E-154
1394 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
weight and value make his services very valuable. We would feel comparatively 
helpless at Bethel were it not for the confidence we have in him to perform his work _ 
in an acceptable manner. 
The medical work.—The medical work has been on the increase each year, but this 
year time has not permitted me to keep a detailed record. 
When we returned from the coast this spring, there were natives from near and 
far to welcome us; people of three tribes, our home people, the Youtes, a few Inga- 
licks, and also a few Kaltchan Indians. These upper Indians had come for medical 
care, some for a distance of 300 or 400 miles. They had hoped to find me at home, 
but as we had gone to the coast, they were compelled to wait six weeks until we 
returned. They had come with the trader and were to return with him. They 
were, however, hopeless cases, and two of them were overtaken by the influenza on 
the homeward trip and died. Our hearts were moved for them. They had come 
through storms and calms, tortured by innumerable mosquitoes and unprotected 
from the rain, to see an earthly physician. They produced from their meager store 
as a present to insure the best attention a well-tanned moose'skin or some deer sinew, 
only to learn through the cumbersome channel of double translations (from English 
to Eskimo and from Eskimo to Kaltchan) that their chances of recovery were few, 
and that their long journey was in vain. Poor people! could they only recognize 
their heart’s condition and seek the Great Physician as they do an earthly one, they 
would not return sorrowing from their search. 
The Bethel missionaries officiated at about 35 funerals, as stated above, but this can 
not be taken as the total death roll. One village of about 100 souls lost 11 of its 
number. We judge that the young and strong that are left will naturally recover in 
more instances, and that the death rate will not be so great. 
Food supply.—The food supply of the natives is annually becoming a graver prob- 
lem. However, the past summer was one in which all who were active could secure 
plenty of fish. But in the spring, before the ice left, one whole family and several 
individuals of other families starved outright. Other cases, which came short of per- 
ishing, suffered severely from lack of food. 
We still look with interest to the domesticated reindeer. As yet no herd has been 
granted us. 
Should mining develop, which it may in time, the natives will have greater facili- 
ties for making a living. However, the remedy of frontier civilization is, as a rule, 
no better for the natives than the disease of idleness and short food supply. 
Carmel.—The mail carriers arrived at Carmel, on the Nushagak River, so much 
earlier than was expected that the detailed reports were not ready. 
Sister King was apparently in better health than at last reports, and was able to 
perform her noble duties (as a nurse) very successfully. She tells of the distressing 
amount of sickness, especially among the children of the natives. The missionaries, 
, through God’s blessing, have been spared serious sickness. Shespeaks very modestly 
of what she has been able toaccomplish. But Brother Rock reports that she has the 
stuff in her of which heroes are made, and relates how she went in a little kayak, 
while the river was filled with floating ice, which might easily have crushed the 
frail skin boat, to minister unto those who were sick and whom she was fortunately 
able to save from death. 
Brother Rock reports how he induced the natives to work for the support the mis- 
sion had to give them, and thus secured a good wood supply for the mission. It is 
interesting to hear that, though they had to work ‘‘like slaves,’’ yet they succeeded 
in raising a spléndid crop of garden vegetables and so many potatoes that they 
actually had some to sell. In this way and in many other ways they try to save the 
board expense, and thus lessen the amount that has to be sent to them from the 
States. 
Brother Schoechert reports that every child in the native community under 2
-P-A-G-E-155
  REPORT ON EDUCATION IN ALASKA. 1395 
years of age died. There are 167 souls in their charge at Carmel proper and nearly 
300 persons, classed as ‘“‘new people,’’ on the Togiak River, who earnestly desire the 
truth as it is in Jesus and who are eager to have a missionary. The white settlers 
greatly appreciate the school. The Greek Church at Nushagak has been left in 
charge of Deacon Kaseveroff and is shorthanded, as the priest has received permis- 
sion to leave. There is a steady growth in the interest of the natives up the river. 
There are, besides Carmel, two out-preaching stations on the Nushagak River and six 
on the Togiak. 
Brother Schoechert describes his visit to Bethel and the mission conference there 
in February, 1899. He speaks very appreciatively of Dr. Romig’s medical work. 
He also mentions the eagerness of the natives to build chapels in certain of the vil- 
lages in that district and that the mission conference had resolved to encourage them 
to do so. 
Missions or THE Proresranr Eprscopan Caurcn rx ALASKA. 
The following extracts are taken from the annual report of the Rt. Rey. P. T. Rowe, 
Bishop of Alaska. 
T left Sitka for a visitation throughout southeastern Alaska. My first stop was at 
Juneau and Douglas Island. The Rey. H. J. Gurr is now the missionary in charge. 
Juneau is growing slowly and seems to be assured of a permanent and stable future— 
more so than any other place in Alaska, as far as I am able to judge. Property ig 
very high. The lots on which our church and mission house stand were purchased, 
less than four years ago, for $375, exclusive of the buildings. To-day they could be 
sold for $5,000. Juneau, therefore, has a future, and I have hope that our church 
will become a strong organization in time. 
St. Luke’s Mission, Douglas City, was visited, services conducted, one person con- 
firmed, and two children baptized. The Rey. Mr. Gurr is attending to the needs of 
this mission, but we ought to have a young man in holy orders to take up this work. 
The place is growing, the population is probably 2,000, and it has every appearance 
of a future. A small chapel is very much needed, and just as soon as there are funds 
enough available will be commenced. At present the services are held in a hall. 
KETCHIKAN. 
This mission is situated on Tongas Narrows and on a very large island—with a 
name quite as large. Itis 15 miles from Metlakahtla and about 100 miles south of 
Fort Wrangell. We have two humble buildings, once Indian cabins, and one of 
these, set up on a point of rocks, is used for a school. »The buildings will hold the 
ground or rock on which they stand, at least. Until quite recently “‘squatter’s”’ 
title was the only title we had in Alaska. Miss Agnes Edmond is the teacher and 
only representative of our mission. 
I arrived in Ketchikan on June 8. I saw that quite a change had taken place 
since my last visit. There were many more men around. The reason of that is 
that the district lying on all sides is highly mineralized, and already some good 
prospects have been discovered. It is entirely a quartz region—copper as well as 
gold. The surrounding country for many miles is being prospected by several hun- 
dred men. I ran across three prospectors in Squawl Arm, Helen Bay, and many 
other places. I visited the men wherever it was possible. I held services in Ket- 
chikan, and the congregations were, with the exception of three or four women, of 
men. They seemed to appreciate the services and wished that I could stay with 
them. But there were other destitute points, the country is great, and as the bishop 
is the only traveling missionary, I had to deny their request and move on. 
I hired a boat, crossed Clarence Straits, and went up to the head of Kasa-an 
Bay, which runs far into Prince of Wales Island. Here is the old village of the 
Hydah Indians. It has a beautiful situation, and the village looks very strange as
-P-A-G-E-156
  1896 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
you approach it. Before every cabin there stand two or three totem poles, large, 
moss-covered, and seem to have stood there for a hundred years or so. The Indians 
were not at home, to my disappointment, but they had left behind four dogs and a 
cat. They had gone to their summer fishing grounds. These Indians have asked 
Miss Edmond to come and live with them and teach their children. They are 
anxious for a mission and are urgent for Miss Edmond to make the beginning. 
They are a superior class of Indians, more intelligent and industrious than others. 
They have been far removed from the trend of civilization, but now that ‘‘propsects”’ 
have been found near their village, they will soon be surrounded with whites. Here, 
as in other sections of Alaska, that means a fearful menace to the native population. 
The outlook is serious, and the need of missions and workers is greater than ever. 
It is to these agencies that the natives are looking hopefully for protection and guidance 
and salvation. May the church realize the importance of these days in Alaska! 
Miss Edmond is willing to go to these Hydahs, but until we have a missionary to 
center at Ketchikan I can not let her go. She not only teaches the children, does 
all the good she can, but she also occupies and protects our property. Thereis a native 
population at this point, and its condition is deplorable. They seem to get liquor with- 
out any trouble. Women and men drink alike. Often do the little children seek the 
shelter of the mission house when their parents get drunk. Moral sense seems dead, 
too. Miss Edmond has done and is doing much among these conditions to inculcate 
a higher sense of morality. 
I visited Squawl Arm and some other points on Prince of Wales Island, then 
sailed over to Metlakahtla and had a very pleasant visit with Mr. Duncan, finally 
reaching Tongas Narrows in time to catch a steamer for the north, and thus ending 
an interesting visit to this part of Alaska. ‘ 
SKAGWAY. 
Since my return from the East in May I have made four visits to this mission, 
which has been in charge of the Rey. L. J. H. Wooden for the past year. On Sunday, 
June 4, I preached, confirmed two candidates, and celebrated the Holy Communion. 
It was a great happiness to have with us at this service the good Bishop of Olympia. 
Skagway is a place of considerable importance. Its people are bright, progressive, and 
enterprising. There is a small church element here, and it is of the very best qual- 
ity. I have transferred the Rey. L. J. H. Wooden to the vacant mission at Fort 
Yukon, so that we have no one in charge at present, but I hope, through the help 
of Mr. Kierulff, to keep up the services until another missionary is appointed. 
Our hospital at Skagway, which was such a blessing to the sick and distressed 
miners a year ago, has continued its.good work under the manager, Capt. F. A. 
Wise, and the highly-esteemed matron, Miss Anna Dickey. A woman’s ward has 
recently been added, and other improvements have been made, so that we possess 
an institution which is a credit to the church and has made a great name for itself 
in these parts. The number of patients has decreased, owing to the better conditions 
of the country and the freedom from sickness. But even now, whenever a man is 
taken sick on the trail his first thought is to reach the hospital as soon as possible, 
for the skill of the physicians in attendance, the efficiency and gentle kindness of 
the nurse, and the comforts of the hospital have become widely known and con- 
firmed everywhere. The craving of these strong men in their sickness for a woman’s 
care, and their dependence on it, is a marvelous and pathetic thing to witness, while 
their gratitude is deep and genuine. We can not be too thankful for this service of 
woman, nor for the church which enables us to carry on such a merciful work. The 
hospital is entirely dependent upon the uncertain ability of the patients to pay, and 
the voluntary contributions of friends outside to meet the cases of charity that are 
always cared for. May I quote the words of Senator J. J. Boyce, of Santa Barbara,
-P-A-G-E-157
  
REPORT ON EDUCATION IN ALASKA. 1397 
Cal., whose son was recently nursed through typhoid fever, contracted on the trail: 
“Under these circumstances, reverend sir, I feel it incumbent upon me to express 
to you my heartfelt thanks for your noble work in establishing, at such a place, such 
a desirable place for the afflicted. * * * During a visit to Alaska, sometime ago, 
I heard many reports of its good work throughout the Territory, and I little thought 
then that I should personally come into contact with this evidence of your practical 
Christianity.” 
Bishop Barker has been kind enough to receive all,contributions for this hospital 
and has continued to disburse the same. From his statement to me, he says that he 
has paid out for—

From Captain Wise I am informed that there have been 121 patients received and 
treated; 19 deaths; that there is charged to charity $1,105. 
The rest of my report will be made up from the letters of the missionaries along 
the Yukon, etc., because I have been unable to visit all these places since my return, 
and partly because I found it necessary to give attention to the work in this rapidly 
developing section of Alaska, ‘‘set in order’’ things that were in need of it, so that I 
might feel free to start on a long and distant visitation, God willing, next spring. 
CIRCLE CITY. 
The Rey. J. L. Prevost has been in charge of the work at this mission up to June 
last, when he left for Rampart City, transferred to that work. Mrs. Prevost and 
children, who are not well, are on their way to the States, accompanied by Mrs. 
Demonet. I commend Mrs. Prevost to the loving esteem and kindness of all our 
church people, for she certainly has ‘‘ endured hardness’’ in that region, and returns 
after a good work, faithfully and bravely done. 
Dr. James L. Watt, whose wife and child are with him, and Miss E. M. Deane, 
“Sister Elizabeth,’’ deaconess and nurse, have had charge of ‘‘Grace Hospital.’” 
Dr. Watt will continue in that work and at the same time act as lay missionary in 
conducting the services. Both he and Sister Elizabeth have written most hopefully 
and enthusiastically of their work. Dr. Wattsays: ‘Our work is looking better and 
brighter all the time; * * * the hospital has been full of patients all the month; 
* * * they are all broke, bad with scurvy, victims of the Edmonton trail; * * * 
steamer which brought these from Fort Yukon made me pay the fare of one of 
them, $12.50.” ° 
STATISTICS FOR HOSPITAL. 
“We have received and treated in the hospital 42 patients, 31 white, 11 Indians; 
total number days of treatment, 832. Deaths, white, 1; Indians, 3. Less than one- 
half paid. Patients treated outside of the hospital were: Whites, 20; Indians, 147. 
Deaths: Whites, 2; Indians, 2. Total visits made, 487. In September last I went to 
Fort Yukon, distance 90 miles, at the request of the Rey. Mr. Hawksley to visit the 
Indians, many of whom were sick. I treated 46 patients and made 116 visits, and 
was gone six days, Again in January, with sled and dogs, I made a journey over 
the ice, temperature from 40 to 50 degrees below zero, to attend to the sick, and also 
Mrs. Hawksley. I treated 15 patients, made 20 visits, remaining five days; was 
three days going and three days returning. It is expensive traveling here, but I 
met the expenses by bringing mail and freight on my sled. I have had successful 
operations for appendicitis and laparotomy, with one exception. These are the first 
of such operations on the river. Our hospital needs are a sterilizer, a good supply  
-P-A-G-E-158

of needles, sutures of all kinds, tonsilotomes, forceps, bone, artery repair, abdominal 
dressing forceps, compressed-air tank, pump and spray tubes for throat and nose, 
silver wire, catgut, silkworm gut, kangaroo tendon, fine suture for intestinal work, 
good reading matter, sheets, towels, etc. 
“The hospital receipts were $2,675.79; disbursements, $2,613.07; the assets, 
$2,783.57; liabilities, $1,242.98. 
“On July 3, I heard that the steamer Sault Ste. Marie was hard on a bar 6 miles below 
Circle City, and that 4 men had scurvy very badly; also little food on board. I 
took medicines and some fresh potatoes, and went in a canoe to their relief.. The 
current was running 10 miles an hour, and we made the steamer with difficulty. 
After seeing to the relief of the men I started for home. The current carried me 
downstream in spite of myself. Finally I made the opposite shore, where the water 
was rushing at a terrible rate. I climbed the bank to pull the boat along, when the 
bank fell in and down I went, with dirt and all, into the water. I swam to the boat 
and pushed it to the shore, where I crawled out. The water was cold and the air 
was colder; between the two*I lost heart and took a rest. We started again, but 
were carried 2 miles down the river before we could reach the mainland. There we 
worked our way along the shore; at 4 in the morning we saw Circle City. I left 
the boat and started out to walk. Word must have been passed to the mosquitoes 
that we were coming and were good to eat, for there were myriads of them at every 
step; for everyone we killed a million seemed to take its place. After falls and 
scratches, with clothes torn and more dead than alive, we roused Sister Elizabeth, 
who gave us something to eat, and I went to bed at6a.m. Such was my trip to 
the relief of these six men 6 miles down the Yukon.” 
FORT YUKON. 
This mission has been in the charge of the Rev. J. Hawksley for the past two 
years. He was obliged to leave and go to the help of Bishop Bompas. He did so, 
to my regret and his own, but his work has been blessed to a very great degree. The 
mission is likely to be a very important center for Indian missionary work for a long 
time tocome. The Indians of Gen du Large, Rampart House, Beaver Creek, the 
Ratband, and Fort Yukon all center here. We havé a small log mission house, 
which is used for school purposes as well as for church services. Mr. Hawksley 
built a mission residence while he was there and I have just received the bill for the 
same, $1,100. He was also obliged to hire a teacher, and paid him $175 for a little 
more than three months’ service, the bill of which I have also received. He strongly 
urges the employment of a teacher, and Bishop Bompas is willing to pay half of his 
salary, $250; but I do not think we should accept his kind offer—it is our work, and 
we should bear the responsibility. He firges sending in a missionary at once—the 
work otherwise would be seriously menaced. I have sent the Rey. L. J. H. Wooden 
to this mission and he will be there by September 1. He reports again the faithful 
and loyal services of William Loola, a native reader, to whom I pay $150; but he 
gives all of his time that he can—often lacks food—so Bishop Bompas increases the 
offering. This I will endeavor to do myself. Mr. Hawksley has failed to send any 
detailed statement of his work, although he informs me that this will come later. 
FORT HAMLIN. 
This is an Indian village about midway between Fort Yukon and Rampart City. 
The Indians are our baptized people, and the only attention we can give them is 
such as Mr. Prevost is able to give occasionally as he passes up and down the river. 
Hereafter he may be able to give them more of his time, now that he is transferred 
‘to Rampart City, at which point he will make his center.

RAMPART CITY. 
It gives me great pleasure to report that Mr. E. J. Knapp, who offered his services 
to me for any place in Alaska that I might choose to send him, and at his own ex- 
pense, has reached Rampart, which is to be the scene of his labors. He writes in 
the most hopeful spirit, and has entered most zealously into the work. He feels 
happy and very much strengthened in the fact that the Rev. Mr. Prevost is to be 
there and assume the charge of the work. 
Rampart City isa mining camp, with small camps or villages of our Indians near 
it. With regard to its future I can not speak. It may to some extent suffer the 
fate of similar camps—here to-day and gone to-morrow. It is this feature or aspect. 
that makes the work in Alaska so trying, difficult, and discouraging. It is a mission 
to a moyement—a procession. Nothing can be more striking than the contrast be- 
tween the conditions of missionary work among wandering bands of Indians, stam- 
peding gold seekers, and that in a settled and populous country. The fundamental 
need and malady are the same, the supply and cure are the same, but the variety of 
conditions, methods, and often of agency, is immense, forever showing the necessity 
of diligent adaptation and watchful supervision. 
We own a mission site with two buildings on the same. The hospital is one of | 
these. It was erected on our lot by Mr. Prevost’s arrangement that the camp should 
put up the building, and this spring we should take it off their hands, paying there- 
for $500, and conduct it as a church hospital. The work is promising; the camp is 
one of 1,500 inhabitants, and these are among the most enterprising, intelligent citi- 
zens of our country, and I can not but rejoice that our church is established in their 
midst. ‘ 
FORT ADAMS. 
Mr. A. A. Selden sends me a very gratifying report of his work. The Indianslived 
in a large number at the mission last winter. School went on without intermission, 
and so pleased were the Indians with the results of its work that at Christmas they 
made an offering of skins, meat, moccasins, etc., amounting to $128, in order that 
Mr. Selden might send out for such school necessities as were required. Mr. Selden 
and Miss Selden do, each of them, a missionary’s work in teaching school, helping 
the natives in all the ways that tell upon their lives and homes and character. In 
addition to the work of holding services and instructing adults, Mr. Selden has before 
him the great task of removing the old buildings—the good ones—to the new site for 
the mission, which is opposite the Tanana River, using the material which was 
bought and brought in by Mr. Prevost four years ago in the erection of St. Saviour’s 
Memorial Chapel, the hospital, etc. Manyare the trials, difficulties, and hindrances 
which he has before him in executing this work. In the first place, it is very expen- 
sive; secondly, he has no stated amount—no funds, in fact—so that he may know how 
far he ought to go. Therefore he has been obliged to use his own judgment and 
‘*do the best he can.”’ I did tell him that he might go to the amount of $1,000 this 
year, and I am now afraid of seeing that bill. The lumber, ete., have to be taken 
up the swift Yukon, labor has to be employed, which in that country of high prices, 
scarce food, ete., is not less than $5 a day, the logs rafted from above the mission 
site and hauled upa steep bank—still, if any one can do it, and can do it for very 
little, it is Mr. Selden. 
The mission had the advantage of having the Rey. Mr. Westley in the neighbor- 
hood last winter, and he celebrated the Holy Communion at times, baptized the 
children, and in many ways proved a help and comfort to the missionary flock in 
the wilderness. 
Mr. Selden made two trips to Rampart City last winter—distance, 80 miles—to look 
after the interests of the church and hold services. He provided food, sled, and

dogs, and sent ‘‘blind Paul’? and Stephen on a journey way up the Tanana to tell 
in the Indian village the ‘‘good tidings’? of a Saviour—tidings which they them- 
selves had found to be so good. They were gone twenty-one days and had visited 
many villages when poor Paul was taken sick. Stephen, afraid that he would die, 
had him carefully wrapped in fur, and started quickly for the mission, reaching it 
only after many days of forced travel. Paul recovered in time, and I gave a heart- 
felt prayer of gratitude to God when I learned that he had; for he is a good man—so 
humble and simple, and yet it is sweet to see his trust and love and faith in God. 
ANVIK. 
I haye received no news from our good friends in this mission, nothing but a letter 
dated at Anvik in February, and received in Sitka, via New York, early in August. 
He reported all well at that date and the mission work progressing. 
POINT HOPE. 
I have not heard from Dr. Driggs since last year. 
Alaska, where ‘‘men are few and miles are many,’’ where sections of it are prac- 
tically more distant than Japan or Africa, where one mission is separated from 
another by hundreds of miles, where the missionary is alone, in a great measure, for 
years at a time face to face with many adverse powers, and his vigorous fight against 
these but invites the enmity of those who are seeking at any price the things of 
this life, with no one from the great world outside to show him that he is sure of 
backing against these odds—no one but the visit of his bishop—Alaska, under these 
conditions, is distinctly a foreign mission, and the board is dealing wisely with it in 
treating it still, in a way, as such. These religious pioneers are conducting most 
faithfully a noble work, and the church must and will hold up their hands—send 
them the cheering and prevailing message, Sursum corda. 
FRIENDS’ MISSION. 
Kotzebue Sound.—The following paragraphs are taken from the report of Mr. 
Robert Samms, one of the missionaries at Kotzebue, which was kindly forwarded 
by Mr. I, H. Cammack, of the California Yearly Meeting of Friends, which supports 
the mission on Kotzebue Sound: 
Perhaps the most interesting item at this time would be a description of our 
journey up the Kowak River. This was undertaken in order to ascertain the con- 
dition, location, and number of the natives living on that river, all of which informa- 
tion was necessary before we could make arrangements for starting a mission among 
the natives in that section of Alaska. This seemed to be a propitious time for such 
a journey, as the white men scattered along the river would be able to help us in the 
way of food and shelter. My wife and I, in company with a man who was carrying 
the mail, left the mission at 7 a. m., December 18, with two sleds and nine dogs. 
The first cabin was 70 miles from the mission, so we had to sleep on the ice three 
nights; rather a cool bed, but our deerskin sleeping bag proved to be a good thing. 
We arrived at the first cabin late in the evening of the fourth day out—worn-out, 
hungry, and foot-sore. The kind-hearted miners sat up all night in order to give us 
the use of their only bed. 
The increasing snow compelled us to leave part of our load and at intervals go 
back and bring it up. In the course of time we reached the lower Penelope camp 
at Hunt River, where a hearty welcome was extended to us. Their easy chairs and 
warm cabin were very much appreciated. After a week’s rest we proceeded on our 
journey with 11 dogs, and ©. C. Reynolds and another man accompanying us. 
Arrangements having been previously made for my wife to remain at their camp and 
teach school, there being about 40 natives living there, we proceeded about 100 miles.

farther and were unfortunate in having our dogs accidently poisoned with strychnine. 
Eight of them died in a short time. Three of these belonged to the mission. “As we 
could neither go ahead nor turn back without dogs, a new dog team was purchased. 
We continued our journey to the Par River, the farthest limit of the native villages. 
Here we found about 280 natives wintering. This is by far the largest village on the 
river, and would be the place for a mission. It is 300 miles from our station here. 
The natives expressed themselves as desirous of missionaries, and promised to build a 
house and assist in other ways. There are about 500 on the river. There seemed to 
be a scarcity of food in all the places on the lower river. Game of all kinds is very 
scarce, and the fish supply is not always adequate. We find plenty of timber for 
fuel and building purposes, but not enough for a sawmill. Perhaps the heaviest 
item of expense in operating in this region will be the transportation. 
We are indebted to many of the miners for kindnesses, and especially to the Pene- 
lope men. 
The hardest thing in the management of the mission this year has been the 
finances, the loss of our goods on the schooner in the fall, and the demands for help 
and hospitality and our trip up the river have amounted to considerable. Our 
return found the natives short of food. We purchased 30 sacks of flour from miners 
and distributed about 800 pounds, taking in pay such things as they had, as seal 
rope, dog feed, some money, etc. It séems to be the general opinion among the 
white men that the only way of solving the food problem is to introduce reindeer. 
We paid $1.30 per sack for the flour, that being the price paid in Seattle last year. 
It has been a great disappointment to us not to have received any mail from the 
States this winter. The mad rush for gold seems to haye blockaded us on the south. 
Tae Swepiso Evaneetican Missron CovENAnt’s Missions IN ALASKA. 
By Rey. D. NYVALL. 
Our work in Alaska has been pursued this year under many disadvantages, 
owing partly to the great influx into northern Alaska of gold seekers and white 
adventurers, putting our mission stations and workers under new and _ difficult 
responsibilities; partly to the necessity for many of our missionaries to return home 
on account of poor health and our inability to find a sufficient number of new mis- 
sionaries and teachers to take their places. 
From Unalaklik both A. E. Karlson and his wife and Miss Malvina Johnson 
were obliged to return home and in their places we could send only one mission- 
ary, Rey. J. F. Qvist, who has been obliged to superintend that station during the 
winter as best he could with the aid of the native workers, Stephen Ivanoff and 
Miss Alice Omigetjoak, an Eskimo young lady, who has been educated in the 
United States for her present work as an assistant teacher. From Golofnin Bay, also, 
both Rey. N. O. Hultberg and Rey. P. H. Anderson returned to the States. In 
their place we had to send Rey. E. J. Henrikson from Yakutat, our southern sta- 
tion, and send to his aid Miss Amanda Johnson, a school-teacher educated at North 
Park College, our school in Chicago. Rev. Qvist is also a graduate from the same 
school. 
Soon after her return to Chicago Miss Malvina Johnson, from Unalaklik, awas: 
obliged to submit to an operation. Although the operation was successfully per- 
formed she was too weak to recuperate and died sometime after. In her death our, 
society lost a most noble and successful missionary, a loss which was felt so much 
more keenly as she was the first missionary in no service of this society who has 
thus departed from the ranks. 
Reports from Unalaklik and Golofnin Bay tell of distress and sickness at both sta- 
tions during the winter, especially at Golofnin Bay, where our interpreter, Gabriel, 
a native, and Miss Amanda Johnson, the new school-teacher, were taken danger-  
-P-A-G-E-162
    
1402 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
ously ill last autumn. Rey. Henrikson was left all alone to do the work and attend 
to the sick ones until he succeeded in getting a physician. In February Miss John- 
son was well again, but Gabriel was still sick and unable to do any service as an 
interpreter. Still, our workers have persevered nobly. If their work has not sue- 
ceeded this winter as it usually has, in many conyerts and in any remarkable increase 
of the church members, it is no less a victory, under the circumstances, that the 
mission has been able to hold its own. 
The native Christians are naturally deeply impressed and not a little alarmed by 
the great immigration of white people to their shores. 
At Yakutat, our station in southern Alaska, our people have been free from the 
annoyances mentioned in connection with the northern stations, but they were last 
autumn greatly shaken up by a terrible earthquake, of which I shall not need to say 
more, as it was so fully described in the papers. Rev. Albin Johnson writes that 
they have experienced smaller shocks now and then during the whole winter, but 
being accustomed to it they have not greatly minded it. Rev. Johnson and his wife 
have been our only workers at that station during the last winter. They report a 
successful season. The congregation numbers 62 members at present. In the Sun- 
day school about 60 children and young people are enrolled and in the day school 
50 pupils. The branches taught in the school are the following: English, reading, 
penmanship, history, arithmetic, English grammar, and the Bible. 
A great improvement in the communications with Yakutat is mentioned by Rev. 
Johnson—namely, that the place has been reached during the whole winter by a mail 
steamer every month, although he reports that these steamers have not been as lucky 
in getting back; not less than three were probably lost on their return trip. The 
report adds that, in consequence of these improved communications, Yakutat has 
been visited by a large number of adventurers whose influence upon the natives is 
always to be dreaded and in some instances has proved to be disastrous. It would 
be a great help to the work of Christian missions and civilization in Alaska if the 
laws of the country could be enforced against acts of brutality and lawlessness com- 
mitted by some of the white people up there against the native, seemingly in the 
belief that Alaska is outside of civilization and life there exempt from the laws of 
decency. 
The missions in Alaska have reason to be thankful to the Congress of the United 
States for the legislation enacted in regard to land held by missionary societies for the 
sake of mission and school work. But of no less importance is the present aid of laws 
enforced to save the natives of Alaska from the fate of becoming, so to speak, buried 
alive in this industrial awakening of their country, occasioned by the late gold discoy- 
eries. The eyes of Christian America ought to recognize above the rich soil of golden 
Alaska the Alaskan himself.

  CHAPTER XXXII. 
NINTH ANNUAL REPORT ON THE INTRODUCTION OF 
DOMESTIC REINDEER INTO ALASKA. 
Department or THE INTERIOR, 
Burnav or Epucation, Avaska Dryision, 
Washington, D. C., December 30, 1899. 
Sir: I have the honor to submit to you my Ninth Annual Report on the introduc- 
tion of Domestic Reindeer into Alaska. 
The year covered by this report has been one of many changes and stirring events. 
The 67 Laplanders, Finns, and Norwegians and their families who were brought 
from arctic Norway in connection with the relief of destitute peoples in the mining 
regions of Alaska, arrived at the Eaton Reindeer Station, Unalaklik, July 30, 1898, 
and on the 31st of January, 1899, they were transferred from the care of the War 
Department to that of the Interior. Thus there was an unusually large number of 
employees during the year in connection with the reindeer herd. The discovery 
and opening of the Cape Nome gold mines caused a sudden demand for transporta- 
tion. The services of all the trained reindeer were required, both of the Government 
and mission herds in the vicinity. The fulfillment of the Government pledge to 
return to the American Missionary Association mission at Cape Prince of Wales and 
to Antisarlook and other Eskimo owners the reindeer which had been borrowed by 
the Government in January, 1898, to carry food to the ice-imprisoned whalers at 
Point Barrow required the return to those several parties of 934 head of reindeer. 
To meet this large demand Congress made a special appropriation of $20,000 for 
fitting out, under the auspices of the Treasury Depa: tment, for the use of the Interior 
Department, the naval vessel Thetis, in order that said vessel might give her whole 
time to the transportation of reindeer from Siberia. Through the courtesy of the 
Treasury Department, the United States revenue cutter Bear was also allowed to give 
some time to securing reindeer. Further arrangements were made with the firm of 
J.S. Kimball & Co., San Francisco, to procure and deliver reindeer in Alaska for the 
use of the Government. 
These several enterprises haye made the year just closed one of great interest and 
activity. 
PERSONNEL. 
  Mr. William A. Kjellmann remained as superintendent. 
Mr. Hedley E. Redmyer, in charge of the special expedition for driving reindeer 
from Haines Mission, on the southeast coast of Alaska, across the country to Circle 
City, having, after great hardship and much personal danger, fulfilled his mission, 
resigned October 10, 1899. 
F. H. Gambell, M. D., remained at Eaton Station as surgeon and school teacher, and, 
during the long absences of the superintendent, as acting superintendent looked after 
transportation and other interests between St. Michael and Nome. 
Herders.—On the 30th of July, 1898, 67 Laplanders, Finns, and Norwegians, with 
1403

their families, reached the.Eaton Reindeer Station. This large number would have 
been required if the original project of taking food during the winter of 1898 into the 
Yukon Valley for the relief of destitute miners had been carried out, but, when hap- 
pily it was found that this measure of relief was not needed and the project of taking 
relief was abandoned, there was a larger number of employees on the hands of the 
Government than was needed. A request was made by the contractor for carrying 
the mail on the Yukon Valley, also by one of the large transportation companies, for 
permission to hire a number of these extra Lapps. Through a combination of cireum- 
stances both the mail contractor and the transportation company failed to carry out 
their intentions. In the meantime a number of the Lapps had caught the gold fever! 
and asked permission to be released from their contract with the Government. As 
they were not needed, their request was granted, and they left the station for the 
mines at Golovin Bay and Cape Nome, as follows:

John Brinterson and E. O. Linblom, discovered the Cape Nome Mining District. It is reported that 
Mr. Lindeberg, during the ninety working days of last summer, took out from the mine as his share 
$200,000 in gold; and it was one of Mr. Lopp’s Eskimo herders at Cape Prince of Wales that discov- 
ered gold on Anacovak Creek, which was the commencement of the new mining district of Konow- 
gok, a few miles from Cape York, on the Bering Sea coast.

Per Johannesen Hatta. ‘ 
In charge of the herd at Point Barrow and Point Hope were Messrs. Lars Larsen 
Hatta and Jacob Larsen Hatta, wife, and two children. 
At Point Clarence was Mr. Per Larsen Anti. 
RENEWAL OF APPOINTMENT AS SPECIAL AGENT OF THE WAR DEPARYMENT. 
As the herders brought from Lapland in 1898 were under contract with the War 
Department until January 31, 1899, and from that time under the Interior Depart- 
ment, on the 21st of April, 1899, I was appointed by the Secretary of War as special 
agent of the War Department for the purpose of closing the accounts of the Lapps 
for salary due under their contract with the War Department for services in connec- 
tion with the Alaska Relief Expedition. During the following September, through 
Capt. E. 8. Walker, Ninth United States Infantry, commanding the post at St. 
Michael, the Lapps were paid the salary due them from the War Department in full 
and receipts were given. 
STATIONS. 
Teller Station.—During the absence of Rey. T. L. Brevig from the Teller Reindeer 
Station I have placed Mr. Charles E. Chard in charge of the buildings. Arrange- 
ments are in progress by which it is expected that Mr. Brevig will return to the 
station next summer. 
Notwithstanding the demand for transportation to the new mines at Nome, I was 
able to secure freight on the supplies for the reindeer stations from San Francisco to 
the Teller and Eaton Reindeer stations at the low rate of $10 per ton, ship measure- 
ment, the prevailing rate being from $40 to $60. 
Eaton Station.—This station, the location of which was selected in the winter of 
1897-98, was not occupied until the fall of 1898. It is situated in a well-sheltered valley 
on the north bank of the Unalaklik River, about 8 miles from the seashore. During 
the winter of 1898-99 the logs were cut in the surrounding forest and whipsawed 
into lumber, from which was erected a large two and a half story main building, a 
large warehouse with a workshop in the basement, together with six double cabins 
one and a half stories high for the herders. 
School.—School was kept by Dr. F. H. Gambell at Eaton Station, as usual, during 
the year, and reports indicate greater progress than during any former year. The 
enrollment consisted of 11 children of the Lapps, with the occasional attendance of 
the parents, the purpose being to assist the Lapps in acquiring the English language. 
They are reported to be very apt and quick at learning, and during the dark days 
of winter would often come to school long before the stars had gone out of sight. 
The character of the pupils makes the school one of more than ordinary interest. 
Medical.—Dr. F. H. Gambell, physician in charge, reports having treated at Eaton 
Station 106 cases during the year, besides numerous minor ailments, such as bruises, 
sprains, ete. Eskimo came to him from Kings Island and the Diomedes, hundreds 
of miles away, by small skin-covered native boats. In the same room have been 
Indians from a long distance up the Yukon River, with Arctic Eskimo and miners 
traveling from the mines on the Yukon across to the new-found diggings at Cape 
Nome. 
HERDS. 
Eaton Station.—The herd at this place numbered 620 adult reindeer and 194 fawns. 
During the summer and winter over 100 animals were broken in and trained to har- 
ness. This served last spring the excellent purpose of teams being in readiness for 
the transportation of the troops to the new mines for the purpose of keeping order, 
the transportation of Lapps, and also provision for the miners. During the summer  
-P-A-G-E-166
  1406 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
96 of the sled deer were left at the Teller Reindeer Station as the nucleus of a herd 
into which could be placed the reindeer brought over from Siberia. During the fall 
the herd was depleted by the sending of 328 head to Point Rodney to replace the 
deer which, in 1898, were borrowed from that station by the Government, so that 
the herd at this station at present numbers but 419. If it were possible to get a cen- 
tral herd of 5,000 head, the increase would be sufficient to do away with the neces- 
sity of further importation from Siberia. 
folovin Bay.—From the 395 reindeer in the joint herds of the Swedish Evangeli- 
cal Union, and Episcopal societies, and Eskimo apprentices, 9 died during the year 
and 157 were born, of which 10 died, leaving at the station 533 reindeer. During 
this winter 159 deer belonging to the Episcopal Society, with 52 deer belonging to 
Apprentice Moses, will be driven to the mouth of the Tanana, in the Yukon Valley. 
There the portion of the herd that is trained to harness will be used during the win- 
ter in the transportation of the United States mail between Tanana and the Eaton 
Reindeer Station. 
One hundred head of deer loaned to the two societies by the Government in 1895 
were returned to the Government in the fall by the societies and sent by the Goy- 
ernment to Antisarlook to replace in part those borrowed from him by the Govern- 
ment in January, 1898. 
During the scarcity of provisions at Nome and the rush of the miners to that 
place the herd at Golovin Bay performed very important service in the way of trans- 
portation. 
Point Rodney.—The herd at this place, numbering 328, belongs to Antisarlook, and 
was given to him in the fall of 1899 in return for those loaned to the Government in 
the winter of 1898. 
Teller Reindeer Station.—Three hundred of the reindeer at this station belonged to 
Tautook, Sekeaglook, Wocksock, and Tatpan, Eskimos who had served an appren- 
ticeship of five years at the station. 
Cape Prince of Wales.—In August, 1898, 167 reindeer were returned to this station 
of those previously loaned to the Government. Of this number 11 died during the 
early part of the winter, leaving 156 in the herd. To this herd were born in the 
spring 79 living fawns, and during the summer 479 deer were brought to this station, 
making the 714 head that were required to replace the 292 and their natural increase 
that were loaned to the Government in January, 1898. The absence of the herd 
during the winter of 1898-99, when there was such a demand for transportation to 
reach the Cape Nome mines, was a loss of several thousand dollars to the Mission 
Station and the Eskimo herders. The herd at this station is the joint property of 
the American Missionary Association and five or six Eskimos connected with the 
mission. 
Point Hope.—The herd at this station belongs to Electoona and Ahlook (Eskimo), 
and numbers 52. It is expected that during the winter 48 additional deer will be 
furnished the young men from the Point Barrow herd. For various reasons this 
herd has not done very well during the past season. 
Point Barrow.—When in the fall of 1898 the shipwrecked whalers were brought 
from Point Barrow to the States on the revenue cutter Bear, 378 deer were left in 
the herd that had been driven to that point for food. During the last spring 118 
fawns were born to the herd. Three deer were killed by dogs and three by wolves 
during the season. At the close of the fiscal year there were at this station 500 head 
of reindeer. Lieut. D. H. Jarvis, commanding the revenue-cutter Bear, during his 
visit to Point Barrow arranged for leaving 100 head of reindeer at that point for the 
Presbyterian Mission, and 25 head for Ojello, an Eskimo apprentice. The rest of 
the herd is to be driven during the present winter, under the care of Mr. William 
Marshall, to Cape Prince of Wales or Teller Reindeer Station, leaving 48 head at 
Point Hope while en route. The total number of domesticated reindeer in Alaska

is 2,837, divided into nine herds. Of the 2,887 reindeer 1,159 are the personal prop- 
erty of 19 Eskimos, who have learned the management of reindeer by five years’ 
apprenticeship at the Government reindeer stations.

REINDEER DISTRIBUTION. 
Instructions were left with Dr. F. H. Gambell, acting superintendent of reindeer 
stations, to procure from Golovin Bay the reindeer belonging to the Episcopal mis- 
sion at the mouth of the Tanana and turn the same over to Mr. N. V. Hendricks, 
agent of the mission. Further instructions were given to renew correspondence with 
the Roman Catholics at Nulato and Koserefsky to arrange for the loaning of a herd 
to the Roman Catholic missions. The Moravian missions on the Kuskokwim were 
notified that they could receive their loan of reindeer during the fall of 1900, at 
which time it is also probable that a herd can be loaned to the Friends’ mission at 
Kotzebue Sound. 
OVERLAND EXPEDITION. 
The following is a statement of the final disposition of the reindeer which were 
brought from Lapland by the War Department for the purpose of carrying relief sup- 
plies to the destitute miners in the Yukon Valley. While procuring the reindeer 
the necessity for such relief passed away, and when the herd arrived in Alaska, not 
being needed for the original purpose, it was turned over by the War Department to 
the Department of the Interior; and I was sent, by the direction of the Commis- 
sioner of Education, to the Alaska coast to receive the deer for the Department of 
the Interior and send them across the country from southeast Alaska to Circle City, 
Yukon Valley. 
The reindeer were landed from the ocean steamer on the 27th of March, 1898, at 
Haines, Alaska. 
Through a combination of circumstances the military authorities were unprepared 
to receive and forward the reindeer to the moss pasturage, 60 miles from the coast. 
While these preparations were in progress the deer were delayed at this point with- 
out moss until the 15th of April, during which time 362 of the herd died. At this 
time the remaining deer were transferred by the War Department to the Depart- 
ment of the Interior, and on the 6th of May following, after great hardships, I suc- 
ceeded in reaching the moss pastures with 185 reindeer out of the 526 that were 
Janded at Haines. 
From this time the deer-were placed in charge of Hedley E. Redmyer, assisted by
-P-A-G-E-169
INTRODUCTION OF REINDEER INTO ALASKA. 1409 
six Lapps, to be driven, when they should regain their strength, across the country 
to the neighborhood of Circle City, in the Yukon Valley. 
On the Ist of September Mr. Redmyer had reached Lake Kukshu, Northwest Ter- 
ritory, with 144 reindeer, 41 of the 185 with which he started having proved too 
weak to recover their strength and died on the way. Of the 144 remaining on the 
1st of September, 3 subsequently died from exhaustion. The balance of the herd 
(141) had regained their health and strength and were in good condition. 
On the 28th of February, 1899, the expedition safely reached Circle City and went 
into camp with 114 reindeer. Of the 30 deer lost by the way, some met with acci- 
dents and were killed; a few were killed by wolves; a few that had strayed from 
the herd were shot by the natives, mistaking them for caribou; a few strayed away 
and were not recovered. 
Mr. Redmyer kept a diary in which he graphically narrates the hardships and diffi- 
culties encountered in driving across an unknown wilderness without roads or trails 
or guide. He states that often a wolf or mountain lion would appear and cause a 
stampede of the herd and compel the Lapps to chase them through miles of unbroken 
snow, woods, and underbrush before they could be gathered together for another 
start. Again and again, coming to ranges of mountains too precipitous to be crossed, 
the expedition was compelled to retrace its steps and try another route; again and 
again, through the delays, provisions ran out and the men were threatened with 
starvation; they were often compelled to lie down to sleep in wet clothing, which 
froze upon their bodies; but notwithstanding all these difficulties and hardships the 
expedition was carried through successfully, and the reindeer proved their ability to 
make a journey that could not have been made either with horses or dogs. 
During the spring and early summer, at the request of the United States Army 
officers stationed at Circle City, two or three distant military explorations were made 
with the reindeer. 
To avoid the expense of driving the herd from Circle City to the Eaton reindeer 
station, 1,000 miles westward, I exchanged the herd with the Protestant Episcopal 
mission at the mouth of the Tanana River for an equal number of deer owned by 
that mission. The deer belonging to the Episcopal mission were at Golovin Bay, 
from which place they were proposing to remove them to the mouth of the Tanana, 
800 miles eastward. 
This exchange was consummated on the Ist of September, 1899, and the reindeer 
received from the Episcopal mission at Golovin Bay were driven to Point Rodney, 
80 miles to the west, to help replace the herd which in the winter of 1897-98 the 
Government had borrowed from Antisarlook for the rescue of the whalers at Point 
Barrow. 
PURCHASE OF REINDEER IN SIBERIA. « 
On the 7th of July, in Baroness Korfg Bay, Kamchatka, 116 reindeer were pur- 
chased and taken on board the Bear by Lieut. D. H. Jarvis, commanding. The 
journey of 900 miles from Kamchatka to Cape Rodney proved to be a stormy and 
rough one, and a large number of the fawns died en route. Upon reaching Cape 
Rodney July 13, the surf was found too rough for landing, and on the 14th anchor 
was hoisted and the Bear went to Port Clarence for shelter. That evening 83 deer 
were landed at Cape Riley, near Port Clarence, from which point they were to be 
driven from 40 to 60 miles across the peninsula to Antisarlook, at Cape Rodney. On 
July 18, 14 deer were landed at Cape Spencer from the revenue cutter Thetis, Lieu- 
tenant Buhner commanding. These deer also were to.be driven to Antisarlook. 
On the 27th of July 15 male and 90 female reirideer were landed from the steamer 
Albion at Cape York, Alaska, for the herd of the American Missionary Association, 
and 67 reindeer were subsequently landed at the same place from the revenue cutter 
Thetis.

REINDEER AND MAIL SERVICE. 
Since the beginning of the introduction of domestie reindeer into Alaska I have 
kept steadily before my mind the fact that sooner or later the reindeer would prove 
a very important element in the rapid transportation of the mail in winter over the 
frozen tundra of artie and subartic Alaska, between the widely separated mission 
stations and isolated mining camps of that region. When, therefore, in the spring 
of 1898 it was announced in the press that the herd of reindeer which had been 
brought from Lapland for the purpose of carrying freight and food to the mining 
regions of the Yukon Valley for the relief of the destitute miners would not be 
needed for that purpose and were for sale, Mr. P. C. Richardson, the contractor for 
carrying the mail through the Yukon Valley, immediately telegraphed me, March 
16, 1898, that he wanted me to reserve him 100 head of reindeer and ali the Lapp 
drivers that could be spared by the Government. In the following June I was 
waited upon by Mr. Richardson and Mr. Emerson, his associate, with the proposi- 
tion that the Government should not only sell them the reindeer needed to carry 
the mail on the Yukon, but also that Mr. William A. Kjellmann, superintendent of 
the reindeer stations, be allowed to take charge of the carrying of the mail between 
St. Michael and the mouth of the Tanana. As the Government had been waiting 
for an opportunity to give a practical test of the utility of the reindeer in mail trans- 
portation, I agreed to their proposition. Through a combination of circumstances 
Mr. Richardson failed to meet Mr. Kjellmann during the summer at St. Michael or 
the Eaton Reindeer Station and consummate the arrangement. 
In the spring of 1899 the North American Transportation and Trading Company, 
which had secured a contract for carrying the mail from St. Michael to Kotzebue 
Sound and Golovin Bay, sublet the same to Mr. Kjellmann, of the reindeer station. 
About the same time Mr. Richard Chilcott, of Seattle, secured a contract for carrying 
the mail from Vaides to Circle City, Alaska, and at the suggestion of the Postmaster- 
General made application for a few reindeer for transportation purposes. His agents 
delayed so late last fall in consummating the agreement that the reindeer which the 
Government had to sell for that purpose were otherwise disposed of, 
During the summer the new gold mines in the neighborhood of Cape Nome had 
proved so rich that a large population had been attracted to the vicinity. In order 
to furnish them,with a winter mail, the Post-Office Department entered into a con- 
tract with Mr. William A. Kjellmann to carry the mail during the winter semi- 
monthly between Eaton Reindeer Station and Nome City. 
REINDEE! 
  TRANSPORTATION OF TROOPS. 
Thé failure to complete arrangements during the summer of 1898 betweén Mr. 
Richardson, the mail contractor, and Mr. Kjellmann, in charge of reindeer, was 
providential. Late in the fall gold mines were discovered on Snake River, near 
Cape Nome, Alaska, and during the winter there was a stampede to the new mines 
from St. Michael, Kotzebue Sound, and the mining districts on the Lower Yukon 
that received the information. The influx of a large population into a region where 
there was an insufficiency of supplies and shelter required the presence of United 
States troops to preserve the peace. An application was made by Captain Walker, 
in command of the camp at St. Michael, to Mr. Kjellmann for transportation, in 
response to which Lapps and reindeer were sent from Eaton Station to St. Michael, 
and transported troops, with their tents, rations, and camp equipage, from St. 
Michael to the Golovin Bay mining region. When there was no longer any need for 
their presence at Golovin Bay the Lapps and reindeer returned the soldiers to St. 
Michael without accident or difficulty. If the reindeer had been engaged in the 
mail service they could not have performed the transportation thus unexpectedly 
required of them.

REINDEER TRANSPORTATION. 
Tn order to further demonstrate the possibilities of reindeer transportation, and as 
an act of humanity and relief to the crowd of miners that had flocked into the Cape 
Nome region and were short of provisions, the reindeer station agreed to transport 
a limited amount of food from St. Michael to Nome, which was done, and payment 
was rendered for the same by the transportation companies, by furnishing necessary 
food supplies to the station. 
REINDEER AS A PACK ANIMAL, 
During the summer Mr. Hank Summers, for fifteen years a miner and prospector 
in Alaska, and secretary of the Pioneer Association of the Yukon Valley, procured 
the loan of a reindeer from one of the mission stations. Upon this deer he packed 
his tent, blankets, provisions, and tools during the entire summer. When not 
engaged in packing his reindeer was picketed out, and everywhere found the rein- 
deer moss—his natural food. Mr. Summers had had many years of long and painful 
experience in packing provisions on his back, and worrying with dog teams. After 
the experience of the summer’s prospecting with a pack reindeer he testified at the 
close of the season, ‘‘I can not say too much in praise of the reindeer; they are a 
decided success; I have never found anything so useful for packing or for food as 
the reindeer.”’ 
REQUESTS FOR REINDEER. 
In the contract made between the War Department and the Laplanders, on Feb- 
ruary 1, 1898, was a clause that, after two years’ service, such of the Laplanders as 
might wish it could have a loan of 100 head of reindeer for from three to five years, 
at the end of which time they would return the 100 head of deer to the Government, 
retaining the increase as their private property. Several of the Laplanders have 
made such requests for the season of 1899. Nearly all of them desired to secure herds 
for themselves and go into the business of raising reindeer in Alaska, considering it a 
much more remunerative field for that industry than Lapland. 
T have also received a petition from a number of miners in the region of Kotzebue 
Sound, who were so impressed by the destitution of the natives with whom they 
were surrounded, and of the relief that would be afforded by the introduction of 
domestic reindeer in that section, that they asked that the reindeer might be thus 
introduced. 
A request has also been received from missionaries in Alaska connected with the 
Swedish Evangelical Union Mission for the privilege of purchasing $20,000 worth of 
domestic reindeer for the purpose of introducing them among the native adherents 
of their mission stations. 
REINDEER ATTRACTING ATTENTION IN CANADA. 
The success of this Government’s introduction of reindeer into Alaska has attracted 
the attention of thinking minds in Canada, and a public sentiment is growing in favor 
of a movement on the part of the Canadian Government to introduce the reindeer 
industry among the Eskimo population in the regions of Hudson Bay, Great Slave 
Lake, and in fact the whole of arctic and subarctic Canada, so that it will not be 
necessary to feed them at public expense, on account of the growing scarcity of food 
supplies in that section. 
REINDEER FOOD. 
During the year interesting letters were received through the State Department 
from Mr. Victor Ek, vice and acting vice consul at Helsingfors, Russia; Edward D. 
Winslow, consul-general at Stockholm, Sweden, and W. R. Holloway, consul-general 
at St. Petersburg, Russia, with reference to the natural food of the reindeer in their 
respective sections of the country.  
-P-A-G-E-172
  1412, EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
RETURN OF REINDEER TO THE AMERICAN MISSIONARY ASSOCIATION, ANTISARLOOK, AND 
OTHERS. 
On January 20, 1898, Lieut. D. H. Jarvis, R. C. S., in charge of the relief expe- 
dition to the ice-imprisoned whalers at Point Barrow, borrowed from Antisarlook, 
an Eskimo living near Point Rodney, Alaska, 133 reindeer; and on January 25, from 
Mr. W. T. Lopp, at Cape Prince of Wales, representing the American Missionary 
Association, 292 reindeer, making a total borrowed for the Government of 425. 
These reindeer were loaned to the United States Treasury Department with the 
understanding that they were to be replaced in the summer of 1898, together with 
the estimated increase in the herd for the coming season, and if for any cause they 
were not returned during the season of 1898, that the increase of the following years 
until the debt was paid be also taken into account. 
In the summer of 1898 there were due, under the above arrangement, to the 
American Missionary Association 432 reindeer and to Antisarlook 218, making a 
total of 645 to be replaced by the Government. The Government, however, was 
unable to procure during the season but 159, which were given to the American 
Missionary Association at Cape Prince of Wales. The delay in replacing the full 
number of deer required still further obligated the Government to take into account 
the natural increase during the spring of 1899. This increased the number to be 
paid to the American Missionary Association to 714, less the 159 delivered in 1898, 
and to Antisarlook 328, aggregating 1,042 head for which the Government was liable. 
This is a striking illustration of the rapidity of increase of the herds. In January, 
1898, 425 were loaned to Mr. Jarvis, and in July, 1899, two fawning seasons hay- 
ing intervened, 1,042 head were required to cancel the obligations of the Govern- 
ment to the above-named parties. This was so large a number it was felt that 
unusual preparations should be made for securing a largely increased importation 
over that of previous years, when the greatest number procured has been less than 
200 head in any one year. Accordingly, on the 24th of January, 1899, the Commis- 
sioner of Education addressed a letter to the honorable the Secretary of the Interior, 
which was duly transmitted to the honorable the Secretary of the Treasury, request- 
ing that instructions be issued to the commanding officer of the revenue cutter Bear 
authorizing him to receive on board the general agent of education in Alaska, and 
proceed to cruise along the coast of Siberia northward for the double purpose of 
securing additional information with regard to Siberian herds of reindeer and for 
the purchasing of the reindeer. In reply the honorable Secretary of the Treasury 
stated that owing to the increase of business in Alaskan waters caused by the present 
mining excitement the Bear would be unable to devote the time necessary to the 
work of obtaining the reindeer, and suggested that Congress be asked for an appro- 
priation for fitting out the naval vessel Thetis, which had been condemned as unsery- 
iceable for naval duty and yet would be seaworthy for a trip like the one proposed. 
Accordingly the Secretary of the Interior, with the cooperation of the Secretary of the 
Treasury, applied to Congress for an appropriation of $20,000 for the fitting out and 
support of the Thetis for this season’s cruise in Alaskan waters. This appropriation 
was granted and the Thetis was placed in commission. 
On the Ist of May, when we were expected to sail from San Francisco, steam being 
got up, it was found that the boiler tubes were leaking badly and that it would be 
necessary to replace them before proceeding; which repairs were at once ordered by 
the Treasury Department. These repairs, however, would delay the sailing of the 
vessel so long that it would be impossible to make the trip proposed to lower Kam- 
chatka, and the cutter Bear, that was ready to sail, was substituted for the Thetis 
between Petropavloysk and Bering Straits. 
To still further increase the number of deer purchased, and as the coast to be visited 
was much greater than any one vessel could efficiently inspect during the few months
-P-A-G-E-173
INTRODUCTION OF REINDEER INTO ALASKA. 1413 
that those shores would be free from ice, I further arranged with J. 8. Kimball Com- 
pany, San Francisco, to purchase, in behalf of the Government, all the female reindeer 
they would deliver on the coast of Alaska during the season. Through the combined 
efforts of the three vessels we secured during the season 322 reindeer. This left 485 
head of reindeer to fully settle up the obligations of the Government to the American 
Missionary Association and to Antisarlook, and these 485 reindeer were taken from 
the Government herd at the Eaton Station. 
REVENUE-CUTTER SERVICE. 
As in former years, so in this, the Treasury Department, through its division of the 
Reyenue-Cutter Service, has rendered hearty cooperation and yaluable assistance; 
indeed, it would have been practically impossible for me, without the transportation 
of a revenue cutter, to have visited the coast of Kamchatka, thereby securing valua- 
ple information with reference to the supplies of reindeer from that section of Siberia; 
also without their assistance it would have been impossible to procure and transport 
the large number of reindeer that were obtained during the season. 
The instructions of Capt. C. F. Shoemaker, Chief of the Revenue-Cutter Service, 
indicated his special interest in the successful securing of a large number of reindeer. 
The same interest was also manifested by Lieut. D. H. Jarvis, commanding the 
Bear, and Lieut. A. Buhner, commanding the Thetis, together with theit officers 
and men in the execution of the above instructions. The carrying out of the details 
of procuring, loading, and landing the reindeer was made the special duty of Lieut. 
E. P. Bertholf on the Bear and of Lieut. H. G. Hamlet on the Thetis. I was also 
indebted for valuable assistance to Capt. W. C. Coulson, R. C. 8., commanding the 
cutter McCulloch, and Capt. W. F. Kilgore, commanding the cutter Perry. 
ITINERARY. 
Under your instructions I leit Washington on April 25, 1899, spending the follow- 
ing Sabbath at Salt Lake and arriving at San Francisco the 2d day of May. 
The revenue steamer Thetis, upon which I was expecting to journey, was under 
instructions to sail on the 2d of May. In getting up steam it was found that the 
boiler tubes leaked badly. Capt. C. L. Hooper, in charge of the repairs of the 
revenue cutters, immediately telegraphed the Treasury Department for permission 
to put in a new set of boiler tubes, which was granted. As this would detain the 
Thetis for a month and would prevent my visiting the coast of Kamchatka to confer 
with the general manager of the Russian Sealskin Company, of St. Petersburg, with 
regard to the purchase of reindeer, I at once telegraphed, asking that the cutter Bear, 
which was ready to sail, might be substituted for the Thetis on the trip to Kam- 
chatka, that I might join the Thetis at Bering Strait, which vessel would then engage. 
for the rest of the season in the purchase and transportation of reindeer. Through 
the kindness of the honorable the Secretary of the Treasury and the hearty coopera- 
tion of Captain Shoemaker, Chief of the Revenue-Cutter Service, this request was 
granted, and instructions were sent to the commanding officer of the Bear to receive 
me on board and convey me to Kamchatka and then coast northward along the 
Siberian coast until the Thetis should be met in the neighborhood of Bering Strait. 
The Bear sailed from San Francisco for Seattle on the afternoon of the 5th of May. 
On the 8th, having completed arrangements with Capt. B. Cogan for the transporta- 
tion of freight and supplies to the reindeer stations on Bering Sea, also with the J. 8. 
Kimball Company for the purchase of reindeer, I took the train for Portland that 
evening. 
On May 10, at the request of the Secretary of War, I called at the First National 
Union Bank, of Portland, Oreg., and completed arrangements for the payment of 
the salaries ofthe Lapps upon my arrival in Alaska. I reached Seattle the following 
evening. 
 
-P-A-G-E-174
1414 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
On the 12th of May the Bear arrived at Seattle and found orders to await the arrival 
of dispatches from Washington. This meant a week’s delay in Seattle. In the 
meantime Capt. Francis Tuttle, commanding the Bear, receiving news that his wife 
was dangerously ill, telegraphed to the Treasury Department asking to be relieved 
from the command of the Bear and allowed leave of absence to return to his family. 
This resulted in another week’s delay, while a captain could be sent out from the 
Atlantic coast. 
On the evening of May 24 Lieut. David H. Jarvis, the hero of the Point Barrow 
relief expedition, arrived in Seattle to take the command of the Bear, which he did 
on May 25. - 
At 9.45 on the morning of the 26th the Bear raised anchor and steamed away from 
Seattle. That night was spent at anchor at Port Townsend. 
On the morning of the 27th, a gale raging outside of the Capes, the captain delayed 
starting until the afternoon. At 2.20 o’clock we got under way for Unalaska, in the 
Aleutian Islands, 
The morning of June 5 we raised land. At 3.15 a.m. Mount Shishaldin, 8,953 
feet in height, was sighted, clean-cut and beautiful against the horizon, covered with 
a mantle of snow from peak to base. A cloud of vapor was floating lazily from the 
crater. At 6.30 Pogrumnoi volcano, 5,875 feet high, came in sight. During all the 
forenoon, which was bright and sunny, with a smooth sea, we skirted the southern 
shore of Tigalda, Akutan, and Avatabak islands, standing for Unalga Pass. Akutan - 
voleano stood out clear and cold, covered with an unusual amount of snow. The 
crater is not at the highest point, but upon the eastern shoulder of the mountain. 
Its location was plainly marked by a large black spot on the snow, made by the snow 
being melted away from the warm rocks that formed the rim of the crater. On the 
west shoulder of the volcano a large pile of perpendicular rocks, forming a small 
mountain of themselves, covered sides and top with snow and ice, glistening in the 
sun, and seemed like a gigantic fairy ice palace. This appearance was still further 
heightened by some bare rocks at the base, giving the appearance of a large arched 
doorway. At the mouth of the pass for a short time the tide rips made a rough sea, 
causing the vessel to roll badly. 
Turning northward into the straits, we passed Egg Island, so called for the 
abundance of the eggs of wild fowl found there. In the distance was the village of 
Biorka, noted as the cleanest village on the Aleutian Island. At 3.15 p. m. we were 
passing the south end of Unalga Island. Off in the distance to the southwest was 
the little village of Biorka. At 3.30 we passed Point Erskine and at 4 we were abeam 
of Kaletcha; soon after the celebrated Priest’s Rock was passed. We entered Una- 
laska Bay, and at 5.15 p. m. made fast to the wharf at Udakhta (Dutch Harbor). 
Three busy days were passed in visiting the Jesse Lee Memorial Home of the 
Methodist Woman’s Home Missionary Society at Unalaska, also the public school, 
and auditing the accounts of Mr. James C. Blaine, who had been in charge of the 
removal of the old and the reconstruction of the new school building. 
At 4.10 p. m. June 8 the ship cast off from the wharf, and, after taking on board 
the steam launch, passed out of the harbor and headed westward for Asia. 
At 2.30, the 9th, we passed the celebrated Bogoslov volcano, 13 miles distant. Our 
route lay to the north, parallel with the Aleutian Islands. These, however, were so 
far distant that only occasionally the peaks of the highest mountains were visible. 
During the morning of the 13th we crossed the one hundred and eightieth degree 
of west longitude, and owing to the change from west to east longitude dropped a day 
in the calendar, making six instead of seven in our present week. At 10.14 a. m. 
on the 14th Attu Island was raised, and at noon we were distant from it about 23 
miles. At4 p.m. Cape Wrangell became visible. A high mountain range seemed 
to traverse the island from south to northwest, covered with snow down to the water. 
The coast seemed to be precipitous and desolate. 
 
-P-A-G-E-175
INTRODUCTION OF REINDEER INTO ALASKA. 1415 
The morning of June 17 dawned with a sky overcast and cloudy. According to 
our reckoning we should have been in sight of the mountains of Asia. We had 
already passed south of Cape Tahipunski (although the fog prevented us from seeing 
it) and were rapidly approaching the mouth of Avatcha Harbor. An anxious look- 
out was kept for the land. At 12.30 p. m. the officer of the deck thought he saw a 
bold headland through the fog. A half hour later there was no doubt about it; 
rocky cliffs loomed up all around us; the great mountain range that incloses the bay 
like a gigantic amphitheater was partially concealed by a curtain of fog. Afterwards, 
when, on the 23d, we steamed out of the bay under a cloudless sky, great precipices 
of rock appeared, walling in the waters of the sea, and great columns of rock rising 
out of the sea stood like eternal sentinels guarding the coast; range upon range of 
snow-covered mountains encircled Avatcha Bay, crowned with the white volcanic 
cones of Wilinchiniski (7,257 feet high), Kozelska (5,333 feet), Avatcha (9,081 feet), 
and Korianski (11,406 feet); we stood as if entranced by the scene. Some day the 
wonderful scenery of the Kamchatkan coast will attract thousands of tourists. Soon 
the light-house on Daini Point, 449 feet above the sea, was made out; the light is 
used from April to October. The keeper’s residence is a long white building with 
its broad side to the sea; a tall white column some distance in front of the residence 
shelters the light. The two buildings are so placed that from the sea they represent 
a great white cross. Later the ‘‘Brothers’’—three great sentinel rocks inside the 
heads—came into view; their tops were alive with sea gulls and sea parrots nesting 
and laying their eggs. Sweeping up the bay and rounding Pinnacle Rock, the small 
village of Petropavlovsky, with its red and green and brown roofs, was seen nestling 
at the foot of the encircling mountains that stood guard around it. Isnenai Bay and 
Point, Rakovya Point and Bay, were successively passed, and rounding to at 4.10 
p. m. we came at anchor off the village cemetery. The ship could have entered the 
inner harbor and anchored within a stone’s throw of the village, but did not. 
We were now in Siberia, the battle ground of the conquering Cossack and free- 
booting Promyshlenki in their century’s march across Asia. In its northern and 
northwestern sections a dreary waste of low rolling and frozen tundra; in its south- 
ern and central sections. rugged snow-covered and storm-swept mountains, the land 
of the fierce howling poorga, of wild beasts and scattered tribes of brave, hardy 
and half-civilized people. 
Directly in front of our anchorage mountain brooks were visible, tumbling down 
the mountain side and running through the village, furnishing in summer, at least, 
an abundant supply of pure water to the inhabitants. Shortly after, Mr. A. Jacovleff, 
bookkeeper of the Russian Seal Company, came on board. He isa Russian natural- 
ized as an American citizen, and is now engaged in business in Siberia. He, how- 
ever, looks forward to making his home in California, where he has spent a number 
of years. He speaks English and Russian fluently, and proved serviceable as an 
interpreter during our stay in port. Before leaying the ship we were invited to call 
upon him whenever we ‘had need of his services. 
After dinner I accompanied Lieutenant Jarvis ashore to call upon the ispraynik 
(governor), who represents the authority of the Russian Government over the 
lower part of the peninsula and is magistrate, governor, and chief of police for this 
whole section. 
Upon reaching the goyernor’s house we found that he had gone out. Leaving our 
cards, we called upon the lieutenant-governor. He also was out. We then went 
to the Russian Sealskin Company’s store, and afterwards returned to the ship. 
June 19, Sunday, after breakfast, we went ashore to attend the Russo-Greek Church, 
morning service being at 9 o’clock. There were about 100 present. The singing 
and chanting were good. Father P. Donskoi, the senior priest, although but 65 
years of age, had the appearance of being 75 or 80. For many years he had made 
3,000 miles a year with dog teams, traveling about his extensive diocese. The hard-

ships of such travel in this semiarctic region have broken him down. During the 
service the communion was administered to some babes in arms. There were no 
seats in the church, and all remained standing during a service that lasted two hours. 
After service we returned to the ship, and soon after Governor Oshurkoff came, with 
Mr. Jacovleff as interpreter, to call upon us. Mr. P. Oshurkoff is a large, well- 
formed man, with a face that indicates force of character. They were accompanied 
by Mr. G. Chupiatoff, agent of the Russian Sealskin Company. 
June 19, after breakfast, the captain and myself went ashore sightsecing, also to 
secure what information we could with'reference to procuring reindeer. Interviews 
were had with the governor, employees of the fur company, and private citizens, 
but the man who could give us the fullest and most reliable information was Capt. 
Philip H. Powers, general manager of the fur company. Captain Powers is an 
American, from New London, Conn., who came out here thirty-five years ago asa 
whaler and has made his home in this section ever since. A few years ago he went 
into the service of the fur company, and step by step has become their general man- 
ager. He now spends his winters in Japan, but was expected to arrive at this port 
in a couple of days. 
The principal objects of interest in the place are a cenotaph sent out from Russia 
and erected to the memory of Bering, who fitted out his expedition and sailed from 
this bay to discover Alaska and explore Bering Sea. His remains are buried on 
Bering Island, one of the Commander group. His cenotaph is in the yard of the 
Russian Church. 
Near by is a monument to Capt. Charles Clerke, who, upon the death of Captain 
Cook, February 14, 1779, at the Sandwich Islands, succeeded to the command of the 
expedition. The exposures and hardships of the expedition in search of the straits 
between Asia and America were so great that his health gave way, and on the 22d 
of August he died at sea off the coast of Kamchatka. He was buried at Petropavloy- 
sky. On a ridge separating the inner from the outer harbor is a monument in 
memory of the French arctic explorer, La Perouse, who visited this place in the 
summer of 1787. He sailed from this harbor over a hundred years ago, called at 
Botany Bay, and disappeared with crew and ship. His monument consists of a 
large rough bowlder set upon a pedestal. Into this bowlder has been deeply carved 
the name and date ‘‘La Perouse, 1787.’? A real anchor and anchor chain have been 
placed across the face of the stone, and the anchor chain encircles the base of the 
pedestal. 
The remaining objects of interest are the remains of the earthworks and batteries 
which were destroyed by the allied fleets of England and France in 1854 and 1855. 
In 1854 the fortifications were shelled and silenced by the allied fleet. Marines and 
sailors were then landed from the ships and an attempt was made to capture. the 
place. As the attacking party was advancing through the woods their officers were 
nearly all killed by sharpshooters, and the troops, thrown into confusion, were 
slaughtered, and a number of them driven over a precipige and dashed to pieces. 
The English and French lost 170 in killed and wounded. Hoisting anchor, the 
fleets sailed away. Returning, however, in 1855, they found the village abandoned 
by order of the Czar. They then destroyed the fortifications and burned the Goy- 
ernment buildings. The fortifications have never been rebuilt. A few troops are 
kept there as a local police force. On a sand spit in the harbor the Russian Govern- 
ment has erected a monument in honor of the victory of 1854. This obelisk, 25 feet 
high, is built of stone, painted black, and surmounted with a gilt star and cross. On 
the eastern side is this inscription in Russian: 
In memory of the fallen 
at the 
Repulse of the attack of the Anglo-French fleet, 
20th and 24th August, 1854. .

INTRODUCTION OF REINDEER INTO ALASKA. 1417 
On the reverse side: 
Erected in 1881. 
In the outskirts of the village there is a well-kept plat of ground in which three 
crosses (one English, one French, and one Russian) mark the spot where the men of 
the three nations were buried. Upon the anniversary of the battle religious services 
are held at the graves. The grounds are kept in better order than any of the yards 
of the citizens. 
The spring has just opened, the buds of the birch and cottonwood are swelling, 
and in sheltered places the leaves are partly out. To-day I saw specimens of the 
famous Yakoot pony, a hardy animal that will find his own food, even in a semi- 
arctic Siberian winter. On this peninsula are said to be large bands of wild horses 
that have started from strayed domestic stock. They would bea good breed to 
introduce into Alaska. The Siberian cattle are an undersized breed, but very hardy. 
June 20: Last night about 11 o’clock the Japanese steamer Setsuyo Maru, in the 
employ of the Russian Fur Company, arrived from the northern coast, where it had 
been locating Japanese and Korean fishermen for the season. The output of the 
fisheries finds a marketin Japan. As the steamer sails from here for Japan an oppor- 
tunity is afforded for sending out a mail. 
After breakfast I went aboard the Setsuyo Maru with Captain Jarvis and called on 
Captain Powers, jr., master. With the exception of the captain all the crew and offi- 
cers are Japanese and Koreans. 
June 21: A rainy day. During the morning I called on Father Donskoi, the old 
Russian priest. His diocese at one time covered all Kamchatka Peninsula and north 
to the Anadyr River. Since 1888 he has been an inyalid. He still, however, has 
charge of the services of the church. His son was a few years ago Russian priest at 
Sitka, Alaska. 
At lla. m,. H.I. M.S. Yakut, of the Russian navy, arrived from the Commander 
Islands and dropped anchor. Captain Jarvis made an official call. 
June 22: The forenoon was cloudy; the afternoon clear, bringing out the snow- 
covered volcanoes and mountain range that surrounds Avatcha Bay as an amphi- 
theater in clear relief around the horizon. It was the first good view of the whole 
horizon that we have had. The scene was one cf marvelous beauty and grandeur. 
The ward-room officers invited the captain and officers of the Yakut to dinner at 5.30, 
after which the officers of the Bear returned with their guests to the Yakut to Spend 
the evening. 
At 7.15 p. m. the steamer Kotik, of the Russian Seal Skin Company, from Japan, 
for which we had been waiting, passed in and dropped anchor. Captain Jarvis 
called on Captain Powers, manager of the fur company, who came on the Kotik and 
arranged for a business interview immediately after breakfast to-morrow. 
June 23: Captain Jarvis had breakfast at 7.30, and soon after 8 a. m. we were on 
board the Kotik and had a satisfactory interview with Mr. Philip H. Powers with 
reference to the purchase of reindeer in large numbers. He had no doubt they could 
be purchased in any number we wished, driven over to a good bay on the Bering 
Sea side of Kamchatka, and shipped to Alas It was arranged that on his present 
trip he would ascertain the cost, ete., and write Mr. Blum, agent of the company at 
San Francisco. 
After finishing our business with Mr. Powers, we went ashore for a final settle- 
ment of bills and a farewell call on the ispravnik. The governor gave Captain Jarvis 
a letter to the starosta (local governor) at Karaginsk, instructing him to give us all 
possible aid in procuring reindeer on Karaginski Island. The starosta is the local 
magistrate and highest Russian officer in the small settlements. At 11 a. m., by 
invitation, Captain Jarvis and myself took breakfast with Commander Noyakovsky, 
R.I.N., of the Russian crusier. His quarters are comfortable; he has an office and 
       
-P-A-G-E-178
  1418 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
dining room, a large bedroom with an iron bedstead, lounge, and a large bath and 
toilet room. The breakfast passed off pleasantly. 
Returning to the Bear we had a call from the Government physician, who hag 
charge of a large region of country. He is employing his spare time in writing a 
history of Kamchatka and its people. I returned ashore with him for a couple of 
charts he kindly offered the captain; also bade adieu to Mr. and Mrs. A. Jacovleff. 
During the forenoon the Bear steamed into the bay, taking various courses to ascer- 
tain the compass deviation. At 3.45 p. m. the anchor was again hoisted, and at 6.30 
p. m. we stood down the bay and put to sea. The sky was clear, and the mountains 
and volcanoes stood out in bold relief against the sky. 
June 24: Last night there was a total eclipse of the moon. At 6.30a. m. we passed 
Cape Shipunski. This cape is a rocky cliff 200 feet high, and extends inland along 
a succession of mountain peaks to Jurnanoya Volcano, which is a rocky cone 10,608 
feet high, and can be seen 120 miles at sea. Avatcha and Korianski volcanoes are 
also visible. During the afternoon Kronotski, 10,608 feet high, was prominent. This 
region is a famous resort for motintain sheep. 
June 25: At 4 a. m. Cape Kronotski was abeam, 12 miles distant. At11a.m. 
sighted Cape Kamchatka. During the day we passed to the westward of the Com- 
mander Islands. These islands belong to Russia and are the resort of the fur seal. 
They are 79 miles distant from Kamchatka and 180 miles from the island of Attu, 
the nearest of the American possessions. They form a connecting link between the 
volcanoes of the Aleutian Islands and those of Kamchatka. Bering, the largest of 
the group, is 50 miles long and 16 to 17 miles wide at the north end, which is the 
broadest point. A chain of mountains, 2,210 feet high, extends the length of the 
island. Bering, the discoverer, died and was buried on the east side of the island, 
about three-quarters of a mile west-northwest of Capé Khitroff. Copper Island, the 
companion island to Bering in the group, is 30 miles long and 5 miles broad in the 
widest part. At the time of Bering’s discovery in 1741 there were no inhabitants on 
the islands. Aleuts were placed upon the islands in 1826 by the Russian-American 
Fur Company for the purpose of procuring seal skins. Fifteen reindeer were intro- 
duced in 1882 and have multiplied until there are now from 600 to 1,000, the increase 
furnishing the inhabitants with fresh meat. The yellow raspberry and whortle- 
berry are found in great abundance. Foxes abound, and, in their season, ducks and 
geese. The present population of the two islands is about 600. The killing of the 
fur seal is done under Government supervision and the skins turned oyer to the 
agent of the Russian Seal Skin Company of St. Petersburg. 
June 26: At 2 a.m. Cape Kamchatka was abeam. This cape is a bold headland 
1,500 feet high, and at its sea base terminates in a pile of rocks 40 feet high which 
has the appearance of a castle with turrets. We are now opposite the mouth of the 
Kamchatka River, the largest stream on the peninsula. On the south side of the 
river, and visible many miles at sea, is a remarkable group of voleanoes—Kluchef- 
skaya, 16,988 feet; Uskovska, 12,508; Kojerevska, 15,400; Tolbatchinska, 11,700; 
Mount Gordon and Mount Herbert Stewart, about 8,000 each. Kluchefskaya is 
more or less active all the time, throwing out ashes two or three times a year, some- 
times covering the earth for a hundred miles around, as in 1879, when ashes fell 3 
inches deep. From the years 1727 to 1731 it was in constant eruption. Beginning 
with September 25, 1737, it burned with such fierceness for one week that the rocks 
appeared red-hot. In 1762 and 1767 other outbursts are recorded, and in 1829 
Adolph Erman, a German scientist, found the burning lava pouring out in a contin- 
uous stream. In 1854 and again in 1885 it was in active eruption—the pillar of flame 
in calm weather being visible for 250 miles. On a quiet day it is reported that 
smoke and steam would ascend forming a perpendicular column thousands of feet 
high. 
An agricultural colony of Russians from the valley of the Lena River were settled

  INTRODUCTION OF BEINDEER INTO ALASKA. 1419 
at Melcova, on the Kamchatka River, as early as 1743. Among the seven church 
hells in the little belfry is one with the date of 1761. 
At noon Cape Oserni, 9 miles distant, was abeam, and the southern end of Kara- 
ginski Island was sighted. The coast line between Cape Kamchatka and Oserni 
was found to be from 4 to 7 miles north of charted position. At 6.30 p.m. we were 
abreast of Cape Nagikinski, which is the boundary line between the Koriaks of the 
north and the Kamchadales of the south. We came to anchor abreast of Vivinski 
village, on the west side of Baroness Korfg Bay. No natives putting off shore for 
the ship, at 10.10 our anchor was hoisted and we were again under way. At 3.25 
p.m. we anchored behind a sand spit which forms General Skobeleff Harbor, in the 
northwest corner of the gulf. At7p. m. Lieutenant Bertholf, Dr. Call, and myself 
went ashore to communicate with the natives. We visited the village at the mouth 
of Kultuznaya River. On our way over Dr. Call shot several eider ducks. Learning 
that a prominent deer man with 2,000 reindeer was a day’s journey inland, we hired 
arunner to go and notify him that a ship was in the harbor and that the captain 
wished to buy reindeer. The villagers were drying fish, long racks of which were 
tobe seen. At 10 p.m. we returned to the ship. At 11.35 p. m. we came to anchor 
off the.mouth of the Karaga Harbor, it being too dark to attempt to enter. Karaga 
Bay is 9 miles long and from 4 to 8 miles wide. 
June 27: Temperature, 56°. The morning was foggy. Two parties were sent out 
in small boats to make soundings to find the best way into the harbor. After lunch 
the steam launch was put into the water and Lieutenant Bertholf, Assistant Engineer 
Lewton, Dr. Call, and myself, with a rowboat in tow, at 1.45 p. m., started 
ashore to communicate with the natives and get the starosta or headman of the vil- 
lage to go with us to Karaginski Island for reindeer. Within a mile of the shore, at 
the upper end of the harbor, the steam launch got aground and could go no farther. 
We then transferred ourselves to the rowboat and started for the mouth of the river, 
the village sought being 2 or 3 miles up the river. As we were passing a small fish- 
ing village the natives raised a flag and signaled us to come ashore, which we did, 
although the water became so shallow that those who had on rubber boots reaching 
to the hip were compelled to get out and help pull the boat over the shallow places, 
To our gratification we found the man we were looking for at this village. The vil- 
lage consisted of several earth huts for the people, and eight or ten storehouses raised 
on poles, beyond the reach of the dogs. These storehouses had conical roofs thatched 
with wild grass. Dr. Call secured some photographs, and later in the afternoon I 
secured for the Alaska Society of Natural History at Sitka a good specimen of one 
of these notched logs that serve as a ladder. Having completed our arrangements 
with the headman and a friend who wished to accompany him to the herd, in half 
an hour we returned to the beach. The sailor in charge of the launch, misunder- 
standing the orders given him, had steamed back to the ship. Rowing was hard 
work; we had a head wind and strong tide against us, and soon decided to go ashore 
on the sand spit and camp until the steam launch should return in search of us. 
A good fire of driftwood was soon burning, water was boiled for tea and coffee, 
bacon was fried to a crisp, sundry cans were opened, and with good appetites we sat 
down in the sand to enjoy our lunch. After lunch those who had guns strolled off 
after wild ducks. About 9 p. m. we saw through the fog the smoke of the steam 
launch, and at 10 o’clock we were again aboard the ship, having had an enjoyable 
afternoon. 
June 28: Temperature, 51°. The fog lifting; pleasant day. At 7.10 the anchor 
was raised and we steamed away for Karaginski Island, reaching there at 11.35 
a. m., and anchoring in Lozhnuikh Vyestei Bay. 
While we were at Petropavloysk the trader of the Russian Sealskin Company sta- 
tioned at Karaga had arrived and had informed us that on this island was a herd of 
3,000 reindeer. According to his statement, about twelve years ago the ice between 
 
-P-A-G-E-180
  1420 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
the Karaginski Island and mainland became so firm that a band of reindeer had 
been driven across to the island, and these had increased until now there were 3,000. 
He said that the Koriak owners, being cut off from all markets, would make haste 
to let us have all we could carry in return for the supplies with which we could 
furnish them. At Karaga the starosta (Russian official) whom we had brought with 
us to the island placed the number of reindeer at 2,000 head. That there might be 
no unnecessary delays, the trade goods were brought on deck, the litters for carrying 
the hobbled deer and sling for hoisting them on shipboard were made, and the pens 
cleared out for their reception on deck. Lieutenant Ulke and Dr. Call were sent 
ashore to procure the headman of the island and bring him aboard. At 4.15 p. m. 
the boat returned with the leading deer owner. He was furnished with crackers and 
a cup of hot tea in the pilot house, and the captain proceeded to negotiate for the 
deer, when, to our extreme disappointment, we found that the people had no rein- 
deer to spare; that while it was true that a year ago they had from 2,000 to 3,000, 
during last winter an epidemic had broken out among the deer and there were but a 
few over a hundred left. All our expectations were in a moment dashed to the 
earth. He was willing to let us have five, but as it would require three days’ time 
to go to the herd and drive them to the sea, we could not afford to wait for so few. 
The people seemed very poor. The population of the island numbers 27. The island 
is about 60 miles long and traversed by a snow-covered range of mountains 2,000 feet 
high. Foxes, bears, and ptarmigan are found upon the island. Reindeer moss 
abounds everywhere. 
June 29: At 5.15 a. m. we got under way for Karaga to return the starostas, Ivan 
and his friend. Anchorage was reached at 9.35 a. m. The steam launch, with 
steam already up, was lowered into the sea and Lieutenants Bertholf and Gamble, 
Dr. Call, the two Koriaks, four sailors, and myself started with the steam launch 
and boat in tow for the shore at 9.55. Within 2 miles of the village the water shoaled 
until the steam launch could go no farther. Dr. Call, Ivan, and I got into the dingey 
with the understanding that when we reached shore we would send the dingey back 
for Lieutenants Bertholf and Gamble. When we were about a mile distant from the 
village the dingey went aground. Dr. Call, having on rubber boots, and Ivan waded 
ashore, while the two sailors and I sat two hours in the boat until the tide had turned, 
and with considerable lifting and pushing the boat was once more got afloat. We 
then returned to the steam launch. Putting the other native ashore on the sand 
spit, we returned to the ship, arriving at 3.40 p.m. At 3.55 p. m. we were under 
way down the bay and out to sea. 
June 30: At 9.45 a. m. we came to anchor abreast of Vivinski village, on the west 
side of Baroness Korfg Bay. No natives putting offshore for the ship, at 10.10 a. m. 
the anchor was hoisted and we were again under way. At 3.25 p. m. we anchored 
behind a sand spit which forms General Skobeleff Harbor, in the northwest corner 
of the gulf. At 7p. m. Lieutenant Bertholf, Dr. Call, and myself went ashore to 
communicate with the natives. We visited the village at the mouth of Kultuznaya 
River. On our way Dr. Call shot several eider ducks. Learning that a prominent 
deer man with 2,000 reindeer was a day’s journey inland, we hired a runner to go 
and notify him that a ship was in the harbor and that the captain wished to buy 
reindeer. ‘The villagers were drying fish, long racks of which extended along the 
beach. At10>p. m. we returned to the ship. 
Summary for June: Traveled 2,921.4 miles; under steam and sail 1,722.9 miles; 
coal used, 164.713 tons. 
July 1: Skobeleffi Harbor. Warm, sunny day. At 1.50 a. m. Lieutenant Ber- 
tholf, Engineer Spear, Dr. Call, and myself went ashore at the village to hire the 
natives to gather grass or moss for the reindeer while en route. Had lunch on the 
beach and returned to the ship at 4.20 p.m. After dinner Dr. Call ard Lieutenant 
Bertholf went ashore to communicate with the natives. They found that the run-
-P-A-G-E-181
INTRODUCTION OF REINDEER INTO ALASKA. 1421 
ner sent last night for some cause had only gone part way to the deer man and then 
returned. Another runner was secured and started off. Lieutenant Ulke went 
hunting and returned with some ducks. 
July 2: Beautiful day. Temperature 63. Spent the day quietly reading. As 
usual on Sunday, we distributed reading matter among the crew, sailors, firemen, 
and cooks. 
July 3: Two deer men came off this morning and news was received that there 
was a Russian trader at the village on Sibir Harbor, across the bay. After breakfast 
Lieutenant Bertholf, Dr. Call, and myself went in the steam launch to fetch the 
trader. He was found and brought off to the ship as interpreter. Dr. Call could 
talk Russian with the trader, and he in turn could talk Koriak with the natives. 
While on shore Dr. Call took a number of photographs. In the village were two 
large tents covered with reindeer skins and a large sod house used as a store, which 
was without windows, all the light being received through the open door. The con- 
tents of the store were a few boxes of trade goods and large piles of furs—bear, fox, 
squirrel, wolverine, ermine; also swan and reindeer skins. 
Upon returning to the ship it was learned that the runner who started off on 
Saturday night to notify the deer man while en route had meta bear which had 
killed his dog and had so frightened him that he had turned and fled. Immediately 
two other men were secured and started off. A conference was held in the pilot 
house between the captain, myself, and the two deer men. They looked over samples 
of our barter goods and discussed the matter somewhat with Peter, the trader. It 
was anew problem to them. They had frequently slaughtered deer and sold them 
for food, but had never been asked to sell their deer alive to be carried off they 
knew not where. They finally concluded not to come to any decision until the 
arrival of the third deer man, and they had had an opportunity of coming to an 
understanding among themselves. In the meantime a number of sacks were sent 
ashore to be filled with food for the reindeer while en route. 
After dinner Peter, the Russian, and the deer men were taken ashore to wait until 
the arrival of the third man. 
July 4: Rained all day. No natives on board. It was the most quiet day we have 
had on the trip. At noon a salute of 21 guns was fired in honor of the day. In the 
evening the launch was sent over to the village to learn if the third deer man had 
arrived. No tidings yet. 
July 5: Launch was sent early to get news of the deer man. At 6.30 p.m. the 
launch was sent again. No tidings. The captain has concluded that he can not 
wait longer. One of the deer men has agreed to let us have some reindeer without 
waiting on the others. His herd is a few miles down the bay, and we will go there 
early to-morrow morning. 
July 6: Hove anchor at 6 a.m. and got under way. Crossed over to Sibir, on the 
northwest side of the bay. Peter, the interpreter, and three Koriak deer men were 
brought on board. At 7.41 a.m. we were again under way for the reindeer herd, on 
the east side of the bay, which was reached at 11.35 a.m. The interpreter and deer 
men were at once landed. At 1 p.m. I went ashore and remained on shore until 
work was stopped in the evening. Fifty-three reindeer were received on board dur- 
ing the afternoon, after which, up to 10.30 p. m., the Koriaks were being paid off 
for their deer. 
July 7: At 6.30 a.m. Lieutenant Bertholf and the men went ashore for deer. 
Received on board 47 reindeer. At 11.30 the deer men came aboard for pay. At 3 
p. m. the steam launch and boats were sent ashore for more deer and moss, and at 
5.45 returned with deer, the interpreter, and three Koriaks, who wished to return 
with the ship to Sibir. At 6.35 under way. At 10.10 we came to anchor at Sibir. 
The three deer men that came with us were paid off in barter goods for their rein- 
deer, which took until 1.30 a. m.

1422 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
July 8: At 7.40 a. m. Lieutenant Bertholf, with the steam launch towing cutters 
and men, left for the village across the bay to procure moss. At 8 a.m. a boat was 
sent to fetch Peter, the interpreter. Peter and Ahlaticah came aboard, and at 9.35 
a. m. the ship got under way. Came to anchor at 10.30a.m. During the day the 
leading deer man in this region, and the one for whom we waited in vain all the 
week, arrived and remained on shipboard until we were about to go to sea in the 
evening. He had a little boy with him about 10 or 12 years old. At 8p. m. Lieu- 
tenant Bertholf and men returned to the ship, haying secured 296 bags of moss. At 
8.40 hove anchor and returned across the bay. Peter, Ahlaticah, and attendants 
were sent ashore at 9.20 p. m., and at 10.15 p. m. we started for the sea and Alaska. 
July 10: Six fawns died from seasickness and were thrown overboard. In the 
evening sighted land (Cape Navarin). The cape is formed by a range of mountains 
extending seaward and ending in a peak 1,690 feet high, from the eastern flank of 
which the rock descends almost perpendicularly into the sea. It is surrounded by a 
group of peaks ranging from 1,200 to 2,300 feet high. 
July 11: Having crossed the one hundred and eightieth degree of longitude, we 
changed from eastern to western time, makinga day. At 8 p. m. land was sighted 
on the Asiatic coast, and at 10.30 p. m. St. Lawrence Island was sighted. 
July 12: At 7.05 a. m. dropped anchor at Indian Point. A large number of natives 
came aboard the ship, among them being Koharri, who has a herd of reindeer. He 
promises Lieutenant Jarvis to let him have some for the Government. Both Koharri 
and his adult son were under the influence of liquor. At 11.35 a. m. hoisted anchor 
and steamed over to Gambell, St. Lawrence Island, where we dropped anchor at 
5.20 p. m. Lieutenant Bertholf and myself at once went on shore, the lieutenant 
taking a number of empty sacks with him for moss for the reindeer. After distrib- 
uting the sacks among the natives we proceeded with Mr. Doty and Abrahamsen, 
who had met us at the landing, to the mission houses. As Mr. Doty’s and Abra- 
hamsen’s time had expired they immediately commenced preparations for depar- 
ture. The house was fastened up and their baggage sent to the landing. In the 
meantime word had been sent to Lieutenant Jarvis that some of the natives had 
secured whisky from the whalers and one had attempted the life of the missionary, 
in response to which an officer and some sailors were sent ashore to arrest Captain 
Jack (Sablah), the guilty one, and take him to the ship in irons, which was done. 
Mr. Doty reported that from the latter part of April to the early part of June there 
was an epidemic of influenza, which had affected every person in the community. 
During the prevalence of the epidemic there were 7 deaths in a population of about 
300; 5 of these deaths occurred within forty-eight hours, and 4 of the sufferers had 
been killed by their relatives and friends at their own request. One of them, a 
blind man, had his friends place a rifle so that he could discharge it with his foot, 
and then shot himself. Another man, after certain heathen ceremonies, was shot 
by his sister-in-law. A man and woman were strangled by hanging. All these per- 
sons were sick and asked to be killed. Itis their belief that when sick and about 
to die if they, or their friends for them, take their lives they will thereby escape 
the deyil and go direct to God. Therefore this killing is regarded as a favor. After 
a person is thus killed his relatives and those that assist make great lamentation 
over the deceased. It is rarely that a man is strangled at St. Lawrence Island. He 
is either expected to take his own life with a knife or rifle or have his friends do it 
for him: In the above cases Mr. Doty had been informed of what was about to take 
place, but his protests and expostulations were of no avail. The influenza extended 
also along the Siberian coast. It was reported that at Indian Point 6 adults and 18 
or 20 children died, and that among the reindeer men inland from the point there 
had been 60 deaths. Probably many of these were assisted deaths. Captains S. F. 
Cottle and B. T. Tilton, of the whaling fleet, report that on the Diomede Islands a 
woman was hung and a man stabbed by their friends.

  INTRODUOCTICN OF REINDEER INTO ALASKA. 1423 
The whaling vessels Jeanette, Grampus, Thrasher, Bowhead, Belvedere, Fearless, Alex- 
ander, and Wm. Bayliss had called at Gambell. The Belena, Bonanza, and Narwhal 
passed without stopping. The Albion, with freight and the cutter Thetis, had also 
called. Charles E. Buckler, captain of the Wm. Bayliss, who had been drinking 
hard, accidentally shot himself and was buried at St. Lawrence Island. Mr. Doty 
conducted the funeral services. Four whales had been taken by the fleet up to June 
20. They also had done a large amount of trading. At Gambell the natives secured 
one whale by hunting and another was found dead in the ice and the bone secured. 
Two whales floated ashore, but the bone had been removed. It was reported that 
one whale had been captured by the natives at Indian Point, one near St. Lawrence 
Bay, one at East Cape, and one at Plover Bay. At the latter place five boat loads of 
natives off whaling were gone five weeks and given up for lost. They had subsisted 
on raw walrus meat. The whaler Alexander, in 1896, took down a head of bone for 
Kelly & Siem from the Government reindeer station at St. Lawrence Bay, Siberia. 
At 10.85 p. m. we hoisted anchor and steamed for Point Rodney, Alaska, where we 
expected to land our reindeer for Antisarlook. 
July 13: Rained all day; dropped anchor off Point Rodney at 9 p.m. Surf too 
high for landing. 
July 14: Being too rough to land the deer, at 6.30 we hoisted anchor and started 
for Port Clarence, dropping anchor at the sand spit at 1.15. The following vessels 
were at anchor: Bark J. D. Peters, with coal; steamer Balena, schooner J. M. Coleman 
(coal and supplies), Wm. Bayliss, steamers Grampus, Narwhal, and Thrasher. 
Finding Per Larsen Anthi (Lapp) and Tautook (Eskimo) at the spit, Lieutenant 
Jarvis employed them, with two Eskimo assistants, to drive the herd of deer across 
to Charlie’s, about 40 miles distant. At 4.25 p. m. the anchor was hoisted and we 
steamed up the bay to Cape Riley, where the reindeer were landed. After dinner I 
went ashore and remained until all the deer (83) were landed. Returned with Lieu- 
tenant Bertholf and the sailors to the ship at 1.15 a. m. 
July 15: At 8.10 the anchor was hoisted and we steamed across the bay to the 
Teller Reindeer Station, where we anchored at 9.45. Lieutenant Bertholf was sent 
off with the steam launch to visit schooner Mary Bitwell, that had gone ashore near 
Grantley Harbor. In the meantime supplies for Tautook that had been brought up 
from San Francisco were ‘broken out’? and preparations made to land them at 
Teller Station. The surf was so rough that this was given up and at 4 p. m. anchor 
was hoisted and we returned to the sand spit, where we anchored at 5.30 p. m. 
Several whaling captains came on board to call upon Captain Jarvis. Mr. Charles 
E. Chard, applying for permission to occupy one of the buildings at Teller Station, 
he was permitted to use the log schoolhouse until June 30, 1900, upon condition that 
he take charge and care of all the other buildings belonging to the Government at 
the station. Four boat loads of natives who wished to return home to Cape Prince 
of Wales were taken on board and their umiaks hung to the davits. 
July 16: At 2.50 a. m. we got under way for Cape Prince of Wales, where we 
anchored at 8.30 a.m. The water was so rough and the surf so bad that only one of 
the native boats made the. attempt to land. They had great difficulty in getting 
ashore. As it was impossible to land the supplies or communicate with shore, and 
fearing to miss the revenue-cutter Thetis, that was at St. Lawrence Island, the captain 
concluded to run oyer to St. Lawrence Bay, Siberia. At 10.50 a. m. the anchor was 
hoisted and we got under way. At 11.55 we met the Thetis coming to Cape Prince 
of Wales with 14 reindeer. We turned around and returned and anchored at 2.10 
p. m. off the village. After anchoring, Lieutenant Hamlet brought off a small mail 
for the Bear. Learning that Dr. Call was very sick, he returned to the Thetis and 
brought off Dr. Hawley. The waves were running so high that the Bear had to get 
under way and take Lieutenant Hamlet and his boat to the windward of the Thetis
-P-A-G-E-184
    
1424 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
to enable hiin to get back to his vessel. As the motion of the ship was injurious to 
Dr. Call, at 7 p. m. we started to return to Port Clarence. 
July 17: The sea was so rough and the current so strong that we were twelve 
hours steaming 60 miles, reaching anchorage at Port Clarence at 7.13 a.m. The 
day was rainy and stormy. At 7.40 p. m. the revenue-cutter Thetis arrived from 
Cape Prince of Wales. 
July 18: At anchor off Point Spencer. Immediately after breakfast went over to 
the cutter Thetis to confer concerning reindeer with Captain Buhner. There were 
14 reindeer on the Thetis, and fodder exhausted. As there was a herd of reindeer 
on shore (which he did not know), for the purpose of receiving small lots of deer 
Lieutenant Hamlet and myself went ashore to hunt up Dunnak and Sekeogluk 
(reindeer men) and make arrangements for landing. As the Thetis was a long dis- 
tance from the landing place anchor was hoisted and the vessel steamed abreast of 
the point of landing. Immediately after 12 o’clock the 14 deer were loaded into 
two boats and Lieutenant Hamlet and I again went ashore. The landing was made 
without difficulty and the deer driven off to the herd by Dunnak and Sekeogluk. 
After dinner I went to the Thetis, and in company with Lieutenant Hamlet went 
in search of a young Siberian from Whalen, known as Chio, Captain Buhner need- 
ing him as interpreter in the purchase of reindeer. It was from two to three hours 
before we secured him as interpreter. 
During the afternoon I took ashore and left in Dunnak’s tent for Per Larsen Anthi 
the following supplies: One sack of flour, 2 pounds ground coffee, 5 pounds of sugar, 
6 cans roast beef, 3 cans condensed milk, 5 pounds butter, and 25 pounds of salted 
pork. 
July 19: At anchor at Point Spencer. After breakfast received on board, from 
the whaling bark Mermaid, Frank Temple for transportation to St. Michael, he hay- 
ing assaulted with a knife and cut Clutchpid, of that vessel, July 6. He was placed 
in the forehold in double irons. Clutchpid also was taken on board and placed in 
charge of the surgeon. 
At 11.30 a. m. we got under way for Teller Reindeer Station, where we anchored 
at11.10a.m. <A native boat was loaded with supplies belonging to Tautook, which 
had been paid him for services connected with the relief expedition to Point Barrow 
in the winter of 1897-98. Went ashore with the boat and inspected the Government 
buildings at Teller Reindeer Station. They are already commencing to run down. 
At 1.15 p.m. we got under way for Point Spencer, stopping at 1.25 to board the 
schooner Jessie, of Los Angeles. At 3.15 p. m. anchored at Port Clarence. Lieuten- 
ant Bertholfand the master at arms left the ship to arrest As-sher’-ruk, who murdered 
Frank Boyd, a miner, on the Noatak River, in the fall of 1897. At 4p. m. they re- 
turned with the man in double irons. He was also imprisoned in the fore hold. 
At 6.58 we got under way for Cape Prince of Wales with four boat loads of Eskimos. 
A native from the Diomede Islands, Noo-var-loo, while drunk shot Arkiard, a 
Diomede boy, but he escaped before he could be arrested. e 
June 20: Came to anchor at Cape Prince of Wales at 12.35a.m. Got up and 
dressed so as to be able to see Mr. Lopp, the missionary at that point. The sea 
proving too rough to land supplies, we lay at anchor all day. Mr. Lopp came off 
and spent the day and night on the ship. Stormy and unpleasant day. 
July 21: At anchor off Cape Prince of Wales. During the night the sea calmed 
down, so that very early in the morning the landing was commenced of the stores 
which had been brought to pay Mr. Lopp’s herders for their trip to Point Barrow 
in 1897-98, in the relief expedition. The supplies having been landed, Mr. Lopp 
bade us good-bye, and at 8.55 a. m. the anchor was hoisted and we steamed away 
for Cape Blossom, Kotzebue Sound. 
July 22° This morning about 8 o’clock we met the schooner General McPherson, 
loaded with miners en route from Kotzebue Sound to Cape Nome. As the schooner
-P-A-G-E-185
    
INTRODUCTION OF REINDEER INTO ALASKA. 1425 
had been taken off last fall contrary to the orders of the owners, and a warrant 
being out for her seizure, Lieutenant Jarvis arrested the captain and placed Lieuten- 
ant Ballinger on board with instructions to convey the vessel to St. Michael and 
deliver it up to the court. It proved to be a warm, pleasant day. At 4.20 p. m. the 
ship anchored off Cape Blossom and very soon after, in company with Lieutenant 
Bertholf and Dr. Hawley, I was on my way to the settlement, some 12 miles dis- 
tant, which we reached about 8 o’clock. As we came abreast of the Quaker mis- 
sion, where from 200 to 800 miners were assembled, they gave three hearty cheers 
at our arrival, knowing that the steam launch had on board their first mail this 
season. We soon learned that the Kotzebue mining district had not met expecta- 
tions. There were from 350 to 400 miners in the camp, three-fourths of whom had 
had the scurvy, and many of them were destitute. There had been a large number 
or deaths from scurvy, drowning, and freezing. They were sick, without means, 
and disheartened. Lieutenant Bertholf and the surgeon immediately proceeded to 
investigate the condition of things, while I spent the time at the mission. Toward 
morning the lieutenant came in and announced that he would take off to the Bear 
83 of the worst cases of scurvy. At 5a. m., having been up all night, a start was 
made to return to the ship, but the tide being out the steam launch was soon aground 
and the party returned to the village. The lieutenant then hired a small stern- 
wheel steamer to take the miners off to the Bear. We finally left the shore about 
10.15 a. m., and reached the ship soon after noon. The captain, hearing of the sad 
condition on shore, sent the steamer back for others. 
July 23: At 1.30 p. m. the steamer Arctic Bird arrived, bringing 33 scurvy-stricken 
men to the Bear. The men were taken on board and the steamer sent back to the 
camp for another load. It was a beautiful day—temperature 55—mosquitoes very 
bad on shore. I regretted that I could not have remained on shore to attend the 
Eskimo service of the Quakers and also preach to the miners. 
July 24: At 3.45 a. m. the steamer Arctic Bird arrived with 48 men, 2 women, and 
1 babe, all destitute. At 5.20 a.m. we were under way for St. Michael. A fine 
day. During the day we passed a number of small boats with miners, en route 
from Kotzebue Sound to Anvil City. 
July 25: About 6 a. m. passed Cape Prince of Wales. The Bear swung around by 
Cape Spencer to see if the bark Alaska was in Port Clarence Harbor. Not seeing it 
(afterwards it was learned that it was there waiting for the Bear), the Bear con- 
tinued on to Synrock, Antisarlook’s place, where we anchored at 8.30 p. m., in the 
lee of Sledge Island. The supplies brought up from San Francisco for Antisarlook, 
due him for his trip to Point Barrow in the overland relief expedition of 1897-98, 
were landed. Upon the return of the boats Antisarlook, wife, and child came 
aboard to go to St. Michael. While on shore the officer learned that Asheuk, the 
Diomede murderer that shot and killed Naribuck, a boy, at Point Spencer on the 
15th and then escaped, had left there only a few hours before. 
July 26: At 12.30 a.m. the Bear was under way. At 6.40 a. m., seeing a native 
camp on the beach, Lieutenant Bertholf went ashore and found and arrested Asheuk. 
At 7.40 a.m. we got under way, taking in tow the seized schooner General McPher- 
son, which we had overtaken. At 10.50 a.m. we anchored abreast of Anvil City, 
the new village which has sprung up in connection with the Cape Nome placer 
mines. At 11.30 went ashore with Lieutenant Bertholf. Our boat got aground in 
trying to cross the bar at the mouth of Snake River, and it was with difficulty that 
we got ashore. Met Mr. Redmyer, assistant superintendent of reindeer, who had 
come down from Circle City; also Dr. Kittlesen and Messrs. Andersen and Elliott, 
of the Swedish mission at Golofnin Bay. Learning that Mr. Kjellmann was at the 
mines, some 5 miles away, I sent a Lapp with a note for him to come at once to go with 
me to the reindeer station. Mr. D.H.Smith, United States deputy marshal, and the 
principal owner of the schooner General McPherson, in company with an officer of 
ED 99—VOL IL 90   
 
-P-A-G-E-186
1426 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
the Bear, went aboard the schooner and arrested Capt. J. B. Neilson, who had stolen 
the schooner in the fall of 1898. Jeremias Abrahamsen, whom I had brought from 
St. Lawrence Island, was given his discharge from the Government service and 
allowed to go ashore. Messrs. Kjellmann and Redmyer came off for passage to St. 
Michael. At 7.40 p.m. we got under way for St. Michael. Nome (Anvil City) is a 
conglomeration of tents, with half a dozen frame houses or shanties, and two or 
three iron warehouses in process of erection by the transportation and trading com- 
panies. The ocean front is staked out with claims for from 10 to 20 miles. We saw 
men panning out gold on the beach in front of the most densely populated part of the 
place. Some fine teams of horses were being used in hauling. 
July 27: A beautiful day. At 10.15 a. m. anchored at St. Michael. The place had 
greatly improved since I left it last September. The cutters Corwin, Rush, and 
Nunivak were in the harbor. Went ashore with the first boat, and at once proceeded 
to military headquarters to arrange with Capt. E.S. Walker, Eighth Infantry, U.S. A. 
for the payment of the Lapps by the War Department. 
July 28: A beautiful day. All day on shore attending to business. During the 
forenoon Mr. Gray, as agent of the North America Transportation and Trading Com- 
pany, sublet to Mr. William A. Kjellmann the mail route between St. Michael, 
Golofnin Bay, and Kotzebue Sound. Mr. Hendricks and I went on Mr. Kjellmann’s 
bond. Returned to the ship at midnight. Mr. William F. Doty left the Bear and 
took up quarters at Hotel Healy. 
July 29: Fine weather continues. All day on shore attending to business. About 
11 p. m. Captain Walker took me off to the ship on the army steara launch. The 
trade of St. Michael has greatly changed since a year ago. Then there was a rush of 
miners up the Yukon River; now very few are seeking passage up that river, but 
thousands are coming down, some to leave the country in disgust and others to try 
the Cape Nome mining district. The up-river business is now mostly freight. 
Owing to the decrease of the passenger traffic, many of the small river steamers are 
laid up. The harbor is full of them. 
July 30: After lunch I went ashore to attend divine service, held in the dining 
room of the Hotel Healy, and conducted by Rey. Loyal L. Wirt, territorial superin- 
tendent of Congregational missionary work in Alaska. About one hundred persons 
were present at the service, which was of great interest. The theme of the discourse 
was, ‘‘Christ the wonderful.”” After service I returned to the ship. 
July 31: During the night there was a change of weather. A storm commenced, 
with a low barometer, which increased during the forenoon to a gale. During the 
night the Yukon River steamer Jessie, of the Alaska Commercial Company, went 
ashore with three barges, loaded with military supplies for Colonel Ray. At 5.30 
a.m. the Bear commenced dragging its anchor and was thumping on the bottom; in 
half an hour we were under way, and at 6.45 a. m. anchored in deeper water. The 
gale increasing, at 10 a. m. we were again under way, seeking shelter behind Egg 
Island, where we dropped anchor at noon. In the harbor at St. Michaela large 
number of vessels dragged their anchors and a number of the smaller boats went 
ashore. Toward evening, the force of the gale being spent, the Bear hove anchor at 
8.40 and returned to St. Michael at 10.15 p.m. The depth of water in the harbor 
was lowered 5 feet by the storm. 
August 1: Went ashore on the first trip of the steam launch and was very busy 
with Captain Walker, U. 8. A., completing the drawing of checks for payment of 
Lapps. At 4.30 p. m., with Mr. Kjellmann, returned to the Bear on the army 
steam launch, and at 4.50 we were under way for Unalaklik. A boat was lowered, 
and Mr. Kjellmann and I were sent ashore with the mail. On shore we fortunately 
found five Lapps and a boat from the station. They were routed out of their tent, 
and preparations were made to proceed at once up the Unalaklik River 8 miles, to 
the Eaton Reindeer Station. As we left the ship a steady rain commenced, which
-P-A-G-E-187
  
INTRODUCTION OF REINDEER INTO ALASKA. 1427 
lasted until we reached Eaton. A piece of driftwood was laid across the boat and a 
tarpaulin stretched across, which formed a shelter from the rain. Under this shel- 
ter Mr. Kjellmann and [I crawled. Innumerable mosquitoes also sought shelter 
under our improvised tent. Mr. Kjellmann made an ineffectual attempt to drive 
them out with tobacco smoke; failing, he resigned himself to his fate and went to 
sleep. I alternated my time between fighting mosquitoes and sitting in the rain. 
August 2: At 5a. m. the night trip closed with our arrival at Eaton Station. Dr. 
F. H. Gambell had given up our coming and had gone down to St. Michael to meet 
us, and we had passed on the sea. Dr. Lerrigo was awakened, and soon we had a 
good warm breakfast. After breakfast the Lapps were summoned and the payment 
of their salaries from July 1, 1898, to January 31, 1899, by the War Department, was 
commenced. Thus, with the signing of vouchers and arrangements for the deposit 
of their surplus salaries in banks to their credit, the whole forenoon was consumed. 
After payment closed I had the 12 children of the settlement brought into the 
schoolroom, heard them recite and sing and made each the present of a picture book. 
After dinner supplies were got out for the reindeer herders in the arctic, and at 1 
p.m. we were off on our return to the ship. A stop was made at Unalaklik to call on 
the missionaries of the Swedish Evangelical Union, where we were presented with 
beautiful bouquets of wild flowers and a box of fine radishes from their gardens. 
After our arrival at Eaton, in the morning, the rain ceased and the sun came out. 
When we started on our return in the afternoon the rain again set in and lasted until 
our arrival at Unalaklik. While at Eaton Station a fishing party returned with the 
seine. When they were asked what success they had had, they replied, ‘‘ Not much, 
only a hundred salmon.” At5 p.m. Mr. Kjellmann and I reached the ship with 
supplies for the overland expedition which was to drive a portion of the reindeer 
back from Point Barrow to Cape Prince of Wales, and also with barter goods for 
the reindeer trade of the Thetis. At 5.45 p. m. we were under way for Nome. 
On the 24th of December, 1898, Klemet Nilsen had died at the Eaton Station. 
August 3: At 1,55 p. m. we anchored abreast of Nome. The sea was rough and 
badly breaking on shore. Captain Jarvis and Mr. Kjellmann went ashore and got 
wet in the breakers. The place was wild with the large returns being received both 
in the gulches and the black ruby sands on the shore. 
August 4: During the morning Mr. John W. Kelly came aboard to be taken to 
Point Hope, where he will make headquarters for taking the census next winter 
_ between Point Hope and Cape Prince of Wales, including the Kotzebue country. 
At 10.20 a. m. the ship got under way, and at 1.30 p. m. stopped at Synrock to place 
Antisarlook (Charlie) and his family on board his umniak, which had come out to 
meet him. As we passed Cape Spencer a dense black cloud hung over Port Clar- 
ence, where the Thetis was at anchor waiting for us. 
August 5: At 1.20 a. m. we came to anchor off Cape Prince of Wales. Going on 
deck about 6 a. m. I was surprised to find that Mr. W. T. Lopp was on board. 
During the forenoon Mr. Lopp, Captain Jarvis, and I had a conference with regard 
to the reindeer. The bark Alaska and river steamer John Riley were also at anchor 
in the roadstead. I wrote two or three letters to send by the John Riley to the post- 
office at Nome. In the afternoon Captain Jarvis and I went ashore with Mr. Lopp. 
Took a look through the village; returned on shipboard about 5 p.m. Mr. Sum- 
mers, a mining expert, whom the captain had brought up from St. Michael to pros- 
pect some mines that Mr. Lopp and his herders had found, was sent ashore with Mr. 
Lopp. At 5.45 p. m. we were off for Port Clarence. 
August 6: Reached Port Clarence early in the morning (3 o’clock), where the 
Thetis was waiting for'us. As it seemed best that the rest of the cruise should be 
made on the Thetis, during the forenoon I transferred from the Bear to the Thetis. 
The wind was fresh and the sea rough. 
August 7: During the forenoon my trunk and personal effects were brought over, 
 
-P-A-G-E-188
  1428 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
from the Bear to the Thetis; also the reindeer barter goods brought from the Eaton 
Station. Captain Buhner during the morning furnished rations on shore for Per 
Larsen Anti, who is keeping a herd of reindeer at this place. Upon going ashore 
found that the herd had been removed to Cape Riley. During the day the Bear 
went over to Cape Riley to water. 
August 8: At4 a.m. received word from the Bear that Anti was out of rations. 
As the Thetis was prepared to go to sea, Captain Buhner hove anchor at 4.30 a. m. 
and steamed down to Cape Riley, where we dropped anchor at 7a.m. I was at once 
sent ashore with a boat and crew and left rations for Anti. He himself was away from 
camp after some straying reindeer. Returning to the ship, we were soon under way 
for sea. In the evening we passed King Island and saw the cutter Bear at anchor. 
August 9: About noon passed Indian Point. At 9.55 p. m. we dropped anchor at 
Port Providence, Plover Bay. A boatload of natives visited the ship. Learned that 
there was a large herd of reindeer 30 to 35 miles to the westward. 
August 10: Left our anchorage at 5.05 a.m. During the morning we stopped to 
communicate with some natives who rowed out to meet us. They also testified that 
there was a large herd to the westward. Reaching the bay where the herd was sup- 
posed to be, the ship anchored at 4.20 p.m. Lieutenant Hamlet, Chisthe (inter- 
preter), and I went ashore, where we met the reindeer men. Their herd was five 
days’ inland and they declined to drive it down to the coast. Thus again our hopes 
were blasted. A few miles farther west another herd was reported. In attempting 
to launch the boat from the shore it swamped in the surf, and I was wet through 
and through. Had difficulty in getting through the surf. Returning to the ship at 
7.05 p. m., we were under way for the next herd, but the fog setting in thick, at 
8.25 p. m. we anchored for the night. 
August 11: At 8.05 made a start and at 10.55 a. m. anchored off Managen, where 
a number of deer men’s huts or tents were seen on shore. Soon after a boatload of 
natives came off to the ship and we heard again the same story. They had deer and 
would like to trade, but their deer were pastured many days distant and they could 
not drive them down to the coast. Being convinced of the uselessness of further 
search along the north shore of Anadir Gulf, at 12.55 p. m. we hove anchor and 
steamed away for St. Lawrence Island. A beautiful day. 
August 12: At 7.40 a.m. dropped anchor on the northeast side of the point at 
Gambell, St. Lawrence Island. The wind shifting, we hove anchor and steamed 
around the point and anchored on the southwest side. Went ashore to the Mission 
Station and brought off a lot of reindeer barter goods that were not needed at this 
point, but were needed at the Eaton Station. The wind increasing and being a head 
wind, we lay at anchor until 7.25 p. m., when we put to sea and steamed away for 
Teller Reindeer Station. 
August 13: Head wind and sea, making about 3 miles an hour; I was seasick all 
day. Distributed magazines to the crew. 
August 14: At 11.15 a. m. dropped anchor abreast of Teller Reindeer Station, Port 
Clarence. Went ashore with the carpenter and nailed up all the doors but one of 
the large frame house and left the key with Mr. Chard, who has agreed to look after 
the buildings in return for the use of the log schoolhouse. Also posted notices on 
the doors of the several buildings, warning against trespassing. The sailors attempted 
to procure some moss, but in the immediate vicinity of the station, where it had 
been closely pastured, there was none large enough to gather. 
August 15: At 6 a.m. hove anchor and steamed across the bay to Cape Riley, 
where we dropped anchor at 7.20 a. m, At once went ashore and commenced 
preparations to take on board 40 sled deer to be removed to Cape York for Mr. 
William T. Lopp. On July 14, 83 deer had been landed to be driven across to 
Charley, at Point Rodney, in charge of Per Larsen Anti, Tautook, and two other 
Eskimos.

INTRODUCTION OF REINDEER INTO ALASKA. 1429 
By 6 o’clock p. m. 40 deer had been caught and placed on board ship. One was 
killed on shore in handling. The deer are large, heavy, and in excellent condition. 
The two umniaks that had been hired were paid for, and at 7.15 p. m. anchor was 
hove and we steamed away for Cape York and Cape Prince of Wales. The cloud 
effect-at sunset was remarkably brilliant and beautiful. 
August 16: Dropped anchor under the lee of Cape Prince of Walesat 4 a.m. The 
wind was blowing a gale and a driving cold rain storm in progress. No communica- 
tion with shore or landing of deer possible to-day. 
August 17: At 8.50 a. m. hove anchor and steamed to Mr. Lopp’s herding grounds 
near Cape York, where we dropped anchor at 10.10 a. m. At once went ashore, 
where I found Mr. Hank Summers, mining expert. Sent to have the herd driven 
down to the beach. Also had gathered a few sacks of reindeer moss. The herd 
arriving about 10 a. m., we at once went off to the ship and commenced landing the 
deer. I remained on shore until the deer were all landed (8 p. m.). Good weather 
until midnight. 
August 18: At 9.20 hove anchor and steamed to Cape Prince of Wales, where we 
anchored at 11.25 a.m. Mr. Lopp and some natives came aboard. Reindeer barter 
goods for the use of the Bear were landed. Reindeer matters and other business 
was finished up with Mr. Lopp, and at 3.50 p. m. we were under way. 
August 19: At 5.45 a. m. dropped anchor off Cape Riley, and I went ashore to 
make arrangements for shipping reindeer. Hired three native skin boats and all the 
men I could procure. A number of the women and children were employed in 
gathering moss for the deer. During the day 36 sled deer, 3 bucks, and 10 female 
deer were taken on board, making 49 in all. Fine day. At 5.30 p. m. finished 
loading. Took on board Per Larsen Anti, together with Government dogs and sleds 
for Eaton Reindeer Station. 
August 20: At 4.05 a. m. hove anchor and steamed away for Point Rodney. Beau- 
tiful forenoon; afternoon rainy. At 5.25 p.m. anchored off Charley’s (Antisarlook’s) 
place. 
August 21: Last evening Lieutenant Hamlet was sent to the shore, but could not 
make a landing on account of the surf. Waited all day anxiously for the wind to 
change and the swell to go down, so that we could land the deer, as we were without 
food for them. In the evening moved inshore. 
August 22: Vinding no landing, this morning we hove anchor and started for 
Golovin Bay. The day proved a beautiful one, with sunshine and a crisp, invigor- 
ating north wind, but still there was no landing on the beach. Anchored at 8.40 
p.m. in the mouth of Golovin Bay under the lee of the west shore. 
August 23: At 4a. m. went ashore with Lieutenant Hamlet to hire native boats. 
It was a long pull of several miles. Secured at the village 4 umniaks. Took break- 
fast and found some late papers at the Swedish Mission. Returned to the ship about 
10 o’clock. After giving the natives some coffee and crackers the work of unloading 
the deer was commenced. Per Larsen Anti was set ashore in charge of the deer. 
Word had been sent to the Golovin Bay herd and Owikkon (native herder) came 
down to help Anti. By 3.45 p. m. the deer were unloaded, and at 7.05 we were 
under way for Anvil City. : 
August 24: At 7.30 a. m. dropped anchor off Nome. Immediately after breakfast 
went ashore and remained all day. Sent word to Mr. William A. Kjellmann and 
Mr. D. Johnson Elliott that I wished them to come down from the mines to see me. 
Met Judge Johnson, of the United States district court of Alaska, and was present 
at the opening’of the first court at Anvil City. Saw some of the citizens with regard 
to a block of ground for school purposes. Had several conferences with the Lapps 
in thesettlement of theiraccounts. Governor Brady having returned from the mines, 
invited him to go to Unalaklik with us. Hove anchor at 8.55 p. m.     
 
-P-A-G-E-190
1430 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
August 25: At 4.10 p. m. dropped anchor off Unalaklik. The steam launch took 
Governor Brady, Messrs. Kjellmann, Karlsen, and myself ashore. Had some diffi- 
culty in getting over the bar at the mouth of the Unalaklik River. Providentially 
Dr. P. H. J. Lerrigo and a party of Lapps were down the river with the reindeer 
station boat. At 10 p.m. Mrs. Karlsen kindly gave us a lunch and soon after Mr. 
Kjellmann and I, with the Lapps, started for the station ina rowboat. Mr. Lerrigo’s 
supplies and baggage were sent off to the ship by the steam launch. Bright moon- 
light, crisp and cold. Mr. Kjellmann and I laid some blankets in the bottom of the 
boat and got some sleep on our way to the station. 
August 26: The current was so swift in the river that wherever the banks would 
allow it the Lapps landed and towed the boat. It was nearly 4 o’clock in the morn- 
ing before we reached the station. Throwing myself on a bed, I slept until 6.30, 
when we had breakfast, and at 7a. m. were hard at work with the accounts and 
other business of the station. At 12.30 noon we started on our return trip to Una- 
laklik, Dr. Gambell accompanying us. It rained hard allthe way. Reached Unalak- 
lik about 4 p. m. and a flag was set as a signal for the launch. Inspected the new 
Government warehouse on the south side of the river at the mouth. Instead of 
sending the launch two boats were sent off, which were between two and three 
hours reaching shore. As the crews were wet, cold, and hungry, Reverend and 
Mrs. Karlsen gave them coffee and a warm lunch. It was expected that Mrs. 
Karlsen and Miss Johnson would go out to the ship with us en route to St. Michael. 
Miss Johnson being an invalid, the doctor forbade her going out to the ship (8 or 10 
miles) in an open boat in a rain storm. Consequently Dr. Lerrigo, Mr. Kjellmann, 
and I went off to the ship in the boats, and the governor remained to come off with 
the ladies in the Jaunch. Reached the ship at 9 p. m. 
August 27: Early in the morning the launch was sent for the governor and ladies. 
After receiving them on board the launch started to return to the ship. When in 
the surf it lost its propeller and had to signal to shore for assistance. Rowboats 
went at once and towed the launch to shore. In the meantime, the wind rising, the 
ship hove anchor at 10.05 a. m. and proceeded for shelter to the lee of an island in 
the bay, where it dropped anchor at 1.15 p. m. 
August 28: Remained all day at anchorage. 
August 29: The gale having somewhat abated, at 5 a.m. we were under way for 
Unalaklik, where we dropped anchor at 8.05 a.m. Governor Brady, Mrs. Karlsen, 
Miss Johnson, and an Eskimo girl going East for an education, came off in a row- 
boat, anda ship’s boat was sent in to tow off the disabled steam launch. The boat 
and launch returning at 12.45 noon, the ship was soon under way for St. Michael, 
where we anchored at 8.05 p. m. Went ashore for mail. 
August 30: Major Ray, U. 8. A., having placed the army steam launch at my sery- 
ice for the forenoon, we had an early breakfast and went ashore. Left vouchers 
and reports at Captain Walker’s office. Adjusted business matters with the North 
American Transportation and Trading Company. Let Mr. N. V. Hendricks have 
some reindeer for carrying the mail. Had a conference with Dr. Romig, superin- 
tendent of the Moravian Mission on the Kuskokwim River, and at 11.50 a. m. 
returned tothe ship. At 12 noon we were under way for Nome: Major Ray, U.S. A., 
accompanying us to that place. 
August 31: At 6.20 a.m. dropped anchor at Nome. After an early breakfast, went 
ashore, accompanied by Lieutenant Buhner. Mr. D. J. Elliott and Dr. John John- 
son Elliott made application for $20,000 worth of reindeer for the Swedish Evangel- 
ical Union Mission Station at Golovin Bay. At 11.20 a. m. we got under way for 
Gambell, St. Lawrence Island. 
September 1: Reached Gambell at 3 p. m. Landed Dr. Lerrigo and opened the 
mission house. Steamed away for Dutch Harbor (Udakta) at 6.45 p. m. 
September 7: Reached Udakta at 10.30 a.m., having seen no land for six days,

COMMERCIAL EDUCATION IN ANTWERP. 
Consul-General Lincoln sends from Antwerp, February 25, 1899, an article taken 
from the Belgian Times and News of even date, giving an account of the higher 
commercial institute of that city, which is summarized as follows: 
The students are divided into two classes—the ‘‘regular’’ and the ‘‘free.’’ The 
former attend all the lectures with a view to obtaining a diploma at the end of two 
years, which period constitutes the prescribed course of study, except for those pre- 
paring for the Belgian consular service, for whom a third year’s course has been 
added. The ‘‘free’’ student follows only the courses of lectures which he considers 
of importance to his commercial career. 
The instruction is practical as well as theoretical. The transactions of commercial 
and counting houses are practiced, and all questions relating to the theory of exchanges 
are accurately described. The correspondence of the ‘office’? must be conducted by 
the student himself, and that, too, in French, German, and English, which languages 
are obligatory. He must also be competent to correspond in one other foreign lan- 
guage, the choice generally being from.the Spanish, Italian, or Dutch. The Russian 
language is also taught; its study is not obligatory. The principles of political econ- 
omy, of international commercial Jaw, and of customs legislation are also inculcated. 
The geographical and economical condition of foreign countries are studied from 
carefully compiled data, and the relative value of raw material, from different sources 
of supply, is inquired into and noted. 
The student is also encouraged to take a close interest in the political events of the 
day, so far as these affect commercial interests; and the latest consular reports from 
all countries are placed at his disposal, so that he himself later on may be in a posi- 
tion to make a report upon the commercial prospects of any country in which he may 
happen to be. 
Another important feature of the Antwerp institute is the bestowal of traveling 
scholarships on the most deserving students of Belgian nationality. A sum of nearly 
£2,000 per annum is devoted to this object. A student, who has passed his final 
examination with credit, is entitled to offer himself as a candidate for one of these 
scholarships or ‘bourses,’ as they are called: If one be granted, he proceeds 
1433 
     
-P-A-G-E-194
  1434 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
abroad, with the certainty of enjoying, for three years at least, an annual income 
of about £200. He is thus relieved of the necessity of accepting the first situation 
that is offered to him and can deyote the whole of his time, if necessary, to the study 
of the economic condition of the country in which he resides. He must periodi- 
cally send home a detailed report of the result of his observations. By his previous 
training he is enabled to do this effectively; and these reports, after being noted by 
the Government, are utilized by the students in the prosecution of their studies. 
Down to the end of 1892, 62 students had been thus sent abroad, the countries 
chosen for residence being Algeria, Morocco, the Cape, Japan, China, India, Canada, 
the United States, the Argentine Republic, Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, Chile, Mex- 
ico, Cuba, Philippine Islands, Australia, and New Zealand—in fact, those countries 
in which Belgium is seeking to place her manufactures. Of these 62 students, 27 
have remained in the countries to which they proceeded and are now doing well as 
merchants or commercial agents; 16 are established in European countries, also as 
merchants; and two have entered the service of the Japanese Government as teachers 
of the commercial sciences. 
It will now probably be asked what is the cost to parents of a higher commercial 
education, such as that given at the institute at Antwerp. It is very small, the 
expenses of maintaining the establishment being borne by the Belgian Government 
in part and the rest by the Antwerp municipality. Each student pays a fee of about 
£10 the first year and £12 the second, the total amount thus raised being given as 
honorarium to the professors to supplement their salaries. 
The Government does its best to procure a really competent teaching staff, and 
pays so much.a year to each ‘‘chair,’’ giving a pension to the professors after a cer- 
tain number of years’ service. 
STUDY OF COMMERCE IN FRANCE. 
Consul Skinner writes from Marseilles, March 24, 1899: 
The commercial organizations of France are doing all within their power to pro- 
mote the study of foreign commerce and foreign languages and to overcome the 
national habit of indifference to the latter. To this end the Society for the Protection 
of Commerce in Marseilles maintains a free commercial school, and the National 
Ministry of Commerce grants ‘‘purses for residence in foreign lands.’”’ Purses of the 
first category (4,000 francs = $772 for the first year, 3,000 francs = $579 for the second), 
are reserved for young men of not less than 16 and not more than 18 years who 
desire to establish themselves in some country outside of Europe and who, by virtue 
of the law of July 15, 1889, are relieved of the obligation of active military service if 
they reside regularly in foreign parts until they shall have attained 30 years. The 
purses of the second category (varying from 2,500 to 4,000 francs, or $482 to $772) 
are for young men aged not more than 26 years, graduates of a highschool of commerce, 
who, after having accomplished their military service, are desirous of completing, 
by a practical apprenticeship, their theoretical knowledge gained at the school. 
This year two purses are to be granted for each category. 
THE VIENNA EXPORT ACADEMY. 
A consular report from Vienna on the export academy in that city gives a minute 
description of the efforts of Austrian merchants, combined with those of the Govern- 
ment, in increasing the exports of the Austrian Empire. The report is here given 
in full: 
Since the Ist of October, 1898, there has existed in Vienna a commercial school of 
an entirely original organization. This is primarily shown from the fact that the 
   
-P-A-G-E-195
THE VIENNA EXPORT ACADEMY. 1435 
institution is directed by a high official of the Austrian ministry of commerce. This 
direction is not merely nominal, but is evidenced, apart from daily influence on the 
life of the pupils, by weekly conferences under the chairmanship of the director 
himself, which have the purpose of receiving from each of the teachers a report of 
the studies of the past week and those to be taken up in the coming one. Every 
topic, even in its smallest details, is in direct relation to the object of the institution, 
This object is the promotion of the Austrian export trade. It is not designed that 
the young men, immediately after finishing their studies, should become Austrian 
exporters. On the contrary—and this is the second original phase of the scheme—it 
is desired that the graduates, on leaving the academy, act as clerks in exporting and 
manufacturing firms, there to learn the practice of some special branch of business, 
whereupon, under further support of the ministry of commerce, the graduates are to 
be placed with larger foreign firms; and finally, by the joint aid of the Austrian 
Government, the chambers of commerce, and the particular foreign consulate con- 
cerned, they will be aided to establish themselves abroad. 
One hears constantly the complaint of Austrian exporters of the sad lack of national 
commercial representation abroad. It is much more difficult for an Austrian 
exporter to find in India, China, or South America a market or bank for Austrian 
wares or drafts than it is for the German merchant, who is naturally preferred by the 
German firms in foreign countries. Austrian merchants are rarely to be found, even 
in the most important cities of other lands. This state of things it is now proposed 
toremedy by educating ambitious and gifted young men in all branches necessary for 
the future exporter to know, and inducing them to adopt such career by the certain 
prospect of aid from the Austrian Government. 
The academy has a preparatory course of one year and a regular course of two 
years. Furthef, there are special courses of greater or less duration. The tuition 
fee is 150 florins ($60) a year. The pupils will, besides, be given opportunity to 
visit occasionally, under the supervision of thoroughly informed teachers as guides, 
the prominent industrial establishments of all typical export articles, as well as cer- 
tain commercial cities and ports of special importance. Thus, for instance, an excur- 
sion to Hamburg is now planned, while trips to mills, sugar refineries, breweries, 
and furniture factories have already been undertaken. 
The Imperial Royal Commercial Museum, of which the export academy has been 
made an integral part, has put at the disposition of the academy its library, its yalu- 
able trade collections, and the requisite geographical maps and apparatus. The 
academy has a yearly subyention from the ministry of commerce of 20,000 florins 
($8,000), and a like sum is being raised by popular subscription. 
First of all, graduates of the higher commercial schools are entered as regular stu- 
dents in the academy. Further, pupils are admitted who have passed the grammar 
schools and possess such knowledge of commercial branches and of the French and 
English languages as can be acquired in a commercial school of two classes. 
All desiring to be admitted as regular students must pass a preliminary examina- 
tion. In exceptional cases pupils who have completed their studies in an unusually 
excellent manner in a commercial school, and can show testimony of already haying 
done praiseworthy work of a practical kind, may be admitted as regular students by 
the faculty, without preliminary examination. This rule of exception has already 
been applied in many instances, and gives the academy some of its most promising 
pupils. Two groups of students can be plainly distinguished—those with and those 
without practical experience. The academy would perhaps attain its highest plane 
if only students who have had practical experience were admitted. 
In no class of the academy are more than thirty students admitted, and only 
twenty in the preparatory course. The actual number of pupils at present is near 
the maximum allowed. 
Attendance at the classes and lectures of the export academy is compulsory and.   
 
-P-A-G-E-196
  14386 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
subject to strict supervision. An absence of eight days without proper justification 
is followed by striking off the student’s name from the roll. This is another dis- 
tinguishing feature of the school, wherein it differs from all other Austrian and Ger- 
man high schools and recalls the Paris Ecole des Hautes Etudes, as well as French 
schools in general. 
At Christmas and Easter during every year oral examinations are held in all the 
branches of study. During the first year the annual examination takes place in the 
first half of July. 
By reason of a special order of examination the regular students have to undergo 
a severe final examination at the close of the second year, before a board of exami- 
ners presided over by a representative of the ministry of commerce. The names of 
students who do not pass one oral examination without good excuse are stricken 
from the rolls. In some cases, the board of examiners may permit the repetition of 
a year’s course, or of the severe final examination. 
Only those students are admitted to the second year who haye favorably passed 
the annual examination in all branches of the first year’s course. 
There are thirty-four hours weekly in the preparatory course, and in the first year 
thirty-four or thirty-five obligatory hours every week, besides some that are not 
obligatory. The preparatory course has for its purpose to advance graduates of 
gymnasia and other high schools about as far in one year as an ordinary commercial 
school does the undergraduate in two or three years. 
Of the two yearly courses of the academy only the first has so far been opened, 
and the students have in all the examinations up to now given brilliant evidence of 
the excellent curriculum. In this course great stress is laid on the study of the 
French and English languages, with practice in correspondence (six hours each 
weekly). Four hours a week are devoted to domestic and foreign taw, so far as it 
concerns commerce. Three hours are given to practical exercises in the office work 
of export, import, and factory businesses. Instruction in this important branch is 
intrusted to the vice-director of the academy. The limited time given to this work 
is only the natural consequence of the fact that all students must be familiar with the 
principles of office work before their admission. 
In view of the burden entailed by the large number of school hours home time 
is demanded only for languages and office lessons. Instruction in economics, with 
special regard to tarif’s, in the usages of export trade, in commercial geography, and 
in knowledge of the world’s wares according to kind and production, is imparted in 
so-called seminaries—that is, institutions which afford immediate practice of what 
has been learned from the teacher’s lecture, and, as far as possible, actual inspection 
of the modes cf production and of samples. This experiment of giving the pupil 
the most important facts right in the school, instead of letting him learn by heart 
what he is sure to forget speedily, and of having him practice it on the spot until 
indelibly engraved on his memory, is one of the most daring as well as important 
innoyations in the field of pedagogics, and deserves to be propagated. 
Besides all this, lectures on selected subjects of actual interest are given by the 
professors of the export academy, by manufacturers in the various industries, and 
by ministerial officials, and are attended voluntarily by the students, who display 
deep interest in them. In this manner they become acquainted with special ques- 
tions of the day that are engrossing public interest, in a manner that is unbiased by 
party standpoints. 
I had the pleasure of observing the practical working of this feature of the acad- 
emy in a lecture which was a comprehensive description of the world’s commercial 
institutions devoted to the export trade. The lecturer spoke, in particular, with 
great admiration and thorough knowledge of the Philadelphia Commercial Museum 
and the National Association of Manufacturers, as well as of our other export asso- 
ciations. About the lecture room was displayed printed matter bearing on the

subject. In the American exhibit I noticed a copy of the tariff, consular invoice 
certificates, consular reports, the newly issued American Trade Index of the National 
Association, a copy of American Trade, and a number of other publications. 
This export academy should be of special interest for us in the United States. 
The addition of a similar school to the excellent means for information at the com- 
mand of the Commercial Museum in Philadelphia might cause young men to be of 
great use in our export trade and achieve even better results than the academy here, 
which is proving so practical a measure. Such a school would be of untold benefit 
to our national commerce if attended for a year by men about to enter our consular 
service. It would be an ideal consular training academy...

“ THE STUDY OF TROPICAL DISEASES IN GREAT BRITAIN. 
A consular report from Liverpool on this subject may be of more than passing 
interest. The report is here reproduced in full: 
A movement has recently been started in England for the special study of tropical 
diseases, and, now that it has developed into concrete form, there is an endeavor to 
give it an international character. The originator of this humane project is the Hon. 
Joseph Chamberlain, the British colonial secretary. The advancement of commerce 
with tropical regions, particularly Africa, has brought civilization face to face with 
diseases peculiar to those countries, which science has so far not been able to success- 
fully combat, first, because of lack of exact knowledge as to their nature and, second, 
because of the inadequacy of the remedial agencies employed. These diseases are of 
a malarial type, but it has been found that they differ somewhat from those known as 
belonging to that class in Europe and in North America, although to a certain extent 
they are similar to the malarial diseases existing in the swampy districts in seyeral 
of the Southern States. 
There are now two organizations in England that haye taken up the work of the 
study of tropical diseases, one at London and one at Liverpool. The Colonial Nurs- 
ing Association, of London, has also identified itself with the movement. The 
organization at Liverpool is independent of governmental control and has not as yet 
received any financial aid from the Government, while that at London is, to a certain 
extent, under Government auspices. The Liverpool school was started by the head 
of a large shipping firm, and the project has received the enthusiastic support of the 
local business community and medical profession, Both the London and Liverpool 
institutions are working together harmoniously for the same end, and it is confidently 
expected that the Liverpool enterprise will be given Government support. It is 
claimed that no other city offers such facilities as Liverpool does for the study of 
tropical diseases, largely because of the fact that, owing to its enormous traffic with 
the Tropics, there are more cases of these diseases here than in any other European 
city. Last year there were in one of the Liverpool hospitals (the Royal Southern) 
nearly three hundred cases of malaria, and quite a number of cases of beriberi, trop- 
ical anzemia, yellow fever, scurvy, etc. All these cases were brought to Liverpool by 
ships trading with tropical countries. 
The Liverpool School of Tropical Diseases is in connection with University College 
and the Royal Southern Hospital. Students must be qualified medical men of this 
or foreign countries, or fifth-year students. In other circumstances, special applica- 
tion must be made. A separate ward has been set apart at the hospital for the 
treatment of tropical diseases, and there is a ward laboratory for the immediate 
examination of blood and excreta. At the University College there are the Thomp- 
son-Yates laboratories, opened by Lord Lister last October, and probably the most

complete in the United Kingdom, where ample facilities will be given for the special 
scientific study of the subject. 
The managers of the Liverpool school urge that their work is not a local one, nor 
even limited to the British Empire in its beneficent scope. They plead that all 
countries haying commerce in tropical countries should interest themselves in the 
work, as, quite apart from humanitarian considerations, tropical diseases are one of 
the greatest barriers at present to the extension of commerce in the countries where 
they prevail. A short time ago letters were received from Professor Koch, of Berlin, 
heartily indorsing the undertaking, and stating that Germany was about to found a 
similar institution. The matter has been officially brought before the foreign consuls 
in Liverpool, and they, after several conferences, expressed their appreciation of the 
great value of the movement, and the suggestion’ was made that each consul should, 
in such manner as might be deemed best, bring it to the attention of his government 
and of the medical profession and others in his own country. 
Pecuniary aid from foreign governments will not be solicited, but would be grate- 
fully received. The Liverpool school would be pleased to exchange information and 
the results of scientific observation upon all phases of the subject with any foreign 
government, or any foreign medical society or hospital, or with any individual tray- 
eler or professional man, and foreign students would be cordially welcomed. Those 
interested are invited to communicate with Professor Boyce, University College, 
Liverpool. The international feature of the Liverpool School of Tropical Diseases 
has already received recognition from America. Several months ago Bishop Hart- 
zell, of the Methodist Episcopal Church of the United States, passed through Liver- 
pool en route to his field of labor, which embraces the whole of Africa. While here 
be became greatly interested in the Liverpool School of Tropical Diseases, and 
arranged that one of his medical ‘missionaries who was shortly to follow him should 
study for three months at the school. Several consuls representing maritime nations 
say that they will advise either direct support to the Liverpool school or cooperative 
action, for the reason that many victims of tropical diseases that have come under 
their observation at Liverpool have been sailors of their own nationality. 
It is the expectation that the Liverpool institution will become the recognized 
school for the training of Government medical officers proceeding to the west coast 
of Africa. A special sphere of activity will be the organization of expeditions to 
Africa to study tropical diseases, and I am officially advised that students from 
American medical colleges are invited to accompany these expeditions. Professor 
Christophers is now conducting an expedition in Africa with this object. He is 
working under the auspices of the British Government, and was specially selected 
for that purpose by the Royal Society on request of Mr. Chamberlain. He is operat- 
ing in cooperation with both the Liverpool and London schools. 
It is suggested here that in view of the new responsibilities and opportunities in 
the West Indies and the East, this enterprise should meet with sympathetic interest 
in the United States.

THE EDUCATION OF GERMAN CONSULS. 
No attentive reader of current newspaper discussion in Germany can have failed 
to notice the earnestnéss and intelligence with which the leading journals have 
seconded the plans which are now understood to be under consideration by the 
Imperial Government for the reorganization of its consular service. 
The scope and purpose of the proposed reform haye been dictated by the new and 
enlarged functions which are imposed upon the foreign service of Germany, by the
-P-A-G-E-199
  
THE EDUCATION OF GERMAN CONSULS. 1439 
expansion of her foreign trade and by the valiant fight which this country is pre- 
paring to make for a leading and permanent place in all important foreign markets. 
As long as Germany was an agricultural State, without colonies or any large export 
trade, except in manufactured products which went mainly to the United States and 
neighboring countries in Europe, her consular service, organized on the old lines, 
served satisfactorily for the protection of German subjects residing abroad and such 
other incidental duties as might be required of it. . Under that system consuls were 
educated as lawyers and diplomats, passed the prescribed assessor’s examination, 
underwent a period of training in the foreign office, and became typical Prussian 
officials, with a good command of languages, a fair knowledge of diplomacy, inter- 
national law, and the history of treaties, but no practical acquaintance with industrial 
processes, commercial values, or mercantile usages. As trained officials belonging to 
the privileged class, many of the imperial consuls and their subordinates—as is now 
asserted by the German press—have evinced a certain contempt for trade and those 
engaged in it, and have rejected requests for commercial aid and information as 
forming no part of their official duties. 
The exigencies of the wholly new situation that has been developed during the 
past ten years—stimulated, as is broadly hinted, by the recognized efficiency of 
American and other consuls in obtaining valuable information and promoting 
export trade—have created a demand for a radical reform of the entire consular 
system and its reorganization upon wholly different lines. 
In so far as the leading newspapers are informed, the propositions now under 
consideration are two: 
First. To retain practically the present consular organization and to strengthen 
the commercial efficiency of the consulates by assigning to them commercial attachés, 
a plan that has been found to work well in the German consulates in the United 
States. 
Second. To abolish permanent consuls (Berufsconsuln) and appoint in their stead 
experienced and capable merchants, who will give to the consular office a definite 
commercial character, while its legal and purely official duties are performed by 
young attachés trained in the usual manner. 
Whichever of the plans may be adopted, there is a general demand that the con- 
sular service shall remain, as now, a life career; that the basis of its personnel shall 
be a corps of consular pupils, selected by competitive examination for their intelli- 
gence, energy, and efficiency as students of modern languages, commercial law, and 
technology, trained by special studies for their career, and then sent out to foreign 
parts to begin their life work as apprentices. For the purposes of this service, the 
world will be divided into four or five districts, for each of which the consular pupil 
will be specially educated in all that relates to languages, history, and special com- 
mercial conditions. In such a division, Great Britain and its English-speaking colo- 
nies would constitute one district, the United States a second, South America a 
third, China and Japan a fourth, the East Indies a fifth; and the consular pupil, pre- 
pared and assigned to one of these, would remain there during his career, thus say- 
ing the reckless waste of valuable knowledge and experience that occurs where a 
competent consular officer, familiar with the language and commercial uses of one 
foreign country, is suddenly transferred to another. 
To emphasize the need of a radical reform on this point—in respect to which the 
proposed new German system would be a step beyond what has been hitherto 
embodied in the consular service of any other government—the Cologne Gazette says: 
The essential condition to the practical success of this reform will be a radical 
change in the plan by which our consuls are assigned to duty. Hitherto, the whole 
world has constituted for our foreign service but one district. A consular officer 
now begins his career at Pekin and during his two or three years’ service there 
learns the language and begins to feel at home. Just as he becomes of real value to 
the consulate che experience and attainments are wasted by. a transfer to Buenos  
-P-A-G-E-200
  1440 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
Ayres. What he learned in China is now lost and worthless. But he begins zeal- 
ously the study of Argentine conditions and the Spanish language. At the end of 
three years he is so far advanced that he has practical command of his district, when 
he is transferred to the consulate at Odessa. There he has to forget his Spanish just 
as he forgot his knowledge of Chinese at Buenos Ayres. He now works three years 
more to learn the language and commercial conditions of Russia, when he is pro- 
moted to consul-general and transferred to, say, Palermo. Chinese, Spanish, Russian, 
and all the peculiarities of those countries which he had laboriously acquired, and 
which would have been so valuable at either of his former posts of duty, are now 
Jost and worthless capital, and he is naturally too discouraged and indifferent to 
begin the study of Italian and the peculiar conditions in that country, because he 
knows that sooner or later he will be transferred—perhaps to Chicago—where his 
Italian would again become useless. 
This is, of course, an extreme picture, but it shows what has been a serious weak- 
ness in the bureaucratic system of consular administration, and shows how fully the 
German press at least realizes what governments have been so slow to learn, viz, 
that the higher, more valuable work of a consul requires special attainments and 
capabilities, not only in different countries, but often in different districts of the 
same country; that given intelligence, industry, and patriotic devotion to duty, the 
practical value of a consul to his country and people increases with each year that 
he remains at a given post for which he has been prepared by proper antecedent 
education; that the system of transfers with each advancement in grade or fixed 
period of service is only less wasteful and ill-considered than the plan of filling 
important consulates with wholly inexperienced men who are in danger of removal 
before they have become competent through experience and practically acquired 
knowledge of their duties. 
Whatever else may happen, this much may be recognized and taken into future 
account: Germany has set herself to the task of remaining what she has become—one 
of the foremost manufacturing and exporting nations of the world. What she lacks 
in native materials and resources she will make up for by superior education, organ- 
ization, energy, and mastery of details; and in the furtherance of this policy every 
energy of the Government and the people, from Emperor to operative, will be enlisted 
and exerted with a persistent, unswerving, patriotic purpose. 
The consular service is to be made, like the great subsidized steamship lines, the 
effective agent of the Government for pushing the trade of German merchants into 
every corner of the civilized world; and it will be reorganized, trained, and equipped 
for its work with the same scientific thoroughness that characterizes the military, 
industrial, and educational systems of this country. 
If present indications are fulfilled, the officialism which has heretofore restricted 
the usefulness of the German consular service will be sacrificed to practical utility. 
Young men, carefully selected and specially educated for service in a designated 
field, will go out and pass from clerk through the successive grades to consul-general 
in that one district, and as the final reward of competent, faithful service, will be 
recalled for duty in the foreign office, which will in time become a bureau of 
experts, whose aggregate knowledge will cover the whole realm of German export 
trade. 3 
As has already happened in law, medicine, engineering—in nearly every field of 
applied science—the day of the all-round man, with a smattering of many things 
put a thorough knowledge of nothing, is definitely past, and the successes of the 
future will be won by the nations as well as by the individuals who can bring the 
highest attainments, the largest experience, artd the most consummate proficiency 
to bear where competition is keenest and the richest prizes are to be won.

this chapter. (See pp. 1443-46.) 
CARE OF CHILDREN IN GERMAN SCHOOLS. 
Commercial Agent Stern writes from Bamberg, January 7, 1899: 
A resolution which is well worthy of being imitated, and which ought to be widely 
circulated in the American press, has just been passed by the city council of Wiirz- 
burg, Bavaria, the seat of a university. According to this resolution, the teeth of the 
poor pupils of the public schools of that city are to be examined and cared for free of 
cost, provided that the parents give their consent. It is intended to treat diseases of 
the ear and throat in like manner, should the first experiment prove successful. 
EMBROIDERY SCHOOL AT PLAUEN, GERMANY. 
Consul Monaghan, of Chemnitz, under date of April 15, 1899, reports that a school 
for teaching embroidery is about to be opened in Plauen. The Government has 
appropriated 9,000 marks ($2,142) and the city 3,000 marks ($714) for the initial 
expenses; ‘5,000 marks ($1,190) and 3,000 marks ($714), respectively, will be contrib- 
uted annually for its maintenance. The number of applicants for admission is said 
to be so large that hardly half can be accommodated. Consul Monaghan speaks of 
the excellent system of technical education in Germany; nearly every important 
branch of industry in the Empire, he says, has its school, and the country’s indus- 
trial development is in large measure due to these educational facilities.

GERMAN SCHOOLS IN FOREIGN PARTS. 
Ccnsul Monaghan sends the following from Chemnitz, June 3, 1899: 
It may not be generally known that Germany maintains schools in foreign coun- 
tries. A fund is yearly voted by the Reichstag for this purpose. There is now an 
agitation in favor of granting the schools the right to award exemption from the long 
periods of military service; in other words, to grant the one-year service diplomas. It 
is argued that when young men in foreign parts, born of German parents, can pass 
examinations and earn the right to serve in the army only one year they will have 
greater inducement to retain their German citizenship. It is pointed out that boys 
born abroad, deprived of this right, go into other armies, and necessarily assume citi- 
zenship of the state under whose flag they stand. These facts have had great weight 
with the Government. The efforts of this people in foreign countries not only in 
selling the products of its industry, but in propagating its language and maintaining 
its hold on its offspring, are untiring. 
INDUSTRIAL SCHOOLS IN SAXONY. 
Unirep Srares Consunare, 
Chemnitz, Saxony, Germany, June 22, 1899. 
The commendable efforts now being made among the educational elements of the 
United States to develop the industrial, industrial art, and technical education of our 
people are equaled by renewed efforts among the educators and manufacturers of 
this Empire. June 1 and 2 ameeting was held in Kisenach to consider the question of 
how best to improve commercial education. The meeting was made up of members 
of the German Union for the Encouragement of Commercial Education.- Twenty- 
one of its members had been at the last International Educational Congress. They 
were very much pleased with its work, so much so that a vote was passed to send 
delegates to the next one, to be held next year in Paris. It was voted further to 
prepare comparative reports on industrial education in different countries and to 
present them at the congress in Paris. The union is interested in the preparation of 
a book dealing with this Empire’s industrial conditions, history. progress, and pros- 
pects. Some very able writers are employed on the work. It will be exhaustive 
and exact. A book is to be out this year dealing with the commercial schools of all 
countries. The union voted also to join the general or imperial union for the 
encouragement of mercantile and industrial education now forming. 
A proposition to still further encourage the so-called Fortbildungsschulen, or sup- 
plementary elementary schools, was unanimously adopted. A memorial setting 
forth how best to establish, fit up, and conduct such schools is to be laid before a 
school congress that meets this year in Hanover. This congress will discuss the fol- 
lowing questions: (1) What fundamentals are necessary for the establishment of 
mercantile schools? (2) Why should the network of commercial schools be extended, 
and how shall it be done? (3) How can the apparently contradictory elements now 
opposing a satisfactory general and technical development of young merchants in 
commercial matters be equalized or neutralized? (4) How are the pensions and 
appointment of commercial school teachers to be regulated? 
This is interesting and important. It goes to show how eager, how earnest, these 
people are in all that pertains to education. They are following Bismarck’s advice, 
to ‘‘keep ahead.”

J. C. MonaaHan, Consul.

HIGH-ART REPRODUCTIONS FOR AMERICA. 
Consul-General Mason, of Berlin, under date-of September 1, 1899, sends.a report 
giving a description of an association organized in Berlin some years.ago for the pur- 
pose of applying a new process of colored photograyure to the reproduction of the 
masterpieces in the royal galleriesof Europe. The educational character of the work, 
Mr. Mason thinks, makes it worthy of notice. The report reads: 
It will doubtless interest the friends of zsthetic culture in America to know that 
a society in Berlin known.as the ‘‘ Vereinigung der Kunstfreunde fiir die amtlichen 
Publicationen der Kéniglichen National Gallerie’? (Union of Friends of Art for the 
Official Publication of the Royal National Galleries), which is organized under a char- 
ter issued by the Prussian ministry of worship and-education, is about to send a dele- 
gate to our country for ‘the purpose of establishing a branch office in the United 
States. As its name implies, the society is the vehicle for distributing among the 
educational and religious institutions of Germany, and the people in general, facsimile 
copies in colors of the great masterpieces and famous paintings in the royal galleries 
in Kurope, thus planting the seeds of art education in the minds of the rising genera- 
tion and fostering among the intelligent classes a cultivated taste for wholesome art. 
As particular stress has been laid by the most eminent authorities in American art 
education upon the fact that, much as our own art culture has improved within the 
last twenty years, the improvement in refined esthetic taste has not kept pace with 
it, unless in exceptional individuals, and that it has been of necessity limited more 
or less to the wealthier classes, the establishment of a branch of the Art Patrons’ 
Society of the Royal National Galleries in the United States seems to deserve the 
earnest attention of our art educators at home.

HIGH ART REPRODUCTIONS FOR AMERICA. 1447 
The popularity which the society enjoys here and the suecess which has crowned 
its efforts must be accredited to the artistic standard of its productions, which rise 
far above the meaningless black-and-white prints, cheap chromos, photogravures, 
ete., that flood the German art market. This superiority is due, in the main, to the 
peculiar process owned and employed by the society in its reproductions, a process 
which, in due course, it intends to transplant to the United States. It differs in its 
method from any heretofore employed, inasmuch as it enables the reproducing art- 
ists not only to create true facsimiles of the original in every outline, by means of 
photography and steel etching, but also to produce the depth of coloring and the 
peculiarities of manner of each master by a special employment of the colors called 
heliotint, thus reproducing the characteristic handiwork of the artists. 
The process, although an intricate and costly one, has not been patented; but 
strict secrecy is kept as to the manipulations of the plates in some of the stages 
through which they have to pass. After the original paintings have been photo- 
graphed, for which purpose special cameras haye been built and negative plates of 
particular sensitiveness are prepared, the photographic productions are transferred 
to steel plates, the surfaces of which, by some peculiar treatment, have been pre- 
pared to receive the impressions from the negatives. 
The outline work is thus obtained from the steel with an exactitude and clearness 
never before known. In the meantime the colors, as true to the original painting in 
the distribution of light and shade as manipulation of the brushes of eminent artists 
can make them, have been reproduced on the photographic copy first obtained, and 
the complex ‘‘color tableau’’ thus created is transferred to as many lithographic 
stones as there are colors represented in the picture, from which impressions are 
taken on presses worked by hand, as it has been found that presses worked by 
machinery can not do the work with the minuteness and cleanliness necessary to 
effect perfect reproductions. 
The methods employed by the society for the distribution of its productions among 
the educational and religious institutions of the country and the people at large are 
somewhat unique. 
It obtained at the start a list of patrons, who, in consideration of certain annual 
contributions, caused the society to distribute a number of the works among the 
educational institutions of the country. This list of patrons gradually grew, headed 
by the Emperor and Empress of Germany, who are followed by many of the mem- 
bers of other royal and princely families in Europe, until it has reached an aggre- 
gate membership of more than 16,000. 
These patrons gradually introduced the society’s productions into the homes of 
subaltern officers, teachers, civic employees, and people in the humble walks of life, * 
who, however, before becoming entitled to the privilege of receiving such art repro- 
ductions, had to sign the society’s roll of membership and thus become active agents 
in the missionary work of spreading culture in art. 
Keeping its educational tendencies continually in mind, the society has always 
exercised the greatest care in the choice of subjects for reproduction. It has made 
selections from the great classical and modern religious painters, Rafael, Murillo, 
Guido Reni, Paolo Veronese being among the former, and Hoffmann, Plockhorst, 
Gerhardt, and others among the latter. It has also endeavored to foster the love of 
home and country by giving reproductions from famous masters which represent 
scenes from history, and it will adhere to a like policy in the conduct of its Ameri- 
can branch. Each year a number of subjects from the history of the United States, 
these subjects to be chosen by an American advisory board, will be selected for 
reproduction, the originals to be painted by American artists. (Leutze’s famous 
eanvas ‘‘ Washington crossing the Delaware”’ is already on the stocks in the society’s 
ateliers to open the American series.) ‘These American historical paintings will be 
placed on exhibition both in the United States and in Europe, and gold medals will

be awarded by the society to those American artists whose works are chosen for repro- 
duction. American landscapes and marine views will also be included in this line, 
and it is proposed, in time, to erect a suitable building in one of the principal cities 
of the Union, which is to serve the purposes of an artistic workshop for the Ameri- 
can branch of the society. 
HOUSEHOLD SCHOOLS IN LIEGE, BELGIUM. 
Consul Winslow sends the following from Liége, November 27, 1899: 
There are in the city of Liége ten free household schools (schools for domestic 
science), five of which were founded in 1890 and the others in 1898. Nine of these 
are evening schools, lasting two hours on four nights of each week during the school 
year. These evening schools are attended by girls from 12 to 13 years of age who 
have finished thgir elementary course in the day schools. 
One day school is attended by the girls of the sixth school year in the public 
schools, divided into groups of 24, each group attending a week at a time. Each 
group forms four divisions of 6 pupils each, who undertake the different tasks, 
such as cooking, mending, washing, etc. The authorities intend to open three more 
day schools during the school year 1899-1900. There is talk of connecting a house- 
hold school with each elementary school. 
The branches taught in these schools are cooking, washing, mending, hygiene, 
household economy, and, in fact, everything relating to housekeeping. Of late, the 
care of little children has been added. These schools are founded and maintained 
by the city, with the aid of Government, which pays from 40 to 60 per cent of the 
expense. The term lasts from the Ist of October until Easter, when the pupil gets 
a diploma. From Easter to the last of July the courses are attended by the higher 
classes for four weeks—a week at a time, in order not to interfere with their ordinary 
studies. 
  MANUAL TRAINING IN GERMANY. 
On the 1st of October twenty-four years had elapsed since the movement haying 
for its object the manual training of boys was inaugurated in Germany. In this 
space of time the idea has certainly been disseminated largely in this Empire, and 
over 2,000 teachers have given their cooperation to the movement; nevertheless, 
both the internal and the external conditions connected with this new branch of 
tuition leave much to be desired. The original training in home industries and 
home occupation has almost entirely disappeared; it is carried on at present only ina 
few places in Holstein and in 17 institutes for the blind. Most of the other educational 
“establishments in Germany, including 18 orphanages and 46 institutes for the deaf 
and dumb, have already introduced manual training into their curriculum. But the 
endeavor to prepare the pupils in the schools direct for the eventual handicraft has 
obtained importance in only two of Germany’s institutions of learning. The majority 
of the German home-industry schools only deal pedagogically with the subject. 
There exist at present in Germany, distributed in 605 places, 861 schools and 
institutes wherein manual training is carried on in 1,514 workshops. Of this num- 
ber, 836 schools and institutes conduct the training on a pedagogical basis. Prussia 
has 570 manual-training schools, spread over 435 places and distributed among 596 
workshops. Industrial centers take the lead, as follows: Prussia, Upper Silesia, the 
Rhenish Province, and the Kingdom of Saxony. 
The 1,514 pupils’ workshops comprise 286 independent manual-training schools 
and 238 public schools, of which 16 are auxiliary schools where the work is obligatory, 
17 grammar schools, 41 high schools (made up of 8 classical schools, 12 realistic or
-P-A-G-E-209
  
  MUTUAL AID SOCIETIES IN FRENCH SCHOOLS. 1449 
modern high schools, 6 mixed high schools, and 15 boarding schools) 7 preparatory- 
| institutions, 26 normal schools, and 93 boys’ asylums, while the remainder is made 
up of various kinds of private educational establishments. The organization of the 
handicraft tuition in the individual schools and institutes is varied in character. 
Sixty-nine institutes have adopted the whole curriculum as recommended by the 
German Association for the Dissemination of Manual Skill, while 16 dispense with 
the preparatory work; of the rest, 177 schools and institutes confine themselves to 
three branches, 261 limit themselves to two, and the remainder to one branch only. 
Five hundred and thirty-five workshops are deyoted to wood carving, 527 to work- 
ing in cardboard, and 336 to the carpenter’s bench; of these, 68 are closely connected 
with wood ¢arving, 77 with preparatory roughing-out work, 35 with metal work, 28 
with country timbering, 11 with turnery, and 11 with modeling in clay. 
Pedagogical manual tuition has branched out in three directions—the practical 
formal method, which regards handicraft as a means to general culture; the direction 
adyocated by those who aim at the so-called school manual dexterity, and the sys- 
tem which would make the manual training serve as the basis of individual branches 
of teaching and utilize these in order to influence the method of instruction in 
schools. The first two are becoming more and more amalgamated. In the third 
direction, Professor Kumpa, at Darmstadt, School Inspector Scherer, at Worms, 
and Rector Briickmann, at Kénigsberg, Prussia, are at present engaged in making 
thorough experiments in public schools. 
The participation of German teachers in the efforts of the German association is 
steadily increasing. Over 2,200 German teachers have up to now been taught to 
become instructors in manual training. Of these, 950 were taught in Leipzig and 
1,250 acquired training in 33 places in other parts of Germany.

MUTUAL-AID SOCIETIES FOR FRENCH SCHOOL CHILDREN. 
A great many mutual-aid societies, called petit-cayés, from their founders, Edouard 
Petit and J. C. Cavé, are now being organized among the school children of France. 
They are established under a law of 1856, amended and made more operative by a 
law of 1898. Their object is to afford assistance to their child members during sick- 
ness and to furnish a pension fund for old age, to be drawn upon when 50, 55, or 60 
years old, according to the amount deposited or as the beneficiary may elect. The 
maximum pension is 360 francs ($69.48). 
The children deposit 10 centimes, or 2 sous (2 cents), per week, which is divided 
into two equal parts, 1 sou going to the mutuality fund for aid in sickness, the other 
to the pension fund. This money is deposited in a government depository, where , 
it is invested in government bonds and draws 3} per cent interest. 
The especial feature of these societies is the aid given them by the Government. 
For every child who contributes during an entire year the State adds 1 franc (19.3 
cents) to the common fund. It also gives a sum equal to one-fourth of the entire 
amount deposited by the children. 
The 1 sou deposited weekly which goes to the pension fund can never be recovered. 
except in the form of a pension. If the child dies before reaching the age limit, or 
for any reason drops out of the list of depositors, his sous go to the state. The 
money derived from the reserve fund passes to the next of kin in the event of the 
death of the depositor. 
Every school child is given a ‘‘livret,’’ or bank book, upon the cover of which is 
printed a brief tabulated statement of the pension rate that 1 frane will produce at 
the age of 55 if deposited in childhood. The table states that if 1 franc is deposited 
at 3 years of age the depositor may draw 74 centimes (about 14} cents of our money) 
 
-P-A-G-E-210
  1450 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99, 
annually when he is 55 years of age, and that this sum will be increased in propor- 
tion to the number of francs deposited until it reaches the limit of 360 francs ($69.48) 
annually. The table computes the interest on 1 franc deposited when from 3 to 12 
years of age, running up to 55 years, 
The 1 sou deposited as a reserve capital, which swells the mutuality fund for sick- 
ness, does not draw as high a rate of interest as the pension fund. A frane depos- 
ited at 3 years of age will yield but 12 sous (12 cents) pension at the age of 55, 
But the depositor does not part with his reserve capital. He can never possess it 
again; but if he should die before the age to receive it his next of kin can take 
the entire accumulations derived irom the 1 sou deposited weekly for the reserve 
fund, and the depositor in the meantime would receive the benefit of it during sick- 
ness. This capital is also swelled by national and sometimes communal appropria- 
tions, as well as by legacies and gifts from other sources. 
There is a trust company in Lycns and a number of other cities, ealled the Caisse 
des Dépots et Consignations, under the immediate direction of the Government, in 
which these mutual-aid funds are deposited, and by whose officers they are invested 
in government bonds and other securities approved by the state. These moneysare 
also loaned to public institutions, such as hospitals, the government pawn shop, etc. 
The aims of the children’s societies, as set forth in a circular addressed to all the 
parents of pupils, briefly stated, are; 
To aid parents by paying them an indemnity, during the sickness of their chil- 
dren, of 10 cents per day during the first, and 5 cents per day during the second and 
third months of sickness, 
To create annual pension funds from the payment of monthly dues, government 
appropriations, and donations, which can be enjoyed by all persons after a member- 
ship of fifteen years. 
To imbue all children at an early age with the elements of economy; to accustom 
them to the use of a bank book, and to the consciousness of having money at work 
earning something for them and held in reserve for their old age. 
To create and maintain a fund called ‘‘trésor de l’avenir”’ (a treasury for the 
future), the product of which will be exclusively used to provide means of industrial 
education; to assist the depositors later in life to become members of mutual-aid 
societies, and to aid them in establishing themselves in business, 
This society is very rapidly spreading throughout France, especially among the 
working classes, who look upon it as furnishing more substantial relief than the sav- 
ings banks. The latter are becoming gorged with money. The limit for any one 
depositor at present is 2,000 frances ($386); but after August, 1900, it will be reduced 
to 1,500 ($289). 
\There are other societies similar to those herein described, but they are more 
especially for men, They have recently taken a very wide extengion in France and 
“ will be the subject of a future report,

WORKINGMEN’S AID SOCIETIES IN FRANCE. 
A meeting of the presidents of the mutual-aid societies of the Rhone, recently 
held in Lyons, calls attention to a movement among the working classes of France 
in the direction of solving the labor problem. There were present a number of high 
functionaries, one minister of the Government, senators, members of the lower house 
of Parliament, judges of courts, bankers, and other prominent business men, the 
mayor of Lyons, and representatives of the local and departmental governments. 
L These societies are organized under national laws, and are partly sustained by
-P-A-G-E-211
ee en Se ee Oe 
WORKINGMEN’S AID SOCIETIES IN FRANCE. 1451 
public funds. They are under the immediate supervision of the “superior council 
of mutual-aid societies.” This council is a part of the interior department.of the 
national government, and is composed of 36 members, among whom are senators, 
members of the lower house of Parliament, officers of the financial, agricultural, 
labor, and commerce ministries, and of the Academy of Medicine. It is believed in 
France that these associations will be effective in diverting workingmen from com- 
munism:.and attaching them more closely tothe Republic, with which their interests 
are inseperably involved. 
These workingmen’s unions are the growth of over a century and are declared to 
be the final development of the scheme of liberty, equality, and fraternity an- 
nounced in 1793. Societies of workingmen abounded before the Revolution, but 
they were abolished because their chiefs used them for their own personal aggran- 
| dizement, and they became a part of the despotism against which the Revolution 
was a protest. The assembly declared that it was “‘the duty of the nation and of 
officials, in its name, to furnish work to the healthy and able-bodied, assistance to 
the infirm, and education to children.’’ To the end that despotism, civil or reli- 
gious, might find no secret conclave in which to plot, the assembly prohibited the 
organization of all societies and ‘‘all groups of workingmen of the same trade.” 
The guilds and various societies in the country at once disappeared. 
Notwithstanding the rejection of petitions pleading for the permission to organize, 
45 societies “composed of many different kinds of tradesmen’’ were reported before 
the end of the eighteenth century. In 1806 they numbered 90; in 1821, 124, and 
in 1830, 387. From 1830 to 1848, by encouragement and pecuniary assistance from | 
the Government, the number rose to 1,100. At the end of the Second Republic, in | 
1852, they numbered 4,721, with 700,600 active members and 80,000 honorary 
members. Almost stationary under the Second Empire, new life was imparted to | 
them by the advent of the Third Republic. In 1880 the mutual aid societies num- 
bered 6,500, with $00,000 riembers; in 1890, 8,000, with 1,200,600; in 1898, 12,000, 
with 2,000,000 members, and to-day their membership foots up nearly 2,500,000. 
They have distributed over 700,000,000 francs ($185,100,000) to their needy members, 
have on hand over 300,000,000 francs ($57,900,000), and annually pay pensions to 
60,000 aged pensioners. 
Mr. Bleton, who presided over the meeting ‘held in ‘this city, said in his address 
that these societies “originated in a natural disposition among men to help each 
other, and were perpetuated by a profound sentiment of fraternity sustained by the 
national government.”” Employers encouraged the movement, became honorary 
members, and contributed to the treasury. Thespeaker continued: 
‘A society is the family enlarged. Women influence their husbands and their chil- 
dren to conform strictly to the regulations of the societies. Husband and wife enjoy 
equal rights in a.society, are bound by the same duties, and the dignity of the family 
is enhanced by its association with the Government, whose officers become, in a 
measure, its direct financial managers.   There are two kinds of mutual-aid societies in France—tree and approved. | 
The first has.a legal existence, is empowered to receive gifts and legacies, and is : 
under but one legal restriction, to wit, it cannot hold real estate. It-does not receive 
direct assistance from the state. 
The approved society is under government control. The Government appoints 
its president, but his name is.generally proposed by ‘the society. After a first meet- 
ing is held, a copy of the by-laws .and constitution is deposited with the prefect for 
approval and remains thereas.apart of thearchives. Any class of citizens—working- 
men, clerks, small or large shopkeepers, girls or boys—can organize a society and have 
it approved. It must be proved that its members are able to pay the monthly dues, 
to give aid in sickness, and to deposit in the Government bank. This bank is:called 
Ea Caisse des Dépots et Consignations. The money deposited is invested in govern- 
7 aa
-P-A-G-E-212
  1452 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
ment bonds—national, departmental, or communal—which never draw more than 3 
per cent interest. Sometimes the premium is so high that the interest is less than 
this figure; but the Government always appropriates enough to bring the interest up 
to 44 per cent, which is left to accumulate for the old-age pension fund. 
This pension fund has received numerous contributions, the most important being 
10,000,000 francs ($1,930,000) from the estate of the Orleans family, confiscated in 
1852. Cities, communes, and departments now and then appropriate a few hundred 
frances for a local society; employers give aid at times; legacies are bequeathed to the 
societies; and at the end of every thirty years the unclaimed deposits in the savings 
banks are turned into the general fund. 
The members of these societies may be men, women, and children from 3 years of 
age up to 50. A marked increase is noticed of late among the depositors ranging 
from 3 to 19 years of age. During the year 1898 that class represented 46.75 per 
cent of.the total depositors. There were over 1,200 depositors among the school 
children of Roubaix and Tourcoing, and they all decided to enter upon the enjoy- 
ment of their pension when they reached the age of 55. Nearly half of them were 
not over 10 yearsold. They calculated that, whatever might befall them, they could 
take care of themselves up to 55 years of age, and keep up their deposits as a provision 
for the rest of their lives. Over half the depositors elect to begin living upon their 
pensions when 55 years old. 
During 1898 what are called ‘collective accounts’’ represented the largest amount 
of deposits. These are accounts opened by large business concerns, railroad compa- 
nies, banks, ete. The Crédit Lyonnais, a bank which has branches all over France, 
made 8,185 deposits for its employees. The Northern Railroad Company deposited 
a large sum, the product of contributions from all its employees, to which the com- 
pany added an almost equal amount. The employees of the arsenals, manufactories 
of arms, foundries, and powder magazines earn about 5 francs (96 cents) per day, 
and 4 per cent of their wages is withheld every month’ and deposited as a pension 
fund. In the army, 5 per cent of the salaries of officers is withheld and deposited 
as a pension fund. 
In a small circular, which is distributed broadcast among the workingmen of 
France, is a printed statement of the amount of annual pension which a man can 
enjoy at the age of 55, 60, of 65 years by a monthly deposit of sums ranging from 1 
franc (19,3 cents) up; also, how much money must be deposited yearly to yield an 
income at 50 or 55 of 360 or 1,000 franes ($69 to $193). If a father deposits 100 francs 
($19.30) for a child 3 years old, it will form a pension at 50, ‘reserved capital,” of 
41 francs ($7.91); ‘‘alienated capital,’’ 51 francs ($9.84). At 60 years it will be 92 
and 115‘francs ($17.75 and $21.92); at 65, 153 and 190 francs ($26.82 and $36.67). 
“Reserved capital’? reverts to the heirs if the principal dies before the date for 
enjoying the pension. ‘‘Alienated capital’? goes to the general fund at the death of 
the principal. 
An economy of 2 sous (2 cents) per day, or 36 francs ($6.95) per year, for sixteen 
years, yields an income at 50, reserved capital, of 139 francs ($26.83) ; alienated capi- 
tal, 208 francs ($40.14); at 55, 210 and 219 francs ($40.53 and $42.37); at 60, 331 and 
509 francs ($63.88 and $98.28). 
According to the bulletin recently published by the Government the deposits 
made in 1898 numbered 2,284,224, amounting to 44,543,697 francs ($8,596,930). 
Ninety-one thousand six hundred and four new accounts were opened; 15,323,576 
francs ($2,957,450) were paid to the heirs of depositors in the reserve fund. The 
grand total of receipts from May 11, 1851, to December 31, 1898, is 1,612,841,576 
franes ($311,278,424). 
Deposits can be made in every village where there is a post-office or tax collector. 
No sum less than 1 franc (19.3 cents) is received; but as postage stamps are accepted, 
many people begin by a 1-cent stamp, making the deposit when the savings amount
-P-A-G-E-213
MUSIC LIBRARY IN GENEVA. 14538 
to 20 cents. Not over 500 francs ($96.50) can be deposited by one person in one 
year. The pension up to 360 francs ($69.48) can not be seized for debt. If the 
pension is the result of a gift, it can not be seized for debt, however much it may 
exceed the 360-franc ($69.48) limit. Ifa wife and husband deposit in one account 
and one of them dies, the entire pension passes to the survivor. If an aged pen- 
sioner receives but 200 or 300 francs ($38.60 or $57.90) per year, he adds to this the 
franc a day, more or less, that he can earn as porter in an apartment house. The 
average wages of the porter are 200 francs ($38.60) per year and the use of two 
rooms. As people prefer old soldiers, porters are often retired gendarmes who have 
an army pension, an old-age pension from their economies, porter’s wages, and free 
rent. The porter at the bank of the Dépots et Consignations, where all the pension 
business in Lyons is transacted, is 79 years old. He and his wife have 2,500 francs 
($482.50) per year from pensions, rent free, and they deposit in the savings bank 
every month. There are 8,000 pensioners enrolled at the bank in Lyons; but the 
number is destined to grow very rapidly now, as it*is made obligatory for employees 
of mills and factories to lay by from 1 to 2 francs (19.3 to 38.6 cents) per month, 
this sum being withheld from their wages. 
Of the monthly dues paid into the mutual-aid societies, a small sum is withheld 
for the assistance of the sick. Those who are out of work for other cause than a 
strike receive a daily allowance from their society of from 1 to 2 francs. 
The custom of making provision, by government intervention, for the support of 
the aged and infirm is a natural outgrowth of French institutions. Asa boy can not 
be drafted into the army if he is the only support of aged parents, the maintenance 
of the defense of the nation exacts that the number of the needy should be made as 
small as possible. As the Government takes possession of the boy for three years 
for army service at a time when he might be learning a trade and laying the founda- 
tion for a future livelihood, it deems it a duty to intervene in his behalf and aid him 
in providing for the day of need. 
The Government withholds a certain percentage from the salary of army officers 
against the day when they will be on the retired list. Subordinate officers—lieu- 
tenants and captains—are not allowed to get married until they show to the satis- 
faction of the war department that the wife will bring 1,200 francs ($231.60) per 
year to the household. This rule is suspended only to legitimize children. The 
salary of a marshal of France is 30,315 francs ($5,850.80) per year, but he only 
receives 28,800 francs ($5,558.40), the rest going into an old-age pension fund. Of 
the 19,894 francs ($3,839.54) which constitute the salary of a general of division, 994 
frances ($191.84) is withheld. But if a general is located in a city like Paris or Lyons 
and is the military governor thereof, an important sum is added for his household 
expenses. The process of laying up a store for old age runs through the army until 
the private soldier is reached. He receives 6 cents per day for his services, 5 cents 
of which are withheld for board and lodging, leaving him 1 cent per day for spending 
money and his bank account, which he often invests in postage stamps.

MUSIC LIBRARY IN GENEVA.? 
A rather unique enterprise of certain music dealers in Geneva may be of interest 
in the United States. 
The dealers in question keep very large stocks of all sorts of classical and popular 
music, both instrumental and vocal, to all of which access may be had by students   
1Libraries such as Consul Ridgely describes are found in all cities of Germany. They vary in 
details, but the essential features are the same as those of a circulating library of books.—Compiler,

and others for a subscription fee of from 50-cents‘a‘month‘up. In other words, 
these dealers in this particular operate their music stores on the plan ofa circulating 
library. ‘Subscribers ‘may ‘take from ‘three to'twelve pieces of music at atime, and 
may change as-often as they please. Toxstudents who desire'to have access ‘to a large 
and varied repertoire of music and who-can not afford to buy at will, this admirable 
plan comes as‘a benison, and the dealers who ‘have inaugurated it in'Geneva are 
being well repaid for their enterprise, not only by the patronage of the students, but 
by a large and general client@le. ‘The subscription fees‘are as follows: 
  
   
       Description. 1month,| ‘1 year. 
  
  3 pieces of music at a time $0. 50 $2.40 
S-pieces of music ata tim 270 3.00 8 pieces of music at a time ~90 4.00 
12 pieces of music at a time. 1.10 5.00 
  
Subscribers are held responsible for damage done to the music beyond ordinary 
wear and tear. 
I do not know whether or not an enterprise of this character exists in the United 
States. If not, it seems to me that it might be generally and advantageously put . 
into use in our larger cities. It might even be made a feature of circulating libraries.

COLONIAL SCHOOL IN FRANCE. 
Consular Agent Harris, of Eibenstock, under date.of February 12, 1900, writes: 
A colonial institute is to be opened in Marseilles to prepare young men to fill 
positions in the French colonies. Expeditions of students will be sent out at the 
expense of the State, and commercial houses will receive the information thus 
obtained in the form of detailed reports. Instruction will be given in botany, 
zoology, natural history, colonial geography, and history, etc. There will be a 
museum of plants, minerals, etc., so that the student may become acquainted with 
the actual products of the colonies; also a school of medicine to familiarize him 
with the diseases peculiar to tropical countries. It is probable that arrangements 
will be made for teaching oriental languages. For grounds and buildings the city 
of Marseilles has donated $193,000. 
COLONIAL TRAINING IN BELGIUM. 
Consul Roosevelt writes from Brussels, February 23, 1900: 
In view of the increasing prosperity in the Belgian Kongo, this Government is 
considering means of interesting the people in the subject of colonization. ‘One of 
the most practical is the recent establishment at the horticultural school, at Vil- 
vorde, of a special department for the training of students who intend to seek a for- 
tune in the colonies. There ‘will be practical demonstrations of the sort of buildings 
a settler must construct, and instruction in rules of sanitation. The cultivation of 
indigenous plants,«as well ‘as of European vegetables ‘and plants, the best methods 
of gathering crops and transporting them to market where there is a demand for 
them, and the way to treat the native population, from which ‘the labor supply must 
be- drawn, willall be dealt with.

  SCHOOL OF FIREARMS AND CABINETMAKING. 1455 
LIEGE SCHOOL OF FIREARMS 
In the city of Liége, Belgium, there is established an industrial school known as 
the ‘Ecole Professionnelle d’Armurerie, founded in 1896 by the city of Liége, the 
Government, and the province, where thorough instruction is given in the manufac- 
ture of firearms. 
The complete course covers a period of three years, and is divided into theoretical 
and practical. The theoretical-covers drawing, lectures on the strength and combi- 
nation of steeland iron, ete. The practical consjsts of several departments, such as 
woodworking, engraving, and polishing, each presided over by a competent instructor. 
Tuition is free, and besides the pupil is paid 25 centimes (5 cents) per day, and on 
completing his ‘course receives a’sum equal to 25 per cent of the sales of his finished 
work. 
This school opened with 8 pupils, and at present has 115 in the different depart- 
ments, which‘is its limit. Arrangements are about completed for materially enlarg- 
ing the buildings during the coming summer to provide accommodations for more 
than 200. 
Pupils from this school have no difficulty, I am informed, in securing positions at 
good wages for this country, which is from 4 to 6 francs (77 cents to $1.15) per day, 
while ordinary workmen receive from 2.50 to 4 frances (49’to 77 cents) per day. 
The important position occupied by the school will be realized when it is under- 
stood that about 30,000 persons in this city and immediate vicinity are employed in 
the firearms industry. The object of the institution is to qualify workmen for 
responsible positions in the different factories, since for the past few years nearly all 
are employed on piecework, which does not fit men for positions requiring a general 
knowledge of the business. This put the manufacturers‘at a great disadvantage, as 
it was becoming nearly impossible to secure competent foremen and superintendents 
of departments. 
For several centuries the manufacture of ‘firearms has been the leading industry of 
Liége and vicinity, and the city maintains an extensive museum of firearms. 
It is interesting to note that several thousand of the old flintlock guns are still 
manufactured here each year for the trade in the interior of Africa, the natives pre- 
ferring them to the modern guns.

CABINETMAKING SCHOOL AT MAGDEBURG. 
The consular reports of late years-contain a vast amount of information on the 
subject of technical and industrial schools in Europe, and they clearly show that 
Germany easily takes the lead in this line, ‘by:annually appropriating large sums of 
money for instruction in almost:every art and industry. It is generally recognized 
that commercial progress throughout this country depends largely upon the condi- 
tion of technical education. Outside of the many schools for agriculture and com- 
merece, the system of special schools for other purposes is wonderfully complete. 
‘The tailors, the painters, the shoemakers, the bakers, the smiths, the brewers, the 
butchers—each trade has its schools for theoretical and practical training. 
I recently discovered at Magdeburg a school that roused my interest to an unusual 
degree. Though somewhat familiar with educational work done in this country, 
and also with its technical schools, I had never yet seen such an institution. It 
seemed admirable, so much so that I deem it my duty to call attention to it, as it 
may interest others. There is no imposing architecture of any kind; no lecture halis, 
no chapel, no museum, no gymnasium, no campus; there are only half a dozen 
rooms on the'top floor of a four-story building in a narrow side street. It has no  
-P-A-G-E-216

faculty of brilliant scholars, but only a few devoted men. There isno liberal endow- 
ment by millionaire philanthropists, but a scant support from the Government, 
hardly sufficient, I was told, to keep body and soul of the institution together. 
The school was founded by a Mr. Kiethaber, a citizen of Magdeburg, a plain 
mechanic, a cabinetmaker, but a genuis at his trade. After having been prosperous 
in business, he wished to aid young men apprenticed to the trade of furniture mak- 
ing and carving in his native town. 
» Under fortes laws youths who, after ines ing passed through the public schools 
intend to learn a trade, are required to continue attending some school for some 
nights during the week and for two hours on Sunday. Such schools are called 
“Fortbildungsschulen,”’ a significant but untranslatable term signifying a school 
* where the education is to be continued. Mr. Kiefhaber had, through his own long 
experience, become convinced that such schools could not accomplish this purpose sat- 
isfactorily, because boys at the age of from 14 to 17, after having been hard at work all 
day long, can not be in a condition, either physically or mentally, to attend school for 
hours with any benefit to themselves. He therefore conceived the idea of establish- 
ing the school above referred to. To accomplish his object, however, he needed the 
assistance of the Magdeburg union in the line of cabinetmaking, sculpturing, and 
carving. Their cooperation was granted him to the fullest extent. All the boss 
mechanics of the cabinetmakers, though most of them are men without any means, 
and therefore can ill afford to lose even time, agreed to send each of their appren- 
tices to this school for a whole forenoon in every week, and also to take turns in 
assisting in the work of teaching. As these lessons are given every day from 8 to 12 
o’clock, each apprentice in Magdeburg gets four lessons a week, all bearing directly 
upon his future work. 
I believe it is impossible to conceive of anything more practical than the teaching 
in these classes, of which there are three, as it is a three years’ course. No question 
is put, no fact explained, no definition given, and no drawing made, but has some 
bearing upon either the materials or the tools or the purposes of the combined trades 
mentioned above. No step forward is taken until the why and wherefore of the 
preceding step has been fully understood by everyone in the class. And, as in all 
schools of like character, great stress is laid upon free-hand drawing. This is to give 
the young men not only all the technical knowledge needed, but also to train the 
eye and the mind in designing every part of the various styles of furniture, as well 
as artistic decorations in wood carving and inlaid woodwork. Such work, when 
- added to talent and diligence, must lead to thoroughness and originality. 
The young men in the last year’s course were scattered all over the room, each 
standing before a blackboard, engaged in drawing some part of a piece of furniture 
or some ornamental carving, while the teacher moved about examining the work. 
Upon inquiry, I was told that this was a lesson reviewing, in an objective way, the 
oral instruction given by the teacher at the last recitation. I will add that every 
student was given a different part of the work, so that no two of them had the same 
drawing to make. 
There are only a few salaried teachers employed, while there are always several 
boss mechanics present, as already stated, assisting in various ways. This must be 
an excellent way for these men to get and maintain the confidence and respect of 
their apprentices; for when young people see that their masters are not only able to 
show them how to handle tools in the workshop, but are also fully capable of 
instructing them theoretically, it can not fail to have a beneficial influence upon the 
relations between the master and the apprentices. Surely such teaching unites 
theory and practice in a wonderfully complete way. 
I have already said that the boss mechanies in the cabinetmakers’ trade union con- 
tribute their own time to this school without any compensation, and also give each 
apprentice one full forenoon in every week to attend the school. This is a great.

sacrifice for most of them. Mr. Kiefhaber, the founder of the school, for several 
years not only devoted his own time to this work, but has paid most of the expenses 
himself. Surely, not the least interesting feature of this institution is its benevolent 
object of reaching young people from the humblest walks of life, elevating and educat- 
ing them so as to make of them good mechanics, artisans, and citizens. 
The attention of the Government, both municipal and national, is now being 
called to the importance of this work, and it is hoped that the institution will soon 
be placed on a sounder financial basis. I have no doubt that this school, if properly 
supported and wisely conducted, will, in course of time, build up in Magdeburg an 
industry which will give employment to hundreds of artisans and mechanics, and 
bring renown to the city for its manufacture of fine and artistic furniture, as Dresden 
is noted for its fine china ware, Munich for its works of art, Leipsic for being the 
great book mart, and so forth. 
To an American this school for apprentices at Magdeburg is interesting, chiefly 
because it again shows to what an extent intellectual and technical training is carried 
on in this country in order to achieve and maintain the foremost position in the 
industrial world. 
Henry W. Diepericu, Consul. 
Bremen, April 4, 1900. 
COMMERCIAL UNIVERSITY FOR HAMBURG. 
The Berlin correspondent of the London Daily Mail, in a dispatch to that paper, 
says: : 
A movement is being started at Hamburg which should prove of exceptional inter- 
est'to British commercial and shipping circies. 
The very important and wealthy Association of Hamburg Landowners proposes 
to found a commercial university at Germany’s foremost seaport. The institute will 
have chairs for all scientific and technical branches in any way connected with gen- 
eral commerce. : 
Besides purely commercial maiters, it will include lectures on history, geography, 
natural history, modern languages, international and maritime law, tropical diseases, 
shipbuilding, and harbor constructions. 
As the new institute will enjoy all rights of the German universities and higher 
technical schools, it is expected that a large number of foreign students will be 
induced to attend the lectures. 
This programme speaks for itself. Germany has Jed, and is still leading, the 
world in commercial education. For many years its commercial schools have been 
preparing young men to go out into the world to take up lucrative and important 
positions. These young men are selling in distant countries products of the Empire, 
ranging from a locomotive to a clothespin. Opportunities for industrial enterprise 
are immediately reported. The German commercial traveler always speaks the lan- 
guage of the country in which he attempts to sell goods. This gives him an immense 
advantage over his English or American competitor, who, as a rule, is lacking in 
this essential qualification. The efficiency of these commercial travelers is to be 
attributed directly to their training. If we had similar colleges of commerce in our 
country, it is safe to say that our export trade could be largely increased.

INTRODUCTION. 
The authors of ‘‘Minerva, Jahrbuch der Universtiiten der Welt”? (K. Triibner and 
F. Mentz), which is the chief source of information offered in the following lists, say 
that they have submitted their work at various stages of completion to different pro- 
fessors of the countries mentioned, so that they are assured that their decision as to 
which of the learned institutions of the world should be regarded as universities is 
upheld by the most trustworthy authority. They describe their Jahrbuch as a col- 
lection of names of teaching bodies, of universities, or similar institutions of the 
world. 
Since this Report of the Bureau of Education contains direct information concern- 
ing the higher institutions of learning in the United States, they have been omitted 
from the following lists, which are devoted exclusively to foreign institutions.

TEACHERS’ SALARIES IN CITIES. 
The average amount paid to members of the teaching profession in cities of over 
8,000 inhabitants shows a marked increase in 1898-99 over 1897-98, The averages 
for the last nine years have been as follows: 
       
  1890-91. - - $506. 00 $629. 49 
1891-92... mins: Leal 624. 37

1893-94 - 608.94 688. 385

  The course of tho averago salary is supposed in a general way to show whether 
the emoluments of the business of teaching increase or decrease, and what may 
be expected by persons entering the profession. Ordinarily the item may be so 
accepted, but the vagaries of averages are well known, and in exceptional cases 
they may lead to inferences far from correct. Two instances which occurred in 
the knowledge of the writer will servo to illustrate this. The ‘average salary” 
paid to teachers, as disclosed by the statistical return of a prosperous city, showed 
aremarkable falling off recently, and attracted attention because it was known 
that there had been no cutting of salaries there. Investigation led to the discovery 
that a number of teachers in training, who had previously served without pay, 
had been put on tho salary lists at $150 a year. A sudden drop in the “average 
salary” resulted. Another city, during the financial difficulties of a few years 
ago, to save expenses discharged all principals’ assistants and many of the lower- 
salaried teachers. The ‘‘average salary” of the teachers who remained conse- 
quently showed a considerable increase. : 
In one of these cases no teacher received less than before, and the small salary 
of $15 a: month was undoubtedly a great boon to a class of young students. The 
lower ‘‘average” that was caused might have been taken of itself as an indication 
that the body of teachers as a whole were not as well off as before, while the 
opposite was true. In the other case, mary of the teachers were actually thrown 
out of employment, and the others were in a much worse condition than before, 
since they had to do a great deal more for the money they received. The higher 
“average salary” in that instance meant a misfortune for the guild as a whole. 
Even in cases not so extreme as these, fluctuations of averages frequently occur 
without any change either in the salary schedule or in policy. The employment 
of more teachers of the lesser grades will lower the average, and the appointment 
of additional principals or supervisors in the higher grades of pay will raise it. 
When new positions are to be filled it rarely happens that the relative numbers of 
high and low salaries are maintained in precisely the same proportion as in the 
older positions, though in a general way the same relation between them is

observed. Consequently the ‘‘average salary” in any city is a continually fluc- 
tuating quantity. This meaningless fluctuation, for such it is in reality, is ordi- 
narily not great, and it tends to disappear when numbers of localities are combined 
in the same calculation. It is not so evident in State statistics, and is still less so 
in those of the country at large. 
Notwithstanding all the anomalies that might be recalled, actual changes of 
salary schedules are quickly shown in the averages, and under normal conditions 
marked changes in the averages may be taken to indicate actual changes in the 
schedules in the same direction. Certainly a series of changes of similar kind is 
significant, and the gradual increase from $606 in 1890 to $638.35 in 1898-99 must 
mean that the teaching body receive more for their services than at any previous 
time.

It will be seen that although the average has fallen in a number of the States, 
all the divisions as wholes, except the Western, show important increases. Many 
of the variations in the State averages would undoubtedly fall under the descrip- 
tion of ‘‘meaningiess fluctuations,” to which reference was made in a previous 
paragraph, but there are plain indications of actual changes of salaries, those 
looking toward increase predominating. For example: 
In Massachusetts there were 287 additional supervising and teaching positions, 
and the excess of salaries paid in 1898-99 over 1897-98 amounted to $517,994. Evi- 
dently there must have been important improvements in salary schedules some- 
where. 
On the other hand, in the State of Washington the number of persons employed 
was increased by 71, but the aggregate of salaries paid was $9,284 less in 1898-99 
than in 1897-98, This could only have come about by wage-cutting. Further 
examination shows that the sufferers lived in Spokane and Tacoma. The number 
of teachers was increased in both those cities, but the whole amount paid them was 
less by $13,718 in Spokane, and less by $24,052 in Tacoma. 
Montana furnishes an example in which it was possible for a heavy reduction 
in the average salary to have occurred without reducing the amount paid to any 
individual or that assigned to any position. Fifty more teachers were employed 
in 1898-99 than in 1897-98, and $24,215 more was paid in salaries. A reduction of 
$47.49 appears in the average salary, yet the pay of all the old positions may have 
remained just as before and the 50 new teachers may have received $484 each, or 
salaries averaging that amount. 
The great cities would naturally ke expected to pay the best salaries. Cost of 
living is highest, as a rule, in them, and they are supposed to demand the best talent 
available. The table following shows the averages for all the cities which had 
over 100,000 inhabitants, according to the Eleventh Census. The figures speak 
for themselves,

TEACHERS’ PENSIONS AND ANNUITIES. 
REPORT OF TEACHERS’ PENSION COMMITTEE IN CHICAGO, ILL., FOR 1899. 
Members Teachers and Employees’ Pension and Retirement Fund Association 
Public Schools of Chicago: 
At the delegate convention of the members of the association held last June 
to consider the practical workings of the law, the condition of the fund, and to 
suggest changes, if any, to be recommended, two permanent committees ‘were 
appointed—one on information and publication, the second on investigation of 
the pension roll and the compiling of financial statistics. The chairman of the 
general convention was made a member of both committees. 
The finance committee has compiled the following statistical report, and in 
accordance with a resolution of the convention, the facts are furnished to the 
School Weekly for the information of the members. 
Contributors to the pension fund are urged to give these statistics careful con- 
sideration. The information committee invites discussion and suggestions sug- 
gested by these facts as to what action should be taken, if any, in the near future 
as to changes that should be made in the law or the general working of the 
present plans adopted by the trustees of the fund. 
The School Weekly generously offers its columns for any communications that 
may be thought by the committee to be of general interest. 
Such suggestions may be sent to the undersigned, and they will be given careful 
consideration by the committee. 
Joun Ray, Chairman. 
Mary Darrow O.xson, Secretary. 
STATEMENT OF COMMITTEE ON STATISTICS, 
To the Teachers of Chicago: 
The committee appointed by your delegate convention of last June to compile 
statistics relating to the pension roll and pension fund herewith submits its report 
through the columns of the School Weekly. 
The statistics here presented are arranged under four heads: 
Table 1 contains the roll of pensioners complete to January 1, 1900, with date 
of entry upon the roll, sum received each month, total amount received to Janu-
-P-A-G-E-239
TEACHERS’ PENSIONS AND ANNUITIES. 1479 
ary 1, 1900, yearly assessments, and lastly, total amount contributed by each pen- 
sioner to the pension fund from the 1 per cent assessment on salary at retiring. 
Table 2 shows the number of pensioners on the roll since September, 1896, by 
months, and the amount paid out on pensions for each month since then up to 
January 1, 1900. 
‘Table 3 shows the annual collections or receipts from all sources for the benefit 
of the pension fund from January 1, 1896, to January 1, 1900, and also the yearly 
disbursements for pensions alone for the game period. 
Table 4 contains a carefully prepared estimate based on Wiggleworth's tables 
of expectancy of life at 40, 45, 50, 55, and 60 years, the calculation being based 
upon minimum ($40), maximum ($66), and average ($50) monthly payments to 
pensioners at the present time. This table shows the total amount that would 
be paid to each pensioner and the total amount that would be received from each 
pensioner on the basis of expectancy. 
Although great care has been used in compiling these statistics, the committee 
is aware that some inaccuracies will be found, but it is quite certain that in the 
main the tables are correct. A carefully prepared review of these tables is in 
course of preparation by the committee on information. This review will con- 
tain recommendations and suggestions for increasing and safeguarding the pension 
fund, and will in due time be published in the School Weekly. 
Auditor Custer and Secretary Legner state that additions of the five or six 
naines to the pension roll at the last meeting of the pension board necessitated 
the selling of some securities in order to meet obligations now outstanding. 
Respectfully submitted.

RETIREMENT FUND IN SOUTH CAROLINA. 
By an act of the general assembly of South Carolina, approved on the 29th of 
January, 1898, the board of public school commissioners for the city of Charleston 
established ‘‘ The public school teachers’ retirement fund.” 
This fund is administered by a board of trustees composed of the chairman of 
the city board of school commissioners, two other commissioners chosen by the 
said board, the superintendent of the city public schools as ex-officio secretary and 
treasurer, and a citizen to be elected by the teachers of the city public schools 
every four years. 
The fund consists of 10 per cent for the first five years and of 4 per cent ever 
thereafter of the gross income of the special school tax paid by the taxpayers of 
the city of Charleston. 
Every teacher in the public schools of the city of Charleston who is over the 
age of 65 years, and shall have taught in them for twenty-five years next pre- 
ceding the time of retirement, shail have the right voluntarily to retire from such 
service, and upon the certificate of the city board of school commissioners that he 
or she stands in need of maintenance shall become a beneficiary, and shall be 
entitled to an annuity for the remainder of his or her life. This annuity shall in 
no case exceed the sum of $250 in any one year. 
Every teacher in the public schools of the city of Charleston who shall have 
taught continuously therein for at least twenty years, and has become incapac- 
itated mentally or physically, may retire and become a beneficiary of the fund, 
provided that the annuity shall cease when such incapacity ceases. 
There is a local teachers’ henefit association whose object is to relieve sick 
teachers by the payment of 75 cents a day for ten school days, and 50 cents a day 
for the remaining ten days of a school month, should the sickness continue for 
that period.

  THE TEACHING FORCE IN ENGLAND AND WALES. 1481 
THE PENSION LAW OF CINCINNATI, OHIO, 
From Cincinnati comes the report that the law, passed by the Ohio legislature 
some years ago, which enables the teachers to establish and maintain a pension 
fund, had to be seriously amended in order to prevent a depletion of the fund. 
Instead of 1 per cent of the salary, a teacher will now be taxed $2 for every month 
of the school year, or $20 per annum. No difference is made between teachers and 
principals. A teacher may retire from service and claim his pension after thirty 
years’ service, and he then draws a pension of $10 for every year he served; hence 
his pension will amount to $300 after thirty years, $400 after forty years, but no 
pension over $300 will be paid. In cases of disability before the thirtieth year of 
service is reached, a pension may be paid, but it can not be larger than $10 for 
every year of service. One paragraph of the amended law gives satisfaction to the 
teachers, namely, that hereafter no teacher can be dismissed arbitrarily by the 
superintendent, but his case must be investigated by a committee of the city school 
board upon written complaint of the superintendent. 
THE TEACHING FORCE IN ENGLAND AND WALES. 
The London Schoolmaster, in its issue of May 5, 1900, analyzes the annual 
returns of the ‘‘ Education department” for 1899, and reveals some interesting 
facts from which the following, concerning the number, age, and qualification of 
the teaching force, as well as the amounts paid them, are gleaned. It says: ‘‘ This 
question (respecting the quality and quantity of teachers) represents an item of 
first-class importance; and no one who knows the lack of adequate financial sup- 
port under which the great bulk of the voluntary schools, and practically all the 
rural schools (both board and voluntary or church schools), suffer, will be sur- 
prised to learn that in very many cases the teaching staff is woefully insufficient 
and inefficient.” Elementary school teachers are of four classes: 
(1) Adults who have gone through all the grades of training and are classed as 
fully certificated. 
(2) Teachers who have been apprenticed as pupil teachers, but have not com- 
pleted the course for the teacher's certificate. These are styled ex-pupil teachers, 
(3) Young women over 18 years of age—technically known as “article 68’s ”— 
who have no professional qualification whatever, except that, in the opinion of the 
inspector, they are presentable young persons and can give evidence that they 
have been successfully vaccinated. 
(4) Juvenile apprentices to the art of teaching, known as pupil teachers. 
Under any efficient system of education, neither the ‘Article 68's” nor the pupil 
teachers would be looked upon as efficient members of the school staff. But itis 
too common an experience to find English schools—especially voluntary schools 
and rural board schools—staffed almost entirely with these inefficient supernu- 
meraries. The whole teaching force (including these inefficient juveniles) in Eng- 
land and Wales at the present time (the report is for 1899) consists of 150,524 
persons, distributed as Table Ashows. Tables B,C, D,and E give further detailsin 
relative and absolute numbers, and the facts as related tu Scotland are added. 
The report does not mention Ireland. The table ‘Salaries of teachers ” has been 
made serviceable to American readers by stating the amounts in dollars and cents.

THE FACTS IN SCOTLAND IN 1893. 
In 1898 Scotland had 17,836 teachers—9,975 certificated adults, or 56 per cent; 
2,198 uncertificated adults, or 12 per cent, and 5,668 juveniles, or 32 percent. With 
regard to sex they were divided into 5,485 men or boys (80 per cent) and 12,401 
women or girls (70 per cent). Divided into adults and juveniles we get: Adults, 
12,168, or 68 per cent, and juveniles 5,668, or 32 per cent. 
GENERAL REMARKS. 
The foregoing analysis of the composition of the teaching force illustrates in 
the first place the extent to which women are dispossessing men in the work of 
teaching. To-day in England and Wales, as will be seen by consulting the tables, 
roughly speaking, three-fourths of the teachers are women and girls. In the year 
1851 70 per cent of the teaching force were men and boys and 380 per cent women 
and girls. In 1870 the proportions of the sexes were just about equal, and now 
they are 24.8 per cent men and boys and 75.2 per cent women and girls. Another 
consideration is the rapid increase in the number of unqualified adult teachers, 
known as ‘“‘Article 68's.” In ten years the number of these teachers engaged has 
risen from 5,210 to 16,717. (See explanatory remarks in the introduction.)

  FOREIGN STUDENTS IN GERMANY. 1485 
FOREIGN STUDENTS IN GERMAN ONIVERSITIES. 
During the summer semester of 1899 there were 2,284 foreigners matriculated 
in German universities, This number does not include about 2,000 foreign 
“hearers” who could not be matriculated, owing to their want of the preparation 
prescribed by law; nor does the number include the foreign students of polytech- 
nica, art academies, music conservatories, agricultural, forestry, and mining acad- 
emies. The Annual Report of this Bureau for 1896 gives a summary of foreign 
students in polytechnica, agricultural, forestry, and mining academies which 
shows a total of 1,276. If the art and music students were added, the total would 
rise to 2,000. The following figures have reference to foreign university students 
only. 
OF the 2,284 students, 563 studied philosophy, philology, and history; 480 studied 
mathematics and natural science; 477 studied medicine; 299, law; 284, agriculture, 
forestry, and political economy; 130, theology, and 31, dentistry, making a total of 
2,414, which indicates that some—130—study in two faculties. 
The ‘‘hearers” (nonmaitriculated students) have all the privileges of regular 
students, such as attendance at lectures and exercises, use of library, laboratories, 
and other agencies if they pay the prescribed fees; but not being matriculated, 
their names are not kept on the rolls, nor can they acquire degrees or compete in 
state examinations, the successful passing of which opens up a career in the 
service of the State, which is coveted by native Germans and is granted almost 
exclusively to them. ° 
Foreign students came from nearly all the civilized countries. From Russia 
594, Austria-Hungary 467, Switzerland 289, England 159, Bulgaria 69, the Nether- 
lands 50, France 41, Servia 39, Italy 37, Turkey 33, Roumania 32, Sweden and Nor- 
way 81, Luxemburg 24, Greece 23, Belgium 19, Denmark 3, Montenegro 3, Spain 
8; total from Burope, 1,857. From Asia, chiefly from Japan, came 101; from 
Africa 21, from Australia 5, and from America 300. The report fails to specify 
from what part of America the last mentioned came. 
The following numbers will show which universities are preferred by foreign- 
ers: Berlin had 655 foreign students, Leipzig 322, Heidelberg 205, Munich 195, Halle 
188, Freiburg 96, Gottingen 93, Strassburg 75, Jena 71, Marburg €6, Wiirzburg 59, 
Bonn 50, Kénigsburg 49, Tiibingen 48, Breslau 40, Giessen 35, Erlangen 33, Greifs- 
wald 22, Kiel 22, Rostock 7, and Minster 2. 
WOMEN STUDENTS IN PRUSSIAN UNIVERSITIES. 
As will be seen from the following tables, statistics of all the 22 German uni- 
versitios are not offered, but only of the 10 Prussian universities, The Leipzig 
att (No. 849, July 12, 1899) makes the compilation, chiefly because the 
Prussian Government has been opposed to the admission of women students. It 
still debars them from matriculation and only allows them to enter as ‘“‘ hearers.” 
The difference between matriculated students and hearers is explained in the preced- 
ing article. The following tables speak for themselves. They give thenumber of 
women students, their nationality, age, religion, their marital relations, the cccu- 
pation of their fathers, their purposes of study, and the branches they select.

  1488 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
CAUSES OF MORTALITY AMONG TEACHERS. 
Concerning the causes of mortality among teachers, some interesting data are 
published by the Deutsche Lehrerzeitung, in Leipzig, from which the following 
information is taken and published here with a view to inciting similar investiga- 
tions in this country. The facts given concerning teachers refer to Gerinan teach- 
ers only. In all probability the corresponding figures for the United States will 
vary from those found in Germany, the teachers there being mostly men, while 
here, at least in the cities, they are almost exclusively women. 
The profession of a person has as much influence upon the duration of life as 
his pecuniary circumstances. Certain occupations and professions are considered 
inimical to life, as, for instance, those of hotel keepers and hotel servants, glass 
blowers, musicians, and medical practitioners. Others seem to be favored with 
long life, notaby those of clergymen and independent farmers. Dr. Richardson, 
in his English statistics of mortality, states that among each 1,000 Protestant 
clergymen in the vigorous age between 25 and 45 years, during 1890-1892, the 
number dying was 4.72, on an average; of farmers the average per 1,000 was 5.64; 
of medical practitioners, 10.24; of musicians, 12.68; of glass blowers, 14.11; of 
hotel keepers, 18.81. 
Dr. Richardson calculated the mortality of 70 occupations or professions, and 
found that the printers occupy the third highest place in the list of mortality. 
Taking the average mortality of ull the 70 occupations as 100 per cent, the printers 
average 117 per cent. Almost 60 per cent of the printers and compositors die of 
consumption at the comparatively early age of 35. 
Generally speaking, the mortality of elementary school-teachers is not very low, 
but neither is it very high. Taking the average mortality of well-situated strata 
of the population (civil officers, for instance) as 100 per cent during the vigorous 
years from 21 to 45, the two German physicians, Karup and Gollmer, calculate 
the mortality of university professors to be 64.6 per cent; that of Protestant clergy- 
men, 70.2 per cent; that of teachers of preparatory or high schools, 71.4 per cent; 
that of elementary teachers, 84.6 per cent; that of medical men, 125.9 per cent. 
Very different proportions are found if the causes of death are considered. Cer- 
tain diseases are found among teachers oftener than among persons engaged in 
other occupations, notably consumption, chronic lung catarrh, and acute diseases 
of the respiratory organs, such as inflammation of the lungs and pneumonia and 
bronchitis. To a large extent they may be considered professional diseases of 
teachers and speakers. 
Rural teachers, especially, die young. W,hile generally the mortality in cities is 
somewhat greater than in the country, the numerous inconveniences and the 
accumulated troubles to which rural teachers are subjected—such us poor dwell- 
ings, much school dust, defective warming and ventilation in schoolrooms, over- 
crowded classes, ungraded schools, small salaries, long hours, additional service 
in church as organists and choir leaders which necessitates outdoor walking in 
all kinds of weather, and, above all, the greater responsibility—cause a greater 
mortality among rural teachers in Central Europe. 
Taking as astandard measure the mortality from each disease of tolerably well- 
situated civil officers—of administration and justice, for instance—and of similar 
social strata, and calling this the normal rate for such disease, or 100 per cent, we 
find the mortality of elementary teacliers during the years of vigor (from 46 to 60) 
to be 110.7 per cent caused by tuberculosis, 108.2 per cent caused by chronic lung 
catarrh, and 129.4 per cent caused by constitutional diseases, such as disorders of 
the digestive and kindred organs. These figures show that the normal mortality 
is far surpassed by that of teachers in every case. The last-named cause is found 
singular-y often among city teachers during the age of 25 to 60 years, as is seen 
from the foilowing figures: Taking the same normal standard mentioned before,
-P-A-G-E-249
  A NEW HISTORY OF EDUCATION. 1489 
we find that Protestant clergymen do not reach it, only 67.5 per cent dying from ~ 
that cause, but 111.3 per cent of rural teachers and 130.2 per cent of city teachers. 
During old age that difference becomes still more pronounced—rural teachers 
97.6 per cent, city teachers 139 per cent. This high percentage of mortality is, 
however, chiefly found in South Germany, where 142.8 per cent of city teachers 
die of kidney and liver troubles or disturbances of the digestive organs. Also, 
with regard to diseases of the organs of circulation and fatal accidents, the 
teachers of southern States show a higher percentage, to wit, north, 69.9 per 
cent and 88.1 per cent, respectively; south, 105.7 per cent and 110.2 per cent. 
This is not strange, if the fact be considered that the general mortality in south- 
ern is greater than in northern Germany; local circumstances, the mode of living, 
and especially injurious dietary habits may be the causes. 
How destructive the so-called professional diseases are to teachers may be seen 
from the list prepared by the two physicians before mentioned, Drs. Karup and 
Gollmer, after investigations and inquiries made during a number of years. The 
first established a normal rate of mortality as a standard measure, and then ranged 
the following groups as follows:

However, if all the causes of death are considered without distinction, except 
as to the period of calculation and age at time of decease, the mortality of teachers 
can not be said to be very high. The average figures during the age of 26 to 60 
years,! compared with the normal mortality during the same year, are as follows: 
University professors, 56.7 per cent; Protestant clergymen (counted among the 
teachers because they teach religion in secondary schools) , 73.6 per cent; elementary 
teachers in cities, 75.8 per cent; teachers in secondary schools, 77.4 per cent; ele- 
mentary teachers in rural districts, 84.5 per cent; Catholic clergymen, 103.6 per 
cent; practicing physicians, 116.2 per cent. 
Dr. Sigel, a physician of the health office in Leipzig, examined in October, 1895, 
all the teachers of that city, and found 42.8 per cent of them suffering from nerv- 
ousness, chronic catarrh of the throat, lung trouble, and other so-called profes- 
sional diseases. 
A NEW HISTORY OF EDUCATION. 
Among the methods of presenting the history of education there are two distinct, 
if not antagonistic ones; the one deals exclusively, or chiefly, with the theories and 
plans of reform which in the course of centuries have been advanced by philoso- 
phers, and in tura have agitated the educational world. This mode of presenting 
and studying the history of education is not unprofitable, but it is not, properly 
speaking, the history so much as itis the theories of education such hooks present. 
The other method is the one which exclusively deals with facts gleaned from 
  
1 These limits are taken because the twenty-fifth year of age is usually the year in which Ger- 
man teachers get their definite appointment, and the sixtieth year the one in which they may 
be retired on a pension.

documentary sources, from governmental decrees, and from school programmes 
and chronicles, and thus presents, or attempts to present, actual conditions. Itis 
“ Quellenstudium,” study of original sources, which is emphasized by modern 
scholars generally. Itis the method advocated in particular by modern historians, 
and is in accordamce with the methods applied in teaching and studying naturay 
history and science. This mode of procedure—the study of historical sources—has 
taken hold of educational as it has of theological students. 
Prof. Stephan Waetzoldt (see Annual Report of 1894-95, page 460) says: 
Tho science of education has only recently begun to sever itself from speculative 
theories and turn toward historic development of the momenta that constitute it. 
There is still too much system and theoretical speculation and construction, while 
unbiased observation and fixation of facts are not as frequently found as desirable. 
Rarely are the forms of the education of a certain era, or of a country, viewed in 
connection with the entire development of the people. Comparative pedagogy is 
stillin its infancy. ‘The questions: How does a nation, an era, a society arrive at 
aparticular form of education? and Why is it a historically necessary result? 
present themselves to the student. He whohas accustomed himself to understand 
historically that which exists in the education of a nation, and compares it with 
the work and the results of other nations upon similar lines, will not be apt to 
believe in the possibility or utility of direct copies and adaptations; he will try to 
understand and explain, but will refrain from copying, for in theend every nation 
finds that which is best adapted to its needs, and it finds it in its own way. 
This method of comparative study of education has been employed by Dr. Karl 
Schmidt in his famous work of four volumes, which for thoroughness and philo- 
sophic insight is not surpassed by any other on the history of education. But this 
work is not a presentation of original sources, however sound may be its foundation. 
Recently another German work has made its appearance following independ- 
ently a line of research in documentary sources, and thus commending itself to_ 
the student. It is a work bearing a Latin name—Monumenta Germanic Peeda 
gogica. Nineteen volumes have appeared up to April, 1900. Its object is to intro- 
duce the reader directly to the original historical sources, A statement of its 
contents will show what it offers. Volumes I and VIII present the Brunswick 
governmental school regulations and decrees, which are the first important authori- 
tative orders given for the establishment and regulation of schools by Protestant 
princes, and are, therefore, of paramount interest in showing how the schools» 
duying the Reformation, began to be severed from the church and how they 
became stateinstitutions. Volumes II, V,1X,and XVI present the original “Ratio 
Studiorum” prescribed for the schocls of the Jesuits. In view of the fact that 
for more than a hundred years the schools of that religious order in Europe were 
the best seats of learning below the universities, this publication is very wilcome. 
It gives an insight into documents not easily available. Volume III contains the. 
h story of mathematical instraction in Germany during the Middle Ages. Yol 
ume IV contains the German catechisms of the Bohemian and Moravian Brethren, 
‘Volumes VI and VIII contain the regulations and orders of the Saxon schools in 
Siebenburgen (in Hungary). Volume VII presents a biography based on docu- 
mentary evidences of Luther's friend, the reformer Philip Melanchthon, whom 
cotemporary historians called Preceptor Germaniz. Volume XII contains the 
Doctrinale of Alexander de Villa Dei. Volume XIV contains the history of edu- 
cation in Bavaria, and Volume XIX that of the Bavarian Palatinate. Volumes X, 
Xi, XV, XVII, and XVIII give an account of the history of military education 
during the last centuries. This last work reaches up to the year 1896, and is there- 
fore quite compete. Further volumes will appear in time, since the publication 
of this valuable undertaking has been secured by a subsidy from the imperial 
exchequer by a vote of the Reichstag, likewise by substantial aid promised by the 
Prussian Department of Public Education and learned societies, as well as the 
National Teachers’ Association. It is to be regretted that the publication pro- 
ceeds rather slowly—about two volumes a year—but in the interest of thorough 
scholarship this may, perhaps, be best.

CHAPTER. XXXVI. 
CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 
Recent Laws ReLatine To Crry ScHooL Boarps. 
In the Report of this Office for 1895-96 was a chapter (Chapter I, p. 3) describing 
typical laws relating to city school systems as they were then organized. Tho 
four years: since that paper was written have been preeminently a period of 
change and experiment. The variations from the normal type then described 
have been so radical, so numerous, ang of such importance that it would be diffi- 
cult now to say just what the normal type is. The cities in which the changes 
have been made that have excited the most attention and aroused the most dis- 
cussion are San Francisco, Cal.; Washington, D. C.; Atlanta, Ga.; Indianapolis, 
Ind.; Baltimore, Md.; St. Louis, Mo.; New York, N. ¥.; Rochester, N. Y.; 
Toledo, Ohio, and Milwaukee, Wis. In three other large cities—namely, Chicago, 
Til.; Boston, Mass., and Detroit, Mich.—laws along lines similar to those of the 
cities named have been urgently advocated, but none of them have yet been 
passed. 
The board of education has been preserved in all the new laws, but in the num- 
ber of members, manner of appointment, and duties and powers marked changes 
have been made. The principle which formerly prevailed universally, that service _ 
on the board was an honor to which no pay should be attached, has not been 
observed in two of the new laws, and paid boards are now advocated very fre- 
quently elsewhere, The San Francisco board as it is now constituted represents 
probably the widest departure from traditional policy, for there the board of only 
four men devote their entire time to the duties of the office and receive each $3,000 
ayear, Not more than two of its members may be of the same political party. 
The superintendent, an officer elected by the people, is ex officio a member of the 
board, but without the right to vote. Anelected superintendentis not a new thing 
in San Francisco, but a paid school board is. That has been a common plan of 
organizing police and fire boards, but it is a novelty as applied toschools. IRtis 
an experiment, to be sure, but the former law did not give satisfaction, and the 
San Francisco people appear to feel that whatever the outcome, it could be no 
worse than the condition of affairs under the old régime. In Washington the new 
board is to be paid, though the salary was avowedly attached to insure attendance 
at meetings and to secure more attention to school business. It is not sufficient 
to pay for all the time of the members, nor is it intended to. 
In the selection of members of the board the greatest innovation is developed in 
the Milwaukee law, which provides for the appointment by the mayor of a bi- 
partisan commission, who shall appoint the members of the board of school direct- 
1491  
-P-A-G-E-252
1492 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
ors. The question of ‘‘ responsibility to the people” is frequently discussed in con- 
nection with the selection of public officers, many holding that officials should be 
chosen directly by, and be responsible to, the people. Others oppose this because 
of the supposed demoralizing effects of elections and of the constant pandering to 
popular caprice that are said to result. The Milwaukee device removes the schools 
further from ‘‘the people” than any which has preceded it. The people elect the 
mayor, the mayor appoints the commission, the commission appoint the board, the 
board elect the superintendent, the superintendent, in practice, selects the princi- 
pals, the principals select the teachers, ' and the teachers teach theschools. Truly 
the school system has kept pace with the industrial world in the introduction of 
machinery; what a difference is this from the primitive plan by which the people 
in district meeting elected a teacher, and all was done! 
The Indianapolis law shows a peculiar feature in subjecting certain acts of the 
school board to the veto of a subordinate officer, one of its own appointees, namely, 
the business director. The idea is plainly copied from the Cleveland system, but 
the important difference is that in the latter city the director is coordinate with 
the legislative body and not dependent upon it for his position. It is not to be 
expected of human nature that an official will oppose to the point of antagonism 
the power that made him; yet that would naturally follow the independent use of 
the veto. In this case the right of veto does not give the director any real power 
except to necessitate the reconsideration of a measure of which he disapproves, 
for no greater vote is required to pass a resolution after the disapproval than 
before; the three votes necessary make a majority simply, there being but five 
members. It would seem, therefore, that the provision is intended merely to 
insure careful consideration of questions involving expenditure, but it is a remark- 
able one nevertheless. 
The New York law was designed to make as little change as possible in the 
existing local conditions in the several boroughs at the time of their consolidation 
into the greater city. New boards were brought into being for the smaller boroughs 
of Queens and Richmond, but the composition of the boards of the old city of New 
York and of the city of Brooklyn was absolutety unchanged when they became 
respectively the boroughs of Manhattan and the Bronx and the borough of 
Brooklyn. The supervision of the schools remains just as before, the title of the 
superintendents being changed to borough superintendents. The duties of the 
present city superintendent are mainly advisory, and he has no right to interfere 
in the actual conduct of any school in the city. The city board of education 
is charged with the apportionment of certain funds to the several boroughs, the 
purchase of sites and erection and repair of buildings, the purchase of school sup- 
plies, and, through its board of examiners,’ the examination and certification of 
teachers. The actual management of the schools remains with the local school 
boards: This system of divided responsibility has not proved satisfactory, and a 
commission is already at work to revise the city charter in this as in other respects, 
Itis expected that greater centralization of authority will be the outcome. Indeed, 
this was probably foreseen by the original framers of the charter, but it was felt 
at the time that wise policy demanded that as much as possible of local control 
should remain until the people became accustomed to the larger unit of govern- 
ment. Important changes, though not affecting the plan of organization, have 
already been made in the charter as it originally stood. The ‘‘Ahearn iaw,” passed 
in 1899, prescribing the minimum salaries of certain teachers, was published in 
full in the last Education Report.’ The ‘‘ Davis law,” passed at the last session of

by him and appointed by the board of education.

CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 1493 
the legislature (1900), still further regulates teachers’ salaries and prescribes a 
minimum amount to be appropriated for salaries of the supervising and teaching 
staff—namely, 4 mills on the dollar of taxable property of the city. 
The new laws for Atlanta and Washington were prompted more by the needs of 
a definite law of some kind than by defects of previous laws, for practically there 
were no previous laws. The Atlanta board of education was a mere creature of 
the city council, without any status whatever in the eyes of the State law. It 
might have been abolished at any time without warning by the city council. In 
Washington the laws have been for years fragmentary and chaotic, so that no one 
of the officials knew definitely what authority he had or did not have. 
The most conspicious feature that strikes one as common to all the recent-laws 
is the reduction in the size of the boards. This is in accordance with prevailing 
sentiment. The San Francisco board is the smallest yet organized, and was 
reduced to 4from 12. The Baltimore board was cut down from 22 to 9, St. Louis 
from 21 to 12, Indianapolis from 11 to 5, Milwaukee from 36 to 21, Atlanta from 
14 to 7, ete. 
The tendency, strongly marked. is to divorce legislative functions from the 
executive, retaining the former in the board and confiding the latter to paid 
experts. The tendency is equally apparent to separate business affairs from mat- 
ters which relate to instruction, assigning the one to a business director, and the 
other to the superintendent of instruction. These distinctions are well developed 
in the Toledo law, which has been frequently extolled as one of the best yet drawn, 
but they are just as strongly marked in other laws. 
The superintendent enjoys greater powers in most of the new laws in the 
appointment of teachers, in the preparation of the course of study, and in the 
selection of text-books. The choice of teachers from those on the eligible list is 
given to him absolutely in Indianapolis; and in Baltimore, St. Louis, Rochester, 
and Toledo the superintendent makes appointments subject to the confirmation of 
the board. In Milwaukee the superintendent is a member of the committee to 
make such appointments, and it is stated that in practice the choice really rests 
with him and the principal of the school in which a vacancy occurs.! In Boston, 
though the bill proposed recently for a reorganization of the board failed to 
become a law, a number of changes have been made in the powers of the superin- 
tendent by rule of the board itself in the line of the new laws applying to other 
cities. 
As arule, the Western statutes are very minute in their provisions, and are in 
striking contrast in this respect tosome of the Eastern enactments, .The Milwau- 
kee law contains 21 sections, and that of Indianapolis 84. On the other hand, the 
charter of the new board of education at Washington contains but four paragraphs, 
as follows: 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS. : 
The Commissioners of the District of Columbia are hereby authorized to appoint 
seven persons, bona fide residents and taxpayers of the District of Columbia, and 
who have been such for five years immediately preceding their appointment, who 
shall constitute a board of education and whose term of office shall be seven years, 
except that the terms of the persons first appointed shall terminate as foilows: 
One each year, to be determined by lot among the seven members of the board 
first appointed. The compensation of members of the board shall be $10 each for 
personal attendance at each meeting, but shall not exceed for any member $500 
per annum. The board shall have complete jurisdiction over all administrative 
matters connected with the public schools of the District of Columbia, except that 
all expenditures of public funds for such school purposes shall be made and 
accounted for as now provided by law under the direction and control of the Com- 
missioners of the District of Columbia. The board shall make all needful rules 
and regulations which may be proper for the government and control of said

schools, and shall make annual report to the Commissioners of the District of 
Columbia, who shall transmit the same to Congress, of the condition and opera- 
tions of said schools and the sanitary and structural condition of all buildings in 
use, as well as those in course of construction, with recommendations as respects 
needed changes. 
The board shall have power to appoint one superintendent for all the public 
schools of the District of Columbia, two assistant superintendents, one of whom, 
under the direction of the superintendent, shall have charge of schools for colored 
children; a secretary, and three clerks, and to remove said officers at its pleasure, 
and shall also have power to employ and remove all teachers, officers, and other 
employees connected with the public schools not already specified: Provided, That 
the graduates of the normal schools shall have preference in all cases when 
appointments of teachers for the grade schools are to be made. The superintend- 
ent shall annually submit to the board for its approval the course of studies and 
list of text-books and other apparatus to be used in said schools. 
The board shall annually transmit to the Commissioners of the District of 
Columbia an estimate in detail of the amount of money required for the public 
schools for the ensuing year, and said Commissioners shall include the same in 
their annual estimate of appropriations for the District of Columbia, with such 
recommendations as they may deem proper. 
The foregoing provisions under the head of ‘‘ Public schools” shall take effect 
on the ist day of July, 1900, and all acts and parts of acts in conflict herewith are 
hereby repealed.—[From ‘‘An act of Congress making appropriations to provide 
for the expenses of the government of the District of Columbia for the fiscal year 
ending June 30, 1901, and for other purposes,” approved June §, 1900.]

The increases reported above ‘are considerably below the normal increases in 
nearly everyitem. Theaverage attendancefor 1898-99 shows the smallest increase, 
both actually and proportionally, that has occurred since the present:method of 
presenting the city school statistics was inangurated in 1890-91. In-enrollment, 
too, the proportional increase is less than in any previous year within the time 
mentioned. The growth of citiesand of school systems does not always progress 
with uniform steps, and it maybe thatthe next year will witness an increase in 
school attendance that will more than make good the deficiencies of this year. 
But whether this occur or not, itis plain that from some cause the accustomed 
growth of city schools has been retarded. 
The history of growth in the past leads to the hope that the retardation is tem- 
porary only, but whether temporary or permanent it:is a matter of ‘importance, 
and considerable pains have been ‘taken to ascertain ‘tke causes. The following 
table shows, for all the cities which had over 100,000 inhabitants according to the 
Eleventh ‘Census, the enrollment for 1897-98 and for 1898-99, with increase or 
decrease, and percentage of the same; also the increase during the ten years from 
1887-88 to 1897-98, with the percentage.of increase and the average annual rate:

aIncreaso in schools other than kindergartens, 426; per cent of increase, 1.3. b Number belonging January 31. 
The whole of New York City as it is now organized is not given in the above, 
since it is impossible to give the statistics of the entire period desired for the 
boroughs of Queens and Richmond. Of the 28 cities in the list there has been in 
the past year an actual decrease in schoo! enro!lment in four, namely, in San Fran- 
cisco, Denver (District No.1), Indianapolis, and Rochester. In five—Detroit, St. 
Louis, Cincinnati, Allegheny, and Pittsburg—the schools have remained practi- 
cally stationary in regard to numbers. In all the others excepting New Orleans, 
Kansas City, Jersey City, Newark, and New York, the per cent of increase is 
decidedly below the average for the previous 10 years. 
Of the five cities last named special reasons have conduced to larger attendance in 
atleast 4. Jersey City has greatly extended her school facilities recently; 7 large 
buildings, long needed, have been opened, making possible the enrollment of a 
greatly increased number of children. The corporate limits of Kansas City have 
been extended, bringing 1,823 additional pupils into the school system; even with- 
out these, however, the increase was large. The New York City schools are still 
in the process of reformation following the legislation of 1895 and 1898. Largesums 
have been spent for new buildings, and salaries have been greatly increased; 
naturally the enrollment has taken a sharp upward turn. In Newark the kinder- 
garten system has been greatly extended during the year; 2,720 children were 
enrolled in the schools of that class in 1897-98, and 4,076 in 1898-99; the increase, 
therefore, in schools other than kindergartens was but 426—a very small number. 
No information is at hand concerning the conditions that produced an increase 
larger than the average in New Orleans, but that average has been so small—1.4 
per cent—that the excess this year has little general significance. It is plain that 
the condition of affairs which has affected the growth of the schools has been not 
local, but general. 
The printed reports which have been received throw very little light on the 
subject. Supt. E. P. Seaver, of Boston, remarks that ‘‘the increase in pupils, 
1,908, is surprisingly small, being but little more than one-half of that reported 
last year, 8,612, and considerably less than that reported year before last, 2,634,”! 
but-he offers no explanation. 
Supt. F, Louis Soldan, of St. Louis, states that “the slower rate of increase is 
in part accounted for by the fact that the growth in the population of the city 
during the past two years has been at a slower rate, or has receded in a small 
degree. Another possible reason is that during times of commercial prosperity, 
  
1 Boston School Document No. 3, 1899, p. T.  
-P-A-G-E-260
  1500 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
when there is an increased demand for labor, many young persons leave school to 
take up lucrative employment who without this chance would have continued in 
school for a longer period.”! 
Supt. C. G. Pearse, of Omaha, refers to the decrease of 219 in the number of 
persons of schoo! age in the city, and suggests carelessness on the part of the 
enumerators as a possible cause. In regard to the falling off in attendance he 
thinks the cause was ‘‘ the visitation of smallpox, which for months kept hundreds 
of children from school through fear of the disease or from unwillingness to sub- 
mit to vaccination.”’ Similarly Supt. G. F. T. Cook, of the colored schoo's of 
Washington, thinks that the decrease of 181 in his enrollment ‘‘ was due to the 
appearance of smallpox and to the rigid enforcement of the rule requiring vacci- 
nation or other protection against the disease asa condition for securing or retain- 
ing membership.”* The white schools of the city were, however, exposed to the 
same dangers and subject to the same rules, yet they showed an increase in enroll- 
ment, not a decrease. 
Supt. A. J. Smith, of St. Paul, assigns reasons which seem to have extended 
through a number of years, and are not applicable to the last year only. He says: 
“It has probably excited some surprise that in a city whose population has 
increased as rapidly as in St. Paul that there is not a larger increase in the school 
admissions. When, however, we consider that for several years there has been 
no increase in the number of sittings; that in many districts the schools are over- 
crowded; that many children can attend but one-half day; that the financial 
resources have been inadequate for years, we are enabled to account easily for the 
very heavy enrollment in the parochial schools. Aside from this, however, chil- 
dren are often withdrawn from school for no good reason whatever. The law of 
cumpulsory attendance keeps children under a certain age out of employment, 
but it does not keep them in school.” 
In none of the other reports at hand from the cities in the above list is there any 
comment or explanation touching the matter under consideration. It is plain, 
therefore, that it is impossible to find a singie e‘ficient cause by the process of 
combining reasons given from many sources. It is necessary to recur to the sta- 
tistics and seek for probabilities. 
The following hypotheses might suggest themselves as possible explanations: 
1. Loss of favor on the part of the public for the common schools. Combined 
with increased prosperity this would result in the withdrawal of pupils from the 
public schools for the purpose of going to private institutions. 
2. Unugual prevalence of contagious disease. The natural result of this, of 
course, would be to lessen all school attendance. 
3. General withdrawal of pupils to go to work. The return of “good times” 
has brought increased opportunity for employment, without doubt. If numbers 
of children are withhe!d from school for the purpose of adding to the family earn- 
ings the effect on the enrollment would soon be apparent. 
4, A check in the growth of the cities themselves. If the tide of migration 
were turned from the cities and if the clientage of the schools cease to increase, 
the schools themselves must perforce remain stationary. 
No one familiar with the attitude of the people toward the public-school system 
would admit for a moment the correctness of the first hypothesis. There is no 
evidence whatever that the schools have suffered in the eyes of the people or that 
there is less disposition now than at any previous time to patronize them. The 
statistics of private schools show a slight gain, it is true, as compared with public 
schools, but the difference is insignificant, amounting to only one-fifth of 1 per cent

(i. e. from 18.7 to 18.9 per cent of the whole enrollment), and the rate of growth 
of the private institutions was, like the public schoo's, considerably less than in 
previous years. The first hypothesis may be dismissed at once as unreasonable. 
As to contagious and infectious diseases, these prevail to some extentin all parts 
of the country every year, butso far from increasing, it is more likely that the con- 
stant tendency is toward improvement. Any disease that is communicable is 
preventable, and the means of prevention are constantly becoming better and more 
generally known. Methods of treatment also show steady improvement, and a 
reasonable presumption based upon the general progress of medical science is that 
the average duration of illness from any disease, in case of recovery, becomes less 
and less. This does not imply that the necessary course of a disease is shortened, 
but that its virulence is lessened and that in a growing proportion of cases serious 
sequelae are prevented. The effect of contagion upon school enrollment and 
attendance in the country as a whole may be assumed to be of less importance 
from year to year. There has been no general epidemic of any sort during the 
past twelve months and the supposition that disease is responsible for any general 
lack ot school enrollment is plainly without foundation in fact. 
The next hypothesis seems to be based on more reasonable grounds, and it is 
probable that many children and youths are now at work who would be in school 
in less prosperoustimes. Whether the number is proportionally considerable is the 
question. The value of education receives ever increasing recognition, and parents 
are more and more reluctant to take their children from school before they have 
finished the course. The steady growthof high schools has proved that tobe true. 
The tendency is increasing to keep the children in school as long as possible, and if 
any are taken out to go to work the oldest are naturally the first taken. The com- 
pulsory attendance laws operate to the same effect; in large proportion of the cities 
children are required to attend school till they are 14 years old. Losses on account 
of employment, therefore, would be most noticeable in the higher grades, and if 
such losses reach considerable proportions the high school would suffer conspicu- 
uously. But this has occurred in very fewplaces. In all the cities named below, 
excepting seven, high schools have grown at a greater rate than the elementary 
schools. Actual losses in high-school enrollment are reported in seven cities only; 
except in St. Louis and Minneapolis those losses were small and in the latter city, 
certain changes in the high schools themselves presumably caused the falling off, 
The following table shows the differences in high-school enrollment in 1897-98 
and 1898-99:

a High schools recently: established. 
Tn places in which the growth of high schools has been disproportionately large, 
like Washington, Detroit, Kansas City, and Philadelphia, it is reasonable to infer 
that the schools Have not suffered seriously from extensive withdrawals for the 
purpose of employment. In regard to other places like San Francisco, St. Louis, 
and’ Omaha, the opposite was probably true, though other circumstances may have 
been influential to bring about the same result. 
In regard to the growth of cities in the last year, the only evidence we have is 
the annual school census and the city directories. But the school census is not 
taken every year ina great many cities, and the directories are not official and at 
the best merely furnish the basis for estimates of doubtful value. 
The following table shows the result of school censuses which appear to have 
been made by actual count and which do not show discrepancies on their face:

  CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS. _ 1508 
In explanation of the blanks in this table, it may be said that some of the cities 
aave no school census, others report the same figures for both years, and in still 
others the differences in numbers are so great as to show palpable error. 
If the school census be correct, the proportion of increase or decrease in the num- 
ber of children may be justly taken to represent approximately the proportion of 
change in total population. Three of these cities therefore appear to have lost 
ground—namely, Omaha, Jersey City,and Philadelphia.' St.Louis may be placed 
in the same category on the evidence already presented. Louisville, Kansas City, 
Newark, and Milwaukee remain practically unchanged from the previous year, 
though with slight gains. The growth of Indianapolis, Detroit, Brooklyn, and 
Cleveland was far below the normal for those cities, respectively. Only San Fran- 
cisco, Boston, Cincinnati, and Providence—4 cities out of 15—show the accustomed 
increase, according to the figures reported. 
The conclusion is plain, The cities themselves have not grown, and conse- 
quently the schools have not. A number of interesting questions arise in this 
connection, economic as well as educational. To discuss them would lead far 
beyond the limits possible here. 
In matters depending upon the action of school authorities there have been 
increases considerably greater than in attendance and enrollment. The authori- 
ties have done their part better than the patrons, in other words, and provision 
wasmade for pupils who didnot come, For 82,177 additional pupils in attendance, 
134,516 more seats were provided, and 4,290 more teachers were employed. 
The amount spent for supervision and teaching increased nearly 7 per cent, and 
the average amount paid to each person of the teaching force, $638.35, was greater 
than in any previous year; it exceeded the average of 1897-98 by $9.47.2. This 
increase in the wages of teachers has run up the average cost of instruction to 
10.11 centsa day per pupil. In Cheyenne, Wyo., the cost is over 15 cents a day, 
and in Washington, D. C., and in the cities of California the average is nearly as 
high. Oklahoma City and the South Carolina cities, with anaverage of 4.26 cents, 
are the lowest in the list. 
Female teachers continue to supplant men; their increase in numbers this year 
amounted to 5.52 per cent, while the male teachers increased 4.96 per cent. Of 
82,650 teachers in city schools, only 6,302 ‘are men, and the high schools have the 
greater part of them. Women are also rapidly gaining ground in the supervising 
positions, and now hold nearly as many of them as men do. Of 161 new places of 
this kind during the last year, 157 were given to women. There are not many 
women superintendents yet, but they are in the decided majority as supervisors 
of special branches and of primary schools. 
In buildings the tendency is toward larger, more durable, and more expensive 
structures, The average size has varied but little in the last eight years. Though 
a great many very large buildings have been erected, the number of small ones 
necessary has been sufficient to keep the average of capacity below 400, It has 
always been a serious problem how to provide for the pupils that have become too 
numerous for the existing building in a certain locality, yet not numerous enough 
to justify a new house of the standard size. It has ordinarily been necessary to 
submit to overcrowding for a time, or else to “‘ build for the future” and have a 
new building only partly filled for two or three years. Milwaukee and St. Louis 
have dealt with the problem ina satisfactory manner by the use of temporary 
wooden structures that are said to serve their purpose admirably. They are 
described in another chapter of this Report. 
The greater cost of modern construction and the advancing values of city real 
  
1 In Philadelphia the census of 1899 was taken during thesummer months, and Superintendent 
Brooks thinks tho decrease may have been duo to that fact.

  INSTITUTIONS FOR HIGHER EDUCATION. 1561 
THE DEGREE OF ASSOCIATE, 
During the year 1898-99 the trustees of the University of Chicago voted to con- 
fer the title or degree of Associate upon those students who finish the work of the 
junior colleges (freshmen and sophomore years). The reasons which led to this 
action are stated as follows in the president’s report for 1898-99: 
From the point of view of the student, the following considerations have had 
influence in determining this action: (1) The fact, very generally recognized, that 
no important step is taken at the end of the preparatory course. The work of the 
freshman and sophomore years in most colleges differs little in content and in 
method from that of the last year of the academy or high school, except that it 
is somewhat more advanced; but, on the other hand, (2) at the end of the sopho- 
more year a most important change occurs according to the organization of the 
larger number of institutions, for it is at this point that the student is given larger 
liberty of choice, and at the same time higher methods of instruction are employed. 
For the last two years of college work the university spirit and the university 
method prevail. A new era in the work of the student has begun. (3) It is evi- 
dent that many students continue work in the junior and senior years of college 
life whose best interests would have been served by withdrawal from college. 
Many continue to the end, not from choice, but rather from compulsion, because 
of the disgrace which may attend an unfinished course. If it were regarded as 
respectable to stop at the close of the sophomore year, many would avail them- 
‘selves of the opportunity. (4) Many students who might be courageous enough 
to undertake a two years’ college course are not able, for lack of funds or for other 
reasons, to see their way clear to enter upon a four years’course. Many, still fur- 
ther, feel that if a professional course is to be taken, there is not time for a four 
years’ college course. It is for this reason that, in part, our professional schools 
are made up £0 largely of noncollege students. If a student who had in view ulti- 
mately the medical or legal or pedagogical profession could make provisions to 
finish a course of study at the end of two years, he would be much more likely to 
undertake such a course than the longer four years’ course, (5) On the other 
hand, many students who are thus led to take a two years’ course would be 
induced at the end of that time to continue to the end of the fourth year, and in 
this way many students of the very highest character, at all events, would be 
enabled to take the entire college course by whom, under the present arrange- 
ments, such a course would be regarded as impracticable, 
From the point of view of the student the following points have been consid- 
ered: (1) Many academies are able to do, at least in part, the work of the freshman 
and sophomore years. The high schools in some States are ready to do such work, 
and in at least one State the university of the State recognizes the work of the 
freshman year when performed in approyed h‘gh schools. (2) Itcan not be denied 
that until young men or young women have shown some maturity of character it 
is wise that they should not be sent very far away from home. If, now, the acad- 
emies and high schools could so perfect their work that freshman and sophomore 
courses might be offered. many young people would be enabled to pursue their 
education at least to this higher point. (3) A large number of so-called colleges, 
which have not sufficient endowment to enable them properly to do the work of the 
junior and senior years, should limit their work to that of the freshman and sopho- 
more years. In many cases the officers of these colleges recognize most keenly 
that they are not doing justice to the students in the higher classes. In reality 
they are defrauding the students who pay their fees in lower classes in order to 
obtain a meager sum of money with which to provide an entirely inadequate course 
of*instruction for the higher class of men. These institutions, in many cases, 
would be disposed to limit their work to the lower field if it were made possi- 
ble for them to doso. They find it necessary, however, to give a degree. If they 
could follow the example of a large institution and give an appropriate recogni- 
tion of the work of the lower years, they would be ready to adopt such an arrange- 
ment. (4) It is a general law of educational work that in seeking a college 
students rarely go farther away from home than 100 miles. Ninety per cent of 
all the students in American colleges are to be found in colleges which are within 
160 miles of home. Ifa fair proportion of these institutions were to limit them- 
selves to the work of the freshman and sophomore years, at the end of this time 
the students who had finished this work and desired to continue would be com- 
pelled to go away from home to some distant institution, perhaps a large univer- 
sity, in which library and laboratory facilities might be found, which would make 
possible the doing of good work. If, on the one hand, the academies and high 
schools were elevated, and if, on the other hand, the scope of work done by many  
-P-A-G-E-322
  1562 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
colleges were limited and, as.a result, institutions developed which would do that 
work thoroughly, there would come to be a recognized distinction between college 
and university which does not now exist. 
In order, therefore, to encourage a movement in the direction thus mentioned, 
the proposed degree has been established. It is believed that the results will be 
fivefold: (1) Many students will find it convenient to give up college work at the 
end of the sophomore year; (2) many students who would not otherwise do so will 
undertake at least two years of college work; (3) the professional schools will be 
able to raise their standards for admission, and in any case many who desire a pro- 
fessional education will take the first two years of the college work; (4) many 
academies and high schools will be encouraged to develop higher work; (5) many 
colleges which have not the means to do the work of the junior and senior years 
will be satisfied under this arrangement to do the lower work. 
RATIO OF STUDENTS TO POPULATION, 1872-1899. 
The following tabular statement, giving the number of students in higher educa- 
tion to each 1,000,000 persons in the United States from 1872 to 1899, shows a 
very substantial increase for each class of students represented, As would 
naturally be expected, by far the greatest increase is shown in the column devoted 
to graduate students, the ratio having increased from 5 students in 1872 to 74 in 
1899, Tho first column of students includes all undergraduate, collegiate, and 
technical students in universities and colleges for men and for both sexes, in col- - 
leges for women, Division A, and in schoo's of technology:

The 3825 degrees conferred for work done were granted by 48 different institu- 
tions in 21 States. A number of the institutions included in the foregoing list and 
conferring the Ph. D. degree do not provide instruction leading to that degree, but 
allow students to pursue the prescribed courses in absentia and to pass examina- 
tions at their homes under the supervision of a sentinel. With the exception of 
the institutions offering nonresident courses of study the general requirements for 
the Ph. D. degree may be stated as follows: 
1. The candidate must have a bachelor’s degree from a reputable college or uni. 
versity or must show that he has pursued a course of study equivalent to that for 
which the bache!or’s degree is conferred. Each institution determines for itself as 
to the fitness of the candidate to become an applicant for the degree. 
2. A knowledge of French and German sufficient for purposes of investigation. 
A reading knowledge of these languages is generally deemed to meet the require- 
ments. 
3. The pursuit of advanced study and research at some acceptable institution 
for not less than two years (in most cases not less than three years), the last of 
which must be spent in residence at the institution by which the degree is to be 
conferred, 
4, The studies pursued must consist of one major or principal subject and, as a 
rule, two minor or subsidiary subjects. 
5. A thesis upon some approved subject connected with the major or principal 
subject, which must give evidence of the candidate’s ability to do original work, 
must be a contribution to human knowledge and must be accepted by the faculty. 
Some of the institutions require the thesis to be printed (or its printing guaran- 
teed) before the degree can be conferred. 
6. Examinations in all the studies pursued by the candidate. 
7. The degree is given not for the mere reason of faithful study for a prescribed 
time or in fulfillment of a determinate programme, nor for miscellaneous studies,     
      
Co ee

  1566 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
but on the ground of long study and high attainment in a special branch of 
learning. 
While the foregoing may be stated as the general requirements for the Ph. D, 
degree, there are, of course, some exceptions thereto. In the following pages are 
given the requirements (omitting minor details) for the degree as shown by the 
catalogues of 72 institutions. The requirements are not given in as detailed form 
as they appear in the catalogues, but have been condensed as much as possib’e. 
University of California, Berkeley, Cal.—A candidate for the degree of doctor 
of philosophy must hold a bachelor’s degree from one of the colleges of general 
culture of this university, or must have pursued successfully a course of study 
equivalent to that represented by such a degree. A knowledge of Latin equal to 
that admitting to the college of letters of this university, and a reading knowledge 
of French and German will be insisted on in all cases. A course of study must 
be selected by the applicant and approved by the graduate council, embracing one 
principal and two subsidiary subjects, and extending over a period of at least 
three years, one of which ordinarily must be spent in continuous residence at 
this university; but in cases where continuous residence is impossible, the course 
of study must be extended to four years, and the separate periods of residence 
must together amount to three academic half years. A thesis bearing on the 
principal subject of the course, and of such a character as to show power to prose- 
cute independent investigation, must be presented to the graduate council for 
approval at least three months previous to the final examination for the degree. 
Special emphasis will be laid upon this last requirement, and the degree will in no 
case be given merely for the faithful completion of a course of study however 
extensive. 
The division of time, study, and research among the principal and subsidiary 
subjects must be approved by the subcommittee in charge of the student; but, 
ordinarily, at least a fourth of the candidate’s work should be given to each one 
of the subsidiary subjects. 
Every candidate must present a detailed written report, signed by the instruct- 
ors, of the studies actually pursued during the year, and must furnish evidence 
that the work has been of proper quality and scope. 
The degree will not be conferred until the candidate has passed before the sub- 
committee in charge a special examination, public and oral, upon the studies 
pursued, and thereby shown distinguished attainments in the principal subject. 
One hundred and fifty copies of each accepted thesis must be deposited in the 
university library. (Register, 1898-99.) 
Leland Stanford Junior University, Stanford University, Cal.—The degree of 
doctor of philosophy is conferred upon graduates of this university, and upon 
others who have had an equivalent training elsewhere, on the satisfactory comple- 
tion of at least three years of graduate work beyond the baccalaureate require- 
ments of the department in which the degree is sought, under the following 
conditions: 
The degree is given only on the ground of advanced scholarship and the ability 
to do independent work in some special line, and not for merely faithful study for 
a prescribed time or course, nor for miscellaneous study. Three years represent 
the minimum time in which the degree can be obtained, and often a longer period 
of study will be necessary. 
Graduate work done elsewhere may be accepted in place of resident study in 
this university; but in no case will private study without sufficient guidance, or 
pursued at a distance from libraries or laboratories or other necessary facilities, 
be accepted as an equivalent, and no degree will be granted to any person who has 
not spent at least the last year of such study in residence at this university. 
The course of study shall embrace one major subject and one or two minors in 
related departments. The minorsubject or subjects shallrepresent approximately 
one-third of the course of study, except that such minor subjects may be waived. 
on the recommendation of the department in which the major subject is taken 
and with the approval of the faculty, whenever the general preparation or special 
needs of the candidate make such a course seem desirable. 
The candidate must present a thesis of such a character as shall display power 
of original andindependent investigation and constitute an actual contribution to 
knowledge. He must guarantee the printing of tho thesis within one year after 
the degree is conferred, and must deposit 100 copies in the university library. 
The candidate must sustain such final examinationsin major and minor subjects 
as may beprescribed by the departments in which studies are taken, and also shall  
-P-A-G-E-327
  
  INSTITUTIONS FOR HIGHER EDUCATION. 1567 
submit to: suck: test or examinations as may be required by the special committee 
of the faculty. 
In addition to the foregoing conditions, the special committee of the faculty 
will, in general, insist upon the following conditions: (a) That all candidates be 
required toshow a reading knowledge of French and German; (b) that, whenever 
practicable, the departmental examinations, in both major and minor subjects, 
be written, the papers of candidates to be submitted to the special committee prior 
to the day fixed for the final test before that committee; (c) that examinations in 
minors be held not earlier than the second semester before the time named for 
conferring the degree. (Register, 1898-99.) 
University of Colorado, Boulder, Colo.—For the degree of doctor of philosophy 
the work assigned shall be estimated at the rate of at least 12 full courses of uni- 
versity work or the equivalent, of which 6 full courses or the equivalent shall. be 
devoted to the major subject, and the remaining 6 courses shall be divided equally 
between the 2 minor subjects, Additional work may ke assigned when lack of 
previous preparation in any selected subject is indicated. 
The criterion of merit is the thesis, which must embody the results of original 
investigation. The degree is not conferred for mere faithtulness in the acquisition 
of knowledge; there must also be the power of scientific production. Hence the 
doctor’s dissertation is to be a new contribution to some field of knowledge, and 
in general will require about one year in the preparation. The thesis must be 
approved before the final examination is taken. I? the candidate shall have sus- 
tained himself in his examinations, the dissertatiow shall be printed by the candi- 
date, and 150° copies shall be delivered to the university library. 
Theminimum time of resident study for the doctor’s degree is three years. Can- 
didates must give evidence of a reading knowledge of French and German, 
(Catalogue, 1898-99. ) 
University of Denver, University Park, Colo.—At least one year’s actual attend- 
ance at the university will be required of candidates for the degree of doctor of 
philosophy. The rest of the work may be done in absentia. A satisfactory thesis 
is required from each candidate. (Yearbook, 1897-98.) 
Yale University, New Haven, Conn.—Graduates of this and other colleges and. 
universities and (im exceptional cases: by special permission) other persons of lib- 
eral education, who areat least. 18 years old,are received asstudents, Thedegree: 
of doctor of philosophy is conferred upon those students who show the results of 
resident graduate work by a thesis giving evidence of high attainmentand power 
of investigation, and by an examination on studies: whose grade and amount meet 
the approval ef the faculty. Under ordinary circumstances two or more years’ 
work in residence will be required, but in exceptional cases work of equal grade 
at another university may take the place of a year’s residence here. ‘The thesis 
must be deposited at the library for public inspection not later than May 1. A 
good knowledge of Latin, German, and French is: required in all cases, unless, for 
some very exceptional reasons, the candidate be excused by the faculty. (Cata- 
logue, 1899-1900. ) 
Catholic University of America, Washington, D. C,—Candidates must— 
1. Spend at least three years in resident study subsequent to taking the bacca- 
laureate degree. 
2. Fulfill the requirements in a major subject and in two subordinate subjects. 
8. Present a dissertation embodying the results of an original investigation. 
4, Pass written and oral examinations in his major and minor subjects. 
5, Make formal application for the degree at least one-academic year in advance: 
of the date at which they expect to present themselves for examination and must, 
at the time of making such application, prove their ability to read French and 
German. (Yearbook, 1899-1900.) 
Columbian University, Washington, D. C.—Personsholding the degree: of M.S., 
M. A.,or their equivalent from: institutions of repute are qualified to offer them- 
selves as candidates for the degree of doctor of philosophy... Candidates shall offer 
themselves in three topics for advanced study—one major and two collateral 
minor subjects. Before being admitted as candidates they shall pass satisfactory 
examinations in French and German.

University of Illinois, Champaign, Ill.—The degree of doctor of philosophy, or 
doctor of science, may be conferred upon any member of the graduate school of 
not less than three years’ standing who shall have reached high attainments in 
scholarship, including a sufficient knowledge of the Latin, French, and German 
languages to serve the purposes of research in his principal specialty, who shall 
have shown marked ability in some line of literary or scientific investigation, and

but is specially searching upon that on which the major work has been done. If 
the thesis is approved, the candidate must have it printed and must deposit not 
less than 100 copies with the librarian of the university. (Catalogue, 1898-99.) 
University of Chicago, Chicago, Iil,—Any member of the graduate schools who has 
been in attendance one quarter or more, whose undergraduate course is equivalent

to that required for a bachelor’s degree in the University of Chicago, whose thesis. 
subject has been accepted by the principal department, and who has a reading 
knowledge of French and German (which must be certified by the heads of those. 
departments), may, on recommendation by the principal department in which he 
wishes to work, be enrolled, by vote of the faculties of the graduate schools, as a 
candidate for the doctor’s degree. 
Students thus accepted as candidates will be given the doctor's degree on the 
fulfiliment of the following requirements: (a) At least three years of resident 
study at the university in pursuance of an accepted course of study; (b) a satis- 
factory final examination upon the work done in preparation for the degree; (cy 
the presentation of a satisfactory printed thesis upon a subject which has been 
approved by the head of the department in which the principal part of the candi- 
date’s work has been done; (d) a good command of literary expression and such 
knowledge of subjects considered fundamental as may be prescribed by the several 
departments; (e) candidates for the degree of doctor of philosophy may not take- 
more than two-thirds of their work in one department, and may not take work 
which is to count toward the degree in more than three departments. 
Graduate work done in another university will be accepted as resident work ir 
the University of Chicago, provided that (a) the institution in which the work was 
done is of high standing, and (b) sufficient evidence is furnished that the particu- 
lar work was satisfactorily performed. Work done in other universities will not 
ordinarily count for more than one and one-half years of resident work in the 
university; but the degree of doctor of philosophy may in exceptional cases be- 
granted after one year of residence. 
From candidates for a doctor's degree the university accepts substitutes to a 
limited extent for the specified work required for the bachelor’s degree in the uni- 
versity. 
In the graduate schools of the university nonresident work may be substituted 
for resident work under the following conditions: (a) The nonresident student is 
expected to matriculate at the university and to spend the first year of the time 
required for the degree in residence, unless he is able to satisfy the head of the 
department in which his principal work is to be done that he can do the introduc- 
tory work in a satisfactory manner when not in attendance; (b) the nonresident 
work shall be performed under the general direction of the head of the depart- 
ment; (c) the final examination in all work leading to the degree shall be passed 
at the university; (¢) nonresident work will be accepted for only one-third of the- 
work required for a degree; (e) a much longer period of time is usually required 
to accomplish a given amount of work when a student is not in residence than 
when in residence. (Register, 1898-99.) 
Northwestern University, Evanston, Ill.—The degree of doctor of philosophy. 
will be conferred under the following conditions: 
1. The candidate must have received the bachelor’s degree from this institution 
or from some other of accepted standing, 
2. The degree may be conferred on successful candidates after three years of 
graduate study, of which at least two must be in residence. The last year or the 
first two years of the three required must be spent in residence at this university. 
The period of three years may, however, be shortened in the case of students who, 
as undergraduates, have pursued special studies beyond the requirement for major 
work in the direction of their proposed graduate work. Study for any specified 
time will not be regarded as sufficient ground for conferring the degree. High 
attainments in scholarship and evidence of original investigation will be expected. 
3. Two thirds of the candidate's time must be given to advanced work in some 
one department which shall constitute his primary subject. The remaining time 
must be given to either one or two secondary subjects. The requirement, 
“advanced work,” will imply an amount of preliminary study in the given subject 
equivalent to at least the undergraduate ‘‘major work” of the department con- 
cerned. ; 
A reading knowledge of French and German, as a preliminary qualification, 
will be required of all candidates. In exceptional cases an equivalent in Latin, 
Greek, or Hebrew may be accepted instead of French. 
4, Every candidate must present a thesis upon an approved topic pertaining to... 
his primary subject. The thesis must give evidence of original investigation. If 
the thesis is approved, the candidate must, within such timeas shall be designated, 
present 25 printed copies of the thesis to the university library. The final exami- 
nation will be both written and oral and will cover the entire primary subject, 
including the topic of the thesis, 
Each branch of the secondary subject may be completed whenever the candidate , 
shall pass a satisfactory written examination upon it.

persons who have received a bachelor’s degree; but no person will be accepted as 
a candidate who has not a knowledge of French and German sufficient for pur- 
poses of research. It is not intended that the degree shall be won merely by faith- 
ful and industrious work for a prescribed time in some assigned course of study, 
and no definite term of required residence can be specified. Asa rule, three years 
of graduate study will be necessary, the last two semesters of which must be 
spent at this university. A candidate for a doctor's degree must take a major 
study that is substantially coextensive with some one department of instruction 
in the university. He must also take two minor studies, one of which may be in 
the same departinent as the major, but involving a more thorough treatment of 
the same. Both minors must be cognate to the major. The thesis must exhibit 
creditable literary workmanship and a good command of the resources of expres- 
sion; but it must depend for acceptance more upon its subject-matter than upon 
its formal or rhetorical qualities, and must be an original contribution to scholar- 
ship or scientific knowledge. It must be read and defended in public, and if 
finally accepted the candidate must cause it to be printed and present 25 copies 
thereof to the university library. The final examination for a degree is conducted 
under the direction of the committee in charge of the student's work. (Calendar, 
1898-99. ) 
University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minn.—The Ph. D. degree will be con- 
ferred on bachelors of this or any other reputable college or university within not 
less than three years after graduation therefrom under the following conditions: 
The candidate shall elect work in three distinct departments, a major subject in 
one department and two minor subjects in other departments. Within the major 
subject the candidate shall choose a special field. ‘The work included in a minor 
shall be equivalent to at least one year’s work in one subject. 
The candidate shall evince on his final examination an exhaustive knowledge of 
the special field selected, and shall show such acquaintance with the other studies 
of the major subject and with the minor subjects as the faculty may require. 
A committee, consisting of the heads of departments in which the candidate’s 
subjects fall, shall have the direction of his work. 
The candidate shall present a thesis on some subject connected with his special 
field of work, which thesis shall be the result of original investigation by the can- 
didate and shall be a contribution to knowledge. 
Candidates shall ordinarily be required to devote three full years of graduate 
study to preparation for the final examination, They shall be in actual residence 
at the university and shall pursue their studies therein at least two years; they 
may, however, offer in lieu of one of these two years an equivalent term of resi- 
dent graduate work in some other institution, it being always required that they 
be in residence at the university the year next preceding the final examination.

  CHAPTER XXXVIIZ. 
PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS. 
The number of theological students enrolled during the year 1898-99 was 8,261, 
a decrease of 110 since the previous year. During the last four years there has 
been an increase of only 211 in the number of theological students, or less than 3 
per cent. During the same time the increase in the number of law students was 
nearly 33 per cent. The number of students in law was always less than the 
number in theology until the year 1894-95, but since that time the number of law 
students has increased rapidly. 
The number of medical students enrolled was 23,778, an increase of 845 over the 
previous year, the students in regular schools numbering 21,401; in homeopathic 
schools, 1,802; in others, 575. All of the medical schools which give full courses of 
instruction report that they have courses of four years except 15 schools, and some 
of these are preparing to enter upon courses of four years. In 43 schools the an- 
nual session continues eight months or longer, 12 of these schools having sessions 
of nine months, In several medical schools the time of attendance now required 
in one year is equal to the whole time of attendance required for a degree twenty 
years ago. 
Dental students numbered 7,354, an increase of 580, while students in pharmacy 
numbered 3,551. 
During the ten years from 1889 to 1899 the number of students in theology in- 
creased 18 per cent; in pharmacy, 26 per cent; in homeopathic medicine, 55 per cent; 
in regular medicine, 75 per cent; in law, 204 percent; and in dentistry, 301 per cent.

Increase in the number of dental students.—A diagram is given (p. 1679) showing 
the rapid increase in number of dental students in the United States as compared 
with the number in other professions. In the report of the provost of the Uni- 
versity of Pennsylvania this increase is mentioned, as weil as the proposed methods 
of limiting admissions, and it is given as the opinion of the dean of the dental 
school that a course of four years in dentistry must beadopted. The provostsays: 
Only two years have elapsed since the completion of the new building for this 
department. When the plans for this building were studied, it was proposed to 
provide for instruction fora maximum number of 500 men. At the end of the 
jirst year the maximum capacity of the school had been reached. 
Three methods of limiting admissions are mentioned: 
They involve higher entrance requirements, or the increase of the fee—now a 
very moderate one—or both. * * * Itis the view of the dean that the curric- 
ulum of the school is at present too full to be fairly covered within three years; 
and that as all of the branches of study which are recognized a3 fundamental to 
the study of general medicine are fundamental subjects in dentistry, the dental 
curriculum must be so enlarged as to include such subjects. The only solution of 
this aim would be the establishment of a four years’ course. 
A literary degree required for admission to a law school.—At a meeting of the 
trustees of Columbia University, New York, held January 9, 1899, it was— 
Resolved, That on and after June 80, 1903, admission to the law schoo! be limited 
to students who have already taken their first degree.

THE HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL, 
The report of the president of Harvard University for 1898-99 mentions several 
gifts or bequests in which the medical school is either interested directly or is 
aided in the full accomplishment of its purposes. From the estate of Mrs. Caro-

line Brewer Croft was received a bequest of $100,000, less $7,975, the amount of 
the legacy taxes paid in England. The income is to be used in researches for the 
cure of cancer and other similar diseases, 
Mr, James Stillman, of New York City, gave to the corporation $100,000 where- 
with to build an infirmary and purchase the land necessary therefor. 
An interesting endowment came into the possession of the corporation from an 
anonymous source at the end of January, 1899. Its object was the establishment 
of a professorship of hygiene for the benefit of the students of Harvard College. 
The gift amounted to nearly $156,000; but the whole income of this fund is not yet 
available. The object of the giver is to provide the students of Harvard College 
with a medical friend competent to give them the best advice, winning in his 
nature, and devoting himself chiefly to the physical and moral welfare of the 
undergraduates at Cambridge. * * * 
The corporation also determined on another large use of the Pierce bequest— 
namely, for the promotion of instruction in comparative medicine—but in three 
separate sums; $100,000 as the foundation of a new professorship to bear his name, 
$100,000 for a medical laboratory building to bear his nume, and $100,000 as an 
endowment for the laboratory.

The Calvin Ellis bequest to Harvard medical school.'—It has recently been made 
known that the estate of the late Calvin Ellis has become available for medical 
purposes. The estate amounts to nearly $400,000, and by the wish of the testator 
its income is to be devoted to the advancement of the departments of anatomy, 
physiology, and pathology at the Harvard medical school. Dr, Ellis was at one 
time dean of the Harvard medical school, and for many years one of its most dis- 
tinguished clinical professors, He felt what others have also felt but been unable 
to express materially, that teachers of nonclinical subjects do not receive a just

reward for their services. The first provision of his bequest therefore was that 
the professors of the several departments mentioned be paid $5,000 a year, which 
had already been done, and then the income remaining be made available for the 
development of the three fundamental branches ‘of medicine—anatomy, physi- 
ology, and pathology. e 
Could the benefactor have foreseen the exact lines in which medicine was des- 
tined to develop he cou!d not have given more wisely, for the great need of the 
present, and it will be a constantly increasing need as time goes on, is endowment 
for the maintenance and growth of laboratories and the cultivation of research, 
which the existence of such laboratories implies i i 
coud have fully realized the enthusiasm for resear 
the development of what we popularly call ‘‘scientific medicine,” though it had 
already begun during the later years of his life. Be that as it may, the bequest 
is a most notable one, coming as it does from a man who, although himself per- 
sonally interested.in the clinical side of medicine, yet had the breadth of vision to 
see that the future needs of medical education would require that which money 
alone can give in the development of its more theoretic aspects. In President 
Eliot’s words when the announcement was made, ‘‘Could pecuniary resources 
possibly be more timely, and could there be a more delightful benefactor of the 
advancement of medical science than Calvin Ellis?”

No mention is made in the statement of traveling expenses in going to and from 
the student’s home, an item of considerable importance to many students. In 
most schools, too, there is an examination or diploma fee of $25 or $30. 
ln the medical department of the University of Michigan,! located at Ann Arbor, 
“the totalamountof fees paid to the university during the whole four years’ course, 
for matriculation, incidental expenses, material used, and diploma, is for Michi- 
gan students about $3090, and for others about $355.” ‘‘Students obtain board and 
lodging in private families at from three to five dollars a week.” 
In the announcement for 1899-1900 of the medical department of the University 
of Iowa, located at Lowa City, the necessary yearly expenses are given as follows:

AGE OF GRADUATES IN MEDICINE, 
The dean of the medical school of the University of Pennsylvania (Dr. John 
Marshall) comments on the length of time required for completion of a medical 
course: 
The average age of those members of the class possessing collegiate degrees was 
22.6. Adding four years, which is the duration of the course in medicine, the 
age would be brought up to 26.6 years, and assuming that after graduation the

  PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS. 1681 
graduate should spend at least a year or longer as resident physician in a hospital, 
the age would be brought up to at least 27.6, or practically 28 years. This, itseems 
to me, unduly defers the time when a man should begin his professional career. 
Three remedies have suggested themselves to me: 
First. That the colleges granting academic degrees decrease their requirements 
for eauesiOn, so that students may begin their studies in college at an earlier 
age in life; or, 
Second. Complete the college course for an academic degree in three years, and 
confer the degree at the end of three years; or 
Third. Let colleges which grant academic degrees arrange so that astudent who 
purposes studying medicine and who has spent the freshman, sophomore, and 
junior years in the college, may enter an approved medical school, and at the end 
of the course in medicine, when the candidate shall have received his degree in 
medicine, he be grantéd the bachelor’s degree by the college in which he pursued 
his academic studies. In support of the suggestion that the collegiate course of 
those students who propose pursuing professional studies be limited to three 
years, I may cite the practice in Germany, where the certiticate (zeugniss) of a 
gymnasium, which may be considered as certifying that the holder had pursued 
courses of study about equivalent to the first three years of the course in arts in 
an American college of standing, is accepted as evidence of the possessor having 
pursued a course of study to warrant his beginuing courses of professional study 
leading to a degree in any university in Germany. 
The president of Harvard says in his report for 1898-99, p. 10: 
The common attainment of the degree of bachelor of arts in three years is cer- 
tainly approaching. No specific legislation -will be needed to accomplish this 
important change, for any young man of fair abilities can now procure the degree 
in three years without hurry or overworkif he wishes to dosoorif his parents wish 
tohave him. That this wish is felt by an increasing number of students and par- 
ents is demonstrated in the table repeated from the report of last year. In eight 
years the proportion of the graduates of the year who were credited in three years 
with sixteen or more courses (the number necessary for the degree in Harvard) has 
risen from less than one-fourth of the whole number to very nearly two-fifths. 
The president of Columbia University, New York, says:! 
The privilege of shortening the combined college and professional course by 
counting the first year in the professional schools as a partial fulfillment of the 
requirement for the bachelor of arts degree is not open to students who enter 
Columbia College later than the beginning of the junior year. 
The New York Medical Record of March 10, 1900, says: 
In response to an appeal by college presidents to admit to the second year of the 
medical course graduates qualified in the branches taught in the first year of the 
course, the Pennsylvania State Medical Council adopted the following resolution: 
‘Resolved, That in the judgment of the council, when the medical course of a 
literary college, as proven by the examination of the student by the medical col- 
lege, covers the entire work of the first year of actual medical study, such course 
ee be accredited by the medical college as the first year of medical study required 
yy law.” 
FRAUDULENT DIPLOMAS, 
The Journal of the American Medical Association, October, 1899, says: 
The supreme court of Illinois, on the 16th instant, revoked the charter of the 
Independent Medical College of Chicago. After obtaining further proof cf the 
wholesale sale of diplomas by this institution, the attorney-general brought suit 
in the circuit court of Cook County to have the charter of the ‘‘college” revoked. 
After hearing the evidence the court, on February 15, 1899, entered a judgment 
of ouster, The “faculty” of the college made no defense, but took an appeal to 
the supreme court simply to gain time. The decree of the circuit court has not 
apparently interfered with the sale of diplomas. Indeed, the ‘‘faculty ” has ear- 
nestly endeavored to confer as many degrees as possible, and so ‘‘lowered the 
scale of prices” and gave degrees for practice in Michigan, Kansas, Texas, and 
elsewhere to all who applied and paid. The sale has continued to the present. 
Early in the month the State board of health purchased one in Fort Worth, Tex., 
for $20, The transaction, however, was arranged in Champaign, Ill., through a

licensed physician, whom the board has since summoned to appear and show cause 
why his certificate should not be revoked for unprofessional and dishonorable con- 
duct, The ‘‘physician” in this case, whom the college required to ‘show eyi- 
dence of qualifications,” was a young law student, of whom the sole requirement 
demanded was a tender of the necessary fee in advance. Recently the “faculty” 
began to seo ahead the parting of the ways, and in August the institution became 
affiliated with the Metropolitan Medical College, another legally chartered med- 
ical college, the charter being issued by the secretary of state under the provisions 
of the act of 1872. * * * 
Under the provisions of a statute which became in force July 1, 1899, the attor- 
ney-general may file a bill in chancery in the name of the people of the State of 
illinois against any corporation authorized to confer degrees, diplomas, or other 
certificates of qualifications in the science of medicine, pharmacy, or dentistry 
which conducts a fraudulent business, or abuses, misuses, or violates the terms of 
its charter, in any court having jurisdiction of the corporation and subject-matter 
of such biil, for an injunction to restrain said corporation from conducting its 
business fraudulently or abusing, misusing, or violating the terms of its charter, 
and also for the dissolution of said corporation, ‘‘and thereupon it shall be the 
duty of the court in which said bill is filed to grant such injunction and to hear 
and determine the same asin other cases in chancery. And provided further, that 
this act shall apply to schools, colleges, or universities which now or may here- 
after be licensed in this State, notwithstanding any provisions that may exist 
in their charters.” 
The supreme court had no hesitation in saying that it fully justified the finding 
and judgment of the court below. In fact, it was sufficient to establish the guilt 
of the defendant, as charged in the information, beyond a reasonable doubt, and 
would haye justified not only the forfeiture of the charter, but the infliction of a 
tine on the parties guilty of the abuses. Therefore the judgment of the circuit 
court was affirmed. 
In the same journal, July 8, 1899: 
The business done by the Chicago diploma milis is well illustrated by the fact 
that the county clerk’s official records of physicians in one Michigan town are 
found to include the names of 23 who claim as their alma mater the notorious 
Independent Medical College. This may be an extreme case; the diploma-mill 
graduates may have gravitated for some reason or other especially to that locality, 
but it is certainly suggestive of possibilities elsewhere. 
There are still a few States and Territories in which, according to the wording 
of the law, anyone holding a diploma from “any legally chartered ” school of med- 
icine or dentistry, without regard to the character of its instruction, is allowed to 
practice his profession. It is this that gives value to the diplomas of fraudulent 
but legally chartered schools. 
Tho following notice is taken from the Washington Post of June 5, 1900: 
Chicago, June 4.—Government officers to-day invaded the Metropolitan Medical 
College, an alleged ‘‘ diploma mill,” and arrested its officers. Themenare charged 
with having used the mails to defraud, and it is said their receipts amount to 
many thousands of dollars. They Were taken before United States Commissioner 
Humphrey and the hearing of the charges against them set for June 14. Failing 
to give suitable bonds, all four went to jail. 
The institution with which the defendants are connected is also known as the 
Independent Medical Coliege and the National Law School, and the evidence shows 
that its faculty has been selling degrees for the practice of medicine and law at 
prices ranging from $3 to $200, the compensation being determined by the amount 
the would-be professional men were willing to advance. 
Post-Office Inspector Gould, who made the arrest after accumulating a lot of 
documentary evidence, says the fraud is one of the largest the postal authorities 
have ever had to deal with, and that the ‘‘ graduates” of the institution are 
practicing in every State, and even abroad. He says frequent complaints of mal- 
practice have been made against the holders of the diplomas of the institution. 
Regular medical colleges and law institutions in all parts of the United States 
have been fighting the officers of the *‘ diploma mill” for several years in vain, and 
up to the time the men were arrested it is said they were ‘‘graduating” their 
subscribers at the rate of a dozen each day. 
Inspector Gould induced a friend to write to the Metropolitan Medical College 
for information. The institution offered to give a full course in medicine and a 
degree for $200, and shorter terms of study for smaller amounts.

PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS. 1683 
Inspector Gould has a bunch of unsigned certificates.of practice for the State of 
Texas, and he says the name of the district clerk is forged to these for an extra 
compensation. ‘Texas is said to have been the most fertile field for the ‘“‘gradu- 
ates” of the institution. 
The British consul has made repeated efforts to run the Metropolitan faculty 
out of business, as Great Britain is said to have been flooded with their diplomas, 
It is said that dozens of ‘‘ graduates” of theinstitution are practicing in India and 
in all parts of the world. The diplomas bear the names of the whole faculty, but 
two girls declared they were employed to write these on all the degrees issued by 
the college. 
A Texas diploma mill, calling itself the ‘‘New York Medical College,” was 
organized and incorporated last November and has just been permanently closed 
by the State authorities. It appears to have been the project of an enter ‘prising 
firm composed of a man and his wife, who associated with themselves certain 
other individuais—or at least their names—and proceeded to make M. D.’s, after 
the approved Armstrong & Co. method. * 
How many would-be M, D.’s have been “ dsaorated” by this concern in its brief 
but enterprising career is unknown to us, but Texas appears to have been a good 
field for the Chicago bogus diploma dealers. According to an editorial in the 
Texas Medical News, from which journal we take the above facts, there were reg- 
istered in Tarrant County, Texas, alone, 26 diplomas from Chicago's ‘Inde- 
pendent Medical College,” out of a total of 41 in 1898, 115 out of 149 in 1899, besides 
14 from the ‘Metropolitan Medical College”—now in trouble—and 2 from the 
“International Health University.” From January 1 till April 12, 1900, there 
were 29 diplomas registered altogether, and of these 20 were from the Metropolitan 
and 2 from the ‘‘ Independent Medical College.” 1 . 
At the meeting of the National Association of Dental Faculties in 1898 it was— 
Resolved, That the committee on foreign relations be instructed to use its 
utmost diligence i in ferreting out fraudulent or irregular colleges, and the granting 
of degrees irregularly by recognized colleges, should this be. done, and to leave 
undone nothing within their power to bring to justice institutions granting irreg- 
ular degrees or degrees irregularly. 
VETERINARY MEDICINE, 
The provost of the University of Pennsylvania says in his report as to the veteri- 
nary school: 
There appears to be as yet very little public understanding of the importance of 
veterinary science, and without such understanding the necessary public financial 
support is entirely lacking. Veterinary science is usuaily considered as haying 
for its sole object the cure of the diseases of animals. While this is a matter of 
humanitarian and economic value, and one to which most careful attention is and 
should be given, it is by no means of so much importance as some other parts of 
this scjence. The protection and improvement of the domestic animals are factors 
of veterinary work that are of far-reaching importance. * * 
Veterinary science stands between this enormous industry ae epizootic disease, 
The magnitude of the losses occasioned by contagious diseases of animals, and the 
importance of providing thorough training in veterinary science, are illustrated 
by comparatively recent occurrences in England. It is éonservatively estimated 
that the losses caused by epizootics among cattle in Great Britain during the thirty 
years ending in 1870 amounted to at least. $450,584,270 (Fleming), and in 1872 one 
disease alone caused losses amounting to $76,000,000. All of these diseases (lung 
plague, cattle plague, foot and mouth disease) are now under control, and one has 
been completely eradicated. In this country hog cholera has caused losses amount- 
ing to $35,000,000 in one year. Texas fever, by destroying cattle and impeding 
traffic in southern cattle, caused losses that are estimated at $25,000,000 each year. 
Tuberculosis prevails extensively i in the Eastern States, and causes annual losses 
aggregating many millions. Itis believed thatin Pennsylvania diseases that should 
be prevented destroy at least $6,000,000 worth of live stock every year. * * * 
In Germany the breeding interests are aided by experts, most of whom are vet- 
erinarians. ‘This direction and assistance have resulted in many districts in mak- 
ing animals from 25 per cent to 50 per cent more productive and valuable without 
increased cost of production—solely by the application of the teaching of a part 
of veterinary science.

  1748 : EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
IL—NEW BUILDINGS AND CHANGES IN THE COURSE OR IN THE 
METHODS OF INSTRUCTION. 
Alabama Polytechnic Institute, Auburn, Ala.—The last State legislature, on appli- 
cation of the trustees, changed the name of the college to the Alabama Polytechnic 
Institute, thereby showing its comprehensive and general scientific character, 
including not only agriculture and the mechanic arts, but also physics, electricity, 
chemistry, etc., in their varied applications to the industrial arts. Much atten- 
tion is paid to laboratory work on the part of the students. Additions were made 
to the equipment in mechanical and electrical engineering, and a new residence 
for the professor of horticulture was constructed at a cost of $1,950. At presenta 
special chemical laboratory for work in the experiment station is being constructed, 
and the foundry and forge room in the mechanical department is being enlarged, 
(President William Le Roy Broun.) 
Agricultural and Mechanical College for Negroes, Normal, Ala.—One year has 
been added to the normal course, making it four years instead of three years, 
All the literary and industrial courses have been strengthened very materially. 
Sick nursing, cooking, and agriculture have been greatly improved. One of the 
two-story frame mechanic-arts buildings was destroyed by fire January 28, 1899, 
It was occupied by the departments in shoemaking, blacksmithing, carpentry, 
wheelwright, mattress, and bro factory and paint shop. The school being 
unable to restore the building, it was replaced by a brick building paid for by vol- 
untary subscriptions of the teachers of the school. A new brick wing, 40 by 70 
feet, three stories, was added during the year. This contains recitation rooms 
and laboratories on the first and|second floors, and a dormitory for girls on the 
third floor. (President W. H. Councill.) 
University of Arizona, Tucson, Ariz.—The principal change in our course of 
instruction has been the development of manual-training features, including free- 
hand and industrial drawing. The shop has been fitted with power and facilities 
for woodworking, so that we have given courses in carpentry, joinery, wood- 
turning, and inlaying during the year. 
Our requirements for admission have been increased, a fact which tends to lessen 
our patronage. Almost our only sources of supply for our college classes are our 
subcollegiate department and the high schools of the Territory, of which there are 
but few, so that our classes must remain small until our population increases and 
fitting schools multiply. 
While there have been no radical changes to record, the year has shown sub- 
stantial progress in all lines of work. (President M. M. Parker.) 
University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, Ark.—The financial condition of the uni- 
versity is perfectly sound, its educational work vigorous and progressive. The 
department of history and pedagogy have been separated, history made an inde- 
pendent department, and philosophy and pedagogy united, forming also an inde- 
pendent department. The courses of study have been materially modified, 
electives being limited to the junior and senior classes, the courses for the freshman 
and sophmore classes more definitely prescribed, some options, however, allowed 
among related subjects. Greek required for the B, A. degree, and a course, includ- 
ing Latin but not Greek, arranged leading to the degree of B. Ph. Repairs and 
minor improvements have been made on the buildings, but no new buildings 
erected. 
By act of the general assembly of Arkansas, approved March 8, 1899, the name 
of the university has been changed from Arkansas Industrial University to the 
University of Arkansas. (President John L. Buchanan.) 
University of California, Berkeley, Cal.—Paid to complete buildings in San 
Francisco for use of the professional departments during last fiscal year, $41,000. 
 
-P-A-G-E-509
  AGRICULTURAL AND MECHANICAL COLLEGES. 1749 
The college of commerce began instruction, and instruction in the new depart- 
mentof geography was begun by Prof. George Davidson. Instructionin Cantonese 
Chinese was provided by the addition of Dr. John E. Gardner to the staff of the 
department of oriental languages and literatures. (President Benjamin Ide 
Wheeler.) "i 
Delaware College, Newark, Del.—No changes in the courses of study have been 
made during the year except to effect a better correlation of work, through sev- 
eral transpositions of subjects, and to enlarge somewhat the freedom of election in 
the junior and senior years of some courses. The library and reading room, 
opened in September, 1896, at once began to tell upon the instruction in the 
departments of English language, history, and economics. The library is steadily 
growing and is exercising an increasing influence upon the work of the college. 
(President George A. Harter.) 
Florida Agricultural College, Lake City, Fla.—Requirements for admission to 
the freshman class have been raised by the introduction of elementary botany, 
elementary physics, and concrete geometry into the preparatory course. The new 
catalogue outlines for the next year an entirely new course of study, in which 
agricultural subjects are to receive greater. attention and be obligatory on fresh- 
man and sophomore classes. (President W. F. Yocum.) 
Florida State Normal and Industrial College, Tallahassee, Fla.—In the session of 
1897-98, owing to the increasing numbers.in the boys’ hall, the board of trustees 
set aside $800 out of the State appropriation for the year to add an extension to 
that building. An addition of two stories, 32 by 50 feet, containing 16 rooms, each 
103 by 104 feet, was projected. The boys of the mechanical department, 14 in 
number, working for seven months at an average of two and two-thirds hours a 
day, after the close of the literary work, under the superintendence of their 
instructor, erected this building, which is quite an evidence of the brightness and 
efficiency of the young men, especially when it is noted that most of them had 
never handled a carpenter’s tool until after entering this institution; this comes 
in as practice work. Had the building been erected by contractors it would have 
cost the State at least $1,800. During the past summer the girls’ hall has been 
completed by the construction of the west wing at an expense of nearly $4,000 
from the State appropriation of the present year. The finished building is 122 
feet in length; the east wing is 20 by 54 feet; the west wing, 20 by 90 feet, and the 
main body is 86 by 80 feet. (President T. D. Tucker.) 
Georgia State College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, Athens, Gia.—The con- 
dition of the college is good, and its progress for the year has been satisfactory. 
The faculty have given much consideration to systematizing the curricula and, 
courses of instruction, with special view to strengthening and popularizing the 
courses in agriculture. By authority of the board of trustees all degrees given 
by the college have been abolished except one, that of bachelor of science. To 
obtain this degree four courses are offered, each with a certain degree of elasticity 
in the matter of options, and, in the special course, permitting the substitution of 
appropriate technical studies for those in the higher branches of pure science and 
others as follows: (@) General course; (b) civil engineering; (c) electrical engi- 
neering; (d) agriculture. The courses are essentially the same for the freshman 
year, which includes botany, drawing, and elementary agriculture. In each of 
the courses certain fundamental, liberal studies are required, and it is believed 
they are of equal pedagogic value, and also equal in this particular, to the courses 
for bachelor of arts offered in another department of the University. The course 
of instruction offered in the school of agriculture is essentially that proposed by 
the committee of the Association of American Agricultural Colleges and Experi- 
ment Stations. We believe this step will have a vast influence in establishing the 
course of instruction in agriculture in its proper place in the college curriculum,
-P-A-G-E-510
  1750 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99, 
The board of trustees of the university at its lastsession (June, 1899) also author- 
ized the general faculty to require of all students in the university attendance 
upon courses of lectures upon agriculture or topics directly related thereto. (Pres- 
ident H. C. White.) 
University of Idaho, Moscow, Idaho.—We have enlarged the courses of instruc- 
tion in the preparatory department, giving greater emphasis to scientific instruc- 
tion and increasing laboratory facilities for the same. Fifteen additional rooms 
have been finished and furnished in the administration building at a cost of $14,000. 
These rooms are for laboratory and recitation purposes. In addition to these an 
auditorium capable of seating 700 has been finished and furnished. A farmhouse 
has been erected on the experimental farm and a greenhouse on the horticultural 
grounds. (President Joseph P. Blanton.) 
University of Illinois, Champaign, Ill.—The university has enjoyed a year of 
unprecedented prosperity. In the year we completed and occupied a new elec- 
trical building and steam laboratory, and the legislature made an appropriation 
of $150,000 for a new agricultural building. (President A. S. Draper.) 
Purdue University, Lafayette, Ind.—We have made a one-story brick addition 
to our chemical laboratory; erected a substantial wooden pavilion, 30 by 50 feet, 
for lecture purposes, particularly for the use of students in agriculture: a two- 
story piggery, built in accordance with the most improved modern plans; an 
extensive addition to the dairy; remodeled and made a substantial addition to the 
engineer's residence; remodeled the central heating plant, putting in new boilers, 
erecting two new coal houses, etc.; and improved our campus by laying cement 
walks to the extent of over 25,000 feet. In addition to these improvements, we 
have added to our equipment to the extent of about $10,000, making the total cost 
of improvements for the year 1898-99 about $20,000. 
While the total enrollment forthe year was 749, one less than the previous year, the 
number of graduates, 158 (regular four-year courses, 103; pharmacy, 33; advanced 
degrees, 22), was the largest in the history of the university; the freshman class, 
numbering 180, the largest save one, and the number of students taking the short 
course in agriculture was 50 per cent in advance of any previous year. During the 
year 1898-99 there have been published 8 regular station bulletins, 16 newspaper 
bulletins, 1 pamphlet on civil engineering, and an address by Governor Mount on 
“The Need for Higher Education in Agriculture and the Industrial Arts.” The 
professors have delivered about 100 lectures on scientific subjects and 92 farmers’ 
institutes have been held, averaging two days each. (President James H. Smart.) 
Iowa State College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts, Ames, Iowa.—The 
growth of the attendance of students still keeps up. The college year hereafter 
will begin about September first instead of the last of July or first of August. 
We haye fitted up new laboratories for pathology and histology. Our professor 
of zoology is now State entomologist. Our course for young women has been 
strengthened to a course in philosophy and letters and the degree of bachelor of 
philosophy given to the young women of this course instead of the degree of bachelor 
of letters, as hitherto. A number of the prominent buildings have been painted. 
thissummer. Wehave putin 25 shower baths for young men. - We have added two 
new teachers to our department of English and greatly strengthened the quality 
and quantity of the work donein thisdepartment. (President W.M. Beardshear.) 
Kansas State Agricultural College, Manhattan, Kans.—A four-years’ course in 
civil engineering has been established; also a short course of one winter term in 
dairying. In addition to this three other short courses have been prepared to go 
into effect next year. They are respectively a domestic-science course of two 
terms, an agricultural mechanics’ course of two terms, and a horticultural 
mechanics’ course of two terms. The domestic-science course will be given in fall 
terms, the agricultural mechanics’ and the horticultural mechanics’ courses in
-P-A-G-E-511
  
AGRICULTURAL AND MECHANICAL OOLLEGES. 1751 
winter terms. All these short courses are open without examination to students 
of good character and 18 years of age. These courses are highly practical and are 
designed to meet the needs of students who can attend college but a skort term. 
By systematic effort, continued through a considerable portion of the year, the 
college has secured the largest legislative appropriation in its history, amounting 
to $111,600. Of this sum, $25,000 was appropriated to the erection of an agricul- 
tural and dairy building, and $9,000 more to the equipment of this building, the 
purchase of a dairy herd, and the provision of shelter for the herd; $9,000 was 
appropriated to the erection of an addition to the mechanical engineering building, 
while $12,000 more was allowed for equipment and additional boilers, boiler house, 
and engine; $5,200 was appropriated to the college library for completion of room 
and book stacks and for furnishing, heating, and lighting an addition to the library. 
(President Thomas E. Will.) 
Agricultural and Mechanical College of Kentucky, Lexington, Ky.—We may con- 
fidently say that the last year was the most prosperous that the college has ever 
known. The attendance was larger, the college classes consisted in the main of 
good material, and the average numbers maintained were better than in former 
years. 
The greatest improvement is along the engineering lines. The graduates from 
these courses of study find no difficulty in getting remunerative employment of a 
high order. Indeed, their services are not infrequently engaged in advance of 
taking their degrees. Experts who visit our shops and examine our lines of work 
speak uniformly of our good equipment and of the scope and character of work 
done by engineering students, 
In natural science notable advancement has also been made. Our laboratories 
are well equipped for doing good work, and good work is done, 
The removal of the State Geological Museum from Frankfort to Lexington, with 
the inspector of mines and his assistant, has added to the prestige of the college, 
and will by the act of removal establish a school of mines in the year 1900. The 
coal and iron interésts of Kentucky will be materially benefited by a course of 
mining engineering in Kentucky. 
The organization of farmers’ institutes last winter bids fair to bring the facilities 
afforded by the college for agricultural instruction before the farming community. 
These institutes have been liberaily attended by our professors of botany, zoology, 
geology, horticulture, dairying, engineering, and agriculture. We had one or 
two representatives at every institute held. 
In conclusion, we are able to report progress along every line of work. (Presi- 
dent James K, Patterson.) 
State Normal School for Colored Persons, Frankfort, Ky.—We have purchased 
a farm of 265 acres, with a two-story brick dormitory, which we use for the boys’ 
dormitory. This purchase increases the value and interest of our agricultural 
feature very much. The farm cost $16,500. 1t has outbuildings valued at $2,000. 
This year 80 acres are in grass, 40 acres in wheat, 12 acres in rye, 30 acres in corn, 
10 acres in oats, 8 acresin garden. (President James E, Givens.) 
Louisiana Si tversity and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton 
Rouge, La.— ings were erected during the year except a wooden store- 
house for imple 8, tools, etc. A two-story addition to the mechanical work- 
shop, 100 by 80 feet, is now being built. During the session of 1898-99 the course 
in sugar engineering was extended and perfected and full courses in mechanical 
engineering and civil engineering were substituted for the old one course in the 
twocombined. A commercial course of four years has been arranged for the next 
session, (President Thomas D. Boyd.) 
Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, New Orleans, 
La,—There have been no changes in course or methods of instruction during the           
   
-P-A-G-E-512
  1752 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
session, A course in printing and one in bookkeeping and typewriting have been 
added during the past session. A printing press was purchased, with type and all 
necessary accompaniments, and a room was fitted up and a teacher for the same 
was employed. Classes have been taught in both sections during the session. 
The school has just passed through a prosperous session. The total number of 
graduates this session from all the departments of the school was 23—12 from the 
literary and 11 from the industrial. Two of the lowest sections were removed. 
This reduced the total attendance from 443 of last year to 414 this year. We had, 
however, more applications for admission this session than last. Up to date, dur- 
ing thirteen years past, the number of graduations from the school are as follows: 
In the literary department, 100; girls’ industrial, 27; agricultural, 19; mechani- 
cal, 2; making 100 literary and 48 industrial graduates. The agricultural and 
mechanical feature, however, is of more recent date. 
It has been almost impossible to find pupils outside of this school far enough 
advanced to enter the lowest year of the high-school department. We have been 
obliged for years to maintain a grammar school to prepare material for the higher 
grades. The 148 pupils graduated have been brought out, almost without excep- 
tion, from the raw material, most of them very raw. They have been, nearly all, 
through one or all of our grammar grades, The New Orleans public colored 
schools have taken our normal students for teachers about as soon as they grad- 
uated, and have picked out a number of our high-school graduates also. As most 
of these pupils are poor the temptation to secure a position for themselves is too 
great for them to resist. In making a list of our graduates we could not find one 
unemployed. (President H. A. Hill.) 
University of Maine, Orono, Me.—During the year ending June 30, 1899, the 
school of law of the university has been opened with a very encouraging attend- 
ance. Professors of Latin and Greek have been elected in preparation for the 
inauguration of the classical course in the fall of 1899. 
A dormitory for women has been completed at a cost of about $5,000. About 
$6,000 has been spent for the equipment of the departments, the largest amount 
going to the agricultural departments. 
The faculty and number of students are the largest in the history of the uni- 
versity. (President A. W. Harris.) 
Maryland Agricultural College, Collegepark, Md.—All courses have been ma- 
terially advanced, the natural science section particularly. The trend of the 
institution’s work is along the line of more technological work. Morrill Hall has 
been constructed during the past year, at a cost of $12,000. This is devoted to 
agriculture and allied branches. An annex to the main building for sanitary 
purposes has been constructed at a cost of $4,500. University extension work is 
being pushed. Nature studies in the public schools is a feature in which the col- 
lege is much interested. (President R. W. Silvester.) 
Massachusetts Agricultural College, Amherst, Mass.—The elective studies of 
senior year have been grouped according to their proper relations into 11 courses, 
and the courses have been made elective. A wooden buildingewith small dairy 
plant has been erected for the special study of problems in the dairy, at a cost 
of $2,000. A veterinary laboratory and hospital stable have been erected and 
equipped at a cost of $25,000. The buildings are of brick. The walls of the 
laboratories, class rooms, and dissecting pit have the bricks covered with 
white glaze enamel to facilitate disinfection. The buildings are furnished with 
the latest apparatus and labor-saving devices. 
The most notable piece of work has been working out and describing the life 
history of the nematodes affecting very seriously the crops of cucumbers, toma- 
toes, lettuce, etc., grown under glass, and making public a cheap and effective 
remedy for the same. (President Henry H. Goodell.) 
 
-P-A-G-E-513
  AGRICULTURAL AND MECHANICAL COLLEGES. 1753 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston, Mass.—Last year’s report con- 
tained a brief description of the new building named in honor of Henry L. Pierce, 
which since then has been practically finished. It is valued at about $180,000. 
In that part of it devoted to the engineering laboratory new pieces of apparatus 
have been placed to the amount of about $3,500. Additions have been made to 
the boiler house and electric plant; cost, $23,000. (President J. M. Crafts.) 
Michigan Agricultural College, Agricultural College, Mich.—The past year has 
been a very successful one in the history of this college. The attendance was 
much larger than during any previous year, and good work was done in all depart- 
ments. Our State legislature dealt liberally with the college during its last session, 
making the following appropriations: 
For the erection and equipment of a woman’s building -. $95, 000    
       
    Dairy building 15, 000 
Farm barn ---- ag 4,000 
Replacing heating apparatus in Williams and Wells halls . 2,500 
Fire escapes for these halls. -- Se 500 
Student labor 5, 000 
Repairs to buildings 10, 000 
Printing experiment station bulletins. _ 8, 000 
  The increase in attendance has not been brought about by giving up any of the 
industrial features of the institution. Every student entering is required to take 
industrial work; young men ineither the agricultural or mechanical departments, 
and the young women in domestic science. Farmers’ institutes, experiment sta- 
tion bulletins, and summer excursions to the college have had much to do in bring- 
ing this institution into closer touch with the people for whose benefit it was 
established. (President J. L. Snyder.) 
University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minn.—The work in mechanical engi- 
neering has been materially strengthened during the past year by the introduction 
of a systematic course in machine design. This has brought about some changes 
in the general work of drawing and kindred subjects, which also affect and benefit 
the students in civil and electrical engineering. The administration of the work 
in shop practice has been somewhat modified, and nowincludes a course of lectures 
supplemented by shop visits which bring the student in closer touch with practical 
methods of construction. Much attention has been given to the development of 
the courses in railroad engineering, and the facilities for better instruction have 
been increased by material additions to the equipment. An air compressor for 
use on the Westinghouse airbrake has been set up in the mechanical laboratory, 
and special investigations will be carried out with this apparatus. 
The college of agriculture and the school of agriculture continue to grow 
in influence and popularity. The college course has been strengthened in the 
sciences. The work during the past year has been most satisfactory. The last 
legislature appropriated $35,000 for a new horticultural and physics building, 
which is now being erected. The size is 50 by 80 feet, three stories in height. 
The first story is of pink Kasota stone; the rest of the building is finished in red 
brick on the outside; the inside walls are of buff brick, no plaster; floors are of 
hard pine, mill construction; roof of slate. The first story is to be used for a 
botanical laboratory, the second fioor for the horticultural department, the third 
floor for the department of physics. There is to bea greenhouse laboratory annex 
25 by 50 feet, built of brick, one story in height, which will accommodate 30 stu- 
dents. The greenhouse covers 4,500 square feet, one-half of which is designed 
especially for students. There is a machine and tool exhibition room 20 by 80 
feet, and there are storage cellars 20 by 50 feet. This will greatly increase the 
facilities for instruction in horticulture and physics, and at the same time relieve

the congestion that has existed in the departments of entomology and chemistry. 
The last legislature appropriated $10,000 to enlarge our heating and lighting 
plant. (President Cyrus Northrop.) 
Mississippi Agricultural and Mechanical College, Agricultural College, Miss.— 
The course of instruction in agriculture has been enlarged in the freshman class 
by adding a course in chemistry of agriculture and a course in elementary veter- 
inary science, the two important sciences so closely connected with agriculture. 
Allfreshmen receive instruction in agriculture, horticulture, chemistry of agri- 
culture, veterinary science, and botany, besides the usual studies, giving a general 
or liberal education. The establishment and partial equipment of physical and 
electrical laboratories, an electric-light plant, and additional instruction and sys- 
tematic laboratory work in both physics and electricity have been material im- 
provements to the course of instruction in mechanic arts. Good progress has 
Deen made during the present year. The course of study is now well arranged 
and coordinated in the different departments, (President J. M. Stone.) 
Alcorn Agricultural and Mechanical College, Westside, Miss.—The following 
improvements have been made: A new barn, costing $1,000; a shoe shop, costing 
$1,000; and repairs on eight dwelling houses for professors, costing $1,200. Improve- 
ment of old lands has been carried on systematically and 40 acres of new lands have 
been cleared and improved. An increased, quantity of Indian corn, pease, Irish 
and sweet potatoes, pumpkins, cotton, clover, hay, and numerous grasses, hogs, 
cattle, and butter were produced and realized from the farm. (President W. H. 
Lanier.) 
Missouri School of Mines and Metallurgy, Rolla, Mo.—Began a new course in 
general science, four years, leading to the degree of B.S.in general science. This 
differs from the other courses in being much more largely elective. Enlargement 
of wood-working shops and dynamo laboratory begun; new system of waterworks 
completed; bathroom, with shower baths, etc., and lockers for student use added; 
physical laboratory enlarged by addition of one room. Several new advanced sub- 
jects have been added to the graduate courses. The grounds have been improved 
by planting trees and vines. A new chair, full professorship, was provided for 
this past year. (Director Geo. E. Ladd.) 
Lincoln Institute, Jefferson City, Mo.—In addition to manual training in our 
shop, as heretofore, we have decided for the coming year to give to our students 
complete trades in carpentry, blacksmithing, and machine-shop work. For the 
coming year, also, in addition to dressmaking, we shall-give the girls instruction 
in cooking and laundry work. While we erected no new buildings during the 
past year, we have repaired and improved our present ones. (President John H. 
Jackson.) 
Montana Collegeof Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, Bozeman, Mont.—No changes 
of any importance have taken place during the year in methods of instruction. A 
biological department has been organized in which opportunity will be given stu- 
dents to specialize in the direction of either zoology or botany. A short course in 
agriculture, covering three years of six months each,has been arranged. The 
standard for matriculation in college courses has been raised, and the common 
branches have been thrown out, making it necessary for students to prepare in 
these subjects in the public schools. (President James Reid.) 
University of Nebraska, Lincoln, Nebr.—Many changes in the courses of study 
have gone into effect during the year. A complete revision of the curricula in the 
College of Literature, Science, and Arts and in the Industrial College was made 
after careful and prolonged investigation by a commiitee of the general faculty. 
It was found during the past few years, in which a pretty free elective system pre- 
vailed, that the great majority of students in both colleges took what may be called 
general rather than special lines of work. Accordingly the faculty brought
-P-A-G-E-515
  
  AGRICULTURAL AND MECHANICAL COLLEGES. 1755 
together three ‘‘groups” of studies, viz, (1) classical; (2) literary; (3) scientific, 
with approximately equal entrance requirements, each of which is intended to 
give a general training. In each of these 130 hours of work are required for 
graduation, of which 36 hours are elective. The classical and literary groups 
are in the College of Literature, Science,and Arts, while the scientific group is 
in the Industrial College. In the College of Literature, Science, and Arts there 
are 18 special groups of studies, intended to supply all reasonable demands in 
the way of combinations and electives. Here also are found the teachers’ course 
and course preparatory to law and journalism. In the Industrial College there 
are seven special groups having the same purpose and four technical groups, in 
which the purpose is to give a thorough professional and practical training in a 
particular kind of work. In the Industrial College are also the practical courses 
of one, two, or three years’ length, in which those with less preparation are 
admitted to the study of agriculture, mechanic arts, domestic science, etc. 
The growing demand for opportunities for study during the summer has re- 
sulted in the development of the summer school, which had little relation to 
proper university work, into a summer session (6 weeks in length), limited almost 
entirely to certain lines of university work. 
The relations of these several groups of studies and lines of work are shown in 
the following synopsis: 
I, General groups (requiring 130 hours, of which 36 are elective): 
(a) College of Literature, Science, and Arts— 
1. General classical group (including classical studies, 24 hours; mod- 
ern language, 14; English, 14; science, 12; history and political 
science, 12). 
2. General literary group (including history and political science, 34 
hours; ancient or modern language, 16; English, 14; science, 12), 
(b) Industrial College— 
1. General scientific group (including science, 36 hours; English, 16; 
history and political science, 16; modern language, 8). « 
2. General agricultural group (including agricultural subjects, 28 
hours; science, 20; English, 16; modern language, 8; political 
science, 6). 
II. Special and technical groups (requiring 180 hours, of which at least 40 hours 
must be in the special or technical line, and usually permitting less than} 
386 hours of electives), with some practical groups (with lower require- 
ments): 
(a) College of Literature, Science, and Arts— 
1. Highteen special groups, asfollows: (1) American history and politi- 
cal science; (2) English and history; (3) English and philosophy; 
(4) English and political science; (5) Germanic and Romance lan- 
guages; (6) Greek and English literature; (7) Greek and Ger- 
manic languages; (8) Greek and Latin; (9) Greek and Romance 
languages; (10) history and philosophy; (11) history and politi- 
cal science; (12) Latin and English; (13) Latin and Germanic 
languages; (14) Latin and history; (15) Latin and Romance lan- 
guages; (16) mathematics and political science; (17) philosophy 
and political science; (18) philosophy and zoology. 
2. Law and journalism group (with the same conditions for admis- 
sion as for other groups, but requiring 66 hours; in history and 
political science, 42 hours; English, 19 hours, and philosophy, 5 
hours).* t 
8. Teachers’ course (may be elected by juniors and seniors, and in-, 
cludes 65 hours of prescribed work, of which 25 must be devoted 
to special, 12 to professional, and 22 to general knowledge).   
 
-P-A-G-E-516
  1756 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
(b) Industrial College— 
1. Seven special groups, as follows: (1) Agriculture and chemistry; 
(2) botany and agriculture; (3) botany and zoology; (4) chemis- 
try and physics; (5) horticulture and botany; (6) mathematics 
and physics; (7) zoology and philosophy. 
2. Five technical groups: (1) Technical agriculture; (2) civil engi- 
neering; (3) electrical engineering; (4) mechanical engineering; 
(5) municipal engineering. 
8. School of agriculture (including a 3-year course and a ‘short 
course”), 
. Sugar school (including a 1-year course). 
. School of mechanic arts (including a 2-year course). 
. School of domestic science (including a 2-year course). 
7. Preparatory medical group (including a 2-year course). 
In addition to the foregoing the following is an elective group for students 
in either college: Course in physical education (may be elected by sopho- 
mores, juniors, and seniors, and including 86 hours of prescribed work). 
III, Summer session (of 6 weeks, including coursesin science, English, history, 
Latin, mathematics, pedagogy, and modern language). 
The north wing of mechanic arts hall, erected at a cost of $30,000, was form- 
ally dedicated October 27, 1898. It is a substantial brick building, 65 by 120 feet 
on the ground and three stories in height, containing rooms for shops, labora- 
tories, lecture rooms, etc., for the departments of mechanical, electrical, and civil 
engineering, and temporarily for agriculture, mathematics, entomology, and 
domestic science. (Acting Chancellor C. E. Bessey.) 
Nevada State University, Reno, Nev.—The organization of the university com- 
prises the following schools of instruction and training: (a) The school of agri- 
culture; (b) the school of liberal arts; (c) the school of mines; (d) the school of 
civil engineering; (e) the school of mechanical engineering; (f) the State normal 
school; (g) a course in the theory and application of electricity. The school of 
mechanics has become the school of mechanical engineering. The course in the 
theory and application of electricity is a new course. It is not designed to bea 
full course in electrical engineering, but rather a supplement, and strengthens 
the work in all the technical schools. The courses of study in history and polit- 
ical science have been enlarged. The faculty have given careful consideration to 
improvement in all their subjects of instruction, The college needs larger library 
resources and better library facilities. 
The legislature of the State at the session of 1898 did not feel able to purchase 
land for the Experiment Station and Agricultural and Mechanical College. The 
county of Washoe, in which the university is located, purchased a valuable piece 
of land near the university and gave the land to the State for the use of the col- 
lege and station. The cost of the land was $12,000. (President J. E, Stubbs.) 
New Hampshire College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, Durham, N. H.— 
No important change has been made during the year except such as naturally 
followed from the decision indicated in the preceding report to adopt a schedule 
of entrance requirements not lower in grade than those recommended by the 
Association of American Agricultural Colleges and Experiment Stations. 
The preparatory course, adopted as a temporary expedient and incident to the 
change indicated above, has been continued and will be a necessary burden for 
one or two years at least. 
The two years’ course in agriculture required by the legislature of New Hamp- 
shire and supported in part by State appropriation is so related with the four 
years’ course in agriculture as to give a theoretical and practical training not too Qa

far removed from collegiate standards. Its permanence, however, is not yet 
established. (President C. 8. Murkland.) 
Rutgers Scientific School, New Brunswick, N. J.—The year opened with an 
increased attendance of students, the entering class being considerably larger than 
for several previous years and nearly every member of the three upper classes 
returning for the continuation of study. 
The five courses of study leading to the first degree in science (B. Sc.) have been 
maintained throughout the year. 
The course in agriculture still continues to attract attention, and reports from 
various preparatory institutions in New Jersey indicate that this course is likely 
to have an increased number of students. 
The course in civil engineering and mechanics maintains its high standard as 
well as its popularity and influence among the students. To this course has been 
added a plan, now in successful operation, for practical field work under the per- 
sonal direction of the professor of graphics and mathematics, whose class-room 
instruction in surveying and in railroad curves is thus happily supplemented. 
A professor, two associate professors, and a well-equipped laboratory make the 
facilities for instruction in the course in chemistry of a superior order. 
Those students who are preparing for post-graduate courses in technical schools 
or for electrical pursuits which do not require, at the outset, a complete profes- 
sional training find the course in electricity most useful. The physical labora- 
tory has received recent additions of wireless-telegraphy apparatus, an 8-inch 
spark coil and a Reichsanstalt photometer. 
In preparing for advanced studies in medical schools the course in biology has 
proved most helpful and has received a large number of elections. 
The arrangement of the recitation schedule has made it possible for the members 
of the senior class in the scientific school to attend the lectures in pedagogy given 
regularly to the members of this class in the classical school. 
The plan of instruction and examination in municipal hygiene introduced in 
Rutgers Scientific School last year and for the first, it is believed, in any Ameri- 
can institution, has been continued during the present year. At the examination 
held in May, 1899, two persons approved themselves as qualified to act in the exe- 
cution of the health laws of New Jersey—one as an executive health officer and 
one as a sanitary inspector. 
In the general work of the extension department three half courses of six lec- 
tures each and two half courses of seven lectures each have been given, as follows: 
One half course each on the eastern question and modern history and three half 
courses on the Victorian poets. The total attendance at the 32 lectures was 735 
persons, and the average attendance 525. The total attendance at the class hours 
following each lecture was 303 persons, and the average attendance 230. Ordinary 
half-course certificates were awarded to four persons, and an honor certificate to 
one person. 
In special work 18 lectures were given, at which the total attendance was 946 
persons, and the average attendance 681. The total attendance at the class hours 
was 600 persons, and the average attendance 425, 
The total number of catalogued and classified volumes in the library is 40,000, 
of which 3,488 volumes were added during the past year. 
During the year the membership of the faculty has been 27, and all but 3 of 
this number have given instruction in the scientific school. 
The enrollment of students for the year was 116—graduate students, 2; seniors, 
19; juniors, 21; sophomores, 21; freshmen, 47, and special students, not candidates 
for a degree, 6, There were also 53 students in the classical school and 188 pupils 
in attendance at the preparatory school. The degree of bachelor of science was 
   
-P-A-G-E-518
  1758 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
conferred upon 19 graduates in June, 1899. Of these graduates, 10 had pursued 
the course in civil engineering and mechanics, 4 the course in chemistry, 2 the 
course in electricity, and 8 the course in biology. 
The results of the work of the New Jersey State Agricultural Experiment Sta- 
tion and of the New Jersey Agricultural College Experiment Station are published 
in the form of bulletins and annual reports. One hundred and thirty-six bulletins, 
18 special bulletins, and 19 annual reports were issued by these two stations prior 
to June 30, 1899. The particular work of the Agricultural College Experiment 
Station is included in 44 of these bulletins, 13 of the special bulletins, and 11 of 
the annual reports. 
The special work of the year has been a continuation of the investigation of 
bovine tuberculosis and other diseases of animals, the fungous diseases of plants, 
the injurious insects found in New Jersey, and of the experiments in irrigation. 
(President Austin Scott.) 
New Mexico College of Agriculture and Mechanic Aris, Mesilla Park, N. Mex.— 
The courses of study in the college have not been materially changed, but in 
minor details have been strengthened. A frame building has been erected on the 
college grounds and has been used as a club house for young men. This has only 
partially met the demand for better dormitory accommodations, yet it has been 
fully occupied throughout the year. Improvements have also been made in the 
basement of the main college building. The equipment of the various depart- 
ments of the college has been added to, the electrical equipment receiving numer- 
ous additions. Satisfactory work has been done in all departments of instruc- 
tion. The enrollment has been about the same as for the year previous. A class 
of three men was graduated with the degree of bachelor of science at the close 
of the year, and the degree of master of science was conferred upon one post- 
graduate. 
The work of the experiment station has progressed satisfactorily during the 
past year. Investigations in sugar-beet culture and soil moisture have been con- 
tinued. The station has adopted the plan of issuing press bulletins weekly in ad- 
dition to the regular printed bulletins. (President Frederic W. Sanders.) 
Agricultural and Mechanical College for the Colored Race, Greensboro, N, C.— 
An architectural course has been added to the curriculum. (President James B. 
Dudley.) 
North Carolina College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, West Raleigh, N. C.— 
No material changes have been made in methods of instruction. The scope of 
instruction has been extended by the addition of a course in veterinary science 
under the direction of Prof. Cooper Curtice, B.S.,D. V.S.,M.D. Additional 
electrical apparatus has been purchased to the value of $1,000. Two additional 
rooms have been added to the mechanical building. (President Alexander Q. 
Holladay. ) 
North Dakota Agricultural College, Agricultural College, N. Dak.—A combined 
sheep and pig frame barn, 36 by 48 feet, one and one-half stories, has been contracted 
for and is about completed, as is also an addition to the mechanical building, 22 
by 36 feet, for instruction in blacksmithing. A department of steam engineering 
has been established in connection with the mechanical course, intended more 
particularly to accommodate young men desirous of operating steam traction 
engines. ’ 
The boys’ dormitory has been abandoned, rechristened Francis Hall, and remod- 
eled and converted into class rooms and laboratories, affording accoramodations 
for the departments of household economics, agriculture, horticulture, veterinary, 
and a museum. 
A brick walk, some 900 feet in length, is about completed, extending from the

  AGRICULTURAL AND MECHANICAL COLLEGES. 1759 
main college building to Francis Hall, and a wooden one from there to the barn, 
some 600 feet distant, is already completed, 
The poultry yards have been materially enlarged and the barn, implement shed, 
poultry house, farm house, and dairy building have been newly painted. 
No material change in course of study or methods of instruction, except one 
year’s work has been added to the preparatory course. Several additions have 
been made to the faculty. During July and August a four weeks’ summer train- 
ing school for teachers was conducted the same as last year, with 180 in attend- 
ance. (President J. H. Worst.) 
Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical College, Stillwater, Okla.—The charac- 
ter and manner of instruction was the same as that followed in former years, A 
two-story building of native stone, 80 by 35 feet, was erected during the year and 
fitted for instruction in mechanic arts; cost, $3,553. This increasein facilities per- 
mitted of the establishment of a course in mechanic arts. Facilities for instruc- 
tion in printing have also been provided. The courses of study for the coming 
year have been revised and arranged so as to permit of elective courses instead of- 
elective studies making up a course. There will be offered courses in general 
science and literature, agriculture, mechanical engineering, and special science, 
with (a) chemistry or (b) biology as majors. (President Angelo C. Scott.) 
Oregon State Agricultural College, Corvallis, Oreg.—An armory has been built 
costing $10,000. It is devoted primarily to military training. It is 70 by 120 feet, 
two stories, The basement story is of stone and has a commandant’s room, a phys- 
ical-culture room for young ladies, and one for young men, and a bowling alley 
for both sexes. The second story is of wood and contains a drill hall with armory 
rooms and a running gallery. The main drill room will bo fitted for a gymnasium 
also, A mechanical hall, to be known as the Morrill Mechanical Hall, 120 by 80 
feet, has been completed—two stories, stone. It contains a woodworking room 
or shop, machine shop, printing office, drawing rooms for both free-hand and 
mechanical drawing, physical laboratories, and botanical rooms. The cost is 
$21,000. A power house, including a blacksmith shop, one story, brick, costing 
$2,000, has been built. The engine rooms are supplied with boiler, engine, and 
dynamos for furnishing power to the mechanical hall and printing office and for 
lighting the various buildings. A steam heating plant has been contracted for 
and will be ready for the fall opening. It will cost about $16,000. (President 
Thomas M. Gatch.) 
Pennsylvania State College, State College, Pa.—The only important fact in rela- 
tion to the college during the year has been the steady strengthening of the work 
in the several departments, and the corresponding fact that nearly every member 
of the graduating class had secured a position for employment in the line of his 
chosen profession before commencement day. (President G. W. Atherton.) 
Rhode Island College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, Kingston, R. L—The 
institution has continued its usefulness during the past year. In the agricultural 
department the poultry school has had an increased number of students. The 
preparatory department has proved itself of great value in fitting country boys 
and girls for the college course. The biological department has had charge of a 
summer school for nature study for the teachers of Rhode Island. Over 70 teach- 
ers were in attendance, and 40 applications were refused, as our number was lim- 
ited for lack of accommodations and facilities. (President J. H. Washburn.) 
Colored Normal, Industrial, Agricultural and Mechanical College, Orangeburg, 
S. C.—There has been no change in the course of instruction. Besides Bradham 
Hall—a building three and one-half stories high, 62 by 126 feet, containing dormi- 
tories and class rooms—and a dining hall 36 by 75 feet, with an altitude of 18 feet, 
we have erected a new college building, 90 by 154 feet, containing chapel, library,  
-P-A-G-E-520
  1760 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
reading room, laboratory, two literary auditoriums, gymnasium, commercial 
department, 8 class rooms, and 50 sleeping rooms, to be heated by steam, with 
waterworks on each floor. This building will be ready for use September 20, 1899, 
and will cost not less than $27,000 when completed. We have purchased opera 
chairs for the chapel, at a cost of $1,000, and chairs for the new dormitory, at a 
cost of $200. (President Thomas E. Miller.) 
South Dakota Agricultural College, Brookings, S. Dak.—There has been a steady 
growth all through the year. More than 400 students have been in actual attend-, 
ance. Hvery department in the institution has been taxed to its utmost. The 
legislature has increased State aid materially for the future and will hereafter 
furnish about the same amount for running expenses that is provided by the 
national funds (Hatch and Morrill). It has in addition provided money for two 
new buildings to be erected this summer—one for armory and gymnasium pur- 
poses and another for the use of dairy and animal husbandry work. No changes 
whatever occurred during the year in the faculty. The new departments men- 
tioned in my last report have proyen highly popular and helpful and have been 
well patronized. The changes in courses of instruction announced last year were 
carried out, and in the main were found helpful. The freedom offered students 
in choosing majors is highly satisfactory and will be developed more fully in the 
future. Our courses are so arranged that they articulate well with the work of 
the common schools. This we regard as very important, because it brings our 
advantages within the reach of the masses, for whom they are especiaily provided. 
(President John W. Heston.) 
University of Tennessee, Knoxville, Tenn.—Courses of study and methods con- 
tinue the same. 
A new experimental barn has been erected at the farm especially for work in 
dairying. It is frame over brick basement, cement floor, iron stall fittings, etc.; 
cost, $4,200. 
The school of agriculture has been reorganized and several assistants added in 
this department of the station, viz, a dairyman, an assistant for plat experi- 
ments, and a foreman of the farm. This school is being fully equipped. 
Much new equipment has been added during the year to the mechanical depart- 
ment, a new building for which (costing about $13,000) was completed last 
autumn. (President Charles W. Dabney.) 
Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas, College Station, Tex.—A depart- 
ment of entomology was established during the year. The standard for entrance 
has been raised. A student must be able to stand examination in arithmetic and 
begin with algebra to enter our fourth (freshman) class. The State legislature 
just adjourned (July, 1899) made the following appropriations for buildings and 
improvements to be completed the coming year: For agricultural and horticul- 
tural building and equipment, $31,000; dormitory and equipment, $28,000; dwelling, 
$6,500; well and equipment, $2,500; sewerage system, $5,000; repairs, $5,000. 
‘When the above-mentioned dormitory is completed, it will furnish room for about 
200 additional students at the college, (President L. L. Foster.) t 
Agricultural College of Utah, Logan, Utah.—The last legislature made provi- 
sion for a new greenhouse, which is at present erected, at an expense of $2,800. 
Tho most noticeable progress in the college is the increased percentage of students 
who remain throughout the entire school year of ninemonths. For the benefit of 
students who can not leave the farm before November 1, provision was made by 
the last legislature for a five months’ course, extending from November 1 to 
March 81. (President J. M. Tanner.) 
Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical. College, Blacksburg, Va.—A new four 
years’ course preparatory for study of medicine has been added, and two years’ 
instruction in Spanish, and two years’ in Latin provided. Improvements: Cold

storage plant, cost $1,336; dwelling house and lot, cost $2,000; two laborers’ cot- 
tages, cost $300. (President J. M. McBryde.) 
Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute, Hampton, Va.—The general con- 
dition of the institute is good in all of its lines of work. The standard of excel- 
lence in the academic department is being raised each year. The departments of 
agriculture and mechanic arts have been strengthened by the equipment of new 
physical and chemical laboratories. The courses in the trade school have been 
enriched, and the entrance requirements to these courses have been raised. In 
the agricultural department a dairy course has been started, the elementary course 
in agriculture has been opened to all the girls of the academic department, and 
the special course in agriculture, leading to a certificate, bas been made a post- 
graduate course. The work in domestic science has been greatly advanced by the 
addition of new and commodious sewing rooms and a well-equipped kitchen. 
The effort in each department is to keep in touch with every-day life and to make 
its work as concrete and practical as possible. (Principal H. B. Frissell.) 
Washington Agricultural College and School of Science, Pullman, Wash.—One 
hundred thousand dollars have been appropriated for the construction of Science 
Hall for the departments of botany, zoology, bacteriology, agriculture, horticul- 
ture, veterinary science, and geology, and museum; also forge shop and foundry 
and rebuilding Ferry Hall (the boys’ dormitory). These buildings are under con- 
struction. (President E. A. Bryan.) 
West Virginia University, Morgantown, W. Va.—A department of domestic 
science has been established, and our premedical course has been made to cover 
two years. Fellowships in chemistry, Latin, mathematics, agriculture, econom- 
ics, elocution, English literature, Romance languages, and German have been 
established. Three new buildings are to be erected: A library building, to cost 
about $50,000; mechanic arts building, to cost about $30,000, and an armory, to 
cost about $12,000. (President Jerome H. Raymond.) « 
West Virginia Colored Institute, Institute, W. Va.—Since the last report our 
English course has been materially broadened. Our mechanical course has been 
strengthened by the appointment of two new teachers and the purchase of addi- 
tional mechanical appliances. We have now in course of erection one brick dor- 
mitory which will accommodate 100 boys, and we are also making a much-needed 
and substantial brick and stone addition to our main building. The boys’ new 
dormitory, when completed, will cost $15,000, and the addition to the main build- 
ing $6,000. We have also added a new electric plant and engine, at a cost of 
$8,000. (President J. McHenry Jones. ) 
University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wis.—During the year a dairy barn and 
stock-judging building has been completed at a cost of $18,000, In this structure: 
the latest ideas relative to the economic healthful housing of dairy stock has been 
incorporated. The building is lighted by electricity and three electric motors 
furnish the required power. A large room is provided for stock-judging purposes. 
This room, which is 40 by 70 feet in area, is warmed by steam heat and is lighted 
from above by means of skylights. (President C. K. Adams.) 
University of Wyoming, Laramie, Wyo.—During the past year an addition to 
our greenhouse has been built at a cost of $900. In our military department we 
have been without a regular officer from the United States Army and one of our 
professors has taken charge of the department. On the whole, he has been a great: 
success and shown himself surprisingly competent for that line of work. Our 
normal department will be greatly strengthened the coming year; a business col- 
lege will be added to the courses of study and some minor changes will be made

IH.—INSTRUCTION IN DAIRYING. 
Prior to the passage by the Congress of the United States of the act of July 2, 
1862, donating lands to the several States for the purpose of establishing institu- 
tions in which the leading object should be instruction in agriculture. and the 
mechanic arts, very little had been done in this country for the scientific educa- 
tion of the farmer. The passage of the said act and of the act of August 30, 1890, 
for the more complete endowment and support of the institutions established 
under the provisions of the act of July 2, 1862, resulted in the establishment of 
what are generally known as “agricultural and mechanical colleges” in each 
State and Territory of thecountry. The courses of study provided for the farmer 
or for those who wished to prepare themselves as such were intended to cover the 
entire field of agriculture as well as to furnish a good general education. Thus, 
while general instruction in dairying as it should be carried on by the farmer was 
included in the agricultural course, no provision was.made until a comparatively 
recent date for the education of persons who were to devote themselves to the 
making of buiter and cheese. 
On account of the lack of such instruction creamery men were compelled to rely 
upon their own efforts for any improvements in the methods of manufacturing 
dairy products, and as a result could not compete successfully with the butter and 
cheese makers of countries where instruction in dairying and investigations into 
the subject were carried on. In order that the dairy interests of the country 
might be fostered as much as possible it was considered necessary to provide the 
needed instruction, and thus special schools of dairying were established in con- 
nection with the agricultural colleges of the country. The establishment of 
experiment stations in connection with these institutions, under an act of Congress 
of March 2, 1887, undoubtedly assisted in the founding of dairy schools, as it 
opened the way for investigation of the subjects to be taught therein. 
The Wisconsin Dairy School of the University of Wisconsin was established in 
January, 1890, and in 1891 the legislature of that State appropriated $25,000 for 
the erection of a dairy building in connection with the dairy school. These steps 
were quickly followed by other States. The popularity of these schools and the 
demand for the services of persons who have received instruction therein are 
proofs of the wisdom of their establishment. 
In his report for the years 1896-97 and 1897-98 to the board of regents of the 
University of Wisconsin, President C. K. Adams says: ‘‘Our dairy department 
has now sent out more than 700 trained students, and still the demand is far more 
than we can supply. There are now about 2,500 creameries and cheese factories 
in the State. * * * The importance of the work of the school is indicated by 
asingle fact. Only a few years ago Wisconsin cheese was worth in the market 
from 2 to5 cents a pound less than the cheese of New York, but at present, chiefiy— 
directly or indirectly—through the teachings of the dairy school, the relations of 
the products of these States in the market, as well as in the opinions of experts, 
have been reversed.” 
In the tenth biennial report of the board of regents of the University of Minne- 
sota the influence of the dairy school of that institution upon the dairy industry 
is stated as follows: ‘‘ Since the establishment of this school dairy industry has 
made such remarkable growth that Minnesota is now recognized as one of the lead- 
ing dairy States of the Union. * * * 
“During the past two years some 200 new creameries have been built, equipped, 
and are being successfully operated, bringing the number of creameries in the 
State up to 650. When the last biennial report was made it was estimated that 
half of the dairy products in the State was manufactured in creameries. Now 
the product of the creameries is about 50 per cent greater than that of the home 
dairy. A careful estimate of the annual amount received by patrons of the cream-
-P-A-G-E-523
  
AGRICULTURAL AND MECHANICAL COLLEGES. 1763 
eries in this State is $10,000,000, and the receipts from the home dairy $6,500,000. 
During the seven years that the school has been established, 484 students have 
been in attendance.” 
Probably the most importantinvention as an aid to the dairying interests of the 
country is the Babcock milk test, invented by Dr. S. M. Babcock of the University 
of Wisconsin, by means of which it is possible to determine the amount of fat in 
milk, This method of testing milk is taught in the dairy schools of the country, 
and is in almost universal use even in home dairies. As the quantity and quality 
of butter that may be made out of a certain amount of milk depends upon the 
amount of fat contained therein, the price paid for milk by some creameries is 
regulated by the amount of fat it contains as determined by means of the milk 
test. Inthe report of the University of Wisconsin, quoted above, President Adams 
calls attention to another aid to the dairying interests. He says: ‘‘ Probably next 
in importance to the invention of the Babcock milk test has been the Wisconsin 
curd test, also devised at this station. This is a simple method of treating a sam- 
ple of milk so that it will show to the operator whether or not milk is contami- 
nated or tainted in any way so as to unfit it for use in the dairy, especially for use 
in cheese making. Not infrequently the product of our cheese factories is depre- 
ciated in value from $5 to $15 per day for weeks at a time because of bad milk, 
It has been calculated that $100,000 a year is not too small an estimate for losses 
to our dairymen from this source. The experiment station is now teaching the 
dairy pupils the use of this test, and its introduction over the State is spreading 
rapidly, The Wisconsin Dairymen’s Association for 1898 and the Quebec Dairy- 
men’s Association for 1897 have both warmly commended the test as having already 
greatly increased the vaiue of dairy products.” « 
The special dairy schools are not conducted throughout the entirescholastic year, 
but are opened, as a rule, in December or January, and continue for from four to 
twelve weeks, the length of the course varying in the several States. These special 
courses, keing intended especially for persons who have had some experience in 
ereameries or cheese factories, are given in the winter season, as that is the most 
convenient time for creamery men to leavetheir work, the summer months always 
being the busiest in creameries. In some of the schools one of the requirements 
for admission is that the applicant shall have had practical experience in cream- 
eries. Owing to thelarge amount of practical work included in the courses of these 
schocls the number of students admitted at any onetime is necessarily limited to 
such number as can be accommodated at the machinery and other apparatus of 
the department. 
In the following pages are given outlines of the instruction in dairying offered 
by the various agricultural colleges with special reference to instruction in butter 
and cheese making. The special courses in dairying are given in full, so far as 
they are published in the annual catalogues, together with a description of the 
equipment for instruction in practical dairying. As may be seen, some of the 
States do not provide special courses for the instruction of butter and ‘cheese 
makers, but the only instruction offered in dairying is that included in the regular 
agricultural courses.

MICHIGAN AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE. 
Equipment.--By means of actual work in the dairy room instruction in butter 
making is given to all students in the agricultural course. Emphasis is laid on 
the methods of cleaning and keeping clean the dairy room and dairy implements. 
The dairy room is equipped with various styles of creamers, separators, ripening 
vats, churns, and workers, with the use of which young men become acquainted 
by daily experience. The Babcock test is in constant use, and the subjects of 
pasteurization and sterilization receive attention. Later, if the student so elects, 
special work along dairy lines is given in the senior year, embracing a more 
thorough training in the art of butter making, along with a short course, at least, 
in dairy bacteriology and dairy chemistry. 
Special short courses beginning with the opening of the winter term in the first 
week in January have been arranged as follows: Courses of six weeks each in dairy 
husbandry and creamery, and a course of four weeks in cheese making. 
I,—DAIRY HUSBANDRY. 
1. Selection of dairy herd.—The college is well equipped with the highest types 
of dairy cows belonging to various breeds. Using the members of this herd as a 
model, the class goes over the various points of the typical dairy animal, score 
card in hand, until the significance of every variation in form is well understood. 
Since the records of all the cows are kept it is possible to verify or correct the 
judgment of the student. 
2, Feeding cattle.—An hour a day for the first two weeks of the term is given to 
the study of the theory of cattle feeding, definition of terms, discussion of feeding 
stuffs in the markets of the State or grown on the farm, calculation of rations, the 
use of table of analysis, the nutritive ratio, and the balanced ratio. A discussion 
of economical methods of storing feed and the general care of the dairy herd follows. 
Such topics as stall fittings, stable construction, preparation of feeding stuffs, 
quantities of feed to be given under different circumstances, exercising and water- 
ing dairy cows, and general stable management are taken up in turn and as fully 
dealt with as time will allow. 3 
3. Veterinary science.—A series of 80 lectures on bovine anatomy, hygiene, and 
medicine forms a very important feature in the course. 
4. Butter making.—Along with a course of lectures on the physical properties 
of milk and its constituents there.is given practical work in the butter room in the
-P-A-G-E-529
  AGRICULTURAL. AND MECHANICAL COLLEGES. 1769 
handling of milk, cream, and butter, and in all the details of manipulation from 
the time the milk leaves the udder of the cow until it is made up into a first-class 
article of butter and the skim milk prepared for feeding calves and pigs. Among 
the topics upon which special emphasis is laid the following may be mentioned: 
Aeration and aerators, cleanliness both in milking and in the washing and care of 
utensils, the use of various styles of creamers and separators, ripening cream 
with and without commercial starters, preparation of home-made starters, ripen- 
ing cream, churning temperatures, styles of churns. washing butter, and the 
various methods of printing and packing for market. Special work in pasteurizing 
milk and cream for market or for home use is given. 
5, A course of lectures is given on the physical properties of milk and its con- 
stituents, explaining the reasons for the consecutive steps in the progress of the 
milk through the butter room on its way to the completed product. The object 
of this course is to do away with empiricism in the work and to give the student 
a coherent and logical view of butter making as a whole, and the relation of each 
process recommended to the success of the undertaking. 
6. The Babcock test and lactometer.—These modern instruments are in daily use 
in the butter room, but special work is given with them that the students may 
become accurate and at the same time acquire a correct idea of the physical and 
chemical composition of milk and its products. 
7, Dairy bacteriology.—A short course in elementary bacteriology is given that 
the student may understand how closely the quality of the butter is related to the 
cultivation of the right kind of bacterial life in the milk and cream and the exclu- 
sion of foes by scrupulous cleanliness and proper regulation of temperature. 
Il.—THE CREAMERY COURSE, 
1. Creamery methods.—Lectures and exercises will be given in the methods of 
keeping books, illustrated daily by the business operations of the college dairy. 
Payments are calculated on the basis of fat content. Methods of conducting the 
regular business of the creamery, accounts with patrons, with consignees, business 
forms and routine business, are subjects upon which daily instruction is given. A 
course of lectures will be given on the physics and chemistry of milk and its 
products, explaining the reasons for each operation performed in the factory and 
the chemical and physical facts upon which it depends. The several constituents 
of milk are separately examined and the relation of each to the various operations 
in butter making is explained. The separator and churn are studied and the 
natural laws governing their work are outlined. 
2, Daily work in the butter room.—The daily practical work in butter making is 
the dominant feature of the course, to which all others are subordinated. Sepa- 
rators are unpacked, set up, run, and tested; milk is separated at different tem- 
peratures and under different conditions, until the student is thoroughly versed 
in all the details of handling milk and.operating separators. Cream is ripened in 
various ways and with different kinds of vats and apparatus. The churning is 
done as in an ordinary creamery and repeated until the class is familiar with all 
the steps in the operation. The Babcock test is in constant use. 
&. Creamery mechanics.—As thorough Grill as possible is given in the care and 
operation of boilers and engines and the general principles of construction and 
operation of mechanical appliances used in creameries. The arrangement, size. 
and speed of shafting, belts, and pulleys will receive attention. The student will 
be qualitied to do all necessary pipe fitting and to care for the machinery of the 
creamery intelligently. 
4. Milk testing..-Thorough drill is given in the laboratory in the testing of 
milk, This work includes the calibration of glassware to determine whether or 
not the test bottles and pipettes in use are correct, the determination of the 
strength of acid, and the testing of milk under all the varying conditions met 
with in the daily operations of a factory. The use of preservatives for keeping 
milk in condition for testing and the handling of composite samples is also studied. 
In addition to teaching the use of the Babcock test, practice is given in detecting 
adulteration in milk by the use of the lactometer in connection with the Babcock 
test. The use of the various tests for acidity of cream are also studied and the 
different methods put into practice in the work in the creamery room. 
5, Dairy bacteriology.—This subject is taught by a course of lectures and demon- 
strations, though little more is attempted than to give the student an appreciative 
idea of what bacteria are and their relation to the art of butter making. Therea- 
sons for cleanliness in every dairy operation are pointed out. The manufacture 
and use of the several kinds of starters and their relative merits are explained. 
6. Milk production.—The creamery manager should be posted not only on mat- 
 
-P-A-G-E-530

ters relating to the care of the milk prior to its delivery to the factory, but on the 
essential principles of stock feeding, bovine anatomy and medicine, and treatment 
of the cows to produce the greatest flow of milk as weil, that he may be competent 
to give advice to patrons on these subjects. 
7. Butter gudging.—Daily work is given that the student may acquire an accu- 
rate taste and smell, and be able to discriminate between good and poor butter, 
and to recognize faults in the products of his own factory when such occur. 
Ill.—COURSE IN CHEESE MAKING. 
Practical work at the cheese vat followed out along scientific lines, with a reason 
for every detail of the operation, isa feature of thiscourse. The use of the rennet 
tests for determining the ripeness of milk, the use of starter to aid in the control 
of fermentation, the use of the curd test for the detection of impuritiesin the milk, 
and the use of the Babcock test to determine the loss of butter fat are among the 
points given especial attention in the daily operations in the cheese room. Work 
will be given ia the laboratory in testing milk. The use of the lactometer and 
Babcock test for the detection of watering and skimming milk will be taught and 
the practical application of the test to everyday cheese-factory operations will be 
emphasized, Lectures and demonstrations in bacteriology, showing the relation 
of bacteria to the different changes taking place in milk, how to combat harmful 
agencies and cultivate the helpful ones, are given. The subject of chemistry of 
milk and its care upon the farm receives attention. (Catalogue, 1898-99,)

The dairy course opens the 1st of December of each year and lasts twelve weeks. 
The class is divided into three sections, one of which is assigned daily to the lab- 
oratory, asecond to the creamery, and a third to the cheesefactory. Thesections 
alternate, so that each student receives instruction twice a week in each of the 
three departments. The courses are arranged as follows: 
1. Lectures and class-room work.—Twenty-four lectures on the constitution of 
milk, the conditions which affect creaming and churning, methods of milk testing

IV.—INSTRUCTION IN DOMESTIC OR HOUSEHOLD ECONOMY AND 
A 
Instruction in household economy is now being given by a number of the insti- 
tutions endowed by the acts of Congress of July 2, 1862, and August 30, 1890. 
The object of such instruction is to provide for the young women attending the 
institutions the training that will enable them to understand and to perform. 
properly the duties of the household, such as preparing, cooking, and serving 
good and wholesome food economically, arrangement and decoration of the 
interior of the house, sewing, dressmaking, millinery, etc. The importance of 
such instruction is being recognized more and more, and in several States special 
buildings for the department of domestic economy have been provided.

Facilities.—Domestic Economy Hall includes, besides the general office, the 
sewing room; dressmaking room, bedroom, kitchen, dining room, and store- 
rooms, all conveniently furnished and equipped for recitations and for demonstra- 
tion and practice work. The means of instruction include text-book study, lec- 
tures on the allied topics, demonstration lessons, and laboratory practice, supple- 
mented by incidental talks, research, and essay writing on assigned subjects, and 
visits for observation and criticism. The plan followed in arranging the courses 
combines the actual doing with the study of how and why to do, that manual 
dexterity may be developed at the same time that study promotes an understand- 
ing of the principles underlying directions and rules. 
Course I.—Plain sewing.—During the first term of the freshman year young 
women meet once a week for instruction in sewing, with three hours of practice. 
Each pupil makes for herself a set of models, including the various stitches, seams, 
hems, fastenings, plackets, etc., with their several applications in garment mak- 
ing and household sewing and mending. Accompanying the models a series of 
notes is prepared from lectures by the instructor upon the fabrics, tools, and other 
manufactures employed, and upon the making and use of each model. 
Course IT.—Cooking and hygiene.—During the second term of the freshman year 
cooking is taught to classes meeting each week for a one-hour recitation or lecture 
and a three-hour-period in laboratory practice. During this term the various food 
stuffs, separate and combined, are studied in connection with the cooking proc- 
esses and principles. Many simple and substantial dishes are prepared by the 
pupils, who at the same time receive instruction in general kitchen management. 
Course HI.—Cooking and hygiene.—Students who have completed Course II 
continue, during the first term of the sophomore year, the same subjects. In 
connection with cooking, special attention is given to the combining of foods and 
the serving of foods in connection with general dining-room work. Table setting, 
the selection and care of table jurnishings, the duties of the hostess and waitress, 
and kindred subjects are discussed, with object lessons and practice. One houra 
week is devoted to domestic hygiene or home sanitation. This includes such 
topics as the location and construction of the house; its arrangement, lighting, 
plumbing, ventilation, heating,furnishing,and cleaning. The principles of clean- 
ing and disinfection are also applied to the processes of laundry work. 
Course IV.—Sewing.—Students who have completed Course I continue their 
sewing in garment work. Each onechooses her materials for a suit of underwear 
which she designs, ‘cuts, fits, and finishes for herself under the direction of the 
instructor. (Sophomore, second term.) 
Course V.—Dressmaking.—Each young woman is expected to purchase, design, 
and make one unlined cotton dress and one of woolen or other material with a 
lining. (Junior, first term.) 
Course VI,—Cooking.—For the second term of the junior year opportunity is 
offered for such students as have comp'eted Courses Il and Iil to have more 
instruction and practice in the art of cookery. Thefood preparation for this term 
is somewhat more difficult and elaborate than in the previous terms, and includes 
soups, roasts, bread and rolls, sauces, salads, and Cesserts of different kinds, which 
have not been made before, the particular assignment depending largely upon the 
individual need of the student. 
Course VII.—Sewing.—A fourth term of sewing is also provided for the second 
term of the junior year for those wishing to study the drafting of patterns to 
measure in connection with more of designing and dressmaking. 
Course VIII.—Cooking.—The last term in domestic economy (senior year, second 
term) is devoted principally to the study of foods from the hygienic and economic 
standpoints; and the practice is designed to demonstrate the proper combination 
and economical preparation of the common materials. Study of cooking and 
serving for the invalid occupies several weeks of this course, and is supplemented 
by general consideration of the duties of the nurse in the home and the desirable 
conditions and care for the bedroom in sickness and health.

During the first term of the senior year no work was offered in this department, 
ag provision is made in the dairy course for young women who desire instruction 
in home dairying; and at the same time the department of chemistry offers a series 
of lectures'in domestic chemistry. 
Course [X.—To graduates who have completed the undergraduate courses out- 
lined above, instruction and opportunity for advanced work is offered. Study and 
investigation along the line of the chemistry and physiology of foods, practical 
dietetics, home sanitation, cooking, and the other household arts, is pursued in 
connection with work elected in the departments of botany, chemistry, and other 
sciences. (Catalogue, 1898-99.) 
Kansas STATE AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE, 
Equipment.—Domestic Science Hall, 84 by 70 feet, contains two stories and base- 
ment. The first story and basement are occupied by the department of household 
economics, lunches to the students and members of the faculty being served in the 
basement. The second floor is occupied in part by the department of music and 
in part by that of sewing. 
The purpose of the course of domestic science is to afford training in the special 
subjects which must be considered in the daily administration of every home. 
1, Hygiene.— The course of lectures in elementary hygiene is given to both young 
men and young women. The instruction of the young women is under the direc- 
tion of the professor of domestic science. The general principles of wholesome 
living and the general care of the human body will be the leading subjects con- 
sidered. (First year, fall term.) 
In the following courses the work is arranged on educational as well as tech- 
nical lines, and offers both theoretical and practical instruction, and is given in a 
well-equipped domestic science laboratory. The student is required to keep a set 
of notebooks, namely: A permanent notebook, a daily class record of class and 
personal work, and a recipe book. This plan enables the student to keep a clear, 
systematic, and concise record of every detail and objective point in the work. 
The lectures and practical work in cooking are presented in four courses and two 
special professional courses on the following lines: 
2. Household economics.—First year, winter term. Lectures, with weekly lab- 
oratory practice. The objective points, neatness, order, economy, and accuracy 
will be observed. The subject of cookery, its origin, purpose, etc., table of meas- 
urements and weights, directions in measuring, definitions pertaining to manipu- 
lations, methods of cookery, etc., the general care of utensils, the kitchen and its 
adjoining apartments, the general sanitation of the home, general household man- 
pzament; and home ethics constitute the leading subjects of practice and lecture 
work, 
3. Chemistry of cookery.—Third year, fall term. Text-books, Mathieu Wil- 
ees Chemistry of Cookery, and Ellen H. Richards’s Chemistry of Cooking and 
Cleaning. 
4. Domestic science.—Third year. Lectures, recitations, and laboratory instruc- 
tion are combined throughout the year, Fall term: A course in fruit cookery; 
plain household cookery; lectures upon the food principles; classification, elemen- 
tary composition of the human body; study of fuels; heat and its effect; cooking 
temperatures, etc. Winter term: Plain household cookery continued; advanced 
household cookery the latter half of theterm. Spring term: Advanced househo!d 
cookery the first half of the term; high-class cookery the second half of the term; 
standard menus and general lectures in the science of nutrition with parallel 
readings are reauired. Instruction in general serving and entertaining is given. 
5. Therapeutic cookery.—Fourth year, fall term. Special cookery for the sick 
and its application to the home and for hospital nurses in training. 
6, Emergency lectures and special physiology.—Fourth year, winter term. First 
aids to the injured; lectures on home nursing. 
7. Demonstrations.~Fourth year, spring term. Lecture work in scientific and 
practical cookery. Each student is required to give a demonstration lecture in 
cooking before the class and give approved recipes, observing all the educational, 
scientific, technical, and practical points involved in each method demonstrated. 
The student lecturer may select one assistant from the class to assist in the gen- 
eral details of the work. In connection with this lecture work each student is 
required to give a complete lesson outline and conduct one class in practical work 
according to the Lest approved methods in laboratory practice. The two profes- 
fessional courses are designed to meet the demand for more thoroughly and 
broadly trained young women who go out as graduates. The work of the fourth 
year is planned so as to give the professional training that a complete course of 
domestic science should involve.

UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA (SCHOOL OF AGRICULTURE). 
Cooking.—First year, second term: Kitchen management; care of cooking uten- 
sils, glass, china, and silver ware; measuring and invoicing; cooking vegetables, 
cereals, and bread. Second year, first term: Canning, preserving, pickling, and 
jelly making; soups, eggs,and meats. Second year, second term: Marketing, care

Domestic chemistry.—Third year, second term: Instruction is given in the chem- 
istry and economy of human foods. Simple tests for the detection of the adulter- 
ation of foods are given. The chemistry of cleaning material and the composi- 
tion of various household articles are considered. The instruction is given in the 
form of laboratory practice. 
Home economy.—Second year, second term: This work is taught as the just pro- 
portion between income and expenditure; the distinction of econumy, frugality, 
and parsimony are considered with reference to a definite proportion in the expendi- 
tures which are made for existence, comfort, culture, and philanthropy. <A study 
is made of the sources of income, especially of the income from the farm in the 
form of house, food, and luxuries. The purchase of clothing, household stores, 
and furnishings is considered from the standpoint of the suitable. The relation of 
cash and credit tocost isalsoconsidered. Attention is given to savings and forms 
of investment, a bank account and the use of a check book. Each student in this 
class is required to submit at the close of the term a paper setting forth in detail 
the use of a certain named income for one year, embracing not only every item of 
necessary home expense but also an outlay made for travel, luxuries, accident, 
sickness, and other emergencies. The habit of keeping a household account is 
calculated to strengthen the judgment in making a wise use of money, therefore 
an analysis and study of expenditures as here indicated serves to bring clearly 
before the student's mind the relative importance of the different things which 
money will procure. 
Home management.—First year, second term: This includes both housekeeping 
and home making, and the teaching of the subject naturally falls into three divi- 
sions, household work, sanitation, and family life. The instruction is based upon 
the belief that housekeeping is as important as it is difficult, and that home 
making is the noblest form of human endeavor, The points in detail in the prep- 
aration of food, the making of clothing, the care of the house and household be- 
longings, and the ordering of the family life are considered in their relation to an 
adequate plan for home management. To start the student in the correct way of 
becoming mistress of the business of housekeeping istheendsought. It is believed 
that for one who knows the reason for the doing there isno drudgery; thereforestu- 
dents are taught the specific danger that lurks in dust and dirt, in order that they 
may understand the dignity of the unceasing war which the housekeeper makes 
upon these forces. The practical benefit to be derived trom the knowledge stu- 
dents have gained in the cooking, sewing, laundering, and dairy classes is empha- 
sized and shown in its relation to an adequate plan for the daily programme for the 
home. While the science of family life has not been formulated, yet some of its 
fundamental principles are recognized and may be taught. 
Household art.—Second year, first term: This is taught by a series of lectures 
treating of the adornment of the house and grounds, noting the distinctive char- 
acter of the country home and opportunity for embellishment found in the sur- 
roundings. The intention is to show that thought and energy can accomplish as 
much or more than money in making a farm home attractive; also to show the 
importance of acquiring correct knowledge and correct taste in order to secure 
every possible convenience, combined with harmonious forms, colors, and styles
-P-A-G-E-543
  
  AGRICULTURAL AND MECHANICAL COLLEGES. 1783 
in walls, draperies, and furniture. The true relation of beauty, use, and influence 
of surroundings upon life and character are considered in connection with the pos- 
sibilities for improvement that may be found in simple and inexpensive methods. 
Hygiene.—Third year. second term: Hygiene as a special study for women con: 
siders the health of the family as dependent upon pure food, pure water, personal 
cleanliness, and proper habits, as well as upon heredity. The aim is to show how 
a correct knowledge of the Jaws of nature is essential not only to the restoration 
but to the preservation of health. Several lectures by a physician will be given 
upon maidenhood, maternity, motherhood, infancy, and related subjects. These 
special lectures will be supplemented by the regular Jectures in class, thus extend- 
ing and simplifying the subjects in plain and easily understood terms. 
Laundering.—First year, first term: Several lectures are given and practice 
work is provided in washing, ironing, starching, polishing, cleaning, and pressing 
clothing. 
Sewing.—During the first year (first term) students receive instruction in the 
elements of sewing; different stiches, such as basting, seaming, hemming, darn- 
ing, buttonholing, and patching are taught, and practice is given in the use of all 
the implements belonging to the sewing basket. The second year’s work consists 
of cutting and making plain garments, such as underwear, children’s -clothing, 
shirt waists, and cotton dresses. In the third year the more difficult work of dress- 
making is taken up. The cutting and fitting of dresses and jackets are taught by 
a very simple system; careful attention is given to quality of materials and har- 
mony of colors. The course is designed to make each graduate capable of doing 
all kinds of sewing needed in the home. (Catalogue, 1898-99.) 
Montana COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE AND MECHANIC ARTS, 
Sewing.—All the ordinary forms of sewing are taught, including garment mak- 
ing, dressmaking, and embroidery. The work is carefully graded according to 
the capabilities of the student, and may be utilized by her in the making of her 
own clothing. A straight-line system of cutting and fitting is taught, and sys- 
tems are furnished at cost. The sewing room is furnished with a large cutting

Nortu Dakota AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE. 
Ccoking.—There are two courses of cookery; one aims to give the students who 
have but a limited time the work that will be of most value to them, and includes 
plain cooking, dealing with soups, meats, vegetables, breads, invalid cookery and 
plain desserts; also the care and management of different rooms of a house, order 
and arrangement of household duties and practical experience in planning and 
serving meals. The regular course begins with the first term of the freshman 
year, one hour each day, in the study of the home, its proper construction and 
location, its sanitation and hygiene, including the heating, plumbing, etc., also 
how to furnish the home artistically as well as economically and hygienically; 
also the proper care of the body with regard to clothing, diet, exercise, and rest. 
Much help is gained from the class study of houses in the process of construction, 
different types of homes, interior decorations, etc. 
Sewing.—The course in sewing is very complete, beginning with plain necdle- 
work. One term is required to be devoted to the making of a model book, which 
is composed of different samples of hemming, running, felling, darning, patching, 
etc.; these when mounted in the book with full explanation are very helpful for 
reference. The next work is the drafting and making of cotton and linen gar- 
ments, which is followed by work in dressmaking. This includes the drafting, 
cutting, fitting, and finishing of dresses. A study of color combination and work 
in embroidery is taken up later in the course. 
Equipment.—The department has four rooms. The lecture room is well fur- 
nished and is used for office purposes, lectures, and recitations. Large doors 
opening from the room on one side connect with the sewing room and on the other 
with the kitchen laboratory. The sewing room is provided with machines, sew- 
ing tables, cutting and pressing tables with gas connection, chiffonier for mate- 
rials, blackboard, mirror, and other necessary furniture. The kitchen laboratory 
is equipped with work desks at which each student has her place and keeps her 
utensils. The work desks are supplied with gas for cooking, but the students are 
given experience in the management and care of the kitchen range, which is used 
when the meals are prepared. Other appliances available for use or illustration 
are the Aladdin oven, small electrical stove, balances for practical and experi- 
mental use, food museum showing the composition and nutritive value of some 
of the principal foods, food charts, and microscope. It is also aimed to use those 
kitchen conveniences that tend to simplify and economize household labor. The 
dining room is supplied with dining-room furnishings, and makes a home-like 
place in which the practice meals prepared by the studentsare served. (Circular 
of Information, 1899.)

  CHAPTER XL. 
STATISTICS OF NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
The number of persons engaged in teaching in the United States, from kinder- 
garten to university, exceeds 485,000. To recruit this vast army of teachers, there 
were 93,687 students in the scholastic year ending June, 1899, pursuing training 
courses for teachers in institutions of various grades. Of these students, 56,279 
were being educated in 739 public institutions and 87,408 in 749 private institu- 
tions. About 48 per cent of the total number, or 44,808, were in the 166 public 
normal schools, while 23,572 were reported from 165 private normal schools, The 
normal students in 29 public universities and colleges numbered 2,541; in 206 pri- 
vate universities and colleges, 6,950; in 544 public high schools, 8,930, and in 87: 
private high schools and academies, 6,886. The following table shows the number 
of institutions of each class and the number of normal students in each class for 
four scholastic years: 
Normal students reported for four years.

The 166 public normal schools had an average of 270 students to the school, and 
the 165 private normal schools an average of 142 to the school. The 29 public 
universities and colleges reporting normal students had an average of 84 to the 
institution, while 208 private universities and colleges had an average of nearly 
34, The average number of normal students in 544 public high schools was 16, 
and the average number in 378 private high schools 18, These averages have ref- 
erence only te students pursuing training courses for teachers. Students in other 
courses are enumerated elsewhere. 
The number of students graduating from the teachers’ training courses of the 
public and private normal schools in 1899 was 11,175. The normal graduates of 
other institutions were not reported to this office, but it may be estimated that 
the number of students graduating from normal courses in all the institutions 
named, including the normal schools, was not less than 15,300. But this number 
does not represent the entire number of recruits added to the teaching force of 
the country each year. Thousands leave the normal schools after one year’s study 
and begin the work of teaching, while thousands more join the ranks from other 
institutions.

The distribution of normal students by States and Territories classified as in 
the above table is shown in Table 17 in this chapter. With two exceptions all 
the States and organized Territories make provision for the education of teachers 
in public normal! schools. Nevada and Wyoming have no public normal schools, 
but their State universities have departments for the free education of teachers. 
Tennessee has not a normal school completely under State control, but the legis- 
lature makes an annual appropriation of $20,000 to the Peabody Normal College 
of the University of Nashville, providing for a certain number of free State schol- 
arships. The State board of education has also a voice in the management of the 
affairs of the college. The State makes still further provision for the education 
of teachers in the University of Tennessee, where tuition is free, 
PUBLIC NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
The summarized statistics of the 166 public normal schools will be found in 
Tables 1 to 8, while detailed information concerning the schools will be found in 
Table 19. 
The number of public normal schools in each State is shown in the first column 
of Table 1. Fifteen States and Territories support only 1 school each. Massa- 
chusetts has 10 schools, New York and Pennsylvania 15 each. These three States 
have nearly one-fourth the public normal schools in the United States and more 
than one-third of the normal students. In the 166 schools there were 2,057 teach- 
ers employed in instructing students in normal departments and 693 engaged 
wholly in other departments. The North Atlantic Division had $99 of the teach- 
ers for normal students, the North Central Division 638, the two southern divi- 
sions 174 each, and the Western Division 172. Of the 2,057 teachers, 839 are men 
and 1,218 are women. 
Tables 2 and 3 surnmarize the enrollment of students in the public normal 
schools. Of the 44,808 students in the normal departments, there were 11,543 
mates and 33,265 females. The North Atlantic Division has 17,714 students, 
15,035 of these being in Massachusetts, New York, and Pennsylvania. In the 
North Central Division the students in normal departments numbered 16,325, 
quite evenly distributed. The South Atlantic Division had 3,794, the South Cen- 
tral 3,272, and the Western Division 3,703. The public normal schools had 866 
students in business courses, 4,804 in secondary grades equivalent to high-school 
grades, and 24,690 pupils in elementary grades. The grand total, as shown in the 
first column of Table 3, was 75,168. The number of colored normal students 
included was 1,138, nearly all in the public normal schools for educating colored 
teachers in the Southern States. 
Many of the public normal schools use their elementary departments as model 
schools, while some maintain no model schools of their own, but use for the same 
purpose the elementary grades in convenient public day schools. 
Table 4 shows that in 1899 the number of teachers graduating from the public 
normal schools was 8,948, the number of male graduates being 1,635 and the 
number of female graduates 7,318, The North Atlantic Division alone had more 
than half of these graduates, or 4,653. The North Central Division had 2,530 
graduates, the South Atlantic 480, the South Central 461, and the Western Division 
824. These schools had 182 graduates from business courses and 654 from other 
courses. 
The income of the public normal schools for each State is shown in Table 5. 
The appropriations from States, counties, and cities for support for the 135 
schools reporting this item aggregated $2,510,934. The total income for the year 
from appropriations, tuition fees, productive funds, and from other sources 
reported by 141 schools was $3,484,107. Tuition fees received by 105 schools 
aggregated $498,719, and the greater part of this sum must have been paid by stu-    
-P-A-G-E-551

dents not in normal courses. The amount received from productive funds by 15 
schools was $67,853. It is probable that the $406,601 reported by 49 schools as 
receipts from ‘‘ other sources and unclassified” came directly or indirectly from 
public funds. 
Tho value of buildings, grounds, and other property of 142 of the public normal 
schools reporting to this office in 1898-99 was $20,836,010. As shown in Table 6, 
the number of volumes reported in the libraries of 148 of these schools was 591,728, 
valued at $649,293. Five schools received during the year benefactions amount- 
ing to $141,278. Ten schools have endowments aggregating $1,886,529. The 
aggregate of public appropriations for buildings and improvements received by 
42 schools was $560,896. 
Table 7 shows the amount of public appropriations received each year for the 
last six years by the public normal schools for support, while Table 8 shows the 
_ public appropriations for buildings and improvements in the same period. The 
following table shows the aggregates of these appropriations for each year since

PRIVATE NORMAL SCHOOLS, 
The number of private normal schools reporting to this office varies from year 
to year. There was a falling off of 13 in the number of schools from 1898 to 1899, 
A few of the weaker ones went out of existence, while others continue as private 
secondary schools. The remaining schools were considerably strengthened, the 
165 reporting for 1898-99 having 2,279 more normal students than the 178 schools 
reporting for 1897-98. 
Table 9 shows that the 165 schools had 1,036 teachers for normal students, an 
increase of 28 over the previous year. The number of teachers wholly for other 
departments was 687, a decrease of 49 from the preceding year. 
Private normal schools are not reported from 16 States and Territories. Only 
10 such schools are credited to the North Atlantic Division, where there are 57 
public normal schools. In the North Central Division there are 72 private normal 
schools with 14,826 normal students, while the 41 public normal schools of that 
division have 16,325 normal students. The two Southern divisions have together 
79 private normal schools with 5,736 normal students, while the 51 public normal 
schools of that section have 7,066 normal students. 
From Table 10 it may be seen that 11,829 of the 23,572 normal students in the 
private normal schools were men and 11,743 were women. Of the total number 
14,826, or nearly 63 per cent, are in the North Atlantic Division. 
The total enrollment in the private normal schools was 50,836, including 5,749 
in business courses, 8,191 in secondary grades, and 13,324 in elementary grades. 
It is shown in Table 11 that there were 2,140 colored students in the normal depart- 
ments, nearly all being in private normal schools for the colored race in the two 
Southern divisions. : 
The number of graduates from teachers’ training courses was 2,227, as shown in 
Table 12, the number of men being 1,129 and the number of women 1,098. There 
were 1,629 graduates from business courses and 1,250 from other courses.

    1792 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
Table 13 shows that 28 private normal schools received State, county, or city aid 
aggregating $24,823, The tuition fees of 105 schools amounted to $590,402, while 
14 schools received $47,997 from productive funds. The aggregate income of 118 
schools was $921,473. 
The value of grounds, buildings, and other property owned by 138 private nor- 
mal schools was reported as $5,831,785, and 28 schools possessed endowments to 
the value of $2,508,744, as shown in Table 14. During the year 24 schools received. 
benefactions amounting to $423,755. The libraries of 123 schools had 206,893 vol- 
umes, valued at $181,573, 
DISTRIBUTION OF NORMAL STUDENTS. 
It is shown in Table 15 that nearly 26 per cent of the normal students in public 
normal schools were men and over 74 per cent were women, while in the private 
normal schools the number of normal students was almost equally divided between 
the sexes. Nearly 20 per cent of the normal students attending public normal 
schools in 1898-99 graduated, while in the private normal schools less than 10 per 
cent graduated. 
The namber of students pursuing teachers’ training courses in universities and 
colleges, in public high schoo!s, and in private high schools and academies is sum- 
marized by States in Table 16. Table 17 is a summary of all the students in the 
five classes of institutions reported to this office as pursuing normal or teachers’ 
training courses in 1898-99. 
Table 18 contains a list of the universities and colleges in which courses designed 
for the professional training of teachers are maintained. The number of normal 
students for each year for the past six yearsis given, Institutions which are public 
are so designated.

CHAPTER XLI. 
STATISTICS OF SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
The total enrollment in the schools and colleges of the United States for the 
scholastic year ending June, 1899, was 16,738,362. Of this number the secondary 
students comprised nearly 4 per cent, or 655,227. This was a gain of 29,112 over 
the preceding year. The secondary students enumerated were distributed among 
eight classes of institutions, as follows:

Tn localities in most of the States where high schools are not accessible there are 
many students pursuing secondary studies under the direction of teachers of the 
elementary schools. These students and others not reported may number nearly 
20,000. Including this number, the total enrollment of secondary students for 
the scholastic year 1898-99 was not less than 675,000. This does not include the 
students enrolled in commercial schools or city evening schools. 
This chapter is devoted almost exclusively to the statistics of the 5,495 public 
high schools and the 1,957 private high schools, academies, and seminaries report- 
ing directly to this Bureau for the year 1898-99. The following table shows the 
remarkable growth of public and private high schools for the past ten years:

  The increase in the number of public high schools since 1889 is one of the most 
remarkable facts in the educational history of the decade. In 1889-90 there were 
2,526 public high schools and 202,963 students, while in 1898-99 the number had 
reached 5,495 schools, with 476,227 students. This was an increase of 117 per cent | 
in the number of schools and 135 per cent in the number of secondary students.

  S44 ey EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
Up to the middle of the decade there was an increase in the number of private 
high schools and academies, but since 1895 there has been a small decrease 
annually. 
In 1889-90 the public high schools had about 68 per cent of the number of stu- 
dents and the private high schools about 32 per cent, while in 1898-99 the former 
had over 82 per cent and the latter nearly 18 per cent of the secondary students. 
The relative progress of public and private high schoo!s for the past ten years is 
shown in the following table, which gives the proportion of the number of schools, 
teachers, and students of the two classes:

SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 1845 
Prior to 1880 the nuinber of students reported by a large number of private high 
schools included the whole number in attendance, the elementary pupils as well 
as the secondary students. In the above table the statistics for the years from 
1871 to 1889 have been carefully corrected upon the basis of the reports for later 
years, eliminating the pupils below the high school grades. 
Pusiic Hien ScHoors. 
Tables 1 to 15 in this chapter summarize the statistics of the public high schools 
reporting to this Office, while the information concerning each school is given in 
detail in Table 42. Tables 16 to 29 relate to private secondary schools, while 
Tables 30 to 88 exhibit the combined statistics of public and private secondary 
schools. Tables 39 and 40 show the distribution of secondary students by States 
in the various classes of institutions. 
For the scholastic year 1898-99 there were 5,495 public high schocls reporting to 
this Office, a gain of 180 over the preceding year. The number of these schools 
reported as departments of public school systems was 5,017, while only 478 were 
reported as independent. These are generally outside the cities or villages. Of 
the number belonging to city or village systems 731 are in cities which have 8,000 
population or over. 
As shown in Table 1 there were 18,718 teachers instructing secondary students 
in the public high schools, the number of men being 9,239 and the number of 
women 9,479. This was an increase of 777 in the number of teachers over the 
preceding year. 
It is shown in the same table that the public high schools had 476,227 secondary 
students, 197,127 males and 279,100 females, a gain of 26,627 in the total number. 
The male students comprised 41.39 per cent of the whole number and the female 
students 58.61 per cent. 5 
Of the total number of students in the public high schools of the United States, 
239,061, or more than 50 per cent, are found in the 2,916 schools of the North Cen- 
tral Division. The 1,342 public high schools of the North Atlantic division had 
150,683 secondary students, the 598 schools of the South Central had 35,632, the 405 
schools of the South Atlantic had 25,684, and the 233 schools of the Western Division 
had 25,167 secondary students. 
In the total number of students reported there were included 7,117 colored 
secondary students. Of this number only 3,352 were in the colored high schools 
of the two Southern divisions, while the other divisions had 3,765. In the colored 
high schools of Missouri, a former slave State, there were 685 secondary students. 
If this number be subtracted from the North Central Division and added to the 
total in the two Southern divisions the number would be 4,037 for the Southern 
and 3,080 for the other sections of the United States.- 
  STUDENTS AND COURSES OF STUDY. 
The number of secondary students in classical and scientific courses known to be 
preparing for college, the number of graduates in 1899, the number of college 
preparatory students in the graduating classes, and the number of public high- 
school students in military drill are shown in Table 2. Thenumber preparing for 
college was 54,794, or 11.51 per cent of the whole number. The number of grad- 
uates was 56,468, or 11.86 per cent of the total enrollment. The number of gradu- 
ates prepared for college was 16,298, or 28.85 per cent of the total number of 
graduates for the year. The number of students in military drill was 10,396, an 
increase of 1,364 over the preceding year. 
The table which follows is a synopsis of the summaries exhibited in Tables 2 to 
411. The per cent of male students preparing for college was 14.39, and the per

The above table shows that there were 239,981 public high-school students study- 
ing Latin, or 50.39 per cent of the whole number. It may be considered as re- 
markable that a greater proportion of female than male students were studying 
Latin. There were 93,741, or 47.55 per cent, of the male students and 146,240, or 
52.40 per cent, of the female students in Latin. Only 4.08 percent of the male stu- 
dents and 2.44 per cent of the female students were studying Greek. The per cent 
of male students studying algebra was 58.15, and the per cent of female students 
in the same study was 56.35. The total number studying algebra was 271,889, or 
more than 57 per cent of the total public high-school enrollment. The numbers 
and percentages of the other leading high-school studies are given in the above 
table for the United States, and for the Siates in detail in Tables 3 to 11. 
As shown in Table 3, Latin was taught in 4,706 of the 5,495 public high schools. 
This was an increase of 218 in the number of schools in which Latin was taught. 
The number of students was 16,674 more than the preceding year. 
The per cent of students in each of theleading high-school studies reported annu- 
ally for the past ten years is given in the table which follows. It will be noted 
that the per cent of students in Latin has increased from 84,69 in 1889-90 to 50.39 
in 1898-99. In the same period the per cent in algebra increased from 45.40 to 
57.09, the per cent in German from 10.51 to 14.01, and the per cent in general 
history from 27.31 to 38.32. The proportion of students in Greek has remained at 
a fraction above 3 per cent for ten years.

Although the actual number of students reported as preparing for college has 
increased each year, there has been a falling off in the percentage in the last ten 
years. In 1889-90 the per cent of public high-school students preparing for college 
was 14.44 and in 1898-99 only 11.51. 
Tables 12, 13, and 14 compare the statistics of public high schools in cities and 
outside of cities. In cities of 8,000 population and over there were 731 public high 
schools, with 7,563 instructors and 224,686 students. Outside of these cities there 
were 4,764 public high schools, with 11,155 instructors and 251,541 students. In 
the cities the high schools had an average of 307 students to the school, while the 
average outside of the cities was 53 students to a school. 
  EQUIPMEN 
  AND INCOME, 
The equipment and income of the public high schools in each State may be 
found ‘summarized in Table 15, so far as the items were reported to this Office. 
The number of volumes in the libraries of 4,537 schools was 2,618,445; the va’ue 
of grounds, buildings, scientific apparatus, etc., owned by 4,430 schools was 
$89,096,912. Owing to the fact that in most cases separate accounts are not kept 
of the proportion of public appropriations used by the high schools, only 1,905 of 
these schools were able to report the amounts of State or municipal aid received. 
The aggregate of these amounts was $4,700,762, The aggregate received from 
tuition by 1,580 schools was $514,489. The amount received by 722 schools from 
sources reported as unclassified was $1,862,561. Nearly all of the latter item 
should be credited to State, county, or city appropriations. The total income of 
2,102 schools reporting this item was $6,769,213,

PrivaTE HIGH SCHOOLS AND ACADEMIES. 
Tables 16 to 29 summarize the statistics of private high schools, academies, and 
seminaries. Tables 16 to 26 are similar in form to Tables 1 to 11, relating to pub- 
lic high schools, and the two series may be compared. Tables 27 and 15 may also 
be compared. Table 80 is a comparative showing of the average numbers of 
teachers and students in public and private high schools. 
For the year 1898-99 there were 1,957 private secondary schools reporting to this 
Office, or 83 less than the number reporting the previous year. These schools had 
9,410 teachers for secondary students, an increase of 53, and 103,838 secondary 
students, a decrease of 1,887. The total number of private secondary students 
included 2,956 colored students—2,645 in private colored schools in the two south- 
ern divisions and 311 in the other divisions. The 1,957 schools reported 118,050 in 
the elementary grades. : 
STUDENTS AND COURSES OF STUDY. 
In the private secondary schools there were 26,714 students preparing for college, 
or nearly 26 per cent of the number enrolled. As shown in Table 17, the number 
of these college preparatory students preparing for the classical course was 16,613 
and the number preparing for scientific courses 10,101. The number of graduates 
in 1899 was 11,862, or more than 11 per cent of the secondary students enrolled. 
In the classes that graduated there were 5,309 students prepared for college, or 
nearly 45 per cent of the graduates. There were 8,459 students in military drill, 
an increase of 605 over the preceding year. 
The number of students in each of 18 high-school studies in each State will be 
found in Tables 18 to 23, while the percentages of students in these studies are 
shown in Tables 24, 25, and 26. The following table gives a synopsis of the num.

An interesting comparison may be made with the above table and a similar 
synopsis on a preceding page relating to public high schools. It is shown that 
nearly 26 per cent of the private high-school students were preparing for college, 
while less than 12 per cent of the public high-school students were making such 
preparation. In both the public and private high schools about 50 per cent studied 
Latin. The per cent studying algebra in the private high schools was 52.17 and 
in the public high schools 57.09. -

The above table shows that in the private secondary schools the per cent of 
graduates has increased from 8.50 in 1830 to 11.42 in 1899, while the proportion of 
graduates prepared for college has decreased from 61.37 per cent in 1891 to 44.75 
per cent in 1899. Asin the case of public high schools, there has been a marked 
increase in the number of students in certain studies. The per cent studying 
Latin increased from 31.82 in 1889-90 to 49.80 in 1898-99, and the per cent in algebra 
from 37.12 in 1889-90 to 52.17 in 1898-99. In the public high schools it has been 
noted that a little more than 8 per cent of the students reported each year for ten 
years have been studying Greek. In the private high schools the percentage 
increased from 7.02 in 1889-90 to 10.43 in 1898-99. For the past year there was an 
unaccountable decrease to 9.55 per cent in the number studying Greek.

public funds received by 264 of these schools was $146,273. The tuition fees of 
1,130 schools aggregated $5,595,421, while 278 schools derived $1,654,112 from pro- 
ductive funds. Receipts from sources not named amounted to $1,032,859 for 440 
schoo's. The aggregate income of 1,242 schools was $3,428,665, During the year 
184 schools received benefactions amounting to $1,611,693. The total money value 
of the endowments of 353 schools is reported as $43,085,885. 
DENOMINATIONAL SCHOOLS. 
Of the 1,957 private secondary schools reported, 924 are controlled by religious 
denominations. In these denominational schools there were 4,637 instructors and 
49,798 secondary students, as against 4,637 instructors and 54,040 students in the 
1,033 nonsectarian schools. In Table 43, which gives in detail the statistics of 
private secondary schools, the name of the religious denomination controlling 
each school is given in column 4. Tables 23 and 29 show the number of schools 
in each State controlled by each religious denomination. The following synopsis

The statistical summaries of public and private secondary schools are combined 
in Tables 31 to,38. Table 80 presents a comparison of certain statistics. It is 
shown that in the public high schools there are about 87 students to a school and 
25 students to a teacher, while in the private schools there are 53 students toa 
school and only 11 secondary students to a teacher. Table 31 shows that the 7,452 
public and private secondary schools had 28,128 teachers and 580,065 students, 
Over 57 per cent, or 331,038, of these students were females. The number of stu- 
dents preparing for college was 81,508, or 14 per cent of the total secondary enroll- 
ment. The graduates for 1899 numbered 68,330, or nearly 12 per centfof the 
number enrolled for the year. The number of graduates who had prepared for 
college was 21,602, or nearly 82 per cent of the total number of graduates. 
Tables 33 to 38 give the number and per cent of students in each of the 18 lead- 
ing high-school studies in each State. The following synopsis shows the number 
of male and female students in certain courses and studies for the United States 
in 1898-99,

One of the most significant facts recorded by the high-school statistics of the 
past ten years has been the steady increase of the number of students in Latin. In 
1889-90 there were 100,152 students in public and private high schools studying 
Latin. This was 33.62 per cent of the total. In 1898-99 the number had increased 
to 291,695 or 51.29 per cent of the total number of secondary students in these 
schools. There has been but little variation in the percentage of students in 
Greek, the highest for any year being 4.99 and the lowest 4.27. There has been 
a small increase in the percentage in French. The number studying German 
increased from 11.48 per cent in 1889-90 to 14,91 in 1898-99, In the ten years the 
per cent of students in algebra increased from 42.77 to 56.21, and the per cent in 
geometry increased from 20.07 to 27.36. The percentage of students in general 
history increased from 27.83 in 1889-80 to 38.32 in 1898-99, The following synop- 
sis exhibits these percentages for each of the ten years:

DISTRIBUTION OF SECONDARY STUDENTS. 
Tables 39 and 40 show the distribution of secondary students enrolled in 1898-99 
in the eight classes of institutions mentioned on the first page of this chapter. It 
is shown that of the 655,227 secondary students reported to this Bureau for the 
scholastic year, 488,549 were in public institutions and 166,678 were in private 
institutions. In the public institutions 476,227 were in public high schools, 7,518 
in preparatory departments of public universities and colleges, and 4,804 in public 
normal schools. In the private institutions 103,838 were in private high schools 
and academies, 46,887 in preparatory departments of private universities and col- 
leges, 8,198 in private normal schools, and 7,762 in manual training schools. 
Table 41 shows that the number of secondary students to each 1,000 of popula- 
tion in the United States was 8.86. 
The same table shows that the number of students in higher education was 
147,164, or an average of 1.99 to the 1,000 of population. This number includes 
all students who in 1898-99 were receiving higher instruction in colleges, resident 
graduate students in universities and colleges, and all professional students in 
theology, medicine, andlaw. The independent professional schools are included, 
as well as those class:d as departments of universities and colleges. Students of 
normal schools and schools of dentistry, veterinary surgery, pharmacy, and nurse 
training are not here included. 
Tables 42 and 43 give in detail the statistics of the 7,452 public and private high 
schools reporting to this Bureau in 1898-99. Table 44 shows the number of public 
and private high schools for boys only, for girls only, and the number of coeduca- 
tional secondary schools in each State. -

  CHAPTER XLII. 
MANUAL AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 
References to recent Reports of the United States Commissioner of Education, in which this 
subject has been treated or statistics published: Annual Report for 1888-89, pages 411-428, 
1362-1367; 1889-90, pages 1148, 12 2, page 1197; 1892-93, pages 186-188, 569-

pages 141, 194, 723, 2370-2382 (column 8), 2419-2440. 
         
      
      
The number of manval or industrial training schools reporting statistics to this 
office for the school year 1898-99 was 125, an increase of 11 over the preceding 
year. This includes the 24 industrial schools for Indian children, 
The 125 schools have 1,077 teachers in the manual and industrial training 
departments, 548 men and women, as shown in Table 3, This was an increase 
of 132 in the number of teachers over the previous year. The number of pupils 
receiving manual! training in these schools was 38,621, an increase of 7,938. The 
number of boys receiving manual training was 23,002, an increase of 3,850, and 
the number of girls 15,619, an increase of 4,088, 
The total expenditure for manual training by 96 of the 125 schools was $913,450, 
as compared with $655,247 expended by 86 schools the year before. Of the aggre- 
gate-of expenditure for 1898-99 the sum of $676,478 was paid teachers, $98,807 for 
materials, $53,187 for new tools and repairs, and $84,978 for incidentais and for 
items not classified. 
The statistics in detail for the 101 manual and industrial training schools other 
than Indian schoois will be found in Table 4. In these 101 schools there were 
employed 815 teachers, 432 men and 383 women. In the same schools there were 
33,257 pupils, 19,926 boys and 13,331 girls. 
Table 5 gives in detail the statistics of the 24 Indian schools. There were 262 
teachers employed in these schools, 116 men and 146 women. Thenumber of 
pupi's was 5,364, the number of boys being 3,076 and girls 2,288. 
The branches of manual training or the trades taught and the number of pupils 
in each branch, so far as reported by the individual schools mentioned in Tables 
4 and 5, are shown in Table 6. 
This office did not attempt to ascertain the number of pupils receiving manual 
or industrial training in 1898-99 in institutions not distinctively manual or indus- 
trial training schools. General statistics of this character were collected in 
1893-94 and printed in the Report of this office for that year, pages 2098 to 2169. 
Table 1, on the next page, shows the number of cities of 8,000 population and 
over in whose public schools manual training has been given in the last ten years. 
In 1890 it was given in 37 cities, in 1894 in 95 cities, in 1896 in 121 cities, in 1898 in 
146 cities, and in 1899 in 170 cities. 
Table 2 gives a list of the 170 cities in whose public schools manual training 
(other than drawing) was given in 1898-99, and indicates the grades in each city 
system in which such instruction was given. :

CHAPTER XLIIL 
COMMERCIAL AND BUSINESS SCHOOLS. 
REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS 
EDUCATION OF THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION ON 
A COURSE OF STUDY FOR COMMERCIAL COLLEGES. 
THE CORRELATION OF STUDIES IN THE COMMERCIAL COURSE. 
The term correlation, as used in this report, your committee understands to 
refer not only to the co-relation of the studies in the commercial course, but also 
to the relation of the school to the office and to the relation of the training and 
conduct of the student in the school to the conditions he will meet in the business 
house in which he is to begin his career as a business man, it being deemed of the 
utmost importance that the step the student must take between the business 
school and the business office be made as short and easy as possible. 
Much assistance and information have keen received by this committee from 
the commercial school people not of the committee, and, in addition to this, the 
former reports of the proceedings of this body have been freely drawn upon, for 
all of which the members of this committee hereby render their acknowledgment 
and express their thanks. 
CORRELATION, 
Whatever else may be said of the business college curriculum, there are, per- 
haps, no other schools that possess a course of study the several branches of which 
are so unified and correlated. 
It has for its foundation bookkeeping, which requires a knowledge of arithme- 
tic, in order that the computation necessary to its conduct may be performed 
with accuracy and dispatch. 
The bookkeeper who does not know the legal rules governing business trans- 
actions and who does not understand the penalties for their violation would cer- 
tainly be unfit to manage the affairs of a modern business office. Therefore no 
one can lay claim to the title of bookkeeper, or, rather, accountant, in the true 
sense of the word without a reasonably accurate knowledge of commercial law; 
and thus we have a third element in the course. 
Purther, bookkeeping as an art depends largely upon good handwriting, and 
thus the fourth element in the course of study is brought into close connection 
with the three branches already named. 
Again, bookkeeping, as a record of business transactions, is closely allied to busi- 
ness correspondence, and the bookkeeper, as well as the correspondent, rejuires a 
knowledge of English, including grammar, spelling, and composition; thus these 
branches are intimately connected with the other subjects of the course. 
Since the introduction of the typewriter into the business house, no one having 
2163  
-P-A-G-E-924
    
2164 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
any considerable amount of correspondence can dispense with its use, and hence 
shorthand and typewriting have been added to the commercial course. 
As the work of the business correspondent and amanuensis requires accuracy 
and close discrimination, punctuation assumes the importance of a separate branch 
of study, and some knowledge, at least, of rhetoric becomes necessary. 
To enforce and fix in the student’s mind the principles of bookkeeping, and to 
assist in giving him a knowledge of business methods and customs, a course in 
business practice has been introduced. This feature of the course, in connection 
with intercommunication, or trading between colleges in different parts of the 
country, is an excellent introduction to commercial geography, another branch of 
study of great importance to the future business man. 
Inasmuch as the education of a business man is not complete without the ability 
to stand before his peers in public and express his views, public speaking becomes 
a branch of business training of no little importance. 
A knowledge of the laws relating to production, distribution, and consumption 
is necessary to an understanding of the facts of commerce in their true light and 
to a correct view of their relations to each other. A place for economics must, 
therefore, be found in the business course. 
Whether we regard the principal work of the business college to be the training 
of young men and women for positions in business houses, thereby opening the 
avenue of business life to them, or look beyond this work to broader fields of use- 
fulness, we must, through a series of lectures, if not in some more formal manner, 
strive to teach the elements of business ethics. 
Further, it is none the less our duty than that of other schools to prepare young 
men and women for intelligent citizenship; for this reason the subject of civil gov- 
ernment must be given a place in the curriculum of the business school. 
Your committee is aware that this outline will appear to many to be too com- 
prehensive. It is not claimed by your committee that these several branches of 
study shall be considered to be of equal importance; some of them may, and 
indeed must, be taught incidentally, but they all, none the less, belong to the edu- 
cation of the modern American business man.

SUGGESTIONS ON THE OUTLINE. 
TIME REQUIRED. 
The time mentioned under each topic in this outline is the probable time required, 
put it must be borne in mind that in commercial or business schools the qualifica- 
tions of students vary greatly, and their fitness for business life must be measured 
by their attainments and not by the time they have spent in school, 
The ability or power to do certain things neatly and accurately in a limited 
time alone decides the student’s qualifications, and he should be graduated when 
he can meet these requirements, regardless of the time he has spent in securing 
this attainment. 
EL 
  TARY BOOKKEEPING. 
Time, three hours (by hours is here meant periods of sixty minutes) daily for 
two months, exc"usive of the time spent on bookkeeping in business and office 
practice. 
As before stated, your committee assumes bookkeeping to constitute the basis 
of the commercial course. The student should begin the study of bookkeeping 
only when he writes sufficiently well, and can perform ordinary computations 
under the fundamental rules of arithmetic, including interest, with a reasonable 
degree of accuracy. It may be necessary, therefore, for the incoming student to 
pass through a preparatory course of study before entering upon the course here 
described. 
Bookkeeping should be taught individually. Drills and lectures may be given 
in classes, but each pupil should pursue the course in bookkeeping independently 
of other students, except in so far as is necessary to carry out a scheme of practice 
as hereinbefore mentioned, 
This plan of individual study has many advantages: 
First. The bright student is not he!d back by others who are slow, but is allowed 
to proceed as fast as he can do his work well. 
Second. The slow student is not pushed ahead of his ability by those who are 
more rapid in their work, but is allowed to understandingly master the work as 
he progresses. 
Third. This individual work in bookkeeping renders the course flexible; the 
student may devote all the time he can spare from other studies to this subject, 
and therefore may be always kept busy. Where this arrangement is made no 
student need be idle at any time, and as bookkeeping is the groundwork of the 
course of study, it is eminently fitting that it should be thus made the subject of 
special individual instruction. 
Special test exercises in this subject, illustrating various applications of the 
principles of bookkeeping and fixing, by review, the work the student has already 
gone over, may be given to advantage throughout the course. In these tests the 
student should be thrown upon his own resources, and he should satisfy both him- 
seif and his teacher as to his ability to work independently of aids of any kind. 
Here, as elsewhere, weekly class drills or oral quizzes are recommended as 
valuable in assisting to fix in the minds of students the principles underlying the 
subject taught. 
  BUSINESS PRACTICE AND ADVANCED BOOKKEEPING. 
Time: Three hours of sixty minutes, daily for six months, 
Before entering upon what is usually known as ‘business practice” pupils 
should have in some measure the qualifications that they would be required 
to possess before beginning actual work. These should include order, neatness,  
-P-A-G-E-926
    
2166 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
good penmanship, ete. In correspondence and business forms they should have 
a clear idea of the mechanical arrangement of a letter and a knowledge of the 
forms and uses of checks, notes, drafts, etc., with a fuir understanding of the use 
of the daybook, journal, ledger, cashbook, sales book, and bill book. They 
should be quick and apt in journalizing, and should have at least passed the test 
in the first division of arithmetic. 
Your committee will not undertake to designate what the course in business 
practice shall or shall not be, but takes the liberty of submitting the following 
propositions: 
First. As the course in business practice is especially designed to correlate the 
school work with the work of the office, the business transactions in the business- 
practice course should come to the student bookkeeper for record in the same way 
they come to the bookkeeper in the business house; and the business done by the 
student, and the transactions made and booked by him, should be done and 
recorded as nearly as possible as they would be done and recorded in a first-class 
business house. 
Second. The books, stationery, and appliances used in the school should be 
modern in form, well bound, of good material, well printed or engraved, and in 
every respect the equal, at least, of those found in use in business houses. Good 
books and stationery tend to the formation of habits of neatness and accuracy. 
Third. A reasonable variety of books should be used, in order that the student 
may, when going outof the business-practice department of the school, pass intothe 
actual work of the office without feeling that books of account are all fashioned alike, 
but he should rather go out with a fair degree of knowledge concerning various 
forms of books of account, especially those that may be considéred standard. 
But, on the other hand, this variety of forms should not be so great as to confuse 
and annoy the student. Whatever is undertaken should be well done. And 
here, as elsewhere, one thing done well is better than any number of things 
poorly or loosely done. 
Fourth. The student should remain a sufficient time in each office or subdi- 
vision of the business practice work to gain a fair knowledge of the detail of 
such office or employment. Your committee believes that a week in a bank, 
for instance, is almost futile, and tends rather to confuse the student than to 
make plain the principles and modes of modern banking. Not less than a 
month should be given to the actual work in the bank, and » proportionate timo 
should be spent in the other offices. Nothing should be attempted that can not 
be done thoroughly and well. 
Fifth. From the time assigned to bookkeeping and business practice in this 
report it will be seen that your committee believes that from two-thirds to three- 
fourths of the whole time given to bookkeeping in the ecnun Nene course should 
be devoted to this business-practice work. 
Sixth. Accuracy in this department should be insisted upon to the letter, and 
all the ‘‘checks” possible should be placed upon the student, that his work may 
be done thoroughly and accurately. All loose and haphazard work should be 
rewritten, and neatness and accuracy should be insisted upon. Let all this work 
be done under an experienced and competent supervisor. 
Seventh. The student in the business-practice department should be taught to 
conscientiously care for all original documents coming into his hands, to file let- 
ters and papers with care and accuracy, and to keep everything in and about his 
office neat, clean, and orderly 
Eighth. The strictest attention should be given to correspondence, and, as the 
intercommun cation work usually connected with this department gives rise toa 
large amount of correspondence, which, in the nature of things, no other plan can 
secure, the student should be made to profit by this opportunity to develop his 
ability to write a good business letter. All work in this line should be performed
-P-A-G-E-927
  
COMMERCIAL AND BUSINESS SCHOOLS. 2167 
with care and fidelity, and every letter and document written in this department 
should pass under the eye of acareful teacher, who should firmly decline to accept 
anything but reasonably good work. 
Ninth. A plain, easy, rapid style of business writing, without shade or flourish, 
should be taught in this department, and students not meeting a reasonable 
requirement in handwriting should be debarred from the work in bookkeepixg, 
and should receive special attention in penmanship until such a handwriting is 
acquired. A constant improvement in the student's handwriting during the 
whole course should be insisted upon. 
Tenth. Special attention should be given in this department to the art of book- 
keeping, such as indexing, the arrangement of accounts in the ledger, the proper 
manner of closing accounts, forwarding, etc.; the handling and care of books, the 
filing of papers, and every detail connected with office work. 
Eleventh. The stpdent should be taught to be exhaustive in the examination 
of statements and accounts; to check his books when balancing, even though 
they balance after the first addition; to check all statements received, and to care- 
fully go over a second time all statements rendered. He should be taught to 
examine and audit books, and should acquire the skill necessary to perforn these 
operations with reasonable dispatch. 
Twelfth. The order and discipline in this department should be that of a well- 
conducted modern office; communication between students should be allowed 
concerning the business in hand only. Necessary conversation should be carried 
on only in a low, soft tone of voice, and no unnecessary noise, heavy walking, or 
irregularities in deportment should be permitted. 
ARITHMETIC. 
Time: Five periods a week for six months. 
To facilitate coordination with bookkeeping, the work in arithmetic may be 
arranged in four divisions, as follows: 
First. The fundamental rules, United States money, factoring, common and 
decimal fractions, and denominate numbers. 
Second. Percentage, with its applications, profit and loss, discounts, commis- 
sion and brokerage, simple and compound interest, and partial payments. 
Third. Insurance, exchange, equation of accounts; and stocks and bonds. 
Fourth, Taxes, partnerships, national and savings banks, etc. 
Tests or examinations should be given as these parts of the arithmetic are 
severally completed, and the student’s progress in arithmetic should be made to 
keep pace with his advancement in bookkeeping. 
Rapid calculation should include addition, substraction, multiplication, exfen- 
sion, cancellation, and interest and discount, by sho t and rapid methods. 
‘‘Mental arithmetic,” whether formally or incidentally taught, should have a 
place in all arithmetic work. 
A brief practical course in mensuration should be given to all students in the 
business course, either in classes or as a general exercise. 
Tke metric system, longitude and time, marine and life insurance, foreign 
exchange, and general average may usually be cmitted; not becavise they aze not 
important, but because other more important subjects demand all the time that 
can be given to arithmetic in tese schools, It is urged by some teachers that the 
metric system should be taught, but, for the reason given, your committee suggests 
that it be omitted. 
Equation of payments should be performed by the ‘interest method,” in crder 
to afford additional practice in interest computations and to insure a rational 
view of the subject. 
The work in partnership settlements should be performed, as far as possibie, on 
      
 
-P-A-G-E-928
    
2168 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
paper ruled by the students in the form of statements, trial balances, etc. This 
work, done in such manner, tends to greatly inczease the student's efficiency in 
the practice of accounting. 
Students failing to pass the tests in arithmetic may proceed with their work and 
be given such tests again when time has been afforded them for review or private 
study, providing, however, that the student shal! not be allowed to advance in his 
bookkeeping beyond the point where such test in arithmetic is required to be 
passed, 
Your commiitee recommends the analytic method, and the avoidance of formulas 
of all kinds throughout the whole course in arithmetic. If it be thought best to 
use a formula, it should be thoroughly explained, that each student may fully 
understand the process upon which such formula is based. The fact that the 
arithmetic of business is preeminently the arithmetic of common sense should 
not for a moment be lost sight of in drilling classes in this branch in our schools. 
PENMANSHIP, 
Time: Five periods a week throughout the course. 
Your committee believes that nothing bat plain, practical business writing 
should be taught in these schools except to those taking a special course in orna- 
mental penmanship (and ornamental penmanship constitutes no part of a com- 
mercial course). A student whose writing is below a reasonable standard should 
be made to discontinue work in. bookkeeping until his writing is improved. Fig- 
ures should receive close attention, and students should be drilled in both their 
form and their rapid execution. Skill in accommodating writing to the space 
to be occupied should be carefully cultivated. An easy arm movement should 
be early acquired. Unnatural and unhealthful positions of the body should be 
guarded against. Every teacher in the school should give attention to the correc- 
tion of the writing of students as to position, movement, and form in the branches 
taught by him, and nothing but the best work of the student should be accepted 
anywhere. The student should be induced to write to the best of his ability 
always, and always in a correct position. 
No criticism upon the usual methods of teaching this branch is here intended, 
but it is the opinion of your committee that there is generally too much of oral 
explanation attempted by teachers of penmanship, an effort to hold the attention 
of pupils to extended and ininute descriptions of form, when the students are not 
prepared for such explanations. Asa rule but a few moments should be devoted 
to any explanation in this branch until the student has attempted to write the copy. 
After making such attempt his attention should be again called to the form for 
a short time, and he should again be a!lowed to attempt its reproduction. All 
Jong and tedious analysis should be avoided. Especially is this true concerning 
the teaching of those who are beginning the systematic study of penmanship. 
Persistent practice under careful direction is what is needed to produce good 
business penmanship. 
COMMERCIAL LAW, 
Time: Three periods a week for four months. 
It is the sense of your committee that commercial law should be taught as a 
regular class recitation. The student should be provided with a text-book and be 
required to prepare his lessons as in other branches. Lectures on law are valua- 
ble, but lectures should not be depended upon to the exclusion of regular text- 
book work. The application of business law to bookkeeping should be most care- 
fully enforced, and the student’s knowledge of business law should be carefully 
correlated with his work in business practice. While the teacher of this branch 
should be well acquainted not only with the facts in the book he is using, but be
-P-A-G-E-929
  
COMMERCIAL AND BUSINESS SCHOOLS. 2169 
well informed in law generally and acquainted with the rules of pleading and 
practice in the courts, it is by no means necessary that he should bea lawyer. 
Lawyers are often not teachers, and more often they are not disciplinarians, and 
when employed to teach commercial law in business colleges they are not likely 
to give sufficient attention to the order and discipline of their classes. For this 
reason what is gained in the direction of law is often lost or more than lost in 
other directions. . 
The common forms of legal and business documents shouid be exhibited in the 
classes as the subject of the lesson deals with them, and it is better to use forms 
that are now or have been used in the regular course of business. For instance, 
the policy of insurance, the protested bill, the deed, the mortgage, etc. 
An occasional ‘‘moot court,” judiciously conducted, may be made very useful 
in illustrating the practical details of lawsuits and the practice of law. Such 
“moot courts” must, however, be managed with the greatest care to prevent them 
degenerating into a mere amusement. 
CIVIL GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING CIVICS, 
Time: Two periods a week for four months. 
These subjects are sometimes taught in our schools incidentally and through 
lectures, but many schools use a text-book and do regular class work in these 
branches. Your committee recommends that these branches be taught formally, 
even if. they are made elective. No finishing school can afford to assume the busi- 
ness education of young men and women to be complete till they have acquired a 
reasonable knowledge of the methods by which our government is conducted and 
have also a fair comprehension of the rights and duties of citizenship. 
ECONOMICS. 
Time: Two periods a week for three months. 
The subject of economics should find a place in schools devoted to the training 
of young men and women for business life. However this branch may be taught, 
its teaching should so impress the student that he will desire to continue reading 
and thinking on the subject. 
SPELLING. 
Time: Three to five periods a week till excused by meeting the requirements. 
The following is a very excellent method of teaching spelling: 
The pupil studies fifty words from a text-book on spelling; the teacher pro- 
nounces these, and the student writes them in a blank book kept for that purpose. 
When this is done the misspeiled words are checked by the students as they are 
spelled by the teacher. The words checked are immediately afterwards written 
correctly by the student on a separate slip of paper. At the opening of the next 
lesson they are copied from this slip into the back of his blank speller. But 
whatever method may be used, no student should be graduated from any course 
in our schools who has not attained a reasonable degree of proficiency in this 
branch. The passing grade should not be less than 95 per cent in the shorthand 
course and 90 per cent in the commercial course, but students should not be 
excused from spelling until they reach a grade of 95 per cent. All misspelled 
words in any work the student may do should be marked by the teacher and 
corrected by the student by rewriting. 
GRAMMAR. 
Time: Three periods a week for four months, 
Grammar should be taught with a view to the correction of errors in speech 
and writing. The subtleties of the subject may well be avoided, but much that 
   
-P-A-G-E-930
    2170 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
is usually termed ‘‘technical grammar,” but which is necessary to the under- 
standing of our language, should be carefully taught and persistently drilled upon. 
The test of all instruction should be, ‘‘ Will it aid the student in the construction 
of the English sentence?” Blunders should not be allowed to pass without cor- 
rection, either in class recitations, written exercises, or ordinary conversation, 
and all papers containing inaccuracies in language should be corrected and 
rewritten., Care must be taken and tact used that the spontaneity of students be 
not suppressed by this work, 
It has been suggested that the student should learn grammar by copying rules, 
etc., on the typewriter, but while the typewriter is an important aid in the 
srovement of language, nothing but careful, formal instruction, persistent and 
regular, can be depended upon to secure good results in the teaching of this 
sub;ect. 
  BUSINESS CORRESPONDENCE, 
Time: Two periods a week for four months. 
Business correspondence should receive most careful attention: 
(1) As to mechanical arrangement. (2) As tostyle. A text-book on this sub- 
ject should be used, and, in addition to the work of the text-book, many letters 
should be written by the student, criticised by the teacher, and returned to be 
rewritten, if deemed necessary. The letters of the entire class should be read in 
the class, signatures omitted, and comments and criticisms should be made upon 
them by the class and the teacher, applying the principles of grammar and rhet- 
oric to their correction where those principles have been violated. Such work 
affords excellent additional drill in composition and rhetoric, but this work should 
not be relied on exclusively for instruction in those subjects. A good collection 
of business letters from good business houses may be profitably used in this work 
to inspire and encourage students to excellence in letter writing. 
COMPOSITION, 
Time: Two periods a week throughout the course, 
Composition should receive attention in an incidental way through every paper 
in school. Not less than twice each week every student in the school should sub- 
mit to his teacher in this branch a paper in his own language of not less than one 
page in length of ordinary letter paper. The teacher should correct this paper 
with reference to grammar, spelling, arrangement, etc., or rather suggest the cor- 
rection with red ink, and return the paper for the student’s examination and 
correction. If thought necessary, it should be rewritten. 
As much instruction on various topics must be given in the form of lectures, 
abstracts of these lectures should be written by the student, and when criticised 
by the teacher, they form the best means for the composition work mentioned. 
RHETORIC. 
Time: Two periods a week throughout the course. 
This branch, with few exceptions, must be taught incidentally in our schools; 
but nevertheless it may be well taught, and that, too, without consuming much 
time. 
PUBLIC SPEAKING. 
Time: One period a week throughout the course. 
Students should receive, through lectures and familiar talks, instruction in 
public speaking and should be required to take part in exercises that will give 
them opportunity for practical training. Every student should be required to 
stand while reciting and to clothe his thoughts in the best language he can com- 
mand, This alone will aid him greatly in the art of public speaking. It is a very
-P-A-G-E-931
  COMMERCIAL AND BUSINESS SCHOOLS. 2171 
important thing that men and women of affairs should be able to appear to 
advantage when presenting their business, and public speaking is one of the best 
means to acquire this ease and grace of manner. Students should be encouraged 
to form societies for practice in public debating and parliamentary practice, and 
to take part in them. 
BUSINESS METHODS AND CUSTOMS. 
Time: Two lectures a week throughout the course. 
In addition to the work done in this line in the practice department, business 
methods and customs should be taught through lectures and familiar talks. An 
important feature in connection with this instruction as well as in commercial 
law, and a very interesting one, is the use of original documents in connection 
with the subject, such as the freight receipt and bill of lading in shipping, the 
deposit slip, check, and draft in banking, etc. In addition to such methods of 
giving instruction on these subjects, the various departments of arithmetic and 
commercial law afford a most excellent opportunity to acquaint students with 
the methods adopted and employed in the conduct of business. 
The history of commerce will occupy a place under this head, as, for the pres- 
ent at least, it must be taught through lectures. 
COMMERCIAL GEOGRAPHY, 
Time: Two periods a week for three months. 
This branch may be taught through lectures and general exercises, though your 
committee advises that, where possible, it be taught formally in classes, There 
is no subject connected with commerce more interesting than this. Just now the 
acquisition of islands by our Government, the extension of our trade, the compe- 
tition between our Gulf and Eastern ports, and many other matters of commer- 
cial interest are attracting the attention of the business men of the entire country, 
and the teacher who reads and thinks will not want for material to make this sub- 
ject attractive. 
    SHORTHAND CouURSE. 
SHORTHAND STUDY. 
Time: Five periods a week for eight months. 
Each lesson in shorthand should be thoroughly understood by the pupil before 
advancing to the next. The principles contained in the lesson should be fixed 
upon the m’ of the student by reading exercises illustrative thereof. Such exer- 
cises should be copied by the student with the greatest accuracy a sufficient num- 
ber of times to enabie him to commit not only the matter but the shorthand 
characters contained therein tomemory. It is suggested that not less than ten 
times is usually sufficient. The exercises should then be read to the student at an 
increasing speed until he has reached the limit of his ability to make good notes; 
illegible characters should never be allowed under any circumstances. Accuracy 
and not speed is the great desideratuim in early work in shorthand. 
  READING SHORTHAND NOTES. 
The student should never be permitted to write anything in shorthand which 
he does not thereafter read; and should read each exercise often enough to enable 
him to give fluency and expression to the reading. He should not be permitted to 
hesitate over his notes, but should translate them at once with good expression 
and in a clear tone. 
SPEED WORK. 
The student should not be allowed to use any new matter, for speed or other 
work, until the text-book has been mastered. But the speed work outlines under 
   
-P-A-G-E-932
    2172 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
“Shorthand study” should be carried through to the end of the book. The 
‘“‘writing exercises” should be translated into shorthand by the student, and, 
when they have been ¢ sted by the teacher, should be used the same as the 
“‘yeading exercises” spoken of under the head last mentioned. 
  DICTATION, 
Time: Throughout the course. 
The students should be arranged in couples or groups, in each of which the 
students will have as nearly as possible the same speed ability. A selection should 
bo given to the group, and they should read it around, turn about. When it is 
read, the reader should call upon the one to the left to read his notes, and at the 
very first error made the reader should call ‘‘next.” If the next does not at once 
respond, ‘‘ next” should be again called, and so ou, until some one corrects the 
error made by the first one who read, and proceeds. If no one reads, the reader 
should correct the error and proceed as before. When the matter has been read 
back correctly, the one to the left becomes the reader and proceeds as before; and 
so on, reund and round, until all have the maiter by heart, and the notes as well. 
Then another selection shou!d be given them, and the work shou’d proceed as 
before. 
The matter used in these groups should be engraved matter furnished by the 
author of the text-book or by the teacher, and before it is used in the groups it 
should have been copied by each member of the group in the manner outlined 
under ‘Shorthand study.” 
No new matter should be used until each member of a group has reached a speed 
of at least 150 words per minute upon the copied matter. 
Note: By ‘‘new matter” is meant that which the student has not copied and as 
to which he forms the outlines upon his own responsibility as it is being read to 
him. 
        
SHORTHAND TESTS, 
Your committee would recommend the following tests: 
First, to write 300 words in three minutes and read it back without a mistake in 
the same length of time. 
Second, to write 800 words in three minutes and make a transcript of the same 
on the typewriter in thirty minutes. 
Third, to write 300 words in three minutes and make a transcript of the same 
on the typewriter in twenty minutes, 
TYPEWRITING. 
Time: Five periods a week for six months. 
The student should complete some good typewriting manual, containing, in 
addition to the usual drill for fingering, etc., all the ordinary business and legal 
forms in common use, and hand each lesson to the teacher without an error or 
erasure. After completing the manual, from five to ten pages of typewritten 
matter should be handed to the teacher daily for correction. The typewriter 
manual having been completed and the foundation for accuracy laid, the student 
should copy from new matter a stated number of words per minute, and upon 
reaching the required speed, dictation should be given direct to the machine, and 
letters should be taken in shorthand and transcribed upon the typewriter. He 
should be required to arrange and tabulate figures in statements and to correct 
and improve matter from ‘‘rough draft” where the matter is poorly arranged and 
improperly tabulated. 5 
TYPEWRITING TESTS. 
  Your committee would recommend the following tests: 
First, to copy from manuscript at the rate of 30 words per minute for three 
 
-P-A-G-E-933
  
COMMERCIAL AND BUSINESS SCHOOLS. 21738 
minutes, returning a neat, accurate page, free from erasures or letters struck over 
each other. 
Second, to copy manuscript at the rate of 35 words per minute for three minutes, 
Third, to write from dictation at the rate of 45 words per minute for three 
minutes, 
  COLLATERAL BRANCHES. 
  Penmanship, spelling, grammar and punctuation, composition and rhetoric, and 
rapid calculations, as recommended for the student of the commercial course, with 
equal proficiency therein, are absolutely necessary for the graduate of the short- 
hand course. Especially should all the branches necessary to give the student a 
good understanding of the English language receive the closest attention in all 
cases where such student is not well qualified in English before entering on the 
study of shorthand. In the latter case, such students should pass the test in 
grammar before being excused from the study of this branch. 
        BOOKKEEPING, 
At least such a knowledge of bookkeeping as will enable the student to act as 
assistant bookkeeper is recommended to be required of all taking this course. 
OTE 
  In addition to the tests in shorthand and typewriting, students should be 
required before graduating to pass examinations in grammar and punctuation 
with grades of not less than 85 per cent, and to correctly spe!l at least 95 reason- 
ably difficult common words out of a possibie 100. Daily drills in penmanship 
and rapid calcu’ation should be given from the time the student enters until he 
leaves the school, 
    
GENERAL REMARKS. 
ARRANGEMENT OF CLAS 
  S$, TIME, TERMS, ETC., OF SCHOOL, 
As most commercial schools in this country continue in session throughout the 
entire year, admit students at any time, and teach bookkeeping, at least individ- 
ually, but little can be profitably said in this report concerning the above-named 
subjects, These matters must be left to the management of the individual 
schoo-s as their needs seem apparent. 
   PROGRAMMES, 
It must not be forgotten that (unlike the public schools, where students usually 
enter at the beginning of a term and continue throughout the course) in com- 
mercial schools students are coming and going constantly; some for a month's 
instruction only, others for two, many for three, and some fora fu!l course. It 
would seem, therefore, useless to give in this report any outlines even of pro- 
grammes, arrangement of studies, or order of classes, further than to say ihat 
all work should be done by schedule and all classes called and dismissed regularly 
and promptly. | 
LIBRARIES, MAGAZIN 
It is pertinent to suggest that all schools should contain libraries for the use of 
students, and the commercial school is no exception to the rule. Students, in 
addition to the use of the library, should be urged to subscribe for and read some 
of the best periodicals published on the subjects they are studying. ETC.

STATISTICS OF COMMERCIAL AND BUSINESS SCHOOLS. . 
There are 2,350 institutions of various grades in the United States in which there 
were 131,518 students reported as pursuing commercial or business studies in the 
scholastic year 1898-99. The number of each class of institution and the number 
of business and commercial students in each of the five classes is shown in the 
following summary:

  The number of students in exch State pursuing business or commercial studies 
in the five classes of institutions named above will be found in Table 6. 
Table 1 gives the number of commercial siudents in universities and colleges in 
each State. Tho same table shows the number of such students in public and 
private normal schools in each State. 
Table 2 summarizes by States the number of business and commercial students 
in private high schools and academies. The number of such students in the public 
high schools in each State is given in the same table. 
Table 8 is the first of a series of three tables summarizing the statistics of the 820 
commercial and business schools reporting to this office for 1898-99. These schools 
employed 1,781 instructors—1,196 men and 585 women. Of the 70,186 students 
enrolled, there were 46,421 males and 23,765 females. Many of these institutions 
haye both day and evening schools. The number of students enrolled in the day 
schools was 56,109, the number of males being 36,185, fema’es 19,924, The number 
of students in the evening schools of these institutions, and not attending any 
of the day schools, was 12,071, the number of males being 8,679, females 3,392, as 
shown in Table 4. A number o* the schools reported only total enroliment, with- 
out dividing day and evening attendance. 
Table 4 shows that the 8320 commercial and business schools had 8,449 graduates 
from commercial courses and 7,755 graduates from amanuensis courses during the 
year 1898-99. 
The number of students in each of four courses of study in each State as 
reported by the 320 business and commercial schools is shown in Table 5. The

The total enrollment in the public schools of the South (the 16 former save 
tates and the District of Columbia) for the year 1898-99 was 5,662,259, the num- 
ber of white children being 4,150,641 and the number of negro children 1,511,618. 
Tabie 1 of this chapter shows that the estimated number of children in the South 
between 5 and 18 years of age was 8,867,310. Of this number 5,954,400, or 67 per 
cent, were white children and 2,912,910, or 38 per cent, were children of the negro 
race. The same tab’e shows that 69.71 per cent of the white school population 
was enrolled in the schools and 51.89 per cent of the negroschool population. The 
average daily attendance in the white schools was 2,669,903, or 64.32 per cent of 
the white enrollment, and the average daily attendance in the negro schools was 
96.,911, or 64.10 per cent of the colored enroliment. 
The total expenditure for the public schools of the South for the year 1898-99 
was $32,849,892, as shown in Table 2. It is estimated that about 20 per cen’ of 
this sum, or $6,569,978, was expended to sustain the negro schools. Tables pre- 
senting estimates of school expenditures in the South for the last thirty years, 
class fied by race, are given on pages LXXXVIII to XCII of the introduction to 
this Annual Report.

CHAPTER XLV. 
STATISTICS OF REFORM SCHOOLS. 
Reports received from the individual reform schools for the year 1898-99 indi- 
cate general improvement and progress in this class of industrial training schools. 
Wherever tried the cottage system has been successful. Under this system it is 
possible to do more individual work and to separate the better class from the more 
vicious. It also approaches more nearly healthful home conditions than any other 
system. 
The number of schools reporting was 82; instructors employed, 578; pupils 
attending school, 22,692, and 14,673 in industrial departments. The total number 
of inmates was 24,925. The value of grounds and buildings was $18,873,587. The 
expenditures on buildings and grounds amounted to $605,010; for salaries and 
other expenses, $2,800,281, making a total expenditure of $3,405,291. The number 
of assistants, not including instructors in school departments, was 1,788. There 
were 16,699 white inmates and 2,784 colored inmates; 8,514 were of native parents 
and 4,122 of foreign-born parents. Those that could only read when admitted 
were 2,207, and 1,595 could neither read nor write. 
The number committed to the institutions during the year was 11,676 and the 
number discharged 11,990. When discharged from the schools many of the pupils 
possessed a trade and were provided for in good homes; all could read and write; 
the majority had received the equivalent of a common school education. 
The North Atlantic Division reports 33 schools, 299 instructors, 11,550 pupils in 
school departments, and 9,282 in industrial departments. The number of inmates 
reported was 11,767, of which number 9,282 were males and 2,485 females. The 
value of grounds and buildings was $9,922,733. The expenditures on grounds and 
buildings amounted to $200,983; for salaries and other expenses, $1,311,832, mak- 
ing a total expenditure of $1,512,815. 
The South Atlantic Division reports 11 schools, 57 instructors, 1,898 pupils in 
school departments, and 925 in the industrial departments. Of the 1,909 inmates 
reported, 1,679 were males and 230 females. The total value of grounds and build- 
ings was $1,195,097. The amount expended for buildings and improvements was 
$17,419; for salaries and other expenses, $161,792, making a total expenditure of 
$179,211. 
The South Central Division reports 5 schools, 29 instructors, 1,549 pupils in 
school departments, and 441 in industrial departments; total number of inmates, 
1,694. Of this number, 1,110 are males and 584 females. The value of grounds 
and buildings was $472,000. The total amount expended was $187,148—for build- 
ings and improvements, $27,241, and for salaries and other expenses, $159,907. 
The North Central Division reports 28 schools, 184 instructors, and 7,164 pupils 
in school departments, and 6,205 in industrial departments. The total number of 
inmates reported was 9,164, of which number 6,729 were males and 2,435 females. 
The value of grounds and buildings was $6,738,019. The amount expended was 
$1,380,117—for buildings and improvements, $353,367, and for salaries and other 
expenses, $1,026,750. 
The Western Division reports 5 schools, 9 instructors, and 531 pupils in school 
departments, and 446 in industrial. The value of grounds and buildings was 
$545,738. The amount expended was $146,000—for buildings and improvements,

CHAPTER. XLVI. 
SCHOOLS FOR THE DEFECTIVE CLASSES. 
Schools for the blind.—It is gratifying to note in most of the institutions for the 
education of the blind in this country the effort to secure for the blind the means 
of a broader intellectual foundation, a greater development of the inner forces of 
thought, feeling, and action, a greater power of self-reliance and self-direction. 
As now conducted the kindergarten and elementary schools lay a firm foundation 
for their physical, mental, moral, social, and esthetic development. This, followed 
by a high or preparatory school complete in its departments for physical and man- 
ual training as well as for literary, scientific, and musical studies, will fully equip 
them to enter colleges and universities and conservatories of music. There, in 
company with the seeing pupils, the blind may pursue almost any branch of 
knowledge, thus enabling them to enter many spheres of usefulness, not confining 
them to the field of manual labor that is now practically closed to them on account 
of the extensive employment of machinery. 
The total number of schools reported was 36; number of instructors, 393—male 
187, and 256 female; in music, 127, and in the industrial departmers, 122. The 
total number of pupils reported was 3,665—male 1,898, female 1,767; in the kinder- 
garten, 417; in vocal music, 1,738; in instrumental music, 1,797. In the industrial 
department were reported 1,924. The total number of volumes in the libraries 
was 93,262. The value of scientific instruments was $100,610 and the value of 
grounds and buildings $6,334,307. The total expenditure was $1,065,437. 
Schools for the deaf.—There are represented in this report 104 schools for the 
deaf, with 1,158 instructors and 10,923 pupils. The 57 State public schools report 
1,007 instructors—males 362 and females 645; in articulation, 381; aural develop- 
ment, 31; in industrial department, 280. The total number of pupils, 9,890, of 
which number 3,623 were taught by the combined system, 3,301 by the purely oral 
method, and 3,169 by the manual method; 696 were taught in the kindergartens, 
The number of graduates was 246. The libraries of these institutions contained 
95,229 volumes. The value of scientific apparatus was $14,420; of grounds and 
buildings, $11,849,054. The total expenditures amounted to $1,999,767. 
The 18 private schools for the deaf report 72 instructors—42 in articulation, 8 in 
aural development, and 24 in the industrial department. The number of pup'ls 
reported was 439, of which number 256 were taught by the combined system, 141 
by the purely oral method, and 37 by the manual method; 47 were taught in the 
kindergartens. There were 32 graduates. 
The public day schools for the deaf reported 79 instructors—37 in articulation, 
25 in aural development, and 32 in industrial departments. The number of pupils 
reported was 594, of which number 110 were taught by the combined system, 324 
by the purely oral method, 9 by the manual method. The number taught in the 
kindergartens was 31. There were 13 graduates.

2236 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
The first oral school in America for the deaf was established in 1867. It then 
met with very little favor. Since 1891 the system has grown with wonderful 
rapidity, and is now followed in all the leading schools of the country. Again the 
kindergarten supplies the means to the end in oral training. The early formation 
of the habit of looking to the lips rather than to the hands for information is the 
first step toward the acquisition of speech. Manual training in schools for the 
deaf occupies an important place. While it is not trade teaching, it prepares 
pupils for the selection of atrade; and ‘‘asa trained mind is the best preparation 
for the study of a profession, so are the trained hand and trained eye the best 
preparation for the successful acquisition of a trade.” 
The South gives evidence of gratifying progress in deaf-mute education. The 
schools of Georgia and Texas have grown from log cabins to elegant buildings. 
The deaf school buildings of Georgia are valued at $75,000 and those of Texas 
at $337,500. 
Schools for the feeble-minded.—The number of schools reported was 29, with 
281 instructors in the school departments, 236 in industrial departments, and 675 
assistants in caring for the inmates. Thenumber of pupils reported was 9,542, of 
which number 973 were instructed in the kindergarten and 1,559 in music. The 
19 State public schools report 233 instructors in school departments, 206 in indus- 
trial departments, and 610 assistants caring for the inmates. The number of 
pupils reported was 9,158. Of these 973 were in kindergartens and 1,559 in music, 
The value of grounds and buildings was $5,546,827, and the expenditures were

CHAPTER XLVII. 
STATISTICS OF PUBLIC KINDERGARTENS. 
There are now 213 cities in the United States of over 4,000 population in which 
public kindergartens are maintained in connection with the city systems of public 
schools. The table on the next page summarizes the statistics of the public kin- 
dergartens of these 213 cities for the scholastic year 1898-99. There was an 
increase of 24 in the number of cities supporting public kindergartens over the 
preceding year. The actual number of kindergartens reported was 1,542, an 
increase of 177. The number of teachers employed was 2,829, an increase of 297. 
The number of pupils in the kindergartens was 109,894, an increase of 14,027 over 
the year 1897-98. The information in Table 2 was furnished this office by the city 
superintendents of public instruction. The table shows the number of public 
kindergartens in each city, the number of teachers, and the number of pupils by sex. 
For the year 1897-98 this office attempted to collect statistics of public and pri- 
vate kindergartens, kindergarten associations, and kindergarten training schools. 
The result was printed in Chapter LIII of the Education Report for 1897-98, pages 
2537 to 2579. The office, by much correspondence, procured the names of 2,998 
private kindergartens known to have been in operation in 1897-98. After'repeated 
requests for information, 1,519 private kindergartens reported statistics to this 
office. Detailed information from the 1,479 other private kindergartens reported 
as still in existence could not be obtained. The 1,519 kindergartens reporting had 
8,232 teachers and 47,853 pupils. Allowing proportionate numbers of teachers and 
pupils, it may be estimated that the 1,479 kindergartens not giving statistics had 
3,173 teachers and 45,884 pupils. Taking this as a liberal estimate, the 2,998 pri- 
vate kindergartens had 6,405 teachers and 93,737 pupils in 1897-98. The statistics 
of the private kindergartens as thus estimated will be found summarized in the 
last three columns of Table 1 on the next page. 
Assuming that the private kindergartens in 1898-99 maintained the average 
enrollment of the preceding year, the number of children receiving instruction in 
kindergartens was not less than 203,631. If the private kindergartens have kept 
pace with the growth of public kindergartens, 10,000 to 15,000 may be added to the 
grand total. 
The following table gives the number of public and private kindergartens, the 
number of teachers, and the number of pupils, as reported to this office for certain 
years beginning with 1873:

CHAPTER XLVIII. 
CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE HISTORY OF NORMAL SCHOOLS, 
IN THE UNIFED STATES. 
By M. A. Newest, formerly Secretary of the Maryland State Board of Education. 
i 
THE STATS NORMAL SCHOOLS OF NEW ENGLAND. 
1. MASSACHUSETTS. 
It is said that the first normal school of which we have any authentic account was 
established in Rheims, France, in 1681 by the celebrated Abbé de La Salle. But the 
normal idea goes much farther back. ‘‘ Vixere fortes ante Agamemnona.’? Luther 
was filled with it. The medizeval universities had for their prime object the produc- 
tion of doctors—teachers. And what were the ‘schools of the prophets’’ but teach- 
ers’ seminaries of a special kind? 
It is very probable that the normal school established by the Abbé de La Salle bore 
more resemblance to the Hebrew “‘schools of the prophets’’ than to the State nor- 
mal schools of New England; but let him haye due credit for his work. The schools 
of the Christian Brothers, of which he was the founder, are the most progressive of 
any under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church. The exhibit which they 
made at the New Orleans Centennial Exposition was highly creditable, and excited 
both surprise and admiration. 
But though France may have been first in point of time, Germany ‘‘bettered the 
instruction.” In 1697 August Hermann Francke organized a teachers’ class in con- 
nection with his school at Halle. Among the students who flocked to his school to 
Tearn his improved methods of teaching was Johann Julius Hecker, who founded a 
teachers’. seminary in 1735 at Stettin, im Pomerania, and another at Berlin in 1748. 
The graduates of the school at Berlin were considered so far superior to untrained 
teachers that it is said that Frederick the Great gave orders that no others should be 
employed to teach in schools on the crown lands of his kingdom. The school estab- 
lished at Berlin was afterwards removed to Potsdam, and both it and the school at 
Stettin became State institutions, the first State normal schools ever established.! 
To James G. Carter, of Lancaster, belongs the credit of having first arrested the 
attention of the thinking men of Massachusetts to the necessity of immediate and 
thorough improvement in the system of free or public schools. He has been called 
the father of normal schools in America, but recognizing the subsequent claims of 
“Father Peirce,” we should rather call Mr. Carter the “‘grandfather.” . His “Letters 
to the Hon. William Prescott on the free schools of New England”’ in 1824, and his 
“Essays on popular education,’ on ‘‘Education as a science,” and an “Institution 
for the instruction of teachers in 1825,’’ were pioneer efforts in the great work, and   
1Fifty-third Annual Report of the Board of Education, Massachusetts. 
2263

unlike most pioneer work, were as valuable and useful for construction as for destruc- 
tion. In 1827 he opened an institution with special reference to the education of 
teachers on the plans which he had expounded, and memorialized the legislature for 
aid. The memorial sets forth, ‘‘That he is about to open a seminary in a central 
part of the State for the general instruction of children and youth of both sexes, and 
also for the particular instruction of those who may resort to him for that purpose in 
the science of education, or in the best means of developing the physical, moral, and 
intellectual powers of the young by judicious and wholesome exercise of those pow- 
ers, and at a subsequent period of conveying to their minds the greatest amount of 
useful knowledge.’’? The normal school was evidently in his head not in a proto- 
plastic state, to be evolved and differentiated subsequently, but full grown, like 
Minerva in the brain of Jupiter, fully armed and equipped. Unfortunately, Vulcan 
was not on hand with his ax to effect a speedy delivery. 
Mr. Carter asked the legislature, as the chosen guardian of the schools, to extend 
to private enterprise a moderate amount of public patronage, so as to diminish the 
necessary expenses to individuals, and to open its doors to all who would aspire to 
the responsible employment of teachers of youth. By this union of private and 
public means he believed that ‘‘a seminary for the. education of teachers might be 
at once commenced upon a scale more commensurate with its importance to the 
community, more adequate to the public demands for better instruction, more in 
keeping with the fundamental principles of the free schools, and more consonant 
with the whole spirit of our free institutions.” 
The committee to whom the memorial was referred made a favorable report. They 
say that Mr. Carter’s plan ‘‘is entirely practical in its character, simple in its details, 
and peculiarly calculated to develop the powers of the mind, and that the studies it 
requires are brought wholly and appropriately within the pale of downright utility.” 
The committee further say that while they ‘‘incline to the opinion that this institu- 
tion should be detached entirely from all other pursuits and be devoted wholly and 
distinctly to the simple object in view, they would not be considered as deciding 
definitely that it could not be safely connected with some of the literary establish- 
ments of the State.’”? It is worthy of note that the sentiment of Massachusetts, so 
far as that sentiment has found record, was not in favor of the experiment tried 
afterwards in New York of grafting a normal scion on an academic stock, nor of the 
Pennsylvania system of pooling the issues between the State and a private corpora- 
tion. The committee preferred an institution ‘‘detached entirely from all other 
pursuits’’ with the ‘‘simple object in view’’—the preparation of teachers. 
The committee are very frank in expressing their views as to the necessity of such 
preparation. They say ‘‘it needs neither argument nor an exhibition of facts to 
demonstrate to the legislature that the free schools of the Commonwealth are not 
such as they ought to be—that they fail, most essentially, of accomplishing the high 
objects for which they were established. Upon this subject public opinion is fully 
settled. Nor is it difficult to arrive at the true cause. Can it in the large majority 
of cases be traced to any other cause than the incompetency of teachers?” The logic 
is simple and irrefutable. Our schools are not what they ought to be. The cause 
of failure is the incompetence of the teachers. To have competent teachers we 
must instruct them in the business of their profession. Therefore, etc.,Q.E.D. But 
neither the logic nor the eloquence of the committee prevailed with the legislature. 
The recommendation of the committee was lost by a majority of 1.1 
The story of the origin of normal schools in the United States has been told so 
often and so well that it is introduced here merely for the sake of completeness, and 
must be disposed of in the briefest possible manner. It was not due to any notice- 
able uprising of popular opinion; it had not been heralded by any voice crying from

NORMAL SCHOOLS IN THE UNITED STATES. 2265 
the wilderness; it would have come, sooner or later, in any event; but the precise 
date of the adyent seems to us mortals almost like an accident. 
In August, 1834, the Rey. Charles Brooks, of Medford, Mass., on his way from 
London to the United States, made the acquaintance of Dr. St. Julius, of Hamburg, 
who had been sent by the King of Prussia to learn the condition of schools, hospitals, 
prisons, and other public institutions in the United States. The six weeks compan- 
ionship of these two men (record-breaking steamers had not then been invented) 
resulted finally in planting the seed which afterwards grew up as the normal school 
system of the United States. Mr. Brooks says: ‘‘I fell in love with the Prussian 
system, and it seemed to possess me like a missionary angel. I gave myself toit, and 
in the Gulf stream I resolved to do something about State normal schools. This was 
its birth in me, and I baptized it ‘my sea-born child.’ After this I looked upon each 
child as a being who could complain of me before God if I refused to provide for him 
a better education after what I had learned. The whole Prussian system,’’ he says, 
“is built on these eight words, ‘As the teacher is, so is the school,’ and, therefore, we 
must have seminaries for the preparation of teachers.”’ 
In 1835 Mr. Brooks called a convention of the citizens of Plymouth, to whom he 
opened the whole matter as clearly and as strongly as he could, showing that the 
great work must begin by founding a State normal school in Plymouth County. The 
audience was warmed up, and Ichabod Morton, dean of the first parish, rose and said: 
“Mr. President, I am glad to see this day. The work is well begun; the facts now 
presented to us so plainly prove conclusively the inestimable value of teachers’ semi- 
naries. Mr. Brooks says he wants the first one established in the old colony, and so 
do I, sir, and I will give one thousand dollars toward its establishment.’’? Thus the 
Prussian stranger began its journey from Plymouth Rock. 
Many conyentions were held, many speeches were made, many resolutions adopted, 
in 1838, but the points emphasized in nearly every conyention were: 
First. The deplorably low condition of the public schools. 
Second. The necessity for immediate and radical reform. 
Third. A declaration that the inauguration of normal schools after the Prussian 
model would reform and vitalize the whole system of elementary education in the 
State. 
At one of these conventions (Hanover, September 3, 1838) Daniel Webster and 
John Quincy Adams were present, and though both had attended under the condi- 
tion that they were not to be called on to speak, yet neither of them was able to 
refrain from giving expression to the feelings and sentiments which had been 
developed by contact with the enthusiastic leaders of the movement. 
Mr. Webster said he was anxious to concur with others in aid of the project. The 
ultimate aim was to elevate and improve the primary schools. If the town schools 
were no better than they were when he attended them, he was sure they were insuf- 
ficient to the wants of the present day. This plan of a normal school is designed.to 
elevate the common schools and thus to carry out the noble ideas of our Pilgrim 
fathers. But there isa larger view yet. Every man and every woman, every brother 
and every sister is a teacher. Parents are eminently teachers. Now, if normal 
schools are to teach teachers, they make parents and all who in any way influence 
childhood competent to their high office. In families there will be better teaching, 
and the effect will be felt throughout society. 
Mr. Adams said: 
The original settlers of New England were the first people on the face of the globe 
who undertook to say that all children should be educated. On this our democracy 
has been founded. Our town schools and town meetings have been our stronghold 
in this point, and our efforts now are to second the efforts of our pious ancestors. 
Some kingdoms of Europe have been justly praised for their patronage of elementary 
instruction, but they were only following our early example. Our old system has 
made us an enlightened people, and I feared that the normal school system was to  
-P-A-G-E-1026
    2266 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
subvert the old system, take the power from the towns and put it into the State, and 
overturn the old democratic principle of sustaining the schools by a tax on property; 
but Iam happy to find that such is not its aim or wish; but on the contrary it is 
accordant to all the old maxims, and would elevate the town schools to the new 
wants of a growing community. "We see monarchs expending vast sums to establish 
normal schools through their realms, and sparing no pains to convey knowledge and 
efficiency to all the children of their poorest subjects. Shall we be outdone by 
kings? Shall monarchs steal a march on republics in the patronage of that education 
on which a republic is based? On this great and glorious cause let us spend freely, 
yes, more freely than on any other. 
Mr. Brooks and his immediate and active coadjutors, Edmund Dwight, Ichabod 
Morton, George B. Emerson, Dr. Channing, James G. Carter, Horace Mann, and 
other less conspicuous but not less honored men, had joined in their minds the idea 
of a State board of education and a State normal school as essential elements of the 
proposed reform of the system of her publie schools. It was plain to them then, asit 
is plain to us now, that a State normal school without the support and direction of the 
State itself would be but as a ship set adrift on the ocean without sails and without 
a pilot. Each seemed to them to be the necessary complement to the other, and 
much of the objection raised afterwards against the State board of education was 
really directed against the State normal school. 
First Srare Boarp or Epvcation. 
The board of education was established by a yote of the legislature, and was organ- 
ized on the 29th of June, 1837, with Horace Mann as secretary. The promoters 
of the enterprise hoped to have Mr. Carter as the executive officer, but they were, 
fortunately as we now think, overruled. No better man than Horace Mann could 
have been selected. It was understood from the beginning that the first business of 
the board was to organize a State normal school. Without Mr. Brooks the child 
would not have been born at that time; without Horace Mann it might not have 
survived the perils of infancy. 
The new board of education recommended, as was expected, the enactment of a 
law for the establishment of State normal schools. It is doubtful whether their rec- 
ommendation would have been adopted had not a ‘‘deus ex machina’? descended 
for the occasion. Mr. Edmund Dwight proposed to the legislature that he would be 
responsible for $10,000 to aid in the establishment of teachers’ seminaries, provided 
the legislature would give the same amount for the same cause. On the 19th of 
April (a marked day in the history of the United States) the legislature passed reso- 
lutions accepting the gift, and authorizing the governor to draw a warrant on the 
treasurer for $10,000 for the purpose specified in the resolutions. Thus were the 
State normal schools of Massachusetts launched upon an ocean of uncertainty, but 
with a fair prospect of reaching the desired harbor.! 
The board decided to establish three normal schools—one for the northeastern, one 
for the southeastern, and one for the western part of the State, to be continued three 
years as an experiment; and as the money at their disposal was not sufficient to erect 
buildings, they proposed to establish the schools at suitable places as soon as the 
requisite assistance was given. Many towns in different parts of the State submitted 
proposals; and at a meeting of the board December 28, 1838, it was voted ‘‘to locate 
anormal school for the qualification of female teachers at Lexington, and one at 
Barre for both sexes.’’ 
This is the first official use of the word ‘‘normal;’’ and it is to be noticed that it 
needed an explanatory phrase, “for the qualification of female teachers.” The 
word in the sense in which it was used was not English, and was not understood 
except by educational experts. The English ‘Training school for teachers,” or the

German ‘‘Teachers’ seminaries”? would have been intelligible and suggestive; but 
the French ‘‘Normal’’ conveyed no precise information to any but well-educated 
people. There is not a principal of a normal school who was living twenty-five years 
ago whohas not been addressed, as the writer has been, as principal of the ‘ nor- 
man”’ school, or (Dii avertite omen!) principal of the ‘‘Mormon”’ school. But words 
are things. They are more. They are living things. Theytake root. They bear 
fruit. And this word ‘‘normal’’ has borne much bad fruit. There are scores of so- 
called ‘“‘normal” schools in the country which have nothing ‘‘normal’”’ about them 
except in their advertisements and catalogues. But the word became popular, and 
unscrupulous dealers in education used it as an unprotected trade-mark to make 
their wares more salable. 
. LexincTon-FRAMINGHAM SCHOOL. 
The Rey. Cyrus Peirce was engaged to teach the school at Lexington. Had he 
proved a failure, success would have been postponed fora quarter of acentury. But 
he had said, ‘‘I would rather die than fail,’’ and though he came very near dying, 
there was no symptom of failure. He succeeded even beyond the expectation of 
Horace Mann, a man of great expectations. ‘‘He not only knew how to teach 
with precision, but he evoked from his pupils such a force of conscience as insured 
thorough study and assimilation of whatever was taught.’’ There is no doubt that 
the rapidly inereasing popularity of normal teaching was largely due to the conscien- 
tiousness, the sagacity, and the professional skill of ‘‘ Father Peirce. ”’ 
The opening day came, July 3, 1839, and with it a heavy rain. Assembled in the 
reception room of the normal building were the august visitors of the school, with the 
newly elected principal, and before them sat three timid girls—only three—to be 
examined and enrolled as the first pupils of the first State normal school in America. 
The first quarter closed with 12 students. In the fall a model school was conducted 
with 33 pupils. ‘‘The normal students are,’’ says Mr. Peirce, ‘‘in the very unde- 
sirable condition of being familiar with the books without knowing anything they 
contain.”’ The studies for the first term were the common branches, algebra, natural 
philosophy, physiology, mental philosophy, bookkeeping, moral philosophy, and 
geometry. Inan address delivered about this time by his excelleney Edward Everett, 
chairman of the board of education, his excellency laid down very clearly the lines 
on which normal instruction is built and the objects it should seek to accomplish. 
(1) Instruction, especially in the common branches. 
(2) The art of teaching. 
(3) The science of school government, and theory applied to practice in the model 
school. 
Truly we have not advanced far since those days. Movements there have been, 
but motion is not always progress. 
Mr. Peirce worked for three years in Lexington, performing an almost incredible 
amount of labor. There was no appropriation for assistance of any kind, and he took 
it upon himself to supervise or actually perform the menial services of the school. 
He seldom allowed himself more than four hours sleep out of the twenty-four. He 
attended to the fires, he rang the school bell, he heard almost every recitation in the 
normal room, and visited the model room at recess. With the assistance of his wife 
he examined the written exercises, the compositions, the school journals, answered 
the demands of his large correspondence, and arranged all the details of every day’s 
school duties with a persistence and conscientiousness unsurpasséd, if ever equaled, 
elsewhere. ‘‘Had it not been for Cyrus Peirce,’ says Dr. Henry Barnard, ‘‘I con- 
sider the cause of normal schools would have failed or haye been postponed to an 
indefinite period.” *

2268 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99, 
COUNTER REVOLUTION. 
The course of aggressive reforms, like the course of true love, never runs smooth. 
The normal school had demonstrated its power; therefore the normal school must be 
crushed. In March, 1840, the committee of education was directed by an order of 
the house of representatives to ‘‘consider the expediency of abolishing the board of 
education and the normal schools, and to report by bill or otherwise.’’ The board 
of education and the normal schools were regarded as Siamese twins—the death of 
one would be the destruction of the other. The normal schools were not popular at 
first. Brooks and Carter and Mann believed in them, but there were many who 
regarded them as newfangled heresies. The committee on education belonged to the 
latter class. The teacher, like the poet, they said, as Gail Hamilton said forty years 
ago, ‘‘nascitur, non fit;’’ the faculty of acquiring necessarily implies the faculty of 
of imparting; all that is needed is knowledge. That will bring with it skill. The 
arguments of the committee are worth reproducing, inasmuch as they contain the 
germ of all that has been said in opposition to normal schools for the last half century. 
(1) Phey are imitated from France and Prussia, where ‘‘the smallest bridge can not be 
built or any village road repaired until acentral board has been consulted.”” ‘‘ The 
French and Prussian systems appear to be much more admirable as a means of politi- 
cal influence and of strengthening the hands of the government than as a means for 
the diffusion of knowledge.” 
(2) Academies and high schools are fully adequate to furnish a competent supply of 
teachers. ‘‘ Comparing the normal schools already established with the academies and 
high schools of the Commonwealth, they do not appear to present any peculiar or 
distinguishing advantages.”’ 
(3) There is no need of professional instruction. ‘It is insisted by the board of educa- 
tion that the art of teaching is a peculiar art, which is particularly and, exclusively 
taught at normal schools, but it appears to the committee that every person who has 
himself undergone a process of instruction must acquire by that very process the art 
of instructing others.’’ [Nomine mulato. Every person who has himself undergone 
the process of being shaved by a barber, must acquire by that very process the art 
of shaving others. ] 
(4) ‘It is obviously impossible, and it is perhaps not desirable, that the business 
of keeping these [district] schools should become a distinct and separate profession, 
which the establishment of normal schools seems to anticipate.’’ 
(5) ‘We have no adequate security that the teachers thus taught at the public 
expense will remain in the Commonwealth, and it seems hardly just that Massachu- 
setts should be called upon, to educate at her own cost teachers for the rest of the 
Union.”’ 
(6). These normal schools ‘‘do not appear to have any stronger claims on the 
public treasury than many of our academies and high schools.” 
(7) ‘The idea of the State controlling education, whether by establishing a central 
board or by organizing normal schools, seems a great departure from the uniform 
spirit of our institutions—a dangerous precedent and an interference with a matter 
more properly belonging to those hands to which our ancestors wisely intrusted it. 
It is greatly to be feared that any attempt to form all our schools and all our teachers 
upon one model would destroy all competition, all emulation, and even the spirit of 
improvement itself.”” 
The committee, in accordance with their report, submitted a bill abolishing the 
board of education and the State normal schools. But Horace Mann and his 
enthusiastic supporters were too strong for the conservative committee, and the bill 
was lost by a vote of 245 to 182.4 The ‘‘counter revolution’? failed. 
Just forty-seven years later a gentleman of Alabama published a pamphlet 
  
1Commonwealth of Massachusetts. House Document No. 49, session of 1840.
-P-A-G-E-1029
  NORMAL SCHOOLS IN THE UNITED STATES. 2269 
entitled ‘‘The normal school question investigated,’’ which had the same object as 
the report of the committee and met with the same fate. It begins, ‘‘Ought the 
normal schools of Alabama to be abolished? I think they ought, and in the follow- 
ing pages shall give some of the reasons why I think so.” But the reasons are so 
much shrouded in rhetoric that it is hard to find them. A few specimens will suffice: 
There is nothing taught in the normals which is not taught in the other schools of 
the State. Why, then, should they be supported by the State? * * * Those 
seeking an education very naturally accept the free tuition tendered them, and, 
besides, they very readily see that, with much lower attainments and much less 
merit, they can secure the more desirable situations for having attended the normal, 
so that the very natural tendency is to lower rather than exalt the standard. 
Besides, the State may have the satisfaction of seeing her true and tried teachers 
crushed financially and driven from the field. * * * The appropriations to the 
normal schools have all the offensiveness of the worst kind of class legislation, and 
as such are fine fuel for communistic fires. * * * I am aware that many are 
looking to our normal schools to furnish us teachers. Such hopes are delusive. 
They willnever be realized. * * * Normal students, when you get them through 
school, will not accept work in our common country schools. * * * Is ita part 
of the legitimate duties of our lawmakers to establish and endow institutions to 
manufacture teachers? Would it not be better to have teachers educate themselves 
like [sic] men do for the other professions? * * * I can scarcely realize how men 
can be sincere when they talk about the abolition of these [normal] schools affect- 
ing disastrousfy the educational cause of the State. No fears need be entertained. 
The tide is rising. These normals are only a little driftwood on the surface, showing 
that the swell is coming. Their abolition would possibly affect disastrously a few 
towns and a few teachers, but it will in no wise retard the steady growth of a healthy 
educational interest in the State. This interest was here before the normals came, 
and when they are gone it will continue to grow." 
The rhetoric of the pamphleteer had no more effect on the legislature of Alabama 
in 1887 than had the logic of the committee on education on the Massachusetts legis- 
lature in 1840. 
The normal schools of Massachusetts in their youth were not popular institutions. 
Carter and Brooks and Horace Mann believed in them from the first. Daniel Webster 
and John Quincy Adams and men of their stamp, capable of broad views of the pres- 
ent and prescient of the future, gave in their adhesion, but conservatism, localism, 
and vested interests were against them. A formidable assault through the news- 
papers, principally religious newspapers, led by a minister of the Gospel, caused some 
fear and trembling for a moment, but served in the end to show the strength of the 
fortress. Thirty-one Boston schoolmasters raised the old cry, “‘Great is Diana of the 
Ephesians!’ A Boston school committee objected to the employment of a school 
superintendent who should spend part of his time in the training of teachers because 
“such training would lead to repeated experiments with new methods.” But in 
spite of opposition, and partly because of opposition, the normal schools went on 
“conquering and to conquer.” 
Three years of unremitting and excessive labor in Lexington proved too much for 
Mr. Peirce’s health—a man of less power of endurance would have broken down 
sooner—and in 1842 he resigned, and after two years’ rest returned to his old charge. 
The school had now outgrown its accommodations, and a suitable building was offered 
at West Newton. The price was $1,500, which was given to Horace Mann by Josiah 
Quincy, jr. Before this Mr. Mann had sold his own library to fit up the normal 
boarding house at Lexington. In 1849 Mr. Peirce’s health again failed, and he was 
compelled again to resign. 
The school soon outgrew its accommodations at West Newton, as it had done those 
at Lexington, and in 1852 an appropriation of $6,000 was made by the legislature to 
defray the expense of providing a more commodious building and a better site for the 
school with the necessary appurtenances and apparatus. The choice of site fell

upon Framingham, a spot ‘‘beautiful for situation,’’ but so far from the nearest rail- 
way station that the school fell off in numbers for some years. 
On Christmas day, 1887, the boarding house of the school, Crocker Hall, which had 
been built in the year previous, was partially destroyed by fire, and the legislature at 
their first session thereafter appropriated $105,000 for the repair of the hall and the 
erection of a new academic building. If this appropriation is compared with the 
amount yoted to remove the school from West Newton to Framingham, an idea may 
be formed of the rise in value of normal schools in thirty-five years.

Two months and one day after the opening of the normal school at Lexington the 
school at Barre (established by vote of the board of education at the same time) was 
opened for the reception of students under the principalship of Samuel P. Newman, 
a graduate of Bowdoin College. The opening was signalized by an address from the 
governor of Massachusetts, Edward Everett, one of the most perspicuous and most 
polished of his speeches, perspicuous and polished as they all are. He sets forth 
with great plainness and with sufficient amplification the aims and purposes of 
normal schools: 
(1) A careful review of the branches of knowledge required to be taught in our 
common schools, it being of course the first requisite of a teacher that he should first 
know well that which he is to aid others in learning. Such an acquaintance with 
these branches of knowledge is much less common than may generally be supposed. 
The remark may sound paradoxical, but I believe it will bear examination when I 
say that a teacher thoroughly versed in those branches only which are taught in our 
common schools is as difficult to find as a first- rate lawyer, divine, or physician, 
statesman, man of business, or farmer. * * 
(2) The art of teaching. To know the oie to be taught, and to know it thor- 
oughly, are of themselves, though essential, not all that is required. There is a 
peculiar art of teaching. The details of this branch are inexhaustible, but it is 
hoped that the most important principles may be brought within such a compass as 
to afford material benefit to those who pass even the shortest time at these institu- 
tions. 
(3) The third branch of instruction to be imparted in such an institution concerns 
the important subject of the government of the school, which might perhaps more 
justly have been named the first. The-best method of governing a school—that is, 
of exercising such a moral influence in it as is most favorable to the improvement of 
the pupils—will form a very important part of the course of instruction designed to 
qualify teachers for their calling. * * * How much is implied in the words, “‘to 
govern aschool!’’? For several hours in the day the teacher is expected to exercise 
the authority of a parent over fifty or sixty, perhaps over ninety or a hundred 
children. Without the aid of that instinct of natural affection which fortifies 
parental authority he is expected, with a parent’s power, to control alike the docile 
and the obstinate, the sullen and the gay. And he is to do this not by violence 
and storm, but by wisely threading the maze of that living labyrinth, the affections 
of the youthful heart. * * * The instruction of the normal school will therefore 
dwell on the government of youth as of paramount importance, as that part of the 
teacher’s duty which demands the rarest union of qualities, which most tries the 
temper, and, when faithfully and judiciously performed, is most important in its 
results. Give me the child whose heart has embraced without violence the gentle

Jove of obedience, in whom the ape of youth has not encroached on defer- 
ence for authority, and I would rather have him for my son, though at the age of 
twelve he should have his alphabet to learn, than be compelled to struggle with the 
caprice of a self-willed, obstinate youth whose bosom has become a viper’s nest of the 
unamiable passions, although in early attainments he may be the wonder of the day. 
(4) In the last place it is to be observed that in aid of all the instruction and exer- 
cises within the limits of the normal school, properly so called, there is to be estab- 
lished a common or district school as a school of practice, in which, under the direc- 
tion of the principal of the normal school, the young teacher may haye the benefit of 
actual exercise in the business of instruction. 
The temptation to quote from the magnificent peroration to this magnificent 
.address is too strong to be resisted. Like other classic gems it has found its way 
into our schoolbooks, and though much worn it will never become trite: 
Permit me, fellow-citizens and friends, in bringing this address to a close, to con- 
gratulate you on the establishment, in the bosom of this community, of an institution 
destined, we trust, to be an instrument of much good. We place it under the protec- 
tion of an intelligent public. Its organization is simple; its action will be wholly free 
from parade or display; its fruits, we trust, will be seen in raising the standard of 
common-school od ntetiore This object, we confess, we regard as one of paramount 
importance—second to no other not immediately connected with the spiritual con- 
cerns of man. If there be any persons to whom the words “‘common schools” and 
“common-school education” convey an idea of disparagement and insignificance, 
such persons are ignorant, not merely of the true character of our political system, 
but of the nature of man. I certainly intend nothing derogatory to our higher semi- 
naries of education in town or country. * * * But whether we consider the 
numbers who enjoy their benefit, the relative importance to the State of an entire 
well-educated population and of the services of those who receive the advantages of 
an education at the higher seminaries, taken in connection with the fact that a liberal 
education may be had elsewhere, but that a common-school education must be had 
at home or not at all, no rational man, as it seems to me, can fail to perceive the 
superior importance of the common schools They give the keys of knowledge to the 
mass of the people. * * * Our common schools are important in the same way 
as the common air, the common sunshine, the common rain—invaluable for their 
commonness. They are the corner stone of that municipal organization which is the 
characteristic feature of our social system; they are the fountain of that widespread 
intelligence which, like a moral life, pervades the country; they are the nursery of 
that inquiring spirit to which we are indebted for the preservation of the blessings 
of an inquiring Protestant spiritual faith. Established as they were by special legis- 
lation in the infancy of the colony, while they are kept up and supported with a 
liberality corresponding with the growth of the country no serious evil can befall us. 
Whatsoever other calamities, external or internal, may overtake us, while the schools 
are supported they will furnish a perennial principle of restoration. With her 3,000 
district schools, supported at the public expense, nothing but the irreversible decree 
of Omnipotence can bring the beaming forehead of Massachusetts to the dust. 
Vicissitudes may blight the foliage, but there will be vigor in the trunk and life 
at the root. Talent will constantly spring up on her barren hillsides and in her 
secluded vales and find an avenue through her schools to the broad theater of life, 
where great affairs are conducted by able men. Other States may exceed her in 
fertility of soil, but the skillful labor of her free citizens will clothe her plains with 
plenty. Other States may greatly outnumber her, but her ingenuity will people her 
shady glens and babbling waterfalls with half-reasoning engines which will accom- 
plish the work of toiling myriads. Other States will far surpass her in geographical 
domain, but the government of cultivated mind is as boundless as the universe. 
Wheresoever on the surface of the globe and in the long line of coming ages there is a 
reasonable being, there is a legitimate subject of mental influence. From the humblest 
village school there may go forth a teacher, who, like Newton, shall bind his temples 
with the stars of Orion’s belt—with Herschel, light up his cell with the beams of before 
undiscovered planets—with Franklin, grasp the lightning. Columbus, fortified with a 
few sound geographical principles, was, on the deck of his crazy caravel, more truly the 
monarch of Castile and Arragon than Ferdinand and Isabella, enthroned beneath the 
golden vaults of the conquered Alhambra. And Robinson, with the simple training of 
arural pastor in England, when he knelt on the shore of Delft-Haven and sent his 
little flock upon their gospel errantry beyond the world of waters, exercised an 
influence over the destinies of the civilized world which will last till the end of time."

2272 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
The school was kept at Barre for only three years. The whole number of students 
was 165; young women, 90; young men, 75. On the death of its principal it was 
suspended for two years, and was then removed to Westfield and placed under the 
care of the Rey. Dr. Emerson Davis as temporary principal. It occupied for one 
term the old academy building while rooms were being prepared for its accommoda- 
tion in the town hall, where it remained for two years, until a building of its own 
was completed and dedicated to its service September 3, 1846.! At this dedication 
the Rey. Dr. Heman Humphrey made the principal address. He said he would 
touch upon four topics: 
1) Upon the urgent demand for better-qualified teachers in our common schools. 
2) Upon the reasons why those who are to be teachers should be educated with 
special reference to the profession. 
(3) Upon what is embraced in a good professional teacher’s education. 
(4) Upon the adaptation of the normal system to give such education.” 
At the centennial celebration it was stated that the whole number of students reg- 
istered since the opening at Barre was 3,619, and the number of graduates since 1855 
(before which there was no formal graduation) 1,222. 
There are two courses of study in the modern school, a two years’ and a four years’ 
course. It will be interesting to compare these courses of study with the modest 
demands of Edward Everett and Dr. Humphrey fifty years before, and with the first 
printed course of studies under Principal Rowe in 1847.

The writer had the pleasure of visiting the Westfield school in 1865, when under 
the principalship of John W. Dickinson, now secretary of the board of education of 
Massachusetts. The impression made at that visit will never be obliterated. 
Though fresh from the study of other normal schools of high reputation—New Jer-

sey, Albany, Oswego, and others—he thought, and still thinks, that the West- 
field school was sui generis. One spirit seemed to pervade every room, every 
every student, every teacher—the spirit of John W. Dickinson. the genius loci. 
An immense and complicated machine animated by one spirit, every part working 
harmoniously with every other part for the accomplishment of one purpos In 
every department of study you found strictness of definition, precision of statement, 
upidity of reasoning, variety of illustration, abundance of practical application. 
Every question, every answer, every recitation, every exercise breathed pedagogy 
oi the severest type. One might, had he been inclined to find fault, have asked for 
a little more liberty, a little more self-assertiveness on the part of the students, a lit- 
tle more impulsiveness, a little freer play of individual thought, but the keenest critic 
must have acknowledged that the school was an organization ‘‘nobly planned’’ and 
skillfully directed by an expert whose convictions were like the laws of the Medes 
and Persians and who had the full courage of his convictions. 
In 1872 the legislature appropriated $72,000 for a boarding hall ample enough for 
the accommodation of all the students, and lately an appropriation of $150,000 was 
made to erect a new school building on new grounds.

The board of education contemplated the addition of a model school, or school of 
practice, to each of the normal schools under their jurisdiction. It was expected 
that the town school would furnish this necessary supplement, and such a school 
was maintained in connection with the normal school at Westfield from 1844 till 
1855. But ‘‘the relations of this school to the town and to the normal school were 
neyer entirely satisfactory, and they were dissolved in 1855, leaving the normal school 
to obtain its experience by practice on its own members. After this change the 
Westfield school turned its exclusive attention to the study of the philosophy of 
teaching, to gaining a technical knowledge of the branches of learning taught in the 
schools, to preparing such courses of study as are the right occasions for the acquisi- 
tion of useful knowledge and right mental development, and to training the pupils 
to teach by requiring them to recite all review lessons in thé form of teaching exer- 
cises. This method of work produced good practical results, and yet it did not fur- 
nish an opportunity for an experience in teaching and controlling a school of real 
children. To supply the want as far as possible, a school of observation was organ- 
ized in 1866, and so related to the norma} school that its principal could, by permis- 
sion from the town school committee, nominate the teachers, suggest a course of 
studies and exercises, and the method of teaching that should be practiced. The 
normal pupils were granted the privilege of observing the operations of this school 
and of teaching some of its classes.’’ *

It has already been stated that the State board of education decided, in April, 1838, 
0 open three normal schools, each to be continued three years as an experiment.

County were the first to apply to the board to have one of these three schools loca- 
ted within their borders. The board resolved formally to grant the request ‘‘as soon 
as suitable buildings, fixtures, and furniture, and the means of carrying on the 
school, exclusive of the compensation of teachers, should be placed at the disposal 
of the board.’’? At a county convention which met at Hanover in September, 1838, 
a resolution was passed to raise $10,000 for this purpose. It was found easier to pass 
the resolution than to raise the money. In fact, it never. was raised, although six 
towns were desirous of the honor of having the normal school within their limits. 
Finally the board was asked to name the terms on which they would locate the 
school at Bridgewater. 
The board voted ‘‘that the school be established at Bridgewater for the term of 
three years, on condition that the people of the town put the townhouse in such a 
state of repair as may be necessary for the accommodation of the school, and that 
they place at the disposal of the visitors of the school the sum of $500, to be expended 
in procuring a library and apparatus; and that they give reasonable assurance that 
the scholars shall be accommodated with board within a suitable distance at an 
expense not exceeding $2 a week.” 
The conditions were accepted, and the school was opened in the old town hall in 
September, 1840, with a class of 21 young women and 7 young men, under the 
charge of Capt. Nicholas Tillinghast. The hall was a frame building, 40 by 50 feet. 
For the accommodation of the school the main room was divided lengthwise by a 
board partition, so constructed that the lower half could be raised so as to throw 
the two rooms into one for general exercises. The seating corresponded to the 
building—a pine board attached to the desk behind. 
At the end of the three years for which the town hall was engaged, it became 
necessary to obtain a permanent and more capacious building. A memorial was 
presented to the legislature of 1845, signed by Charles Sumner and other prominent 
citizens of Massachusetts, asking for an appropriation of $5,000 for normal school 
buildings, on condition that a like sum should be contributed by private individuals 
for the same purpose. _The people of Plymouth promised to give the required con- 
tribution, and were very anxious to have the school removed to that town, but the 
board of education decided the question in favor of Bridgewater. Plans and specifi- 
cations were prepared and proposals called for, but no contract could be made 
because the board had not sufficient funds at their disposal. After considerable 
delay, Horace Mann came forward and gave his personal obligation to make up the 
deficiency, which turned out to be about $700, which he paid; but the money was 
afterwards returned to him from the State treasury. The house was only a plain 
wooden structure, 64 by 42 feet, and two stories high; but it was considered one of the 
most attractive schoolhouses in the State. At the dedication in August, 1846, Mr. 
Mann made one of his characteristic speeches. Referring to the opposition which 
the normal schools had met with, he said: 
       
I honor the great body of common school teachers in Massachusetts for the mag- 
nanimity they have displayed on this subject. I know that many of them have said, 
almost in so many words, and what is nobler, they have acted as they have said: 
“We are conscious of our deficiencies; we are grateful for any means that will supply 
them; nay, we are ready to retire from our places when better teachers can be 
found to fill them. We derive, it is true, our daily bread from school keeping, but 
it is better that our bodies should be pinched with hunger than that the souls of 
children should starve for want of mental nourishment, and we should be unworthy 
of the husks which the swine do eat if we could prefer our own emolument or com- 
fort to the intellectual or mental culture of the rising generation. We give you our 
hand and our heart for the glorious work of improving the schools of Massachusetts, 
while we scorn the baseness of the men who would appeal to our love of gain, or of 
ease, to seduce us from the path of duty.’”? This statement does no more than justice 
to the noble conduct of the great body of teachers in Massachusetts. To be sure 
there always have been some who have opposed the normal schools, and who will 
probably continue to oppose them as long as they live, lest they, themselves, should

be superseded by a class of competent teachers. These are they who would arrest 
education where it is, because they can not keep up with it or overtake it in its 
onward progress. But the wheels of education are rolling on, and they who will not 
go with them must go under them. 
A boarding hall for the students was built in 1869 in accordance with a resolution 
of the legislature which authorized the commissioners of the Massachusetts school 
fund to lend the board of education $15,000 for that purpose, and requiring the board 
to collect from the occupants of the boarding hall ‘‘a sum sufficient to cover the 
interest at 6 per cent per annum on the cost of said buildings and furniture, and a 
reasonable insurance of the same.’’ The next legislature increased the loan to 
$25,000. The interest was punctually paid, but in 1871 the legislature released the 
board from the obligation to pay interest and insurance, and so the loan became a 
gift. 
The hall was hardly built when it needed to be enlarged, and the school building 
also required enlargement. Both enlargements were carried through, and in 1889 a 
new building was imperatively required. It was erected at the cost of $150,000, and 
is one of the handsomest and best equipped of all the normal school buildings in the 
country. In addition to the usual assembly room, study rooms, recitation rooms, and 
libraries, it has 7 laboratories—2 physical laboratories, 2 chemical, 1 mineralogical 
and geological, 1 biological, and 1 industrial. The last is furnished with carpenters’ 
benches and sets of tools, a circular saw and jig-saw attachment, and is especially use- 
ful to students who wish to make sets of apparatus for their own schools without 
great expense. In the early days it was not easy for graduates of this school to find 
places as teachers; now the demand for graduates exceeds the supply. 
The school is organized, like the other State normal schools of Massachusetts, 
under the direction of the board of education, with three courses of study—a two 
years’ course, an intermediate course, and a four years’ course. The two years’ course 
includes arithmetic, bookkeeping, elementary geometry, algebra, elementary physics, 
chemistry, mineralogy, botany, zoology, geology, physiology, geography, astronomy, 
reading, orthography, etymology, grammar, rhetoric, literature, composition, pen- 
manship, drawing, vocal music, gymnastics, military drill, history and civil polity 
of Massachusetts and of the United States, and school laws of Massachusetts, psy- 
chology, science and art of education, school organization, school government, and 
history of education. It goes without saying that on some of these slices of bread 
the butter must be spread exceedingly thin. 
Thefour years’ course has, in addition to the above, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, 
surveying, physics, chemistry, botany, zoology, general history, English literature, 
drawing, Latin and French; Greek and German at the option of the principal and 
visitors. 
The intermediate course adds to the studies of the two years’ course such advanced 
studies as the regular order of exercises may permit. 
The catalogue of 1890 gives the names of 130 students in the two years’ course, 64 
in the four years’ course, and 5 in the intermediate. 
The early plans of the board of education looked to the maintenance of a model 
school, or school of practice, as an essential element of each of the State normal schools. 
The proper adjustment of the theoretical to the practical part of the work has been one 
of the greatest difficulties met with in most of the normal schools of the country, city 
training schools, perhaps, excepted. The Bridgewater school has had the benefit of 
much and varied experience on this point. For the first six years the model school 
was kept in a small schoolhouse, erected for the purpose by the center school district 
of the town, and was taught sometimes by a salaried principal and sometimes by the 
students of the normal school under the supervision of the principal of that school. 
Weare told that ‘‘practice teaching in the model school was not very attractive to 
the normal pupils. Those who had taught before coming to the normal school felt 
   
-P-A-G-E-1038
2278 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
that they were not specially benefited by this practice; and those who had never 
taught before did not become sufficiently interested to appreciate work’’ [how could 
they in the two weeks allotted to them?] ‘“‘and some parents preferred that their 
children should not be experimented with.”? The school was closed in 1850; but the 
new building (1891) has model school rooms for 120 scholars."

In 1852 the board of education, at the same meeting at which the proposals from 
Framingham were accepted, resolved to recommend to the legislature the establish- 
ment of anormal school in Essex County. The legislature approved the reeommenda- 
tion and made an appropriation to carry it into effect. Proposals were received from 
Salem, North Andover, Groveland, and Chelsea, and after a careful examination of 
the claims of the several localities the board decided on Salem, and experience has 
proved the wisdom of the selection. A suitable site was furnished by the city; a 
brick building was erected two stories high and 67 feet square, and was dedicated 
with appropriate exercises in September, 1854, Governor Washburn presiding. The 
school opened with 65 pupils (the largest opening number up to this date), under 
the superintendence of Mr. Richard Edwards, a graduate of the Bridgewater Normal 
School, afterwards principal of the normal school at St. Louis, and later State superin- 
tendent of public instruction in Illinois. He was succeeded in 1857 by Prof. Alpheus 
Crosby, who resigned in 1865, and was followed by Daniel B. Hagar, the present 
principal. ? 
As a necessary consequence of the labors of three men so distinguished as educators, 
the school overflowed its banks, and the legislature was called on for an appropria- 
tion of $25,000 to enlarge the building, which was promptly and cheerfully granted. 
The building as enlarged contains a reception room, 7 recitation rooms, and 3 
dressing rooms; an assembly room seated for 210 pupils, rooms for the principal and 
the assistant teachers, 3 laboratories and lecture rooms, a cabinet, a drawing-room, a 
library, and a room for text-books. The tower contains a valuable telescope, which 
was paid for by the voluntary contributions of several graduating classes. The 
school is intended for the preparation and training of young women exclusively. 
The course of instruction is the same as in other normal schools of the State. 
According to the Report of the Massachusetts State Board of Education for 1889, 88 
per cent of the graduates of this school have taught in the State: ‘50 in normal schools, 
2 as principals; 144 in high schools, 11 as principals; 46 in academies and seminaries; 
9 in colleges, 2 as professors; 7 in universities; 10 in deaf-mute schools; 8 in the 
Clarke Institution at Northampton; 5 in kindergarten schools; 4 in training schools; 
2 in State industrial schools; 1 in the school for the blind.”

The normal school at Worcester is thirty-five years younger than the pioneer 
school at Lexington. The experience of these years was in great part utilized by the 
new school. There was no need of experimenting. There was no fear of lacking

support. There was no dread of public opinion.1_ The way had been prepared. The 
paths had been made straight and.the rough places smooth. But the school was not 
content to follow in the wake of its predecessors. From the first it manifested an 
individuality of its own; and this has been strengthened by the double good fortune 
of permanence of location and permanence of its working staff. It has had but one 
principal in its seventeen years of life, and the changes in the subordinate members 
of the faculty have not been so numerous as to mar the continuity of the work. 
From the first no instructors were employed but persons having distinguished 
professional qualifications, including mature age, wide attainments, and successful 
experience. 
The whole number of students admitted up to January, 1890 (the date of the last 
available report), was 855, of whom 400 completed the course and graduated with 
credit. Ninety-five per cent of these graduates engaged in teaching almost as soon 
as they were free to do so. 
The Worcester school is a school of methods, par excellence; not of pedagogic 
methods merely, but business methods as well. The following selection of blanks 
will illustrate this in part. (The numbering is the editor’s.) 
When a student has signed the declaration to teach in the public schools of Massa- 
chusetts, as is required in all the normal schools’of the State, the following blank is

1Some years before this a student of a new normal school, not in Massachusetts, said to her instruc- 
tor in methods, ‘Professor, are we to teach this way when we go home?” “Certainly, that is 
expected,” replied the professor. ‘‘ Well, if I do,” was the answer, “I shall be hissed out of the dis- 
trict.” But she did; and though she was not exactly “hissed out,” she was made so uncomfortable 
that she sought and found another and better school.

As supplementary to the systematic study of psychology, the pupils of this school 
have been engaged for several years in the study of children, objectively, upon a 
plan which may be outlined as follows: 
The principal requests the students to observe the conduct of children under all 
circumstances—at home, at school, in the street, at work, at play, in conversation 
with one another and with adults—and record what they see and hear as soon as 
circumstances will permit. When the nature of the work is explained to the school 
great emphasis is placed upon the necessity of having the records genuine beyond all 
possibility of question; of having them consist of a simple, concise statement of what 
the child does or says without comment by the writer; of making both the obserya- 
tion and the record without the knowledge of the child; and of noting the usual, 
rather than the unusual, conduct of the individuals observed. 
For convenience in classification blanks of five colors are provided for the records; 
white paper is used for such observations as students make themselves, red for well- 
attested ones reported by others, yellow for reminiscences of their own childhood, 
green for mention of whatever they read on the subject, and chocolate for observations 
that extend continuously over a specified period of time. Each blank has the fol- 
lowing heading:

If the record is from hearsay the names of both recorder and observer must be

Pupils write their records at their convenience (immediately after making the

often found elsewhere except in city training schools—have led to the establishment 
of a system of apprenticeships ‘“‘under the joint supervision of the city superintend- 
ent of schools and the faculty of the normal school.’ Each student after a year 
and a half spent in the normal school is allowed—not compelled—to go to one of the 
public schools of the city to observe, to teach, and, occasionally, to take part in the 
government. The apprenticeship lasting for six months, every student has an oppor- 
tunity to serve in at least three grades of schools. Each apprentice keeps a diary of 
the occupation and experience of every day’s service, and this record is inspected 
by the faculty of the normal school. On the completion of the apprenticeship the 
teacher of the city school in which the service was rendered fills up the following 
blank:

It is thought that the experience of our earlier graduates must enable them to 
form valuable opinions as to the comparative usefulness in practical teaching of the 
various points in study and training to which they gave special attention here. Such 
opinions frankly expressed would furnish important hints for the future management 
of the school. 
The following questions are therefore sent to those who have taught two years or

  2286 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99, 
Norma Arr Scwoou or Massacnuserts. 
Drawing has for many centuries been recognized as one of the branches of a finished 
education in two opposite directions: Technological, as a necessary auxiliary in archi- 
tecture, engineering, and kindred pursuits; and fashionable, from works of tapestry 
down to the copying of prints. The fashionable»school catalogues of the beginning 
of the century generally wound up with ‘‘drawing and the use of the globes”’ at so 
much ex Even to-day there are thousands of teachers who make a living by 
ng their pupils in making pictures to be framed for parlor adornment on which 
not one stroke of the pupil’s own hand can be recognized. 
The introduction of drawing as a necessary elementary study is but of recent date. 
In 1749 Benjamin Franklin published his ‘‘Proposed hints for an academy,” in 
which we find the following: 
       
  Studies to be selected and adopted.—As to their studies, it would be well if they could 
be taught everything that is useful and everything that is ornamental. But art is long 
and their timeé 1s short. It is therefore proposed that they learn those things that 
are likely to be most useful and most ornamental. 
Writing, drawing, and ariihmetic.—All should be taught to write a fair hand and 
swift, as that is useful to all. And with it may be learned something of drawing by 
imitation of prints, and some of the first principles of perspective. 
  This is perhaps the first recognition in the United States of drawing as entitled to 
the same rank as writing and arithmetic, among the ‘‘useful’’ branches of learning. 
In 182i William Bentley Fowle took charge of a Lancasterian or monitorial school 
in Boston, in which he made drawing a general exercise. Mr. Fowle was ahead of 
his time, like many other reformers, and after two years’ service, his employers dis- 
covered that they had no further need of him; but the people had, and a company 
of private citizens built a schoolhouse and invited him to take charge of it. The 
school, called the Female Monitorial School, was a notable success, 
In 1827 Mr. Fowle published an elementary work on drawing, translated in part 
from the French of M. Francoeur, with additions and alterations to adapt it to the 
use of schools in the United States. In his preface he says: 
Notwithstanding the great utility of this branch of education, it is a lamentable 
fact that it is seldom or never taught in the public schools, although a very large pro- 
portion of our children have no other education than these schools afford. Even 
in the private schools where drawing is taught, it is too generally the case that no 
regard is paid to the geometrical principles on which the art depends. Not one in fifty 
of those who have gone through a course of instruction can do more than copy such 
drawings asare set before them. They never originate any design, and rarely attempt 
to draw from nature. 
         
If Master Fowle had lived forty years longer, he might have made thé same remarks 
with equal truth and equa! pertinency. 
Among the pioneers of the movement which culminated in the general intro- 
duction of drawing asa common-school study must be reckoned the Hon. Henry 
Barnard, editor of the American Journal of Education, and subsequently the first 
U. S. Commissioner of Education. 
In 1838 Dr. Barnard delivered several lectures on drawing as the foundation of all 
industrial education, and urged that drawing should be taught inthe common school 
pari passu with reading and writing. It was generally believed at that time that 
the ability to draw was a gift bestowed only on a few, and that, consequently, it 
would be a waste of time and energy to make it a common schoolstudy—in fact, throw- 
ing pearls before swine. Dr. Barnard’s yiews on this subject are briefly presented in 
the following extract from Professor Stone’s Report on the Practice of Music and 
Drawing in the Common Schools of Prussia, made to the legislature of Ohio in 1838, 
and printed. 
The universal success also and beneficial results with which the arts of drawing 
and designing, vocal and instrumental music, have been introduced into schools was
-P-A-G-E-1047

another fact peculiarly interesting to me. I asked all the teachers with whom I con- 
versed whether they did not sometimes find children actually incapable of learning 
to draw and to sing. I have had but one reply, and that was that they found the 
same diversity of natural talent in regard to these as in regard to reading, writing, 
and other branches of education; but that they had never seen a child who was ca- 
pable of learning to read and write who could not be taught to sing well and draw 
neatly; and that, too, without taking any time which would at all interfere with, 
indeed which would not actually promote, his progress in other studies. 
  DRAWING IN PRUSSIAN SCHOOLS, 1840, 
How slow is the process of observing, appreciating and imitating the best methods 
of instruction may be seen by comparing the system used in the Realschule of Berlin 
in 1840, with the systems, or want of system, in vogue in the United States thirty 
years later. Again we are indebted to that invaluable thesaurus, the American 
Journal of Education (August, 1840): 
The drawing department of this school [the Royal Realschule of Berlin] is super- 
intended by a teacher who has introduced a new method of instruction particularly 
adapted to the purpose for which drawing is to be applied in common life and in the 
rts; a method which is found to enable a much larger proportion of the pupils to 
make adequate progress than the ordinary one of copying from drawings. In this 
method the pupil begins by drawing from simple geometrical forms, those selected 
being obtained from models in wood or plaster, of a square pillar (74 inches high 
and 13 inches in its square section), a niche, and a low cylinder (the form of a mill- 
stone). The square pillar separates in joints, affording a cube and parallelopipeds 
of different heights. The hemisphere which caps the niche may be removed, leaving 
the concave surface of its cylindrical part. The exercises of the pupils run thus: 
First, to place upon a board, or upon his paper or slate, a point vertically above 
another point, or so that the lines joining the two shall be parallel to the right or left 
hand edge of the board, paper, or slate; second, to join them; third, to place a point 
horizontally from the second, and at a distance equal to that between the first and 
second points; fourth, to place one vertically over the third, and at a distance equal 
to that below the first, ents join the third and fourth. The third and fourth being 
then joined, a square is formed. After practice in this, the simple elevation of the 
cube is drawn; next, a perspective, by the use of a small frame and silk threads, 
such as is common in teaching the elements of this subject, and by means of which 
the pupil acquires a knowledge of the practice. * * * This method of teaching 
has been introduced quite generally in Prussia, and with the best results as to the 
formation of acc@racy of eye and of hand. 
REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON DRAWING, 
Compare with this the report of the “special committee ‘on drawing,’ Boston, 
1870. A few short extracts will suffice: ' When this committee was appointed, the programme of studies in the schools of 
the first twelve wards of this city included drawing. The Boston programme was 
weil, so far as it went; but it was not followed. In many of our schools no time was 
given for even the very mechanical exercise the rules prescribed. There was a 
general feeling among the teachers that drawing was simply an accomplishment for 
those whose leisure might be amused by its exercise, and that a large majority of the 
children in their charge would be better off without it; and with this impression 
joined to the knowledge that there were no examinations or requirements in this 
1 While this statement is correct in the main, the writer feels it due to truth to say that it is too 
broad. He has met with many exceptional ‘cases where a good reader could not be taught to sing. 
Color blindness is not uncommon; tone blindness is probably just as common. There is this differ- 
ence, that the inability to recognize a color (in school education) hurts only the observer; the ina- 
bility to produce the proper sound is an annoyance to all who are compelled to listen. With regard 
to drawing, the sentiments of the present writer are expressed in the following anecdote: Ata 
meeting of the International Conference on Education, held in London, August, 1884, James Russell 
Lowell, in the course of some extempore remarks, said that he ‘once knew a teacher of drawing of 
whom he asked the question: How many can you teach to draw? ‘Anybody.’ It is to me you speak; 
how many can you teach in a hundred? ‘Well, fifty.’ But how many can youteach well? ‘Perhaps 
twenty.’ But how many to draw what you would call weil? ‘Well, perhaps, in two or three years, 
one.’”’
-P-A-G-E-1048
  2288 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
department for promotion to higher schools, it is not strange that the time, already 
insufficient, was found too short for drawing. In some schools the routine of taking 
out the books, allowing the children to play with pencil and paper for half an hour, 
and then putting away the result, often without examination, was virtuously per- 
formed. In a few schools instruction, and good instruction, was given by the master 
and his assistants. But thiswas very exceptional. * * * There was nowhere any 
system from the primary to the high schools.! 
But though no great progress had been made in the teaching of drawing in the 
thirty years referred to, the subject was kept before the people, and the way was 
prepared for action when opportunity should offer. 
REMBRANDT PEALE IN PHILADELPHIA, 
In 1840 Rembrandt Peale, the painter, being convinced that drawing could and 
should be taught in public schools of every grade, offered his services, at a merely 
nominal salary, to the Philadelphia High School as professor of graphics. His pur- 
pose was to verify his theory by actual experiment. The experiment was entirely 
successful. He then offered to introduce his system into the lower schools if the 
directors would allow him. This proposal stirred up much opposition. To teach 
children, children of the poor, to draw was an unheard of and dangerous innovation. 
Drawing was an accomplishment, not a necessity; a luxury to be enjoyed by those 
only who were willing and able to pay for it. In the common schools it would be 
a waste of time. So argued the ‘‘conservatives.’’ The ‘‘progressists’’ had a majority 
of votes, but the minority were so persistent and so virulent in their opposition that 
the scheme was dropped, and Peale resigned his position in the high school shortly 
afterwards. ‘‘Could Mr. Peale’s ideas have been realized,’’ wrote Prof. John 8. Hart 
to Hon. John Eaton, United States Commissioner of Education, ‘‘in a great mechan- 
ical and manufacturing city like Philadelphia, I have no doubt it would have added 
millions annually to the productiveness of its artisans. Thirty years ago I expressed 
the belief, and I am willing still to abide by the record, that such a system as Mr. 
Peale’s, fully and fairly carried out, would have been worth to the city pecuniarily 
more than the entire cost of her system of public schools.”’ 
  WILLIAM MINIFIE IN BALTIMORE. . 
In 1848 and 1849 there was in the Boys’ High School of Baltimore a teacher of 
drawing, Mr. William Minifie, who taught the subject as a science and not as picture 
making. Based on geometry, his progressive studies proceeded systematically, and 
the progress made by his pupils was most striking. After teaching in the high 
school for one or two years this teacher was dismissed, because, forsooth, some mem- 
ber of the committee, who was utterly ignorant of any form of art, had some favorite, 
equally guiltless of any ability to teach industrial drawing, whom he wished employed; 
rational drawing was relegated to the limbo of forgotten things, picture making was 
encouraged, and the school children of Baltimore for the next twenty years were 
deprived of the very opportunity England had taken such pains to furnish, and which, 
twenty years later, Massachussetts made such commendable efforts to procure.? 
Post hoc et propter hoc. In his elaborate report on the school drawing exhibits 
in the Centennial Exhibition at Philadelphia, Mr. Charles B. Stetson writes: 
The specimens of drawings done by the boys in Baltimore City College [formerly 
high school] which are here exhibited consist almost wholly of reproductions from 
flat copies in light and shade. There are landscapes, trees, rocks, dilapidated houses, 
fences, bridges, carts, etc. The boys who are compelled to do such work are truly 
to be pitied. There is nothing to indicate the course of instruction, if really there is 
anything of the sort.

  NORMAL SCHOOLS IN THE UNITED STATES. 2289 
The following history of the Normal Art School is taken from the fifty-third report 
of the Massachusetts board of education, with some abridgment and many omissions: 
A petition was presented to the legislature of 1869, asking that the board of edu- 
cation be requested to report a definite plan for prov’ iding instruction in drawing in 
all towns of the Commonwealth having more than 5, 000 inhabitants. * * * In 
response, the legislature passed.a resolve, which was approved June 12, 1869, instruct- 
ing the board of education to consider the expediency of making provision for giv- 
ing free instruction to men, women, and children in mechanical drawi ing in all towns 
having 5,000 inhabitants or more and to report a definite plan therefor to the next 
legislature. 
The board, through a committee of three of its members, recommended the pas- 
sage of a law ‘which shall require elementary and free-! hand drawi ing to be taught 
in all the public schools of every grade, and which shall further require all cities and 
towns of inhabitants to make provisions for giving annually free instruction in 
industrial or mechanical drawi ing to men, Women, and children in such manner as 
the board shall prescribe.’? * 
By an act of the legislature aa May 16, 1870, drawing was included among 
the branches of learning required to be taught i in the public schools. Provision was 
likewise made for giving free instruction in industrial or mechanical drawi ing to per- 
sons over 15 years of age, all to be under the direction of the school committee. 
The above act was to take effect upon its passage. To ingraft upon the educational 
system of the State this branch of instruction created a demand for special training 
in the art of drawing; but from what source were the instructors to come? Clearly 
an institution for training the teachers must be established, or no satisfactory results 
would follow. 
In the autumn of 1871 the board employed Mr. Walter Smith, recently from the 
Art School, Leeds, England, to be State director of art education. * * * Con- 
vinced of the necessity ‘of providing some means for the training of teachers in the 
new branch of study, Mr. Smith advised the establishment of a school for that pur- 
pose. The board, acting upon Mr. Smith’s recommendations, at once appealed to 
the legislature for ‘the means to establish a normal art school. The first appeal was 
not successful. The means were finally provided, and on November 11, 1873, the 
school was located in rooms in the third story of a priva ate dwelling then in posses- 
sion of the State, in Pemberton square, Boston. * * 
These were wholly inadequate to the demands, ae originally prepared for 36 
students, while the school at first numbered 107 and in a short time contained twice 
that number. The legislature of 1875 authorized the sergeant-at-arms to assign to the 
school other rooms in another dwelling in Pemberton square. From this location in 
the fall of 1875 it was removed to rooms, 10 in number, in School street block, oppo- 
site the city hall. Here it remained for a term of five years, when it was again 
removed to better-fitted and more ample rooms in the Deacon House on Washington 
street. Its last remove was in 1878, to a building constructed for its special use on 
the corner of Dartmouth and Exeter streets. ‘The Normal Art School building was 
constructed at an expense of about $85,000. It is favorably located. Though una- 
dorned, it is artistic in design and finish, It is abundantly provided with the neces- 
sary appliances for art teaching, and is in every respect a model of convenience for 
the purposes it was built to serve. 
The number of students kept pace with the constantly increasing means of accom- 
modation, and was always in advance of these until the art building was erected. 
The present number is 220. The number that have received certificates and | diplomas 
is 498; the number that have graduated from the full course is 71.   
RESULTS OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SCHOOL. 
The law of 1870, which required drawing to be taught in schools of all grades 
throughout the Commonwealth, went into operation in the absence of every direct 
means for its enforcement. There were but few teachers of drawing in the State; 
there was no published scheme for instruction in drawing which was adapted to the 
several grades of schools; there was no popular public sentiment among the people 
which demanded its introduction into the list of branches required to be taught. 
The Normal Art School has, during the seventeen years of its existence, prepared 
teachers of practical skill in the art of drawing, for the evening schools now kept in 
all the cities and large towns of the State. It prov ided a large number of art directors 
and teachers of drawi ing for public and private schools, for the normal and technical 
schools, and for the collegiate, institutions, and they are filling important positions in 
all parts of the country. *

Perhaps the most important result produced by the school is seen in its influence 
on the general culture of the pupils in all schools where drawing istaught. It trains 
them to observe with accuracy and intelligence. Its exercises cultivate the imagina- 
tion and the judgment; they increase the power of invention, and produce an evident 
effect in puritying the heart and refining the taste. 
When the Normal Art School began its work the highest idea of drawing in most 
schools which gave the subject any attention was picture making, with little else 
besides copying from books. At present the scheme for teaching this branch begins 
with molding the elementary forms in clay and extends through all grades of exer- 
cises to the highest forms of the art. The present scheme is the elaborated product 
of much careful study and varied experience by numerous patient observers and 
workers; and, while it incorporates much that is of foreign birth, it avoids the mis- 
takes of other countries and furnishes a system of instruction well adapted to our 
own. * 
The indirect result is what was anticipated by some of its early advocates and what 
was inevitable: it is creating a taste among the people for art in designs foreign to 
our hitherto unfamiliar eyes, and at the same time is training designers and artists 
for manufacturing establishments which but a few years since were wholly dependent 
upon aliens, or upon the product of their taste and skill brought from other markets. 
PROF. WALTER SMITH. 
The spread of elementary drawing throughout the public schools, not only of Mas- 
sachusetts, but of the United States, is largely due to the experience, skill, and 
untiring energy of the first principal of the Boston Normal Art School and State art 
director, Prof. Walter Smith. The principles he advocated and the methods he 
pursued, exhibited in his Boston work and diffused and popularized by his lectures 
at teachers’ institutes at home and addresses at educational conferences throughout 
the country, were as good seed sown on good ground and brought forth fruit, ‘‘some 
thirty, some sixty, and some an hundred fold.”’ Disciples followed in crowds and 
in their turn became apostles of the new art education. A man of such energy, of 
an aggressive spirit, of great self-confidence, of such firm belief in his own doctrines, 
his own plans, his own methods, could not fail to stir up opposition. The assailants 
in normal-school contests have two methods of attack. They may attack the system 
itself or they may attack the head of the system. When the attack is made on both 
sides at once, it needs no prophet to foretell the result; the man is sure to fall, as 
in Walter Smith’s case—a very small, almost insignificant, minority in the legisla- 
ture, aided by the governor (Benjamin F. Butler), making an attack on the system, 
while a powerful combination outside the legislature made war upon the man. The 
board of visitors formed a sort of aulic council around the art school, and their orders, 
though given with the best intentions, proved very embarrassing to the commander in 
chief. 
No doubt mistakes were made on both sides; but when two undertake to ride a 
horse one must ride behind, and the obstinate Englishman refused the back seat. 
Taking all the circumstances into account, an unconciliating chairman, an unconcili- 
atory principal, a number of very sensitive teachers, a publishing house acting on 
strictly business principles, it is rather to be wondered at that the fiat had not gone 
forth sooner, ‘‘Delenda est Carthago.”” And so Walter Smith returned to his native 
land, not without due recognition of his splendid talents on both sides of the Atlantic. 
In their first report after the retirement of Professor Smith the committee on 
drawing say: 
That we are able to carry on drawing so successfully as we do under existing cir- 
cumstances is due to the past, which gave us a sound system of instruction, trained 
many teachers in the practice of free-hand and model drawing, taught the principles 
of design, substituted true for false models as objects of study, and both perfected 
and equipped the free evening drawing schools, which deservedly rank among the 
most useful institutions of the city. 
Referring to the appointment of Mr. Walter Smith in 1883 as head master of the 
art department of the Technical College at Bradford, England, the Right Hon. A.J.

Mundella in a public address ‘‘ congratulated the Technical College on having Mr. 
Walter Smith as an art master.’’ ‘‘ ‘There were few art masters,’’ he said, ‘‘ who had 
‘the experience and who possess so completely the successful art of teaching as 
Mr. Walter Smith and who knew how to apply art to industry.’’! 
COURSE OF STUDIES. 
The school offers two courses of study—a four-years’ course, which gives training 
in the scientific and artistic branches and in their application to industries, and a two- 
years’ course, which trains for the work of teaching and supervising drawi ing in the 
public schools. There are four classes—A, B, C, and D. On the completion of the 
work of Classes A and C students receive a ‘diploma certifying that they are qualified 
to teach mechanical and architectural drawing. On the completion of the work of 
Classes A, B, and D they receive a diploma certifying to their qualifications to teach 
industrial art. 
Applicants for admission to Class A must pass examinations in the following subject 
1. Model drawing (outline). 
2. Model drawing (shaded). 
3. Historic ornament (outline from cast). 
Upon entering Class A choice is given to each pupil of beginning (a) a course of 
study that will fit him especially for teaching and supervising drawing i in the public 
schools, or (b) one that will prepare him to teach the broad subject of industrial art. 
Those desiring to enter on the former course (a) are required to pass an entrance 
examination (in addition to the subjects mentioned above) on the following subjects: 
(1) English grammar and composition; (2) history of the United States; (3) geogra- 
phy; (4) plane geometry; (5) elementary botany; (6) elementary ph: rysiology. .

The law establishing the first State normal school of Connecticut was passed in 
1849. It states explicitly that the object of this school ‘shall be not to educate 
teachers in the studies now required by law, but to receive such as are found compe- 
tent in these studies and train them in the best methods of teaching and conducting 
common schools.”” It provides that the number of pupils shall not exceed , that 
applicants shall sign a written declaration that their object in seeking admission to 
the school is to qualify themselves for the employment of common-school teachers, 
and that it is their intention to engage in that employment in the State; and that to 
all pupils legally admitted ‘the tuition and all the privileges of the school shail be 
gratuitous.”’ For the support of this school there was appropriated ‘the bonus 
derived from the ‘State bank,’ and the interest which may accrue thereon, from 
which the sum of twenty-five hundred dollars annually, for the term of four years, 
shall be paid to said trustees with said interest, no part of which sum shall be expended. 
in any building or fixture for said school.’’ At the same session the principal of the 
normal school was made ex officio superintendent of common schools. Slight 
changes were introduced into the original law in 1866, 1872, 1883, and in 1889. The 
most important changes were (1) the maintenance of two normal schools, one of 
them east of the Connecticut River; (2) the appropriation of $40,000 a year for their 
support; (3) the regulation of the number of students to be admitted is left to the 
State board of education; (4) authority is given to the State board of education to 
establish and maintain model schools under permanent teachers, approved by the 
board, in which pupils of the normal schools shall have an opportunity to practice 
modes of instruction and discipline.

The school was opened at New Britain in 1850 with encouraging prospects. Dur- 
ling the first year the number of pupils enrolled was 154; it rose, in 1855, to 359, and

then gradually decreased till, in 1864-65, it fell to 188. For the next four years the 
school was suspended (1865 to 1869), from causes which the editor has not been able 
to ascertain definitely, and at which he prefers not to guess, though he visited the 
school in its dying moments. But in 1869 it was reopened with 132 students, and 
the numbers continued to increase till 1874, when it was again closed for a year. 
In 1875 it was again resumed and the progress, judging from numbers, from that to 
the date of the last catalogue was steady and nearly uniform. This catalogue con- 
tains the names of 401 students. 
The building now occupied by this school was erected in 1882, and by successive 
alterations and additions has become almost a model. Besides the usual assembly 
room, schoolrooms, recitation rooms, lecture rooms, library, ete., it has two labora- 
tories, a cabinet, a manual training room, a cooking room, a lunch room, a room for 
drawing and modeling, a gymnasium, and two kindergarten rooms. 
The grouping of studies under several teachers is in some instances ‘‘ very peculiar.” 
For example, Miss A has drawing and literature; Miss B, arithmetic and geography; 
Miss ©, drawing and language; Miss D, singing and arithmetic; Miss E, kindergarten 
and sloid; Miss F, mathematics and English. The purpose is probably to prevent a 
teacher from running in one rut by giving her two ruts torunin. The gentlemen 
teachers, it should be noticed, are provided with but a single wheel, with one excep- 
tion, and he has a bicycle, ‘‘principles of teaching” and ‘‘writing.”” It must be 
acknowledged that certain unquestionable advantages may be obtained from this 
system of ‘‘union of opposites,’ especially when, as appears to be the case in the 
present instance, it is the result of design and not of accident or necessity. 
A characteristic feature of the Connecticut normal school is seen in the

The State board of education has under its supervision and full control three 
model schools—one at New Britain, with 404 pupils and 11 permanent teachers; one 
at Bristol, with 252 pupils, and one at South Manchester, with 635 pupils. 
The professional training course at New Britain will be understood from the fol- 
lowing outline: 
The first year gives a review of common-school subjects, with the special object of 
making the students familiar with the best methods of teaching children. 
The second year is devoted to observations, methods of teaching, trial lessons, 
assisting in model schools, psychology and general principles, and independent 
teaching under supervision. 
Observation.—At the beginning of the second year those students who have reached 
the required standard of scholarship in all subjects, and who are thought to be 
sufficiently mature, begin to work in the model schools. They visit the classes 
daily and describe the lessons they observe. 
Methods.—The teachers of the model schools sum up for the training class the 
essentials of each subject to be taught to children and teach children when members 
of the class are present. 
Trial lessons are required as fast as individuals show a good understanding of the 
work they observe. Students do not usually give lessons in the presence of all their 
classmates. Criticism of the teaching is not a public exercise, and each student 
receives personal suggestions and advice. 
Assisting.—After observing in the model schools, students are assigned to the model- 
school teachers as assistants. They are taught to place work on the blackboard, 
keep the register, make a programme, and hear classes in all subjects taught in the 
room. 
Psychology and general principles. —From this time on commonly accepted principles 
are discussed and some instruction is given in physiological psychology. 
Independent teaching.—Aiter the completion of the preliminary training described, 
every student must teach and govern successfully for three months one of the depart- 
ments in charge of the State board of education, located outside of New Britain, 
ue unden the supervision of skilled teachers and closely connected with the parent 
school. 
The members of the senior classes in the normal school observe frequently in the

kindergarten. The kindergartner gives to this class a careful statement of the prin- 
ciples and theory involved and instructs them in the occupations rela to primary 
work. The first five months are spent in observation and in study of the following 
special subjects: Biology, botany, physics, chemistry, physiology, free-hand drawing, 
modeling, coloring, inventional geometry, manual work, gymnastics, singing, litera- 
ture, and penmanship. 
A special diploma is awarded to graduates of the kindergarten training class.1 
A normal school which is organized with special reference to the requirements of 
any particular locality can not safely be used as a model for another where the 
environments are different; yet one who should wish to organize or to reorganize a 
normal school in any part of this country would do well to study carefully the plans 
and methods of the school at New Britain. They are fully up to the times, pro- 
vided always that the actual working corresponds exactly to the printed statement. 
WILLIMANTIC. 
This school was established by an act of the legislature passed in 1889. The sum 
of $75,000 was appropriated for the construction of a building, but without waiting 
for its completion the school was opened in September, 1889, in rented rooms. It 
is the counterpart, in miniature at present, of the school at New Britain. It is 
under the same superintendence and control and aims at developing the same 
principles by the same methods. 
RHODE ISLAND. 
What Horace Mann had been in the educational history of Massachusetts, Henry 
Barnard was in that of Rhode Island. He was the first State school commissioner, 
and spent some of the best years of his life in efforts to establish a system of State 
normal schools in Rhode Island. He visited every portion of the State, delivered 
lectures, organized teachers’ institutes, and began what he called an ‘‘Itinerating 
normal school agency.’’ During his term of office more than 1,100 public meetings 
were held to discuss subjects connected with the public schools, and at all these 
meetings one of the most prominent topics was the necessity of a thoroughly organized 
State normal school. 
After one year’s incessant and well-directed labor he was sanguine enough to 
believe that the time had come for carrying his projects respecting the State normal 
school into execution. His plan was to have two normal schools—one in Providence 
and the other scmewhere in the country. The school in Providence was to supply 
the missing link between the municipal schools and Brown University. The country 
school was to be a ‘‘training school”? with an industrial annex in which pupils 
might pay part of their expenses by manual labor. 
The scheme was too complicated—one might almost say too good—-to command 
popular favor. But the legislature seemed willing to try it, at least in part. In 1845 
a bill was passed authorizing the establishment of ‘‘one thoroughly organized nor- 
mal school in the State,’”? but no appropriation was made for carrying the law—if 
it can be called a law—into effect. The people were simply authorized to spend their 
own money and declined to spend it. 
Now, Brown University came to the rescue. The university created a new chair, 
a professorship of didactics, and Samuel 8. Greene, then superintendent of schools 
in Providence, was appointed to the position, which he was allowed to hold in con- 
nection with the superintendency. In the winter of 1851-52 the first normal classes 
were taught in the hall of the Providence high school. Next fall the school was 
opened, in rooms rented for the purpose, with 85 students and 3 assistant teachers. 
The following term was made noteworthy by a course of lectures on physical geog- 
raphy delivered by the celebrated Professor Guyot.

Donations and tuition fees, however, were totally inadequate to the support of such 
an institution. Even the $1,000 appropriated by the general assembly in 1854 proved 
to be but a drop in the bucket, and on the urgent recommendation of Mr. Elisha R. 
Potter, the school commissioner, who succeeded Dr. Barnard, the general assembly, 
May, 1854, passed an act establishing a ‘‘State normal school” and appropriating 
$3,000 for its support. The school was opened on the 29th of May with 27 students, 
under Dana P. Colburn principal; before the end of the session the registered stu- 
dents numbered 88. Within two years a library of 1,200 volumes was accumulated 
and a beginning made in the collection of apparatus. The ‘collection’ was slim 
enough—‘‘two movable blackboards, one 6-inch and two 12-inch globes, a valuable 
collection of outline maps and charts, and a set of anatomical plates.’’ The value lay 
in the fact that it was a ‘ beginning”’ and in the right direction. 
The genial spring was not followed by the usual bountiful harvest. Unseasonable 
winds began to blow, and kept on blowing. It was said by some that the towns 
should give more pecuniary aid, and that the State treasury should be relieved in 
part of the expense of maintaining the school. All parts of the State were not equally 
benefited, and yet all parts were equally taxed. The old and not yet exploded fal- 
lacy that education is a local more than a general benefit was urged for all and more 
than it was worth. It has fortified itself and been dislodged in many strongholds— 
the family, the district, the township, the State. When it is once expelled from the 
citadel the country will be safe. The citizens of Bristol were willing to receive the 
ark of the covenant, and thither it was carried; but the blessing did not follow it. 
About the beginning of the civil war the numbers in attendance fell off to 19—5 young 
men and 14 young women. 
At the close of the spring term in 1865 school adjourned for a vacation of five weeks. 
It was hoped that the general assembly would send it back to Providence, but the 
hope was not realized. The operations of the school were suspended until after the 
meeting of the legislature in May, and in July it was suspended indefinitely. But 
“blessings brighten as they take their flight.””. The institution was ‘“‘not dead, but 
sleeping,’’ awaiting the voice of the master. School committees were urgent in their 
demand for its reestablishment. One committee declares that ‘‘the need is becom- 
ing every year more urgent.’”’ Another, that “the best interests of public education 
can not be promoted without the establishment of a State normal school.’’ Another, 
that ‘the importance of establishing a State normal school as a means for the 
advancement of our common schools needs no argument.’”’ Another says, ‘‘ We hope 
that a normal school will be established in this State, and that no persons will be 
employed to teach in our public schools except graduates of that or similar institu- 
tions. Much of the time of the children is now thrown away at the commencement 
of each term by employing teachers, who, while their intellectual culture is all that 
could be desired, know but little, if anything, of the art of teaching.” 
Then the master appeared. 
Mr. Thomas W. Bicknell received the appointment [of State school commissioner] 
in May, 1869, and he at once set himself to work to bring about the desired result. 
He left no stone unturned during the years 1869 and 1870 to inspire and combine the 
public sentiment in favor of the enterprise. It is true that the ground had already 
been prepared and the seed had been sown by the labors of his predecessors, and he 
was able to reap the harvest which had in part been brought on to its growth and 
maturity by them. But at this particular moment it seemed to need precisely the 
qualities which Mr. Bicknell possessed and the efforts which he put forth to bring 
the former labors to their consummation. * * * By public educational lectures 
in every town in the State; by teachers’ institutes, and papers and discussions thereon; 
by the newspaper press, which opened its columns oe to the commissioner; by 
the Rhode Island institute of instruction; by the distribution of educational tracts, 
and by personal interviews with the members of the general assembly, the labors of 
the commissioner began to bear fruit.!

  NORMAL SCHOOLS IN THE UNITED STATES. 2295 
In 1871 a bill was introduced for the establishment of a State normal school, and 
was passed by a very large majority after a very brief discussion. The people were 
prepared for it. The board of education and the commissioner were made trustees, 
and they wisely selected Providence as the location of the school. The school was 
opened in September, 1871, ina rented building; but in 1877 the legislature made an 
appropriation of $40,000 for the purchase of a building for the permanent home of 
the school. The city of Providence being about to erect a new high school building, 
the old high school estate was purchased for $30,000 and fitted up comfortably for the 
use of the normal school with the remainder of the appropriation. The scheol took 
possession of its new home in December, 1878. From the ‘Catalogue and circular” of 
1880 we learn that the number of students for the scholastic year, including graduates 
who completed their course in January, was 200. The full course (seven half years) 
includes 100 lessons in composition and grammar, 300 in arithmetic, 100 in chemistry, 
150 in drawing, 100 in the English language, 100 in geography, 100 in physiology and 
hygiene, 50 in bookkeeping (single entry), 100 in general history, 100 in geometry, 
100 in reading, 200 in Latin, 100 in rhetoric, 100 in algebra, 100 in botany, 100 in 
physics, 100 in English literature, 50 in physical geography, 50 in geology, 50 in 
psychology, 50 in logic, 50 in ethics, 50 in zoology, 50 in pedagogy, 50 in primary 
methods, 50 in methods in geography, 50 in methods in grammar, 50 in mineralogy.

    NEW HAMPSHIRE. 
The history of the normal school campaign in New Hampshire is curious, inter- 
esting, and instructive—an early and promising attack, a victory, long in doubt; 
ignorance and prejudice behind the intrenchments; indifference, perhaps treachery 
within the lines; a deficient commissariat, skirmishes without results, compromises 
without advantage, indomitable pluck on one side, invincible obstinacy on the 
other—triumph at last. ‘The darkest hour of all the night” proved to be ‘the 
hour before the morning.” All the battles with ignorance, prejudice, misrepre- 
sentations, jealousies, parsimony, which had been fought and won in thirty other 
States, had to be fought again. And not in vain. 
“ For freedoms battle once begun, 
Bequeathed by bleeding sire to son, 
Though baffled oft is ever won.” 
Now peace, with wings outspread, hovers over the beautiful normal buildings at 
Plymouth; and for a peace offering thousands of dollars can be had almost without 
asking where hundreds were once sulkily refused. 
The story of the State Normal School of New Hampshire can best be given in the 
words of the present principal of the school, Dr. Charles C. Rounds, in an address 
which he delivered on the dedication of the new building. The present editor 
regrets that want of space compels him to omit many paragraphs from this interest- 
ing paper. After a brief sketch ef the development of normal schools in the State 
of Massachusetts, Dr. Rounds says: 
In 1823 there was established at Franklin, N. H., by the munificence of Mr. Joseph 
Noyes, a school called the Instructors’ School. Its principal for many years was 
Capt. Benjamin M. Tyler, a graduate of Captain Partridge’ ilitary School at 
Norwich, Vt. In regard to normal methods of teaching Captain Tyler was far in 
advance of his time, and in spring and fall terms for years he formed and taught a 
teachers’ class in the principles of the various branches of study and in methods of

teaching and school management. It has been claimed that more than sixty years 
ago there could be found at Franklin a superior normal school. 
Ata public dinner in Boston a few years since I heard Hon. J. W. Bradbury, of 
Maine, a colleague of Webster and Calhoun in the United States Senate, tell the 
story of the next normal school in New Hampshire. In 1829, having finished his 
course of legal study, he had three months to wait before admission to the bar. He 
had noted, as many were noting at that time, the miserable condition of the common 
schools and the mental poverty of the teachers therein. Instead of taking a vaca- 
tion he came across the line from his home, in Parsonsfield, Me., to Effingham, 
and organized for a three-months’ term a school for the preparation of teachers. 
The next attempt in our State to give teachers special preparation for their work 
was made here in Plymouth by Samuel Read Hall, who had been connected with 
the school in Concord, Vt., in 1823, and with Phillips Academy in 1829. In 1837, 
while teaching in Phillips Academy, he was asked to become preceptor of Holmes 
Academy in Plymouth, He accepted, on condition that it should be called a teachers’ 
seminary and should have a department specially for the training of teachers. These 
conditions were accepted, and for two years (1837-1839) the teachers’ seminary at 
Plymouth continued, and then was closed in consequence of the failure of an expected 
endowment. 
I hold in my hand the first catalogue of this teachers’ seminary. The course of 
study and the classification of the school show the honesty of the man and the char- 
acter of this, as a normal school, much truer to the name than many pretentious 
institutions which followed long after its time. Although it had a classical depart- 
ment, the teachers’ department evidently lay nearest the heart of Mr. Hall. 
Though this school antedated by two years the establishment of the normal school 
at Lexington, Mass., after its closing for many years no other similar attempt was 
made. Normal schools were established in other States in numbers increasing by 
a constantly accelerating ratio, but here the reliance seems to have been upon 
academies, and these doubtless did what they could. But under such auspices 
popular education could not advance, and after trying all other agencies the con- 
viction became stronger and stronger that again a special effort must be made. In 
1870 the act was passed for the establishment of a normal school. * * * 
There is not time now to give the history of the efforts which culminated in the 
passage of the normal-school law, nor of the contests which resulted in locating 
the school in the buildings of the Holmes Academy, at Plymouth. It was finally 
here established, and for several years sustained by the tuitions paid by pupils, and 
by the generosity of the town, of private individuals, and of the Boston, Concord 
and Montreal Railroad. Here I quote from the principal’s report to the trustees in 
1887: “Thirty-two years after the first normal school in Massachusetts had been 
established, with two years in its course of study, and years after Maine, Connecticut, 
and Rhode Island had established normal schools on the same basis, the State Normal 
School of New Hampshire was established, with the legal provision that said nor- 
mal school shall be established and maintained without expense to the State, except 
the necessary expenses of the trustees, which shall not exceed the sum of $300; that 
the school should be in session at least twenty weeks each year, and that pupils 
could graduate from oné of the courses at the end of one school year. Large num- 
bers actually went out from the school with diplomas at the end of a course of only 
twenty weeks. Yet the schoo, sustained by tuitions and voluntary contributions, 
opened with a good faculty and 70 students, and in its second year enrolled 184 
different pupils. To an urgent request of the trustees for $12,000 for building and 
$3,000 for a library, the State responded with a total appropriation of $5,000. In 
the first four years of the school the State gave nothing for current expenses. For the 
Jack of funds the faculty had to be cut down, and at the close of the third year 
the school suffered the loss of its first principal by death from overwork. During a 
part of the fourth year the faculty consisted of only two teachers, each teaching from 
seven to eight hours a day, and one of these broke down before the close of the year. 
In 1875 the State made its first appropriation for current expenses, and the school 
was declared a free school, but tuitions were still exacted from those who did not 
complete the course of the first or the second year until 1886. For four years, with- 
out endowment, the school had been sustained by tuitions and contributions. It is 
safe to say that a State normal school established under such auspices and sustained 
on such a basis was never before known. 
“The report of 1876 speaks of constant improvement in the school, of jealousies 
which had sprung up against the school as an intruder into the educational field, 
and of the great harm which had been done to the cause by the graduation of large 
numbers from the short course of twenty weeks—a course of study only one-quarter 
the length of the shortest courses of other New England normal schools. Of the 175 
graduating up to this time 158 had graduated from the twenty-weeks’ course. In

1878 the jealousies and opposition referred to in earlier reports resulted in reducing 
the annual appropriation for the school to $3,000. The numbers in the school had 
been greatly reduced; the outlook was most discouraging. Yet, instead of trying to 
increase the numbers by merely popularizing the school, it was made more severely 
rofessional than ever before. The one-year course was abolished. As might have 
een expected the numbers did not rapidly increase, but the character of the school 
as a school for professional training was established beyond all possibility of cavil. 
The policy continued by cutting down even the modest appropriations asked, or of 
refusing them altogether, and the complaint continues from year to year of insufii- 
cient accommodations and means of instruction. * * *” 
In 1885 an appropriation of $2,000 was asked for, but was refused. This was 
apparently a turning point in the history of the school. Hostilities which hindered 
its work ceased. Friends in increasing numbers came to its aid. The press gave it 
a more and more generous support. In 1887 it received from the legislature an 
appropriation of $12,000 for building, and the annual appropriation for support was 
raised from $5,000 to $7,000. * * * The legislature of 1889 gave an additional 
appropriation of $60,000, and you here to-day behold the fair results, a lasting 
monument to the many friends who worked so faithfully to secure this appropria- 
tion, as well as to the memory of the devoted teachers of the earlier days, who, amid 
discouragements, kept alive in New Hampshire the idea of the normal school and 
carried it through its phases of development. We haye this beautiful schoolhouse, 
which, for solidity of construction, for convenience, for its provisions for comfort and 
health, and adaptation to the work for which it is designed, may well challenge com- 
parison with any other. We have a boarding hall so planned and furnished as to 
offer to our pupils a comfortable, healthful, and eleganthome. * * * Thenormal 
school begins its twenty-first year under these favorable auspices. Like a traveler 
who, after long wandering through morass and fog, comes out into the sunshine on 
Ee ground, so we at last find firm support for our feet and see the sunshine on our 
path. 
The course of study does not differ greatly from that of other first-class normal 
schools limited to a two-years’ course, as will be seen by the following programme:

VERMONT. 
Sratz Normau Scnoor at CastLeron. 
The institution now known as the State Normal School at Castleton, Vt., celebrated 
its centennial in 1887, having changed its name several times during the century. It 
was established by act of the legislature in 1787 as a county grammar school in and for 
Rutland County, to be held ‘‘at the house commonly known by the name of the new 
schoolhouse, near Dr. William Woolcott’s in Castleton, provided that the county of 
Rutland shall not be at any cost or charge in completing or repairing the same.” 
Another act of the legislature provided ‘that it shall be known by the name and

style of the Corporation of Rutland Grammar School.” In 1805 it was enacted ‘“‘by 
the general assembly of the State of Vermont that the name and style of the Rutland 
County Grammar School be, and the same is hereby, altered to the name and style of 
the Vermont Classical High School.” This act-was repealed in 1830. In 1866 an 
act was passed authorizing the establishment of one normal school in each of the three 
Congressional districts of the State with two courses of study; graduates of the short 
course to receive certificates for five years, the others for fifteen. 
In 1867 the legislature granted an annual appropriation of $500 to each of these 
normal schools for the purpose of assisting indigent young men and women “‘inhab- 
itants of this State who may desire to more perfectly qualify themselves for the office 
of teaching by attending the normal schools within this State.’”” Persons so aided 
were required to teach at least two years subsequent to their graduation. 
This sum was increased in 1870 to $1,000, and in 1882 an additional $500 a year was 
appropriated to each of these three schools. In 1888 the legislature extended their 
charters until the year 1900. 
The first session of the normal school at Castleton was opened on the 2d of January, 
1868. 
In 1878 the legislature, fearing that the normal schools might attempt to fly too 
high, passed the following enactments to clip their wings: 
No. 113. Src. 2. No more than two courses of study shall be allowed in the normal 
schools of this State. No studies or subjects not included in the course of study estab- 
lished for them shall be taught in the normal schools of the State, nor in any school 
or department established and controlled by the trustees or by the teachers of any 
normal school in the State. 
Suc. 3. The two courses of study for the normal schools may include such branches 
of learning as have been set, or shall be set, in them, by the trustees of any normal 
school acting in concurrence with the State superintendent of education; but no foreign 
language, ancient or modern, shall be a subject of instruction in any normal school. 
  Yet the course of study in the Vermont normal schools is by no means narrow, 
judging from the list of text-books used. 
First course: Hill’s Geometry for Beginners, The Franklin Algebra, Greenleaf’s 
Complete Arithmetic, Prang’s Drawing Books, Maury’s Physical Geography, Walk- 
er’s Physiology, Wood’s Object Lessons in Botany, Eggleston’s History of the United 
States, Macy’s Our Government, True’s Our Republic, Conant’s Vermont, Whitney’s 
Essentials of English Grammar, Conant’s Drill Book in English, Seott’s Lady of the 
Lake, American Poems, American Prose, Principles of Education Practically Applied, 
Gill’s Systems of Education, Putnam’s Psychology, Payne’s Lectures on the Science 
and Art of Teaching, De Garmo’s Essentials of Method. 
Second course: Wentworth’s Algebra and Geometry, Sharpless and Phillips’s 
Natural Philosophy, Young’s Astronomy, Kellogg’s Rhetoric, Swinton’s Outlines of 
the World’s History, Arnold’s English Literature, Lockwood’s Lessons in English,

The Randolph Academy, or Orange County grammar school, was established in 
1806 in a building now occupied as a dwellinghouse. Its last principal was Edward 
Conant, ‘‘the father of the Vermont normal schools,’ by whose aid chiefly the 
academy was changed in 1866 to a training school for teachers—one of the three for 
which the legislature made an appropriation in 1867, as has been already mentioned. 
Normal schools naturally divide themselves into three groups: Those whose work 
is chiefly academic, and whose aim is to secure scholarship in the subjects taught; 
those of the character of city training schools, which strive to give their students a 
large amount of practical teaching after certain prescribed methods; and those which 
seek to give their graduates a scientific basis of practical pedagogy. The Randolph 
school claims to belong to the last class. 
From February, 1867, to June, 1890, the whole number of students admitted was 
1,877. Of these 819 graduated in the first course, and 122 in the second course.!

This school was started as an academy about the year 1828 with 16 scholars, in a 
room which had formerly been a shoe shop. In 1836 the school was incorporated 
by act of legislature as the Lamville County grammar school, and public lands 
were granted toward its support. In 1866 the school surrendered its original char- 
ter and was recognized as a State normal school. The old academy building was 
at this time rebuilt, greatly enlarged, and fitted up nearly as it stands now. The 
last principal of the academy, 8. H. Pearl, was the first principal of the normal 
school. In 1884 the village primary school was placed under the care of the princi- 
pal of the normal school as a model and training school, in which normal students 
should have the opportunity of doing practical work under the direction of experi- 
enced teachers.? 
The number of students June, 1890, was 136.

The teachers of Franklin County, Me., at their annual convention in 1857 passed a 
resolution ‘‘That the interests of our common schools and the teachers having them 
in charge not only require the fostering care of the State, but most imperatively demand 
the immediate establishment of that long-neglected source of improvement, a State 
normal school.’”” This was no uncertain sound, although it was but the echo of the

demand made ten years before by William G. Crosby, the secretary of the first board 
of education of Maine. For thirteen years longer the voice was heard as of one cry- 
ing in the wilderness, till at last, in 1860, the legislature was stirred up to activity. 
The first experiment was an endeavor to establish normal departments in 18 acade- 
mies of the State. Of course, the attempt was a failure. The law was repealed in 
1862, and an act for the establishment of normal schools was passed in 1863. A 
commission of three persons, appointed by the governor and council, was to locate two 
normal schools, one in the eastern and one in the western part of the State: ‘Provided, 
that the citizens of such places will furnish, without expense to the State, suitable 
buildings for the instruction of 200 pupils for the term of at least five years; and pro- 
vided, that such locations be not within the limits of any incorporated city.”’ To 
sustain these schools for five years, four half townships of the public lands were appro- 
priated, to be sold in whole or in part, as should be deemed best by the governor and 
council. The commission decided to locate one of these schools at Hampden, the 
other at Farmington, but two years afterwards Castine was selected in place of Hamp- 
den. The trustees of Farmington Academy offered a cash donation of $4,000, together 
with the academy building, which they proposed to enlarge so as to accommodate 200 
students. Theschool began in August, 1864, in a temporary hall, for the new building 
was not as yet completed. Thirty-one students were present at the opening, and 
during the year 130 students were entered, a number larger than in any subsequent 
year.1

From the circular of the State Normal School at Castine, Me., for 1890, we learn 
that the object and work of the normal school are plainly stated in the act establish- 
ing these schools in that State: 
They shall be thoroughly devoted to the training of teachers for their professional 
labors. The course of study shall include the common English branches, in thorough 
reviews, and such higher branches as are especially adapted to prepare teachers to 
conduct the mental, moral, and physical education of their pupils. The art of school 
management, including the best methods of instruction and government, shall have 
a prominent place in the daily exercises of said schools. While teaching the funda- 
mental truths of Christianity and the great principles of morality recognized by statute, 
they shall be free from all denominational teachings and open to persons of different 
religious connections on terms of perfect equality. 
This school has been in operation twenty-three years and has had over 2,000 dif- 
ferent pupils connected with it since its organization. 
A model primary school is in operation in one of the rooms of the normal building, 
which has been fitted with primary furniture for that purpose. This school is under 
the control of the principal of the normal school and is taught by a teacher specially 
-selected for that work. It has four grades, and is free to all children of these grades, 
as far as its capacity extends. The pupil-teachers are here furnished with a model 
which will help them to form an ideal of what a primary school ought to be. This 
enables them to have a standard of excellence in mind when they go out to teach, 
- which it will be safe for them to strive to attain. 
The following is the outline of work actually done in the model school in the dii- 
ferent grades:

NEW YORK. 
Ear.y History. 
In 1825 De Witt Clinton, governor of New York, in his annual message, speaking 
of the common school system, says: ‘‘In furtherance of this invaluable system I 
recommend to your consideration the education of competent teachers.’? This rec- 
ommendation is repeated in his message of 1826: ‘‘I therefore recommend a semi- 
nary for the education of teachers in the useful branches of knowledge.’’ The 
phrase ‘‘the education of teachers in the useful branches of knowledge”’ indicates 
that the governor had but a vague notion of the proper function of a “‘ teachers’ 
seminary;”’ and it is not to be wondered at that for many years after his death the 
people of New York struggled long and fruitlessly to make normal instruction an 
annex of the academy system. In his last message, 1828, the governor lamented 
that no law had been passed to elevate the talents and qualifications of teachers. 
In 1830 a committee of the citizens of Rochester petitioned the legislature to 
establish a State seminary for the education of teachers. 
In 1833 Governor Marcy said in his message to the legislature: ‘One of the most 
obwous improvements in relation to common schools would be a plan for supplying 
them with competent teachers.’’ There is no good reason to suppose that the 
“competency”’ thus desired extended further than a knowledge of the subjects 
taught in the common schools. 
In 1835 John A. Dix, chairman of a committee of the board of regents, recom- 
mended the establishment of teachers’ classes in the academies. 
In 1839 Governor W. H. Seward recommended that ‘‘ Normal-school instruction 
be ingrafted on our public school system.’”’ In the same year John ©. Spencer, sec- 
retary of state and ex officio State superintendent of schools, secured the passage of 
a law creating a board of visitors of schools. The chairman of the board was the 
Rev. Dr. (afterwards Bishop) Alonzo Potter, and with him was associated Francis 
Dwight, who afterwards became superintendent of schools for the city and county 
of Albany and secretary of the executive committee of the beard of regents. 
In 1842 a convention of county superintendents was held in Utica, at which the 
Rey. Dr. Alonzo Potter, Horace Mann, and George B. Emerson advocated the estab- 
lishment of a normal school; to which project the superintendents promised their 
support. In 1843 a similar convention was held, and again the county superintend- 
ents reported in favor of a normal school. In the same year Calvin H. Hulberd, as 
chairman of the assembly committee on colleges, academies, and common schools, 
made an eloquent and elaborate report, accompanied by a bill to establish a normal 
school for the period of five years. The bill was passed May 7, 1844. The law pro- 
vided that the sum of $10,000 shall be ‘‘annually paid to che superintendent of 
common schools, from the revenue of the literature fund, for the maintenance and 
support of * * * anormal school for the instruction and practice of teachers of 
common schools in the science of education and in the art of teaching, to be located 
in the county of Albany.’’? The ‘‘normal-school idea’’ had grown since the time of 
De Witt Clinton, whe'so ably advocated the establishment of a seminary ‘“‘for the 
educat.on of teachers in the useful branches of knowledge.’”’ The law also placed 
the school ‘‘under the supervision, management, and government of the superin- 
tendent of common schools and the regents of the university,’”’ but practically the 
school was governed by an executive committee of five persons appointed by the 
 
-P-A-G-E-1063
  NORMAL SCHOOLS IN THE UNITED STATES. 2303 
regents, of whom the law required that the State superintendent of common schools 
should be one. 
The school was first located in the depot building of the Hudson and Mohawk 
Railroad Company, the rent of which, $500 a year, was paid by the city of Albany; 
afterwards, 1849, in a house built by the State, at the cost of $25,000, on a lot pre- 
sented by the city in the rear of the old State Hall. The lot was not a very desirable 
one, and the building corresponded to the lot, though at the time it was regarded as 
“large and commodious.”’ 
The first principal was the now long lamented David P. Page, of whom nothing 
further need here be said, for he “being dead yet speaketh.’ ! One of the first 
“vegulations’”’ prescribed by the executive committee, doubtless at the instance of 
Mr. Page, deserves more than a passing notice: ‘‘The internal regulations of the 
school shall be left to take their form and character from the circumstances as they 
arise, and as the teachers may hereafter suggest.””     
  Norma DreparTMEnts IN ACADEMIES. 
For several years before and after the organization of the Albany school there had 
been maintained in several academies in the State of New York a department for the 
instruction of common-school teachers. These departments were of two classes: 
One was established by the regents of the university by virtue of chapter 140 of the 
Laws of 1834, for the support of which the regents appropriated annually to each 
academy $400—a sum supposed to be equal to the expense of maintaining the depart- 
ment; the other class consisted of those academies to which a share of the revenue 
of the literature fund, equal to $700 a year, was distributed for their ordinary sup- 
port, and which were required by the regents, pursuant to chapter 237 of the Laws 
of 1838, to establish and maintain departments for the instruction of common-school 
teachers. There were in 1840 eight academies in the first class and seven in the 
second. The number of students entered in these departments was, in 1835, 138; 
and in the following years successively, 218, 284, 374, 498; and in 1840, 668. The State 
superintendent, John C. Spencer, in his report for 1840 says he is “‘convinced that there 
has been a decided improvement in these departments. The standard of instruction 
in their vicinity has been raised. The desire for competent instructors has increased; 
their wages have advanced; the demand for them has augmented, and a general 
influence in favor of primary education of the most salutary character has been 
diffused.’’ He thought these departments should be sustained and encouraged, and 
the means of establishing a larger number in other academies should be provided. 
Where there were no academies he would have normal schools established—the 
neighborhoods furnishing the grounds and buildings and the State paying the 
teachers. 
These normal departments do not’ seem to have been either popular or efficient, 
notwithstanding the indorsement of Mr. Spencer. An academy in King’s County 
reports: ‘‘No students are at present (1840) connected with this [the normal] 
          
1“Dayid P. Page, though he labored but four years, filled those four years with such a consecrated _ 
purpose and professional skill that he left an impress upon the normal schools of this country that 
will live for centuries. This school, more than any other in the country, became a center of normal 
influence, which has pervaded every part of the United States; and I believe that if the true history 
of the establishment of normal schools in this country could be written, it would be seen that the 
influence of the school at Albany during its first four years has had more to do, directly and indi- 
rectly, with the organization and methods of instruction of other similar institutions than all other 
schools combined; and this I believe to be due to the rare genius and inspirational power of Dayid 
P. Page, the ablest normal-school principal that this country has produced—a man whose consecrated 
spirit, high moral endowments, magnetic presence and manners, rare genius for organization and 
management, intuitive knowledge of human motive and character, and strength of personal influ- 
ence, make him stand out peerless and alone among the many excellentand eminent men who have 
adorned similar positions im our country.” (Dr. Edward Brooks, superintendent of schools in Phila- 
delphia, in ‘‘ Proceedings of the National Educational Association, 1876,”) 
 
-P-A-G-E-1064
  2304 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
department, nor have any applied for admission since its organization.’? A seminary 
in Dutchess County reports that ‘‘ but few students, compared with the usual number 
in the school, have applied for admission to the teachers’ department.’? The Troy 
Female Seminary reports: ‘‘ No students have been instructed in this institution for 
the express purpose of teaching in common schools.”? The Albany Female Academy 
reports that ‘‘no separate department has been established exclusively for the edu- 
cation of common-school teachers.’’? The Ithaca Academy established a department 
for the education of teachers, but no students presented themselves for instruction in 
that department. 
On the other hand, the St. Lawrence Academy reports: “The establishment of 
this department has exerted a powerful and salutary influence on the character and 
supply of teachers of district schools.’’ And in the Genesee Wesleyan Seminary 
there were 184 students in the teachers’ department. 
Prof. Alonzo Potter, having visited officially a number of these academies, made 
an elaborate and instructive report on their condition, in which, after giving them 
due credit as aids in the education of teachers, he says: ‘“‘The principal evil con- 
nected with our present means of training teachers is that they contribute to supply 
instructors for select rather than common schools; and that, for want of special 
exercises, they perform even that work imperfectly.’”? Yet the academic idea is not 
yet extinct in New York, and in many so-called ‘‘ State normal schools,’’ both there 
and elsewhere, ‘‘the trail of the serpent”’ may be distinctly traced. 
From the annual school report of Superintendent Young we learn that in the year 
1842 there were 681 students under instruction in teachers’ departments in the acad- 
emies of New York. He says: ‘‘These departments have doubtless given increased 
character and efficiency to the business of instruction, but it must be admitted that 
most of them have practically failed in the accomplishment of the great object for which 
they were instituted—the special qualification of teachers for the common schools.” 
The great cause of this failure seemed to him to be that ‘‘ the bounty of the State is 
diffused over too great a surface, the small sum of $4,800 being divided equally 
among sixteen separate institutions.’’? Accordingly he advocates the establishment 
ofa State ngrmal school at Albany. ‘‘ Normal schools,” he says, ‘ will not be an 
innovation. They have, on a limited scale, been in operation for some years in the 
city of New York, and a similar institution was recently organized at Kingsboro in 
Fulton County.”

It is refreshing to compare the simple exercises of this pioneer school with the 
three and four story programmes of some normal schools of the present day. 
The school opens at 9 o’clock a, m. by reading the Scriptures and prayer. A gen- 
eral exercise follows on arithmetic, consisting of lectures and demonstrations from the 
blackboard by the principal and students in turn. Lectures are given on notation, 
numeration, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, the denominate numbers, 
reduction, and fractions; and a course of lectures has been given by the principal on 
ratio and proportion, with a practical application to the rule of three, direct, inverse, 
andcompound. In addition to this exercise in arithmetic, the whole school is divided 
into four classes, each class spending one-half hour per day in the solution of problems 
on the blackboard and in reading, the teacher telling them how to solve them and the 
reason of the operation. Particular attention is given to the principles of arithmetic 
and their practical application to the business of life. There are two classes in 
algebra and two in natural philosophy. Algebra has had a tendency to withdraw 
the attention of the students from the elementary branches, consequently less atten- 
tion will be given to this branch during the remainder of the term. The whole 
school is exercised in linear drawing, including most of the figures in geometry. 
Considerable attention has been given to penmanship, but not as much as its impor- 
tance deserves. An accomplished writing master has been engaged to teach this art, 
which will claim special attention during the term. The students are required to 
recite regular lessons in geography, taking their regular turn in hearing the recita- 
tions. Then follows a general exercise of the whole school called classifying, or, in

other words, repeating in concert the names of the different States and kingdoms of 
the world, with their capitals, the oceans, bays, seas, gulfs, lakes, rivers, ete. This: 
exercise is very interesting and profitable, as students will gain a knowledge of the 
names and situations of places much sooner in this way than any other with which E 
amacquainted. This exercise is followed by a lecture on the globe. In English gram- 
mar the females constitute one class, the males another, and about three-quarters of 
an hour every day has been occupied by each class in parsing, correcting false syntax, 
etc. Then follows a general exercise of the whole school, consisting of lectures by 
the students alternately, parsing difficult sentences, correcting grammatical errors: 
which occur in daily conversation, and with discussions on disputed points in gram- 
mar. One composition a week is required of every student, which is corrected by 
the principal in the presence of the writer. 
The whole school exercise daily upon the sounds of the letters and the principles of 
orthography. Great attention is given to elocution and reading. In addition to a 
daily exercise in concert by the whole school, including the elementary sounds of the 
English language, difficult specimens of articulation, and the best and most difficult: 
pieces in our language, five students declaim every day. The exercises are intended 
to cultivate and improve the voice, train the organs of speech, and improve the articu-- 
lation, pronunciation, and taste of the pupil. Attention is given to the grammatical 
and rhetorical pauses, emphasis, quantity and quality of voice, and everything neces— 
sary to enable the pupil to read with beauty, force, and variety.1 
The reader will bear in mind that this schedule is fifty years old. 
The establishment of the State Normal School at Albany was not followed imme- 
diately by the organization of similar schools in other sections of the State. A long 
time sometimes intervenes between the planting of a tree and the ripening of the 
fruit. The lack of enthusiasm in the cause of normal schools may be traced partly 
to the early death of the first principal, partly to a general suspicion that the Albany 
school was not doing strictly normal work, and partly to a preference for the loca¥ 
academies that were supposed to be quite capable of preparing teachers for their call- 
ing. It is certain that much of the opposition which normal schools afterwards: 
encountered in the State was due to the zeal of the friends of the academies. At. 
this very time (1891) an experiment is under way which may have the effect of giv- 
ing the training of teachers for district schools to the academies on the ground that. 
normal graduates are not willing to do ‘‘common school’? work for common schook 
compensation. If it succeeds, the New York system will be logically perfect: Train- 
ing classes, normal schools, and the normal college, corresponding to the elementary 
school, the high school, and the college in the scheme of public instruction. 
Nineteen years after the opening of the Albany school a normal school was estab- 
lished at Oswego, under FE. A. Sheldon, principal; and four years thereafter (1867): 
it was accepted by the State as a State normal school. The present writer visited 
this school in 1865, and made a report to the State superintendent of Maryland, from. 
which the following extracts are made: 
The training school at Oswego was organized mainly for the purpose of furnishing 
the city schools with teachers competent to carry out the objective or Pestallozzian 
system of teaching. The public schools of Oswego are divided into four grades: The 
primary, the junior, the senior, and the high school. Each school is divided into 
three classes, and the course of each class lasts for one year. Pupils are admitted at. 
five years of age, and if they pass regularly and without interruption through the 
whole course, they are graduated at the age of 17. New classes are formed only once 
ayear. Scholars presenting themselves after the new classes have been formed are 
admitted, provided their attainments correspond with the standard of any particular 
class. Ii they are found defective in certain studies they are sent to what is called 
the ‘‘Ungraded school,’’ an ingenious contrivance to prevent the uniformity of the 
classes from being broken by an influx of unprepared scholars. For the first four 
years of the child’s school life he is taught without books—reading-books of course 
excepted. The elements of language, number, place, color, and form; lessons in 
“objects,’”’ drawing, singing, as well as arithmetic and geography are taught by the 
living voice of the teacher, aided by maps, charts, pictures, real ‘‘objects’? when 
they can be introduced, and a@ unremitting use of the blackboard. * * * Of the

“objective system” of teaching pursued in these schools, I can not speak too highly. 
Thave examined and studied it very closely and I do not hesitate to say that it is 
not only a good system, but the only good system that I have seen for the rational 
education of young children. * * * The training school is intended to prepare 
teachers for conducting the exercises of the “Oswego system,” and is admirably 
fitted to accomplish this result. It.is divided into two sections whose time is divided 
equally between learning and teaching. One section ‘‘recites’’ in the morning and 
teaches in the afterngon, the other recites in the afternoon and teaches in the morn- 
ing. The students are not permitted to give any lesson to the section until they 
have rehearsed the same lesson themselves, and have written out a careful analysis 
of it.2 
For a more detailed and very excellent account of the Oswego school, the reader is 
referred to Circular No. 1, 1891, of the United States Bureau of Education, by Prof. 
J. P. Gordy. The tree planted at Albany in 1844 now began to yield an annual har- 
vest. 
The normal school at Brockport was established in 1867; Fredonia, in 1868; Cort- 
land and Potsdam, in 1869; Buffalo and Geneseo, in 1871; and, after a rest of fifteen 
years, Newpaltz, in 1886; Oneonta, in 1889, and Plattsburg, in 1890. Though each of 
these schools has some distinguishing peculiarities, it would be tedious and unprofit- 
able to discuss them separately, especially as at present (1891) they are all working 
under the following uniform curriculum, prescribed and enforced by the State 
superintendent of public instruction: 
COURSE OF STUDY. 
The following is the course of study now in force in the different normal schools: 
The elementary English course will be discontinued after the school year 1891-92, and 
the requirements for graduation will then be at least the work now laid out in the 
“Advanced English course,” which will then be designated as the ‘‘ English course.””

It must not be inferred that all the State normal schools of New York are purely 
and simply ‘“‘training schools for teachers.’ Nothing is easier than to write a 
uniform programme; nothing more difficult than to carry the ideal into practice. 
And it is well that it is so; a school without individuality is simply a wheel in a 
machine. Differences of situation, of local surroundings, of inherited traditions, of 
present aspirations, will differentiate the schools, whatever may be the outward bond 
of uniformity. It would not be surprising if, even at present, comparing the ‘‘train- 
ing school’’ theory with the academic practice, it should be hard to determine which 
is the main building and which the annex. 
Potspam. 
Music seems to be a specialty in the Potsdam Normal School. The Outline of 
Work in Music in the State Normal and Training School, Potsdam, N. Y., is an 8vo. 
pamphlet of 34 pages, the substance of which may be gathered from a circular of the 
school bearing date January 1, 1890, and containing the new uniform curriculum: 
OUTLINE OF COURSE IN VOCAL CULTURE AND SINGING. 
First year.—Voice placing, breathing studies, special attention to distinct articula- 
tion, purity of tone and clear intonation; English songs and ballads. 
Second year.—Study of vowels and consonants, development of voice in clear and

compend and guide for the use of young and untrained teachers, but without 
originality. The ‘‘ Object lessons” are no improvement on the pioneer efforts of 
Miss Elizabeth Mayo, nearly half a century ago, as will be seen from the following 
extracts from the ‘‘ Outline:””

Tue New Apvance. 
The honest intention and earnest desire of the State school authorities of New 
York to make their normal schools distinctly professional, and to exclude from them 
the two classes of students that have heretofore interfered with the declared pur- 
poses of these schools—those who desired boarding-school yeneering, and those who 
needed preparatory education which they could have obtained at home—are made 
manifest by the following extracts from the circular of the State superintendent 
(November 1, 1890) already quoted from. 
No students can be admitted who have not already acquired a substantial elemen- 
tary education. This can be gained in all the ordinary schools, and the professional 
training schools can not properly be taxed with work which the common schools can 
perform aswell. * * ‘There is room and welcome in the normal schools for 
the graduates of the ae and secondary schools, and even for those who have 
made substantial advancement in the elementary course without technical gradua- 
tion, provided they give promise of becoming successful teachers, and possess the 
desire to become such; but there is no room for students who have laid no real founda- 
tion for professional training, and who have no well-determined purpose about the matter, 
and no fair conception of the responsibilities and obligations of a teacher’s occupation. 
[Italics are the editor’s.] * * * Nostudent is desired at a normal school who 
does not read readily and intelligibly, spell correctly, and write legibly and neatly. 
Regardless of diplomas, certificates, and examinations, principals will refuse admit- 
ance to all students who do not possess these acquisitions in a highly creditable 
legree. 
If these conditions are complied with in good faith, New York may well boast of 
having the best arranged and most perfectly equipped system of normal schools in 
this country. 
The preparation actually required and exacted from candidates for admission to 
the New York normal schools will be best understood from the following sets of 
examination papers: 
ENTRANCE EXAMINATION QUESTIONS. 
[Prepared by a committee of normal principals and published by the State department of public instruetion.] 
Entrance examination, February, 1900. 
Write the subject of the examination, your name, and the date at the head of 
your papers. 
The work should be written out in full in the answers. 
Correct answers will receive ten credits each, and a proportionately less number 
will be allowed as the answer approximates correctness or shows knowledge of 
principles. 
In order to secure admission candidates must gain an average of seventy credits 
in the three branches and not fall below sixty credits in any one of them. 
Use care in spelling, writing, and general neatness of appearance.

  In this ‘‘new departure,” or to speak more accurately, in this return to first prin- 
ciples, the Albany school is expected to take the lead. The executive committee, to 
whom the reorganization of the school was committed, found that the instruction 
heretofore given had been chiefly academic; that teachers had been chosen for their 
scholarship rather than for pronounced professional ability; that the work done in 
the early years was largely the same as was done in the academies and high schools; 
that while increased attention was being given to pedagogy, yet the conditions of 
admission were so low that students of very meager attainments in scholarship were 
permitted to enter, and consequently a large part of the time of the teachers was 
spent in teaching subjects usually taught in academies and high schools; that the 
expectation that graduates of the normal school would become teachers of district 
schools had not been realized, because such graduates could command a larger salary 
than districts were able to pay; that consequently the district schools must secure 
their teachers from the union schools, academies, and high schools; and that it would 
be wise and economical to offer in the Albany school a course of study which should 
_prepare its graduates to become “‘ teachers and trainers of those persons in the union 
schoo.s, academies, and high schools who are to become the instructors of the young 
in small or sparsely settled communities.”

TEACHERS’ TRAINING CLASSES. 
The number of teachers employed in the public schools of New York is, according 
to the last report of the State superintendent (1891), 31,703. Reckoning the average 
professional life of a teacher at five years, the State requires at least 6,000 new teachers 
every year. The normal schools send out fewer than 1,000 graduates every year. 
Estimating the number of graduates and undergraduates of the normal schools who 
go into the schools as teachers at 1,500, there is still a large deficit of trained or partly 
trained teachers. How is this deficiency to be supplied? The answer has been 
already given—by establishing training classes in connection with the academies and 
union schools. The legislature in 1890 passed an ‘‘Act in regard to professional 
instruction of common-school teachers in academies and union schools,” and appro- 
priating $60,000 annually ‘‘for the instruction of competent persons in academies 
and union schools in the science and practice of common-school teaching, under a- 
course to be prescribed by the superintendent of public instruction,’? who is to 
designate the academies and union schools in which such instruction shall be given 
and also to prescribe for them a uniform curriculum. The purpose and scope of 
these training ses—they would have been called normal schools a few years 
before—will be best understood by reading the ‘“‘curriculum:”   
     
COURSE OF STUDY. 
The following course of study is prescribed upon the advice of a committee of 
principals representing the union schools and academies of the State. This course 
was devised to meet the requirements of the uniform system for teachers’ certificates

e Observation and practice work.] 
OBSERVATION AND PRACTICE WORK. 
1. The course of study devotes ten weeks each term to the special study of methods 
of teaching; during the first term, ten weeks to number and geography; during the 
second term, ten weeks to reading and language. Part of the time given to these topics 
must be spent in observation and practice work under the direction of the instructor of 
the class acting as critic. One consideration specially noted in granting applications 
is the opportunities afforded for observation and practice work, and it is insisted that 
these opportunities be improved. 
2. Observation. In addition to receiving methods of teaching on the authority of the 
instructor, it is very important that the members should be trained to critically observe 
and intelligently interpret the principles of teaching by being brought in contact with 
the pupils in the actual work of imparting instruction. To afford this training, it is 
expected that the critic teacher, at least twice a week, will give an opportunity to wit- 
ness practical work, either by taking the class to other departments of the school to 
observe the work of experienced teachers, or by bringing pupils from other depart- 
ments to receive a model lesson from the critic teacher. 
3. For practice work it is recommended that each member be given actual work in 
hing, both by taking charge of a class in other departments of the school as often 
as is consistent with the work of the school, and by having pupils brought before the 
training class to receive a lesson from a member designated for that purpose. 
4, At asubsequent recitation let this observation and practice work be reviewed by 
the critic teacher, the underlying principles ole brought out, and the proper 
methods forcibly presented. In the presentation of the methods the outlines as given 
in the syllabus may prove suggestive to the critic teacher. The time devoted to the 
observation work and the criticisms on the work will be accounted part of the regular 
daily periods of class instruction. 
5. Very much depends upon the instructor of these classes whether the instruction 
and practice driil are of proper grade and character. The number of graduates sent 
out each year from our normal schools is ample to furnish competent and thoroughly 
trained teachers to take charge of the classes. Duty to the common schools demands 
thoroughly trained teachers for this work. 
6. If the inspector in his visitations shall find any person in charge of the instruction 
who is not qualified by professional study or experience to properly present the work,

he is authorized to report the fact to the superintendent, who will amnul the appoint- 
ment to instruct such a class. 
SYLLABUS. 
The following outlines are presented to aid in the study of methods of teaching, as 
prescribed during the last ten weeks of each term. Inasmuch as the training classes 
are not all of the same grade of scholarship, these outlines are not given with the 
expectation that they are to be followed strictly to the letter, but rather as suggestions 
to teachers who have no better plan of work.

PHYSIOLOGY AND HYGIENE. 
I. Utility of the study: 
(1) Practical. 
(a) Knowledge of hygiene will affect personal habits and practices to 
some extent. 
(b) An intelligent conception of the body as a piece of delicate mech- 
anism tends to prevent its owner from trifling with it—one does 
not tinker with a fine watch, or entrust it to a blacksmith to be 
mended. Quacks and nostrums do not find favor with one that 
understands the body. : 
(c) Though a knowledge of hygienic laws does not always ensure their 
practice, yet that knowledge on the part of future parents and 
teachers, if well grounded in the apprehension of the perfection and 
complexity of the human machine, must tend to better hygienic 
management of children at home and at school. 
(2) Educational. 
(a) Affords opportunity for the study of things, as opposed to the study 
of words and abstractions—things in which pupils may be easily 
interested, and of which their parents will be glad to have them 
Jearn—thus training their powers of observation and comparison. 
(b) Serves as a center about which the teacher may group the begin- 
nings, and the most important elementary facts of biology, chem- 
istry, and physics. 
(c) Gives abundant exercise in tracing out adaptations of means to 
ends. 
(d) Develops the idea of analogy as distinguished from similarity.  
-P-A-G-E-1080
    2320 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
I. Utility of the study—Continued. 
(e) As the nomenclature of anatomy and physiology is tolerably pre- 
cise, recitations in these subjects give opportunity in older classes 
for the cultivation of accurate diction. In younger classes the 
propensity of bright children to delight in their ability to use 
new words, especially ‘‘hard names,” finds natural and healthy 
indulgence if the teacher makes sure that they first have the 
ideas, and then discreetly encourages them to acquire the names; 
avoiding any forcing. 
II. Suggestions to teachers: 
1) Teach objectively and by observation as much as possible. 
(2) Exhibit, when possible, the part or object described, taken from the 
lower animals, 
(3) For objective teaching of physiology great assistance is rendered by the. 
possession of a manikin, models, charts, microscope, and prepared 
specimens. 
(4) Encourage the pupils to invent simple experiments and to observe 
analogies from nature to illustrate the lesson. 
{5) Aim to present the laws of life in a practical way, so that they will 
become a guide to living. : 
(6) Teach physiology by a daily practice of hygienic laws. To allow pupils 
to sit in draughts, to pay no attention to ventilation and arrangement 
of light, to be careless in regard to diet, dress, and hours of sleep, 
teaches to little purpose. 
(7) Show clearly, without overstatement, the pernicious effect of alcohol 
and narcotics upon life and health, organ and function. = 
Ill. Method of work. Primary: 
(1) The study of physiology should be confined to parts that can be seen or 
felt. Names should be taught, and children should be exercised in 
“‘touching.”? -They should be led to discover the functions and 
adaptations of these parts, and to compare them with corresponding 
parts of lower animals. 
(2) All pictures or descriptions that would excite unpleasant thoughts or 
morbid fancies are out of place with young children. 
(3) Terms to be taught: 
    Head: forearm, root, Neck: 
trunk, radius, gum, throat, 
limbs, ulna, enamel, windpipe, 
right, wrist, incisors, Jarynx. 
left. palm, . eyeteeth, Breast: 
Legs: knuckles, molars, breast bone, 
ankle, thumb, tongue, ribs,

Shoulder: chin, bridge, veins.

In review teach names of corresponding parts of lower animals; e. g., stifle, 
hock, pastern, hoof, ete. 
(4) Lessons on the care of the eyes, ears, teeth, skin, hair, hands, and feet, 
should be given in connection with the study of those organs, and 
there should be talks about habits of eating, drinking, breathing,

III. Method of work—Primary—Continued. 
(5) Unfortunately, object lessons on the effects of aleohol are too sadly fre- 
quent in the vicinity of most of our schools. The attention of the 
children may be called to the melancholy and too plainly visible 
effects of intemperance upon the body, and they may be led to pity 
the sinner and detest the sin. But the utmost care must be used not 
to hurt the feelings of children that suffer from the drink habit in 
others. 
IV. Method of work. Intermediate: 
In graded schools the same general method of oral work may be continued 
through the intermediate years. The organs and processes of diges- 
tion, circulation, respiration, and excretion should be taught. Pupils 
should become familiar with the location and appearance of the 
organs by the use of pictures and charts or blackboard drawings, by 
touching those parts of their bodies beneath which these organs are 
situated, and particularly by examining the organs themselves as 
found in other animals. Functions should be explained in a general 
way, and the hygiene of the organs carefully taught. The effect of 
stimulants and narcotics should be emphasized, with care to avcid 
extravagant statements which the observation and experience of the 
children would contradict. 
Y. How to use a text-book: 
(1) Introduce each main topic and, as far as possible, each subdivision by 
the exhibition and examination of a real thing—bone, muscle, nerye, 
brain, skin, heart, artery, lung, stomach, liver, kidney, ete. si 
Recitation should be both topical and by question and answer; one 
method for advance, another for review. 
Make much use of the pictures and diagrams. Have them recited by 
blackboard memory sketches. 
Illustrate such terms as oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, p 
of the air, carbonic acid, osmose, etc., by simple chemical and phy 
experiments before these terms occur in the book. 
VI. How to use specimens: 
When fresh joints, etc., are used for illustration, take the utmost pains to 
secure neatness. Use dinner plates, plenty of tissue paper or white cloth, 
pins and needles. Cover every part except what is to be shown. Keep 
all covered till the proper time comes. Have water and clean towels 
handy. The exhibition of the muscles and nerves, and even of the organs 
of respiration, circulation, and digestion of a small, cleanly animal (e. ¢., 
a red squirrel), if well managed, arouses intense interest and is very 
instructive. 
VII. How to make models and illustrative apparatus. 
VIII. Reference books:

tions for demonstrations); Buckalew and Lewis’s Practical Work in the

  PENNSYLVANIA. 
Earty History. 
The normal fire, which was lighted at Lexington in 1839 and which smoldered 
in New York for some years after the death of Professor Page, did not reach Pennsyl- 
yania as a practical force until 1854. During the summer of that year a number of 
the citizens of Millersville and its vicinity, desiring a more liberal education for their 
children than was furnished by the common schools of the neighborhood, erected a 
building for the purpose of accommodating a school, which they proposed to call 
 
-P-A-G-E-1086
  2326 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
“The Millersville Academy.”” This building was offered to the late Prof. James P. 
Wickersham, then county superintendent, for the purpose of holding a teachers’ 
institute for three months. The attendance at the institute was so large and the 
general results so satisfactory that the trustees resolved to enlarge their building and 
establish a regular normal school. 
The legislature had passed a law in 1857 granting certain privileges to such private 
institutions as would comply with the requisitions of the law and engage in the 
work of training teachers. Among these requisitions were the following: That each 
normal school established under the law should possess ground to the extent of 10 
acres; a hall, capable of seating 1,000 persons, and boarding accommodations for at 
least 300 students. The trustees and stockholders of the Millersville Academy at a 
public meeting voted ‘‘that it is expedient to so enlarge the grounds attached to the 
school and to make such additions to the building connected therewith as to bring 
the school within the requirements of the act of assembly of May, 1857,” already 
referred to. The institution was continued as a permanent county normal school 
until it obtained official recognition as a State normal school in December, 1859. 
But the ‘‘normal idea”? had taken root in Pennsylvania long before the fruit 
appeared. Ina letter to the chairman of the joint committee on education (session 
of 1833), the Rey. George Junkin, president of Lafayette College, at Easton, writes 
as follows, in answer to a query of the committee: 
  Are your teachers formed or prepared in the common schools or have you model 
schools for them? In prosecuting this inquiry it may be best to state distinctly the 
thing desired, or, in other words, define a good teacher; and I suppose three qualifi- 
cations to be indispensable: (1) The art of governing a school. (2) The art of com- 
municating knowledge. (3) The knowledge to be communicated. These are set 
down in what I take to be the order of their importance, but they are all equally 
indispensable. * * * The capacity of a teacher to train other minds will very 
much depend on the systematic accuracy to which his own mind has been subjected 
in its training. The art of communicating must be deeply affected by the practice 
of acquiring and the habits formed by that practice. These remarks all go to evince 
the necessity of a model school, in which shall be taught the science—that is, the 
knowledge of letters and other things to be taught to the children in our common 
schools, and the arts of communicating and governing. It does appear to me imposs 
ble to obtain the right kind of teachers, and in adequate numbers, without it. This 
point settled, our next business is to settle a plan of attaining this object, and here I 
know of but three projects: (1) A manual. labor academy near Harrisburg, under 
the immediate direction of the State authorities, in which 100 of the future teachers 
are to be pupils. [Here follow five weighty objections to this plan.] (2) The 
establishment of model schools, without manual labor, where the future teacher 
shall be taught on the best plans. We have settled the question of model schools; 
they are necessary, and chiefly with reference to practical training in the difficult 
matters of government and discipline. Without an actual school of children, you 
have no model at all, be the building and fixtures and apparatus and teacher ever so 
perfect. There lies, then, in the very nature of the case, this necessity, to wit: You 
must have a school to teach the science, and another school to teach, by the living 
thing itself, the arts of government and practical details. Now these are furnished, 
and the only remaining or third project or plan, which is that of establishing, in the 
existing colleges of our State, model schools, a teachers’ course. This project has in 
its favor the plea of perfect simplicity, and may be explained in a few words: 
(1) Let each college fix upon a liberal course of studies for school-teachers, and - 
constitute a new degree in graduation. 
(2) Let a common school, to be kept full of children from the neighborhood, in 
every respect such as is desirable to see in every district of the State, be established 
contiguous to the college buildings, which school shall be a model in its buildings, 
fixtures, desks, books, apparatus, rules and regulations, and mode of management. 
(3) Let the candidate for the collegiate honor of a school teacher’s diploma be 
in every respect on the same footing in college with other students—study in the 
same class his own particular branches, submit to the same system of discipline, and 
let him in addition to these spend a part of every day in the common school as a 
spectator, and occasionally as an assistant. 
(4) When he shall have completed his course, which will take two years, let 
him pass a final examination and, if approved, receive the honorable testimony of 
the board of trustees.   
   
 
-P-A-G-E-1087
  NORMAL SCHOOLS IN THE UNITED STATES. 2327 
(5) Let every teacher thus qualified, who shall teach within. the State, receive, 
besides the provision made for his support by the people, a yearly allowance from 
the school fund for every year he shall teach in one place. 
The Doctor proceeds to give in six paragraphs what he conceives to be the advan- 
tages of this ‘project.’ No clearer statement has since been made of the way in 
which a university chair of pedagogy may be employed for the preparation of 
teachers of common schools. Beyond this the pioneers of normal training had not 
at that time ventured. 
Pennsylvania claims ‘‘to have been the first of our American States to inaugurate 
the work of preparing teachers.” If by ‘‘preparing teachers’ is meant the fur- 
nishing of teachers with sufficient knowledge of the subjects taught in common 
schools, the claim is somewhat vague, as every good school or college does the same. 
If it means that Pennsylvania was the first to establish an institution whose princi- 
pal object was to give instruction in the science and art of teaching and the mode of 
organizing and governing schools, the claims of Massachusetts must be considered. 
“The University of Pennsylvania, begun as an academy in 1749, was designed par- 
tially as a school for teachers. Dr. Franklin, the chief among its founders, in 
addressing the common council of the city for aid in its behalf, states that as the 
country is suffering greatly for want of competent schoolmasters, the proposed 
academy will be able to furnish a supply of such as are ‘of good morals and known 
character’ and can ‘teach children reading, writing, arithmetic, and the grammar of 
their mother tongue.’’’! The good Doctor had evidently no conception of a normal 
school as we now understand the term. The Western Boarding School, established 
by the Society of Friends in 1799, made a report in 1824, announcing that ‘“‘several 
of both sexes have so profited by the course of studies and the mode of instruction 
thus derived as to be qualified for teachers of schools in many parts of the country.” 
The Moravian School, established in 1807 at Nazareth Hall, had ‘‘a special depart- 
ment for the preparation of teachers, in which young men received such instruction 
as qualified them either to teach in schools established at home, or to open and con- 
duct schools in the missionary field.’”’ Dr. Benjamin Rush, in an address to the 
legislature in 1786, favored ‘“‘the establishment of a system of free schools, of one 
university at Philadelphia, and of three colleges, one at Carlisle, one at Lancaster, 
and one at Pittsburg,’ and added, ‘‘the university will in time furnish masters for the 
colleges, and the colleges will furnish masters for the free schools.’’ In all this there 
seems to be an intention to make scholars who might or might not afterwards be- 
come teachers, but there is no intimation that more than scholarship was needed. 
In 1838 the trustees of Lafayette College erected a building for a model school, placed 
a distinguished Scotch educator at the head of it, and established a teachers’ course. 
But the people were not as yet educated up to this point and the project failed. 
The city of Philadelphia has the credit of establishing the first city training school 
in this country. The Philadelphia Model School, as it was called, was inaugurated 
in 1818 expressly as a teachers’ school, for the purpose of qualifying teachers ‘‘ior 
the sectional schools and for schools in other parts of the State.’ The name 
“Model’’ was imported from England, where it was used to designate a school in 
which young persons could observe and practice the art of teaching. The Philadel- 
phia Model School was a necessary adjunct of the Lancasterian system, which pre- 
yailed in that city until 1836, and in a modified form until 1848. 
       
  CoLuEcEes As Preparatory ScHooLs. 
The plan of utilizing the colleges of the State as preparatory schools for teachers— 
they can not be called ‘‘training schools’’—was followed for more than a quarter of 
a century, and with the same results as in New York.

-P-A-G-E-1088
  2328 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99, 
In 1831, Washington College received from the State an appropriation of $500 a 
year for fiye years on condition “‘that the trustees shall cause that there be instructed 
annually, gratis, 20 students in the elementary branches of education, in a manner 
best calculated to qualify them to teach common English schools.” 
In 1832, Jefferson College was given $2,000 a year for four years on condition that 
“6 students in indigent circumstances should be educated gratuitously for four 
years,”’ and thereafter 24 students should be prepared for teachers of common schools. 
In the same year Reading Academy received $3,000, with the stipulation that 4 
poor students be educated for five years, free of expense of tuition, for teachers of 
common English schools. 
In 1834, Pennsylvania College was given $3,000 a year for six years on condition 
that 15 young men students should be prepared for teachers. 
In 1837, Marshall College received a grant of $2,000 a year for two years on con- 
dition that 20 students be prepared for teachers of the English language. 
In the same year Allegheny College received a grant of $2,000 a year for four years, 
for which were to be instructed annually 12 students, free of expense, for'teachers in 
the English language. 
“But the experiment of educating teachers in the colleges failed,” says Dr. Wicker- 
sham, ‘‘because there was not then much demand for teachers thus prepared, and for 
the stronger reason that the general work of a college and the special work of a 
teachers’ school can never be made to harmonize.’”’ State Superintendent Burrows, 
in his report for 1838, says, ‘‘The colleges have already been tried as a means of 
supplying teachers, and with little success. * * * Hope from this quarteris dead.’”’? 
The present writer may add as his own experience that a semicollegiate education 
is the worst possible introduction to the teaching now required in the common country 
schools. Few teachers and few schools survive the experiment. 
  ProressionaL Norman Scnoots RecommMEnpep. 
In 1838 Superintendent Burrows abandoned the plan of educating teachers in 
departments connected with colleges and academies and advocated the establish- 
ment of separate free institutions for the instruction of teachers, in which they should 
receive ‘‘a full and careful course of theoretic and practical instruction in the art of 
teaching.’”? Superintendent Haines in 1849 advocated the establishment of a normal 
school in each county and a central institution of the same character, but of higher 
grade, for the whole State. Superintendent Curtin in 1857 recommended in sub- 
stance the provisions of the act which was passed by the legislature in that year for 
the est: hment of normal schools. In drafting this bill and carrying it through 
the legislature, Dr. Wickersham, then principal ‘of the normal school at Millersville, 
was the leading and guiding spirit. THis good judgment, energy, zeal, and practical 
success as a teacher, as county superintendent and State superintendent, caused the 
example which he set in the second district to be followed rapidly by several of the 
other normal districts, and ultimately by all but one. 
  Law ror EsraBiishMent or State Norman ScHoo.s. 
For normal purposes the State was divided into thirteen districts, in each of which 
one normal school might be established under the law of 1857, before referred to, and 
additional enactments passed in 1859, 1872, 1875, and 1879. The pecuniary and other 
affairs of each State normal school are managed by a board of 18 trustees, 12 elected 
by the contributors or stockholders and 6 appointed by the State superintendent of 
public instruction. All changes in by-laws and rules for regulating proceedings of 
these boards must be approved by the State superintendent before going into effect. 
The State appropriations made directly to normal schools are distributed through a

commission, consisting of the governor, the superintendent of public instruction, and 
the attorney-general, in such a manner as to do exact and equal justice to the severa 
schools.!_ Each school is required to have at least six professors of liberal education 
and known ability in their respective departments: One of orthography, reading, and 
elocution; one of writing, drawing, and bookkeeping; one of arithmetic and the 
higher branches of mathematics; one of geography and history; one of grammar and 
English literature, and one of theory and practice of teaching, together with such 
professors, assistants, and tutors as the condition of the school may require. Every 
school is required to have attached to it one or more schools for practice, or model 
schools, with not less than 100 pupils, in which the students of the normal schools 
may haye an opportunity to acquire a practical knowledge of the art of teaching. 
The qualifications for admission and the course of study are by law uniform in all 
the schools and are determined by a convention of the principals, subject to approval 
by the State superintendent. 
The following notices are taken with much abridgment from the reports of princi- 
pals of State normal schools to the State superintendent of public instruction and will 
be found in full in the last (1891) annual report of the superintendent, pages 183- 
198. The items in the footnotes are excerpted from the latest accessible catalogues 
of the several schools: 
First District, West Cuesrer (G. M. Philips, principal).—There has been no 
interruption in the prosperity of our school during the past year. Every year sees a 
substantial but healthy growth in our numbers, and, as usual, we report that the 
attendance during the past year has been the largest i in the school’s history. oe 
The work in the gymnasium has been carried on with marked success. The phys- 
ical measurements of our students at the end of the year, when compared with the 
measurements of the same students at the beginning of the year, showed marked 
improvement in almost eyery case. * * * Our post-graduate course has proved 
to be a marked success. It will be of great value ip furnishing higher schools with 
competent, well-qualified teachers. * * * Many new books have been placed 
upon the shelves of the library, the number of volumes now reaching about si

school’s history, and the tenth of my principalship.” 
Srconp District, MILLERSVILLE (E. Oram Lyte, principal).—The prosperity of this 
school,is still increasing, the attendance last year being the largest in history. 
The total number of students for the summer session was 772 (386 of each sex), and 
1,225 for the year. The graduating class numbered 72, all of whom obtained good 
positions as teachers, except a few who have returned to complete the scientific 
course. * * * One of the most important improvements made during the past 
year was the completion of the large gymnasium. The style of architecture of the 
building is Romanesque. The lower floor contains three rooms, entirely separated 
from each other. One of these contains the bowling and pitching alleys, and the 
others are each provided with lockers and bathing accommodations. On the main 
floor are the reception room, examination room, and the large room for exercising 
purposes, with elevated walking track, ete. The gymnasium is completely furnished 
with the latest and most approved apparatus. Two teachers are constantly engaged.

the organization of each till June 1, 1891, was $1,520,000. 
2The West Chester State Normal School was founded in the year 1871 by joint efforts of the trustees 
of the West Chester Academy and the citizens of West Chester and vicinity. The main building is 
new, built of greenstone and marble, 256 by 234 feet, four stories high with basement. It is one 
of the finest and handsomest school buildings in the country. A first-class gymnasium, 104 by 64 
feet, is just being finished. It is of stone, two stories high, and is fitted up with every modern im- 
provement, including a full supply of the best apparatus, running track, bathrooms, large swimming 
pool, bowling alleys, ball cage,ete. With the single exception of Harvard’s, it is the largest gy 
sium in America, and is believed to be, without any exception, the best and most complete gymnas 
connected with any school or college in the United States. The school property has now cost upward 
of a third of a million of dollars. The number of different students during the year (1889-90) was 709, 
of whom 395 were ladies and 314 gentlemen. (Nineteenth Annual Catalogue of the West Chester 
State Normal School, 1890).

It now contains nine grades, beginning with the kindergarten and ending with the 
advanced grammar grade.! 
Turrp Disrricr, Kurzrown (Nathan C. Schaeffer, principal).—The new wing was 
ready for occupation at the opening of the spring term. The class rooms in it, 
equipped with all the latest improvements, added greatly to the efficiency of our 
work. We were thereby enabled to reduce the size of our classes. When students 
recite in sections numbering from 20 to 30 they can complete a course of several 
years in a session or two less than it takes if they recite in classes numbering from 
50 to 75. Mental growth is greatly stimulated by daily individual contact with live 
teachers. Probably the greatest need of our Pennsylvania normal schools is a faculty 
paid by the State. This would lead to free tuition, smaller classes, a standard of 
scholarship for admission, and would put an end to the strained relations that some- 
times result from undue competition.” 
Fieri Disrricr, Mansrreip (D. C. Thomas, principal).—Six hundred and twenty- 
nine students were enrolled during the past year. Of these, 93 graduated in the 
elementary course, 2 in the scientific, and 12 in music. The accommodations in our 
ladies’ building were not sufficient for the constantly increasing attendance of that 
sex. An addition to the present building is in process of construction. When done, 
it will be a magnificent structure. The work will cost at least $100,000. 
Sixrm Disrricr, Broomssure (J. P. Welsh, principal).—The year just closed has 
added another year of success to the history of this institution. The attendance 
has been greater than ever before; the senior class was the largest ever graduated 
here, and was composed of young men and women of exceptional promise as teachers. 
One hundred and five certificates of admission to the next senior class were issued to 
juniors at the close of the year, while 37 applicants for this certificate were rejected 
by the faculty. * * * In September last the manual-training department was 
organized, and was placed under the management of a teacher who received special 
training for the work. Under his direction this department has been a marked suc- 
cess. Students, grading from the model school to the senior class, received instruc- 
tion in the nature and uses of tools and materials. A series of graded lessons has 
been arranged for this purpose, which terminate in the senior year with wood cary- 
ing and the construction of useful articles, such as philosophical and mathematical 
apparatus needed in schools. *° * * The classes of 1891 and 1892 have presented 
to the school a set of gymnastic apparatus, consisting of chest weights, intercostal 
machines, parallel bars, vaulting bars, wrist machines, flying rings, quarter circles, 
giant strides, boxing gloves, striking bags, ete. * * * I believe that the profes- 
sional character of the normal schools would be elevated if, in every instance, all 
applicants for the normal certificate were examined in actual teaching. 
               
    ihe normal school buildings are large, the east front being 852 feet and the south front 160 feet, and conveniently arranged in every respect. There are boarding accommodations for 400, and school accommodations for 800 students,” The buildings are surrounded with grounds to the extent of ten acres, which have been tastefully laid out and are used for play and pleasure grounds, The value of the buildings, grounds, furniture, ete., is more than $250,000, The institution is well supplied with philosophical apparatus, and posesses also a good eabinet of mineralogical, geological, and ornitho- jogianl specimens. The total number of students from the opening of the school to the close of the year in 1888 was 22,184, and the number of graduates 905, The number of volumes in hbrary, i h Annual Catalogue of the Pennsylvania State Normal School at Millersville, 
     ter County.) 2 There is a striking resemblance between the origin of the Kutztown Normal School and that of 
the normal school at Millersville. Both owed their beginning to the efforts of the respective county 
superintendents, John S. Ermentrout and James P.Wickersham. Both commenced as summer normal 
schools. Both were developments of neighborhood academies, Before the organization of the Kutz- 
town school there existed in Kutztown and the neighborhood mere academies or seminaries under 
the control of a limited number of stockholders—the Franklin Academy, the Fairview Academy, and 
atawny Seminary. But the people demanded better education, and were willing to embark in 
y enterprise that promised to improve their schools. As the county superintendent was traveling rom Lyons to Kutztown, he saw in the distance the building known as Maxatawny Seminary. It 
occurred to him that, if the people of this section had taken sufficient interest in the cause of educa- 
tion to erect that building, they might be induced to assist him in carrying out his project of estab- lishing a regular State normal school for the Third normal district. In 1865 the teachers were invited 
to attend a county normal school in Maxatawny Semina: Students flocked thither from every part 
of the county and from adjacent districts, and the seminary was found to be too small for their 
accommodation. This inspired the people with a determination to erect such buildings as the school 
law requires and to establish a regular normal school for the Third normal district. (Historical 
Sketch of Kutztown and Maxatawny, by John S. Ermentrout, 1876.) 
8 The school property attracts much attention. It is at an elevation of over 150 feet above the Sus- 
quehanna. The view from this elevation is almost unriyaled. Fourteen acres of campus afford ample space for lawns and athletic ground, and include a beautiful oak grove of 3) acres. The three main 
buildings are of brick—one is the dormitory, two are devoted to school work. Institute hall contains 
an auditorium capable of seating 900 persons. The dining room is 109 by 40 feet, and will accommo- 
date over 300 guests. The manual-training room is 40 feet square, and contains benches and tools for the accommodation of 30 pupils at a time. About 250 pupils, at different periods of the day, pass for instruction to this department. They are taught here the structure and uses of different

Seventh District, SHiprenssurc (G. M. D. Eckles, principal).—The year just 
closed has been one of unusual prosperity for the Cumberland Valley State Normal 
School. There has been a considerable increase in the patronage of the school, and 
we believe a marked improvement in the character of the work done. We grad- 
uated fourscore young men and women from our school this year, by far the largest 
class in its history. This increase in numbers has not been secured by any sacrifice 
of the standard of qualifications fixed by the school. In our junior class the grade 
of qualifications has been raised, and we expect to continue the raising of our stand- 
ard with this class from year to year, as the raising of the standard of the juniors is 
necessarily followed by a corresponding raising of the standard of the seniors. 
Nearly all the dormitories have been painted and ornamented with neat designs. 
The designs for the room decorations were all made by students and by those con- 
nected with the school.! 
Ereurn Disrricr, Locks (James Eidon, principal).—The Central State 
Normal School is now fully established in itsnew home. During the year which 
ended July 2, 1891, every room in the building was occupied, two in a room, and 
many boarders had to be accommodated with lodgings in adjacent buildings. At 
the last commencement 44 graduated in the elementary course, and 90 juniors were 
admitted to the senior class. Several of the graduates before the term closed were 
elected to responsible positions as principals of schools.” 
Ninra Disrrict, Ixprana (Z. X. Snyder, principal).—Growth characterizes the 
living. From this standpoint the Indiana normal is a living institution. During 
the year it has grown in every direction—scholastically, professionally, in efficiency, 
in teaching power, and in numbers. The annual attendance was 790. * * * The 
erection of a greenhouse has aided very materially in the beautifying of the grounds. 
* * * One hundred guns were received from the State for the purpose of military 
drill. * * * In our industrial department three types of work are done: Kinder- 
garten, sloid, and manual training. * * * A number of good microscopes were 
purchased for the science department. * * * The model school has passed from 
a mere practice school to a model school in the true sense. It is a school where 
experts teach, enabling the juniors and seniors to observe. * * * The trustees 
contemplate the erection of a gymnasium. It will be commenced in the spring. 
* % * The classes of 1889 and 1890 erected a beautiful fountain on the campus.® 
Taenxra Disrricr, Cairornia (Theo. B. Noss, principal).—Our attendance of stu- 
dents was larger than ever before, reaching a total of 711, of whom 502 are in the 
kinds of wood, the nature of each tool, and the principle on which it works; they then make a draw- 
ing, afterwards an object to correspond, and finally give an oral or written description of the object. * % % Lessonsare given in shorthand and typewriting. * * * An athletic association, composed of students, has charge of all outdoor sports, such as baseball, tennis, football, and the like. The 
ladies are drilled in wand and dumb-bell exercises, and have organized several walking clubs. (Cir- 
cular of the State Normal School of Bloomsburg, Pa., 1891.) 
I'he last catalogue (1890-91) claims for thé Shippensburg school the following among other advantages: 1. We employ none but high-grade teachers. * * * All our teachers are specialis departments. 2. Our school is thoroughly and properly disciplined. * * * We hold ourselves responsible for the moral as well as the intellectual development of our students. 
3. We lay great stress on the professional training of our students. * * * The pra 
in the model school is under skillful supervision and competent direction. 
4, Our school is organized in the interest of the students. Our system of classification enables us 
to advance students as rapidly as their progress will permit. No person is held in check to accommo- date the interests of dull and inattentive scholars 
5. Our graduates are distinguished by their originality, being something more than blind imitators. 6. Our school is not crowded beyond its capac’ 7. Our graduates are doing noble work in thei 
ing good positions for them. 
Ji. We do not claim to have the best school in the country, but we do claim that there is none 
ter. ‘This school was founded in 1871, but was not open for the admission of students until the fall of 
1877. In December, 1888, the fine building occupied by the school from its organization was totally 
destroyed by fire, but the work of instruction was carried on without interruption in a large hotel 
building, fitied up for the purpose. In May, 1890, the new building was occupied, 200 students being present. To the erection of this building the State contributed $105,000. It is of brick, with brown- 
stone trimmings, and has three distinct parts. It is lighted at night’by 450 electric lamps, The training school is composed of children from 5 to6 years of age. These are divided into classes 
so as to represent every grade of teaching required in the publie schools of the State, from the dergarten to the high school. The time given to the practice of teaching is not less than forty-five minutes each day for twenty-one consecutive weeks. All students receive class instruction in Yocal music. Lessons ‘are also given, at an extra charge, on the piano, organ, violin, cornet, and other instruments. There are two literary societies, each haying its own hall, library, and reading room. The art department offers instruction in oil painting, china painting, portrait painting, and sketching. ft Principals.—Albert N. Raub, 1877-1884; George P, Beard, 1884-1857; James Eldon, 1887.

normal department and 209 in the model school. A new building is now in course 
of erection. It will be used for the model school, for the sloid shop, and for the 
natural science department. The large attic story of this building, which is 86 by 
56 feet in size, will be fitted up as a gymnasium. Our graduating class this year 
consisted of 18 gentlemen and 17 ladies; most of these have already secured desira- 
ble positions as teachers for the coming year.1 
Exeventn Disrricr, Suiprery Rock (Albert E. Maltby, principal).—The normal 
school at Slippery Rock has just closed a very successful school year. The increased 
attendance under adverse circumstances is certainly very encouraging, and the future 
seems bright with indications of continued growth and prosperity. Our last gradu- 
ating class numbers 12. * * * Over 500 pupils were in attendance during the 
year, and the class-room accommodations were taxed to their utmost extent. * * * 
The plans for a new building have been drawn, and work will begin immediately. 
The structure will be in brick, handsomely ornamented with stone, and will contain 
class rooms, society halls, reading rooms, music rooms, parlors, library, gymnasium, 
offices, and principal’s residence. The total cost is estimated at $50,000. * * * 
Every effort is being made to bring out the beautiful in our campus and school 
grounds. An addition of some 5 acres, and the planting of many valuable trees have 
done much toward improyement in appearance. The ball field is unsurpassed by 
that of any other school.” 
Twetrra Disrricr, Eprnsoro (Martin E. Benedict, principal).—The past school year 
closed the 3d of July. There were 89 graduates. One hundred received junior cer- 
tificates. * * * ‘The average age of the class was 22 yearsand 8 months. Over 60 
had taught inthe publicschools. Nearly all have entered the schoolroom as teachers, 
and they received from $40 to $100 a month. * * * In the model school, 60 stu- 
dents can practice a day, one class each. * * * The library occupies a room 50 
by 65 feet, andis open daily from8 o’clocka. m. until4.15 p.m. Thebooks are inopen 
cases and all students are free to take books from the cases, The librarian is in con- 
stant attendance. * * * In recitation the students stand at the blackboard with 
chalk and pointer, or directly before the class, and in their own language give the 
substance of the lesson.* 
Tuirreenta District, Ciarton (A. J. Davis, principal).—This school completed 
the fourth year of its history without any remarkable changes or innovations. The 
stringency of the times affected the population of the district with peculiar force, and    
  
1 Number of students—413 normal, 229 model. On the 11th of April, 1890, the school celebrated the twenty-fifth anniversary of its opening under the charter name of South Western Normal College. It is the outgrowth of an academy first opened in 1852, From the time the success of the experi- ment at Millersville, in 1855, became known, the undertaking of a similar enterprise at California 
se roel yia a sed and was finally achieved (1874). (Catalogue of the State Normal School at Cal- 
ifornia, 1891. 2During the autumn of 1887 the question of organizing a school in the town was agitated. The 
project found many friends and soon assumed definite form. A meeting was called at which it was 
determined to erect a building and open an academy. The community canvassed for money to 
erect a building and support a school until it should become self-sustaining. While this work was 
in progress the discovery was made that there was no normal school in the district. A second 
meeting was called, at which it was resolved to erect the necessary buildings and apply for recog- nition as the State Normal School of the Eleventh district. In the spring of 1888 an organization was 
effected, a charter obtained, and the erection of the buildings was begun. In the spring of 1889 the buildings were completed and inspected by the committee appointed by the State, who unanimously 
recommended the ‘‘recognition” of the school as the State Normal School of the Eleventh district. 
The number of students on the catalogue of 1890-91 was 340 in the normal department and 160 in the 
model school. 
8 Means employed to train teachers.—These are study, recitation, reading, observation, practice, and 
instruction. The value of study varies, ceteris paribus: (1) As the time spent in the study; (2) as the square of the engergy; @) as the square of the interest; (4) as the cube of the methods; (5) as the fourth power of the quality; (6) as the spirit of willing obedience. Students in the normal school recite as teachers. They receive no help. Each member of the class 
while others are reciting is both pupil and critic. The normal school teachers aim to act as model 
teachers, and thus student teachers, even unconsciously at recitation, become acquainted with methods of teaching. 
The library is rich in works upon teaching, and students are taught to select, read, and digest the thoughts of educational writers. ¢ 
The library occupies a room in the new building 50 by 65 fect. It is opened daily from 8 a. m. until 4.15 p.m. The students learn to know books and to énjoy reading them. They are taught to read with profit, and are referred to the manual of reading among the reference books. The books are classified as follows: (1) Works of reference; (2) works upon teaching; (3) periodical literature. Two literary societies, the Potter and the Everett, hold regular sessions Saturday afternoons. Each ocupics a pleasant and well-furnished hall 25 by 40 feet. All students are free to join or not, as each 
refers, e A musical department has been organized whose aim is to prepare teachers for leading the music 
in public schools, and for skill in teaching music. Especial attention is given to the cultivation of a 
musical touch an¢ a correct interpretation of the standard works. The department offers two 
courses, (1) a course for the thorough training of teachers; (2) a course for persons Wishing to become 
skilled singers. The number of normal pupils is 670, of whom 345 are reported as ‘‘ unclassified.” The model school 
numbers 208.

The course of study in the State normal schools of Pennsylvania is intended to be 
uniform and is prescribed by a convention of principals, aided by the State superin- 
tendent; but as the order in which the legal studies are to be pursued is not pre- 
scribed, and the number and kind of additional studies are not limited, each school 
maintains a distinct personality, notwithstanding the basis of uniformity. The legal 
course and one of the catalogue courses (Bloomsburg) are given below :

The Pennsylvania normal schools are not free schools. The local boarding-school 
element from which most if not all of them were “‘evolved’’ rendered it imprudent 
to make tuition free; but by an act of the legislature the following appropriations 
are made by the State of Pennsylvania to normal students and graduates: 
  1. Each student over 17 years of age who shall sign a declaration of intention to 
teach in the common schools of this State shall receive the sum of 50 cents per week. 
2. Each student over 17 years of age who was disabled in the military or naval 
service of the United States, or of Pennsylvania, or whose father lost his life in said 
service, and who shall sign an agreement as above, shall receive the sum of $1 per 
week. 
8. Each student, who, upon graduation shall sign an agreement to -teach in the 
common schools of the State two full years shall receive the sum of $50. 
4. Any student to receive these benefits must attend the school at least one term 
of twelve consecutive weeks, and receive instruction in the theory and practice of 
teaching. 
The amount expended under this act in the school year ending June 1, 1891, was 
$47,875.25.

    2336 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99, 
NEW JERSEY. 
Earty History. 
In 1825 Philip Lindsay, D. D., acting president of the College of New Jersey, advo- 
cated the establishment of teachers’ seminaries, for these among other reasons: 
That at present the great mass of our teachers are mere adventurers; either young 
men who are looking forward to some less laborious and more respectable vocation, 
and who, of course, have no ambition to excel in the business of teaching and no 
motive to exertion but immediate and temporary relief from pecuniary embarrass- 
ment, or men who despair of doing better or who have failed in other pursuits, or 
who are wandering from place to place, teaching a year here and a year there, and 
gathering up what they can from the ignorance and credulity of their employers. 
Three years later Prof. John Maclean, afterwards president of the University of 
New Jersey, recommended, in a lecture on the school system of the State, ‘the 
establishment of an institution to educate young men for the business of teaching.””! 
Nineteen years after this (1847) a convention of the friends of education in Bur- 
lington County, N. J., was held at Mount Holly. A committee on business was 
appointed, who reported a series of resolutions in favor of the establishment of a State 
normal school. The resolutions were fully discussed, but in order to afford time for 
further deliberation the convention adjourned to meet in the same place on the 2d 
of December. Atthisadjourned meeting letters of approval and congratulation were 
read from the following eminent public men: William H. Seward, of New York;? Rev. 
William H. Campbell, secretary of the executive committee of the State normal school 
at Albany;* Bishop Potter, of Pennsylvania;* Joseph R. Chandler, editor of the United 
States Gazette;> Horace Mann, of Massachusetts;* Edward Everett;? John G. Pal- 
1Report of the United States Commissioner of Education, 1868. 
*The advantages resulting from the professional education of teachers in what are called normal 
schools are universally conceded among the friends of education in this State. If I had ever doubted 
on this subject, all my doubts would have been remoyed by the experiment of the institution in this 
city (Albany), which has been eminently successful. The ultimate operation of normal schools will 
be to elevate the standard of public education and, of course, the dignity of those to whom its labors 
are confided. (Report on normal schools to the convention of the friends of education, Burlington, 
N. J., 1847. 
8T had doubts when our normal school was first started as to the necessity of such an institution 
among us; but my opinion is entirely changed. * * * Ihave become convinced of the great value 
of the normal school. My conviction is the result of actual observation, and from this I feel justified 
ing that a normal school is indispensable in carrying out any State educational system. * * * I hope soon to hear that New Jersey has instituted a State normal school. (Ib.) 
4T rejoice to hear that the State of New Jersey is moving in respect to the education and training 
of teachers for common schools. It is beyond doubt the most essential step in the great work of 
improving and, as it were, of regenerating our system of common-school instruction. * * * The 
stablishment of the State normal school was therefore looked forward to as the essential complement 
to allother plans. (Ib.) 
5 While all other professions and pursuits have their appropriate schools and other means of prepar- 
ation for the duties of their calling, why should the teacher alone be neglected? Why should he be 
allowed to try experiments upon our children until he has learned how to teach, wasting the precious 
time of our youth by the timidity naturally resulting from his want of practice, or destroying their 
tempers by the restlessness of one who has never learned to have command over himself? * * * I 
really believe that the important scheme of public schools can not be carried out as it should be with- 
out trained teachers. (Ib.) 
SI regard normal schools as the one indispensable thing for carrying forward a system of common 
schools, * * * How it can happen that a man shall need to serve an apprenticeship to make a 
boot, but can instruct and train a child by instinct is more than I can comprehend, (Ib.) 
TIt affords me much pleasure to hear that fou are taking measures for the establishment of a nor- 
mal school in New Jersey. * * * Itseems quite evident that the art of teaching—an art so difficult 
and so important—should require some special training for itsattainment. If it did not, it would dif- 
fer from all other intellectual arts. * * * The fact is that hardly any teacher is, as such, seli- 
formed. He employs, asan instructor, the methods which were in use at the school where he received, 
his own education some ycars—perhaps a gccd many years—before. His teacher, in like manner 
probably followed traditionary methods. Such a course can result in nothing but the perpetuation 
of errors, and must end in degeneracy. (Ib.)

superintendent of common schools;? Dayid P. Page,* principal of the New York nor- 
mal school at Albany. 
The business committee reported a forcible and logical argument in favor of estab- 
lishing a State normal school, and answering the most plausible objections. 
(1) As to the expense. 
(2) As to the difficulty of securing the services of the graduates of the normal 
school to the business of instruction in the State. 
(8) As to the allegations that there is no necessity for normal schools, inasmuch 
as the business of instruction, like other social and private wants, is regulated by the 
commercial law of supply and demand. 
(4) As to the assertion that it is not so much teachers that we need, nor schools 
for the education of teachers, as it is a higher compensation for their services. 
(5) As to the apprehension that a due measure of religious instruction and influ- 
ence can not be reconciled with the exclusion of sectarianism. 
(6) That normal schools are an importation from Prussia, a monarchy, a despot- 
ism, well enough adapted to such a Government, but unsuited to the genius and 
temper of ours. 
Time having thoroughly refuted the objections, the cogent and eloquent answers: 
given in the report may be omitted here; but one is tempted to imagine that Bryant 
wrote ‘‘ Zrror crushed to earth will rise again”? when one recalls the fact that thirty- 
seven years after this report was written the sixth objection was strongly but inef- 
fectually urged in the legislature of a neighboring State by the son of a German Jew. 
The report was accepted and the accompanying resolutions adopted seriatim with- 
out a single dissenting voice; yet it was not till the year 1855 that an act was passed) 
by the legislature of New Jersey containing the following sections: 
There shall be a normal school or seminary for the training and education of 
teachers in the art of instructing and governing the common schools of this State, 
the object of which school or seminary shall be the training and education of its 
pupils in such branches of knowledge and such methods of teaching and governing: 
as will qualify them. for teachers of our common schools. 
The board of trustees are authorized to maintain a model school under permanent. 
teachers in which the pupils of the normal school shall have opportunity to observe 
and practice the modes of instruction and discipline inculcated in the normal school, 
and in which pupils may be prepared for the normal school. 
The act appropriated $10,000 annually to the support of the school, but no pro- 
vision was made for a site or buildings. It was left to the people to supply by vol- 
untary action the means for which no provision had been made by the legislature. 
This appeal to the people met with a warm and generous response. New Brunswick, 
Beverly, Orange, Trenton, and other places made liberal offers. After careful delib- 
eration the trustees selected Trenton, where, by the liberality of the citizens, a large-

school libraries. I did more for others’ good that day than in all the rest of my life put together. 
(Report on normal schools to the convention of the friends of education, Burlington, N. J., 1847.) 
2It is now nearly nine years since I have been connected with the common-school system of New 
York. It was during the six preceding years, under my official superintendence, and it was among 
the first objects of my execution to improve the education of teachers; for without competent instruct- 
ors schools are of very little use. * * * You will infer that I am very decidedly in favor of nor— 
mal schools for the education of teachers. (Ib.) 
8In our State there is no doubt in the public mind but that teachers should be specially educated. 
The question now started is, Ought they to be educated by the State? * * * It seems to me it must’. 
be done by the State or not be done at all. The pay of teachers is not generally high enough yet to-. 
warrant much outlay of time and capital by the teachers themselves in their preparations, and they 
must be encouraged to do it by having a portion of the expense paid for them. Schools for teachers 
started without public aid have failed, I believe, in every instance. At any rate, they have degen- 
erated into mere academies, in which the pupils have, as elsewhere, been allowed to choose their 
own studies, and, of course, to choose to neglect the elementary branches most necessary for them te 
learn. (Ib.)

and commodious building was erected after a plan prepared by the trustees. Sun- 
dry citizens of New Jersey sent a petition to the legislature in 1861 praying for the 
repeal of the act establishing the State Normal School, and asking for the appoint- 
ment of a joint committee to investigate certain matters therein referred to. The 
committee on education reported that they did not ‘perceive either the necessity or 
the expediency of a committee of investigation, because all the facts called for were 
fully set forth in public documents to which all have ready access.’? The petitioners 
submitted that ‘‘at times like the present no unnecessary burden should be laid upon 
the people.’”? The committee replied that ‘‘the great lesson taught at times like 
these [the beginning of the war] is that we should relax no effort, omit no expendi- 
ture, and cripple no resource necessary to the instruction and enlightenment of the 
masses of the people. The whole fabric of our Government reposes upon the foun- 
dation of virtue and intelligence universally diffused among the people; but such a 
foundation is possible only through good common schools everywhere established, 
liberally supported, and efficiently conducted by able and skillful teachers. Tomake 
good schools, we must first make good teachers. This is precisely the object and aim 
of the normal school, and the committee believes that a thorough investigation of 
the facts will establish beyond controversy that these aims and objects are being 
realized in a most satisfactory degree.” 
The committee concluded with a unanimous expression of their conviction that 
the prayer of the petitioners ought not to be granted. 
There was until lately in some parts of the State a feeling adverse to the continuance 
of the normal school. The opposition was partly caused by entire misapprehension 
of the character and aims of the institution, and partly by an exaggerated estimate of 
the annual cost of supporting it. Nota solitary well-founded objection was raised, 
but the attacks being repeated annually were detrimental to the best interests of the 
institution and to the cause of popular education in the State. 
       
   
OPENING oF THE ScHOOL av TRENTON. 
The State Normal School of New Jersey was opened in the fall of 1855 in a temporary 
building, rented for the purpose. New buildings were erected from time to time as 
they were needed, The last building was completed in 1890. It is so located as to 
connect the old buildings and thus enable the students to pass to all parts of the entire 
institution without going out of doors. It contains a chemical laboratory, a physical 
laboratory, a manual training shop, a library, a gymnasium, and an auditorium which 
seats about 600 persons. 
On the opening day, in October, 1855, there were 15 pupils in attendance. At the 
close of the half year, 43. The attendance varied considerably from year to year. 
After rising to 140 in 1863, it fell to 53 in 1866. Of late it has been steadily on the 
increase; the last catalogue contains the names of 326 students enrolled in the normal 
school; 541 in the model school, and 127 in the Farnum Preparatory School. The 
number of students graduated from the normal during the year was 89—7 men and 
82 women. Twenty-four of the graduates were from the advanced course; the 
remainder from the elementary course. All of them, except 4, were teaching ‘“‘ when 
last heard from,” at salaries ranging from $35 to $80 a month. 
The Farnum Preparatory School is located in the city of Beverly on the Delaware © 
River, about 15 miles from Philadelphia. It was built by Paul Farnum in the year 
of 1855, and by an act of the legislature in 1857 it was made a part of the State school 
system, and placed under the control of the trustees of the State Normal School. 
An endowment of $20,000 was bequeathed to the school by Mr. Farnum. The objects 
of the school are twofold: First, to act in conjunction with the normal school in the 
work of preparing teachers for the public schools of the State; secondly, to furnish 
to the citizens of Beverly and the vicinity a well-organized and well-conducted 
school, and the best advantages for the proper education of their children. Pupils,

intending to teach are admitted into the four highest classes free of tuition charges. 
These pupils receive daily lessons in teaching, and are required to assist the instructors 
in the work of the school. After passing through the preparatory department, they 
are admitted to the professional course of the normal school without examination. 
The income of the school is derived from three sources—the State appropriation of 
$1,200 annually, the interest on the endowment of $20,000, and the proceeds of 
tuition fees, which average about $20 a year per capita.

COURSE OF STUDY AT TRENTON SCHOOL. 
The course of study for the normal extends through three years of two terms each. 
The work of the first year is formative in character, designed for such students as 
have been over it, but not in the thorough and disciplinary manner necessary to 
those who are to be teachers. While the work of this year can not be said to be 
strictly professional, it is made necessary by the conditions of our State, and, being 
taught by the regular normal teachers, it becomes in a peculiar way preparatory to 
the strictly professional work of the years to follow. 
The work of the second and third years is strictly professional. While arithmetic, 
grammar, geography, United States history, etc., are again taken up in these years, 
they are considered fundamentally in the light of method or how to teach. 
The professional subjects—psychology, theory and practice, the history and phi- 
losophy of education—are pursued, accompanied by practice teaching, extending over 
two years. 
The practice teaching is so arranged that experience in teaching is given to each 
student in each of the common branches. This experience consists in observing the 
regular teacher, preparing plans for teaching, subject to the approval of the critic 
teacher, and actually teaching, both in the presence and absence of the regular teacher. 
The following are the studies of the respective years. In each branch there are 
five forty-minute recitations per week, or the equivalent: 
B.—Geography, physical and political; grammar, with composition; practical arith- 
metic; United States history, with Constitution; penmanship and bookkeeping; indus- 
trial drawing and vocal music, each the equivalent of one term; elocution, with 
orthography and declamation. 
A.—Psychology, theory and practice, one term; methods in the elementary 
branches; practice, one term; zoology and physiology, one term; botany, one term; 
algebra, drawing, rhetoric, one term. 
Senior.—Elementary physics; elementary chemistry, with mineralogy; geometry, 
first five books; Shakespeare, one term; outline history, one term; history and phi- 
losophy of education; practice teaching, two periodsa day; manual training; physical 
training, throughout the course.' 
    
MARYLAND. 
The history of the State Normal School of Maryland is the history of the public 
schools of Maryland. Upto the year 1865 there was no general system of public 
schools, except in the city of Baltimore. There were schools in every county, some 
good, some bad, most of them indifferent; but there was no coordination, no super- 
vision, and very little vitality. In 1864, when the star of the Confederacy was about 
to set, a constitutional convention was called, in which a*large majority of the mem- 
bers were supporters of the Union. The two most important objects of this conven- 
tion were the extinction of slavery and the establishment of a State system of 
education. Both were accomplished. The new constitution contained the following 
sections:

  2340 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
Srcrion 1. The governor shall, within thirty days after the ratification by the peo- 
ple of this constitution, appoint, subject to confirmation of the senate at its first session 
thereafter, a State superintendent of public instruction. * * * Heshall report to 
the general assembly within thirty days after the commencement of its first session 
under this constitution a uniform system of free public schools. * * * 
Sec. 3. * * * In case of failure on the part of the general assembly to provide 
[a public school system as required by the constitution], the system reported to it by 
the State superintendent of public instruction shall become the system of free public 
schools of the State: Provided, That the report of the State superintendent shall be 
in conformity with the provisions of this constitution, and such system shall be sub- 
ject to such alterations, conformable to this article, as the general assembly shall 
from time to time enact. 
The chairman of the committee of education in the constitutional convention was 
Joseph M. Cushing, esq., of Baltimore. He foresaw the possibility that the legisla- 
ture might not carry into effect promptly the constitutional requirements respecting 
education, and therefore persuaded the convention to order that the State superin- 
tendent (who had not yet been appointed) should prepare a bill and submit it to the 
next legislature, with the provision that if the legislature failed to enact a law as 
required by the constitution the ‘bill should become law. It was already well 
understood that Dr. Van Bokkelen would be appointed State superintendent. To 
these two gentlemen belongs the chief credit for the establishment of the public 
school system of Maryland. They deserve to rank with the educational pioneers of 
Massachusetts, New York, and Pennsylvania. 
The bill submitted to the general assembly by Dr. Van Bokkelen was ‘‘harmoni- 
ous in its parts and comprehensive in its aims—a plan not of common schools, but of 
thorough and extended public education.”” It embraced eight titles: (1) supervision; 
(2) that which is to be supervised; (3) modes of securing competent teachers; (4) 
sources of income; (5) university of Maryland; (6) benevolent, remedial, and reforma- 
tory institutions; (7) aids and encouragements to universal education; (8) miscel- 
Janeous. 
In the law finally enacted upon the basis furnished by the State superintendent 
~ the subjects embraced in the fifth, sixth, and seventh sections were omitted, and in 
the others his suggestions were followed without material variation. 
In his first report, explaining the principles on which the bill was founded, Dr. 
Van Bokkelen says:* 
The enactments of the bill submitted are predicated upon principles which have 
been often discussed and now are accepted as the foundation of all sound legislation 
on the subjects with which they are connected. 
First. Education ought to be universal. 
Second. Education ought to be free. 
Third. The property of the whole State is responsible for such education of every 
child in the State as will prepare him to perform the duties of a man and a citizen, 
in obedience to the laws of God and the laws of the Commonwealth. * * * 
Education must be free, free as the light and the air. The public schoolhouse must 
be open to every child, as open as the public highway which leads to its door... And 
this, not because it is the charitable duty of the State to offer education to all, but 
because it would be a high crime against humanity to withhold it. The free schools 
of the State are in no sense charity schools. Through them the State does not give 
one jot or tittle that each child has not a right to claim. It is the duty of the State, 
as the agent of the people, as the legal trustee of the whole property which she pro- 
tects and enables to be used, to take care that the young are not defrauded of their 
rights. * * * Hence, asanatural sequence, the law which provides at public cost 
universal and free education should oblige parents to send their children to school 
and should inflict severe pefialties on manufacturers who task young children in their 
mills, wearing out their bodies and starving their minds. * * * To correct, per- 
chance atone, for the errors of the past, it is proposed to establish at once a thorough 
system, perhaps a model system. Maryland has no time for gradual development.

By one volition she can attain that which has cost her sister States years of experi- 
ment to secure. She has taken her place among the Commonwealths that proclaim 
universal freedom; why not rank also with those that provide universal education? 
Not the education which halts before the door of the primary school, but marches 
on, takes the poorest youth whom God has endowed with intellect, nurtures that 
intellect, gives it the benefit of the best culture and exhibits the pure benevolence of 
republicanism, which, by bestowing equal privileges upon all, gradually raises the 
humble to an equality with those who enjoy all the benefits of wealth and social 
position. Wisdom counsels us not to wait for years to accomplish that which by one 
earnest, vigorous, unselfish effort can be done in months. The work is before us. 
No partial system of gradual development, waiting for the decay of old prejudices or 
the abandonment of local preferences, can do this. If done at all, it will be by a 
system, perfect in its adaptations, comprehensive in its aims, and immediate in its 
operations. It will cost money; so do all great public works; but it will be the best 
and most productive investment the State has ever made—the purse appropriated to 
the development of brain. 
The bill of Dr. Van Bokkelen was not accepted in its entirety, but it became the 
basis of a system which, with many alterations in nonessentials, has lasted to the 
present day, has served as a model to other States, and was pronounced by the late 
governor of the State in his farewell message to be ‘‘nearly perfect.’ 
The law as finally enacted provided for a State board of education, a State super- 
intendent, county superintendents, district schools, graded schools, high schools, 
State uniformity of school books, a normal school and a model teachers’ association, 
teachers’ institutes, and an income from State taxation capable of supporting the 
schools six months in the year, with unlimited power of local taxation. 
The first section of the chapter on the normal school reads thus: ‘‘There shall be 
located in the city of Baltimore, until the board of education shall otherwise direct, 
a State normal school for the instruction and practice of teachers of public schools 
in the science of education and the art of teaching and the mode of governing 
schools. The sessions of the State normal school shall be held in such suitable build- 
ing as may be provided by the mayor and city council of Baltimore, or, they declin- 
ing to do go, in such building as the State superintendent may select.’’ 
The mayor and city council of Baltimore ‘‘declined todoso.’’? With a boys’ high 
school and two girls’ high schools, which they considered quite equal if not superior 
to a normal school, they did not feel under any obligation to enter into partnership 
with the school authorities of the State. Besides, at this time the relations of the 
State superintendent and the city superintendent were somewhat strained. There 
fore search had to be made for a ‘‘suitable building.’? None could be found; but 
after patient waiting a large hall was procured, by no means suitable in any respect, 
but the best that could be obtained. The school was opened on the 15th of January, 
1866, with 11 students. At the close of the session in June there were 48 names on 
the roll. The next year there were 129 students, divided into four classes, each of 
which occupied one of the four corners of the hall. Notwithstanding this disad- 
vantage the numbers continued to increase steadily for six years, when a large and 
commodious building was rented at $3,000 a year, which gave accommodation to 
both the normal and the model school for three years. It soon became evident that 
even this large building would in a short time be too small. Accordingly it was nec- 
essary to apply to the legislature for a new building specially arranged for school 
purposes. Application after application failed to produce any result, but finally, 
by dint of constant hammering, an appropriation of $100,000 was granted to pur- 
chase a site and erect a building. The school took possession of the new building in 
1876. It isa very beautiful structure and contains a hall capable of seating nearly 
800 persons, ten class rooms, a library, a reception room, an office, a laboratory (phys- 
ical and chemical), an apparatus room, a calisthenium, and a residence for the prin- 
cipal. But even this house is now insufficient for the demands of the school. It 
needs a larger library and reading room, a gymnasium, a lecture room, a drawing 
room, a manual training workshop, a larger chemical laboratory, a sewing room, a
-P-A-G-E-1102
  
2342 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
kitchen for lessons in cookery, and additional cloak and toilet rooms. Numbers are 
no test of the professional value of a school, although they may afford a fair estimate 
of its popularity. One may travesty the words of Pope— 
But most by numbers, judge the poet’s song— 
and apply them to schools, normal and abnormal. A school that gives what its 
clientele demands, and at a satisfactory cost, is sure to grow in numbers, at least if 
it has been properly located. The Maryland school has never courted numbers. 
From 18— to 1890 one principal object was to retard its numerical growth. The 
organic law restricted the number of professional students pledged to teach in the 
public schools of Maryland to 200, with the permission to receive as many pay 
students as amounted to half the number of those enrolled and pledged to teach in 
the public schools. But as the free appointments were divided among the several 
counties in proportion to the number of representatives each county had in the 
general assembly, there arose a difficulty in the distribution. At first this arrange- 
ment allowed two students for each member of the legislature, but as the population 
increased the number of representatives increased, and the per capita became one 
and a fraction. Now there is no known method of teaching a fraction of a student 
or even of obtaining a fractional student to be taught, and so the multiplier 2 was 
necessarily continued, and under the present law must continue for many years. 
As has already been stated, the law allows the admission, on the payment of fees, 
of one student, free of obligations to teach in the public schools, for every two who 
have signed the declaration of their intention thus to teach. The purpose was to 
preserve the professional character of the school as a training school for teachers. 
Accordingly no special instruction is given to unprofessional students; they simply 
have the privilege of joining such regular classes as they may be inclined and quali- 
fied to enter. There is but one curriculum for all. In striking contrast with the 
number of ‘‘courses’’ advertised in many normal-school catalogues—elementary, 
advanced, scientific, classical, commercial, collegiate, ete.—the primary object of 
the school is simply the training of young persons as teachers of the common district 
schools in esse and in posse. The effect of constant adherence to this principle has 
been that about 95 per cent of the graduates and 50 per cent of the undergraduates 
and a majority of the unpledged students who completed the course have become 
teachers of the public schools—a small proportion of them in city schools, but by 
far the largest number in rural districts. 
A model school was provided for in the organic law: ‘‘The State board of educa- 
tion shall make provision for model and experimental primary and grammar schools, 
under qualified teachers, in which students of the normal school shall have an 
opportunity to practice the modes of instruction and discipline inculcated in the 
normal school.’’ The model school is still an experiment, not an achievement. It 
was commenced in the first year as a school of obseryation and practice, the practice 
largely predominating. It was.necessarily a pay school. Had it been a free school 
it would have come into undesirable competition with the public schools of the city. 
As a pay school, some parents complained, without just reason, that their children 
were made subjects of experiment. The fact is that the children were better taught 
than they had been before or have been since. But vox populi prevailed because 
the fees were a welcome addition to the restricted income derived from the State. 
The school then became a school of observation with a seasoning of practice. At 
present it affords a minimum both of observation and practice, owing to peculiar 
circumstances, which throw no light on the general question of the place of the 
model school in an institution for the training of teachers. The subject presents no 
difficulties in a city training school nor in small towns where there is a unity of 
purpose between the local school authorities and the superintendent of the normal 
school. But a State normal school, located in a large city, organized for the special

purpose of preparing teachers for the district country schools, will have a hard road 
to travel to establish a school of observation and practice which shall meet both the 
theoretical and practical requirements of the case. 
The scholastic attainments required by law for admission into the normal school 
are a knowledge of the branches ‘‘ hereinbefore required from -teachers.”” In other 
words, an applicant for admission must be already legally qualified to teach school. 
The theory is correct, but in practice not one in ten would apply for admission. 
The aim of nine-tenths is to be legally qualified, not better qualified. A strict 
adherence to the law would have had the effect to prepare a very few teachers for 
higher—or, rather, for more remunerative—positions than country schools, and thus 
the main intent of the law would have been frustrated. The appointment of free 
students was vested in the boards of county school commissioners, and they, taking 
a practical and not a legal view of the case, sent up large numbers of students who 
needed academic rather than professional instruction, and the normal-school author- 
ities had no right, and indeed no desire, to refuse them admission. 
This large infusion of academic instruction was not without its advantages. The 
young graduate, when thrown upon his own resources as a teacher of a country 
school, found more help and inspiration in the recollection of the practices and 
methods of his normal teachers than in the psychological principles and pedagogical 
precepts with which his notebook was filled. 
COURSE OF INSTRUCTION.! 
The course of instruction extends through three years. Graduates of high schools 
and certificated teachers may enter the second year’s class without examination, and 
the third year’s class on passing an examination on the studies of the second year. 
First year, first term.—Review of arithmetic, mental and written; geometry, first 
book; object lessons; history and geography; English composition, letter writing; 
pedagogy, lectures on methods in elementary schools; Latin grammar (optional). 
First year, second term.—Algebra, through simple equations; English grammar, 
pautng and analysis; English composition; physiology; Latin reader (optional); 
lectures on teaching, organization and government of elementary schools. 
Second year, first term.—Geometry (plane), continued; geography and map draw- 
ing; algebra, completed; botany and natural history; pedagogy, lectures on prin- 
ciples; Latin (optional), Virgil. 
Second year, second term.—Arithmetic, completed; parsing and analysis; elocution; 
English literature; pedagogy, lectures on principles and methods; chemistry, labo- 
ratory work; cooking. 
Third year, first term.—Physics; physical geography; botany (field work); English 
literature; geometry, completed; Latin (optional), Cicero. 
Third year, second term.—General review of elementary studies, with reference to 
practical teaching; trigonometry and practical surveying (formen); bookkeeping by 
double entry; teaching exercises; pedagogy, history of education; psychology, logic. 
Singing, drawing, and calisthenics are taught in every term except the last; also 
sewing (to women) and military tactics and thesuse of woodworking tools (to men). 
Students will be examined on entrance in order to ascertain the proper class to 
which they should be assigned. Admission to the lowest class will require that the 
candidate should be able to read fluently, spell correctly, write legibly and rapidly, 
and perform accurately easy computations in whole numbers and in vulgar and deci- 
mal fractions. Young persons who have not received a good primary education 
should not expect to obtain it at this school, under the claim that they are training 
for teachers; but all due allowance will be made for earnest and diligent students 
who will exert themselves to obtain a good standing during the first term of proba- 
tion. Nostudent will be allowed to enter an advanced class until all the work required 
in the lower classes has been performed satisfactorily. 
Students differ very greatly, both in natural ability and acquired preparation. It 
is not expected that all shall make equal advancement in equal times. To fail to 
pass an examination is of itself no disgrace. The disgrace lies in the want of due 
diligence; or, still more, in the desire to seem to be that which one is not.

NORMAL SCHOOLS IN THE SOUTH ATLANTIC STATES. 
VIRGINIA. 
Srate FremaLe Norma Scuoon, FARMVILLE. 
On the 31st of March, 1879, the senate of Virginia passed the following resolution: 
Whereas the State of Virginia, during almost the entire period of her history, has 
liberally provided for the higher education of her sons, and is now supporting three 
superior institutions for such purpose; and 
Whereas the Commonwealth has never, at any period of her history, made any 
provision whatever for the education of her daughters; Therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the superintendent of public instruction be, and he is hereby, 
requested to gather and in his next annual report furnish to this body such informa- 
tion and views in regard to higher female education as might be useful in considering 
the propriety and practicability of making by this State some provision in this 
direction; and that he inquire and report the cost of education in such female semi- 
naries of other States as are assisted or supported at public expense with any matter 
of interest concerning the same.! 
The resolution says not a word about normal schools—wisely, perhaps; higher 
education was more popular with Virginia, legislators than normal education. But 
the State superintendent in his response to the order of the legislature included 
normal schools among the agencies of higher education, while he pressed upon the 
community ‘‘the unjust discrimination that had been made in favor of the sons and 
against the daughters of Virginia.”’ Five years elapsed—years of financial embar- 
rassment and years of needed enlightenment of the public mind under the tuition of 
that eminent public educator, Dr. W. H. Ruffner, State superintendent—and when 
the legislature of Virginia took up the question of the higher education of women in 
1884 it was prepared to give a favorable answer. 
The normal schools of the South, with the exception of South Carolina, were post 
bellum and, toa great extent, propter bellum. Being the necessary complement of 
a system of free schools, without such a system normal schools had no raison d’étre. 
It is a curious coincidence that every argument that has been brought against the 
establishment of normal schools had previously been urged against the maintenance 
of free public schools. We may expect to find the development of a State system of 
public schools to be accompanied or followed by the establishment of normal

schools. The efficiency of either may always be measured by the progress of the 
other. 
The State Female Normal School of Virginia is the successor and, to a certain 
extent, the outgrowth of the Farmville Female College, an institution which had 
been in successful operation for many years previous to the transformation. The 
legislature enacted in 1884 that there should be established a normal school expressly 
for the training and education of white female teachers for public schools. Each 
city of 5,000 inhabitants and each county of the 100 counties in the State was 
to be entitled to send one pupil free of cost for tuition; also one free pupil for each 
additional representative in the house of delegates above one. The law appropriated 
$5,000 for preliminary expenses and $10,000 a year for current expenditure, the 
amount to be paid out of the public free-school fund. This last clause produced 
some embarrassment and delay. The second auditor refused to honor the draft of 
the school board for $10,000 because the attorney-general had given his opinion that 
it was not legally chargeable to the public-school fund, but to the general treasury, 
and the auditor declined to pay the amount out of any other fund than the one 
specified in the act. So the question was carried to the court of appeals, which 
decided that the amount could not be paid out of either. But the legislature at its 
first session thereafter cut the Gordian knot and the money was paid. 
The first principal of the school was Dr. William H. Ruffner, who had been for 
twelve years previously State superintendent of public instruction. In an address 
delivered by him in 1885, before the county superintendents of Virginia, he explained 
the modes of teaching employed by the instructors: 
In normal schools generally the oral method of instruction is employed more 
fully than is usually practicable in other schools. On most subjects there is no text- 
book used in the way text-books are commonly employed—that is, there is no uni- 
form set of books in which lessons are assigned to be conned and recited. Books 
are used only for reference, and any book containing the facts or expositions wanted 
may be resorted to. In teaching the elementary principles of any study, no use 
whatever is made of a book. 
The principle sought is developed as far as possible by a system of questions 
addressed orally to the students in class, which will often bring together truths 
already known in such a way as to reveal their fundamental relations and suggest 
the desired principle. Examples and perhaps concrete illustrations may also be 
employed as guides. The teacher must, of course, make affirmative statements, but 
these are made only when the principle or the fact can not be reached through the 
previously existing knowledge or the understanding of the student. When, by the 
combined efforts of teacher and students, the desired statement is put in due form, it 
is written on the blackboard and copied into the note books and subsequently recited 
upon. After a time topics are assigned, which the students are required to prepare 
themselves to expound, and they are expected to resort not to particularly specified 
books, but to any books they can find which will afford them the help they need. 
A reference room, furnished with suitable books, is provided for this purpose. 
A still more specialized feature in the course is the teaching exercise, given daily 
by the students as a part of each lesson. The students repeat the teacher’s work 
according to their several ability. Usually the student is notified in advance that she 
will be called upon to teach a given topic at the proper time, and she is expected to 
develop the subject by a carefully prepared system of questions and statements, 
exactly as if she were instructing a class in her own school. At the end of each 
exercise the members of the class are allowed to make criticisms, and the teacher 
also corrects any error as to matter or manner. 
Dr. Ruffner’s successor, Prof. John A. Cunningham, found that these teaching 
exercises occupied too large a part of the time of the class, and were in his opinion a 
serious obstacle to progress in the study of subject-matter. As the majority of stu- 
dents were pursuing many of their studies for the first time, it was thought impossi- 
ble for them to assume the point of view of the teacher in a subject of which they 
had obtained an incomplete view. Besides, the necessity for such exercises had been 
lessened by increased amount of work in the practice school. Accordingly the
-P-A-G-E-1106

course of study was divided so as to give two years for academic training and one of 
strictly professional work. The courses of study, as now (1891) planned, are— 
First year, two terms.—Language, including syntax, composition, and thorough sen- 
tence analysis; algebra and geometry; physiology, one term; physical geography, 
one term; general history, drawing, vocal music, elocution, Latin (elective). 
Second year, two terms.—History of the English language, rhetoric, and literature; 
geometry, one term; a teachers’ review of arithmetic, one term; chemistry, one term; 
civics, one term; drawing, vocal music, Latin (elective). 
Third year, professional course.—Psychology; history and science of education; 
school management; methods in arithmetic, grammar, geography, and reading; 
school laws of Virginia; observation and practice in the model school. 
Graduates from known high schools are admitted to the professional course and 
after one year’s successful study under the direction of the faculty are given a 
diploma. 
The annual appropriation from the State is $10,000. 
The number of students for the year ending 1890 was 143, of whom 14 were in 
the professional course and 8 in special courses, 
      WEST VIRGINIA. 
MarsHati Contecr, Huntixeton. 
The State normal school of West Virginia was established by act of the legislature 
February, 1867, which provided ‘‘That there be established a State normal school, 
to be called the ‘West Virginia State Normal School,’ for the instruction and prac- 
tice of teachers of common schools in the science of education and the art of teaching.”” 
Marshall College, near the young and growing city of Huntington, having already 
acquired considerable reputation as an educational institution, was made the State 
normal school, and the property of the college was transferred to the State. Subse- 
quently five branches of the State normal school were established by law, making 
six normal schools in the State.2. The supreme direction is in the board of regents, 
composed of the superintendent of free schools, ex officio, and one member 
appointed by the governor from each of the four Congressional districts of the State. 
The board of regents has provided for two distinct courses of study in the State nor- 
mal school and its branches—a normal training course and an academic course. The 
former occupies three years; the latter two years. The junior year in the normal 
department embraces orthography, reading, writing, arithmetic, geography, English 
grammar and language lessons, United States history, elementary algebra, civil gov- 
ernment, physiology, drawing, exercises in composition and declamation. The 
middle year embraces orthography, reading, prose composition, sentence analysis, 
physical geography, algebra to quadratics, elements of general history, theory and 
practice of teaching, elements of pedagogy, the school law of the State, exercises in 
composition and declamation, ancient or modern languages (optional). The senior ~ 
year includes spelling by dictation and written exercises, English literature and. 
rhetoric, algebra (completed), elementary geometry and trigonometry, elements of 
natural philosophy, natural history, botany, bookkeeping by single entry, psy- 
chology, history of education, frequent exercises in hearing classes recite, the organ- 
ization and classification of schools. 
The practical working of the regents’ scheme will be better understood from the 
following programme, taken from the Catalogue of the State Normal School at Fair- 
mont for the year 1890:

      The academic course is understood to be equivalent to a preparatory college course, 
and is accepted as such by the State university. 
Tuition is free to all regular normal students. The number of free appointments 
is regulated by the board of regents and distributed among the several counties of 
the State according to population. Each normal school is entitled to seventy free

The State normal school at Fairmont was opened in 1868. A bill proposing the 
establishment of such a school at this place was introduced into the legislature in 
the session of 1865-66, but failed to pass. Not discouraged by the failure, the citizens 
formed a joint stock company under the title of ‘‘The Regency of the West Virginia 
Normal School,” secured a charter, purchased a lot, and commenced building, but 
before the house was completed the normal school passed under the control of the 
State. In 1872 a new and much larger building was erected, 80 by 40 feet and three 
stories high. The cost was about $20,000, of which one-half came from the State 
treasury and the other from the citizens of Fairmont and Marion County. 
The course of study at Fairmont, though conforming to the requirements of the 
regents’ course, is elastic and very accommodating: 
Can pupils be accommodated in any course they may desire to pursue? Most 
certainly they can; and if classes are not formed ready for them to enter, such classes 
will be organized for their advantage. The plan of the school is to meet the demand 
ofits patrons. * * * 
To what extent can pupils pursue branches of learning? To this inquiry our reply 
is: To the same extent they can in any other institution. In this school there are 
both normal and collegiate departments. * “3 
1s it better to remain out of school and teach a year, or to teach a term of four or 
three months each year and try at the same time to keep up with the classes in the 
normal school? We have no hesitation in saying it is best in every respect for 
the student, whether lady or gentleman, to teach but three or four months in the 
year and to hold his position in the classes of the normal school at the same time. 
This a young man of energy and good health and application can do by an extra 
effort. * * * The only plan to secure success on the part of young persons in 
aining an education by their own effortsis to join the normal school at once, become 
identified with its work, and then avail themselves of the provisions of its regula- 
tions, which allow students to teach four months during the year.!

During the spring of 1871 Mr. Shepherd Brooks was asked to give the buildings 
erected by his grandfather, and which had been used as a court-house for some years, 
for the purpose of opening therein a classical and scientific school, and the request 
was readily granted. A board of trustees was incorporated, a charter obtained, and 
the school opened in September. In the following February the legislature author- 
ized the organization of a branch State normal school at Shepherd College; but owing 
to legislative changes the school did not get fully into operation until September, 
1873. 
In addition to the normal and academic departments common to all the normal 
schools of West Virginia, Shepherd College has, according to the catalogue, a collegiate 
department, and an ‘‘ ornamental department,” which includes a course in vocal and 
instrumental music, a course in French, a course in botany, a course in drawing, and 
a course in art embroidery. The music course requires four years for its completion 
and the French course three years. The last catalogue has the names of twenty-three 
students in the “‘ ornamental department.’’ 
Shepherdstown is a very interesting place. It is the oldest town in West Virginia. 
The college bears the name of one of the original settlers, Thomas Shepherd, who 
Jed a colony of emigrants from Pennsylvania in 1734. The battlefield of Antietam 
is but 3 miles distant. South Mountain is in sight, and farther east is Harper’s 
Ferry. One of the cliffs, just outside the corporation, is known as Rumsey’s Walk. 
Pacing its heights, an inventive genius, James Rumsey, conceived the plan of the

The State Normal School at Glenville was established by an act of the legislature 
passed in February, 1872, and was opened in pursuance thereof in January, 1873. In 
1885 there was a State appropriation of $5,000 made for a new building, and in 1887 
$2,000 additional were granted for the purchase of furniture and apparatus. As in 
the other normal schools of the State, there are two courses, the normal and the 
academic, arranged on the lines prescribed by the board of regents; but ‘‘any studies 
desired may be pursued in addition to those in the normal curriculum, and every 
pupil is always furnished with all the studies he can successfully pursue.’’ Boarding, 
with room, fuel, and light, can be had at from $2 to $2.50 per week. ‘‘ Boarding is 
lower priced here than at any other school of high grade in the State.” Term reports, 
containing the number of days absent, the number of times tardy, and the average 
grade in each branch studied, and the results of examination in each branch, made 
up from the records of the school, are transmitted through the pupils to the parents 
or guardians of every pupil. There isa small but very useful library of reference 
books, and a cabinet of philosophical apparatus complete enough for the illustration 
of ordinary text-books on natural philosophy’. 
The students registered (1889-90) numbered 96; 19 seniors, 23 middle class, and 
54 juniors. The faculty consists of the principal, two regular assistants and two assist- 
ing students. 
NORTH CAROLINA. 
Srare Norma AnD InpusTRIAL SCHOOL, GREENSBORO. 
The constitution of 1776 contained the following (Article XLI): 
A school or schools shall be established by the legislature for the convenient 
instruction of youth, with such salaries to the masters, paid by the public, as may 
enable them to instruct at low prices; and all useful learning shall be duly encouraged 
and promoted in one or-more universities. 
The constitution of 1868, Article IX, section 16, declares that— 
The general assembly shall establish and maintain, in connection with the univer- 
sity, a department of agriculture, of mechanics, of mining, and of normal instruction. 
A considerable amount of normal instruction was given preyious to 1888, in con- 
nection with the University of North Carolina, by means of teachers’ institutes, sum- 
mer normal schools, and a normal course of three months in the university; and in 
1888 a chair of pedagogy was established. But as the university is open to men 
only, this step increased the urgency of the demand for a school for women. It was 
said, as had been said in Virginia some years previously, that it took the State more 
than a century to learn that ‘‘youth’”’ means girls as well as boys; that from three- 
fourths to nine-tenths of the money used to employ instructors in higher education 
for boys is paid by State and national appropriations, or by the income from endow- 
ment funds; and that if the State proposed to pay for nearly all a boy’s higher 
education, it ought to do at least as much for his sister. The justice of these views 
was clearly, forcibly, persistently, and one might almost say authoritatively, urged 
by the teachers of the State. The fourth annual session of the North Carolina 
Teachers’ Assembly was held at Morehead City in June, 1887. It was one of the 
largest and most intelligent assemblages of teachers of one State ever seen in the

South. The chief topic discussed was the need of a State normal college for both 
sexes. The committee appointed at a previous meeting (1886) to memorialize the gen- 
eral assembly for the establishment of a normal college was continued, with instruc- 
tions to keep the subject before that body until the college was established. Each 
succeeding teachers’ assembly passed similar resolutions and appointed similar com- 
mittees. One is reminded of the importunate widow whose ‘continual coming’’ 
worried the judge. But though the argument of the committee was reenforced by 
the governor and the State superintendent, it was not until 1889 that the subject was 
seriously taken up by the general assembly. At that session the legislature was 
“almost persuaded,’’ the bill presented by the committee of the general assembly 
having passed the Senate, and failed in the House by but a few votes. At the next 
session, 1891, with the aid of the King’s Daughters, Dr. J. L. M. Curry, and the 
North Carolina Farmers’ Alliance, the assault was renewed and the fort surrendered. 
The act establishing the institution required that it should be located ‘‘at some 
suitable place where the citizens thereof will furnish the necessary buildings or money 
sufficient to erect them.’’? The town of Greensboro offered $30,000 cash and a 10-acre 
lot within the corporate limits—the last being a donation from two public-spirited 
citizens of Raleigh. 
The buildings are beautiful without and comfortable within, and were expected to 
be ready for occupancy on the 28th of September, the day named for the opening of the 
school. The faculty consists of the president, Charles D. McIver, professor of (1) prin- 
ciples and history of education and the science and art of teaching, and professors in 
the following chairs: (2) history and English literature; (3) mathematics and Ger- 
man; (4) natural sciences; (5) physiology and hygiene, physical culture; (6) Latin 
and French; (7) vocal m and elocution; (8) industrial art; (9) domestic science. 
It is intended that the school should embrace three departments: (1) The normal 
department; (2) the business department; (8) the domestic science department. 
The object of the normal department is not only to give the very best literary and 
scientific training, butalso to give such a course in the principles and history of educa- 
tion and in the science and art of teaching as will give the student the ability and 
the inclination to teach others. 
The business or commercial course embraces stenography, typewriting, telegraphy, 
and bookkeeping, and is intended for women who wish to make their own living 
but have no desire to become teachers. 
The domestic science department recognizes the fact that the natural and proper 
position in life for the average woman is at the head of her own household. It 
includes theory and practice in sewing, cutting and fitting, cooking, care of the sick, 
and general household economy. 
To complete the full course of instruction will require four years of work, and 
graduates will receive a diploma equivalent to a life certificate to teach in the public 
schools of North Carolina.     
  SOUTH CAROLINA. 
The winged seeds of the ‘‘normal idea’’ had been wafted as far south as Charles- 
ton before the war; but what good seed could flourish amid the flames of civil strife? 
The people of South Caroiina had a State normal school, not in idea merely, but in 
actual existence, in 1860. It was called the ‘‘Girls’ High and Normal School;’’ but 
as each Congressional district was authorized to send fifteen students to the normal 
department, it was de facto a State normal school. 
The commissioners of free schools, C. 8. Memminger, chairman, in explaining the 
purposes of the school, say: ‘‘It is proposed to form into a special class all those 
[young women] whose purpose is to devote themselv@s to this honorable work [teach-

ing], and whose qualifications admit of their receiving the proper course of instruc- 
tion. * * * The power of teaching well comes not by intuition. * * * It 
comes as other arts come, by special training.’’! 
Of course the school expired amid the flames. 
In 1874 a State normal school was opened at Columbia, and after a short career, 
full of promise, was closed by the withdrawal of the State appropriation. 
‘Wixtirop ScHoor. 
In the summer of 1886, Prof. D. B. Johnson, superintendent of the graded schools 
of Columbia, went north on a professional visit to several normal schools, and, in an 
interview with the trustees of the Peabody fund, was assured of an annual appro- 
priation of $1,500 for the purpose of establishing, in Columbia, a training school for 
the teachers of South Carolina. In December, 1886, an act of the legislature was 
passed entitled, “An act relating to the Winthrop Training School for Teachers.” 
The preamble and first section read thus: ,. 
“ Be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the State of South Carolina, 
now met and sitting in general assembly, and by the authority of the same: 
“‘Sgcrion 1. That there is hereby founded and established, at Columbia, S. C., 
‘The Winthrop Training School for Teachers; that the particular aim and object of 
said school shall be to educate and train persons desirous of following the profession 
of teaching.’” 
Section 2 constitutes the board of school commissioners of the city of Columbia 
ex officio ‘Trustees of the Winthrop Training School for Teachers,’’ and confers 
upon them the most ample powers for the execution of the trust. 
Section 3 provides that the functions and duties of the trustees of the Winthrop 
Training School for Teachers shall be separate and distinct from those of the school 
commissioners of the school district of the city of Columbia. 
Section 4 authorizes and empowers the trustees to receive donations and bequests, 
and to hold real'and personal property to the amount of $100,000 for the use and 
benefit of the school. 
Section 5. ‘‘The said trustees are authorized and empowered to grant diplomas to 
all persons who satisfactorily complete the prescribed course of study and training in 
said school; and persons holding such diplomas will be entitled, without further 
examination, to teach in any of the public schools of the State as first-grade teachers.”’ 
The school was named in honor of Robert C. Winthrop, the venerable chairman 
of the trustees of the Peabody fund. 
The school is not altogether a free school; there is a fee for tuition of $2 a month, 
or $5 a term for each of the three terms of twelve weeks, if paid in advance at the 
beginning of the term. One young lady from each county is received free of tuition 
charges on the recommendation of the county board of examiners. The State of 
South Carolina makes annual appropriation for 34 scholarships, of the value of $150 
each, a scholarship to be given to one student from each county of the State; $30 of 
this sum is given to the school for tuition, text-books, etc., and the remaining $120 
is given to the student in installments of $40 each at the ieee of each term, to 
assist her in defraying her personal expenses of traveling, board, ete. This money 
is paid out to the students only upon the order of the State superintendent of eduea- 
tion. The beneficiaries of the scholarships are selected by competitive written 
examinations in the different counties: In addition to the State scholarships, a 
scholarship for tuition is given by the school to the young lady in each county who 
receives second rank in the county examinations. Neither the State scholarship nor 
the tuition scholarship is given unless the examination proves satisfactory, and no 
scholarship is allowed to any pegson for more than one session. On the completion

of their course beneficiary students are required by law ‘‘to teach for one year in the 
common schools of the respective counties from which they were appointed, provided 
positions are offered them as first-grade teachers in such schools.”’ 
COURSE OF STUDY. 
The curriculum (catalogue 1889-90) includes the following studies and the methods 
of teaching them: Reading, spelling, English language, arithmetic, geography, physi- 
ology, history of the United States, lessons on form and color, lessons on plants and 
animals, elements of physics, penmanship, drawing, vocal music and calisthenics, 
psychology, history of education, school organization and management, and practice 
in teaching. 
Applicants for admission are required to be not less than 17 years of age, and 
must express their intention of engaging in the profession of teaching. They must 
also pass a satisfactory entrance examination in reading, spelling, arithmetic, gram- 
mar, geography, history of the United States, and penmanship. 
The school [says the superintendent] is a normal training school in all its courses. 
Its aim is strictly professional, and only those pupils are wanted who are ready to 
undertake the work with a feeling of personal interest in teaching as a profession. 
* * * The design of the school is to prepare for teachers young women who 
already haye a oad education by training them in methods of teaching and school 
management. * * * The normal class work extends through the course, and 
includes logical reviews of all subjects of common-school study from the teacher’s 
standpoint. In each study the subject is analyzed into its divisions and subdivisions, 
arranged topically in logical order. In most of the common-school studies the out- 
line is divided into an elementary course for the primary grades, and a secondary or 
scientific course for the higher grades. * * * The practice teaching is intended 
to be an application of the principles studied in the normal class, so that the whole 
course of training may give, not a servile imitation of methods now in use, but such 
independent, progressive teaching ability as will enable one to adapt herself to the 
needs of any school, whether graded or ungraded, in city or country. 
The practice department of the school contains about 100 children, forming classes 
in the first, second, and third primary grades. These children are taught by the 
pupil-teachers, subject to the constant supervision of two of the teachers of the 
school. Opportunity is also given to the students to observe thoroughly the work 
done in the higher grades of the Columbia graded schools." 
The Hon. James H. Rice, State superintendent of public instruction, says in hig 
report for 1888: 
The legislature established a normal college for males within the South Carolina 
University. * * * The Winthrop Training School for Females was established 
two years ago. * * * Bya happy arrangement with the trustees of the Win- 
throp Training School the students of both institutions have the privilege of attend- 
ing upon the lectures of both colleges. It [the Winthrop Training choot] was 
founded by Superintendent D. B. Johnson with slender means, and seemed as frail a 
bark as the Mayflower of the Pilgrim fathers. To the timid it promised nothing but 
disaster to mariners and crew. Under the skillful and practiced hand of the presi- 
dent it has weathered the storm. * * * This movement is rich in promise alike 
to the State and the young lady students. We secure trained talent for the schools 
and they have the means of making an honorable living. This is the first dollar 
South Carolina has given to educate her daughters, and it has been most worthily 
bestowed. * * * Jt is proper to say that this effort was made possible by the 
liberality of the Peabody trustees, through their accomplished secretary, Dr. 8. A. 
Green. * * * Institutions for normal training are now a part of the ordinary 
educational machinery and need no vindication. * * * It is presumed that the 
State has only begun this work. Modifications may and will be needed in the plan 
of operations and the methods of assistance. She can never retrace her steps.”

GEORGIA. 
Norma anp InpustriAL CoLLEGE For GrorGta GIRLS, MILLEDGEVILLE. 
The original bill for the establishment of this institution was introduced into the 
Georgia legislature in July, 1889, and became a law in the following November. The 
corner stone of the college building was laid in November, 1890, and the college was 
opened on the 30th of September, 1891, with 88 pupils. The year closed with 171 
regular matriculates, including 64 normal students proper, and 92 special students. 
The second session (September, 1892) opened with 272 pupils coming from 94 dif- 
ferent counties in Georgia. The college seems to have sprung, like Pallas from the 
head of Zeus, full grown and fully armed. 
The building and grounds cost $100,000. The annual appropriation from the State 
amounts to $18,000, which is supplemented by a donation from the Peabody fund of 
$1,800. 
The title ‘“Normal and Industrial” indicates the purpose of the college, which is 
to enable girls— 
(1) To do intelligent work as teachers, according to the best modern methods. 
(2) To earn a livelihood by the practice of some of ‘the industrial arts suitable to 
women. 
(3) To exert an uplifting and refining influence on the home circle and on general 
society. 
(4) To acquire skill in those domestic arts that lie at the foundation of successful 
housekeeping. 
The four principal departments, normal, industrial, collegiate, and domestic, do not 
form four distinct and separate schools; they are coordinate parts of one complete 
system, and are so related to one another as to form one harmonious whole. 
The full normal course extends through four years. The professional studies for 
each year are: Freshman, Baldwin’s School Management; Sophomore, Baldwin’s 
Educational Psychology and observation visits to model school; Junior, Compayré’s 
History of Pedagogy and observation visits to model school; Senior, Practice teach- 
ing in Model School. 
The model school was established and is maintained entirely by means of an annual 
donation from the Peabody fund. It serves both as a school of observation and as a 
practice school for students of the senior normal class. It is composed of forty chil- 
dren from 6 to 11 years of age divided into four grades. 
The general, or literary and scientific course for normal students is identical with 
the collegiate course. z 
COLLEGIATE DEPARTMENT. 
Freshman class.—Elementary algebra, Meiklejohn’s English Language, Parts I and 
II; physics, American classics, Roman history, Czesar, prose composition. 
Sophomore class.—Algebra, completed ; English Language, Parts II and III; chem- 
istry, History of England; studies in Scott and Tennyson, Cicero and Virgil. 
Junior class.—Geometry, plane and solid; critical study of Shakespeare’s plays, 
geology and physical geography, ancient and medizyal history, Horace, Livy, Tacitus. 
Senior class.—Trigonometry, arithmetic reviewed, critical study of English classics, 
astronomy, civics and current history, standard current literature, cooking. 
All pupils who take the college course only, without the normal course, are expected 
to devote at least five hours a week to the study of some one of the industrial arts. 
Care has been taken not to overcrowd the curriculum with a multiplicity of studies. 
The plan of instruction has been intensive rather than extensive. Every art and 
science is a microcosm, containing in itself the principle and essence of all other arts 
and sciences; for instance, study chemistry well and you have the principle and 
essence of all science; study Shakespeare well and you have the principle and essence 
of all poetry; study the story of ancient Rome well and you have the principle and

essence of all history. Another reason for making the studies fewer than are usual 
found in college courses is that time may be had for the industrial arts, to whic 
every pupil is required to give a fair share of her attention. 
INDUSTRIAL DEPARTMENT. 
The studies in this department are, (1) stenography and typewriting; (2) teleg- 
raphy; (3) bookkeeping; (4) dressmaking; (5) free-hand and industrial drawing; 
(6) cooking. 
In selecting these from all the available industries, the authorities of the college 
had regard primarily to their business value and secondarily to their culture 
value. * * * Carefully compiled statistics show that the first four arts mentioned 
haye a greater business value for women than any other employments what- 
ever. * * * GOooking, the sixth and last in the list, was selected, of course, almost 
entirely for its domestic or household value. * * * The design of this institution, 
however, is to educate the head as well as the hand, and its firm purpose is to avoid 
turning out mere workwomen, ignorant of everything except the narrow craft b 
which they earn their living. No pupil, therefore, will be allowed to devote herself 
to the industrials to the exclusion of all other studies unless she can demonstrate to 
the president that she has already a fair English education.' 
FLORIDA. 
The legislature of Florida passed an act in 1851 establishing two seminaries of 
learning, ‘‘one upon the east, the other on the west side of Suwanee River; the first 
purpose of which shall be the instruction of persons, both male and female, in the 
art of teaching all the various branches that pertain to a good common-school educa- 
tion; and, next, to give instruction in the mechanic arts, in husbandry and agricul- 
tural chemistry, in the fundamental laws, and in what regards the rights and duties 
of citizens.’’ Four townships of land were granted to the State of Florida by the 
General Government (acts of 1823 and 1845) for the purpose of endowing two such 
seminaries, and the sale of those lands produced a fund for their support. The 
East Florida Seminary was located first at Ocala, Marion County, and was removed to 
Gainesville by an act of the legislature passed in 1866. The normal element, which 
was never strong, soon died out, and the need of it has not been much felt since 
1887, when provision was made for the organization of two State normal schools, one 
for the white teachers and one for the colored. 
In that year the legislature passed an act appropriating $4,000 a year for the sup- 
port of a normal school for white teachers, and locating it at De Funiak Springs, in 
Walton County, on the Pensacola and Atlantic Railroad, about midway between the 
Chattahoochee River and Pensacola. 
The course of study covers two years. Graduates receive a diploma as licentiate 
of instruction, which is equivalent to a first-class life certificate within the State. The 
minimum age of admission is 16 years, and applicants must pass an examination in 
the common-school branches. Before being admitted students must pledge them- 
selves to teach for two years in the State if a suitable opportunity is offered. Such 
students pay no tuition fees if residents of the State; nonresidents pay $5 a quarter 
(ten weeks). The faculty consists of the president, two professors, and oneassistant 
teacher. The last catalogue contains the names of ninety students, young men and 
young women. 
The studies of the normal departments are as follows: 
Junior, first term.—(1) Rhetoric and composition, four hours a week; (2) general 
history, four hours a week; (8) algebra, four hours a week; (4) Latin, four hours a 
week; (5) physiology, two and a half hours a week; (6) drawing, one and a half 
hours a week. 
Junior, second term.—(1) Rhetorie and history, four hours a week; (2) algebra,

laboratory; (2) Latin, four hours a week; (3) spherical trigonometry, surveying, 
navigation, four hours:a week; (4) astronomy, four hours a week; (5) civil govern- 
ment and Florida school law, four hours a week. 
Psychology and pedagogy extend through the two years’ normal course. 
The following are stated as the ‘‘special features’’ of the school: 
“‘(1) Tuition is free; (2) highest board only $10 per calendar month; (3) no 
uniform required; (4) open to both sexes; (5) curriculum covers a period of two 
years; (6) diploma a life certificate in this State; (7) a school for mature persons— 
pupils 28 years of age in attendance; (8) a State institution under the direct super- 
vision of the State board of education.’ !

NORMAL SCHOOLS IN THE NORTH CENTRAL DIVISION. 
OHIO. 
There is no State normal school in Ohio, although it was among the first, if not the 
very first, to recognize by legislative action the need of such an institution and to 
take some preliminary steps for its establishment.. The general assembly in 1836 
requested Prof. Calvin E. Stowe,? who was then about to visit the countries of 
Europe, ‘‘to collect during his contemplated tour such facts and information as he 
might deem useful to the State in relation to the various systems of public instruc- 
tion and education which had been adopted in the countries through which he, might 
pass, and to make a report of the same, with such observations as he might offer, to 
a future general assembly.”” On his return Professor Stowe presented a report 
warmly advocating training schools for teachers as an indispensable factor of any 
State system of common schools, and especially recommending the establishment in 
Ohio of a normal school with model schools and schools of practice. 
Two years later, Samuel Lewis, State superintendent of common schools, presented 
a report to the legislature in which he fayored the establishment of a State uni- 
versity for the education of teachers and others. 
In 1841, William Trevitt, secretary of state, urged the legislature to follow the 
example of Massachusetts in the establishment of normal schools. One of his suc- 
cessors, Mr. Galloway, recommended the planting of one normal school at Columbus. 
In 1851, Henry W. King, secretary of state, advocated the establishment of as many 
normal schools as the school system of Ohio should demand. 
The only result of these earnest and long-continued efforts was the increased popu- 
larity of the cause, especially among teachers, which was evidenced by the upspring- 
ing of a number of independent normal schools, some of which, or their successors, 
are now doing good service. 
In 1866, in response to the request of the general assembly, the Hon. Emerson E. 
White, then State school commissioner, presented a report containing a most lucid, 
elaborate, and convincing argument in favor of normal schools. He had made him- 
self familiar with their organization and practical results by visits to some of the

most celebrated State normal schools then in operation, at Westfield, Framingham, 
Albany, Oswego, Trenton, N. J., New Britain, Conn., and Ypsilanti, Mich., besides 
the training schools at Boston and Philadelphia. He quotes, in support of his views, 
the opinions of some eminent educators: Rey. James Fraser, of England, who had 
been sent to this country by the royal commission on education to investigate our 
system of common schools; Hon. Egerton Ryerson, chief superintendent of publie 
education for Upper Canada; M. Guizot, then minister of public instruction in 
France; Victor Cousin, Horace Mann, Josiah Quincy, Edward Everett, George S. 
Boutwell, Mark Hopkins, Barnas Sears, George B. Emerson, Joseph White, Birdsey 
G. Northrop, John D. Philbrick, and others. But the testimony of this cloud of 
witnesses weighed not a feather with the legislators of Ohio. Dr. White then goes 
on to set forth his plan for maintaining one State normal school in connection with 
ten State normal institutes at an expense of $20,000 a year, ‘‘a sum altogether insig- 
nificant when compared with the grand object it is to promote. The law making 
the appropriation might be called ‘an act appropriating $20,000 to keep the half of 
three millions of dollars from being squandered on incompetent teachers.’ ”” 
The lack of a State system of normal schools is to a certain extent compensated by 
teachers’ institutes, independent normal schools, and the opening of a normal 
department in the Ohio University with an experienced teacher as principal and 
professor. Among the independent normal schools may be mentioned the 
Nationat Normat Scuoon at Lepanon. 
In the summer of 1855 some of the leading teachers of southwestern Ohio called 
a convention for the purpose of establishing a normal school in the vicinity of Cin- 
cinnati. The call also contemplated an institute of three weeks to be held in the 
buildings of the Miami University at Oxford, Ohio. About 350 teachers assembled. 
in answer to the call. Among them were John Hancock, now gone to his rest, to 
his gain and our great loss, and Andrew J. Rickoff, still (1891) happily preserved to us. 
During this institute an organization was effected and legally incorporated, called 
The Southwestern State Normal School Association. The purpose was to estab- 
lish and sustain a State normal school in southwestern Ohio until State aid could be 
obtained. Lebanon was selected as the most eligible site for the school. The trus- 
tees of the Lebanon Academy transferred their building and grounds to the normal 
school trustees, with an agreement to furnish eighty pupils for five years to aid in 
sustaining the school. Alfred Holbrook was elected principal, ata salary of $1,200 a 
year, which he was expected to make out of the tuition fees. The school was opened 
in November, 1855, with about 95 pupils. For the first year the principal received, 
for his own and his wife’s services, $320. The school was then given entirely into 
the hands of the principal, who received for his services the second year $800, the 
other teachers getting the same proportion of their nominal salaries. The number 
of pupils registered during the year was 257. In the third year 335 pupils were 
enrolled. During the war the attendance fell off, but in 1866 the number of pupils 
-was 709, and the twentieth annual catalogue gives the names of 1,500 different 
pupils. The catalogue for the year 1890 specifies the following ‘‘departments :”’ 
School of common branches. Conservatory of music. 
Preparatory school. School of phonography and typewriting.

  NORMAL SCHCOLS IN THE UNITED STATES. 2357 
These departments are supervised and administered by the president with the aid 
of 53 instructors and officers.! 
In 1885 the legislature of Ohio made an appropriation for the éstablishment of a 
normal department in the Ohio University, the oldest collegiate institution north- 
west of the Ohio River. This action was a distinct recognition of the claims of 
normal education upon the State, and an indication that teachers are in need of pro- 
fessional preparation and are entitled to reasonable facilities for obtaining it. In 
accordance with this idea the college formulated two courses of study, a short course 
leading to a certificate, and a longer course leading to the degree of bachelor of peda- 
gogy. The following are the required subjects for the degree of bachelor of pedagogy:”

       As students who receive this degree are expected to have not only a theoretical 
knowledge of education as a science, but also some practical knowledge of it as an 
art, they are urgently recommended to acquire some experience by teaching before 
completing the course. For such teaching, if done under the direction of the pro- 
fessor in charge of this department, the student may receive credit as a part of his 
elective work. 
Psychology and the history of philosophy are regarded for the present as belong- 
ing to the normal department of the university; and, therefore, the methods of 
instruction in psychology may probably be taken as typical of the whole normal course. 
The following brief extracts from a monograph by the professor of psychology in 
the university throw some light on this important subject of ‘‘methods.”’ 
Teat-books.—The extent of text-book work in psychology is one of the first prac- 
tical questions that presents itself to the teacher. There is great danger that the 
work may become set, mechanical, and irreclaimably fixed in the lines of thought, 
and even of expression, of a text-book. Such abject servility may, to be sure, be

averted in some degree by original thought on the part of the instructor, but he will 
be singularly successful who entirely liberates his students from authorial despotism. 
Statements printed in cold type acquire a certain authority and repress independent 
unprejudiced thought. The tyrannical text-book is, moreover, very likely to banish 
from the class room the freshness and vivacity which distinguish oral discussion. 
These objections to text-books are, however, balanced by many considerations. 
As a fixed and permanent basis for class-room work, text-books are invaluable. It 
is only with great difficulty that a course which proceeds entirely by lecture and 
discussion is thoroughly followed and systematized. * * * 
Lectures or discussions?—Granting, then, that a considerable portion of the recita- 
tion period should be devoted to independent work, the alternative of lecture or of 
discussion is offered. In very large classes the lecture is the more effective way of 
covering a subject, for discussion being necessarily more or less individual is, owing 
to the numerous views presented, very liable to degenerate into aimless, profitless 
talk. * * * Certainly, if properly used, the lecture is invaluable in presenting 
clearly and systematically to a large number an otherwise unwieldy mass of mate- 
rial. The lecture, however, in affording no opportunity for the expression of the 
doubts and perplexities of the student, betrays a fundamental weakness. Error 
will persist far longer, and be eradicated with much more difiiculty than by the 
Socratic dialectic, for the lecture does not educe and thus correct or eliminate the 
student’s mistakes. It leaves him to stumble along by himself, and deprives him of 
close intellectual contact with the instructor. * * 
The three auxiliaries.—An ideal alliance of the instructor’s three auxiliaries might 
be negotiated somewhat on the following terms: The text-book should be used only 
in preparation for the recitation, and not, except in a very general way, for the con- 
duct of the recitation itself. Lectures intended to throw the subject under consider- 
ation in fresher and stronger lights should be frequently given and should form an. 
important, and indeed a vital, part of the course of study. The greater part of the 
class-room work, however, should assume the form of discussion of the subject-mat- 
ter furnished by text-books and lectures, while by the suggestive questions of the 
Socratic dialectic the student may be further aided and stimulated. - 
some such judicious combination of methods the field of psychology may be clearly 
and fully placed before the mind of the student, his interest roused and concentrated 
introspectively, and his power of original thought educed and developed.! . 
The supreme place which the study of psychology holds in the normal department 
of the Ohio University may be inferred from the following extracts from ‘‘An open 
letter to young teachers:’’ 
Neyer before in the history of the world has such emphasis been laid on the 
importance of studying mind and pedagogy and the history of education as at the 
present. Not merely in such highly civilized countries as France, England, Germany, 
and Italy, but in Mexico, in the South American Republics, even in Jamaica, there is 
abundant evidence to show that men are coming to see the absurdity of mind doctors 
who haye made no study of mind, of educational practitioners who have made no 
study of the art of education and the science that underlies it. * * * Do you 
intend to be a live teacher, determined to live by the best light of your own genera- 
tion, or a fossil contented to make such preparation as was deemed sufficient a hun- 
dred years ago? If you are determined to succeed, then you will try to give yourself 
the qualifications necessary to success. You are living to-day and what you need is 
an outfit suited to to-day and not to a hundred years ago. Where will you get this 
preparation? * * * You ought to attend an institution which makes a specialty of 
preparing teachers for their life k. How many institutions are there in the State which 
make a special study of mind, in its relations to education and which make a special study 
of the art and science of education? Unless I have been misinformed, there is but one, 
and that is the Ohio University at this place. [The italics are the author’s.] There are 
indeed other colleges which have normal departments, and there are normal schools, 
but itis not the name but the thing that you want, and the thing—an institution which 
makes a specialty of preparing teachers for their life work, by making a careful study of 
mind in its relation to education and of the science and art and history of education— 
is to be found in this State at Athens.”

INDIANA. 
Sate Normat Scuoou, Terre Havre. 
The first section of the constitution of Indiana contains the following article: 
“‘ Knowledge and learning generally diffused throughout a community being essen- 
tial to the preservation of a free government, it shall be the duty of the general 
assembly to encourage, by all suitable means, moral, intellectual, scientific, and 
agricultural improvement, and to provide by law for a general and uniform system 
of common schools wherein tuition shall be without charge and equally open to all.” 
In accordance with this constitutional provision it was enacted by the general assem- 
bly in 1865 ‘‘that there shall be established and maintained a State normal school, 
the object of which shall be the preparation of teachers for teaching in the common, 
schools of Indiana.’’ This act provided for the location and erection of a building 
the admission of students, the organization of the school, and the annual appropri- 
ation of funds for tuition and expenses. The diploma of the normal school is by 
law equivalent to a State certificate, relieving the holder from county examinations. 
The board of trustees has authority to grant certificates of proficiency to such teach- 
ers as have completed any of the prescribed courses of study, and to give diplomas 
to graduates who have taught satisfactorily for two years. By a recent order of the - 
board of trustees, all candidates fdr graduation are required to hold a county license 
-to teach for a period of not less than two years. 
The departments of the school are the following: Department of history and phi- 
losophy of education, of grammar and composition, of biology and geology, of read- 
ing, rhetoric, and literature, of history, of geography, of mathematics, of Latin, of 
mental science and methods, of music, of drawing and penmanship, of physics and 
chemistry. Each department is under the charge of a separate professor, with such 
assistants as are found necessary from time to time.

Nore.—Thirty-six terms’ work is necessary to complete this course. The subjects marked thus * are required; the remaining subjects may be elected by the student. 
The four years’ course is designed to meet the needs of those students who wish 
to make thorough and extended preparation for public school work. 
The three years’ course is intended for young persons of limited scholarship who 
expect to confine their teaching to the district and graded schools of the State. 
There is also a two, years’ course for graduates of commissioned high schools. 
Many cities do not maintain a training school for educating their own teachers, and 
this course is designed to supply the place of training schools for such cities, and 
thus to relieve the school officers from the necessity they feel of employing as teach- 
ers the graduates of their high schools who have had no training in teaching. 
In addition to the courses described, there is a course of one year for college grad- 
uates, to meet the needs of those graduates who wish to enter the field of teaching 
and superintending schools and who feel the need of professional training for this 
work. This course assumes that the student has already acquired a liberal knowl- 
edge of the subjects taught in the public schools, and that his purpose is to add such 
professional knowledge as college professors and school superintendents peculiarly 
need. 
The ‘practice work’? continues through two terms. It consists of observation 
and teaching in the practice schools, which form one department of the normal 
school. The pupils taught are children belonging to the regular grades of the Terre 
Haute school system. This work consists of three kinds—(1) Lessons given daily 
by the students before the practice class as a whole; (2) lessons given daily at differ- 
ent hours when none or only a part of the practice class is present; (3) the obser- 
vation of lessons given by the teacher in charge of the room. While a lesson is 
being taught the other members of the class take careful notes. On the following 
day it is carefully discussed by the members of the practice class and the teacher in 
charge of the room. In this discussion four things are done. (a) The point of the 
lesson is distinctly stated; (b) it is classed as favorable or unfavorable; (c) the 
principles that are the ground for considering it favorable are stated; (d) an expla- 
nation is made in order to show that the principles stated underlie the given act of 
teaching. 
The average term enrollment for the session 1890-91 was 526. The whole number

of different students was 932. The total number of different students since the 
organization of the school in 1870 is 6,943.1 
ILLINOIS. 
Srare Norman University. 
A general meeting of the friends of free schools assembled in Bloomington, Il., on 
December 26, 1853. Three topics were thoroughly discussed at this meeting: The 
duty of the legislature to create the office of State superintendent, to establish and 
maintain a normal school, and to organize a State teachers’ association. . The normal 
school question provoked a long and spirited debate, the same objections being urged 
as had been made twenty years before in other States and haye been annually 
repeated in some quarters ever since. 
After the adjournment of the convention the Illinois State Teachers’ Association 
was organized. The most prominent topic in all the early meetings of this associa- 
tion was the organization of anormal school. There were three parties in the con- 
test: The normal school men, who wanted a’separate institution for the exclusive 
purpose of training teachers; a large class of educators, who desired to have either 
an industrial university with a normal department or a normal school with an indus- 
trial department, and, thirdly, those who favored the founding of normal depart- 
ments by the State in connection with denominational colleges already established. 
At the meeting of the association in 1856 it was resolved ‘That the educational 
interests of Illinois demand the immediate establishment of a State normal school 
for the education of teachers.’ In the following February the legislature passed, 
and the governor approved, ‘‘An act for the establishment and maintenance of a 
normal university.” 
This act of the legislature provided for a university, although what was established 
was in factanormal school. The intention was to gather around the new institution 
the different colleges—classical, agricultural, industrial, law, medical, ete.—which 
should finally constitute a great university. 
It was the duty of the State board of education ‘‘to fix the permanent location of 
the normal university at the place where the most favorable inducements are offered 
for that purpose.’’ The board advertised for proposals, and several cities and towns 
competed for the prize. The bid of McLean County ($141,725 in real estate and sub- 
scription pledges) was so far ahead of the others that the board located the univer- 
sity ‘‘on the 160 acres of fine rolling land within three-quarters of a mile from the 
junction of the Illinois Central and Chicago and Alton railroads,’’ upon the condi-’ 
tion that the full amount of the McLean County subscription of $70,000 should be 
legally guaranteed within sixty days, in default of which the location was to be made 
at Peoria. They employed Abraham Lincoln to draw up a form of bond or guaranty 
to be signed by responsible citizens of Bloomington. 
The corner stone of the university building was laid on September 29, 1857, but 
the financial crisis of that year caused the work to be temporarily discontinued, and 
hence the buildings were not thoroughly completed until the early part of 1861. 
The total cost of the buildings, with all the incidental expenses, books, and furniture, 
was about $200,000, a large part of which was raised and utilized by the strenuous 
and persistent efforts of Gen. Charles E. Hovey. The courts having decided that 
the normal university was a private institution belonging to the board of education 
as a corporation, and therefore that the State was not liable for the debts of the 
board, the legislature of 1867 enacted and declared that the State Normal University 
is a State institution, the property of the State of Illinois, and held in trust by the 
board of education.

2362 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
During the long years while the great building was rising to completion the school 
work was carried on ina cramped and inconvenient building called Major’s Hall. It 
must have been a queer old place, and many of the inhabitants, teachers, and stu- 
dents were sui generis. H. B. Norton, one of the students of those early days, wrote 
thus to the committee of the Quarter-Centennial Celebration: 
We were daily convened in the upper story of Major’s Hall. I suppose that these 
younger generations of normalites are not aware that such a building ever existed. The 
walls of the old house were rickety, and iron girders with huge S’sat the ends held in 
place the brick masonry. Our assembling room was the third story. In the second 
story were recitation rooms, rather dark, and ill adapted to our needs. Grocery and 
hardware stores occupied the first floor. The building was heated bya coal stove in 
each room, and as Illinois coal is gaseous and explosive, the stove doors were fre- 
quently blown open with loud sounds and clouds of yellow smoke. - C. E. Hovey was 
principal in those days, but Ira Moore was the one most directly in charge. Dr. 
Willard, looking very pale and frail, soon began to open his wonderful budget of 
philological knowledge. Hewett came within a month after my arrival, [think. He 
was a small man with a big head in those days. He had very demonstrative boot 
heels, and especially hated cats, and went to sleep in Baptist meetings. He used to 
give us prodigious lessons in history and geography. He couldn’t draw maps, but 
made us draw very nice ones. I remember his geography lessons even unto this 
day. The names of the branches of the Amazon, the forms and heights of the 
Andean and Himalayan plateaus—these are mine yet, and will be to all eternity. 
My history work has not stayed with me so well. There was once a slight unpleas- 
antness between my class and their teacher as to how General Greene got away from 
Cornwallis. It was quite a double and twisted business anyhow, and we inwardly 
vowed that we wouldn’t learn it. The teacher gave us hard words and low marks, 
but our obstinate stupidity won the day. * * * We were shabbily dressed in 
those days. I think my pantaloons were generally too short, and my coat seemed to 
have been made for some other person. We were very poor but very plucky. We 
boarded ourselves, mainly on corn mush; washed the floors and built the fires at the 
normal hall, worked hard, lived hard, and were poorly provided with all things. Our 
parents were sad-faced, struggling pioneers of the prairies, but we were cheery, reso- 
lute, and happy in our life and our work. To the toiling youth of frontier homes 
thirsting for knowledge the Illinois Normal University opened the gateway to a new 
life. We loved it, rejoiced in it, and were thoroughly loyal to its name and fame. 
The school saw but little of its principal in those years. Two miles to the north- 
ward, across the sodden prairies, in the rainy autumn of 1858, were clay pits, heaps 
of brickbats, half complete foundations for a stately structure yet in embryo. The 
construction fund was exhausted, the State heavily in debt, business everywhere 
distressed and languishing—truly a somber prospect for the completion of a building 
demanding, on the basis existing before the war, $100,000. It would be as easy 
to-day to raise a million. To secure these needed funds was the task which Charles 
E. Hovey set before himself. It was a labor for Hercules. His own fortune was 
pledged over and over. Had his plans failed he would have been weighted for life 
-with hopeless bankruptcy. This enormous task he undertook and carried through. 
He had a place on the programme of the school’s daily work, but his classes gener- 
ally wrought out their own salvation. But in the winter of 1860-61 the buildin 
was completed. * * * We of the pioneering days need no reminder of the gran 
ul which could hardly have been performed by another than Gen. Charles E. 
covey. 
We were free in our conduct to a singular extent. No school rules rested upon us. 
Our hours and methods were wholly our own. We lived as we pleased, formed our 
friendships and associations, made our calls and managed our affairs entirely at our 
own choice and pleasure. Very few schools were ever so slightly governed. I do 
not believe that our successors of to-day can be journeying under any similar slack- 
ness of reins. Nevertheless, the record of those years was a thoroughly Spartan one. 
We were from Puritan households, disciplined in self-restraint. a aeee and 
poverty were our safeguards. 
A magnificent park, stately buildings, a beautiful and prosperous city, methods 
well ordered and polities established, splendid museums and laboratories, a wealthy 
and more cultured generation of students—these are the pleasant things that greet 
the view as you gather to the silver wedding of our Alma Mater. It is not true that 
the former days were better than these, but we who saw the working out of the 
beginnings had also our joys, struggles, and coronations, and we received a training

which, if less orderly and exhaustive than that rendered now, nevertheless gave us 
some measure of fitness for our life work." 
The first president of the university was Charles E. Hovey, but at the beginning 
of the civil war he entered the Army as colonel of the Normal Regiment, which he 
had organized. Nine of the instructors—Leander H. Potter, Ira Moore, J. H. Burn- 
ham, Aaron Gove, Julian E. Bryant, Joseph G. Howell, Edwin Philbrook, Samuel 
Willard, and E. R. Roe—accompanied him as officers, and a majority of the male 
Students as privates. Dr. Richard Edwards was president from 1862 to 1876; Dr. 
Edwin C. Hewett from 1876 to 1891. 
John W. Cook is the present president (1892). 
The faculty of 1892 consists of the president and 22 professors and assistants. The 
“summary”? of the normal department shows 5 special students, 29 seniors, 21 
middle class A, 86 middle class B, 117 middle C, 91 junior A, 138 junior B, 241 
junior C; total in normal department, 688.

2. To produce a certificate of moral character. 
8. To sign the following declaration: 
Ihereby solemnly declare that my purpose in attending the normal university is 
to fit me for teaching in the public schools of Illinois and that I will carry out this 
pledge in good faith; and I do further pledge myself to report to the president of the 
university semiannually where I am and what I am doing for three years after 
graduating at said institution. 
4, To pass an examination before the county school superintendent in reading, 
spelling, writing, arithmetic, geography, United States history, and the elements of 
English grammar sufficient to entitle them to a second-grade teachers’ certificate. 
Each county in the State is entitled to gratuitous instruction for two pupils im the 
normal university, and each representative district for as many pupils as there are 
representatives in the district. The selection is made in the following manner: The 
school superintendent of each county receives and registers the names of all appli- 
cants; these applicants are examined, and from the number found to possess the 
requisite qualifications the pupils are selected by lot. The same mode of selection 
obtaiis in the representative districts. If vacancies occur in any county or repre- 
sentative district the president of the university is authorized to fill them. 
Graduates from the normal department are entitled to receive a State certificate 
good for five years. 
. LABORATORY METHODS. 
The pupil enters the laboratory and finds on the table before him some apparatus, 
accompanying which are some printed directions of what he is to do with the mate- 
rial before him. After seeing that his apparatus is in proper order he proceeds as 
directed, and haying completed the experiment, at once writes out neatly, accu- 
rately, and tersely the experiment in full, embracing these points: (1) What I did; 
(2) What I saw; (3) What I conclude. (Ruled tablets of uniform size are used for 
this work, and at the close of the term the leaves which are daily detached for the 
separate exercises are bound in permanent form.) The pupil writes up his work 
without consulting the text-book or his fellow pupils, and hands his results to the 
instructor before beginning another experiment. (Should his work be unsatisfac- 
tory, he is required to perform it again until the intended facts are made clear to him. 
After a few days’ work, repetition is seldom needed.) The pupil is thus taught to 
be independent in his efforts and to cultivate his reasoning powers. He acquires 
control of his hands; he learns how to put things together and get results; he stud- 
ies things in relations; he prepares himself for everyday life, whether it be in the 
schoolroom, in the workshop, or in whatever department of life. 
The experiments are arranged in systematic order, so that the pupil is led step by 
step into a more complete knowledge of the subject under consideration. The appa- 
ratus is as simple and inexpensive as it is possible to use and be assured of good re- 
sults; andpupils are taught how to construct it, so that they can teach this work in 
the common schools without waiting forexpensive, showy apparatus to be furnished 
by school boards. * * * About onehundred experiments are performed each 
term.! 
Sournern Inuuinoris Norman University, CARBONDALE. 
The act of incorporation was passed in 1869, but classes were not opened till 1874, 
owing to unavoidable delays in the commencement and in the completion of the 
building. It was a magnificent building—almost too magnificent. The young ladies 
complained of the fatigue of climbing four lofty stories, and the height of the ceil- 
ings prevented the comfortable heating of the rooms by the furnaces originally used. 
Sixteen thousand dollars expended in steam-heating apparatus put an end to all 
complaints on the last count, and an accidental fire November 26, 1883, reduced the 
height of the ceilings to zero. It broke out in the mansard story over the Museum. 
Water tanks had been provided for such emergency, but unfortunately they were 
below the fire, and water will not rise above its level even in a university. An effort 
was made to bring into service the small fire engine belonging to the university, but

owing to ‘‘a defect in the construction of the water pipes’’ a stream could not be 
thrown on the fire. Four elements of safety were present, water, hose, engine, and ° 
willing hands, but they could not be correlated, and in less than two hours the 
house was in ruins. The willing hands saved all that could be saved—books, furni- 
ture, apparatus, even doors and windows, valued at $75,000, including the basement 
and the walls that were still standing.

On the evening of the fire, while the embers were still smoking, the mayor of 
Carbondale called a mass meeting of the citizens. It was resolved to build a tempo- 
rary schoolhouse, and in less than forty working days the students were installed in 
their new quarters, a comfortable frame building with fourteen rooms. Here the 
school rested for four years till the completion of the permanent building, for which 
the general assembly in 1885 made an appropriation of $152,065. 
The school work is conducted in three distinct departments—the normal, the high 
school, and the preparatory. The preparatory is subdivided into grammar school, 
intermediate, and primary. By the last catalogue (1891-92) there were in attend- 
ance in the normal department 342 students; in the high school, 41; in the prepara- 
tory, 315 (grammar school 239, intermediate 38, primary 38)—total, 698. The 
average per term was 452. 
To be admitted to the normal department students must have completed their 
sixteenth year and must be able to pass an examination equivalent to the require- 
ments of a second-grade certificate. To obtain free tuition a student must sign a

pledge to teach in the public schools of the State for three years, or at least as long 
. as he has been a student of the university. The pledge comes into effect only after 
graduating and onthe expressed condition that ‘‘a situation can be had with reasonable 
effort.”’ All graduates recommended by the faculty and approved by the board of 
trustees are entitled to a State certificate, granted by the State superintendent of 
public instruction, good in any county of the State for five years. 
TRAINING DEPARTMENT. 
The strictly professional work of our normal school is made up of three distinct 
parts, in the first of which are found practical and economic pedagogy. In practi- 
cal pedagogy our pupils are giyen, by text-book and lecture, a knowledge in outline 
of the child’s powers and the order of their development. By the same methods, 
also, they are given a knowledge of the methods of teaching the branches usually 
found in the common schools. In economic pedagogy the attention of pupils is 
directed to the organization and management of schools and classes, to the end that 
every child in school or class shall secure his individual and personal right to instrue- 
tion and training. The discussion of special subjects in both practical and economic 
pedagogy is followed by reports of observations made in the training school, the 
reports covering the special topics previously discussed. After the economic peda- 
gogy, and as a supplement to it, the school law of the State is taken up and its chief 
provisions mastered. 
The student of pedagogy, having completed the elementry course pointed out in 
the preceding paragraph, is put in charge of a class, and his work as teacher is care- 
fully supervised. The preliminary stu oF methods has put him in a state to teach 
and manage his class intelligently, and has given him increased power to profit by 
the superintendent’s instructions. One year of this practice teaching is required of 
all whoare graduated from ourschool. The daily task, not counting the preparation, 
covers about half an hour of time. This teaching work covers the second section of 
the course in pedagogy. 
Having completed the first two divisions of the professional course, the student is 
prepared to take up the higher pedagogical studies. These include a full course in 
psychology, a thoughtful discussion ofthe conditional principles of all right teaching, 
and a study of men and methods prominent in past educational efforts. For 
the advanced course, then, the studies are psychologic, philosophic, and advanced 
pedagogy. As an aid to easy reference the three branches of the higher course are 
grouped and known as theoretic pedagogy, and for the same reason the three in the 
elementary course are collected and recognized as practical pedagogy. 
MICHIGAN. 
Stare Normat Scwoon, YPstLanri. 
The State Normal School of Michigan was established by the legislature in 1849. 
The organic law reads as follows: 
Be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the State of Michigan, That 
a State normal school be established, the exclusive purpose of which shall be the 
instruction of persons, both male and female, in the art of teaching and in all the 
various branches that pertain to a good common-schooi education; also to give 
instruction in the mechanic arts and in the arts of husbandry and agricultural chem- 
istry, in the fundamental laws of the United States, and in what regards the rights 
and duties of citizens, 
Commenting on this enactment, Superintendent Gregory, in his report for 1859, 
says: 
The main design is to be a school for teachers, where they may receive instruction 
peculiarly adapted to their profession, though the law contains some rhetorical flour- 
ishes about giving instruction in the mechanic arts and in the arts of husbandry and 
agricultural chemistry, etc. The normal school is to the primary schools what 
theological seminaries are to the churches. It is simply the teachers’ college and a 
school for professional training. 
But the desire for normal schools was manifested long before the enactment of this 
Jaw. In 1836 Superintendent Pierce, in his official report, wrote enthusiastically on 
  
1 John Hull, president elect of Southern Ilinois Normal University, in report to the superintendent 
of public instruction, 1884.

the merits of the Prussian system and recommended the adoption of a similar plan 
in Michigan. His successors, Superintendents Sawyer, Comstock, and Mayhew kept 
up the agitation, and it was during the superintendency of the last that the law just 
quoted was passed by the legislature. 
Proposals were received by the board of education from several points in the State, 
each offering to donate lands and sums of money to secure the location of the school. 
The most favorable came from Ypsilanti, offering an eligible lot for a building site, a 
subscription of $13,500, the use of temporary buildings, and the payment of the 
salaries of the teachers of the model school for five years. The State board of educa- 
tion enlarged the grounds and erected a brick building at a cost of $15,200, which 
was ready for use in the autumn of 1852. This building was partly destroyed by fire 
in 1859, but was rebuilt and ready for the reception of students in September, 1860. 
An additional building was finished in 1869. Other much-needed buildings were 
added in 1878 and 1882. The entire cost of all the buildings from the establishment 
of the school to the last-named year was about $84,000, Since that time extensive 
alterations and additions have been made at the cost of $60,000, and there is now 
ample accommodation for an annual attendance of 900 students in the normal and 
300 in the other departments. 
The management of this school was for several years a series of experiments. It 
was not intended at first to be a purely professional school. It oceupied the educa- 
tional field in common with other literary and scientific institutions, but provided in 
addition some training in the science and aft of teaching. The question was seriously 
discussed in the State Teachers’ Association and elsewhere whether it was not time 
for the normal school to abandon academic work and maintain a true American nor- 
mal school, devoted exclusively to professional instruction and training. The State 
board of education was requested by the faculty to prepare a course of study adapted. 
to the proposed new departure. The committee appointed by the State board to 
inyestigate the subject reported that the normal school should, if possible, be brought 
more into sympathy with the high schools of the State, and should assume a more 
purely professional character. For the accomplishment of these objects two plans 
were suggested. One was to elevate the standard of academic attainment required 
for admission and to remodel the course of study so as to combine academical and 
professional study during theentire course. Theother plan was to require all academic 
preparation to be made prior to admission to the normal school. The committee did 
not recommend either plan, but proposed a compromise, which was adopted and met 
the fate of all compromises—failure to attain either object. It was abandoned after 
a trial of about two years. There were many districts in Michigan, as there are still 
in every State, in which it is impossible for young persons to obtain academic instruc- 
tion suitable in kind and adequate in extent to serve as a basis for a purely profes- 
sional normal course; and these are the very places where the need of trained teachers 
is most urgent. 
In the summer of 1871 a new departure was made in the constitution of the school 
of observation and practice. A plan similar to that followed at the Oswego Normal 
School was tried fgr two years, but proved unsatisfactory and was abandoned. It 
was found that the practice school must be entirely under the same management and 
control as the normal. Divided authority is fatal to efficiency.? 
As the normal school is now organized (register of 1890) students are offered a 
choice from several courses of study, arranged to meet the demands of the various 
grades of schools and the needs of different classes of teachers. Students graduating 
in any of the courses are entitled to a certificate of qualification to teach in the pub- 
lic schools of Michigan. The three-year courses lead to such a certificate, good for 
five years. The four-year courses lead to a life certificate and a diploma. The 
advanced. (six-year) courses and the course for college graduates lead to the degree

of bachelor of pedagogy. In all the courses certain studies are ‘‘required’’ and cer- 
tain others are ‘‘elective;” that is to say, chosen by the student, with the advice and 
consent of the principal. Any person holding the degree of bachelor of pedagogy in 
this school may upon application receive the degree of master of pedagogy upon the 
following conditions: (a) He shall furnish evidence satisfactory to the State board of 
education that he has been engaged in teaching or in school supervision continuously 
and with pronounced success for five years since receiving the bachelor degree; (6) 
he shall prepare and present a thesis acceptable to the State board of education upon 
some subject connected with the history, science, or art of education, the board 
reserving the right to assign the subject of such thesis. 
In defending the right of the normal school to give advanced academic instruction 
the principal says: 
The function of the normal school is to equip teachers both professionally and 
academically for duty in any place in these public schools to which they may be 
called, whether such schools are primary or secondary in the character of the instruc- 
tion offered by them. No teacher is so equipped unless his own studies have been 
carried considerably beyond the limit to which he is required to conduct his own 
pupils. It follows, then, that the normal school graduate ought to be furnished 
with an education that carries him considerably beyond the limits of any secondary 
education that he may be called upon to give. In other words, he ought to pursue 
his own course of training so far that there shall be an ample margin between what 
he knows and what he may at any time be called upon to teach. * * * This 
margin of knowledge in case of those who complete advanced courses in this normal 
school comprises a liberal course in literature, art, and science.!

The enrollment in the normal school proper in 1870-71 was 231, and the number 
increased gradually and regularly till the end of the year 1876, when the number was 
449. In each of the next seven years the enrollment was less than 400, but in the 
year 1883-84 it sprung up to 475, and every succeeding year has shown an annual 
increase, the number in 1890-91 being 909. During its existence it has graduated 
1,761 young men and women, nearly all of whom became public school teachers in 
Michigan. The average number of graduates in the last five classes exceeded 100. 
The general supervision and control of the school is in the hands of the State board 
of education, consisting of three members elected by the people and holding office 
for six years, together with the State superintendent of public instruction, who is a 
member and secretary of the board, ex officio.

  The training school is a department of the normal school. It is organized as a 
regular eight-grade school of 250 pupils and a well-equipped kindergarten of 24 
children below regular school age. The course of study extends from the kinder- 
garten to the high school, and embraces the subjects and amounts of work usually 
required in first-class city graded schools. The work in the training department is 
under the charge of the director, assisted by two critic teachers, a model primary 
teacher, and a kindergartner. Under careful supervision of this normal corps the 
actual teaching is, in the main, in the hands of the senior class. These are assigned 
to the work of teaching and observing by the director, and are daily met for criticism 
and instruction by him or by the critic teachers. The model primary room is con- 
ducted as a school of observation.” 
WISCONSIN. 
Normani Experiments. 
The legislature of Wisconsin in 1857 passed a law entitled ‘‘An act for the encour- 
agement of academies and normal schools,’’ appropriating 25 per cent of the interest 
arising from the sale of the swamp lands of the State for the purpose of aiding such 
colleges and academies as might comply with certain regulations. The design of the 
law was twofold: First, to aid institutions of learning which had labored efficiently in 
the cause of education, although they had hitherto been entirely dependent on private 
enterprise for their support. Second, to enable such institutions to render an equiva- 
lent for the funds received from the State by preparing persons for teaching. For the 
carrying out of this law a board of regents was established, consisting of the Gover- 
nor and the State superintendent of public instruction ex officio, but without a vote, 
and 9 members appointed by the Governor, by and with consent of the Senate. 
This board of regents had authority to make all by-laws and needful regulations for 
carrying into effect the provisions of the act not inconsistent with the constitution 
and by-laws of the State. Section 10 provided that all the income of the fund con- 
templated by the act shall be distributed to the colleges, universities, and academies 
severally (except the State University) which shall establish and maintain normal 
classes in proportion to the number of pupils instructed in such classes, according to 
regulations prescribed by the board of regents, until the amount awarded to any one 
of such schools shall reach the sum of $3,000 annually. It was further provided that 
whenever any town, city, or village in the State shall propose to give a site and suit-

able buildings and fixtures for a State normal school, the board of regents may in 
their discretion apportion to the same annually a sum not exceeding $3,000 for the 
support and maintenance of teachers therein. 
The board of regents, looking doubtle:s to the experience of the New York 
* academies, appear to have been anxious to prevent the academies aided under this 
act from becoming mere high schools with a normal annex—on paper. They say 
that the following subjects must be studied in the normal department: ‘‘ Education, 
its nature and design; physical education; intellectual education; moral education; 
eesthetical education; the history of education; an examination of the powers of the 
mind, especially with reference to receiving and communicating knowledge; school- 
house architecture; organization and classification of schools; modes of teaching 
different subjects; rewards and punishments; the office of teacher, his duties to him- 
self, his school, and the public; the duty of the State in reference to educating its 
citizens; the educational policy of Wisconsin.’’ It was proposed that these studies 
should be carried on chiefly by the aid of lectures and in connection with the two 
years’. course in ordinary academic branches. Students, before being admitted, 
were required to pass an examination on reading, spelling, arithmetic, elementary 
algebra, physiology, history of the United States, descriptive geography, and com- 
position. 
At the meeting of the board of regents in 1859 the following course of study was 
adopted: 
First year.—Higher arithmetic, algebra, Latham’s English Language, plane and 
solid geometry, drawing, Anglo-Saxon roots and derivations, chemistry, theory and 
practice of teaching. 
Second year.—Trigonometry and surveying, botany, physiology, natural philosophy, 
geology, meteorology, rhetoric, physical geography, theory and practice of teaching. 
Third year.—Constitutional history; Latin, French, or German; comparative philol- 
ogy, logic, intellectual philosophy, analytical geometry, calculus, descriptive geome- 
try, drawing, educational history. 
In 1859 Dr. Henry Barnard, of Connecticut, was appointed agent of the board of 
regents with instructions ‘‘to visit and exercise a supervisory control over the normal 
departments of all such institutions as should apply for a participation in the normal- 
school fund, and to conduct county teachers’ institutes and give normal instruction 
inthesame.”’ Dr. Barnard’s labors had a stimulating and encouraging effect, but they 
were unfortunately cut short by a long period of severe illness. 
In 1860, twenty institutions presented claims for a share in the normal fund 
in proportion to the number of pupils in each who had pursued normal studies 
according to the requirements of the board of regents. Among these institutions 
$4,640 were distributed, in sums varying from $40 to $740. The institutions to which 
these sums were distributed were Beloit College, Lawrence University, Galesville 
University, Wisconsin Female College, Milwaukee Female College, Platteville Acad- 
emy, Milton Academy, Walworth County Institute, River Falls Academy, Richland 
City Institute, Allen’s Grove Academy, Horicon High School, Kenosha High School, 
Oshkosh High School, Racine High School, Janesville High School, Fond du Lac 
High School, Beaver Dam High School. Five of these expanded afterwards into 
State normal schools—Platteville, River Falls, Oshkosh, Walworth (Whitewater), and 
Milwaukee. 
Srare Norma Scroor Sysrem. 
In Wisconsin, as in Pennsylvania, the county institutes were the immediate ances- 
tors of the normal schools. In the year 1860 there were held 47 institutes, reaching 
81 different counties and bringing together 4,346 teachers and persons interested in 
the cause of education. In connection with these institutes there were delivered 
200 public addresses, which reached at least 10,000 persons directly interested in the
-P-A-G-E-1133

cause of public instruction. By these means new life was given to the school sys- 
tem of the State. Patrons of the schools were led to know what good schools are and 
how they are to be obtained. Teachers were led to think and to strive to qualify 
themselves better for their responsibilities. In the schools new and more rational 
methods of instruction began to be adopted in place of the old-time rote system. 
The demand for institutes was greater than the supply, and the desire found its sat- 
isfaction only in the establishment of normal schools. 
The State Normal School at Platteville was opened in 1866, at Whitewater in 
1868, at Oshkosh in 1871, at River Falls in 1875, and at Milwaukee in 1885. 
The exclusive purpose of these normal schools, as expressed in the organic law of 
1857, was ‘‘the instruction and training of persons, both male and female, in the 
theory and art of teaching and in all the various branches that pertain to a common- 
school education, and in all subjects needful to qualify.for teaching in the public 
schools; also to give instruction in the fundamental law of the United States and of 
this State in what regards the rights and duties of citizens.’’ It will be seen from 
this that in these schools academic instruction was at first not only permissible but 
mandatory; consequently they were obliged to maintain preparatory departments. 
The following are at present the requirements for admission: 
      
1. Any applicant holding the diploma showing that he has satisfactorily completed 
the course of study for common schools as laid down in the manual of the depart- 
ment of public instruction will be admitted to the junior preparatory without exami- 
nation. 
2. Any candidate will be admitted without examination to the senior preparatory 
(a) who holds a full third-grade certificate gained within one year, or (6) who fur- 
nishes satisfactory evidence of having completed the second year’s work in any free 
high school of this State, or one of equivalent course. 
3. Any candidate who holds a duly signed diploma of graduation from any high 
school in the State, or who holds a first-grade certificate, still in force, granted by 
any school superintendent in Wisconsin, will be admitted to normal courses without 
examination. 
Other candidates for admission are examined thoroughly in arithmetic, geography, 
spelling, penmanship, reading, and English grammar. The following set of ques- 
tions will indicate the standard for admission in arithmetic. ‘The questions in other 
subjects are nearly of the same grade.

grade county certificate and who furnish proof of three years’ successful experience 
in teaching are admitted. 
The ordinary professional work.of the schools is distributed through the elementary 
course and the last year of the advanced course, and includes school economy, school 
organization, school management, school law, theory of teaching, history of educa- 
tion, mental science, and twenty weeks’ practice in the model school for each stu- 
dent. The instruction in this department is given partly by conversation lectures 
and partly from text-books. The text-books of this class used in the Whitewater 
school are Raub’s School Management, Wisconsin School Laws, Burke’s Laws of 
Public Schools, Swett’s Methods of Teaching, Sully’s Psychology, Quick’s Educa- 
tional Reformers, Browning’s History of Educational Theories, White’s Elements of 
Pedagogy, Bain’s Education as a Science.

  The training department or model school in the several normal schools is conducted 
in three divisions, primary, intermediate, and grammar; there being three grades (one 
year each) in the first, three in the second, and two in the third. Some idea of the 
‘“‘methods”’ used and recommended may be formed from the subjoined outline of the 
primary course in reading, taken without abridgment from the catalogue of the State 
Normal School at Oshkosh, for the year 1889. 
Reading. ° 
PRIMARY GRADE, FIRST YEAR. 
I. Before coming to school the child has made progress in spoken language to such 
an extent that he can enunciate the words of a vocabulary more or less extended, and 
he associates with those words the ideas they express. , 
As reading, in its beginnings, is learning to recognize in written or printed signs 
words already familiar to the learner in spoken language, economy, simplicity, and 
the necessity of interesting the child all demand that the words chosen for this first 
work should come from the child’s own vocabulary and possess a lively interest for 
him. This vocabulary may be ascertained and interest secured by leading the child, 
by conversation upon some familiar object—one present is best—to furnish the 
words for his own first lesson; and, as ideas in isolation are less instructive than 
those in relation, get him to furnish a sentence, thus leading him from the first to use 
the unit of expression. 
This sentence should be written upon the board with its initial capital and 
terminated with its appropriate punctuation mark. : 
Lead the child to talk about the idea expressed that the association between form. 
and sound and sense may be fully established. 
II. Isolate the word that has the liveliest interest for the pupil and have him copy 
it upon his slate. 
This primarily to impress the outline of the word upon his memory. 
Incidentally, writing and spelling are begun. 
After a few words haye been taught, compare the form of those words in such a 
way that the pupil will begin to realize that words are made up of parts. For 
example, erase the h in hat and ask what the word thus obtained is. Then place ¢ 
before the last word and ask what it now is. Call the letters which you erase and 
substitute by name that the pupil may learn the names of any which he does not 
already know. 
III. By easy work in phonic comparison enable the child to master the pro- 
nunciation of new words. For example, the child is acquainted with the word at; 
also with the powers of b, f, m, and p in words already known. If these elements 
are uttered and followed by the word ‘‘at’”’ the pupil will easily recognize the words 
bat, fat, mat, and pat thus formed. 
IV. Draw out the pupils to make stories about present objects, or familiar 
objects not present, or pictures, thus cultivating language and furnishing reading » 
matter in which they will take an interest. This should be written upon the board 
and read one or more times by the members of the class. For seat work, this 
should be copied by the class upon their slates. 
Y. Change from script to print, preparatory to taking up the reading book, by 
using a chart having words in both texts side by side, or by means of cards prepared 
by the teacher for that purpose.    
 
-P-A-G-E-1136
  2376 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
VI. Work should early be begun in helping the child to quickly recognize the 
form of words with which he is already somewhat familiar, thus preventing a drawl- 
ing and unnatural style in reading. To accomplish this, the teacher may point out 
and the child pronounce the most difficult words before he begins the reading of any 
articular passage or paragraph. Keep a list of the words studied upon the black- 
Heer where it can easily be seen by the class. Make sentences from this list, vary- 
ing the arrangement as much as possible. Add the new words as learned.- Review 
constantly. He should by some or all means be led to discriminate between word 
pronouncing and reading. : 
VII. As it is easier to prevent than to cure, from the first pay careful attention to 
enunciation, correct pitch, and correct inflections. 
See that the pupil reads in distinct, pleasant tones, with distinct articulation. Do 
not allow a high, strained key. By arousing the child’s imagination, get him to use 
the same key and inflections which he would use were he talking instead o1 reading. 
The teacher should, as often as necessary, assist by furnishing a model 
motto is, ‘‘Talk when you read; read as you should talk.’”? This necessitates an 
understanding, on the part of the pupil, of what he reads. 
Make sure by questions and explanations that he understands what he is to read 
before he begins. Encourage him to find out all he can for himself, by examining 
the pictures illustrating his lessons. 
VIII. Voice culture should begin with the child’s school work. Attention should 
be paid to the position of the child, whether sitting or standing, while producing 
tones. Judicious breathing exercises and vocal gymnastics should be practiced. 
Pleasant, natural, flexible tones should be secured and practiced by pupil and teacher. 
Singing and reading should go hand in hand, and it is desirable that the same teacher 
should teach both. Occasional exercises in simultaneous reading should be given, but 
the teacher must carefully guard against harsh tones and indistinct utterance. 
IX. Finish the First Reader, and before taking the Second be sure that the child 
has had all the supplementary reading that is necessary to make him thoroughly 
feauliat with the meaning, pronunciation, and spelling of all the words he has thus 
far had.   
  
PRIMARY GRADE, SECOND YEAR. 
I. The method given in the first year’s work for pronouncing new words by means 
of aio comparison should be continued and expanded. If the books in use fur- 
nish no lists for phenic spelling the teacher should select such a list from the lesson 
to be read, and by comparing these new or unfamiliar words with those already 
known, lead the child to determine for himself their pronunciation. This phase of 
the work may well be emphasized, however, not beyond the point of lively interest 
for the pupil. 
Provide seat work for pupils of this grade by selecting from the succeeding lesson, 
and arranging in lists those words which have parts in common, as rack, lack, back, 
whack. Head these lists by similar words familiar to them and set them to determin- 
ing for themselves the pronunciation of the unfamiliar ones. Ask them to copy 
upon their slates those which they thus determine and bring them to class. 
II. Continue the method given in the first year’s work for securing a ready pro- 
nunciation of words which are pronounced only with hesitation. 
For creating and sustaining an interest in fe lesson, precede the reading it by 
some carefully considered questions. 
These should be of such a nature as will stir the imagination to see what is really 
in the lesson, and secure an interest in it. Care should be taken that the impression 
gained should not be dimmed by too much questioning or the admission of irrelevant 
questions. 
If the pupil understands what he reads he will be interested if the selection is 
suitable. 
III. Methods for securing expressive reading may be extended in this year’s 
work, and may be considered under two heads, viz, the physical element and the 
mental element. 
(A) As physical power is so large a factor in expressive reading,’as good a degree 
as possible should be secured by attention to the following exercises: (1) Good 
standing position, including carriage of the head and shoulders. (2) Good supply 
of breath, secured by judicious breathing exercises. (3) Good articulation. The 
work in phonic spelling will do much toward the accomplishment of this. Classify 
lists of words or phrases involving skill in articulation, and give the class a three or 
five minute drill before beginning the reading lesson. 
Secure good pronunciation and enunciation by a similar drill. 
Pupils readily engage in and are profited by gymnastic drill of the speech and 
vocal organs 
   
-P-A-G-E-1137
  NORMAL SCHOOLS IN THE UNITED STATES. 2377 
(B) Mental element. Cultivate this element by the following means: (1) By the 
methods used for making the pupil understand what he reads (see 11). (2) By 
assisting the pupil’s imagination. The following are a few of the many ways in 
which this may be done. Let pupil A ask a question or make a statement to B, 
standing by his side. Then let B go across the room or outside the door while A 
repeats his remark or question. This would constitute a lesson in force. Let a pupil 
read something expressive of joy and follow it, at once, by something expressive of 
pity, thus getting him to use different degrees of pitch. Compare pure and whis- 
pered qualities of voice by reading something expressive of joy, followed by some- 
thing expressive of fear or secrecy. Teach degrees of rate in a similar way. 
Assign the different parts of a colloquy to different pupils and have them take 
their places before the class to read it. 
Novrz.—Strong force, low pitch, and impure quality should not be taught to 
immature voices. 
(3) By relieving the mind of the task of doing too many things at once. 
Have the pupil recite selections from memory. 
In this way he may expend his mental energy in expressing thought and feeling 
and be relieved of the task of recognizing word forms, of keeping the place in the 
book, and of holding the book itself. 
IV. As the object of all this is good reading, and as this can be secured only by 
much practice, get as much reading as possible done by the class. 
Have the reviews read by one pupil, the others listening. 
If the teacher will sometimes read the review to the class, the pupils will be inter- 
ested and profited. 
Let the class read selections at sight, or those to which they have given no previous 
study. This will aid them in quickly recognizing word forms and enable them to do 
more reading than they otherwise could. 
Care should be taken, however, that the selections for sight reading should not be 
too difficult. 
Appoint individuals to, prepare and read before the class selections which the 
others in the class have not seen. 
V. Finish the Second Reader and furnish supplementary reading sufficient to 
make the pupil thoroughly familiar with the vocabulary thus far gained. Narratives 
are better for this purpose than additional readers of the same grade. 
  PRIMARY GRADE, THIRD YEAR. 
I. The methods of work at this stage suggest themselyes when we attempt to 
answer the following questions: 
1) What has the lesson told the child? ; 
2) Can he express by means of the voice, and with distinctness and fluency, that 
which the lesson has told him? 
II. To make the results under the first head as full as possible, the following steps 
are suggested: 
(1) An explanation by the teacher of those allusions which the pupils do not 
understand. 2 
(2) Lead the pupils to determine for themselves the new idea in a sentence when 
it contains one that is obvious. 
(3) Get at the meaning of difficult words by aid of the context or by placing 
these words in such sentences that more light will be thrown upon their meaning. 
Call out from the class synonyms for these difficult words, if possible. 
(4) Have the pupils paraphrase the little poems in their readers. 
Nore.—These suggestions assume that the reading matter is on a level with the 
comprehension of the pupil, and that, therefore, this will aid, not crowd out, the 
actual practice in reading. ‘ 
As sentences are vehicles not only of thought, but emotion, no pupil should be 
allowed to feel satisfied with his work when he has expressed thought only, 
especially in sentences where the emotion predominates, as is often the case in the 
reading for this grade. It is not easy to give general directions for the accomplish- 
ment of this desirable result, but it can be done, if the teacher and pupils are in 
such close sympathy that she can interest them strongly in that which interests her. 
If the above conditions can be established, then give simple directions, good 
examples, and abundant practice. 
III. For the purpose of securing distinct, fluent utterance, practice the exercises 
given for that purpose in the first and second year’s work. 
Let them also give short whispering exercises. 
Have the final consonant, or consonants, distinctly given; but do not emphasize 
this practice to the sacrifice of fluency.  
-P-A-G-E-1138
  2378 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99, 
During this year require the pupils to establish the habit of looking up from the 
text while reading. A valuable sight drill and greater naturalness of expression are 
secured by this. 
Teach the marking of the long and the short vowels. 
IV. The power to articulate clearly and easily, and to command varied rate, pitch, 
force, and quality, must become automatic or no such thing as expressive reading is 
possible. arly training may make these processes as automatic as walking or the 
use of the pen; but if the consideration is deferred until late in school life it will 
only be accomplished in those cases where the ambition is strong enough to submit 
the pupil to a fone and tedious discipline. 
Y. Finish the Third Reader and increase the amount of supplementary reading. 
Practice TEACHING. 
The principal of the Oshkosh school, in his report for 1878-79, writes: 
The work of practice teaching has been increased and improved until the problem 
whether a student teacher could ever be trained to control and discipline a class as 
in his own school has ceased to be a question. As in other phases of training, some 
learn the art with difficulty, and are required to work a longer period, but nothing 
is more clearly proved than the fact that tact in teaching is a cultivable trait. 
Tae KINDERGARTEN. 
After much deliberation and discussion of the principles, objects, and practices of 
the kindergarten, the board of regents determined to establish a kindergarten in one 
of the normal schools as a model for observation and practice. Accordingly, they 
opened at Oshkosh what they claimed to be the “first kindergarten officially and 
directly connected with any State normal school in the United States.’’ ! 
Kindergarten culture [says the report for 1880] is designed to correct many of the 
faults of our common schools, where knowledge is generally imparted in a concen- 
trated form by teachers and text-books; where the child is crammed with the great- 
est possible amount of what might be termed positive knowledge in the least possible 
time, in many instances to the detriment of his healthy development. Kindergarten 
work will develop healthfully and harmoniously all the faculties of the child, as an 
organism that needs but to have its surroundings brought into harmony with its 
nature to grow into beauty and usefulness. It does not drive, but leads. The rest- 
less disposition of a child, so trying to the parent and the teacher, and so often firmly 
repressed, is made useful and a source of happiness and pleasure to the true kinder- 
gartner. The methods and discipline ordinarily pursued in our common schools 
haye a tendency to dwarf the physical development of a child. The kindergarten 
cultivates the same by frequent changes and a wise combination of exercises of body 
and mind. * * * Kindergartening in the common schools of our State may not 
be an accomplished fact for many years to come, but the board of regents have 
thought it wise to give our normal pupils a theoretical and practical knowledge of 
its principles, aims, methods, and apparatus, in order that they may be able to appl 
those methods and principles in their future school work as far as circumstances ate 
permit. If our students are to be missionaries for higher views of education, they 
should certainly be made acquainted with all the educational systems and methods 
deserving consideration. Among these systems none have received more earnest atten- 
tion at the hands of prominent educators than Froebel’s system of kindergartening. 
The experience of the school more than fulfilled the expectations of the board of 
regents. The kindergarten was at first used as a school of observation merely; but 
a few years later it was used, as the other model departments were used, as a school 
of practice; and it was found that the lessons learned in the kindergarten by the 
normal students gave them a much clearer insight into the underlying principles of 
all school work and helped to solye many vexatious problems in school management.

waukee at an expense of $53,000, were presented to the State in 1885, and the school 
was opened in September of that year. It is claimed as a great advantage to this 
school that it is situated in a great and growing city, in which there are large com- 
mercial and manufacturing industries, a public library of 60,000 volumes, an art 
museum, and a museum of natural history. Every school is largely controlled by its 
local environment, and one of the chief functions of this school is to take the place 
of a city training school. Accordingly, students are admitted from the high school, 
without examination, on presenting a certificate of having completed the first three 
years of one of the existing courses of study in the high school at Milwaukee. The 
regular normal course may be completed in two years, and comprises (a) a review of 
all the branches of study taught in the common schools; (b) a critical study of 
physics, chemistry, and natural history, with the methods of presenting these sub- 
jects in the schoolroom; (c) a course in English language and literature, history of 
the United States, civil government, and political economy; (d) a course in school 
management, history of education, science of education, and psychology. Every 
student is required to spend at least forty weeks teaching in the model school under 
the supervision and direction of the training teacher, but no one is permitted to 
begin the work of teaching until he has studied psychology. 
The following is a syllabus of the lessons on the ‘‘ Elements of political economy,” 
mentioned in (¢) above: 
ELEMENTS OF POLITICAL ECONOMY. 
1. Fundamental notions of value, wealth, labor and capital. The three forces or 
factors that enter into the production of wealth. Advantages, disadvantages, and 
limitations of division of labor. 
2. The mechanism of exchange: Various forms of currency. Banking functions. 
Bimetalism. Some common errors in regard to money. Regulation of production 
and exchange by legislative enactment, and popular fallacies respecting the same. 
Nature and cause of panics. 
3. Distribution of profits: Rent, interest, natural and legal rate, usury laws, profits 
on capital and on business. Wages, real and nominal, of skilled and unskilled 
labor; of men and women. The “‘wage-fund”’ doctrine. Cooperative societies. 
Trades unions and strikes. Principles and methods of taxation. Revenue of the 
oe, and of the United States. 
The use of wealth: Productive and unproductive consumption. Economic 
danineives of luxury. Subsistence and population. 
Debates upon topics pertaining to this study encouraged, and students led to read 
both sides of disputed questions. Text: Laughlin, Walker. 
It is to be regretted that the catalogue from which this admirable syllabus is taken 
contains in its ‘‘ Arrangement of Studies’’ no notice of the place or time it occupies 
in the school work.! 
MINNESOTA. 
Srate Normayt Scuoor, Winona. 
Near the close of the session of the first legislature of the State, August 2, 1858, an 
act was passed preparing for the establishment of three normal schools. This legis- 
lation was suggested by Dr. John D. Ford, of Winona, and secured by his efforts 
through the legislative delegation from Winona County. At the first meeting of the 
State normal board of directors it was resolved, ‘‘That the first normal school be 
located at Winona, provided the subse: ee from Winona of $7,000 be Sy

secured to the uses of said school.’’ This was at that time the only State normal 
school west of the Mississippi. 
On the evening of the Sth of November, Lieutenant-Governor Holeombe, president 
of the board of directors, delivered an address on the subject, ‘‘Education with 
reference to the establishment of the first normal school of Minnesota,’”’ which is 
said to have done much to elevate, if not to create, that sentiment of earnest support 
of educational interests which has marked the history of the city of Winona. 
In the first annual report of the normal board to the governor the claims of the 
school to generous support and its vital relation to the common schools of the State 
were set forth in a clear and forcible manner. The board also urged in this report 
that ‘‘a competent superintendent of public instruction be appointed;’’ that “‘a gen- 
eral supervision of the subjects of schools, school-teaching, and school lands is abso- 
lutely necessary,’ and that ‘‘the school lands should be put into a condition to realize 
the largest possible annual fund.” To the credit of this normal board and its secre- 
tary, Dr. Ford, it may be said that the first State tax for school purposes was author- 
ized and levied upon their urgent recommendation. 
An appropriation of $5,000 having been secured, it was decided to open the school 
on the first Monday in September, 1860. Prof. John Ogden, of Columbus, Ohio, was 
elected principal at a salary of $1,400. In his inaugural address, Professor Ogden 
said: 
It shall be the leading object of the normal school so to distribute its labors and 
other exercises that all the faculties of the pupil, payee, intellectual, moral, and 
spiritual, shall be addressed in due proportion, at the prober time and in the proper 
manner; and so to develop, strengthen, elevate, and purify these powers in the stu- 
dent and so train him in the educational processes that he may readily apply them 
to the education of the children and youth committed to his care. More pains shall 
be taken to make teachers than mere scholars, well knowing this to be the point upon 
which normal schools fail more frequently than upon any other. Here, then, fellow- 
teachers and friends, in this brief outline, behold my ideal of a school. Behold my 
type of a national education. Behold what your schools ought to be, and every school 
must be, if we ever expect to meet a tithe of that weighty obligation resting upon 
us, the public servants of this great and growing Commonwealth. 
  At the session of the legislature in 1861 a special act was passed creating the first 
board of education of Winona. This board was to consist of one school director 
from each ward of the city, with the principal of the normal school and such mem- 
bers of the normal board as were residents of the city. The idea was to copy some- 
what after the Oswego plan of uniting the jurisdiction of the normal and the public 
schools of Winona, and using the public schools as graded and model schools; but in 
the following year this law was repealed and the joint jurisdiction ceased. 
Professor Ogden resigned the principalship of the school in December, 1861, for the 
purpose of entering the Union Army. In his letter of resignation he said: 
My distracted and dishonored country calls louder for my poor service just now 
than the ool does. * * * My brethren and fellow-teachers are in the field. 
Some of them, the bravest and the best, have already fallen. Their blood will do 
more to cleanse this nation than their teaching would. So will mine. I feel 
ashamed to tarry longer. 
The school was continued for another term under a temporary principal and was 
then suspended until November, 1864. The reasons for this suspension were: 
(1) The interest in the great struggle then pending overshadowed everything else; 
(2) competent teachers could not be found to take charge of the school; such men 
were generally in the war; (3) the means for the support of the school were inade- 
quate—the State had made no appropriations beyond the first $5,000; (4) the State 
was too busy in the war to care for its educational interests. 
During the session of the legislature.in the spring of 1864, at the earnest solicitation 
of the citizens of Winona, an act was passed renewing the appropriations to the 
school and reestablishing it on a permanent basis. This act provided that the sum 
     
-P-A-G-E-1141
  
NORMAL SCHOOLS IN THE UNITED STATES. 2381 
of $3,000 be appropriated for the current year, $4,000 for the following year, and 
$5,000 annually thereafter. No movement, however, was made to reopen the school 
until the following September, when Prof. William F. Phelps, formerly principal of 
the State Normal School of New Jersey, was elected principal, and entered 
immediately upon the duties of his office. His rare ability as an organizer and dis- 
ciplinarian was at once apparent in the prompt and efficient measures taken to reestab- 
lish the school and to raise it to the high standard which it subsequently attained. 
The following extract from: his first annual report indicates the policy of the school 
under the administration of twelve years which followed the reopening: 
The normal school aims to educate and train teachers to a proper conception of the 
principles and to a skillful execution of the pectic of their difficult art. It seeks to 
impart to them an accurate knowledge of those subjects which they are required to 
teach, that they may teach with intelligence and taste. It must, moreover, labor to 
develop in them all those excellences of character which will make them fit exam- 
ples to those who are to be brought under their influence and molded into intelligent 
and virtuous citizens. It must thoroughly imbue them with a love for their work. 
It must generate in them the true esprit de corps. It must make them acquainted 
as far as possible with those multifarious and complicated processes which are best 
calculated to draw out the faculties of the young and bring their threefold natures 
into harmonious and healthful activity. In fine, the normal school should inspire 
its pupils with those comprehensive views of education which should shape all their 
measures and methods, and thus enable them, by an intelligent and judicious adapta- 
tion of means, to aim directly at the development of all that pertains to a noble and 
symmetrical manhood and womanhood. 
Up to this time the school had been held in one of the city buildings (now the 
Winona library building), the use of which was given without cost — another evi- 
dence of the friendliness of the citizens to this struggling institution. The legislature 
of 1866 made the first appropriation of $10,000 for a school building. The whole of 
this sum was used in constructing a foundation, an important measure which com- 
mitted the State fully to the completion of the building. The corner stone was laid 
on the 19th of October, 1866. In the spring of 1867 an appropriation from the leg- 
islature of $50,000 was secured for building purposes, and the building was occupied 
by the school in September, 1869, though not completed till the following December. 
It is acknowledged to be, even at this date (1892), one of the most nearly perfect 
buildings of the kind in the Northwest. Its admirable adaptation to the existing and 
prospective wants of the school and its nearly faultiess construction are largely due 
to the experienced judgment and wise forethought of the principal. 
The growth of the school in numbers, in reputation, and in-all the characteristics 
of an excellent training school continued without marked interruption until 1876, 
when the legislature failed to make the usual annual appropriation for the support 
of the three normal schools of the State. The normal board was called in extra 
session, and several propositions to close the schools at once were voted down by a 
bare majority. The opposition to these proposals was led by the Hon. Thomas 
Simpson, the resident director at Winona. Finally the board took action, which 
was intended merely to give the schools a chance for continuance if they could find 
any means of existing without involving the board or incurring a debt. The resi- 
dent director at Winona determined that the school should not go down. He made 
a temporary reduction of the teaching force, some abatements of salaries, and some 
extra charges for tuition. By these means the school was kept in vigorous operation 
until the following year, when the appropriation was not only restored but was made 
permanent. The action at Winona had much to do with inspiring a like spirit and 
determination on the part of the local management of the schools at Mankato and 
St. Cloud. 
During the summer of 1876 Principal Phelps resigned to accept the presidency of 
the State Normal School at Whitewater, Wis., and Prof. Charles E. Morey was elected 
to the principalship, which he held until his resignation in 1879.   
 
-P-A-G-E-1142
    
2382 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
Principal Morey made an important change in the organization of the school by 
extending the elementary course; establishing an advanced four-years’ course of 
study (designed to prepare teachers for the principalship of high and graded schools), 
and a professional course of one year for graduates of high schools and colleges. 
On the resignation of Mr. Morey, Prof. Irwin Shepard, the present incumbent 
(1892), was elected president, and since that time the growth of the school in num- 
bers, efficiency, and popularity has continued without interruption. The first 
teachers’ institute in the State, in 1859; the first State convention of county super- 
intendents, in 1866; and the first institute of normal instructors, in 1872, were all 
held at the Winona Normal School. 
The first class which finished the course of this school numbered 16 members, and 
was graduated in June, 1860, Since that date 34 classes, numbering about 1,000 
members, have been graduated, and nearly 6,000 other students received instruction 
for one or more terms. These students, as well as the graduates, have fulfilled their 
pledges to the State with fidelity and success. 
The school was the first in the West to follow the example of Massachusetts in 
introducing industrial drawing as an essential part of the course. The laboratory 
methods of studying the natural sciences have always been followed, and from the 
very first objective teaching took the place of memoriter recitations. In 1880 a kin- 
dergarten and a kindergarten training department were organized. 
In 1871 an association was formed for the promotion of the knowledge of art, sci- 
ence, and literature, in which the residents of the city cooperated with the authori- 
ties of the normal school. The plans of the society provided for “the fitting of 
rooms in the first State normal school building for a museum of natural history and 
physical science and for a department of drawing and the arts of design; the collec- 
tion, classification, and arrangement of specimens in natural history and archeology, 
and of models in physics and the fine arts; the collection of facts and objects per- 
taining to local or general history; the establishment and support, on the grounds of 
the normal school, of a botanical garden; the arrangement and ornamentation of the 
grounds; the gathering of a library of standard works in all departments of science, 
literature, and art; the preservation of all collections; and the elevation of the public 
taste by lectures and other appropriate means.”’ 
Previous to the organization of this society citizens of Winona had placed in the 
normal school building for the use of the students private collections of minerals and 
other specimens. The proprietorship of these collections was vested in the new 
society. The collections were increased from time to time by additional contribu- 
tions, and were arranged in the geological hall of the normal building in 1878, 
The museum has now become one of the most extensive in the West. The principal 
sections are, (1) numismatics, (2) archzeology and ethnology, (3) mineralogy, (4) 
geology and paleontology, (5) zoology. 
Two spacious rooms in the fourth story are devoted to the exhibition of art sub- 
jects —autotypes from the old masters, many fine engravings and paintings, and a 
small collection of busts, casts, and models.

On the 6th of October, 1868, there were gathered in the vestry of the Methodist 
Episcopal Church at Mankato, Minn., 27 young people who had presented themselves 
in response to notices given at teachers’ institutes to enter the second State Normal 
School of Minnesota. The school was then and there organized under the principal- 
ship of Prof. George M. Gage. Actual work was begun the next day and for some 
time the daily sessions of the school were held in the vestry, while a brick building 
for its use was being erected by Mr. John J. Shaubut. From day to day the attend- 
ance increased, and when the school took up its abode in Mr. Shaubut’s building 
’

the normal class numbered upward of 40. The State normal board had been noti- 
fied at its meeting in June, 1868, that the citizens of Mankato had complied with 
the law relating to the establishment of normal schools, and $5,000 were deposited 
with the treasurer of the prudential committee. The committee selected and pur- 
chased the present site, and erected in 1869 a building which for several years fur- 
nished ample room for the growing school. In 1873 Professor Gage was succeeded 
as principal by Miss Julia A. Sears, who held that position for one year and was 
followed by Dr. D. C. John. In 1880 Prof. Edward Searing became the principal, 
afterwards styled president, and has since continued at the head of the school. Its 
growth was steady and continuous, from 27 pupils to over 600, including a model 
school of 239, and from 3 teachers to 13. 
The chief purpose of the school is special instruction in the science and art of 
teaching, but, as in nearly all other normal schools in the country, a thorough sys- 
tem of academic instruction is at once the basis and, to a large extent the medium 
of professional instruction. Few pupils come with sufficient attainments and intel- 
lectual discipline to qualify them for immediate entrance upon a purely professional 
course of instruction. In the normal department there are two courses of study, 
one of three years, called the elementary course, and one of four years, known as 
the advanced course. The studies of the two courses are identical for the first two 
years, and correspond almost exactly to those of the State Normal School at St. 
Cloud, given below. 
The number of normal mace according to the last catalogue, was 305.1 
Starz Normat Scroot, Sr. Croup. 
This school was opened in September, 1869, in the hotel building known as the 
Stearns House, where it was conducted until the completion of the present build- 
ing in 1875. The old building has since that time been used asa ladies’ home. The 
object of the school is to train teachers for the public schools of the State, and no 
effort is made to secure students for the academic course alone, for, while such are 
admitted as ‘‘tuition students,” they simply share in the education expressly pro- 
vided for those who are to become teachers. 
There are two courses of study—the elementary and the advanced. The elemen- 
tary course comprises three years, the advanced course four years. It is the settled 
policy of the school to raise its standard of admission from year to year until the time 
shall come when all students can devote themselves wholly to professional work.

PROFESSIONAL COURSE. 
Methods, psychology, history and science of education, school economy, practice, 
elemental principles of and methods in arithmetic, grammar, geography, and read- 
ing; drawing. 
Exercises in vocal music, elocution, essay writing, and spelling are maintained 
. throughout these courses of study. 
| The professional course is intended especially for graduates of high schools and 
colleges. It consists of the strictly pedagogical branches, with practice teaching and 
| a review of the elementary subjects from the teaching point of view. 
| In the regular course a full half year is given to the subject of detailed methods of 
instruction in the branches which involve the elements of knowledge. These 
“‘methods”’ are not empirical, but are the result of a careful application of the laws 
. of mind to the arrangement and grading of work, to the art of questioning, to the 
acquisitive and elaborative processes, and to the recitative or reproductive states of 
knowledge. Pedagogy is regarded as applied psychology. 
| A full half year is given to practice teaching in the model school. This work is 
done under the immediate supervision of a skilled teacher, who helps the student to 
apply the laws of mind in the actual work of the schoolroom. ‘It is thus not blind 
experimentation, trusting to luck that somehow the right way will at last be dis- 
covered or hit upon by experience, but it is scientific prevision and insight applied 
| to work. It is work with a conscious purpose, with the advantage of a preformed 
) ideal and a definite knowledge of its conditioning laws. It is no more blind than is 
the work of a Faraday or a Tyndall in natural science.” 
The school is well furnished with apparatus for work in physics, physiology, and 
chemistry, and a carefully selected cabinet for illustrations in geology, mineralogy, 
and natural history. Chemistry is taught by a combination of class work and 
laboratory practice. The student during the afternoon of each day performs all the 
experiments for himself in the laboratory; on the following morning, in the class- 
room, he reports upon his researches, and, aided by the teacher, text-book, and 
classmates, he corrects his judgments and prepares for the experimental work of the 
afternoon. 
The total number of students in the normal department (1890) is 195, 26 being in 
the advanced course and 169 in the elementary. The model department is divided 
into three grades, averaging about 40 each. The faculty consists of the president, 
Thomas J. Gray, and 13 professors and instructors.1

On the 6th of September, 1876, the State Normal School of Iowa was opened at 
Cedar Falls with an enrollment of 27 students At the end of the year the enroll- 
ment was 155; at the end of the second year, 237; at the end of the third year, 252; 
fourth year, 339; fifth year, 334; sixth year, 352; seventh year, 301. 
: The site and buildings, owned by the State and previously occupied as a soldiers’ 
| orphans’ home, were transferred to the normal school for its accommodation. It 
: was known at the time that the buildings were inadequate to the requirements of a 
| great school such as this was destined to be; but it is the beginning that costs, and 
here was at least a beginning. It is not surprising to learn that for many years the 
cry of the school was that of the horse-leech, ‘Give, give!”’ In the second biennial 
report the board of directors asked for a library and reading room, arcom fora museum 
and apparatus, a room for general assembly, a room for chapel, more rooms for recita- 
1 Catalogue of State Normal School, St. Cloud, Minn., for year ending June, 1890.

tions, and more rooms for dormitories. They asked also for an increased appropria- 
tion, because the school had doubled in size since it was organized, necessitating the 
employment of students to assist the overworked teachers, and because it was diffi- 
cult to obtain competent teachers at the salaries the board could afford to pay. In 
the third biennial report the same requests were repeated in almost the same words. 
In 1881 the board asked the general assembly for an appropriation of $30,000 for 
the construction of an additional normal building. The request was granted, and 
the new building was ready for occupation and was formally dedicated in June, 1883. 
The board expressed their gratitude, but reiterated their request for a larger appro- 
priation to enable them to pay the teachers better salaries—‘‘a sum sufficient to make 
their compensation equal to that paid for like services in similar institutions in 
adjoining States.’’ The board was well pleased with the new building. ‘‘It is three 
stories high and is furnished with all modern improvements. It contains a chapel, 
a model school room, a library, two society halls, chemical and physical laboratories, 
offices, cloakrooms, music rooms, recitation rooms, and dormitories.’? But while 
acknowledging the obligation, the legislature is gently reminded that increased 
accommodations will bring in an increased number of students, and an increase of 
students necessitates an increase of teachers, and an increase of teachers means an 
increased appropriation for current expenses. 
The sixth biennial report keeps up the demand. The principal needs a residence, 
a cottage outside of the college walls within which he has been compelled to reside to 
the great discomfort of his family. The school needs a new dormitory to accommo- 
date not less than a hundred sleepers. It needs an addition to the library, for one-half 
of the books were the personal property of the retiring principal and retired with him. 
It needs a liberal appropriation for a chemical laboratory. It needs a new supply of 
pianos; ‘‘the board are certain that could the proper authorities overhear them they 
would quickly replace them with the best.’? (It isto be hoped that the ‘‘ proper au- 
thorities’’ were spared the infliction.) Next to music comes cleanliness. Theschool 
needs a laundry with modern appliances, for ‘‘washerwomen quit without notice, 
and the weather at times prevents drying.’’ The school being a mile and a half 
from the city, and the team in use being old (one horse, over 20 years), a new team 
and bus are indispensable. The main hall must have a new roof, the floors must 
be renewed or repaired, electric lights must be furnished, and for the supply of all 
these wants the board asks only an appropriation of $61,800. Most of the above- 
mentioned requests were granted by the legislature; but the seventh biennial report— 
the latest that the editor has seen—renews the application for a cottage for the presi- 
dent, for electric lighting, for an additional number of teachers, for more books in 
the library, and for additional apparatus for the illustration of the natural and phys- 
ical sciences. The estimate of expenses for the next two years is $62,100. 
The growth of this school in popularity, efficiency, and professional character has 
more than kept pace with the growth of its environment; it has been always ahead of 
the latter. Like an endogenous plant, it has grown from within. Every call for addi- 
tional external facilities has been preceded by a call from the living organism that 
admitted of no refusal. The school was opened in 1876, with five teachers: The prin- 
cipal in the chair of mental philosophy, moral philosophy, and didactics; a professor 
of ancient languages and natural science (though ancient languages do not appear in 
the printed curriculum); a professor of mathematics and English literature; a teacher 
of geography and history; and a professor of vocal and instrumental music. The 
students were arranged in two classes—senior elementary and junior elementary. In 
1879 two teachers were added: teacher of elocution, drawing, and accounts; and 
an assistant. In 1883 another teacher was added for natural science and as assistant 
in mathematics. In the same year the elementary course was discontinued, and the 
school became more decidedly professional, and next year the model school was 
opened. At this time the normal course was taught in three classes, each occupying 
ED 99—VOL Ir 150 
        
 
-P-A-G-E-1146
  2386 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
one year—senior didactic, middle didactic, and junior didactic, with a post-graduate 
didactic course attended by one student. The enrollment had now reached 408.in 
the normal and 68 in the model school. ‘‘ Careful count,’ says the principal in 
his report for this year, ‘‘justifies me in saying that 92 per cent of all whom we 
enroll enter upon the work of teaching.’”” The principa: also expresses his opinion 
’ that ‘‘the greater benefit derived by the State from the school is derived from the 
nongraduates and not from the graduates.’ The reason given is that there are nine 
times as many of them, and the limited preparation of the many will, in the aggre- 
gate, exceed in usefulness the extended preparation of the few. 
After ten years’ service the principal, J. C. Gilchrist, retired and Homer H. Seerley 
took his place with eight colleagues, the new chair being that of ‘‘methods.’’ There 
are now (1892) four courses of study open to those who are preparing for the profession 
of teaching: 
(1) The scientific course, of four years. 
(2) The didactic course, of three years. 
(3) The supplementary course for high-school graduates, of two years. 
(4) The professional course for college graduates, of one year.

in normal-school work. The career of this school has been traced more minutely 
and in greater detail than that of some others because it seemed typical of natural 
growth in accordance with the necessities of the environment.* 
MISSOURLI. 
Stare Norma Scnoon, KrrKsvi.ie. 
In 1870 the legislature of Missouri made provision for two State normal schools, 
one to be located north and one south of the Missouri River. The school for the 
first normal district was located at Kirksville, and opened as a State institution on the 
2d of January, 1871. Adair County voted $100,000 to secure the location of the 
school, with the understanding that the annual current expenses would be met by 
the State. The first annual State appropriation was for $5,000; the last (1890), for 
$12,500. 
Previous to the legislation which provided for the establishment and maintenance 
of the State normal schools, a private normal school had been conducted for three 
years and a half by Prof. J. Baldwin with such efficiency and popularity that it was 
adopted as the State normal school of the district without any change in the faculty 
or the course of study. The building is 180 by 90 feet and four stories high. With 
the grounds, furniture, apparatus, and library, the cost was $150,000. All the move- 
ments of the school are regulated by bells rung by an electric clock, the first clock 
of the kind ever used by any school for a similar purpose. 
There is no boarding hall or dormitory. Board in respectable private families costs 
from $2.50 to $3 a week. Tuition for the year costs $20, payable in four quarterly 
installments of $5 each. The work of this school is special. It does not offer a 
general, academic, college, preparatory, or seminary education. Those, and those 
only, are invited to attend who want to learn how to teach.” 
The means employed for the training of teachers are: 
(a) Thorough study by the students: They are expected to study their lessons 
and to become familiar with hard study. 
(b) Careful and critical recitation under the direction of the teacher: Students are 
expected to recite without assistance from the teachers. 
(c) The study of teaching: This includes three distinct courses of study. The first 
embraces the object, means, and methods of teaching; the motives of the teacher and 
the methods of organizing, conducting, and governing schools. The second treats of 
the methods of teaching the various branches of study. The third relates to the 
study of the mental and moral powers, their nature and culture.

NORMAL SCHOOLS IN THE UNITED STATES. 2389 
MODEL AND TRAINING SCHOOL. 
The model department was established in November, 1882, for the purpose of 
exhibiting the best methods of classification, teaching, and discipline, which the 
normal students could observe and take part in as instructors and afterwards imitate 
when they become teachers of public schools. Members of the graduating classes are 
required to teach under the careful criticism of experienced teachers, and no one is 
graduated or licensed to teach in the schools of the State who does not satisfactorily 
stand this test. Each day a meeting of the student teachers is held by the principal of 
the model school, when the criticisms of the day are read and discussed and the work 
for the next day arranged. This school of practice is necessarily a local school, com- 
posed almost entirely of small children. It was not established for the convenience 
of Kirksville, but because it was considered to be ‘‘just as necessary an instrument of 
anormal school asa library, laboratory, or gymnasium.’’ Several times a week classes 
from the model school are taught by members of the method classes of the nor- 
mal in the presence of the class, the principal of the model department, and other 
members of the faculty. At the close of the lesson the class is dismissed, and the 
method and manner of the teacher are freely and fully discussed by all present— 
faults pointed out and improvements suggested. The following ‘‘directions’’ are 
given to student teachers in the model school: 
A. Require and secure: (1) Good conduct in class room. (2) Quiet and orderly 
movements passing to and from class room. (3) Erect position of pupils. (4) 
Promptness and accuracy. (5) Neatness of blackboard work. 
B. (1) Make a careful preparation for each lesson, including both matter and 
method of the recitation. (2) Stand before the class. (3) Request rather than 
command, (4) Ask definite questions and give positive directions. (5) Show 
pupils how to study and how to recite. (6) Be energetic, thorough, firm, clear, and 
efficient. 
C. Cautions: Guard against much talking, dependence on the text-book, scolding, 
and fault-finding. 
D. Strive to secure: (1) Thorough study, clear recitation, a lively interest, close 
attention, rapid progress. (2) Use visible illustrations and illustrative objects as 
much as you can with profit. (3) Keep the recitation room in good order. 
Reading: Require pupils to sit and stand erect. (2) Have a short preliminary 
drill in yocal sounds, phonetic spelling, exercises in articulation, pitch, force, and 
rate. (3) Give frequent examples of good reading. (4) Require pupils to under- 
stand both the meaning of the words and the thought of the reading lesson. (5) 
Require pupils to read naturally and with pure tone. (6) Have variety in manner 
and method. (7) Let the pupils bring choice extracts from books, papers, and 
magazines and read them in class. 
Spelling: (1) Use the written spelling method. (2) Pronounce each word distinctly 
and but once. (3) Require the writing to be neat and plain. (4) Have missed. 
words rewritten at each lesson. (5) Review misspelled words daily. (6) Keepa 
list of missed words and use them at review. 
Geography: (1) Have a map before the class. (2) Have the pupils draw maps on 
the board. (3) Have the lesson written on the board by partsof the class. (4) Have 
the lesson recited by topics, and without questions. (5) Use the globe, objects, and

Srare Norman ScHoor, WARRENSBURG. 
This school was established in the spring of 1871 in pursuance of an act of the 
general assembly dividing the State into two normal-school districts, and authorizing

the establishment of one normal school in each district. After a sharp competition 
between different points, the school for the second district was located at Warrens- 
burg, in Johnson County. In order to secure this location, the, citizens of Johnson 
County voted $128,000 in county bonds, the citizens of Warrensburg voted $45,000 in. 
city bonds, and private citizens donated a campus of 16 acres within the city limits, 
valued at $8,000, making the original cost to citizens of county and town $181,000. 
The first session of fourteen weeks closed on the 18th of August, 1871, with an 
enrollment of 87 students. The last catalogue (July, 1892) shows an attendance of 
874 students in the normal department, 341 men and 533 women. 
Applicants for admission must be at least 16 years of age, present satisfactory 
evidence of good moral character, and pass a satisfactory examination in spelling, 
reading, descriptive geography, English grammar, United States history, and arith- 
metic to percentage. They must also execute in good faith a declaration to teach 
school in the State of Missouri. 
The course of study consists of four years. The first two years constitute the 
elementary section; the last two the advanced section. Students completing the 
work of the elementary section receive a ‘‘certificate of graduation,’ which is valid 
as a State certificate for two years. Those who complete the advanced course receive 
a diploma with the degree of “bachelor of scientific didactics,’’ which is equivalent 
to a State certificate for life. 
Like other normal schools the school at Warrensburg has had to fight its way to 
popular recognition. It was charged with being only a local institution, and there- 
fore undeserving of State support. It was alleged that the graduates did not teach, 
and that they preferred to teach outside of the State. Even the practice depart- 
ments encountered strong opposition on the ground that the children of the town in 
the immediate vicinity of the school were receiving their education at the expense 
of the State. But these and other allegations of like character have been shown to 
be baseless, and the success of the school seems to be fully established, as it has 
certainly been deserved.

2394 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
Stare Normat Scnoor, Care GIRARDEAU. 
The State Normal School for the third district was established by an act of the 
legislature approved March 22, 1873. This act created a board of regents for the man- 
agement of the school, consisting of the State board of education and four regents 
appointed by the governor. There were several bids for the location, and the board 
selected Cape Girardeau. Pending the erection of a new building the school was 
opened in one of the public schoolhouses of the city. The new building is an elegant 
and substantial structure, four stories high, and sufficient for the accommodation of 
500 pupils. 
* The course of study, constructed with special regard to the preparation of teachers 
for common and high schools, is substantially the same in the three State normal 
schools, though each school makes a special adjustment for its (real or supposed) 
special needs. The full course occupies four years—three in the ‘‘elementary”’ and 
one in the ‘‘advance’’ course. Those who complete the elementary course receive a 
certificate which authorizes them to teach for two years in the public schools of the 
State. Graduates from the advance course receive a diploma attesting the degree 
“Bachelor of Scientific Didactics.’”” The ‘bachelors’? who teach successfully in the 
public schools in the State after receiving their diploma, and who complete a course 
of post-graduate reading prescribed by the board of regents, may be granted the 
degree of ‘Master of Scientific Didactics.’ The post-graduate course is comprised 
in four divisions—history, poetry, fiction, and professional, as follows: 
       First YEar.—History.—Prescott’s Conquest of Mexico, Lossing’s National History 
of the United States, Motley’s Dutch Republic, Hume’s England, Poetry.—Homer’s 
liad, Thompson’s Seasons, Pollock’s Course of Time, Coleridge’s Ancient Mariner. 
Fiction.—Scott’s W averley and Ivanhoe, Irving’s Knickerbocker History of New York, 
Dickens’s David Copperfield, Johnson’s Rasselas. Professional.—Holbrook’s Normal 
Methods, Tate’s Philosophy of Education, Northend’s Teacher and Parent, Porter’s 
Elements of Intellectual Science, Root’s School Amusements. 
Seconp YrAr.—ffistory.—Macaulay’s England, Guizot’s History of Civilization, 
Irving’s Life of Washington. Poetry.—Moore’s Lallah Rookh, Tennyson’s Harold, 
Longfellow’s Hiawatha and Evangeline. iction.—Henry James’s Portrait of a Lady, 
Howell’s Undiscovered Country, George Eliot’s Mill on the Floss, Goldsmith’s 
Vicar of Wakefield. Professional.—Fitch’s Lectures on Teaching, Gregory’s Christian 
Ethics, Barnard’s Object Teaching and Methods, Herbert Spencer on Education, 
Bain’s Logic, Quick’s Essays. 
From 1883 to 1889, inclusive, 26 graduates received the degree of master of scien- 
tific didactics, and between 1877 and 1890 (both inclusive) 95 received the degree of 
bachelor of scientific didactics. 
The enrollment of students the first year (1873-74) w —28 ladies and 29 gen- 
tlemen; for the last year (1889-90) , 361—164 ladies and 197 gentlemen. 
Tuition is free, but an ‘incidental fee’’ of $3 a term ($6 a year) is charged.

  TE NorMAL ScHooLt, EMporra. 
In the first month of the second year of her statehvod, Kansas laid the legislative 
foundations of three great institutions—the State University, the State Agricultural 
College, and the State Normal School. There were grave doubts of the ability of the 
State to make the necessary appropriation to start the normal school at an early 
day; but in 1864 the legislature passed an act appropriating $1,000 to the State 
Normal School to be used exclusively for the salaries of teachers. Prof. Lyman 
B. Kellogg was the first principal. In his report five years later, Principal Kel- 
logg says: ‘‘On the 15th day of February, 1865, 18 students (15 more than were
-P-A-G-E-1155

greeted by Father Peirce in Lexington, when the first normal school of Massachu- 
setts was opened, and 1 less than President Hovey had at the beginning of the Ili- 
nois University), were gathered in a room belonging to the district school of 
Emporia. With them there was one teacher. The 18 students had settees borrowed 
from a neighboring church. The teacher’s seat was a chair, borrowed from the 
county treasurer’s office. There was no teacher’s desk; there were no text-books, 
maps, or other appliances. The parable of ‘The Sower’ was read, the Lord’s 
Prayer repeated, and the normal school of Kansas was opened.”’ 
One room of the public schoolhouse of Emporia was occupied by the normal 
school during the first term. An assistant teacher being needed and no room being 
available, a citizen, whose children were attending the school, built a one-story 
frame building, 14 by 20, near the school and gave the use of it to the school without 
charging rent. : 
A new building for which the legislature had made an appropriation of $10,000 was 
oecupied by the school in January, 1867. The assembly room was capable of seating 
comfortably 120 pupils, and was the best audience room at that time in the city. 
The school, as usual with normal schools, outgrew its accommodations. In 1872 
the legislature appropriated the sum of $50,000 for the purpose of erecting a new 
normal-school building at Emporia, in addition to and connected with the building 
then occupied by the school. This appropriation was conditional on the city of 
Emporia contributing $10,000 to the same purpose. The condition was complied 
with and q handsome building erected, the dedication exercises being held in June, 
1878. 
In 1876, instead of the usual appropriation bills for salaries and other expenses of 
the State normal schools, the legislature introduced a section into the miscellaneous 
appropriation bill allotting several sums to each of the three normal schools to pay 
current expenses up to March, 1876, with the provision that these appropriations 
shall be received in full for all claims against the State, and that said schools cease 
to be maintained at the expense of the State; and the State shall not be liable for 
any expense in excess of this appropriation, and that the Leavenworth and Concor- 
dia normal schools cease to be State institutions. These two schools had been estab- 
lished under laws of 1870 and 1873, respectively. 
Being without funds to pay a faculty, the board discharged all the teachers with 
the exception of the president, Dr. Pomeroy, who was continued without salary to 
conduct the school. He was authorized to charge tuition fees and employ such 
teachers as he deemed necessary, but without expense to the board. Notwithstand- 
ing all these difficulties over 100 pupils were enrolled in the various departments 
during the year. The school was carried on for seven years on the tuition fees 
received from students and whatever money might be raised from the sale of normal 
lands. 
The building completed in 1873 was an unlucky one. The tornado of April, 1878, 
tore off nearly half the roof of the stone building, rolled up two-thirds of the tin 
roof of the other, and demolished several chimneys and windows. The rain went 
through the ceilings from roof to basement, loosening the plastering and damaging 
the furniture. 
The heating apparatus was very unsatisfactory, and yet on the morning of October 
26, 1878, the entire building was destroyed by fire. Nothing was saved of the normal 
property—library, museums, apparatus all perished, -with the library of the presi- 
dent and his household goods. 
During the week following the fire the citizens of Emporia at a public meeting 
declared in favor of early steps for the erection of a new building. The result of 
their earnest efforts was that the legislature appropriated $25,000 for the rebuilding 
of the State Normal School, provided that the city of Emporia and Lyon County
-P-A-G-E-1156
    
2396 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99, 
should contribute the sum of $20,800. The erection of the building occupied about 
a year, and the house was so near completion by May, 1880, that the school took 
possession on that day. 
There was no more room in this building than there had been in the other. 
Students continued to crowd in until the enrollment reached 746, three times the 
number that had been registered before the fire. 
In 1887 the legislature made an appropriation of $25,000 for the purpose of adding 
a wing to the building. The new building is a stately and beautiful edifice, admira- 
bly adapted to the purposes of the school. The main corridor is about 200 feet long, 
and the entire building contains 50 rooms. The rooms devoted to the kindergarten 
and the model school are furnished with all the modern appliances in the way of 
modeling boards, sand pans, number rods, reading boxes, balances, measures, charts, 
maps, geometrical forms, gifts, collections of the most common and most interesting 
minerals. The gymnasium is well supplied with apparatus for physical exercise. 
Besides wands, clubs, and dumb-bells for light gymnastics, there is suitable appara- 
tus for heavy gymnastics. From $1,000 to $1,500 a year are now appropriated for 
apparatus and museum.! 
Great attention seems to be paid to the physical condition of students, as would 
appear from the following blank:

The germ from which the Nebraska State Normal School sprung was the seminary 
at Peru, Nemeha County. The trustees offered the seminary building to the State 
for normal school purposes, and the legislature, in 1867, accepted the offer, estab- 
lished the State normal school at Peru, appropriated $3,000 to aid in fitting up the 
pbuilding, and assigned 20 sections of land as an endowment fund. A new building 
was erected in 1873, and enlarged in 1885. The seminary idea predominated at first. 
Tuition in the seminary was charged at $8 a term; in the normal department, $8; 
in the model school, $6; Latin, extra, $2. ‘‘Music on melodeon, $10; ornamental 
branches at usual rates.’’ State students, two from each State senatorial district, 
who signed a declaration to teach for three years in the public schools of the State, 
were admitted at half rates. 
But the normal idea finally prevailed, and the school is now purely professional,

and is free to all students properly qualified on paying $5 for matriculation fee and a 
contingent fee of $1 to cover breakage in the laboratories. There are two courses of 
study, the elementary and the higher. 
The elementary course, which embraces two full years of study, is designed to pre- 
pare teachers for common tngraded and lower grade schools, and hence, in addition 
to a critical study of all common branches, it comprises a thorough course of instruc- 
tion in the organization and management of ungraded schools, the methods of teach- 
ing the different branches, the art of rendering the elements of learning pleasant to 
the young, and the use of illustrative apparatus for primary schools. 
The higher course is designed to furnish students wishing to become strictly pro- 
fessional teachers such education and training as will thoroughly qualify them for the 
discharge of the duties of any educational position in which they may be called to 
labor; and hence, in addition to the elementary course, it comprises a three years’ 
course in the higher branches, including professional instruction in the laws ef men- 
tal development with their application to teaching; the science, philosophy, and his- 
tory of education; school laws in general, and the school system of N2braska in 
particular; and school gradation, supervision, and management. 
Each year is divided into three terms. The figures indicate the number of terms 
given to the several studies in the year. It is to be regretted that no intimation can 
be given of the number and length of the weekly recitations.

‘Vocal music, penmanship, and orthography are daily exercises, and constitute part 
of the regular course. Laboratory practice is required of all students in the higher 
course. 
During the year 1891 there were 454 students in attendance, including 95 students 
in the practice school who were admitted without matriculation, and whose names 
do not appear in the catalogue. Of these, 12 graduated from the higher and 48 from 
from the elementary course. 
The faculty consists of the principal, George L. Farnham, A. M., and twelve pro- 
fessors and instructors. 
The annual appropriation from the State is $17,550."

The State Normal School was located at Madison during the session of the legisla- 
ture of 1881-82, the citizens of Madison agreeing to donate to the Territory one 
quarter section of land 1 mile from the city limits as a site for school buildings. The 
location being thought too far from town, a lot of 20 acres within the city was chosen 
and work upon the building commenced in the spring of 1884. In the meantime 
the normal school had been opened in 1883, with 11 pupils. The second year closed 
with 42 pupils on the register. The legislature of 1884-85 having made an appro- 
priation of $13,600 for finishing the building and $14,000 for running expenses for 
two years, the school moved into the new building on the 2d of November. On the 
4th of February following the building was entirely destroyed by fire. Before the

fire was extinguished the board of education called a meeting. Accommodations 
were secured in the opera house, the Methodist Church, and the Baptist Church. 
Next morning the school went on as usual. Nota recitation was lost. On the 6th 
of March the citizens of Dakota yoted to raise $25,000 to rebuild the normal school- 
house and finish the dormitory. The corner stone of the new building was laid on 
the 20th of July. It is a massive structure of granite and is the handsomest build- 
ing of its size in the State. It is thoroughly ventilated and well warmed by steam. 
The act establishing this normal school provides that its ‘‘exclusive purpose shall 
be the instruction of persons, both male and female, in all the various branches that 
pertain to a good common-school education; also, to give instruction in the mechan- 
ical arts, in agriculture, in chemistry, in the fundamental laws of the United States, 
and in what regards the rights of citizens.” Candidates for admission must be 14 
years of age, of good moral character, and well yersed in the common-school studies. 
It is stated in the last annual catalogue that the sole design of the school is to edu- 
cate and train competent teachers for the public schools of the State; that all studies 
are selected for their pedagogical value, that there are no optional studies, and all 
the professional studies, the methods, and practice work must be actually taken. 
The following is the programme of daily recitations for the fall term of 1892:

Each student in the normal school, who is a citizen of the State, pays $12 a year 
for tuition, and nonresidents of the State pay $30 a year. Board and furnished 
rooms in the city of Madison cost from $2.50 to $3.25 per week. The cost in the dor- 
mitory, which is exclusively for ladies, is only $2.35 per week. 
The model school is a graded school of eight years, in which students from 
the normal department are required to put their methods and principles into 
practice, with the aid of critic teachers, who plan the subjects and supervise their 
daily work. The aim of the faculty is to make the model school the best elementary 
school in the State. 
The average daily attendance in 1889-90 was 118; in 1890-91, 122, and the same in 
1891-92. The number of first-year students on the last register was 125; second 
year, 33; third year, 22.1

The trustees of the Peabody fund, being convinced by an actual examination of 
the facts, as well as by the logical conditions of the question, that the greatest want 
of the South was a supply of trained teachers, authorized their agent, Dr. Barnas

Sears, to establish and foster normal schools. The State of Tennessee seemed to 
him to offer many advantages as an ‘‘ experimental station.’’. Accordingly he came 
to Nashville in 1873 and proposed to contribute from the Peabody fund $6,000 a year 
for the support of a normal school if the State legislature would appropriate a like 
sum. A bill for this purpose was introduced into the senate. It passed three read- 
ings in the senate, and would have passed the third reading in the house had the 
session lasted two days longer. 
A bill of the same purport was introduced into the next legislature and was 
defeated on its first reading. The State was not in condition to make an appropria- 
tion of $6,000 in addition to other and more imperative claims. The bill was 
amended by leaving out the appropriation clause and passed without difficulty. 
It was under this act that the normal school was established. _The State board had 
neither money nor buildings, but the trustees of the University of Nashville came 
forward and tendered the use of their building and grounds; and so under the 
auspices and by the mutual cooperation of three boards—the State board of educa- 
tion, the university trustees, and the trustees of the Peabody fund—the Peabody 
Normal College was opened on the 15th of September, 1875, with Dr. Eben S§. 
Stearns, chancellor of the University of Nashville, as president and two lady teach- 
ers as assistants.' At first there were only 13 students enrolled, but the school 
grew steadily and in 1887 numbered 177 students. After the death of Dr. Stearns, 
in 1887, Dr. William H. Payne, of the University of Michigan, was elected to the 
presidency. The school has an annual appropriation of $10,000 from the State, 
which was first given in 1881; the other expenses are met by the Peabody board of 
trust and the University of Nashville. For a few years after the opening of the 
college it received $3,000 annually from the Peabody fund, and in October, 1876, 
Dr. Sears, the general agent, announced that a limited number of scholarships, worth 
$200 each, would be given under certain conditions. Next year, 19 students from 
various States took advantage of this offer, and the number increased gradually until 
it reached 114. Tennessee had no Peabody scholarships until 1883; but as early as 
1880 the legislature had established 25 scholarships of $100 each for the students of 
that State. The Peabody scholarships are distributed at present (1892) as follows: 
Alabama, 13; Arkansas, 10; Georgia, 14; Louisiana, 8; North Carolina, 14; South 
Carolina, 10; Tennessee, 14; Texas, 9; Virginia, 14; West Virginia, 8. They are 
awarded on competitive examination by the respective State superintendents upon a 
uniform set of questions prepared by the president of the college and sent to the State 
superintendents. Applicants are required to be not less than 17 years of age nor more 
than 30; of irreproachable moral character; in good health, with no physical defects, 
habits, or eccentricities which would interfere with success in teaching, and have a 
purpose to follow teaching as a vocation. The minimum literary qualifications for 
securing a scholarship are the following: The ability to read fluently, to spell cor- 
rectly, and to express thoughts in grammatical English; to solye problems of moderate 
difficulty under all the ordinary rules of arithmetic, and to demonstrate any ordinary 
arithmetical principle; to locate the principal cities, rivers, and mountainsof the world, 
and to give the boundaries of any specified State of the Union; to parse the words of 
any ordinary English sentence, and to correct ungrammatical English; to solve equa- 
tions with two unknown quantities, and to describe the leading events in the history 
* of the United States. It is expected that the standard for entrance will be raised 
from year to year. For the year 1891-92 scholarship students are advised to come 
with one year’s preparation in Latin, A scholarship is good for any two successive 
years above the freshman class.

course should be in one and the same branch of study. 
The college degree proper is that of licentiate of instruction. To obtain this degrée 
the student must complete 18 full courses, of which the following are prescribed:

Froni the other courses offered the student must choose and complete enough to 
make in all 18 full courses. 
Scholarship students are credited on entrance with 5 full courses, and students 
have the privilege of being examined for advanced standing in any prescribed study 
if application is made within two weeks after entrance. If the examination is satis- 
factory credit is given for the study thus passed. 
The main purpose of this college is the professional education of teachers for the 
more responsible positions in the public-school service of the South. In its academic 
work it aims to give its students a liberal education of the collegiate type, and to 
impart to them an appreciable measure of the scholarly spirit. But while a gener- 
ous scholarship is indispensable to high excellence in teaching, the Peabody College 
recognizes that a teacher must be something more than a scholar. He must add to 
his general scholarship a comprehensive knowledge of educational doctrine, history, 
and methods; and this constitutes the professional work of the college. It is intended 
that this professional instruction shall be a characteristic feature of the college and 
that it shall be of a higher grade than has hitherto been given in any institution in 
the South.' :

The aim, purpose, and tendencies of this great normal school can not be thor- 
oughly understood without reference to the views of the celebrated educator now at 
the head of the institution. Referring to the peating of anormal school upon the 
ancient stock of the University of Nashville, Dr. Payne said in his inaugural address: 
The transformation of the literary department of this university into a normal 
college, while at first sight an innovation in scholastic history, is really a return to 
the primitive purpose of university organ cats In its origin and purpose the 
ancient university was a corporation of student teachers—of young men who sought 
the very highest intellectual culture of the time in order that they might become the 
teachers of the ignorant. A necessary condition imposed for obtaining the bachelor’s 
degree was that the candidate should have taught previous to his graduation, and the 
condition on which the master’s degree was subsequently granted was the express 
obligation to teach a certain number of years|after graduation. Even to-day we 
hear: an English educator of high rank asserting ti at the “true function of universities 
is to teach and to supply the world with teachers.” To what nobler use, then, could 
this venerable university be converted than to the preparation of young men and 
women for the higher and more responsible places in the public-school service. 
* * * There is no better place than this to reaffirm a truth that is in danger of 
being forgotten, that the primary and fundamental qualification for teaching is gen- 
erous scholarship, a confirmed love for the scholarly vocation, a high degree of intel- | 
lectual training. * * * So far as my knowledge goes, this is the only normal 
school in this country which proposes to make its academic work of collegiate grade, 
and it is in such a school, placing before it such an aim, that I can most heartily 
labor. Normal schools of the ordinary type, with an academic course ot the sec- 
ondary or high school grade, have their manifest place and function, and should be 
established and liberally sustained in every State, but these will never suffice to give 
proper tone and inspiration to public education. For this necessary purpose there 
must be schools wh intellectual training is of the collegiate or university type. 
In this institution the middle, senior, and baccalaureate classes represent the higher 
aims to which I refer, while the junior class constitutes the normal school as distin- 
guished from the normal college. 
But academic work of a high grade does not of itself constitute a normal college. 
This isa distinctly professional school in its constitution and purpose, and so the 
instruction it offers must be in part professional. The teacher must be a scholar and 
something more—more by that special kind of knowledge which fits him for his spe- 
aie duties. This special knowledge is the theory, the history, and the art of 
education. 
            
    
These sentiments of Dr. Payne are reiterated and emphasized in his baccalaureate 
address of May, 1890: 
The teaching profession is composed of two very unequal classes: the few who are 
Jeaders in educational opinion, and, compared with them, the almost innumerable 
host of teachers who carry into effect the plans and orders of their superiors. All 
well-coneeived plans for the education of teachers must take this distinction into 
practical account, and there must be two classes of professional schools based on these 
two orders of endowment and duty; there must be a few West Points for educating 
the commissioned officers of the great army of teachers, and a much larger number 
of subordinate schools for the dissemination of ‘‘true opinion,’’ for teaching subjects 
and methods to the rank and file of that mighty host of men and women who are the 
world’s teachers. It is not conceivable that the entire teaching class can ever be 
inspired by the scientific or the professional spirit—that spirit which animates the 
discoverer and sets him apart for life service in the schoolroom. * * *. I merely 
state a fact, and I state it in the mildest way, when I say that university and college 
men have but little respect for the scholarship that is produced in normal schools. 
This lack of respect does not proceed from rivalry, for any real rivalry between 
schools of such radically different grades is wholly out of the question. I think the 
feeling is caused for the most part by the assumption on the part of pormal school 
students of scholarship and learning which they do not have. * * 
Normal schools profess to do work which their rank and sicsenacsits make it 
impossible for them to do; their graduates are in some sort compelled to assume a 
competence which they do not have; and so they forfeit the respect of men who 
are really scholarly. I wish to say explicitly that so far as intent goes, the only fault 
that can ee be attributed to the State see schools @ the May, on the score 
  erie eaites at the inauguration of William H. Paya ne as chancellor of the unis 
ville and as president of the Normal College, Nashville, Tenn., October 5, 1887.      
“i Nash-

named is that they are overambitious. Without exception, so far as I know, these 
schools are administered by men whose good intent and honesty of purpose are 
beyond the slightest question. * * * But there are other so-called “normal 
schools or normal colleges’’ of whose honesty of purpose I can not speak with so much 
confidence. They are merely academies labeled with the trade-mark, ‘‘normal,’”’ 
and their advertised excellence consists in their being more than the equivalents of 
the ‘‘old-time’’ colleges and universities. In other words, they propose to do in two 
years what Harvard and Yale attempt todoinfour. In these ‘tindependent”’ schools 
the word ‘‘normal’’ connotesa mode of diagramming a sentence, a short cut to amas- 
tery of Latin, or some mere mannerism in teaching. _ Sigs 
T have assumed that in its rank, organization, and aim this institution belongs to 
the smaller and higher class of schools whose function is the education of men and 
women for the more commanding places in the public-school service of the country. 
* * * Tt is not the province of this college to duplicate any normal school of the 
existing type.! 
The Peabody board of trust has lately made an appropriation of $12,000 for a 
model school building, and this school is now in successful operation. It is a school 
of primary grade containing 40 children, from 6 to 10 years of age, taught by the 
most approved modern methods. It is a school of ‘‘observation’’ merely, in which 
students can study the work done by accomplished teachers; not an experimental 
school, ‘‘where children are to be practiced on by novices.” 
There is now in the South a demand for men who are competent to act as city and 
county superintendents, and one of the functions of the Peabody College is to train 
men for this useful and honorable career. Ample opportunities are presented for 
thorough instruction in scientific school supervision. 
A commodious gymnasium has been erected and furnished with the most approved 
apparatus. Besides the general exercises, in which all are expected to participate, 
unless for good reason excused, special exercises are prescribed for individual cases, 
based on a careful diagnosis of each student’s physical condition. The gymnasium 
also furnishes a pleasant diversion from study, and gives recreation of mind as well 
as exercise of muscle.” 
           
  ALABAMA. 
Srate Norman CoLiecr, Florence. 
The Alabama State Normal College was established in 1873 as the ‘‘State Normal 
School”’ with an annual State appropriation of $5,000. In1881 the State appropriation 
was increased to $7,500 per annum. In 1887 the board of directors was delocalized, 
no two members being appointed from the same county, and the name was changed 
to ‘“‘Alabama State Normal College.’’ Prior to 1886 the course of study was largely 
academie, little attention being paid to professional instruction. This was in part 
due to the fact that such instruction was best adapted to the students in attendance. 
Even as late as 1891 we are told: 
The experience of all [?] normal schools is that they must do academic work. 
Teachers, consciously or unconsciously, imitate their instructors. This is especially 
true if they have been educated in schools where no particular attention is paid to 
methods of imparting knowledge. They come forth with no awakened thought upon 
the importance of correct methods, and with all their attention fixed upon the matter 
to be taught; consequently they repeat what they have seen, both as to the art of 
instruction and the management of the school. Many of the schools from which the 
normal college is supplied with students can not send forth those who are thoroughly 
prepared in the various branches of study, while not one in twenty of the teachers 
in these schools has had any special training for his work. Theoretically it may be 
desirable to confine the work of the normal college to strictly professional subjects, 
but practically it is not as yet possible. 
Since 1886 more attention has been given to the professional training of teachers, 
and such instruction is now the leading feature of the institution.

There are in the same building two distinct schools, each with its own organiza- 
tion, the State Normal College and a Model Training School. The president and 
critic of the former are, respectively, superintendent and principal of the latter. 
This arrangement is mutually advantageous; it affords for pupil teachers of the nor- 
mal college a field for observation and practice in teaching, and it secures to children 
in the model school better instruction than they would otherwise be likely to have. 
The course in pedagogics proper covers a period of three years. The work of the 
second year is largely practice work; in the third and fourth years practice and theory 
are combined. In the second year the aim is to teach pupils to prepare and give 
lessons as regards matter, method, and manner. The lessons are written, submitted 
to the teacher for correction, and given to classmates, who endeavor to act the part 
of the pupils for whom the lesson is intended and who afterwards present criticisms 
to be reviewed by the teacher. In the third year the philosophy of methods is 
discussed. 
There are two courses, the advanced and the professional. The advanced, or 
regular course, occupies four years. The professional course requires but one year 
and is intended for teachers of experience and graduates of high schools and colleges 
who do not wish to take the regular course, partly because it traverses a large field 
with which they are already acquainted, and partly because they do not wish to 
be placed in the same ‘“‘form’’ with boys and girls of 15, the minimum age for 
admission. In the following table the right-hand column is the professional course; 
the advanced course includes the whole:

To students not less than 15 years of age who take the required course of study and 
pledge themselves to teach for two years in the public schools of Alabama, tuition is 
free; to others it is $6 for each term of twelve weeks in the Model Training School, 
and $8 for each term of the same length in the Normal College. Each student, how- 
ever, is required to pay an incidental fee of $2 at the beginning of each term. Board- 
ing in pleasant private families can be had at from $10 to $13a month, The number 
of students in attendance in the normal department in the session of 1890-91 was 218. 
  Srare Norman Scnoor, Troy, 
The legislature of Alabama, in 1887, authorized the establishment of a State normal 
school at Troy on the condition that the city should furnish grounds and buildings 
adapted to the requirements of the school. The city complied with this condition 
at an expense of $25,000 and the school was opened in 1888. The State appropria- 
tion of $3,000 was found to be entirely inadequate, but was supplemented by $1,200 
from the Peabody fund and’ by tuition fees averaging over $2,000. Students who 
take the legal obligation to teach two years in Alabama are free of tuition, with the 
exception of an incidental fee of $3 a term. Those who enter for general education 
only are charged $30 a year. 
Like many of the Northern schools, the school at Troy has had to fight its way. 
An effort was made in the legislature of 1891 to withdraw the appropriation, and a 
committee was appointed to investigate the subject of normal schools. The report 
was highly favorable, as will be seen by the following extract: 
  The State may choose as to the manner of caring for her poor and vicious. She 
may take the children of the poor and so strengthen them by education as to save

them from the poorhouse, or she may enlarge the poorhouse to receive them and 
their progeny. Alabama must build more schools or more jails and penitentiaries. 
Which it shall be is a question for your decision. As to your present decision, you 
know better than any others what it is to be; we may all be assured of the final 
decision as to public schools in Alabama. They have come to stay and grow asin 
other sections of our country, and this means that they will get more than a niggardly 
support. Alabama will yet attain greater things in the education of her masses. 
The public school, once seen and admitted to be a necessity, we may better judge 
as to our next point—the means of rendering effective this great agent of the people’s 
‘intellectual, moral, industrial, and material well-being—good and well-trained 
teachers. There are some good teachers who became so by their own self-training, 
just as there are some people who become great scholars without attending school, 
oras some lawyers, physicians, or ministers become professionally skilled without 
taking a course ata professional school. But it has been found that schools are 
helpful to scholarship, and that few ever get scholarship outside of their walls. It 
has likewise been found that professional schools give more systematic and exten- 
sive training than is likely to be secured without them. The normal school is the 
teacher’s professional school, as is the medical the physician’s, the mechanical the 
machinist’s, the military the soldier’s, the naval the sailor’s. The State aids in the 
maintenance of schools for other professions, although these do not enter her direct 
employment after graduation, but are dependent upon fees derived from practice for 
all their remuneration. Not so with the teachers. They are to be employed by the 
State. In this they are like army and nayal officers.. The Army and Navy are 
Government enterprises, and to secure success in the managemert of these the Goy- 
ernment trains her own officers in schools erected and supported »y the Government 
for that purpose. This insures skill, uniformity, and efficiency. When the State 
undertakes a vast system of public schools to insure skill, uniforinity, and efficiency 
in management she trains her own commanders (teachers) like the Government, at 
least in part. * * * In view of the facts heretofore enumerated, we hereby 
express it as our best judgment that it would be unwise to abolish the normal schools, 
and we recommend their continued and increased support, as their necessities may 
be made to appear from time to time in the future.?         
The report of the committee was adopted by a close vote, and the normal schools 
are safe, at least for the present. 
The State Normal College, as it is now called, of Troy, Ala., embraces two schools. 
I. Normal College, including the departments of (1) pedagogy and ethics; (2) 
English and civics; (3) pure and applied mathematics; (4) Latin language and 
literature; (5) natural science; (6) vocal and instrumental music; (7) physical train- 
ing and education; (8) art, painting, and drawing; (9) penmanship and business. 
II. Model schools: (1) High-school department; (2) intermediate department; 
(3) primary and kindergarten department. The entire work from the entrance of 
the kindergarten to graduation from the normal college is carefully graded and occu- 
pies twelve years. 
The departments of elocution, music, art, and business receive no support from 
the funds of the board before mentioned. 
The number of students in the normal school proper seems to haye been, in 1890, 
177; in the high school 124, and in special departments (music, elocution, art, and 
business), 239.7 
A late circular gives the following: 
  Courses of study. 
(1) Pedagogic, elementary and complete, three and four years, respectively; lead- 
ing to the degree of bachelor of pedagogy. 
(2) Scientific, four years, embracing the branches most essential to a modern 
education, thorough and practical. Degree, bachelor of science. 
(3) Philosophic, five years, embracing both pedagogic and scientific courses. 
Degree, bachelor of philosophy. 
(4) Music, vocal and instrumental, a thorough two years’ course. 
(5) Art, painting and drawing in its various forms, a two years’ course.

sartean theory.

The model school is divided into three departments—primary, intermediate, and 
high school. The number of students in the normal department for the year 
1889-90 was 177, excluding high-school pupils, ‘‘irregulars,’”’ and special collegiates 
(music, elocution, art, and business). The grand total enrollment of different names 
was 506.

The Livingston Female Academy, which was incorporated in 1840, is now called 
the Alabama Normal College for Girls. The State legislature of 1882-83 made to the 
girls of Alabama the first gift which the women of the State had ever received from 
the public treasury—an annual appropriation of $2,000 and a donation of $500 to

enable the directors of the Livingston Academy to add a normal department to the 
existing institution. 
The full course of the college includes three departments—primary, intermediate, 
and collegiate. The normal course is identical with the collegiate, but with the 
addition of methods of teaching common-school studies, history of education, school 
laws of the State, and practice teaching. 
The number of normal students (1891-92) is 35. 
The whole number of normal graduates since 1884 is 72.1 
LOUISIANA. 
Srare Norman Scnoon, Narcurrocnes. 
The Louisiana State Normal was founded by an act of the general assembly in 
1884. Under the provisions of that act the State board of education located the 
school at Natchitoches and appointed a board of administrators, but in 1888 it was 
enacted ‘‘That the board of administrators of the State Normal School shall consist 
of six competent white citizens, who shall be selected and appointed by the State 
board of education—one from each of the five circuits of the courts of appeals, and 
one from the city of Natchitoches.’’ The school was opened in November, 1885, 
under Dr. Edward E. Sheib as president, who continued in charge till 1888, when 
he resigned and was succeeded by Prof. Thomas D. Boyd, who is now at the head 
of the institution. 
The school grounds contain about 20 acres under fence and 80 acres of open wood- 
land. The property, formerly occupied as a convent by the Sisters of the Sacred 
Heart, was purchased by the town and parish of Natchitoches and donated to the 
State for the use of the normal school. The buildings are comfortable, but entirely 
too small for the accommodation of a school which is growing so rapidly as this has 
done. The attendance in the normal department for the years 1888-1892 (both 
inclusive) was as follows: 42, 44, 84, 188, 163. The State appropriation for the last 
two years was $12,500 each year; $2,500 of this amount for insurance and repairs. 
A liberal donation from the Peabody fund—$3,650 over that of former years—supple- 
mented the State appropriation and enabled the school to continue without 
interruption in its prosperous career. 
The faculty consists of the president, 5 professors, and 5 assistants and specialists. 
The course of instruction covers three years of eight months each, as follows: 
First year.—Arithmetic, English grammar and composition, geography, history of 
United States, physiology and hygiene, penmanship, and bookkeeping. 
Second year.—Advanced arithmetic, algebra, rhetoric, English literature, zoology, 
botany, general history, psychology, civil government, and history of education. 
Third year.—Geometry, English literature, physics, chemistry, psychology, ethics, 
pedagogy, methods of teaching, school management, and practice teaching in the 
practice school. 
     
PRACTICE SCHOOL. 
In the practice school, consisting of four primary grades, the usual branches of 
such grades, including drawi ing, vocal music and calisthenics, are taught by the most 
approved modern methods. These grades are in charge of trained normal graduates, 
and form as indispensable an adjunct to a normal school as is the workshop toa 
school of practical mechanics, or the hospital toa medical college. For an hour each 
day the members of the senior normal class, divided into groups, are required to give 
lessons in these grades. This work is not mere experiment nor observation, but 
bona fide teaching under the direction of trained specialists. The work 1s reduced 
to a system, each student teacher being required to prepare the lesson beforehand 
in all its details, according to a plan devised by the training teacher. At the expi- 
ration of the practice hour the members of the senior class again assemble in their

  class rooms, when their work is subjected to the criticism of their classmates and of 
their training teacher, who point out all errors both in government and in instruc- 
tion. No young teacher could go through this daily experience for months without 
acquiring much of that presence of mind, that self-control, that fertility of resources, 
and that ready knowledge of methods and devices which give the surest guaranty of 
success, not only in the schoolroom, but in any other field of human endeavor. 
    Admission.—The school is open to students of either sex. Applicants are required 
to be at least 16 years of age, and of good moral character; they must declare their 
intention to remain at the normal school until graduation unless sooner discharged, 
and must certify in writing their full intention to teach in the public schools of Loui- 
siana for one year after graduation; they are also required to pass a satisfactory 
examination in the ordinary common school branches, ‘“‘ unless exempt from such 
examination by virtue of an adequate diploma or teacher’s certificate.’’? On success- 
fully completing the course of study the student receives a diploma which entitles 
the holder to a first-grade teacher’s certificate, which is valid for four years.” 
VI. 
STATE NORMAL SCHOOLS IN CALIFONIA, OREGON, AND ARIZONA. 
CALIFORNIA. 
When the first normal school in California was opened, July 1862, but eight out 
the thirty-four States then in the Union had established State normal schools. These 
schools numbered 14 in all, distributed in the order of the date of opening as follows: 
Massachusetts, 4; New York, 2; Pennsylvania, 3: Connecticut, 1; Michigan, 1; New 
Jersey, 1; Illinois, 1; Minnesota, 1. Besides these, Philadelphia, Boston, and St. 
Louis each had a flourishing city normal school. 
The necessity for the establishment of a State normal school in California was first 
urged by a few gentlemen in San Francisco, among whom were the State superin- 
tendent, Andrew J. Moulder; his successor, John Sweet; and the city superintendent, 
Henry B. James. By the earnest efforts of these gentlemen a city normal school was 
established in San Francisco in 1857. The sessions of the school were held weekly 
and the attendance of the city teachers was made compulsory. This school was con- 
tinued until 1862; its graduates numbered 54. 
In his annual school reports of 1859 and 1860 State Superintendent Moulder recom- 
mended the establishment of a State normal school, but both of the succeeding legis- 
Jatures adjourned without action. When he appealed personally to the members of 
the legislature to pass the law organizing the school, not a fewlof them admitted that 
they did not know what a normal school was. 
During the session of the first California State Teachers’ Association, held in San 
Francisco, May, 1861, a committee was appointed to examine and report upon the 
subject of normal schools. This report was embodied by Superintendent Moulder in 
his report to the legislature of 1862, and earnestly commended by him to their con- 
sideration, with the statement that an appropriation of $5,000 would be sufficient to 
establish the school and put it in successful operation. The result of the combined 
efforts of the State superintendent and the teachers’ institute was that an act was 
passed by the legislature, May 2, 1862, providing for the establishment of a State 
normal school and appropriating $3,000 for its support for five months. The first 
and second sections of this act read as follows: 
1. The board of education of the State of California, together with the superinten- 
dents of common schools in the cities of San Francisco, Sacramento, and Marysville, 
are hereby constituted, ex officio, a board of trustees for the normal school of the State 
of California, as hereinafter provided.

2. Such board of trustees shall be known and designated as the ‘ Board of trustees 
of the State Normal School,”’ and they shall have power to establish and maintain in 
the city of San Francisco, or at such other places as the legislature shall hereafter 
direct, a normal school for the free instruction in the theory and practice of teaching 
of such citizens of this State as may desire to engage as teachers in the public schools 
thereof; to prescribe a course of study for such normal school, and the text-books to 
be used therein; to examine, employ, and fix the salaries of teachers therein; to hold 
stated examinations of the pupils attending such normal school, and to award certifi- 
cates and diplomas as hereinafter provided; to arrange and carry into effect all the 
details necessary to carry out the purposes of this act. 
San FRANcIsco. 
In pursuance of this act the board of education accepted the offer of the San Fran- 
cisco board of education, tendering to the normal school the use of a vacant room in 
the high school building, together with apparatus. The offer was accepted, and the 
board advertised that the school would be opened on the third Monday in July. A 
large attendance was anticipated and there was much discussion as to the proper 
apportionment of seats, so that each county in the State might secure its proportion- 
ate privileges in the school, while at the same time sufficient advantages should be 
afforded ‘‘to the greater number of persons who will undoubtedly seek admission 
to the school from our large cities.’’ The number of pupils to be admitted during 
the first term was finally limited to 60, provided that at least 1 pupil shall be 
admitted from each county. The expectation that a large number of students would 
apply for admission was not realized. On the day appointed for examination only 
5 applicants presented themselves. Three days afterwards the school was organized 
in a room on the ground floor of the high school building, with Ahira Holmes, of 
San Francisco, as principal. The number of students increased until at the close of 
the term the school numbered 31, of whom 3 were young men. A considerable 
number of those admitted were found to be exceedingly deficient in the knowledge 
of the common-school branches, as well as in the mental discipline and intellectual 
vigor necessary to pursue the studies of the course to advantage. The declaration 
required by the trustees at admission was as follows: ‘‘ We, the subscribers, do hereby 
declare that it is our intention to engage permanently in teaching in the common 
“schools of this State, and that it is our object in resorting to this school to prepare 
ourselves for the discharge of this important duty; and we moreoyer pledge ourselves 
to remain at least one term in the school, and to observe faithfully all the regulations 
of the institution so long as we continue members thereof.”” 
The unfortunate and unnecessary word ‘‘permanently’”? no doubt frightened off 
many girls who were also candidates for matrimonial honors, but who might have 
taught school for several years with great success. In the pledge now in use the 
objectionable word is omitted. 
The act establishing the school provided for but one session of five months, but the 
board decided to open a second session and trust to the liberality of the legislature to 
carry it through. Their expectation was not disappointed. During the term three 
special teachers were employed—in music, drawing, and calisthenics, respectively. 
The whole number of students in attendance during the year was 50. The subjects 
taught were practical and mental arithmetic, physical and descriptive geography, 
English grammar and analysis, rhetoric, composition, reading, penmanship, algebra, 
plane geometry, physiology, natural philosophy, vocal music, and theory and prac- 
tice of teaching. 
The school began its second year no longer an experiment but an established State 
institution. Its first year of work had proved both the necessity for its existence 
and its possibilities of usefulness. The legislature of 1863 repealed the first act 
establishing the school and passed a second act, substantially the same, embodying 
it as part of the State school law and making an appropriation of $6,000, which was 
double the original appropriation for the first year. 
   
-P-A-G-E-1171
  
NORMAL SCHOOLS IN THE UNITED STATES. 2411 
In January, 1864, the school was reorganized and divided into senior, junior, and 
subjunior classes, and a regular course of study for each class was prescribed by the 
board. By the new regulations each member of the senior class was required to 
spend one week in the model school and to write a full report of the work done 
while there. The haste of pupils to graduate was a great hindrance to the best sue- 
cess of the school, as it has been even in the best of schools to the present day. 
The following extracts from a letter written by a graduate of the class of 1864 will 
give some idea of the difficulties encountered in the early days of this school: 
  My introduction to the school was made in the fall of 1862. It was then held ina 
side room of the high school of San Francisco. The room resembled a hat room 
deprived of its racks and improvised with rickety seats. The normalites were 
intruders upon the domain of the high-school pupils; hence had no rights that they 
could call their own. Ahira Holmes was principal, vice-principal, assistant, and pro- 
fessor to all the 25 normalites—that is, when they were in attendance. 
In the beginning of 1863 we were moved to a tumble-down, two-story wooden 
structure on Fourth street. The place we went to was worse than the place we left; 
for while it stood on what may well be termed a stable foundation, it was shaky, and 
its outside stairs upon their two posts were shaky. When vehicles went rumbling 
over their cobbled way we suspended our class exercises; we had to, for the tremble, 
rattle, roar, and clatter drowned human voices. We had other misfortunes—there 
were no maps, apparatus, nor books of reference in or about our school. We had 
one piece of furniture in addition to our seats and desks—a piano, hired by the pupils. 
During the first term the school waned and waxed. In waning it went down to 
about 20 pupils; then it ran up to 30; it trembled in the balance. The pupils held 
council what to do—to forsake the institution in a body, or continue faithful to the 
end. The decision was to stay with the school—old house and all. We were faith- 
ful tothe end. From that time the school has gone on to prosperity. 
The year of 1864-65 shows a continued increase of attendance and in the general 
efficiency of the school. The growing interest and confidence throughout the State 
in normal-school work are shown by the fact that twenty-three counties were repre- 
sented by the new students admitted during the year. An arrangement was made 
with the San Francisco board of education by which four normal students were 
detailed each week to teach either as substitutes or assistants in the public schools of 
the city. This arrangement did not prove altogether satisfactory. 
In June, 1865, Mr. George W. Minns, principal of the Boys’ High School of San 
Francisco, was elected principal of the California State Normal School. The school 
opened for the year on the 10th of July, in Dashaway Hall, the model school being 
for a time disbanded. After six weeks it was transferred to the Lincoln School 
building, then just completed. In September it was again removed, this time to a 
primary-school building. Here the normal school found a permanent home during 
the remainder of its stay in San Francisco, and sang the song of the Psalmist (Rouse’s 
version )— Woe ’s me that I in Mesach dwell 
A sojourner so long, 
That I in tabernacles dwell 
To Kedar that belong! 
By an act approved March, 1866, the State board of education was made to consist 
of the governor, the State superintendent of public instruction, the principal of the 
Normal School, the superintendents of schools of San Francisco, Sacramento County, 
Santa Clara County, San Joaquin County, and two professional teachers nominated. 
by the State superintendent and elected by the board. By the same act the State 
board of education, with the exception of the principal of the State Normal School, 
was constituted the board of trustees of the State Normal School. 
The revised school law provided that the graduates of the Normal School should 
receive State certificates of a grade to be determined by the State board of examin- 
ation. Under this provision some graduates received diplomas, and others, first, 
second, or third grade certificates, the standing of each member being determined

by taking into consideration the recitation records during the term, the report of 
success in the training school, and the result of the written examination at the close 
of the term. 
San Josn. 
In May, 1868, Dr. William T. Lucky being principal of the Normal School, the 
subject of a permanent location for the school began to be agitated, and in 1870 the 
legislature selected San José as the location and enacted a law providing for the selec- 
tion of a site and the erection of a building. Some amendments were made to the 
Jaws governing the school, the principal change being in the constitution of the board 
of trustees, which was made to consist of the governor, the State superintendent of 
public instruction, and five others to be appointed by the governor. The same act 
appropriated $24,000, biennially, ‘‘ which said appropriation shall be set apart at the 
commencement of each fiscal year to support the State Normal School.” 
The corner stone of the first California State Normal School building was laid 
October 20, 1870, with imposing Masonic ceremonies conducted by the Grand Lodge 
of the State. The first session of the school in San José was opened in June, 1871, 
in rooms temporarily furnished by the city board of education. The new building 
was completed in 1876 at a cost of about $285,000. Though but imperfectly adapted 
to school purposes, it was a handsome building, both in architectural design and in 
details of finish, with numerous porticoes supported by Corinthian pillars, handsome 
entrances, wide corridors, and spacious halls. It is unfortunate that so large an 
amount of time, money, and skill should haye been expended on a building con- 
structed almost entirely of wood. In November, 1873, a preparatory class was organ- 
ized, whose special work was a thorough review of the elementary branches in 
preparation for the work of the junior class. During this year the senior class began 
regular practice work in the training school, the classes of which were made up of 
pupils from the public schools of the ci But in the following year the training 
school was opened as a pay school independent of the city schools, and soon became 
nearly self-sustaining. 
In 1876 the course of study was extended to three years—junior, middle, and senior. 
In this year the legislature raised the annual appropriation to $24,000. 
With the school year of 1879-80 came a catastrophe which resulted in giving the 
strongest possible proof of the vitality of the school and of its hold upon the confi- 
dence of the people. On the morning of Tuesday, February 10, 1880, the building 
was totally destroyed by fire, originating, it is supposed, in a defective chute. The 
total loss was estimated at $304,000. The board of education of the city of San José 
promptly tendered the high-school building for the use of the normal school, making 
arrangements to accommodate the high-school classes in other schools. Thus the 
school was enabled to continue its work with but one day’s interruption. 
On the 12th of April, 1880, the legislature passed a bill appropriating $100,000 for 
the erection of another building at San José for the use of the State Normal School, 
and work on the new building was at once begun. 
During the legislative discussions in reference to the normal school twe assertions 
were made which did the school great injustice. One was that the normal schoo! was 
a San José or Santa Clara County high school, and therefore should not be sustained 
by the State. In answer to this it was shown that during the current year 275 
students had entered from counties outside of Santa Clara. The other allegation was 
that the graduates of the normal school were not as well qualified as many graduates 
of high schools; that they could not pass the examination to enter the junior class 
of the university, ete. To this it was replied that the normal school is not a high 
school, nor is it a preparatory school for the university. It has for its object the 
preparation of teachers for the district schools of the State. The most advanced 
graduates of the high schools find it hard work in one year to complete the review

studies and the training required in the normal school. One-third of the time of 
this year is devoted to the study and practice of teaching. The mere assertion that 
alter this year’s work students are not as well prepared to teach as those who know 
alittle more Latin or French can carry but little weight. 
Work on the new building was begun in May, 1880, and was prosecuted with such 
vigor that the school was able to occupy its new quarters in May, 1881. The new 
edifice, though plainer in its exterior than its predecessor, is well adapted to the 
purposes of the school, being modeled after the most approved normal-school struc- 
tures in the East, and it has been pronounced by well-informed persons who have 
had ample opportunities for observation to be inferior to none on the continent at 
the time of its erection. Notwithstanding its spaciousness the school gave promise 
of rapidly outgrowing its accommodations. 
In February, 1881, the legislature made an appropriation of $25,000 for improving 
and fencing the normal-school square. The grounds were carefully laid out, walks 
and drives graveled, flowers and trees planted. New lawns have from time to time 
been laid out and additional flower beds and trees planted, so that the grounds are 
now a place of delightful recreation to the students and an ornament to the city. 
In no way is the intellectual life of a school more clearly indicated than in the 
increasing use of the library. With the occupation of the new building came the 
employment of a special librarian, who kept the library open all day. The arrange- 
ment in the course of study of a study hour at the school building for each pupil 
opened the door to an increased use of reference books and gaye some additional 
time for general reading. Visiting committees from the legislature, seeing both the 
usefulness of the library and the need of more books, recommended special appro- 
priations for the benefit of the library, which were cheerfully granted. This in 
turn reacted upon both teachers and students, who, finding that more and better 
books were provided, were induced to make more and better use of them. In addi- 
tion to these inducements the topical method of study, now growing in use and 
favor, by which the student is given a subject to investigate rather than a portion of 
some book to master, necessarily led to the demand for many books on each sub- 
ject. The importance to the student of this familiarity with books can scarcely be 
overestimated. The library numbered in 1889 about 3,500 volumes. By the con- 
tinued liberal appropriations of the legislature new books are added yearly, and an 
additional building is now needed. 
By the course of study adopted in 1884 it is provided that each member of the 
senior class should spend one recitation period each day for three-fourths of the year 
in the training department—the first ten weeks in observation and the last five 
months in teaching. During the half term spent in observation, the pupils write 
out, as regular exercises, criticisms upon the work of pupil teachers and analyses of 
model lessons given by the regular critic teachers, besides receiving special lectures 
upon the work they have observed. During the five months of actual practice 
work they are required to make special preparation for each recitation under the 
supervision of the regular critic teachers, who give both class lectures and individual 
criticism. From the one class with which it began, the training department grew 
until it included four distinct subdivisions—primary, intermediate, grammar, and 
advanced grammar. From the time the pupil enters the lowest junior class until he 
graduates his attention is kept fixed on the fact that he is learning each subject with 
a view of imparting it to others, and the method of presentation is made a subject 
of continued observation. The pupil is thus from the beginning trained to teach. 
The philosophy of the work he has not at first culture enough to appreciate, or even 
to understand. As he advances to riper scholarship he receives about one hundred 
and twenty lectures, beginning with an outline of mental philosophy, upon methods 
of teaching, grading, and disciplining a school. These lectures cover not only the 
philosophy of education, but practical and detailed instruction in the minutiz of

teaching. Students are required to take copious notes of those lectures and to rewrite 
them for future reference. They thus are enabled to carry away with them volumi- 
nous notebooks of original work, intended and fitted to be guidebooks to young 
teachers when they come to reduce theory to practice. 
In 1887 a workroom was fitted up and provided with tools for the use of pupils. 
For the first year instruction was given only by the regular teachers, but this not 
proving satisfactory, a skilled mechanic was employed during a part of the year to 
superintend the workshop. Attendance was entirely optional, but the results were 
satisfactory. An exhibit of students’ work at the close of the term showed fancy 
tables, easels, footstools, ete., all of creditable workmanship.!

| Los ANGELES. 
In March, 1881, an act was passed by’ the legislature establishing a “Branch State 
Normal School in Los Angeles County,’’ the site to be selected and the building 
located by the board of trustees at San José. The school was opened in August, 
1882, ina handsome and conyenient building in the city of Los Angeles. The attend- 
ance the first year was 126 in the normal department, and 150 in the training school. 
The course of study arranged was the same as that of the school at San José, and 
both in the organization of the school and its management the parent institution was 
closely followed, and with most satisfactory results. 
The legislature of 1890 made an appropriation of $10,000 for building and furnish- 
ing a gymnasium. Each student is required to practice calisthenic or gymnastic 
exercises for one recitation every day under the supervision of a skilled and careful 
instructor. 
The number of students entered on the catalogue of 1890-91 was, in normal classes, 
288; in model and practice school, 200.

The legislature, in 1887, created another branch normal school, to be located at 
Chico, in northern California. It was opened in 1889 with 80 pupils, under the prin-

the school year.

Monmouth, the seat of the Oregon State Normal School, isin Polk County, 2 miles 
west of the Willamette River and 70 miles from Portland by rail. The State Normal 
School was established at this place in 1883. The necessity for such an institution 
was manifested by the fact that as soon as the school was opened students began 
to gather in from different parts of the State, and during the first year 104 were 
enrolled. The enthusiasm spread, and the number in attendance the second year 
was double that of the first; the fourth year showed an enrollment of 227; the fifth 
year, 261; the sixth year the attendance was so large that it was found necessary 
to suspend the model school until the new building should be completed. The new

building is a magnificent brick structure especially adapted to its peculiar purpose, 
and is the gift of Polk County to the normal school. 
The normal curriculum is divided into three courses. The elementary occupies one 
year; the regular, two years; and the advanced, one year. The elementary course 
includes, as professional studies, object teaching and use of apparatus, methods in 
arithmetic and grammar, methods in geography, reading, and history, and school 
organization; in mathematics, arithmetic; in sciences, geography, map drawing, and 
history; in English, grammar, analysis, and composition; in art, etc., elocution, 
vocal music, penmanship. 
In the regular course the studies of the first year are, professional: school manage- 
ment, teaching in graded schools, hygiene of schoolroom, methods in mathematics 
and science; mathematical: algebra; science: philosophy and chemistry; English: 
rhetoric, English literature, ancient and medieval history; art: elocution, vocal 
music, penmanship. 
Second year, professional: civil government, Orgeon school law, constitution of 
Oregon, history of education; mathematical: geometry and bookkeeping; science: 
physiology, geology, astronomy, botany; English and mental science: ancient and 
mediva! history, modern history, mental science; art: elocution, vocal music, 
penmanship. 
The studies of the advanced course are, school gradation, school supervision, 
institute work, philosophy of education; trigonometry, surveying, mechanics; 
commercial law, political economy, moral philosophy, logic; German, French; 
Cesar, Cicero, Virgil. 
The graduating class of 1889 numbered 36; that of 1890, 21. 
Graduates of the State Normal schools of Oregon receive diplomas good for six 
years in any public school of the State; after which, if successful in teaching, they 
are entitled to life diplomas. : 
There are four other State Normal schools in Oregon, located, respectively, at Drain, 
Weston, The Dalles, and Ashland.!

This school was established by an act of the thirteenth legislature, aménded and 
reenacted in 1887. The objects of the school are declared by said act to be the 
instruction of persons, both male and female, in the art of teaching and in all the 
branches that pertain to a good common school education; also to give instruction in 
the mechanical arts and in husbandry and agricultural chemistry, in the fundamental 
laws of the United States, and in what regards the rights and duties of citizenship. 
Applicants for admission are required to be not less than 15 years of age, and 
should be able to parse the words of any ordinary sentence; to solve any problem in 
arithmetic up to and including decimal fractions; to bound any State or Territory 
and to locate the principal rivers and cities of the world; to write a legible hand, and 
to read intelligently. 
The Normal School building is a brick structure, 60 by 70 feet and one story high. 
A 10-foot hall extends through the building from north to south. The building is sur- 
mounted by a high roof, leaving a space of 8 feet between the roof and the ceiling. 
The entire structure is surrounded bya veranda 12 feet wide. Ventilators admit the 
passage of air in every direction. 
Tuition is free to those who obtain an appointment from a member of the legis- 
lature and to those who sign the declaration that they attend the school for the 
purpose of preparing themselves for teaching in the public schools of Arizona.

All others are charged $1 per month. In order to graduate the student must be at 
least 18 years of age, must have attended the school for a period of at least twenty- 
two weeks, and must pass a written examination in all the studies of the course. 
Graduates receive certificates which entitle them to teach a grammar school in any 
county in the Territory. 
The regular course of study requires three years for its completion. The studies 
of the first year are reading (3), geography (3), grammar (3), history (3), drawing 
(3), arithmetic (3), spelling (3). 
The studies of the second year are geography (1), arithmetic (2), spelling (8), 
writing (1), rhetoric (1), zoology (1), bookkeeping (1), physics (1), physiology (1), 
algebra (3), botany (1), pedagogy (1). 
The studies of the third year are grammar (1), arithmetic (1), pedagogy (2), 
algebra (2), geology (1) (optional), school law and ethics (1) (optional), geometry 
(2), chemistry (1), civil government (1), astronomy (1), English literature (1). 
Each school year is divided into three terms, and the figures above indicate the 
number of terms devoted to that subject in each year. 
The following is the syllabus of the lessons in pedagogy: 
Practical pedagogy.—Brief study of the mind; the teacher; the pupil; the parent; 
the school house and grounds; school management; discipline; recitations. 
Theoretical pedagogy.—More complete ep of the mind and sen ultivation of 
the mind and senses; cultivation of memory, judgment, reason, imagination, etc. ; 
the emotions; the will; nature and use of punishment. 
History of education.—Biographies of noted educators; discussion of their methods, 
theories, and attainments; a thorough examination of the educational value of 
common public schools. 
School law and ethics.—The right; the conscience; motives; passions; habit; dif- 
ferent ethical systems. An analysis of the school law of Arizona. 
The faculty consists of the principal, filling the chairs of language, mathematics, 
and pedagogy; and one professor, teacher of reading, history, literature, and natural 
science. 
The number of students, session of 1890-91, was 30; 27 in the junior class, and 3 
in the senior.’

* NORMAL SCHOOLS FOR COLORED TEACHERS. 
The preceding chapters have been devoted to the consideration of normal schools 
for white students controlled by the State and supported wholly or in great part by 
the State. It was considered unadvisable to take up the history of normal schools 
for colored people in the same connection, because the two classes are so different 
that they afford no grounds for comparison. They arose under different circum- 
stances, were carried on by different agencies, and were actuated by different pur- 
poses. The former sprung out of a growing conviction of the necessity of better 
teachers for the common schools; the latter from the want of any teachers. The 
one had a single purpose in view—the elevation of the common schools by the agency 
of qualified teachers; the other had for its purpose the elevation of a race by the 
creation of suitable schools. The progress of the one has been largely professional 
and intellectual, with occasional deviations in the direction of higher education, the 
industries, and xsthetics; the progress of the other has been in a small degree purely 
professional; in still larger measure academic, moral, religious, and industrial, with 
occasional flights into the region of classical and scientific learning and considerable 
dalliance with music. There are few institutions of the latter class known by title 
as ‘‘normal schools.’’? There are ‘‘ normal universities,’’ ‘‘ normal colleges,’’ ‘‘nor- 
mal and collegiate institutions,” ‘‘normal seminaries,’’ and many universities and 
colleges with ‘normal departments.”

NORMAL SCHOOLS IN THE UNITED STATES. 2417 
The establishment and maintenance of the State normal schools hitherto consid- 
ered have been due 2ither to the State solely, or to the State aided by local com- 
munities, and occasionally to local communities aided by the State. The origin of 
colored normal schools (the phrase is used for brevity and not by preference) was 
due to one or more of the following instrumentalities: 
1. The National Government. 
2. Religious or philanthropic associations. ; 
38. Individual generosity. 
4. State governments. 
It is obviously impracticable, within the limits necessarily prescribed to this essay, 
to notice all the normal institutions or departments included in these classes. A 
selection of typical instances will be made, but the actual conditions and prospects 
of practical normal training will not be accurately represented without carefully 
weighing the report of the Hon. J. L. M. Curry to the trustees of the John F. Slater 
fund, from which the following extracts are made: 
In some of the towns and cities there is possibly an unwise multiplication of denom- 
inational or independent schools. Christian denominations are rivals in their estab- 
lishment, in getting the largest number of pupils, and in making the most attractive 
exhibition. It seems to be a weakness and an error common to all to seek to cata- 
logue as many namesas possible. The aggregate names, not the habitual and average 
attendance, but all who for any time, one day or several months, have matriculated. 
This militates against the usefulness and popularity of the free schools. In so far as 
these institutions not under State contro! impair the efficiency of, or divert attend- 
ance from, the public schools, they are mischievous; for the great mass of children, 
white and black, must more in the future than at present depend almost exclusively 
upon the State schools for the common branches of education. These schools, per- 
manent, not subject to caprice or varying seasons, incorporated into the body politic, 
must be the chief factor in the education of the people. * * * Theschoolsaided by 
the Slater fund give instruction in the primary grades, and a preponderant percentage 
of the pupils never get beyond what should be taught in a good public school. The 
normal work is generally superficial, and is appended to the curriculum more as a future 
expectancy than as a present realization. [The italics are the editor’s.] These schools 
have unquestionably improved the negro teachers in the South. Teaching always 
derives benefit from the discipline, the knowledge, the culture of those who teach, 
and it would be unjust and unkind to withhold proper acknowledgment of the 
improvement of the teachers and of the cause of it. Nevertheless it is indisputable 
that the normal training is lacking in system, thoroughness, and the application of 
educational psychology. Persons are called and commissioned as teachers because 
they have passed creditably through the literary course of these schools. Such prep- 
aration for their work is excellent, essential, because professional skill must rest on 
scholarship, but it does not come up to modern requirements and possibilities. The 
normal work, as aided by us, shou!d be more professional and more systematically 
and concentratively adapted to the preparation of teachers for school work. The 
higher literary instruction should be supplemented by a course suited to training 
teachers to teach. Improved teaching is the prime need of our school; and the surest 
and cheapest method of adyancing general education and of meeting our obligations 
as a board is to aid in providing qualified teachers. 
In all the schools some industries are taught, rather for the purpose of preparing 
the pupils for making a living by a trade, and of aiding in the maintenance of the 
schools by the sale of products, than for the development of the powers of the mind, 
and gaining a truer and ampler knowledge of the world ‘‘and of things as they exist in 
nature and are used in the industrial arts.” These industries, thus pursued, do good 
to the individual negro, but they are an infinitesimal factor in working out the prob- 
Jem of ‘uplifting the lately emancipated population of the Southern States.” 
Physical labor has been found advantageous in restraining appetites and preventing 
vicious indulgences, in dignifying and elevating manual labor as proper in itself, in 
economic production, in the manufacture of products, the sale or consumption of which 
helps in the difficult and ever recurring problem of how the school shall live from 
year to year; but the rationale of the use of tools and of construction, with examples 
of the application of science to art, may often be: the best function of the manual- 
training school. Even where skillful and intelligent superintendents were found by 
us, the foremen were often merely mechanics, without general education, performing 
their work without understanding the principles involved. A blacksmith heats and

hammers and welds iron and puts it into shape, but he does nothing more. Itisa 
wrong to the men, to the schools, to the race, to allow such superficialit , such, 
weary apprenticeship. The first need in a shop, as in a school, is a competent 
instructor. . . . I venture to recommend strongly larger appropriations for strictly 
normal work, and that what is given for that end be applied to the salaries of teachers 
of whose competency the educational committee is satisfied. 
  Tue Mixer Scuoor, Wasarneton, D. C. 
The first attempt at the education of colored girls as teachers was made in 
Washington, D. C., about the beginning of the year 1852. 
Miss Myrtilla Miner, a lady of Northern birth and an experienced teacher, had 
been for some years previous to this time a governess in a Southern family. There 
she became impressed with the conviction that colored children had need of educa- 
tion, that they were capable of education, and that, under the conditions then 
prevailing, they could be educated only by teachers of their own race. So she came, 
alone and unknown, to Washington on the 3d of December, 1851, to carry her con- 
victions into practical operation. She began on a small scale. She rented a small 
house, and gathered some 25 girls into it, and by rigid economy made the enterprise 
nearly self-sustaining. Contributions from personal friends in the North supplied 
what was lacking. 
So the school went on for four years amid many discouragements, but gradually gain- 
ing strength, when, by Miss Miner’s influence, a society was formed styled ‘‘The 
Washington Association for the Education of Free Colored Youth.’”’ The trustees were 
Samuel M. Janney, Loudoun County Va.; Johns Hopkins, Baltimore; Samuel Rhoads 
and Thomas Williams, Philadelphia; G. Bailey, M. D., and L. D. Gale, M. D., Wash- 
ington; W. W. Bellows, D.D., New York; A. E. Stowe, D. D., Andover, and Henry 
Ward Beecher, Brooklyn. The association issued a circular in 1856 making a strong 
appeal for “‘funds to build an edifice for a normal school for the education of colored 
female teachers already established in the city of Washington.” Their design was 
“to receive the more intelligent daughters of this [colored] people, educate and return 
them to their homes, to extend as parents and teachers the blessings of knowledge 
and religion.”’ ‘‘They would open an asylum where they may be brought, emanci- 
pated, educated, taught housewifery as well as science, and thus be prepared to 
become teachers.’’ An eligible site of 3 acres within the city limits had already been 
purchased, and the association asked for $20,000 to erect a suitable building. The 
enterprise was retarded for some years by the ill heaith of Miss Miner. Work and 
worry had undermined a constitution naturally delicate, and in 1861 she went to 
California hoping to regain her lost vigor. But an injury caused by being thrown 
from a carriage robbed her of her little remaining strength, and she returned to 
Washington in July, 1864, to die. The Miner ot is her only monument, and a 
few words will complete its history to date (1892).! 
In 1863 Congress passed an act to incorporate the institution for the education of 
colored youth in the District of Columbia. This was the original Miner School. 
In 1877 an agreement was entered into between the trustees of the Miner School 
fund and the trustees of the public schools by which the former undertook to build 
a suitable schoolhouse between Fourth and Seventeenth streets west and R and P. 
streets north, upon plans prepared by a joint committee of the two bodies, and the 
Jatter to take entire charge of the building. The trustees of the Miner School 
reserved the right to appoint teachers. 
Dual managements are rarely successful. The contract was terminated in 1887. 
The Miner School has now no connection with the public schools, and as a normal 
school has ceased to exist.”

The Thirty-ninth Congress conferred upon the Howard University a charter with 
the most liberal provisions, specifying the following departments: Normal, collegiate, 
theological, law, medicine, and agriculture. The normal department was opened in 
May, 1867, in a building leased by the Freedmen’s Bureau for that purpose, on 
Seventh street, near the northern limits of the city. A farm of 150 acres, situated on 
the heights on Seventh street north, and overlooking the city and the surrounding 
country, was afterwards purchased and the university buildings were erected thereon. 
The report of Howard University for the year 1874 states that the normal depart- 
ment is conducted under a joint committee of the university and the institution for 
the education of colored youth. The aggregate attendance for the year was over 300, 
the ayerage for each term being 107, and the number of graduates for the year 7. 
In 1886 the number of normal students was 31, arranged in three classes, junior, mid- 
dle, and senior. In 1887 there were 43 names in the normal department. In 1888 
there were 53 names. The last catalogue, 1891, has 150 students in the ‘‘ normal and 
industrial department,” but it is impossible to say how many are “‘normal”’ and how 
many are. ‘‘industrial.’””. The normal students proper can not, however, exceed 34, 
being the number in the junior, middle, senior, and post-graduate cla: The nor- 
mal department has a principal and 5 instructors in the following chairs: English 
grammar, arithmetic and civics; mathematics and history; English composition, 
French and German; geography, and United States history. The industrial depart- 
ment has a superintendent, a matron and preceptress and 7 instructors, 1 in sewing, 
2 in mechanical drawing, 1 in printing, 1 in bookbinding, 1 in carpentering, and 1 in 
tin work. 
There is nothing in the normal course in the junior and middle years to distingu’ 
it from an ordinary high-school course. In the senior year students may take, in 
the second term, ‘‘theory and art of teaching or chemistry;’’ and in the third term, 
“methods of teaching or natural philosophy.’’ History of education is the only pre- 
scribed pedagogical study in this normal school. Even the post-graduate course has 
no pedagogical element. E

The Baltimore Colored Normal School is a survival of the ‘‘ Baltimore association 
for the moral and educational improvement of the colored people.’’ On the 28th of 
November, 1864, 26 philanthropic citizens of Baltimore met in a private house, pur- 
suant to an invitation by printed circular, ‘‘to consider the best means by organized 
effort, in view of the present condition of the colored people of the State, to promote 
their moral, religious, and educational improvement.’’ At this meeting a permanent 
organization was formed under the title given above, a constitution adopted, officers 
appointed, and a ‘‘special finance committee of ten to proceed at once to raise 
money.’”’? A special executive committee was also appointed and instructed “to 
start a school for the colored people, to rent rooms for the purpose, to procure 
teachers and furnish the school; also to rent and furnish rooms for the permanent 
occupancy of the board of managers, for which purposes they are authorized to draw 
upon the treasurer at their discretion.’’? 
Immediately after the Christmas holidays, January 3, 1865, a school for colored 
children was opened under the auspices of the association in the rooms of one of the 
colored churches, and a few days later ground was broken in the counties by the 
opening of a colored school in Easton, Talbot County. At the end of the year there 
were 7 colored schools in the city—16 rooms crowded to their utmost capacity—and 
18 schools in the counties. The total expenditure for the year was $17,556.95. This

amount was raised from several sources—collections by the finance committee, dona- 
tions from Society of Friends in England, Pennsylvania Freedmen’s Relief Associa- 
tion, appropriations from the city treasury, ete. A circular had been sent to 250 
ministers in charge of congregations, Christian and Hebrew, asking for aid and 
sympathy, and specially requesting ‘‘ whatever you may think or do, please acknowl- 
edge the receipt of this note.’”’ Twenty-three of the 250 did acknowledge it, but 
the only material aid from this source came from 2 rabbis—Rabbi Hockheimer and 
Rabbi Shold—each of whom sent a “‘contribution”’ with his reply to the circular. 
Outside of collections by the finance committee and the annual appropriation of 
$10,000 from the city treasury, the main reliance of the association was on the New 
England Freedmen’s Aid Association. ‘‘They have never failed us, nor have we 
ever called on them for assistance without receiving a cheerful and liberal response. 
Without their constant sympathy, encouragement, and generous aid our work would 
have amounted to but a small result, and very likely not have been continued.” 
One great difficulty with which the executive committee had to contend was the 
lack of competent teachers. White teachers met with no encouragement. Colored 
teachers were but poorly qualified. Both white and colored had to run the gauntlet. 
Owing to the still existing prejudices of our people, many of these teachers who 
have left comfortable homes to devote themselves to this great missionary labor have, 
instead of sympathy and encouragement, met with much harsh treatment. We 
instance the stoning of the children and teacher at Easton; the rough handling and 
blacking of the teacher at Cambridge; the indignation meeting held at Church Creek, 
Dorchester County, when resolutions were passed to drive out the teacher at that 
place; and last, but not least, the burning of church and schoolhouse at Millington, 
Kent County. These, with such outrages as the burning of colored churches in 
Cecil, Queen Anne, and Somerset counties, to prevent schools being opened in them, 
and the impossibility to obtain board for a white lady teacher in Annapolis add no 
little to the troubles of your committee. 
A normal school for colored teachers was felt to be a necessity, and with the 
promptitude which characterized all the operations of the association and its officers 
a normal school was opened in the second year of the association schools. Its first 
shelter was in a rented building, but in December, 1867, it was removed to the per- 
manent home which it still oceupies—a Friends’ meetinghouse, altered and specially 
adapted to its new uses. The secretary of the executive committee, Joseph M. Cush- 
ing, in the third and last annual report, says to the members of the association: 
In presenting this third annual report of our association we welcome you to this 
normal-school ‘building, just now ready for your occupancy. It seems. eminently 
fitting that this old meetinghouse, which for so many years has witnessed the peace- 
ful assembling of the Friends for spiritual communion, should hereafter be devoted 
to the dissemination of light and knowledge among those who have all their lives 
sat amid darkness and ignorance; that from this place the peaceful influences of edu- 
cation should issue to supplement and improve the results of war. This school is 
the legitimate result of our exertions for the past three years and is necessitated by 
our § ss in the work we have aimed to accomplish. We have now in operation 
in the counties of Maryland 73 schools, numbering nearly 5,000, and at the same 
time there are 50 new schoolhouses ready for occupancy and 39 others in course of 
erection, Ww hich will be finished during this year. * * 
To supply this immediate need of teachers in usin and also to answer the 
calls that will speedily come from the States farther South this normal school is open. 
Hence will go forth men and women thoroughly trained for the work of teaching, to 
carry to their own race the mental freedom from superstition and ignorance needed. 
to perfect the freedom from bodily thraldom which emancipation has accomplished. 
This building will stand, a protest eloquent in its silence against all assertions that 
the African race will not learn and can not be taught. 
      The operations of the association in the city, the Colored Normal School excepted, 
were terminated in the fall of 1867 by the schools being incorporated into the public- 
school system of the city. There were cee 73 schools in the counties which

were running at an expense of about $50,000 a year. These also were taken off the 
hands of the association in 1868, and became part of the State system of public educa- 
tion. Nothing is now (1892) left in visible and tangible form of the work of the old 
association but the normal school and the schoolhouses scattered over the State, many 
of them still used for their original purposes. But the stirring memories of those 
early days, the enthusiasm which carried the actors beyond the limits of what sober- 
minded people deemed possible, the brotherly feeling that brought help from North 
and East and from beyond the Atlantic, the dangers and the glories of ‘‘ Timbuctoo’’! 
will never pass away. 
“For freedom’s battle once begun, 
Bequeathed from bleeding sire to son, 
Though bafiled oft, is ever won.” 
The normal school is fortunate in having no sensational history. It lost two prin- 
cipals by resignation and one by death, but still continues on the even tenor of its 
way. The income is derived partly from a State appropriation and partly from 
tuition fees. The instruction given is principally academic; it has been found prac- 
tically impossible to retain pupils long enough for them to benefit by purely profes- 
sional studies. There are three grades, normal, grammar, and primary. Graduates 
from the normal department have no difficulty in obtaining places, and in general 
they make very acceptable teachers. The number of pupils in all grades has for 
many years averaged about 200.” 
‘VIRGINIA. 
HAMPTON NORMAL AND AGRICULTURAL INSTITUTE. 
The Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute stands on the east shore of Hamp- 
ton Creek, not far from Fort Monroe. The earliest English civilization on this con- 
tinent was established at Hampton, and the first slaves brought to America were 
landed only a few miles off. The American Missionary Association purchased the 
site on which the institute now stands—an estate of 120 acres, then known as ‘‘Little 
Scotland’’—fitted up the necessary buildings, and opened the school in April, 1868, 
with 20 scholars, on a manual-labor basis. Through liberal grants from the Freed- 
men’s Bureau and donations from Northern friends a large schoolhouse was erected, 
in which 300 students could recite. The farm was supplied with buildings, stock, and 
tools. An industrial department for the manufacture of clothing was built up, and a 
printing office was established, in which the various branches of the printing trade 
were taught. In June, 1870, the institute received a charter from the general assem- 
bly of Virginia creating a corporation with power to choose their own successors and 
to hold property without taxation. In 1872 the general assembly passed an act giv- 
ing to the institute one-third of the agricultural college land grant of Virginia. Its 
share was 100,000 acres, which was sold for $95,000. Nine-tenths of this money was 
invested in bonds bearing 6 per cent interest. The other tenth was expended in the 
purchase of additional land, increasing the size of the farm to 185 acres. The num- 
ber of pupils at the close of the fifth annual session was 213, representing different 
sections of Virginia and North and South Carolina. 
The normal course of study at this time included an academic course in the 
English language, elementary mathematics, natural science and history. Among 
the eight additional ‘‘ miscellaneous’’ studies is one called ‘‘ drill in teaching.’’

The following extracts from the first report of the principal, Gen. 8. C. Armstrong, 
made to the trustees in 1870, will show the ideas which, being logically followed for 
over twenty years, have made this institute the greatest school of the kind in this 
country, or in any country, and the model of many other great schools of similar 
purpose: 
What should be the character of an educational institution devoted to the poorer 
classes of the South? * * * Plainly a system is required which shall be at once 
constructive of mental and moral worth and destructive of the vices characteristic of 
the slave. What are these vices? They are improvidence, low ideas of honor and 
morality, and a general lack of directive energy, judgment, and foresight. * * * 
His deficiencies of character are, I believe, worse ior him and the wi orld than his 
ignorance. But with these deficiencies are a docility and entlusiasm for improve- 
ment and a perseverance in the pursuit of it which form a basis of great hope and 
justify any outlay and the ablest service in his behalf. At Hampton we are “trying 
to solve the problem of an education best suited to the needs of the poorer classes of 
the South by sending out to them teachers of moral strength as well as mental cul- 
ture, To this end the most promising youths. are selected. The poverty of these 
pupils has required the introduction of manual labor. 
The plan of combining mental and physical labor is a priori full of objections. It 
inyolves friction, constant embarrassment, and apparent disadvantage to educational 
advancement, as well as to the profits of various industries. But to the question, 
“Do your students have sufficient time to study all their lessons faithfully?’’ I should 
answer, ‘‘Not enough, judging from the common use of time, but under pressure they 
make good use of the hours they have; there is additional cuore y put forth, an 
increased rate of study which makes up for the time spent in manual labor, while the 
physical vigor gained affords abundant strength for severe mental labor.’”? Nothing 
is of more benefit than this compulsory waking up of the faculties. * * * How- 
ever the future may decide the question, our “two years’ experience of the manual- 
system has been satisfactory. Progressin study has been rapid and thorough— 
e to say not excelled in any school of the same grade; there have been. a 
steadiness and solidity of character and a spirit of self-denial developed, an apprecia- 
tion of the value of opportunities ‘manifested, which would not be possible under 
other conditions. * * There are two objectiv e points before us, toward one or 
the other of which all our energies must soon be directed as the final work of this 
institute. One is the training of the intellect, storing it with the largest amount of 
knowledge, producing the brightest examples of culture; the other is the more diffi- 
cult one of attempting to educate in the original and broadest sense of the word—to 
d out a complete manhood. The former is a laborious but simple work; the lat- 
ter is full of difficulty. It is not easy to surround the student with a perfectly bal- 
anced system of influences. The value of every good appliance is limited and ceases 
when not perfectly adjusted to the higher end. The needle, the broom and wash- 
tub, the awl, the plane, and the plow become the allies of the globe, the blackboard, 
and the text-book. * * * Butwhat should bestudied in acourse like this? The 
end of mental training is a discipline and power not derived so much from knowledge 
as from the method and spirit of the student. I think too much stress is laid on the 
importance of choosing one of the great lines of study—the classic or the natural sci- 
ences—and too little upon the vital matter of insight into the life and spirit of that 
which is studied. Latin, as taught by one man, is an inspiration; by another, it is 
famudeery..<* 7" * Our three years’ course, with but little preliminary training, can

not be expected to furnish much. Our students can not become advanced enough in 
that time to be more than superficially acquainted with Latin and Greek; ‘their 
knowledge would rather tend to cultivate their conceit than to fit them for faithful 
educators of their race. The great need of the negro is logic and the subjection of 
feeling to reason; yet in arranging his studies we must exercise his curiosity, his love 
of the marvelous, and his imagination as means of sustaining his enthusiasm. 
An English course, embracing reading and elocution, geography, mathematics, 
history, the sciences, the study of the mother tongue and its literature, the leading 
principles of mental and moral science and political economy, would, I think, make 
up a curriculum that would exhaust the best powers of nineteen-twentieths of those 
who would, for years to come, enter the institute. * * * Of all our work that 
upon the heart is the most important; there can be no question as to the paramount 
necessity of teaching the vital precepts of the Christian faith and of striving to 
awaken a genuine enthusiasm for the higher life that shall be sustained and shall be 
the strong support of the young workers who may go out to be examples of their 
race. * * * J think we may reasonably hope ‘to build up here, on historic 
grounds, an institution that will aid freedmen to escape from the difficulties that 
surround them by affording the best possible agency for their improvement in mind 
and heart, by sending out not pedagogues, but those whose culture shall be upon the 
whole circle of livi ing, and who, with clear insight and strong purpose, will do a quiet 
work that shall make the land purer and better. 
  The trades taught are carpentry and woodworking, harness making, shoemaking, 
the trades of the wheelwright, blacksmith, and tinsmith, house painting, printing, 
tailoring, steam engineering and gas fitting, and the rudiments of the machinist’s trade. 
The normal department employs 19 teachers in the following subjects: Mathe- 
matics, English literature, reading and elocution, history, grammar and composition, 
writing, geography, civil government, political economy, natural philosophy, natural 
history, physiology, and methods of teaching. The senior class receives daily les- 
sons in the art of teaching and members of the class visit the training school daily 
for observation and practice. 
The estimated cost of tuition is $70 a year for each pupil. This does not include 
board, clothing, or books. 
The total enrollment for the year ending July, 1890, was 692—443 men and 259 
women. Of these, 85 men and 46 women were Indians. 
    
NORMAL AND COLLEGIATE INSTITUTE, PETERSBURG. 
The Virginia Normal and Collegiate Institute was established by an act of the gen- 
eral assembly of 1881 and 1882 for the higher education of the colored youth of the 
State and with special reference to the training of teachers. The act of incorpora- 
tion appropriated $100,000 of the proceeds of the sale of the Atlantic, Mississippi 
and Ohio Railroad for the erection of suitable buildings and $20,000 annually for the 
support of the institute. The corner stone of the main building was laid July 4, 
1883, and in October of the same year the institute was opened in the three depart- 
ments—academiec, normal, and preparatory. The extreme length of the building is 
367 feet, and the width through the center building is 126 feet. It is four stories in 
height, including a mansard roof, which contains a lofty observatory. It is calcu- 
lated to accommodate 750 pupils. 
The act of 1881 was supplemented by another, which was approved May 20, 1887, 
which provided ‘‘that the school shall be known as the Virginia Normal and Colle- 
giate Institute, and shall embrace a normal department and a collegiate department, 
and also such professional departments as may be deemed expedient and proper. 
In the normal department shall be taught such branches as are usually taught in 
well-organized normal schools, and in the collegiate department shall be taught such 
branches as are usually embraced in a college curriculum.’’ The act makes the 
institute subject to the government and control of a board of visitors consisting of 
seven members, of whom the superintendent of public instruction is a member and 
ex officio chairman. The other six members are well-qualified colored men, 
appointed by the State board of education, subject to confirmation by the senate. 
 
-P-A-G-E-1184
  9494. EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
The president of the institute and all professors and teachers are required to be col- 
ored persons. The board of visitors are given ample powers for the management 
and control of the institute, and are required to act under the direction and supervi- 
sion of the State board of education, by whom they may be removed for failure to 
perform their duties. The board of visitors has the power to appoint a number of 
State students (colored) equal to twice the number of members of the house of 
delegates, and apportioned in the same manner. Such students must be between 15 
and 25 years of age, and are selected by the superintendents of schools of the respec- 
tive counties and cities. They are required to enter into a written contract to 
engage in teaching school or other educational work. 
Another act of the same assembly provides that the president, professors, and 
teachers of the Virginia Normal and Collegiate Institute shall be required during 
every year to conduct a summer normal school, without additional salary, for the 
benefit of the colored teachers of the public schools and those who expect to become 
teachers; said school to commence not later than the 1st of July and to continue for 
a term of five weeks. Students attending this summer normal school are allowed to 
occupy the institute buildings and to board in like manner as the regular students of 
the institute, the charge for board and lodging not exceeding $2 a week. 
The number of students in the college department (catalogue of 1889) was 11—all 
men; in the college preparatory, 20—17 men and 3 women; in the normal, 295—138 
men and 157 women. The number of ‘‘State students” was 145. The model school 
consists of pupils—about 40 in number—between 6 and 15 years of age, who are taught. 
mainly by the graduating class of the normal department. The normal course is com- 
pleted in three years, and embraces arithmetic, geography, English grammar, United 
States history, reading, drawing, writing, and physiology in the junior year. The 
additional studies for the middle year are physics, algebra, general history, English 
classics, civil government, botany, and bookkeeping. In addition to the studies 
already mentioned, students of the senior year learn chemistry, rhetoric, psychology, 
Latin grammar and reader, school management, methods of teaching, moral science, 
astronomy, and political economy. 
West VIRGINIA. 
STORER COLLEGE, HARPERS FERRY. 
The story of the founding of Storer College, as told by Miss Kate J. Anthony, of 
Providence, R. I., is full of instruction and as interesting as a romance. Only a 
brief sketch can be given here. 
In February, 1867, President T. B. Cheney visited Mr. John Storer, of Sanford, Me., 
in behalf of Bates College. During the conversation he said to Dr. Cheney: ‘‘I have 
determined to give $10,000 to some society which will raise an equal amount toward 
the founding of a school in the South for the benefit of the colored people.”? Dr. 
Cheney pointed out the advantages of Harpers Ferry as a location for such an 
institution and pleaded for time to raise the necessary supplement of $10,000 among 
the friends of the colored people in the Free Baptist Church, of which he was a 
minister. Mr. Storer extended the time to the Ist of January, 1868. It was Mr. 
Storer’s wish that the institution should eventually become a college, and be so 
chartered; with a proviso that it be operated as a normal school or seminary till the 
endowment fund should be adequate for college purposes, and that it be open to 
both sexes without distinction of race or color. The greater part of the necessary 
amount was raised during the year, and Harpers Ferry was settled on as the loca- 
tion most advantageous for the school. Dr. Cheney received hearty sympathy and 
encouragement and a promise of $6,000 from the Freedmen’s Bureau. The Govern- 
ment had four large brick mansions on Camp Hill, and in one of these—the Lock- 
wood House—the school was opened on the 2d of October, 1867. Finally, through 
the earnest support of Mr. Fessenden in the Senate and of General Garfield in the

  House, the four buildings, with 7 acres of land, became the property of the ii 
tion. But for Government aid and the fostering care of the Freedmen’s Bureau, 
the college could not have been maintained. Before the time had expired for the 
collection of the additional $10,000, Mr. Storer died, and Senator Fessenden, with 
whom Mr. Storer’s bequest had been deposited, decided that he could not legally 
transfer it until the conditions were legally fulfilled. Double the necessary amount 
had been pledged, but pledges could not be received as equivalent to cash. On the 
last day of grace the executive committee was nearly $3,000 short, and this amount 
had to be raised before midnight. ‘‘There are emergencies,’’ says Miss Anthony, 
“when men wrest success from seeming impossibility. We can not now enter into 
details, but the requirements were met and Storer College saved, though that day is 
often referred to as the black Wednesday.”’ 
The next important step was to obtain a college charter. After much opposition 
this legislation was secured from the legislature by a majority of 1. 
The school grew rapidly. It began in October with 19 pupils; in January it num- 
bered 36, and in March 75. Lockwood House proved inadequate for the increasing 
numbers, and one of the other buildings was fitted for chapel and school purposes, 
and opened in 1869. In 1882 a new school building was erected with money raised 
from church auxiliaries and young people’s societies in the North. 
It is unpleasant to remember, and yet it would be unwise to forget, the opposition 
which such schools met in the early postbellum days. Let Miss Anthony tell the 
story, ‘‘with considerable abridgment by the present editor:”’ 
We have mentioned opposition. Perhaps it is not well to dwell much upon this 
in these better days, but some reference is requisite to a true comprehension of what 
has been achieved. Shortly before the normal school was established a teacher in 
the vicinity wrote home: ‘‘It is unusual for me to go to the post-office without being 
hooted at, and twice I have been stoned on the streets at noonday.”’ 
It was considered necessary that our lady teachers have a military escort as they 
went from place to place. But when Storer College was set in their midst prejudice 
and opposition intensified to fever heat. * * * We can only hint at facts; the 
thrilling incidents and experiences of those early days would fill a volume. Naught 
but an unfaltering trust, an undaunted courage, and noble self-sacrifice could volun- 
tarily endure and cope with these adverse elements, and such was the spirit that 
permeated and upheld our brave workers. 
The change in public sentiment is indeed marked and wonderlul. To-day the 
inhabitants of Harpers Ferry hold a true interest and even a pride in the college. 
Some of its old opponents are now numbered among its most devoted friends. And 
no person in the community is held in higher honor or warmer esteem than Mr. 
Brackett [principal], once of all men most hated and despised.! 
The college is (1892) organized in three departments—academic, normal, and pre- 
paratory. By the last catalogue on hand there were 47 pupils in the academic, 180 
in the normal, and 68 in the preparatory. The whole number of different pupils was 
273. The normal course covers three years; it is mainly a grammar-school course, 
but instruction in the theory and art of teaching is given in the third year. The 
State of West Virginia provides annually for eighteen scholarships, including tuition 
and the use of books. The school gives eighteen scholarships. 
The industrial department was commenced in 1887, originating in a donation of 
$2,000 from Mrs. Mary L. De Wolf, of Illinois, made in memory of her deceased 
husband, whose name it bears. There is also a sewing department for girls.”

of teachers for the colored people of the State of North Carolina and elsewhere in 
the United States.’’ The first trustees, 11 in number, were the bishop, 5 clergymen 
and 5 laymen of the diocese of North Carolina. ‘‘ The board, thus constituted, filling 
its own vacancies and perpetuating itself, the religious character of the school and its 
relation to the church as one of its institutions were amply secured.’’ In 1869 the 
board received a bequest by the will of the Rey. Charles Avery, amounting to $25,000, 
upon condition that it should be securely invested and the interest used for promot- 
ing the education and elevation of the colored people of the United States. The 
Freedmen’s Bureau gave to the school $6,248 to be expended in buildings. In 1870, 
and subsequently, the school received from the Barry fund gifts amounting to $26,716. 
The last available catalogue of the school states that its object is threefold: ‘To 
afford young men and women of the colored race superior advantages for obtaining 
a thorough academic education, to train and equip teachers for efficient service, and 
to prepare young men for the holy ministry.”’ 
There are four buildings belonging to the institution—the main school building, 
the boarding hall for the female students (called the Smith building after the founder 
of the school), and residences for the principal and the vice-principal. The main 
school building is of brick, four stories high, 85 feet front by 44 feet deep. 
Candidates for admission to the lowest grade are required to be able to read and 
write and to perform the four fundamental operations of arithmetic in whole num- 
bers. The normal course extends through four years. In the first year, in addition 
to the common-school studies, physical geography, natural philosophy, and book- 
keeping are taught; in the second year, algebra, geometry, rhetoric, physiology, his- 
tory of England, civil government, and the art and science of teaching; in the third 
year, geometry, astronomy, chemistry, psychology, general history, and the art and 
science of teaching; in the fourth year, trigonometry, geology, English literature, 
political economy, moral science, and the history of pedagogy. Vocal music and 
English composition are continued through the whole course. Instruction in dress- 
making is given to all the girls in the boarding department, and there is a carpen- 
ter shop for boys. The number of students’ in the several departments, by the 
catalogue referred to, was as follows:

STATE NORMAL SCHOOL AT FAYETTEVILLE, 
The general assembly of North Carolina passed an act, which was ratified on the 
9th of March, 1877, for the establishment of normal schools. The first section pro- 
vides for a normal school for white teachers in connection with the State university, 
and appropriates $2,000 a year for its support. The second section enacts ‘‘that it 
shall be lawful for the State board of education to establish a normal school, at any 
place they may deem most suitable, either in connection with some one of the col- 
ored schools of high grade in the State, or otherwise, for the teaching and training 
of young men of the colored race, from the age of 15 to 25 years, for teachers in the

to draw upon the treasury for an amount not to exceed $2,000 annually for the years 
1877 and 1878.7 An amendment was passed in 1879 authorizing the admission of 
females and the establishment of a preparatory department in connection with the 
normal school. The appropriations for the years 1877 and 1878 were by the same 
act directed to be paid annually until the general assembly should otherwise provide. 
In accordance with this legislation the State board of education established at 
Fayetteville a normal school for the training of teachers for the colored schools of- 
the State. The school was held in a large and commodious building provided by the 
colored people of the city. The attendance for the first term was 58; for the second 
term, 67; for the third term, 85. In 1890 the attendance had increased to 145, of 
whom 75 were in the normal department proper. The course of study includes the 
usual grammar-school branches in English and mathematics, with Latin and first 
lessons in Greek and Wickersham’s ‘‘Methods of Teaching.” All students are 
required to give a written pledge to engage in teaching in the public schools of the 
State for at least three years, but it has been found that this pledge was hard to keep; 
many of the students engaged in teaching during the vacation and many others were 
anxious to do so, but could get no employment.    
   
  STATE NORMAL SCHOOL, SALISBURY: 
This is one of the four schools established by the legislature of North Carolina in 
1881 for educating and training colored. teachers in the arts and methods of impart- 
ing instruction in the several branches of study taught in the public free schools of 
the State. The course of instruction embraces four years of three terms each— 
preparatory, junior, middle, and senior. Methods of teaching and kindred subjects 
have no definite place in the printed curriculum, but ‘‘map drawing, object lessons, 
composition, and lectures on pedagogics’’ are given during the entire year.. The 
subjects of the senior year are Latin, Greek, algebra, geometry, astronomy, chemistry, 
zoology, botany, history, rhetoric, and civil government. Boarding, lodging, fuel, 
and lights are given to young women at the institution boarding house at $6 per 
month. The number of students in the normal department is 21.1 
STATE NORMAL SCHOOL, PLYMOUTH. 
The State Normal School for colored teachers at Plymouth, N. C., was established 
in 1881 by an act of the general assembly appropriating a small sum for that pur- 
pose. Applicants are required to be at least 15 years of age and to possess a knowl- 
edge of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and also to be able ‘“‘to 
read pretty well in Holmes’s Fourth Reader.’’ Tuition is free to all students who 
are residents of the State. There is a three-years’ course of study in addition toa 
preparatory year. The junior and middle years are confined principally to common- 
school studies, with algebra, moral science, botany, and civil government. The 
senior year adds English and American literature, general history, rhetoric, logic, 
geometry, bookkeeping, natural philosophy, political economy, Latin, and pedagogics. 
The new building is a large and beautiful structure and will accommodate 250 
students. 
Boarding in private families costs from $5 to $8 a month. 
The number of students enrolled in 1890, exclusive of the preparatory class, was 
87, of whom 5 were seniors. The faculty consisted of the principal and two pro- 
fessors.”

the education of teachers for the colored race. It is hoped that this school will help 
to furnish teachers properly equipped for their work. In many of the eastern coun- 
ties the proportion of the school fund assigned to the colored people had been allowed 
to lapse for the lack of competent colored teachers. Rooms were provided and com- 
fortably furnished in the graded-school building belonging to the city, and in the 
fourth year the number of students in all the departments was 139. Only 15 of them, 
however, could be fairly reckoned as normalites. An industrial department has 
recently been added; the boys are taught carpentry and painting, and the girls 
needlework, laundering, and cooking.!

AVERY NORMAL INSTITUTE, CHARLESTON. 
The Avery Institute was opened on the Ist of October, 1865, in the State Normal 
School building in Charleston, which was offered for the purposes of the school by 
Gen. Rufus Saxton, assistant commissioner of the Freedmen’s Bureau. The school 
commenced with a corps of 20 teachers and 1,000 pupils, who occupied all the avail- 
able space in the building. The school was removed from the normal building in 
September, 1866, and transferred to the military hall in Wentworth street, which 
could only accommodate 800 pupils. In 1868 it was removed to a new building on 
Bull street and its name changed from the Saxton School to the Avery Institute, in 
honor of the philanthropist who had given a large part of his fortune for the benefit 
of the colored race. The Rey. F. L. Cardozo, the first principal of the school, was 
aided the first year by a corps of 20 teachers, 10 Northern whites and 10 Southern 
colored teachers. The third school year, there being but 400 scholars and the school 
assuming the position and condition of a normal school, there were but eight teachers 
besides the principal, and all from the North. 
The building to which the school was transferred in 1868 was erected at a cost of 
$25,000 by the American Missionary Association, by which the property is owned 
and the school supported. 
The total enrollment of pupils for the year ending June, 1891, was 395, 156 being 
in the normal department. The normal course of study is academic for the first and 
third years. The second and fourth years include school economy and methods 
and science of education. The college preparatory course adds Latin and Greek to 
the full normal course. 
The design of the school is stated to be ‘‘mainly professional; that is, to prepare 
in the best possible manner the pupils for the work of organizing and teaching public 
schools.”? It consists of five subnormal grades and four normal department classes. 
Parallel with the normal course is the college preparatory course, which covers four 
years. There is no boarding department, and the patronage, therefore, is mostly 
local.? 
SCHOFIELD NORMAL AND INDUSTRIAL INSTITUTE. 
This school was established in 1868 by Martha Schofield, under the Germantown 
branch of the Freedmen’s Union Commission. The object of the school is not only 
to impart book learning to the boys and girls, but to teach them the everyday duties 
of life, so as to fit them for filling honorable and useful positions in the home, in the 
church, in the schoolroom, and in the community. The course of study may be 
completed in four years. In the first three years the ordinary grammar school 
studies are pursued; in the fourth or senior year geometry, natural and moral phi- 
losophy, ¢ivil government, rhetoric, methods of teaching, and school economy. The 
principal industries are printing, carpentry, cobbling, sewing, and painting. The

expenses of the school are about $5,000 a year, of which $500 come from the John 
F, Slater fund and two-thirds of the remainder from voluntary contributions. 
In 1890 there were 360 pupils, of whom 40 were in the normal department. The 
teaching corps consisted of the principal and seven assistants—four in the literary 
and three in the industrial department. 
The Rey. A. D. Mayo visited this school in 1886, and writes: ‘‘I regard it in some 
respects the best of its kind I have seen in the South. Unlike the majority of this 
class of institutions, the Schofield School has not come up by the backing of a reli- 
gious denomination, but has been established by the devoted and energetic services 
of its founder, Miss Martha Schofield, and her associate, William T. Rodenbach, 
continued through seventeen years.’’! 
GEORGIA. 
ATLANTA UNIVERSITY. 
The beginning of the Atlanta University was made by the American Missionary 
Association, aided by the Freedmen’s Bureau. The original design was to establish 
one central institution for higher education, beginning with normal and preparatory 
departments, which were to grow into a college and finally into a university. A 
charter was obtained in 1867, and the first building was completed in 1869—a sub- 
stantial four-story brick building with boarding accommodations for 40 women. 
The number of students the first year was 89. The legislature of 1870 voted an 
annual appropriation of $8,000, a part of which was used in erecting a new build- 
ing similar to the first. In 1871 a wing was added which accommodated 40 addi- 
tional pupils. The legislature of 1872 refused to grant any aid, and the school became 
dependent upon the American Missionary Association and private benevolence. 
The legislature of 1873 passed almost unanimously an act making an annual appro- 
priation of $8,000 to this institution. The appropriation was made on condition that 
the money should not be paid till a corimission consisting of certain members of 
the faculty of the University of Georgia had approved the plan of the trustees for its 
expenditure, and the further condition that there should be educated, free of tuition, 
one pupil for every member of the house of representatives, to be nominated by the 
members. In 1871 one young man graduated from the preparatory department and 
entered Oberlin College, where he was graduated in 1875. In 1872 another left the 
freshmen class and entered West Point. In 1873, 1874, and 1875 a class of four was 
graduated each year from the higher normal department. In 1876 the whole num- 
ber of students was 240, of whom 68 were in the higher normal department. In 1879 
the university received an official visit from a committee of the State board of 
examiners. The following extracts from their report may be interesting: 
    Your committee were impressed with the fact that the colored race, whether of pure 
or mixed blood, are capable of receiving the education usually given at such institu- 
tions. Whether they will be able to build, and build usefully, upon the foundation 
thus laid remains to be seen. * * * Referring to the very able report of your 
committee of last year, your present committee desire to express their gratification 
that it has apparently been heeded by those in immediate control of the university. 
The objectionable sectional books have disappeared from the library, and your com- 
mittee are assured not only that ‘‘those Northern teachers do not try to alienate 
their pupils from old masters and homes and from their native State,’’ but that every 
effort is used to counteract any tendency toward such alienation. * * * Your 
committee recommend that the State commissioners of the university be instructed 
to examine the text-books used with power to reject such as may prove objectionable; 
and it is believed that the faculty will heartily approve such a plan, as your com- 
mittee feel satisfied that such books (if there be such now in use) bave been adopted 
with a perfect unconsciousness of any objectionable feature. Your committee so 
think because free and candid conversations with the president and various members 
of the faculty have convinced them that the faculty are animated by a sincere desire

to elevate the colored race upon its own merits, are free from any leveling tendencies, 
and recognize the fact that their pupils’ true interests are to live in harmony and 
accord with their late owners, now, as in the past, their best friends. 
The report of the State board of examiners for the following year states “‘that they 
were much gratified to learn that the future of the institution is very flattering. It 
- is your committee’s opinion that the State has acted wisely in her appropriation to 
the Atlanta University, and that a continuance of it is to her best interests.’’ 
The State appropriation of $8,000 a year was continued until January, 1888. The 
following extract from the report of the board of visitors in 1887 will show the prob- 
able reason why the appropriation was discontinued: 
We find in attendance at the Atlanta University a number of white students of vari- 
ous ages and both sexes, most of them having more or less connection with the mem- 
bers of the faculty or other officers, and one at least entirely unconnected with the 
flicials. We mention these relations of the white students, not with the intention 
of suggesting that there is any real difference between allowi ing the attendance of 
childn en of the faculty and children of those other than the faculty, but in order that 
all the facts may be known. We have ascertained by conference with members of 
the faculty that it is their avowed intention to receive al: white children who apply 
for admission into the school; and we interpret this, in connection with certain pub- 
lications of theirs, as a desire to break down the existing barriers against the coedu- 
cation of the two races. We desire to say that we regard this practice as not only 
intrinsically wrong, but as being in this case an improper use of the money appropri- 
ated by the State to this institution. In every enactment which the legislature has 
made upon this subject since and including the year of 1874, as well as in the consti- 
tutional delegation of authority to make it, the appropriation has been made for the 
benefit of the colored race alone. Indeed, ‘the act of 1874 in terms devotes the sum of 
$8,000 per annum solely to that people, and that act is in the nature of a contract by 
which they receive that sum in lieu of other moneys. It occurs to us that the admis- 
sion of white children to a participation in the benefits of this appropriation, aside 
from any violation of the general policy of the State, is in this case a misuse of public 
moneys. 
       
  The catalogue from which this extract is taken (1887-88) contains the following 
note: 
Three facts may be properly cited as illuminating this passage in the report of the 
board of visitors: 
First. Only one-fourth of the money for the current expenses of the school came 
from the State, the remainder being largely furnished by the gifts of benevolent 
friends of education. 
Second. Only 7 children, to whom the objections of the committee would apply, 
were in attendance out of more than 400, of whom 1 was the child ofa m 
of the American Missionary Association residing i in the city, and 6 were ch 
teachers in the school, some of whom were reciting to their own parents. 
Third. The class of children to which objection was made was in attendance when 
the law under which the committee acted was passed thirteen years before; and, to 
a very limited extent, has been in attendance eyer since, with the full knowledge of 
all parties and with no objection or criticism.   
   
The whole number of pupils in attendance in 1891 was 596, representing sixty-two 
counties in Georgia. There were in the—

The normal school includes, besides the usual high-school branches in English 
and science, ‘‘School economy and primary methods”’ in the junior class and peda-

The mechanical course covers three years, two of wood working and one of metal 
working; it is required of all boys above the third grade, in addition to their regular 
studies in other courses. Seven and a half hours each week are given to this work.

Boys are also taught some of the principles of farming and gardening, and attention 
is given to the raising and care of stock. The girls are taught various branches of 
household science, such as plain sewing, dressmaking, cooking, and laundry work, 
under experienced teachers. There is a large and well-appointed printing office in 
the principal University building, in which instruction is given to optional classes, 
both of boys and girls, without extra charge.*

STATE NORMAL COLLEGE FOR COLORED STUDENTS, TALLAHASSEE. 
The constitution of the State of Florida, adopted in 1885, requires, Article XIT, 
section 14, that the legislature at its first session shall provide for the establishment, 
maintenance, and management of such normal schools, not to exceed two, as the 
interests of the public education may demand, In accordance with this constitu- 
tional requirement, the legislature of 1887 passed an act establishing a normal school 
for white teachers at De Fuaniak Springs and a normal school for colored teachers 
at Tallahassee, similar in all respects to the normal school for white teachers and 
subject to the same supervision and direction by the State board of education. The 
same annual amount ($4,000) was appropriated to meet the current expenses of 
each school. 
The school was opened in 1887 in a building erected for the purpose, a comfortable 
and well-arranged structure, furnished with the most improved furniture and appa- 
ratus. Itis organized in two departments—preparatory and normal. The normal 
course covers a period of two years. Graduates receive the degree of licentiate of 
instruction and a teacher’s certificate of the first grade, good for life. The normal 
course for the junior year includes algebra, geometry, Latin, general history, 
physics, and English composition; and in the senior year, astronomy, moral and 
mental philosophy, science of government, theory and practice of teaching, and a 
continuation of Latin and history. Candidates for admission are required to be 16 
years of age or more, to be thoroughly grounded in all the common-school branches 
of study, to have a rudimentary knowledge of Latin, algebra, and general history, 
and to possess the requisite moral and physical qualifications. 
A joint committee of the legislature visited the school officially in May, 1889, and 
made a very favorable report, from which the following extracts are taken: 
Though less than two years have passed since this institution was established, yet 
even now the wisdom of such an undertaking is demonstrated by the results. Much 
of the work at present is of necessity academic in its nature, for the reason that many 
of the students have not had the opportunity to acquire that thorough and intelligent 
knowledge of the branches to be taught which is absolutely essential to the successful 
teacher. * * * The preparatory department is devoted principally to a review of 
the common English branches, conducted in the improved methods of normal instruc- 
tion. It thus serves the double purpose of a training school and an academic course. 
The normal department is occupied with the higher branches of education and ped- 
agogics. * * * The needs of the school we find to be: First, dormitories, where 
students from outside the town can be accommodated, protected, and controlled; and, 
second, an industrial department, where a knowledge of tool craft can be given to the 
teachers, who in turn can give to the youth of the common schools such manual train- 
ing as will enable them to become intelligent and skillful producers of wealth. 
The number of students enrolled the first year was 52, and the second year 55.°

character, and to sign a pledge to teach in the colored common schools of Kentucky 
a period equal to twice the time spent as a pupil in the normal school. In addition 
to these requirements, every applicant for admission must hold a teachers’ certificate 
or a certificate of graduation from a common school or pass an examination by the 
faculty on the subjects of instruction prescribed for common schools and attain an 
average of not less than 65 per cent, but on no subject less than 50 per cent. The 
school numbered 58 students in 1890, under the care of a principal and three assist- 
ants. Tuition is free to all colored residents of Kentucky who fulfill the required 
conditions; to nonresidents the tuition fee is $2 per month.? 
‘TENNESSEE. 
FISK UNIVERSITY. 
The American Missionary Association opened a school among the escaping fugitives 
that took shelter under the guns of Fortress Monroe only five months after the war 
began. This was the first freedmen’s school in the United States, but missionaries 
and teachers followed up the march of the Army and schools quickly took the place 
of encampments. The first freedmen’s school in Nashville was established by the 
Rey. J. G. McKee, of the United Presbyterian Church, in October, 1863, but his 
school was abandoned when city schools were opened to colored children. The Fisk 
School was opened in January, 1866, and took its name from General Fisk, who was 
chief of the Freedmen’s Bureau for Tennessee and the adjoining States. The school 
was then and is still supported by the American Missionary Association of New 
York. In August, 1867, a charter was obtained for Fisk University, with the expec- 
tation that. it would grow with the growing wants of the colored people, and the 
expectation was not disappointed. In 1871 the old hospital buildings, which the 
school had used for five years, were so sadly out of repair as to be incapable of fur- 
ther service. At this crisis George L. White, a music teacher in the institution, con- 
ceived the idea of training a company of colored singers and carrying them through 
the Northern States on a concert tour. For some months he made scarcely money 
enough to meet current expenses, but at length the tide turned, his troupe became 
famous, and at the end of their first concert season they had netted $20,000. Another 
season brought in $20,000 more. The troupe then made a tour shrough Great Britain 
and returned with $50,000. Thus Jubilee Hall was sung into existence, and was dedi- 
cated on the 1st of January, 1876. 
The building is situated about 1 mile northwest of Nashville, and the surrounding 
grounds, belonging'to the University, cover 25 acres. The greater part of the work 
of construction was done by colored men connected with the University. 
At the dedication service Gen, Clinton B. Fisk made a very interesting address, 
from which room can be found only for a few sentences: 
It is a decade since many of us, who share in this day’s joys, participated in the 
inauguration of Fisk School, established in yonder vacated army barracks, under the 
auspices of the American Missionary Association by two of its most faithful, sagacious 
representatives, Rey. E. M. Cravath and Rey. E. P. Smith, who, after a survey of 
many inviting fields, decided that here, in this central city of the South, they would 
plant a university for the higher education of the freed people. It was the day of 
small things; and to an observer who did not with prophetic soul scan the future, 
the idea that a university should be the outgrowth of the beginning of ten years ago 
was absurd. Let us not despise the day of small things. When a young clergyman, 
centuries ago, landed from the Old World on the shores of New England in search 
of health, and failing to obtain it exchanged both the Old and the New World for 
Heaven, and in dying bequeathed £400 sterling for the founding of a college, he 
little knew how well he was building, and that Harvard would become a household 
word the wide world over. And when a few poor ministers of the gospel in Con- 
necticut brought together each a few books and said, ‘‘ We give these for the founding

of a college,”’ they had no conception that their act was the first step in the creation 
of Yale. * * * The history of the rise and progress, successes, disappvuintments, 
and triumphs of Fisk University would reveal a story replete with illustrations of 
heroic Christian faith and a sublime courage which knows no such word as fail. The 
demand from every section of the country inhabited by the freed people for educa- 
tional facilities exceeded the ability of the American Missionary Association and 
kindred organizations to supply. * * * Year by year, after the undertaking of 
ten years since, grew upon us the perplexing problem of obtaining the means to pur- 
chase a new site and erect the permanent initial building of Fisk University. When, 
through decay of the old buildings and the urgent demands for increased facilities, 
the solution of the problem became imperative, there was found one man equal to 
the emergency. 
The son of a village blacksmith who, from limited advantages of culture, had risen 
to the position of a successful country school teacher, a brave and gallant soldier of 
the army of the Union, and a most faithful staff officer in my own military family, 
became the man of all work in the hour of our greatest need; and to no human agence: 
nor to all other human agencies combined are the triumphs of this glad hour so mach 
indebted as to George L. White. He conceived the idea of coining the slave melodies 
of the old plantation and the camp meeting into gold and silver wherewith to pur- 
chase this commanding site and upon it erect Jubilee Hall. How well do I remem- 
ber when this good brother wrote me at my home in St. Louis and asked me to loan 
him $300 to take his singers north of the Ohio River. I wrote him not to think of 
such a thing; that he would bring disgrace upon us all, and told him to stay at home 
and do his work. He wrote back that he trusted in God and not in General Fisk. 
Next we see him marching onward with his little band. Reaching the city of Cin- 
cinnati destitute, he went down to our old friend Halstead of the Commercial, and 
said to him, ‘‘ You are a friend of General Fisk; I have some students of his who are 
going to sing Sunday morning at such a church. I have no money to pay for the 
advertisement, so you will please say in your paper that they are here.”” This was 
on Friday, and they were to sing on Sunday. Saturday morning’s paper announced 
that General Fisk’s Negro Minstrels from Tennessee were in the city and would sing 
at such a church next morning at 10.30 o’clock, and advised everybody to go. 
Everybody did go, as it was something really wonderful to witness a negro minstrel 
performancein a church on Sunday. The story of the Jubilee Singers fills a volume. 
In America they conquered social prejudices, and by their modest, Christian demeanor, 
which they have so happily retained, commanded the respect and generous patron- 
age of the best and highest in the land. Beyond the sea, they have twice received 
paeeneye vy oleomns and God-speed from the noblest and best of England, Scotland, and 
Treland. 
The first class was graduated from the college department in May, 1875, ten years 
after the founding of the Fisk School, 2 young men and 2 young women receiving 
the degree of B. A. The same year 3 were graduated from the normal department. 
The normal faculty is composed of the president, Rey. E. M. Cravath, and 7 
instructors. The number of students in this department in 1890 was 67. The total 
attendance in all departments was 523, representing nearly all the States of the 
South and Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Nebraska, and Minnesota. The normal curricu- 
lum is in two divisions, elementary and advanced, each occupying two years: First 
year, Latin, algebra, English history, and physical geography; second year, in addi- 
tion to the above, arithmetic, English literature, bookkeeping, physiology, school 
economy, and primary methods; third year, ancient history, rhetoric, plane and 
solid geometry, practice teaching; fourth year, review of arithmetic, grammar, geog- 
raphy and history, mental science, moral philosophy, astronomy, geology, physics, 
practice teaching. 
Industrial training is not made a prominent feature, but all students who board in 
the University are required to devote one hour every day to such forms of labor as 
may be required of them. By a special appropriation from the John F. Slater fund, 
a printing office has been properly furnished, and the art of printing is taught to 15 
young men every year. 
Systematic instruction in woodworking, according to the most approved modern 
methods, is given to young men, the course lasting for three years. Nursing, cook-

CENTRAL TENNESSEE COLLEGE, NASHVILLE, 
At the close of the war, in 1865, the condition of the emancipated slaves attracted 
the attention of patriots, philanthropists, and Christians, North and Seuth. Ali the 
leading religious denominations of the North entered this field of missionary work. 
The Missionary Society of the M. E. Church appropriated $10,000 to establish a 
school for freedmen in the South, and placed the money under the direction of 
Bishop D. W. Clark, who purchased a church building in Nashville and opened a 
school under Rey. O. O. Knight as principal and three colored women as assistants. 
The school was composed of scholars of all ages and sizes—grandparents and grand- 
children were in the same class. They were poorly clad, and mostly homeless wan- 
derers from the plantation. They found shelter in the army barracks, in abandoned 
houses, in cellars or garrets, in stables or other outhouses. Yet, in the midst of this 
destitution, they were hungry for education. Local preachers were taught some 
Biblical truths while they were studying the primer and the spelling book. This was 
the beginning of the theological department. 
This school was chartered in May, 1866, by the legislature as the Central Tennessee 
College. The charter contains a provision that “ not less than two-thirds of the mem- 
bers of the board of trustees shall at all times be members in regular standing in the 
Methodist Episcopal Church in the United States of America.” The trustees are 
authorized to confer such literary, professional, and scientific degrees and diplomas 
as are usual in such institutions, with the proviso that ‘‘ they shall at all times main- 
tain a biblical department for the education of young men who have been properly 
approved as candidates for the Christian ministry.’’ Medical, law, and other depart- 
ments were also organized subsequently. 
It is said that in 1866 over 800 pupils were enrolled, but in September, 1867, the 
school opened with a small attendance, as a fee of $1 per month was charged, and the 
public free schools for colored children were opened for the first time in Nashyille. 
But with the smaller attendance the character of the students began to change forthe 
better, and the demand for teachers being very great, the normal department was 
organized in harmony with the main object of the school, which was to educate 
teachers and preachers. The first catalogue was issued for the year of 1869-70. It 
reports an enrollment of 241, 9 in the preparatory, 17 in the theological, 76 in the 
academic, and the remainder in the intermediate course. In 1872 the buildings would 
no longer accommodate the students. To meet this emergency a band of students of 
the college, known as the Tennesseeans, sung through the North so successfully that 
$18,000 were raised, and a new building erected, which was occupied at the opening 
of the school year of 1875. During this year the medical department was opened in 
the basement of the new building. The dental department was opened in 1886, and 
the department of pharmacy in 1889. The John F. Slater industrial department was 
opened in 1884 for the practice of carpentry and printing. A blacksmith and wagon- 
making shop was opened in 1888, and a tin shop in 1889. In October, 1890, the 
mechanic-art shop was dedicated to the training of young men for useful work in 
wood, iron, brass, and steel, in the manufacure of steam engines and scientific and 
philosophical apparatus. This was the first shop of the kind opened to colored youth 
in this country. 
Since the opening of the free schools in Nashville, the number in attendance has 
increased with great regularity every year from 150 in 1869-to 613 in 1891. The 
whole number of students, reckoning from the beginning of the school in 1865, is 
about 6,060. The number of graduates in the different departments is, junior nor-

LE MOYNE NORMAL INSTITUTE, MEMPHIS. 
In 1870 Dr. F. Julius Le Moyne, of Washington, Pa., gave $20,000 to the American 
Missionary Association for the purpose of founding an English school for colored 
youth at Memphis, Tenn. From this fund the necessary buildings were erected, 
leaving about $11,000 as an endowment fund. The school was opened in September, 
1871, and has since been sustained by the association and this endowment fund. For 
the first two years the school was under the immediate care of Prof. J. H. Barnum, 
formerly of Oberlin. In October, 1873, Mr. Barnum was succeeded by D. E. Cottle, 
of Connectieut. Soon after Mr. Cottle assumed the duties of principal, yellow fever 
began its ravages inthe city. The teachers remained at their work, although directed 
by the association to leave the city if they thought best. They were unwilling to 
desert their work in the hour of danger, but early in November Mrs. Cottle was 
attacked and died. Mr. Cottle survived her only a week, and the school was closed 
till January, 1874. 
The school has had several names. It started as ‘‘The Le Moyne Normal and 
Commercial School.” It was afterwards ‘‘The Le Moyne Normal School,” and it is 
now known as ‘‘The Le Moyne Normal Institute.” The school was designed to 
accommodate 250 pupils, but it became necessary to enlarge it from time to time, 
until now over 500 pupils are in regular attendance, It is declared to be the purpose 
and plan of the school to give a thoroughly practical English education, with special 
normal training for those who intend to engage in teaching. The normal course is 
in two divisions, elementary and advanced. ‘The advanced course includes plane 
geometry, astronomy, physics, geology, history (sacred and profane), mental and 
moral philosophy, pedagogics, and practice teaching. In addition to these studies 
there is a special professional or teachers’ course, of which the following is an outline:   
1. (a) A knowledge of the human mind and its application to the work of educa- 
tion. (6) The order and conditions of the development and growth of mental 
faculties. (c) General principles of education. (d) Methods of school government 
and organization. 
2. Object and aims of edueation. 
3. Motives to mental activity. 
4. Laws that govern attention, and the conditions of its proper training. 
Each student-teacher receives thirty-two weeks of practice teaching under the 
direction of a critic teacher. 
Manual training or industrial education has an important place in the course of 
study, both in the normal and in the lower grades. ‘The girls have a systematic 
course of lessons in plain needlework of all kinds and some fancy work. Inthe 
eighth school year they have daily recitations in the theory of household economy 
and in cooking. Girls of the ninth year do practical work in the experimenial 
kitchen. In addition to daily lessons of forty minutes, the class has actual practice 
in cooking certain days of the week, when the class time is extended to two hours. 
On each practice day four dishes are usually prepared by the girls under the super- 
vision of the regular instructor. 
Provision has been made to give the boys some practice in the use of wood- 
working tools and in typesetting and printing. For the woodworking classes 
fourteen benches and as many sets of carpenters’ tools are provided. The shop is 
also furnished with a number of lathes and other foot-power machinery. The main 
object of this work is to train the eye and the hand of the pupils, and to make them 
perfectly familiar with the construction, care, and use of the tools. ‘The entire time

of a special instructor is required in this department, as is also the case in the print- 
ting office and in the girls’ department of industrial instruction. 
The total number of students for the year in the normal department, including 
two preparatory classes, is 158. In the grammar and primary grades there are 450 
pupils. 
The faculty consists of the principal, A. J. Steele, with 16 instructors and assistants. 
NORMAL DEPARTMENT OF ROGER WILLIAMS UNIVERSITY. 
On the 13th of February, 1883, the Nashville Normal and Theological Institute 
was incorporated under the laws of the State of Tennessee as The Roger Williams 
University, and trustees were chosen under the direction of the board of the Ameri- 
can Baptist Home Mission Society, by which the university is chiefly sustained. 
Candidates for admission are required to be able to read in the fourth reader. 
Young men and women, whose abilities and characters give promise of special use- 
fulness, and whose circumstances render it necessary, are furnished with help suffi- 
cient to enable them to remain in school. In order to receive this assistance a 
student must commend himself to the faculty by diligence and progress in his studies, 
by freedom from bad habits, and by the manifestation of a good conscience and a 
worthy Christian character. The State of Tennessee has established for ‘‘children 
of Tennessee of African descent” fifty normal scholarships worth $50 each, and 
the Roger Williams University is one of the schools which students may attend 
and enjoy this bounty. A State scholarship gives a student in this university 
his board and tuition for six months. State normal pupils ‘‘must be at least 17 
years of age, of irreproachable moral character, of gentlemanly or lady-like habits, 
presumed good health, declared intention to make teaching a profession, and inten- 
tion to teach at least two years in the public schools.’? Applicants for scholarships 
are examined in spelling, reading, penmanship, English grammar, rhetoric, geog- 
raphy, arithmetic, algebra, bookkeeping, physiology, United States history, elements 
of geology, and elements of agriculture, with the understanding, however, that, if 
no applicants are able to satisfy all these requirements, those who come nearest to 
the standard will be appointed. 
In 1891 there were in the theological department 21 students; in the college 
department, 17; in the college preparatory, 25; in the normal department, 39. The 
total number of registered students was 226—101 men and 125 women—coming from 
12 different States, but a majority from Tennessee. The normal course provides for 
the teaching of ‘‘pedagogics’”’ in the senior year only, where it takes its place with 
10 other studies. 
FREEDMEN’S NORMAL INSTITUTE, MARYVILLE. 
This schoo! is under the management of the Religious Society of Friends. It was 
opened in 1876. In 1877 it had an enrollment of 125 students. It is claimed that 
“those who go out from this institution to teach have been so thoroughly trained by 
actual class and school work done by themselves, under the supervision of the prin- 
cipal, that their own schools will compare favorably with those taught by our best 
modern teachers.”’ 
Three courses of instruction are provided—a teacher’s elementary course of two 
years, a teacher’s advanced course of one year, and a classical course of three years. 
In the last available catalogue there were 68 students registered in the first year of the 
elementary course, three in the second year, two in the advanced course, and three 
in the classical course. A great majority of the pupils are in the preparatory and 
primary departments. The institute is conducted by the principal with 10 assistants. 
The theory and practice of teaching finds a place in the elementary but not in the 
advanced course.

George Sturge, an English Friend, gave to the Yearly Meeting of Friends for New 
England a fund, the income of which enables the committee having charge of the 
Freedmen’s Normal Institute to reduce the expenses of students. Forty students for 
the fall term and 60 for the spring term are admitted to the normal class and receive 
75 cents per week toward their expenses. Such students are expected to remain 
until they are qualified to teach in the common schools, and to teach in such schools 
for as many weeks as they were in the normal class receiving the benefit of the Sturge 
fund. 
ALABAMA. 
STATE NORMAL AND INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL, HUNTSVILLE. 
The State Normal and Industrial School at Huntsville, Ala., was organized in 
May, 1875. It had then only two teachers, an income of $1,000 from the State, and 
no. property. The State appropriation was raised in 1878 to $2,000. For the first 
two years the school occupied a little church and some small rented houses. By the 
practice of the strictest economy a sum sufficient to purchase property was saved. 
A beautiful location was selected and a fair prospect of permanence was secured. 
Although the school received help from the Peabody education fund and the John 
F, Slater fund, and from friends North and East, the aim was, from the beginning, to 
draw its support mainly from the State, and all expenditures are estimated upon-the 
basis of State funds. The legislature of 1885 raised the annual appropriation to 
$4,000. The school grounds comprise about 4 acres fronting on one of the prettiest 
thoroughfares in the city. Palmer Hall, the principal building, is one of the best 
school edifices in the State. The chapel has a seating capacity of 500. The general 
assembly of Alabama of 1890-91 made this school the beneficiary of that part of the 
Congressional grant given under the act approved August 30, 1890, ‘“‘to the more 
complete endowment and support of the colleges for the benefit of agriculture and 
the mechanical arts.”’ The institution is thus a normal, mechanical, and agricultural 
school for the colored people of Alabama. The new era of the school was inaugu- 
rated by the purchase of 182 acres of land 3 miles north of Huntsville on which the 
necessary buildings have been erected. The president’s report for the session ending 
August 31, 1891, records the following departments: 
I. Department of mechanic arts.—Section 1, carpentry; section 2, printing; section 
8, mattress making; section 4, shoemaking. 
II. Department of Agriculture.—Section 1, farming and horticulture; section 2, 
dairy and live stock. : 
III. Department of English language and literature. 
IV. Department of mathematical science. 
V. Department of physical science. 
VI. Department of natural science. 
VII. Department of economic science.—Section 1, laundering; section 2, cooking; 
section 3, sewing. 
Among these ‘‘departments’”’ the ‘‘normal’’ is conspicuous by its absence, but 
among the ‘‘courses of study’? will be found a normal course of three years, the first 
year giving ‘‘practice in training school;”’ the second year, theory and practice of 
teaching, and the third year, theory and the practice of teaching with ‘‘school law.’ 
Comparing the title, ‘‘State normal and industrial school,’’ with the printed pro- 
gramme, one is reminded of Falstaff’s poor ‘‘half-pennyworth of bread.” 
- In order to be admitted into the normal and industrial departments of the institu- 
tion, a pupil must be 14 years of age, of good moral character, and able to read and 
write and understand arithmetic to fractions. Tuition is free, and boarding expenses 
are $8 a month, of which $7 are paid in cash and $1 in work. ‘‘The aim of instruc-

tion,’’ says the president in his last report, ‘‘is to turn out practical men and women. 
Our plan is a combination of the constructive and instructive methods. The student 
sees his efforts constantly producing useful articles for home use or for the market. 
In the construction of an ordinary table there are all the steps from the first lesson 
of the apprentice to the finishing touches of the skilled cabinetmaker, and so on 
through all the departments of industry. Hence, the various industries soon return 
something to the institution and offer opportunities for students to help themselves 
through school.”’ 
Schedule of daily exercises.—Rising, dressing, and arranging rooms, 5 to 5.30 a. m.; 
study hour, 5.30 to 6.45; devotion, 6.45 to 7; breakfast, 7 to 7.50; school, 8 a. m. to 
1p.m.; dinner, 1 to 2; general work, 2 to 4; recreation, 4 to 6; tea, 6 to 7; devotion, 
7 to 7.15; study, 7.15 to 9; retiring taps, 9. 
The school employs 16 teachers, and the last catalogue registered 326 pupils, of 
whom 96 were in the normal department proper. ‘The teachers are assigned as fol- 
lows: To mechanic arts, 4; to agriculture, 2; to English language, 4; to mathematical 
science, 1; to physical science, 1; to natural science, 1; to economic science, 3.1 
TUSKEGEE NORMAL AND INDUSTRIAL INSTITUTE. 
The Tuskegee Normal School was established by an act.of the legislature of Alabama, 
passed in 1880, and was opened in a church July 4, 1881, with 30 students and 1 
teacher. ‘The school has now (1891), including the night school and the training 
school, 730 pupils, of whom 212 are in the normal department. The normal course 
includes reading, spelling, arithmetic, geography, grammar, history, physiology, 
rhetoric, literature, algebra, geometry, physies, botany, bookkeeping, school laws of 
Alabama, theory and practice of teaching, music, drawing, civil government and 
political economy, mental.and moral philosophy. The theory and practice of teach- 
ing is one of the eight subjects pursued by the senior class. The industrial depart- 
ment has advanced to a high state of efficiency; it is subdivided into the following 
branches: 
1. Agriculture.—The farm.of 1,480 acres not only furnishes valuable employment 
for students, but supplies largely the demands of the school. 
2. Brickmaking.—On the farm have been found beds of clay suitable for making 
prick. From these beds the students have made bricks enough (and have laid them 
themselves) to build four substantial buildings for school use. 
8. Carpentry.—The shop is furnished with several sets of tools, and the students 
are taught to make fences, build cottages, make and repair furniture, ete. 
4. Printing.—The office is well furnished and is under the management of a first- 
class printer. The students do much job work for the school and the surrounding 
country. 
5. Blacksmithing.—At present the blacksmith and wheelwright shops are combined. 
This department does all the work for the school and farm, and much for the town 
and country. 
6. Tinsmithing, shoemaking, harness making.—All the roofing is done by students from 
the tin shop, and a large quantity of tinware is furnished the boarding department. 
7. Sewing.—Much of the dressmaking for the girls and all the plain sewing of the 
school are done in this department. In connection with it is a sales room, in which 
the products of the sewing room are offered forsale to the students. 
&. Laundry.—Here the girls are taught the art.of washing and ironing after the 
most improved methods. Very little machinery has been introduced. 
9. Sawmill.—A large portion of the farm is covered with pine forest, which sup- 
plies the mill with timber. A planing mill is attached which dresses the lumber for

use. Without the sawmill, the brickyard, and the carpenter’s shop it would have 
been impossible, with restricted means, to put up the buildings required by the 
institute. 
Tuition is free. The price of board, including washing, lights, fuel, etc., is $8 per 
month. Students are given an opportunity to work out $2 or $3 per month, so that 
with a good outfit of clothing $50 is sufficient to carry an industrious student through 
the school year of nine months. 
The appropriation of $2,000 annually made by the State legislature at first was 
increased in 1883 to $3,000 annually. The whole State appropriation is used to pay 
tuition, for all other expenses the school looks to its friends, North and South. 
The school property is (1892) valued at $125,000, and is entirely free of debt. 
EMERSON INSTITUTE, MOBILE. 
The Emerson Institute is one of a large number of schools organized soon after the 
war by the American Missionary Association for the benefit of the freedmen in the 
South, and kept up after the special need for such aid ceased to be severely felt. 
The building known as the “‘ Blue College,”’ on Government street, was at first occu- 
pied as a primary school, and afterwards (1873), by the liberality of Mr. Emerson, 
of Rockford, Iil., it developed into a normal and academic institute. In the same 
year the building was destroyed by fire, but the school was maintained under great 
disadvantages until 1878, when it was removed toa new building in Holley’s Garden. 
Four years later this house also was burned, and the school work was carried on in 
church buildings. In the summer of 1882 another and larger building was erected, 
and in 1889 an industrial building was added, in which the boys are taught wood- 
working and the girls to sew and cook. The ‘‘normal course’’ includes geometry, 
physics, general history, English literature, mental science, geology, astronomy, and 
the ‘science of education.” The whole number of registered students (1891) is 322, 
of whom 28 are in the normal department.” 
Mississiprr. 
TOUGALOO UNIVERSITY. 
In 1869 the American Missionary Association purchased 500 acres of land, with 
a fine mansion upon it, at Tougaloo, 7 miles north of the State capital, and proceeded 
to open a school for the education of colored persons. There is a little romance con- 
nected with the early history of the place. Prior to the war a wealthy bachelor 
owned a valuable plantation of over 2,000 acres in the very heart of the State of Mis- 
sissippi. A charming young lady, to whom he was paying his addresses, promised 
to become his wife if he would build her the finest house in the State. The condi- 
tion was accepted, and the house soon began to show its grand proportions; but 
while the ardent lover was preparing a $25,000 cage for his bird a rival carried off the 
bird. The cage remained stationary, and was used as a storehouse for cotton, until 
the officers of the American Missionary Association had their attention called to it 
as a favorable location for their projected school. 
Two other buildings were soon after erected, and when the school was chartered 
by the State in 1871, there were comfortable accommodations for 60 boarding 
students. In the early history of the school it was adopted by the State as one of 
its normal schools, but, on account of the difficulty created by having two boards of 
trustees to run the same institution, the State withdrew its support in 1877, Two 
years later a board of visitors was appointed to visit the school annually and report 
    1Catalogues of the Tuskegee State Normal School, 1882, 1890. Report of the principal to the State

directly to the legislature. Since that time the State has appropriated from $2,000 
to $3,000 annually for the support of the school. The foundation of a new hall, to 
replace Washington Hall, which had been destroyed by fire, was laid in 1882. It 
was called Strieby Hall, in honor of the oldest living secretary of the American 
Missionary Association. In the fall of the same year a blacksmith’s shop was built, 
and in the next two years carpenter and tin shops were added, making a good 
beginning of an industrial department, which has since been liberally aided from 
the ‘‘Slater fund.’ In 1888 a small building was fitted up asa ‘Girls’ Industrial 
Cottage,’’ which served to make a beginning in that line of work. During 1886-87, 
through the generosity of Mr. Stephen Ballard, of New York City, a two-story 
building was put up on the old site of Washington Hall, and was called ‘Ballard 
Hall.” This building furnishes ample accommodations for the schoolroom work 
in all the grades below the normal department. The ‘Ballard shops’’ were also 
completed during the year, furnishing ample room for all the shops under one roof. 
These two buildings were completed with the $5,000 given by Mr. Ballard. They 
are substantial, commodious, and cheap. All of the work upon them was done by 
students trained in the industrial department." 
The school is arranged in four grades—primary, intermediate, grammar, and 
normal. The normal course also embraces four grades of one year each. The sub- 
jects in the first grade are composition, algebra, physiology, and physical geography; 
in the second grade, algebra, rhetoric and literature, natural philosophy, and book- 
keeping; in the third grade, geometry, geology, general history, and botany; in the 
fourth grade, political economy, mental science, moral science, pedagogics, Scripture 
history, review of common branches, and composition. 
The number of students in June, 1890, was, in the normal grade, 33; grammar, 
90; intermediate, 160; primary, 100; total, 383. 
The course of training in the industrial department is, first year, carpentry; second 
year, blacksmithing and wheelwrighting; third year, painting, turning, and tinning. 
All the young women are taught to sew and mend. Dressmaking is taught to a 
limited number. Class instruction and practical lessons in cooking are given every 
day. Four girls each month have the privilege of keeping house in the ‘‘ Cottage,”’ 
and while learning to cook and plan for themselves, they also lighten their expenses. 
STATE NORMAL SCHOOL, HOLLY SPRINGS. 
The State Normal School at Holly Springs was opened in 1870 for the purpose of 
training teachers (colored) for the public schools of the State. Only such persons as 
intended to become teachers were admitted to full membership. The enabling act 
of the legislature provided that ‘‘each representative in the State shall be entitled to’ 
send one pupil each term of twenty weeks of said school, said pupil to be recom- 
mended by the representatives to the board of trustees. The person thus admitted 
shall be free of tuition: Provided, The applicant shall be of good moral character and 
shall sustain a satisfactory examination and sign a declaration of intention to follow 
the business of teaching common schools in this State for at least the term of three 
years.”’ 
The last catalogue (1891) gives the number of registered students as 170—young 
men, 93; young women, 77. There are reported as studying geometry, 8; algebra, 
24; Latin, 6; theory and practice of teaching, 9; pedagogy, 4; psychology, 8; English 
grammar, 108; reading, writing, and spelling, 120. 
The course of study as published in the first catalogue of the institution is worthy 
of preservation. It is in some respects a model.

JACKSON COLLEGE. 
This institution was at first known as the Natchez Seminary. It is one of the 17 
institutions founded and sustained for the education of preachers and teachers for the 
colored people of the South. It was opened in 1877, but no catalogue was issued until 
1880, when the seminary had on its roll 31 students preparing for the ministry, 46 
preparing to teach, and 40 general students. The design of the seminary was declared 
to be ‘‘to aid those men who have a divine vocation to the sacred ministry to obtain 
a better understanding of the Holy Scriptures; to aid them to take a connected view 
of the Christian doctrines; to learn the best methods of teaching the way of salva- 
tion; to study the composition of persons; to become practically acquainted with the 
usages of the Church of Christ, etc.’ 
Another design of the school was ‘‘to afford a good opportunity for study and 
instruction to young men and women who wished to be prepared to teach the public 
schools.’’? The courses of study extended through five years, embracing the ordi- 
nary grammar school and high school branches of study, with mental and moral 
philosophy, biblical interpretation, sermon-making, preaching, church polity, and 
systematic theology. The expenses were very low—tuition, $1 a month; room rent, 
$1 a month; washing, $1 a month, and board $5 a month. Among the 23 rules for 
the seminary and family, the first deserves special notice: ‘‘There are no penalties 
for misconduct; none remain who fail to regard our simple rules.”’ 
In 1882 the ‘‘art of teaching’’ was added to the normal course, but it has no place 
in the printed curriculum of 1884. In 1885 the seminary took possession of its new 
building in Jackson, Miss., a fine brick structure three stories high, with a basement, 
erected by the Home Mission Society. It was then called Jackson College. 
Though the name of a ‘‘normal department”’ has been kept in the catalogues to 
the present time, there is no evidence of any distinctive normal instruction being 
given. The following are the subjects assigned to the several instructors: Theology,

natural sciences, history, mathematics and music, and English studies. The normal 
department, so called, is really preparatory to the academic department, for ‘‘ the 
academic course comprises all the studies of the normal course and two years of 
study in addition.” 
The John F. Slater fund provides for the industrial department. Students of both 
sexes are taught such branches of useful and practical knowledge as will enable them 
to earn their living by the labor of their hands. The young women have a sewing 
room and the young men have shops in which work is done in carpentry, lathe work, 
tin work, and brick laying.’

STRAIGHT UNIVERSITY, NEW ORLEANS. 
In the spring of 1869 a few gentlemen conceived the idea of planting this university 
to meet an acknowledged want of the colored population. The Freedmen’s Bureau 
and the American Missionary Association at once pledged their cooperation. A site 
was selected on one of the most beautiful streets in thé city. The American Mis- 
sionary Association purchased the grounds, and the Government assured the erection 
of buildings to the value of $20,000. An act of incorporation was secured ‘‘ with the 
power to confer all such degrees and honors as are conferred by universities in the 
United States of America.’”’ While the buildings were in process of construction a 
normal department was opened in one of the churches, and 60 students were regis- 
tered. The institution bears the name of one of its most liberal benefactors, Sey- 
mour Straight. From the first there was contemplated the organization of a law 
department, a medical department, a collegiate department, a normal department, 
an academic department, and an elementary department. Time has not quite ful- 
filled all the expectations of its founders. The theological department is still in 
existence, with 6 students; the college with 9, including 2 preparatory classes, and 
the normal with 64. The academic and lower grades number 483. The faculty of 
the college department is the same as the faculty of the normal department, and the 
printed curriculum of the normal course indicates no strictly professional training, 
with the exception of psychology and science of education, in the fourth year, which 
divide the attention of the student with civil government, astronomy, geology, and 
English literature.” 
NEW ORLEANS UNIVERSITY. 
The New Orleans University was chartered by the legislature in 1873, but a regular 
normal department was not opened until 1883, when there were 25 normal students 
on the roll, the course of study being ‘‘a review of the studies of the grammar depart- 
ment with lectures on managing schools and teaching, together with practical exercises 
in the same.’’ In 1885 the department was arranged in two divisions, the normal 
scientific and the normal language divisions. The difference is sufficiently indicated 
by the titles. The whole numberof students in the normal department was 14. In 
1888 the number registered was 9. In 1889 the number of normal students was 27,

and the course was extended from two years to three, ‘methods of instruction and 
practice teaching” forming part of the curriculum in each term of every year. The 
number of normal students in the next two years was 38 and 39, respectively. The 
aggregate number of students attending the University was 562." 
ARKANSAS. 
BRANCH NORMAL COLLEGE OF THE INDUSTRIAL UNIVERSITY, PINE BLUFF. 
The Branch Normal College is a department of the Arkansas Industrial Univer- 
sity, established pursuant to an act of the general assembly approved April, 1873. It 
has been in operation since September, 1875. The enabling act requires the branch 
college to ‘be governed by the same rules and regulations as the principal college, 
and makes it the duty of the board of trustees ‘‘to furnish the branch college with 
professors and teachers and other necessary employees, equal in numbers, attain- 
ments, and other desirable qualifications to those furnished and employed in sail 
principal normal college;’’ ‘‘to prescribe the same books and the same course of 
study,” and ‘‘to confer upon graduates thereof like honors, commendations, and 
degrees to those had or given in said principal normal college.”” The appointment 
of students to this.branch college, like appointments to the parent university at 
Fayetteville, is vested in the county courts. All students thus appointed are entitled 
to four years’ free tuition upon the payment of $5 matriculation fee at the time of 
entering the school. ‘The number of possible beneficiaries is about 400, and the 
ayerage number of actual beneficiaries about 200, of whom one-third are in the 
normal department proper and two-thirds in the preparatory. The course of study 
has two divisions—the normal, leading to the degree of licentiate of instruction, 
and the classical, to the degree of bachelor of arts, the former oceupying four years 
and the latter six. Pedagogics has a place in the second year of the normal course, 
history of education and school management in the third, and science of education 
in the fourth. The optional studies are reading and spelling, elementary chemistry, 
elementary botany, zoology, surveying, and ethics. Latin, geometry, plane trigonom- 
etry, algebra, physics, general chemistry, and psychology are obligatory. 
The “‘normal course of study,’’ according to the last announcement, ‘‘is not what 
goes by that name in many of our institutions—that is, a mere preparation for teach- 
ing the common-school branches—but differs from the usual college curriculum 
merely in the omission of one or two branches of higher mathematics, and having 
less in Greek. The institution is strictly confined to the higher branches, and chil- 
dren who are not somewhat advanced in the common-school branches are not 
admitted.’’? 
It is interesting to compare the course of study outlined above with the printed 
programme for the year 1879-80, when the “‘real work of the normal’? commenced. 
  First year.—Latin, algebra, plane geometry and trigonometry, physical geography, 
history, English diction, and elocution. 
Second year.—Latin, plane and spherical trigonometry, descriptive geometry, inor- 
ganic chemistry, chemical physics, zoology, rhetoric, botany, and analytical geom- 
etry. 
Third year.—Latin, solid geometry, differential calculus, integral calculus, miner- 
alogy, geology, organic chemistry, English literature, and logic. 
Fourth year.—Latin, natural philosophy, mental philosophy, moral philosophy, 
political economy, history of civilization, civil polity, evidences of Christianity, Con- 
stitution oe the United States, international law, philology, and history of inductive 
sciences. 
Must we sometimes apply the definition of faith to school catalogues—“‘the sub- 
stance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen?”’

SOUTHLAND COLLEGE AND NORMAL INSTITUTE. 
This institute was established by the Indiana Yearly Meeting of the Religious 
Society of Friends in 1864. The normal grade was instituted in 1869. The college 
department was organized in 1872. 
For admission to the preparatory or normal course the student must have com- 
pleted McGuffey’s Fourth Reader, Swinton’s Language Lessons, Eclectic Primary 
Geography, and Ray’s Practical Arithmetic to decimal fractions. The course of study 
in the ‘‘preparatory and normal department’’ can be completed in three years. The 
first year is devoted to arithmetic, geography, and grammar; the second, after com- 
pleting arithmetic and grammar, to history of the United States and bookkeeping; 
the third year to algebra, physics, physical geography, physiology, and civil govern- 
ment. Pedagogy is added for those who desire the diploma of the normal course. 
There are 5 students in the college department and 89 in the ‘preparatory and 
normal.’’ The number of students in the normal department (1890) is 89.1 
Texas. 
TILLOTSON COLLEGIATE AND NORMAL INSTITUTE, AUSTIN. 
This school was founded by the American Missionary Association and is conducted 
under its auspices. It takes its name from the Rev. George J. Tillotson, of Weath- 
ersfield, Conn., who contributed largely in money and personal efforts to the erection 
of the main building. It was opened on the 17th of January, 1881, and at the end 
of the second year had an enrollment of 283 students, of whom 50 were pursuing the 
normal course. 
The object of the institute is to furnish to the colored people an opportunity to 
acquire a thoroughly practical common-school education; to prepare those who pro- 
pose to take a more extended course for entrance to the highest educational institu- 
tions of the land; to train teachers for all positions in the public schools. 
There are two normal courses, ‘‘elementary and higher,’’ each occupying two 
years. The studies of the first year are arithmetic, algebra, physical geography, 
reading, rhetorical exercises, history of Texas, vocal music, carpentry, sewing, cook- 
ing. Second year: Algebra and arithmetic completed, rhetoric, rhetorical exercises, 
physiology, botany, school economy, primary methods, carpentry, dressmaking, 
cooking. Third year: Plane geometry, physics, English and American literature, 
general history, elocution, rhetorical exercises, carpentry (optional). Fourth year: 
Astronomy, zoology, mental philosophy, civil government, rhetorical exercises, 
methods of teaching, practice teaching. 
The number of students in the elementary course (1891) was 24; in the higher, 3.” 
STATE NORMAL SCHOOL, PRAIRIE VIEW. 
This school owes its origin to an act of the legislature of Texas approved April 19, 
1879, which authorized the establishment at Prairie View (formerly called Alta 
Vista) of a normal school for the preparation and training of colored teachers. The 
act requires the board of directors of the Agricultural and Mechanical College of 
Texas to organize such a school as soon as practicable, so as to admit one student 
from each senatorial district, and at least three students from the State at large, to 
be taken from the colored population of the State, and to be not less than 16 years 
of age at the time of their admission. All students admitted are required to sign a 
written obligation binding each student ‘‘to teach in the public free schools for the 
colored children of their respective districts at least one year next after their dis- 
charge from the normal school and as much longer than one year as the time of their

connection with the normal school shall exceed one year,’’ and for the same rate of 
compensation as other teachers of such schools receive. The directors are also 
required to make rules by which students can obtain certificates of qualification as 
teachers, which will entitle them to teach without further examination. The sum 
of $6,000 a year was appropriated for the support of the school. This sum was after- 
wards increased, the appropriation for 1889-90 being $10,000 for the normal and 
$5,000 for the industrial department. 
Candidates for admission must sustain a satisfactory examination, conducted by a 
board of examiners appointed by the senators of the several districts of the State, in 
arithmetic as far as decimal fractions, orthography, English grammar and composi- 
tion, history of Texas, and history of the United States. The course of study embraces 
three years. In the first year reading and spelling, grammar and geography, inven- 
tional geometry, drawing, writing, vocal music, and calisthenics. In the second year 
the same studies are continued, with algebra, physiology, and lectures on professional 
work and school management. In the third year there is a general review of com- 
mon branches, with special reference to teaching them, and, in addition, natural phi- 
lesophy, plane geometry, bookkeeping, rhetoric, English literature, general history, 
psychology, and civil government. 
The industrial department is made subordinate to the normal features of the 
school. No attempt is made to equip students thoroughly in any particular line of 
the industries, but liberal provision has been made and shops have been furnished 
for the instruction and practice of young men in the principal operations of wood 
and iron working. 
Girls have a special teacher who instructs them in the different kinds of sewing, 
both by hand and on machines, in cutting and fitting, in cooking, laundering, and 
general housework. 
There are 225 acres of Jand belonging to the school. About 100 acres are culti- 
vated in farm and garden. Lectures are delivered to the students on soil, fertilizers, 
cultivation of different crops, the care of orchards, stock raising, and care of cattle. 
A branch of the United States experimental station has been placed in charge of the 
agricultural department of this school. 
The number of students enrolled in June, 1890, was 129. One student from each 
senatorial district and 15 from the State at large were admitted free of charge for 
board and tuition, and those who show a decided ability for teaching may be 
returned for a second year. The number of graduates from 1885 to 1889, inclusive, 
was 78, of whom all but 7 were reported in 1890 as ‘‘teaching”’ and 6 as “‘ having 
taught.’’?

LINCOLN INSTITUTE, JEFFERSON CITY. 
Lincoln Institute had its origin in a fund of $6,379 contributed by the Sixty-second 
and Sixty-fifth regiments of United States Colored Infantry when discharged from 
service in January, 1866. The school was opened in September of that year and 
was taught in rented buildings. In June, 1871, the present Lincoln Institute build- 
ing was completed. It is a substantial brick structure, 60 by 70 feet, conveniently 
arranged and eligibly located upon a prominent hill just outside the limits of Jeffer- 
son City. The grounds contain 20 acres. The legislature of 1879 appropriated 
$15,000 for the support of the institute; but this appropriation was found to be uncon- 
stitutional, being a grant of public money to a corporation. At the suggestion of 
Governor Phelps the board of trustees met and unanimously voted to transfer the 
institute to the State. The bill was then immediately approved, and the legislature

in succeeding years made liberal appropriations for its current expenses and also for 
repairs, buildings, library, and apparatus. 
There are four departments—the college, the preparatory, the normal, and the ele- 
mentary. The object of the normal department is to prepare teachers for the colored 
schools of the State. It has two courses of study; the first covers two years and the 
second four. Students who complete the two years’ course receive graded certifi- 
cates, entitling them to teach the branches named therein for two years from the 
date of graduation. Graduates from the four years’ course receive diplomas which 
authorize them to teach in any county in the State withoutexamination. Pedagogies 
has no definite place in the printed course of study, but ‘‘ principles and methods of 
teaching, class management, and school government receive attention throughout the 
course, also spelling, eloeution, and composition;” and normal students are required 
to participate in the teachers’ institute, which is held biweekly. 
By an act of the thirty-sixth general assembly an industrial department was estab- 
lished in connection with the institute. The object of this department, which was 
opened in October, 1891, is ‘‘to give the students an opportunity to learn trades and 
to study those branches of knowledge pertaining to agriculture.” 
The faculty consists of the president, 4 professors, and 2 assistants. The superin- 
tendent of the industrial department is a graduate of the manual training school of 
St. Louis. 
The number of pupils enrolled in the normal department (catalogue of 1891) is 42; 
in the elementary, 151; in the preparatory, 11; in the college, 1; total, 205.1

CITY NORMAL AND TRAINING SCHOOLS. 
The city training school, call it by what name we may, would seem to be the 
simplest of all normal school problems. Given a city of a certain population, 
increasing at acertain probable rate, .a definite school system, a printed course of 
in tion,-2 number of principals selected by merit or by personal or political 
favoritism, it should not be difficult to train a sufficient number of assistants every 
year to aid these principals in the instruction and government of the schools. But 
the evolution of the training school has not been aceomplished on purely professional 
lines. The need of good assistant teachers is the ostensible cause and furnishes the 
public with a sufficient motive; but other ends have also to be served. The school 
goyernment is a close corporation; the school-teachers must ‘be selected from among 
qualified residents of the city; the outside world must be kept out that home labor 
may be protected. But this very protection adds to the embarrassment of the school 
authorities in the selection of teachers, for there are three home applicants for every 
ve sy. The training sehool weeds out some of the incompetents, and the choice 
becomes more restricted and less embarrassing. The work of the training school, 
however comprehensive in theory, is practically restricted to the graduating of 
young teachers who will satisfy the demands of the principals and the superintend- 
ents in numbers not too large for the needs of the schools and yet not so small as to 
give the school directors no opportunity for choice. ‘The school curriculum must. 
not be too modern, for that would offend the old-fashioned principals; neither must 
it be antiquated, for that would not suit the progressive superintendents. 
As if the problem were not already sufliciently complicated, the public steps in 
and demands that young people who are not to beGome teachers should have equal 
opportunities of higher education with those who are to receive professional instruc- 
tion, hence the title ‘high and normal school,’’ with which nearly all such insti- 
tutions have been ushered into the world, and which has connected them as closely 
as were the Siamese twins. But the general, if not the universal experience, has

been that a school, like a locomotive, can not run on two lines, however slightly 
divergent, at the same time. It will be switched off either to the high school track 
or to the normal track. In the end the trains are divided, to the great advantage of 
both. 
Tt has not been thought advisable to give many samples of the city training school. 
One might almost'say, ab uno disce omnes. The Report of the United States Com- 
missioner of Education for 1889 gives a list of 58 city training schools and classes, 
attended by 538 students. Most, if not all of these, are connected with city high 
schools and have no independent history. The experiences of the cities of Phila- 
delphia, Boston, New York, and Chicago contain valuable lessons, and the history of 
the New York College for the Training of Teachers is exceedingly interesting. 
GIRLS’ NORMAL SCHOOL, PHILADELPHIA. 
The act of the legislature of Pennsylvania, passed in 1818, providing ‘‘for the educa- 
tion of children at public expense within tke city and county of Philadelphia,” gave 
to the controllers of public schools the power “‘to establish a model school in order 
to qualify teachers for the sectional schools and for schools in other parts of the 
State.” At that time the Lancasterian system was in the prime of its popularity, 
and the ‘‘model school” allowed by the act was organized by Joseph Lancaster him- 
self in a building still standing on Chester street above Race. This model school 
was used as a school of practice to train teachers and monitors, and to serve asa 
pattern to other schools of the same class. [One of the earliest recollections of the 
writer is of a visit made when he was a boy to a great Lancasterian school in a 
manufacturing city. The master stood on a high platform brandishing his rod of 
office in full view of some 300 pupils. Six small galleries, seated with benches a 
in three or four ascending tiers, gave accommodation to from 12 to 20 small urchins 
in each gallery, over which presided 12 monitors. The children conned their les- 
sons under monitorial supervision and the noise was like the distant roar of the 
much vexed ocean. The presiding genius on the platform touched a little bell and 
called, ‘‘Sand class, come up!’ The sand class came up, and gathered around a 
shallow trough, 3 by 4 feet and 4 inches deep, filled with molding sand of the best. 
quality, on which the master proceeded to illustrate the mysteries of the alphabet. 
Years passed on, and the galleries became recitation rooms, about 12 feetsquare, 
arranged around a central hall, and the boy monitors were supplanted by ladies. 
For many years the school buildings of Philadelphia continued to attest their Lan- 
casterian origin, but finally the pendulum swung around to the opposite side, and a 
schoolhouse became a series of rooms, each in many cases as independent of the 
others as if they belonged to different countries. This independence extended 
largely to the schools of the system, if system it can be called which had been com- 
pared, before the revolution of 1883, to a ‘‘ fortuitous aggregate of educational atoms.”” 
So much “‘ obiter dictum’? may help to a better understanding of the history of the 
Philadelphia Normal School for Girls. ] 
About the year 1836, the model school, having lost its distinctive character asa 
school of practice, became in effect one of the grammar schools of the city, though 
it still retained its name. Twelve years later the controllers of the public schools 
eonyerted the so-called model school into a normal school for the purpose ef qualify- 
ing young ladies to become teachers. It is claimed that this is the first normal 
school not under State control established in any city in the United States. The 
school was opened on the Ist of February, 1848, under Dr. A. T. W. Wright as 
principal, with 6 assistant teachers and 106 pupils. The course of study required 
two years for its completion. The school was popular from the beginning and soon 
outgrew its accommodations; a new building was erected for its use and the normal 
school was transferred to it in 1854 along with the model school, which still kept up 
its connection with the normal. ‘This model school was discontinued as such soon 
after, and in lieu thereof a school of practice was organized. In 1857 Mr. Philip A. 
   
-P-A-G-E-1208
  2448 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
Cregar was elected principal, and in 1859 the ‘‘Girls’ Normal School’? became the 
“Girls’ High School.”? In 1861 the name was again changed to ‘Girls’ High and 
Normal School,’’ and the course of instruction was so modified as to give professional 
training solely in the last year of the course. These changes indicate the gradual 
growth of public sentiment in respect to the higher education of girls and the fitting 
of them for teachers. 
In 1865 Prof. Geo. W. Fetter, the present (1892) principal, was elected, and under 
his wise and efficient management the school has done a great work for popular educa- 
tion in Philadelphia. The school building, which was new in 1854, became antiquated 
before a score of years had passed, and in 1876 the school was transferred to a new 
home, one of the largest and best arranged schoolhouses at that time in existence. 
It was dedicated on the 30th of October, amid congratulations on past success and 
prophecies of future prosperity. The Hon. Simon Gratz gave voice to the sentiments 
and wishes of the people when he said in his opening address:! 
And now, with a building which, in point of elegance and fitness, will rival any in 
the land, a corps of teachers who \would do honor to any institution of Jearning, an 
enlarged and comprehensive course of study which will cultivate and sharpen the 
reasoning faculties, stimulate thought, and store the minds of the pupils with an 
ample stock of useful knowledge, ‘and last, but of the first importance, that indis- 
pensable adjunct, a thoroughly organized school of practice in which constant oppor- 
tunity may be had for testing the ability of the pupil to make practical application 
of her theoretical knowledge of methods of teaching and of discipline, may we not 
reasonably expect to achieve such results as will make the school worthy of the 
pride of our citizens? 
The following is the course of study adopted in 1876, from which it will be seen 
that the word ‘‘High’”’ need not have been removed from the official title, unless as 
a prophecy of good things to come:

  Constitution of United State: 
    
The course of Scan has naturally changed during the many years of the existence 
of the school, both in its academic and its professional work, in order to keep pace 
with the advance of educational thought throughout the country. This school was 
among the first in the country to introduce a course of physical training, and for a 
number of years has had a complete and systematic course of instruction in this 
department. It was also one of the first institutions to introduce several forms of 
manual training suitable for girls. Sewing was introduced in 1881, and has been 
taught with success since that time. Cookery became one of the regular branches 
in 1887, and thus pioneered its introduction into the grammar schools of the city. 
Other changes are gradually made in the course of study to meet the demands of 
the time, until in 1887 the following quite complete course in academic and pedago- 
gical ane was adopted.

  2450 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
The growth and work of the school will be indicated by the following facts: The 
school opened February 1, 1848, with 106 pupils and 7 teachers, including the prin- 
cipal. In 1865 it contained 270 pupils and 10 teachers. Since that time the most. 
remarkable increase in numbers has been made that can be found in the history of 
any normal school in the country, with the possible exception of the one in New 
York. It now (December, 1892) contains 1,850 pupils, with 54 teachers. Since its 
establishment 5,772 pupils have graduated. Of that number 4,878 have been engaged 
in teaching in the public schools of the city. At the present time nearly 2,400 of 
the teachers in Philadelphia are graduates of the school, including a large majority 
of the women principals of the city. 
The school has also done a great work for Philadelphia in addition to its training 
of the teachers of the public schools. One of the graduates has filled the pulpit, 
quite a number have distinguished themselves in literary work, several have studied 
medicine and are successful practitioners, many have adopted art work as their pro- 
fession, and a few have gone as missionaries to foreign lands. Two of the 7 assist- 
ant superintendents of the public schools of the city are graduates of the institution. 
But perhaps the greatest work of the school is found in the many happy homes into 
which the mother educated in the school has carried the influence of its culture, 
sending out of refined home circles the future citizens and rulers of the city. 
With the growth of population and the increased interest in education, it was seen 
some four or five years ago that the building was inadequate to meet the demands 
for the higher education of the young women of the city. It was then proposed to 
_reorganize the school by making of the present school a girls’ high school and erect- 
ing a new building for the girls’ normal school. Superintendent MacAlister, in his 
report for 1889, says: ‘“‘The necessity for some radical changes in the normal school 
is now realized I believe by a large proportion of the members of the board of public 
education.’’? The idea of a division of the institution into two different schools—a 
high school and a normal school—soon became the prevailing one. Professor Fetter, 
in his report for 1890, says: ‘‘A new building and a division of the school are now 
imperatively demanded.” 
The reorganization contemplated by the friends of the school is being carried into 
effect by Superintendent Brooks. The high and the normal schools are to be sepa- 
rated, making of them two distinct schools under different supervision and control. 
The new building for the normal school, which will be ready for occupancy in Sep- 
tember next, will be one of the finest edifices of the kind in the country. The pres- 
ent building will then be used for a new girls’ high school, which, in accordance 
with the present plan, will probably embrace three distinct courses of study—one 
intended to prepare young women for admission into the normal school, a second 
to qualify them for a business or a commercial life, and a third to give a higher edu- 
cation to such as do not desire to become teachers or enter upon business pursuits. 
The normal school will have a two years’ course, including the science and the 
art of teaching. The following outline will indicate the proposed scope of the normal 
course: 
A.—The science of teaching. 
I. Methods of culture.—(a) Physical culture, (b) mental culture, (1) intellectual, 
(2) sesthetic, (3) moral. 
Ii. Methods of instruction.—(a) Language, (b) mathematics, (c) physics, (d) his- 
tory, (e) the arts. 
III. School economy.—(a) School preparation, (b) school organization, (¢) school 
employments, (d) school government, (¢) school authorities, (7) school systems. 
IV. The philosophy of education.

B.—The art of teaching. 
(1) Observation of model teaching. 
(2) Practice in model schools. 
(3) Preparation of school apparatus. 
Each of these topics will be subdivided into departments of instruction to be com- 
pleted in the two years.' 
BOSTON NORMAL SCHOOL. 
Dr. Edwin P. Seaver, superintendent of schools in Boston, writes as follows in his 
report for 1891: 
One chief funetion of superintendentand supervisors is to provide a supply of com- 
petent teachers for the schools. This is the function of the normal school, too; but 
the normal school furnishes only a portion of the supply, namely, that which comes 
from the city itself. There has always been and there always will bea portion of the 
supply coming from outside the city. 
This latter portion is in some respects the more important of the two. It happens 
sometimes that the policy of taking teachers from outside the city is discouraged, 
such a policy pelne SOE Rosas to make against the interests of the normal school or of 
its graduates; at other times the same policy is favored because of the pressing need 
to appoint experienced teachers rather than beginners in the most difficult places. So 
ipreciice fluctuates, but within limits; for the necessity of employing some teachers 
irom outside the city never wholly disappears even in the primary and grammar 
schools. With the supply of male teachers for these schools and of all teachers for 
high schools the normal school has little or nothing to, do. 
A normal school was established in 1852 by the city council, on the recommenda- 
tion of the school board, as a part of the public-school system of Boston. In 1854 
the school board, with the view of adapting the school to the double purpose of giving 
to its pupils both high-school and normal instruction, introduced a few additional 
branches of study, made a slight alteration in the arrangement of the course, and 
called it the Girls’ High and Normal School. Under this name the school was con- 
tinued until 1872, when the school board, finding that the normal element had been 
gradually absorbed by the high school, and had almost lost its independent, distinc- 
tive, and professional character, returned the normal school to its original condition 
asa separate school. Since then, under the name of the Boston Normal School, its 
sole work has been the fitting of young women for the office of teaching. 
The course of study in this school is all pursued with special reference to teach- 
ing, and is as follows: (1) Psychology and logic, (2) principles of education, (3) 
methods of instruction and discipline, (4) physiology and hygiene, (5) the studies 
of the primary and grammar schools, (6) observation and practice in the training 
school, (7) observation and practice in the other public schools, (8) science of lan- 
_guage, (9) phonies, (10) gymnastics, (11) vocal music, (12) drawing and blackboard 
illustration, (13) special study of the theory and practice of the kindergarten for 
those members of the postgraduate class who desire to qualify themselves for teach- 
ing in that department. 
There is a postgraduate course of one year in this school for the further study of 
the principles of education and methods of instruction, and for observation and 
practice in teaching; and pupils attending this course may be employed as substi- 
tutes or appointed as permanent teachers. ; 
In 1876 the Rice district was constituted a training school, where the normal 
pupils have an opportunity of gaining by observation and practice a familiar 
acquaintance with the discipline and instruction of the Boston schools. The training 
school contains eleven grammar and seven primary classes, numbering about 1,000 
pupils. .

A certificate that a candidate has completed the fourth year of the high-school 
course is accepted as proof of qualification for admission. The course of study in the 
Boston high schools embraces the following subjects: Composition; rhetoric; 
English literature; ancient, mediseval, and modern history; civil government; botany; 
zoology; anatomy and physiology; chemistry; phy ; astronomy; arithmetic, 
including the metric system; algebra; geometry; plane trigonometry; Latin, or 
French or German; vocal music, and drawing. 
The board of supervisors do not admit to an examination for a situation as teacher 
any person who is not a graduate of the Boston Normal School, or of one of the State 
normal schools, unless such person has had at least one year’s experience as a 
teacher.

POSTGRADUATE COURSE. 
The work of the postgraduate class includes: (1) A further study of the prin- 
ciples of education, with special reference to their appplication in teaching the 
different subjects of the regular course, and in school discipline; (2) the history 
of education. 
THE NORMAL COLLEGE OF NEW YORK CITY. 
The statute empowering the board of education to establish the free academy 
(now the College of the City of New York) for boys also empowered it to establish 
one or more similar institutions for girls. The legislature of 1847 intended to extend 
to each sex equal educational advantages, but the board of education neglected to 
carry out the provisions: of the statute as regards girls. More than twenty years 
after the passage of the law the board of education established an institution for 
girls, in some respects similar to that for boys and in some respects inferior. Twenty 
years later the legislature passed a bill making the Normal College for Girls a real 
college, with all the powers appertaining thereto, and thus carried out the intention 
of the men who governed the State. forty years previously. 
In the fall of 1888 the board of trustees established an academic course of study, 
and an academic class was formed from volunteers from the normal freshman class. 
It started with 83 students; in 1892 it numbered 51. The falling off was caused by 
removals from the city and by the return of a few to the normal department. 
Of-late years the college has been embarrassed by the difficulty of limiting the 
admissions to the number which the building could accommodate. The number 
enrolled in 1890 was 1,766, but the number which could be efficiently instructed and 
comfortably seated was only 1,500. The simplest remedy seemed to be to raise the 
scholastic requirements for admission, but this would have been resisted by the 
principals, and would have been very unpopular. The difficulty was evaded tem- 
porarily by changing the ‘‘plan of marking,’’ and as this contains some valuable 
pedagogic suggestions, it is quoted in full from President Hunter’s report of 1892: 
The plan of marking.—The plan was as follows: 1,000 was made the maximum mark 
that could possibly be attained; and this number was divided into 250 for arithme- 
tic, 250 for English grammar, 150 for geometry, 100 for English composition, 100 for 
drawing, 100 for spelling, 25 for geography, and 25 for history. The subjects requir- 
ing reason and judgment received a value equal to two-thirds of the whole, while the 
purely memoriter subjects received only one-twentieth. The power to draw and the 
ability to spell are not infrequently natural endowments, they are certainly not signs 
of intellectual development; and yet on account of their importance, especially to 
teachers, each received a value of one-tenth. English composition, being really a 
part of English grammar, received also a tenth, for the reason that to the latter a 
very high mark had already been assigned. The low value given to geography and 
history, even had they been regularly taught, was perfectly correct; for the instruc- 
tion heretofore in these subjects was little more than memorizing, which a child of 
12 could accomplish perhaps better than a student of 15. Many candidates, weak in 
arithmetic, which is the foundation of the mathematical studies, and in English gram- 
mar, which is the foundation of the study of the English language, crept into the 
college on the strength of their memories, and at the expiration of a few months 
were compelled to request a leave of absence on account of personal illness, which 
simply meant inability to cope with the college curriculum. It goes without saying 
that geography and history could be so taught as to develop the higher mental pow- 
ers—reason, judgment, and imagination. But the fact remains that asa rule they 
. are not so taught, and until they are it seems wise to give them a minimum value as 
factors for admission. The proof, however, lies in the result. The introductory 
class, formed from the admissions under this method of marking, is the best and 
strongest the college has ever had.

    Drawing.—Instruction in drawing is given one hour a week in every class through- 
out the course. The lessons are of such a nature as to enable teachers to illustrate 
on the blackboard with ease and facility, and to cultivate the eye and hand with 
the view of preparing pupils for industrial pursuits. There is also instruction.in 
modeling during the second and third years. 
Music.—During the freshman, sophomore, and pedagogic years instruction is given 
in the science and art of music, including musical notation, relation of musical sounds, 
musical scales, musical intervals, elements of harmony, exercises in reading and 
writing music, and methods of teaching music. 
Chorus singing in all the classes one and one-half hours a week. 
All students are obliged to study Latin during the entire course. A choice is per- 
mitted of French, German, or Greek, so that, in addition to English, only two lan- 
guages can be pursued. The total enrollment of the college in 1891, was 1,748 
students, of whom 1,333 elected French, 574 German, and 41 Greek. 
COOK COUNTY NORMAL SCHOOL, ILLINOIS. 
“The Cook County Normal School has weathered many storms and has survived 
the test of nearly a quarter of a century,’’ says the president of the board of educa- 
tion in a late report. Under the superintendence of Col. Francis W. Parker it has 
become, as was to be expected, a school sui generis. It will be difficult, therefore, 
to yive a satisfactory account of it on conventional lines. Colonel Parker, as prin- 
cipal, occupies the chair of psychology and pedagogics. The vice-principal teaches 
mathematics, history of education, civics, and political economy. The other studies 
and exercises are provided for as follows: (a) History and literature; (b) the natural 
sciences; (¢) elocution and the Delsarte system of expression; (d) drawing and 
methods in art; (e) physical culture; (f) painting, modeling, wood carving, illus- 
trative drawing; (g) Sloyd and pasteboard work; (h) principles and methods of the 
kindergarten; (i) vocal music; (j) kindergarten; (k) geography; (/) curator of 
museum and assistant teacher of sciences; (m) assistant teacher of history and 
literature; (7) assistant teacher of mathematics; (0) assistant teacher of vocal music, 
penmanship, and primary methods; (p) librarian, secretary-treasurer, and assistant 
teacher of literature; (q) assistant teacher of language; (1) assistant teacher of science; 
(s) superintendent of home handwork; (t) assistant teacher of reading; (u) teacher 
 
-P-A-G-E-1217
  NORMAL SCHOOLS IN THE UNITED STATES. 2457 
of taxidermy and collector for museum; (v) assistant teacher of elocution; (w) 
assistant teacher of elocution and reading; (a) manager of students’ hall. The vice- 
principal is also. principal of the practice school. 
The central motive of the normal school is to prepare candidates for vacant posi- 
tions as teachers in Cook County. The conditions of graduation are: ‘‘(1) Attendance 
for one year (forty weeks) on the professional training class; (2) satisfactory evi- 
dence of a high appreciation of the duties, responsibilities, and possibilities of the 
teacher’s profession; (3) sufficient knowledge and skill to warrant the beginning of 
the work of teaching; (4) ability to control, govern, and teach a school fairly well; 
(5) a knowledge of the principles of education sufficient to guide the candidate to 
the discovery of right methods; (6) a love for children and a devotion to the work 
of teaching; (7) tact to adapt one’s self to the circumstances and at the same time 
courage enough to cling to a growing ideal of the teacher’s functions; (8) a close, 
earnest, indefatigable study of the science of education and of the subjects taught. 
A habit of preparing very carefully every lesson and all other work; (9) good health 
and an excellent character.”’ . 
Graduates of a university, a college, or an accredited high school are admitted to 
the professional training class; also teachers of three years’ successful experience 
holding first-grade certificates. 
Ideally [says Colonel Parker] a pupil should enter the training class equipped 
with knowledge and skill sufficient to begin the work of learning how to teach. 
They should also have the mental power to study economically the laws of the mind 
and the principles of mental growth. Long experience has fully demonstrated that 
very few graduates, if any, of a four years’ high-school course have this requisite 
knowledge, skill, or power. Four years’ course in a good college should supplement 
the high-school course before a student enters upon professional training. It is far 
preferable to have a college course without professional training than to have only a 
high-school course with professional training. The true requirements should be a 
college course and professional training. But the standard of admission to a normal 
school is eevee: by cireumstances which do not admit of an ideal standard. 
When a majority of candidates for positions as teachers attain their purpose by two 
years in a high school and an examination it is obvious that an ideal standard of 
admission to professional training would close the doors of every normal school: - 
The legitimate studies and work of a normal school, according to Colonel Parker, 
are the history of education, psychology, pedagogics or the science of education, ped- 
agogy or the art of teaching, and practice teaching. ‘‘Theoretically it. is much to be 
preferred that a good knowledge of the science of education should be gained before 
a candidate enters upon the functions of his office, but, when there is such short 
time for preparation and there is also a failure of mental power to grasp the prin- 
ciples of education, apparently the only feasible plan to pursue is to use the most 
efficient means to arouse a strong desire to know these principles. This is done by 
practice teaching.”’ 
Unprepared, desultory, fragmentary teaching in practice schools is considered to 
be worse than worthless to the pupils taught and profitless to the pupil teachers; 
consequently the school endeavors to make the practice work of great profit to the 
pupils taught, as well as the best possible means on the part of the pupil teachers of 
learning to teach. The practice school is a regular public school, belonging to and 
supported by the city of Chicago. It embraces the usual eight grades ofa public school 
and is divided, for the practice teaching, into groups of pupils, from six to eight in 
each group. Twogroups are made into a section, and two sections form a division. 
Each group, each section, and each division has a leader, chosen from the training class 
by the critic teachers. There is a regular line of promotion, measured entirely by 
skill in teaching, from the lowest assistant of a group to the highest assistant; from 
assistant to group leader, then to section leader, division leader, and lastly to special 
assistant ina room. The time of practice teaching is one hour each day. The pri- 
mary grades have three lessons in the hour of twenty minutes each; the grammar grades 
haye two lessons of thirty minutes each; thus when there are 40 groups, 100 different 
     
-P-A-G-E-1218
  2458 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
pupil teachers can give lessons during the practice hour. The reasons given for this ~ 
arrangement of groups are that the teaching of small classes is better adapted to the 
abilities of novices, that pupil teachers have more practice in teaghing than “by any 
other plan, and that pupils ceceive more individual attention. 
Every third week the group leaders are moved up one group, and by this plan the 
successful members of the training class teach in all grades during the year. Each 
of the rooms of the practice school is under the direct charge of a critic teacher. 
The eritic teachers are chosen for their knowledge and skill as teachers of their 
respective grades, and for their ability to teach and train pupil teachers. Each reg- 
ular member of the faculty has the general supervision of the work done in the 
practice school in the subject which that member teaches. 
The professional training class works in three divisions. The first division eon- 
sists of pupils who require least help from their teachers. The third division requires 
the most help. Whenever a pupil of the second or third division is capable of doing 
the work of his division he is promoted. If a pupil of the first or second division 
fails hopelessly, he is demoted. When one gives evidence of incapability for the 
work of a teacher he is advised to withdraw. 
The three divisions of this class are divided into eleven working committees each, 
with a chairman and vice-chairman, and to each committee is assigned by its chair- 
man some special work, such as the preparation of maps or the construction of illus- 
trative apparatus.' 
      
NEW YORK COLLEGE FOR THE TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
_ The normal school in its latest and highest development may be most profitably 
studied in connection with the New York College for the Training of Teachers, which 
was chartered by the board of regents of the University of the State of New York 
in January, 1889. Unlike many so-called normal schools, normal colleges, and nor- 
inal universities, its name strictly defines its purposes and fixes itsrank. It does not 
propose a scheme of universal education, but simply to train for the profession of 
teaching those who have obtained elsewhere the elements of a liberal education. It 
isnot aschool. It is notauniversity. It is strictly a college; and a plan is now per- 
fected by which it will become to all intents and purposes a department of Columbia 
College, under the contro! of Columbia College, under the control of the faculty of 
philosophy of that university. At the very outset the founders expressed their inten- 
tion to establish a purely professional school (not anormal school ‘‘in the usual sense 
of that term’’), in which the elements of a secondary education were not to be taught, 
but to be required of candidates for admission. A similar requirement is the condi- 
tion of admission, at least on paper, to most of the State normal schools, but is seldom 
strictly enforced. Indeed, to have insisted on this password would in bygone days 
have closed the doors against almost every applicant, and even at present such a pre- 
liminary would prevent a large majority of those who are most in need of normal 
training from crossing the threshold. But while excluding secondary education as 
such, the New York College offers a very wide range of professional instruction—the 
kindergarten, the primary school, the high school, manual training, physical training, 
music, domestic economy, form and construction, physical and natural science, lan- 
guage and literature, English and Latin, as well as psychology, philosophy, and his- 
tory of education, and organization of schools. It seems to have taken its motto from 
Terence—the reader will excuse the hackneyed quotation—‘‘humani nihil a me alie- 
num puto.” 
The history of the development of this college is extremely interesting. An asso- 
ciation of philanthropic ladies and gentlemen of New York City had been formed in 
1 Reports of the Cook County Board of Education and the Principal of Cook County Normal School 
for 1890,
-P-A-G-E-1219
  
NORMAL SCHOOLS IN THE UNITED STATES. 2459 
1885 to promote industrial education. The work of this body grew rapidly, and 
in 1887 it found itself unable, through lack of means and trained teachers, to answer 
all the demands made upon it. At this juncture the association, known as the 
Industrial Edueation Association, invited Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler, then as now 
professor of philosophy and pedagogy in Columbia College, to become its president. 
He accepted the position and began at once to organize the work so as to earry out 
two plans that he had long cherished—one to put the steadily growing manual- 
training movement upon a strictly educational basis, the other to found an institution 
of high grade for the professional training of teachers. The New York College for. 
the Training of Teachers was then founded by him, and his plans were accepted by 
the Industrial Education Association, which thereupon dissolved, some of its mem- 
bers becoming trustees of the new institution. At first its means were small and its 
quarters cramped, and it devoted itself largely to preparing competent teachers cf the 
several manual-training subjects. The college rapidly won the confidence of the com- 
munity and of the country, and large sums of money were raised for its support and 
development. In two years (January 12, 1889) it was able to meet. the conditions 
imposed by the regents of the University of the State of New York, and obtained 
from them a formal charter. In 1890 Dr. Butler, having accomplished the task that 
he had set before himself, resigned the presidency of the college in order to devote 
himself exclusively to the work of his Columbia professorship. 
The students cover a wide geographical range. The register for 1892 contains the 
names of students from eighteen States, from Canada and from South America. 
The habitat of the college at present is No. 9 University place, New York, formerly 
the location of the Union Theological Seminary; but it has already outgrown its 
enyironment, and a new site has been obtained, the gift of Mr. George W. Vanderbilt, 
twenty-one city lots on block bounded by One hundred and twentieth street, One 
hundred and twenty-first street, Amsterdam avenue and the Boulevard, opposite 
the location chosen for the new buildings of Columbia College. One hundred and 
fifty thousand dollars are in hand for the promotion of this enterprise, $60,000 
pledged, and New York is asked for $450,000 more, which will doubtless be forth- 
coming in good time. 
The public-spirited men and women who have founded and sustained this college 
are planning to make it yet stronger and better. * * * In the art of large giving 
which men and women of wealth are coming more and more to exemplify, there has 
been no lack of diversified experiment, from which experiment two principles, among 
others, have clearly emerged: First, that no form of beneficence can outrank gifts 
for education, for education does much to abolish the opportunity for charity, while 
it increases the quantity and refines the quality of lile; second, that it is well to 
give to some educational agency with initiative in it, something which by virtue of 
new excellence will be widely imitated, either in generous emulation or through 
simple competitive sagacity. The college for training teachers has already had an 
influence for good on the public education of this city, State, and country. Its influ- 
ence will grow in direct proportion as its faculty is increased and strengthened.! 
Candidates for admission must be at least 18 years of age, must present a certifi- 
cate of good moral character, and pass an examination.in the following subjects 
unless exempted from examination under rules given below. 
ENTRANCE EXAMINATIONS. 
English language and literature.—Grammar, analysis and the writing of a composi- 
tion correct in spelling, punctuation, expression, and division by paragraphs. In 
1892 the subjects for composition were taken from Shakespeare’s As You Like Ht, 
Longfellow’s Courtship of Miles Standish, Irving’s Alhambra, Addison’s Sir Roger 
de Coverley Papers. 
1 From the New York Evening Post, April, 1892.
-P-A-G-E-1220
  2460 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
Mathematics.—Arithmetic, including the metric system of weights and measures, 
plane geometry, five books of Davies’ Legendre or Wentworth’s Geometry, algebra 
as far as quadratic equations. 
Geography.—Physical and political geography, especially that of the continents of 
North America and Europe. 
History.—General history, so much as is contained in Swinton’s Outlines; United 
States history, so much as is contained in Johnston’s History of the United States. 
Physiology and hygiene.—An elementary knowledge, such as is given by any of the 
school text-books ordinarily used. 
Drawing is not insisted on, but it is considered desirable that candidates should be 
able to draw intelligently a group of models and possess a general knowledge of the 
principles of construction and design. 
Graduates of colleges and scientific schools in good standing are admitted without 
examination; also graduates of high schools and academies in the curriculum of 
which all the subjects of the entrance examination are included; and candidates who 
hold a college entrance certificate given by the regents of the University of the State 
of New York. 
Students of both sexes are received on equal footing. 
Departments.—The following departments are now in operation (1892): 
I. Department of the history and institutes of education. 
II. Department of the science and art of teaching. 
III. Department of natural science. 
IV. Department of mechanic arts. 
V. Department of vocal music. 
VI. Department of form study and drawing. 
VII. Department of physical culture. 
VIII. Department of domestic economy. 
IX. School of observation and practice. 
I. The department of the history and institutes of education offers six courses, of 
which the first and third are required of all students. 
Course 1.—Elements of psychology, two periods each week. James’s Briefer 
Course is used as a text-book; but the class is led to base conclusions upon the 
Baconian system of observation and. experiment rather than upon the use of books. 
Course 2.—Deyoted to advanced psychology and pedagogy, two periods each week. 
The aim of this course is to enable students to deal with children as individuals, by 
the application of psychologic principles, and by simple experiments in attention, 
association, imagination, and discrimination. 
Course 38.—Two periods each week for half a year. Studies the principles of educa- 
tion in the light of their development. The text-book is Quick’s Educational 
Reformers, but references are made to works on the history of education, systematic 
pedagogy, general history, and periodical literature. 
Course 4.—One period each week. Takes up the principles of education on the 
basis of Rosenkranz’s Philosophy of Education and Rosmini’s Method in Education, 
with discussions of special topics in pedagogy and psychology. 
Course 5.—Two periods each week. Is occupied with the history of educational 
institutions, theories, methods, and individual educational leaders, with critical read- 
ing of educational classics. 
Course 6.—Gives a-briefer course of elements of psychology. This is a Saturday 
class, and gives an opportunity to teachers who are engaged in the active duties of 
their profession during the week to renew and extend their theoretical studies in 
educational psychology. In this connection opportunity is afforded to advanced stu- 
dents to meet for one hour each week the professors of the department, members of 
the faculty, instructors and resident alumni for reviews of current literature and dis- 
cussion of educational topics. The subjects discussed during the year 1891-92 related 
to the moral development and training of children.

II. In the department of the science and art of teaching there are eight courses, 
which, however, are not mutually exclusive. The first and third are required of all 
students; the second and fourth of all who are candidates for a diploma. The work 
of this department is closely related to that of the preceding, inasmuch as it makes 
a practical application of the philosophical principles therein formulated, and shows 
the connection between theory and practice. Observation and practice at every step 
in the work of the college a¢ecompany theoretical instruction. School organization, 
gradation and classification, courses of school study, and the preparation of pro- 
grammes belong to this department. 
Course 1.—Two periods each week. Methods of teaching language, number, and 
geography; elementary course. 
Course 2.—Two periods each week. Methods of teaching literature, geometry, and 
history; advanced course. 
Course 3.—One period each week. Principles of teaching with special reference to 
the application of the psychology of the feelings and the will to school organization 
and discipline. 
Course 4.—Five periods each week. Practice teaching. 
Course 5.—A Saturday class. Methods of teaching; briefer course. 
Course 6.—A Saturday class, for half the school year. Methods of teaching litera- 
ture in secondary schools; study of typical authors, with discussions of methods, 
devices, and values. 
Course 7.—A Saturday class, for half a year. Methods of teaching history in sec- 
ondary schools; discussion of civil government, practical economics, and the concrete 
study of social problems in their relation to the work of the schools. 
Course 8.—A Saturday class. Methods of teaching Latin; critical reading of typical 
passages from Latin authors; the essentials of etymology and syntax; prose compo- 
sition and Latin rhetoric; meioga: in elementary work. 
III. In the department of natural science the major course aims to prepare students 
to become— 
(1) Teachers of science in State and city normal schools. 
(2) Teachers of science in high schools and academies, 
(3) Supervisors of elementary science instruction in all grades of public schools. 
Candidates for admission must show an ability to comprehend, without instruction 
from the college, the elements of chemistry, physics, physiology, zoology, botany, 
and geology, so far as they can properly be taught in the common schools. Mere 
text-book knowledge is not sufficient. Some reputable laboratory work showing an 
ability to acquire knowledge at first hand is necessary to admission. 
Some of the practical problems on which students labor in this department are 
these: How shall science be taught in public schools where the appropriation for 
equipment is insufficient; how to manage where there is no laboratory and every- 
thing has to be done in the ordinary class room; how pupils in large city schools 
may be brought into contact with nature; how to manage the details of a laboratory; 
how to make experiments educative and not simply a diversion; how to reconcile an 
inflexible prescribed course of study with gratuitous information and illpstrative 
experiments. 
The head of the deparment and his assistants give the entire instruction in science 
in the school of observation and practice in the presence of the college students. 
Major students in this department observe this teaching at least nine periods a week 
during the year, making a selection, after consultation with the head of the depart- 
ment, from the following programme: 
Chemistry, twice a week, each lesson eighty minutes. 
Physics, twice a week, each lesson eighty-five minutes. 
Zoology and physiology, twice a week, each lesson eighty-five minutes. 
Botany and geology, twice a week, each lesson eighty-five minutes. 
Nature lessons, in lower grades, once a week, each lesson thirty-five minutes. 
    
-P-A-G-E-1222
  2462 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
  A lecture on methods of teaching science is given once a week. Speci ruction 
in the art of experimenting and ii the construction of home-made apparatus is given 
once a week, and two periods a week in individual laboratory practice are required 
from every student.in this course. A major course in science thus includes fourteen 
periods a week for one year, and a few weeks of practice teaching in the second year. 
A minor course in science is arranged for students who desire a side light for 
courses in other departments of the college, or who seek preparation to teach some 
one science or to give object lessons in connection with the work of elementary 
schools. It consists of selections from the work offered in the major course. 
On Saturdays, from October to Easter, a lecture on methods of teaching natural 
science is given to teachers of New York City and the vicinity. 
IV. The department of mechanic arts offers seven courses: 
Course 1.—Four periods a week of eighty-five minutes each. A course in mechan- 
ical drawing designed for students who desire a practical knowledge of drawing and 
for those who intend to teach drawing in grammar and high schools. 
Course 2.—Two periods a week. Mechanical drawing; in advanced courses. 
Course 3.—Four to ten periods a week. In woodworking; (@) a course in mechan- 
ical drawing and woodworking for elementary schools which ean be performed in 
the ordinary schoolroom at any school desk; and (b) a course of joinery and ele- 
mentary wood carving suitable for grammar and high schools. : 
Course 4.—Four to eight periods a week. An adyanced course involving joinery, 
carving, turning, and pattern making. 
Course 5.—A. Saturday class for teachers whe can not attend the regular classes; 
an abridgment of course 3. 
Course 6.—Two periods a week. Given to the construction of simple apparatus 
for scientifie experiments. ‘ 
Course 7.—Four periods a week. Wood carving; a study in wood of some typical 
ancient and modern relief designs. 
A conference of instructors and students in this department is held once a week to. 
discuss important questions relating to drawing and manual training. 
Y. In the department of vocal nvusie the tonie sol-fa system is employed asa means 
of training and developing the musical powers of the student, and also as the best 
medium for leading to an intelligent understanding of the staff notation. Two periods 
a week for one year are devoted to this study. 
VI. The department of form study and drawing comprises a systematic course of 
study in the models and type forms given to children in the three years of the pri- 
mary school, modeling in clay, elementary decoration in the arrangement of simple 
geometric figures, cutting these figures from colored paper and pasting them, studies 
belonging to the kindergarten and primary schools especially, but useful as a founda- 
tion for more adyanced teaching. "Students who desire to become special teachers of 
form should be able on entering the college to’ pass an examination in free-hand 
drawing and light and shade. 
The advanced course in this department embraces constructive drawing, patterns 
of typical solids, decorativé drawing, conventional plant forms, drawing in charcoal, 
examples of ornaments in water colors, study of the schools of historic ornament, 
and principles of design. Throughout the course it is steadily kept in view that the 
purpose is not to make artists, but to train students to become teachers of drawing. 
The time devoted to this work is four periods a week for one year. 
VIII. The department.of domestic economy is maintained as a part of the manual- 
training system of the college. The major course covers two years, the first year 
being devoted to psychology and methods of teaching (six periods a week), and 
chemistry and physiology with laboratory work (twelve periods a week). The sec- 
ond year gives four periods a week to physies and household hygiene, and fifteen 
periods a week to cooking, sewing, and practice teaching. 
 
-P-A-G-E-1223
NORMAL SCHOOLS IN THE UNITED STATES. 2463 
It will be noticed that the same professional training is given in this department 
as in other departments of the college. After attending lectures on psychology and 
methods of teaching, the student in the second year teaches classes in the model 
school, under the supervision of the professor of science and art of teaching, before 
teaching classes in cooking and sewing. By the study of physics and chemistry in 
connection with domestic economy the student acquires habits of close observation 
and careful experimenting and learns how to apply scientific methods to kitchen 
work. The course of six periods a week for one year includes practice in all branches 
of cookery; but more attention is given to economical and wholesome cooking than 
to the preparation of elaborate dishes. Students learn to operate with coal, gasoline, 
and kerosene, as well as with gas. In all the processes the aim is to study the con- 
ditions and learn to control them until uniform results are obtained. 
Two periods a week are given to sewing—instructions in plain hand sewing, mak- 
ing patterns, study of textile fabrics and their manufacture, observation of sewing 
lessons given by an expert teacher, and practice teaching. 
An elementary course in cooking or sewing may be elected by regular students 
who desire to equip themselves as broadly as possible for general school work. 
IX. The Horace Mann School is related to the New York College for the Training 
of Teachers as its school of observation and practice. In this department every stage 
in the school life of a child, from the kindergarten through the high school, is 
represented, and the complete curriculum may be studied as one organic whole. The 
proper adaptation and adjustment of the school of theory to the school of practice 
has long been felt to be the crucial task in the arrangement of the normal-school 
curriculum. So difficult has been this problem that some schools have never 
attempted the solution; some have made the attempt and have abandoned it; some 
have accomplished the feat—on paper; some have established a school of practice 
without observation, and some a school of observation without practice; while some 
are still conscientiously strugggling with the experiment, and realizing that the 
‘school of observation and practice’’ is like a loose tooth, more noticed for the pain 
it creates than for the service it renders. The New York College seems to have 
succeeded in solving the difficult problem. It has reversed the usual conditions, and 
in place of instruction with incidental training, it gives training with incidental 
instruction. In many normal schools, though the number is growing smaller, the 
students consider every hour not given to class recitations as so much time lost; but 
in schools like the New York College the time given to observation and practical 
teaching is felt to be all gain. 
Students receive their practical training in the several grades of the Horace Mann. 
School—the kindergarten, the intermediate school, the grammar school, and the high 
school. None are admitted to the kindergarten except such as present a high-school 
certificate, or its equivalent, or pass the entrance examination to the college. The 
course covers two years, and includes the theory of Froebel’s system, psychology, 
kindergarten gifts and occupations, songs and games, vocal music by the tonic sol-fa 
method, form study and drawing, clay modeling and color, physical culture, and 
practice teaching. 
Degrees.—It was formerly intended that the full course of the college should lead 
up to the degree of bachelor of pedagogy, but this degree has never been given by the 
college, and, under the conditions on which Columbia takes charge of it, probably 
never will be. The college diploma is conferred upon such students as have com- 
pleted a course of study covering two years, as follows: 
Required: 
Department of history and institutes of education .

In the session of 1891-92 there were in attendance 119 regular students and 96 
special, with 264 pupils in the school of observation and practice. For their instruc- 
tion and government there were 11 professors, 2 lecturers, and 21 instructors and 
other officers.? 
The New York College for the Training of Teachefs (says the New York Evening 
Post, in April, 1892) is not to be considered as an individual institution whose chief 
influence is confined to its own students and to the schools that these students enter 
as teachers, although it has already drawn its students from 18 States, and numbers 
among them both experienced teachers and graduates of colleges. This college is to 
be regarded as a type, an object lesson, and an experiment station. There are not 
Jacking evidences that by its aggressive work it has helped to elevate standards in 
many quarters and to stimulate and guide the progress of educational reform. 
Applying the principle of extension, the college has organized classes for the study 
of the kindergarten system in New York and in neighboring cities and towns and 
has sent specialists in manual training to numerous schools in the vicinity, so that 
more than 2,000 pupils are now under this instruction in 17 places within 50 mil 
of this city. By this means and through correspondence and independent inv 
gation, the principles and methods of the college are being diffused over the country. 
The interest and approbation with which its development is watched by eminent 
educators are signified by the strongest testimony from the highest sources?

Several of these have already been noticed in these pages under the caption of 
“Colored Normal Schools.’ 
The number of normal students, ‘“‘pupils in the science and art of teaching,”’ is 
given in the report as 4,487, and it is to be noted that about half of these are found 
in two schools, one in Indiana and the other in Iowa. 
Of the 46 schools, 20 report no graduates for the year 1888-89; the remaining 26 
report 315 graduates. The number of graduates for that year is, therefore, 7 per

cent of the whole number of students in attendance, or, rather, the whole number 
enrolled. 
One of these schools was opened in 1833; 5 between 1865 and 1869 (both inclu- 
sive); 16 between 1870 and 1879, and 24 between 1880 and 1888. 
The most prominent must be regarded simply as business enterprises, and not as 
normal schools properly so called. They propose to fill a known want; they are con~ 
ducted on business principles, and should be judged by business standards. They- 
receive all who apply for admission, and base their claims to public patronage om 
the ground that they give good value for the money received. A fair idea of their 
business methods may be obtained from a perusal of their catalogues and circulars. 
A few specimens are given, the names being withheld for obvious reasons: 
A. ‘Our courses of study are the best arranged and best carried out of any private 
normal in this country.’ ‘They are especially adapted to the preparation of men 
and women for entering the study of law, medicine, the ministry, and editorial life.’* 
“No more desirable location for a school can be found anywhere.”’ ‘There are: 
many cultivated people who are prejudiced against private normals. This is very 
natural when we consider the number and character of many schools of this kind.’” 
“Tn making your decision examine courses of study and decide at once against any 
school that promises to do thirty weeks’ work in ten weeks.” “The men who have: 
been in the institution since the present management took hold of it are teachers: 
thoroughly prepared for their work in point of scholarship. In no sense were they 
place hunters. All were successful teachers.”? ‘The school is unexcelled in its: 
mathematical, language, philosophical, chemical, and pedagogical departments, as 
compared with similar institutions. Our students who have attended elsewhere are: 
foremost in their praise of this institution.’”? ‘If you complete our course you will 
be well fitted for any position in life.’’? ‘‘We have better buildings, better laboratory, 
and better location than our competitors. Our cow: are more thoroughly carried: 
out. We advertise nothing extravagantly. We claim that no normal school in the: 
United States has a stronger course than ours, and that no school can offer as good 
advantages at so low a price. Students are allowed to enter any of the courses at: 
any place, with the understanding that they are liable to be put back if the faculty 
decides they are not qualified to go on. We say come, and if, after you have given: 
us a trial, yon don’t like the school, you shall have your money.” 
This school has 13 teachers in addition to the president, and advertises a prepara-- 
tory course, a teachers’ course, one year; a scientific course, two years; a ¢ 
course, three years; with a musical department, a commercial department, a fine-art: 
department, and a phonographic department. The number of students is betweem 
400 and 500. 
B. ‘The location is one of the best in the United States.” ‘No place could be 
found anywhere better suited for being the seat of a flourishing school than ‘B.’’” 
“*Jt is noted forits remarkably healthy climate. Duringall the history of the schook 
there have been but two deaths among the students. Many who come here weak 
and sickly go away strong and well.”” “‘ The building is not surpassed by any nor-~ 
mal school in the West.”” ‘An education can be secured here in three years which 
will better fit a student for success in life than is generally received irom colleges in 
six years.” ‘The teachers’ course as presented in this school is one of the most 
complete courses of study offered by any school.’ ‘‘ Not only does this course prepare- 
teachers for their great work, but it gives all who take it such thorough and practi-~ 
cal training in the various branches, such honesty, genuineness, and individuality i 
his [sic] work, such strength and force of character, and such mental discipline as- 
will enable him to take up any line and pursue it successfully.’? ‘Those complet- 
ing this course in a sd ctory manner will be awarded a handsome diploma.’ 
“The faculty are all specially qualified for their distinctive lines of work. They are- 
known to be ladies and gentlemen of the highest moral character.’ ‘Pupils are:

admitted to the school without examination and take any classes that they feel able 
to take.” ‘Its name and influence is always a great aid to its students for securing 
good paying positions.” 
This school offers a preparatory course, a teachers’ course, a scientific course, a 
classical course, a business course, anda shorthand and typewriting course. Thereare 
9 teachers, with an enrollment of about 250 students. The school has changed pro- 
prietors five times in ten years. 
C is a stupendous institution and counts its annual enrollment by the thousand. 
“It is practical and meets the demands of the times.” “‘It is the best established, 
most widely known independent normal school in the West.” “Its reputation is 
sufficient to secure ready employment for its graduates, and more students of ‘C’ are 
filling responsible positions than from any other.”” ‘‘The expenses at this school are 
less than at most schools.” ‘‘We do as good work in every way as schools that 
charge twice and thrice as much, and incomparably more than most schools whose 
expenses are about the same.’”’ ‘‘ Our graduates have made from $4,000 to $12,000 
in the length of time that would have elapsed after they had completed the work 
here and before they had completed the same work in other colleges that do their 
work more slowly, but not more thoroughly than ours.” 
“No examinations are required for admission to any course or department in the 
college.’”? ‘‘You can come at any time and find just such classes as you desire.” 
“We have the following well-equipped departments with an excellent faculty for 
each department: Classical, scientific, normal, common school, teachers’ professional, 
review, elocutionary, civil engineering, business, pen art, phonographie, telegraphic, 
musical (piano, voice, organ, including pipe organ, guitar, violin, band, and orchestra), 
art, physical training. The members of the faculty are specialists in their respective 
departments.” 
“You can make no mistake by attending ‘C.’ If not as represented in this 
announcement, money will be refunded.’’ ‘‘Don’t pay extravagant school bills, 
but come to the cheapest, best school in the country.”’ ‘Our students almost inva- 
riably leave school in better health than when they enter.” 
D. ‘‘‘D’ is the best place to obtain an edu Every year it grows better. 
Its methods are the b its instructors are experienced, cultured, and successful; 
its expenses are as low as is consistent with proper living and instruction.’”’ ‘‘ Now is 
the accepted time. The ‘D’ school offers a rare chance to obtain an excellent edu- 
cation. The time and money will be well spent, and we guarantee that you can not 
find elsewhere better inducements.” ‘‘ Only teachers of ability and successful experi- 
ence are employed. We confidently assert that no similar institution can furnish 
instruction superior to that afforded by ‘D.’ We know that our methods are the 
best, the most conformable to the fundamental laws of education, and hence the most 
successful that can be employed.” 
“ We advertise nothing that we do not have.” [The italics are in the original. ] 
“*1D? invites all classes of pupils. Teachers, pupils from the common schools, 
young men and women preparing for business pursuits, or wishing to acquire a 
musical education, high-school graduates—all classes attend the normal at ‘D,’ and 
find work suited to their needs. No young man or woman, however backward in 
his studies, need feel any hesitation in enrolling among its pupils, as it adapts its 
work in the common branches largely to that class of students.’’ 
“No examinations are required to enter ‘D.’ Students upon entering will be 
assigned rank in the course they wish to pursue, according to previous preparation. 
Our work is so arranged that those entering in the middle of a term can find just 
such classes as they desire.”’ 
‘D’ has five teachers besides the principal. In the ‘literary department”’ it 
presents three courses—preparatory, teachers’ advanced, and scientifie. The follow- 
ing is the curriculum of the teachers’ advanced course :

NORMAL SCHOOLS IN THE UNITED STATES. — 2467 
First term.—Natural philosophy, algebra, didactics, zoology, rhetoric, elocution. 
Second term.—Natural philosophy, algebra, history of education, general history, 
elocution, rhetoric, and composition. 
Third term.—General history, algebra, mental philosophy, plane geometry, vocal 
music. 
Fourth term.—Botany, algebra, English and American literature, didactics, oration. 
Ten weeks constitute a term. 
E. ‘Our facilities are the very best, and our rates defy competition.” ‘In any 
case where pupils hesitate about coming to us on the ground that they are not suffi- 
ciently well advanced, we would like to say that such persons will be more highly 
benefited than others. The majority of our young people are of moderate scholar- 
ship. All pupils of whatever grade can be aceommodated.’”’ ‘‘ The school employs 
only the best men and women as teachers in every department.”’ ‘‘ The classes are 
so arranged that students who may not be able to complete a full course in any 
department may enter at any time, study what is most desirable, and get full credit 
for what they accomplish.” ‘‘ Pupils can enter at any time with the assurance of 
finding classes suited to their needs.”’ 
“The managers of teachers’ agencies tell us repeatedly that they can locate our 
graduates and undergraduates with much less difficulty than pupils from other sec- 
tions.” ‘Our graduates and undergraduates have passed the severest tests and 
al with the highest credit. They have met in closest competition the represent- 
atives of the best schools for pesitions in all walks of life, and have invariably sus- 
tained themselves. So true is this that the fact has become widely known, and the 
demand upon us for trained teachers is much greater than we can meet. Our best 
pupils are everywhere commanding higher salaries than others for the same grade of 
work.” 
“The young people trained in ‘E’ secure their positions more readily and give 
much better satisfaction than those trained in other sections.”’ 
“Teachers? course.—Ten weeks, arithmetic, geography, English grammar, theory 
and practice, spelling; ten weeks, physiology, mental science, history, theory and 
practice, penmanship.”’ 
The number of students registered in this course (catalogue of 1887) is 152. 
The other courses and departments advertised are preparatory, engineering, com- 
mercial, music, scientific, elocution, and classic. The number of teachers is 12. 
F is a “‘County normal school;”’ that is, an educational enterprise on business prin- 
ciples, having close relations with the school administration of the county. It was 
opened in 1870, and in 1892 had 318 pupils, of whom 248 were ‘‘normal,’’ 56 in the 
high school, and 14 preparatory. The normal course extends through two years. 
The high school covers four. The normal studies of the first year are arithmetic, 
grammar, geography, history, reading, spelling, and physiology; art of school man- 
agement, algebra, civil government, bookkeeping, Latin (elective), Shakespeare. 
The additional studies in the second year are geometry, literature, rhetoric, natural 
philosophy, botany, and mental philosophy. 
“Before the establishment of this school many parents who wished to educate 
their children and who were not able to send them to college or State normal schools 
were compelled to keep them at home and confine their education to the narrow 
limits the district school then afforded. But this institution now offers them the 
same advantages as the State normal schools, with only half the expense. The 
teachers who have gone forth from this school have rendered universal satisfaction, 
and they have won for themselves and for the school at which they received their 
training a flattering reputation. Our teachers are in demand and are commanding 
the best positions and highest salaries paid in the county. The school boards in a 
number of townships have paid the school the high compliment of refusing to hire 
any teachers but those it has prepared. During the past year [1892] every township 
       
-P-A-G-E-1228
  2468 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-99. 
was represented in the school, and more than three-fourths of the whole number of 
teachers in the county were in attendance. This class [class in theory and practice 
of teaching] is under the supervision of the county superintendent, who is careful to 
make his instruction so effectual that the number of failures in our common schools 
may be brought down to the lowest number possible. Connected with the normal 
school is a model school of 50 pupils. Students are required to teach and criticise 
in this department until they are perfectly familiar with the best methods of teach- 
ing primary schools.” 
F is one of the youngest of the ‘‘independent normals.’’ It is a “‘normal univer- 
sity.’ It presents a full assortment of courses, schools, and colleges, some in pree- 
senti, some in futuro—a preparatory school, a school of elocution, a school of fine 
arts, a school of music, a school of phonography and typewriting, a school of teleg- 
raphy, a college of teachers, a college of science, a college of literature or modern 
languages, a college of philosophy, a college of liberal arts, a college of business, a 
college of engineering and surveying, and colleges of law and medicine. The object 
of the college of teachers is to prepare young men and women thoroughly and 
speedily to teach a country school and all classes of a graded school up to the high 
school, and to pass the requisite county examinations for a certificate. The time 
required for this preparation is ‘‘ two or three terms of eight weeks each.”” We learn 
from the catalogue (1890) that ‘‘I’’ ‘is authorized by law to issue diplomas and 
confer degrees usually conferred by educational institutions ;’’ that it does not ‘depend 
on examinations, quarterly or annual, as giving any desirable or healthy stimulus to 
vigorous effort; that ‘‘here there is nothing to attract the attention from his work, 
and [he] has no less than twelve hours a day to devote to study,’”’ and that ‘‘all the 
teachers employed are of recognized ability.” 
The following gives the courses of study in probably the largest independent 
normal school in the United States. It will be noticed that the normal course proper 
occupies but one year of forty-eight weeks:

CATHOLIC NORMAL SCHOOL OF THE HOLY FAMILY AND PIO NONO COLLEGE. 
This school is located at St. Francis, 2 miles south of the city limits of Milwaukee, 
near Lake Michigan. It was founded in 1870 by Dr. Joseph Satzmann. The aim of 
the instruction given in the normal school, as stated in the catalogue of 1890, is (1) 
to ground the student in the knowledge and practice of Catholic faith; (2) to provide 
means of acquiring useful general knowledge; (3) to give such specific training as 
will best fit for work in theschoolroom. Students who complete the normal course of 
four years and otherwise show fitness to be intrusted with the instruction of children 
receive a diploma. 
The following is the course of study: 
First year.—Christian doctrine; Bible history; English; German; arithmetic; geog- 
raphy; penmanship; drawing; music. 
Second year.—Christian doctrine; Bible history; English; German; arithmetic; 
United States history and civil government; physiology; drawing; music. 
Third year.—Christian doctrine; Bible history; English; German; general history; 
natural science; algebra; elocution; pedagogy; music. 
Fourth year.—Liturgy; general and ecclesiastical history; literature; English; Ger- 
man; natural science; geometry; pedagogy; music. 
The aim of the work in pedagogy is to familiarize the student with the best educa- 
tional methods of the present day. A course in psychology and science of educa- 
tion forms the basis of the work. The organization, classification, and management 
of numbers, the requirements in a course of study adapted to the capacity and wants 
of children in the parish schools, the relation of the teacher to the pastor and to the 
congregation, and his duties and responsibilities as a citizen are discussed in lectures, 
supplemented by a text-book. 
This is one of the few normal schools in the United States open to young men 
exclusively. The register for 1889-90 contains the names of thirty-two normal 
students.?

  CHAPTER L. 
PORTABLE SCHOOL BUILDINGS. 
[From the Annual Report of the Superintendent of Instruction of St. Louis, Mo, (Hon. F. Louis 
Soldan), for 1898-99, p. 51.] 
It seems advisable to provide a remedy for the trouble which the board have 
experienced in regard to this matter [of double daily sessions] in the past. It can 
not be the policy of the board to provide school room in advance before the neces- 
sity of it is felt in any part of the city. After a school, however, has become over- 
crowded and a new building has been decided upon, a year must necessarily pass 
before it can be completed and occupied. During this year temporary provision must 
be made for the surplus of children. In the city of Milwaukee the plan of portable 
school buildings for temporary purposes has been tried with satisfaction for many 
years. The idea of portable school buildings seems to have originated in Paris, when, 
after the Franco-Prussian War, a compulsory education law was passed, and the sud- 
den influx of children into the publie schools of that metropolis was so large that 
existing schoolhouses could not take care of the number. Under these circum- 
stances the plan of temporary school buildings was tried and was found to meet the 
emergency. Several other large European cities, such as Munich, have tried this plan 
with good success. Ata cost hardly greater than the rental of an adequate room for 
two years, such buildings, large enough to accommodate 50 children, well ventilated 
and heated and protected from cold by doubie walls, can be erected, and I believe 
they would present better sanitary conditions for the temporary accommodation of 
children than the ordinary rented rooms and would be much better economy than 
double-time sessions. They could be put into the yards of the school buildings that 
need relief and make use of the outhouses and of the janitor service provided for the 
main building.     
  [From the Annual Report of the Commissioner cf School Buildings of St. Louis, Mo. (Mr. William 
B..Ittner), for 1898-99.] 
PORTABLE SCHOOLROOMS. 
Iam pleased to report a successful trial of the portable schoolroom. Beginning 
with the present board (in June, 1897), a large number of rented rooms were main- 
tained in various parts of the city. The addition of new school buildings has enabled 
the board to reduce the number of rented rooms at this time to 19. These rented 
rooms, though the best that can be procured in the neighborhood of the school 
needing relief, are at best ill adapted to the requirements, are expensive to fit up for 
school purposes and to restore to their original condition when given up. The build- 
ing deyised to relieve temporarily the overcrowded condition at any school will 
enable the board to properly provide for such overflow and, with the proper number 
of portable rooms on hand, to dispense with rented rooms entirely. 
The buildings are constructed in such manner as will enable them to be readily 
taken apart where no longer required at one school and moyed to another. They

are 24 by 36 feet, inside measurement, with a clear story height of 12 feet. The 
floor is constructed in 8 sections, the sides in 6 sections, the ends in 4 sections, and 
the pitched roof in 16 sections. Each section is built upon frames which are readily 
bolted together in such manner as to make a perfectly tight and secure room. All 
joints between the sections are covered both inside and out by movable pieces 
secured with screws. They are heated and ventilated by an indirect furnace with 
double casing. The fresh air is taken directly from the outside, which supply can 
not be cut off by the teacher. The vent is erected at the opposite end of the room 
from the furnace, and the draft of the vent is induced by carrying the smoke pipe 
from the furnace through the upper part of the vent flue. “This not only makes a 
perfect method of ventilation, but effectually prevents any possibility of fire from 
the furnace smoke pipe. A test of the ventilation of the first room, set up at the 
Walnut Park school, shows that the air of the room is being changed every 9.74 
minutes, thus supplying each of the pupils with 16 cubic feet of fresh warm air per 
minute. 
The buildings thus far completed have been erected by our own carpenters, the 
cost being as follows:

The rooms can readily be taken apart, moved, and reerected. They are fitted with 
60 adjustable desks, and in all respects make a satisfactory and comfortable school 
room. 
[From letter of Mr. William B, Itiner, commissioner of school buildings, June 14, 1900.] 
I will add this description of the heating and ventilating apparatus, which is not 
explicitly covered in my report: 
The furnace is known to the trade asa ‘‘room heater’’ and weighs 450 pounds. It 
has an outer casing (for appearance) of Russia iron; the exposed chimney in the 
claes room being also of Russia iron. The inner casing surrounding the furnace is of 
heavy stovepipe iron; the same being corrugated and set with about a 1}-inch air 
space between the inner and outer casing. 
There is a row of 1-inch holes 3 inches apart through the outer casing just above 
the floor. This permits of a good circulation of air through the space between the 
casings and assists materially in keeping the outer casing cool. 
We place a door about 6 by 12 inches on each side of the casing near the floor, so 
that when the room is not occupied, these doors can be opened up and the room 
quickly warmed before the fresh-air inlets are opened. We cover the top of the fur- 
nace with a No. 8 wire screen, to prevent mischievous youngsters from throwing 
papers, etc., over the casings. This has been found convenient also in suburban 
schools to warm coffee and the children’s lunch. 
The fresh airis brought in through a wood duct under the floor. The duct extends 
to both sides of the building, permitting the air to enter from both sides. Doors can 
be arranged to be opened and closed from the room by means of chain and pulley, 
giving the teacher easy control of the quantity of fresh air to be admitted. 
‘The outer openings should, of course, be covered with heavy wire screens. The 
space in the floor under the heater is cut out for the admission of fresh air around 
the casing of the furnace and inside of the inner casing. The floor joists under the 
   
-P-A-G-E-1259

heater are protected by wrapping them with several layers of asbestus paper and 
then covering them with stovepipe iron. 
The vent outlet is placed at the opposite end of the room alongside of the book 
closet. While this location may not seem the correct position for the vent opening, 
yet tests of this apparatus have proved a thorough circulation of air throughout the 
entire room. By passing the smokepipe over the furnace through the vent flue, the 
air in that part of the flue is heated, thereby inducing and maintaining a constant 
flow of air through the room at all times. 
Tests of the heater have shown that the air of the room can be changed every 
seven minutes; that the temperature varies only two degrees from maximum to 
ininimum, using six thermometers, one of which was placed on the teacher’s desk, 
the other five distributed about the room,

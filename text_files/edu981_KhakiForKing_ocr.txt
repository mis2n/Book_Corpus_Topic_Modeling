  Dear Boys,— 
The following pages, written often under diffi- 
culties in brief spells off duty, are, alas! not fiction, but 
the hard, naked truth. The two heroes are just ordinary 
youths, the prototypes of whom you may meet by the 
score any day you choose to walk from the Bank to the 
Marble Arch. The events described took place a few hours’ 
, journey from the shores of Great Britain. To-day big guns 
are belching forth death and destruction. British lads are 
dying heroes’ deaths. Great Britain is writing an immortal 
tale upon the pages of history, almost within sight of the 
cliffs of Dover. 
Similar events to those enacted in Belgium might—nay, 
would have happened in your own country had not Belgium 
broken the rush, had not your immortal countrymen given 
their lives to save you and yours, while those gallant men 
who nobly responded to the call were preparing to face 
the foe. 
The civilised world is threatened by a barbaric invasion. 
What Attila, the ancient Hun, was to the world in the fifth 
century, that would Wilhelm, the modern Hun, be in the 
twentieth century. 
It is up to you boys of to-day to see that a similar danger 
never threatens your glorious Empire again. Those of you 
who have not yet donned khaki, see to it that when you 
are old enough you train yourselves to defend your homes, 
your mothers, your sisters, your country, all that you hold 
dear ; so that, should another such world scourge as Germany 
ever threaten us again, you will be ready at an hour’s notice 
to take your places in the ranks in your tens of thousands, 
and so crush the monster ere it has gorged itself with the 
blood of innocent women and children, and turned prosper- 
ous countries into howling wildernesses, as have the German 
barbarians of to-day. And believe one whose proud privilege 
it has been to wear the King’s uniform, that those days you 
will spend in khaki or in blue will be amongst the fullest 
and happiest of your lives.—Your sincere friend, :

  IN KHAKI FOR THE KING. 
CHAPTER I. 
A BRAWL IN THE PALM GARDEN. 
‘AR, war, war! It was in the air; the press 
spoke of nothing else; it was the one topic 
of conversation. Germany resounded to the tread 
of feet, the clang of hoofs, the rumble of wheels. 
The great German war machine was working ; roads 
were crowded, railway stations packed; yet there 
was no fuss, no hitch, no stop. In perfect order, 
horse, foot, and artillery were pouring in count- 
less thousands to the frontiers of France and 
Russia. 
It had all happened with,the suddenness of a bolt 
from the blue. On 28th June 1914 the heir to the 
Austrian throne, the Archduke Francis Ferdinand, 
and his wife had been killed by bombs in the streets 
of Sarajevo. The bombs had come from the Ser- 
bian army factory; Serbian officers were said to 
be implicated in the plot. In consequence Austria 
presented an ultimatum to Serbia, which at once 
appealed to Russia, but accepted all the terms of the 
ultimatum except those which denied her rights as 
an independent sovereign state. Austria immedi- 
A

ately declared war. This was the signal for Russia 
to mobilise, but Britain was working tooth and nail 
for peace. Germany, however, acting, as was her 
wont, behind the scenes, was determined there 
should be no peace. Long had she drunk ‘To the 
Day !’—and the ‘Day’ had arrived ! 
In face of the Russian mobilisation, Austria was 
ready to draw back, to listen to Britain’s plea for 
peace ; but Germany had decided for war, and the 
military caste, headed by the egotistic Kaiser and 
the shallow Crown Prince, threw all discretion to the 
winds, and at five o'clock on Ist August declared 
war on Russia. That same day, France, being 
asked by Germany what were her intentions, replied 
that she proposed to consult her own interests. 
Thus was the world set in a blaze. The day had 
come, and Germany and Austria were at war with 
France, Russia, and Serbia. Of Great Britain 
nothing had yet been said; but her time was to 
come when France and Russia had been humbled 
to the dust! So argued the Kaiser Wilhelm, War 
Lord of Europe. 
Thus it came about that from Frankfort-on-the- 
Main, famous as much for the tremendous develop- 
ment of the modern town as for its old-world 
interest, the 18th Army Corps had been pouring 
ever northwards to join those other army corps 
that were going to wipe out of existence the forces 
of the Czar of all the Russias. 
The German Army was going forth to astonish 
the world with the lessons learnt at Potsdam, at 
Coblenz, and at Berlin; the countless thousands 
of arrogant officers, only a tiny fraction of 
~whom had ever heard a shot fired in anger, were
-P-A-G-E-11

going to show Europe how to wage a_ successful 
war. And*the war was popular ; for was not the 
German Army invincible? And so on Saturday, 
1st August, all was gaiety in Frankfort, and the 
beautiful Palm Garden was crowded with people. The 
weather was perfect; the crowd was enthusiastic ; 
a military band was discoursing popular music; and 
all was light, life, and brightness. 
At one of the marble-topped tables was a group 
of four people. Three were young Germans in 
uniform ; the fourth was a youth clad in a gray 
lounge suit and straw hat, whose sunburnt, clear- 
cut features were unmistakably English. Oliver 
Hastings was as English as his clothes or his name, 
but for all that he chattered German as volubly as 
his three companions, and with but very little 
foreign accent. His father, Major Hastings, had 
been Military Attaché in Berlin; and Oliver had 
spent his early years in Germany, thus learning the 
language in his childhood like a native. 
After six years at Rugby, during which time he 
had been a very enthusiastic member of the Officers’ 
Training Corps, he had put in a year at Heidelberg, 
where he had made the acquaintance of Ludwig 
von Lenz and Moritz Falkenberg, and between him 
and the first-named real friendship had\sprung up. 
Ludwig had left Heidelberg to do his one year’s 
service with the army, having passed the Gymnasium 
examination and qualified as an Hinjdhrige.* 
Falkenberg had passed into the army from a 
Cadet School, and meant making it the profession 
of his life. { 
The third man, who wore the showy uniform of

  4 A BRAWL IN THE PALM GARDEN. 
the Garde Uhlan Regiment, was the oldest of the 
four, and was a stranger to Hastings. 
‘The war will be just a picnic for us,’ said Moritz 
Falkenberg, who wore the bright blue of the 
Queen’s Grenadier Regiment. He was tall, broad, 
and very fair, with china-blue eyes. 
‘War is never exactly a picnic, I should say,’ 
said Hastings; ‘it has its terrible side.’ 
‘You always look at things in your cold English 
way,’ laughed Von Lenz, who wore the dark uniform 
of the Ziethen Hussars ; ‘you don’t see the romance, 
the glory of war.’ 
‘No, Ludwig; I admit I look upon war as a 
terrible thing.’ 
‘As well you might, for your country is not 
prepared to wage it,’ said the Uhlan officer, whose 
name was Otto Dous. 
Hastings looked at the dark-featured speaker, 
whom he had met that day for the first time, and 
to whom he had taken an instinctive dislike. 
‘“We’ve waged a good many wars, sir,’ he said 
hotly. 
‘Bah! Against whom? Blacks, savages, peaceful 
farmers. You haven’t met trained troops for sixty 
years.’ 
‘But whenever we have, we have always beaten 
them.’ 
‘Generally with the help of other nations, though. 
And the England of to-day, with its ridiculous, 
foppish middle class and its football-watching lower 
class, is not the England of a hundred years ago.’ 
Upon which Von Lenz, with a laugh, broke in 
with, ‘A truce to all bickering. Here’s to the 
success of our arms, to our speedy entrance into
-P-A-G-E-13
A BRAWL IN THE PALM GARDEN, 5 
Paris, and our quick return to smash up unholy 
Russia.” 
All four raised their glasses. The other Germans 
echoed Von Lenz’s' words, but Oliver said, ‘Here ’s 
good luck and a safe return to you, Ludwig, and 
to you, Moritz,’ and then sipped his wine. 
‘I perceive you don’t drink our toast, sir,’ cried 
Lieutenant Dous fiercely. 
‘As an Englishman, I have no animosity against 
either France or Russia.’ 
‘Nor friendship for Germany, I presume.’ 
‘I have many German friends.’ 
‘Whom I dare say you are quite ready to 
betray.’ 
‘Herr Lieutenant’ began Oliver, when Von 
Lenz, determined to avoid disagreement, cried, ‘ For 
shame, Dous! Hastings is a friend of mine and 
an honourable gentleman, as I have ever found his 
countrymen, We cannot expect him to see things 
through our eyes. Call for another bottle of 
Rudheimer, Moritz, for who can say when we shall 
meet again, if ever?’ / 
Peace was maintained ; but Otto Dous was clearly 
in an aggressive mood, and took no pains to conceal 
his dislike and contempt for both Britain and the 
British. : 
, ‘At least you will admit that our quarrel is just,’ 
he said presently to Oliver. ‘Serbia is a nest of 
murderers. Their King Peter is an assassin with 
the blood of King George and Queen Draga on his 
hands. He was, I believe, privy to the assassination 
of the Austrian Grand Duke and Duchess.’ 
“Surely that is a question which could be settled 
by arbitration.’  
-P-A-G-E-14
6 A BRAWL IN THE PALM GARDEN. 
‘Then why does Russia push herself into the 
business ?’ 
‘Weaker states must be protected; and if Berlin 
had really wished peace I think she might have 
maintained it.’ 
‘Weaker states—bah !’ and, ignoring the last 
part of Oliver's remark, Lieutenant Dous shrugged 
his shoulders. ‘We shall smash France; then we 
will reckon with Russia; and if almighty Eng- 
land dares to interfere, then—we shall see,’ he 
concluded. 
Once more Von Lenz interposed. ‘There will 
be no question of British interference, will there, 
Oliver ?’ he said. ‘There is no real undertaking 
to support France. And what about the civil war 
in Ireland ?’ 
‘About France I don’t know, Ludwig; but as 
to Ireland, there is no civil war, nor will there be. 
But even did such a condition exist, it would cease 
at once if we were threatened by a common enemy, 
and Nationalist and Ulsterman would fight side 
by side for the common cause.’ 
Dous smiled sarcastically under his dark mous- 
tache. ‘That’s what your politicians say,’ he 
sneered; ‘but, for all that, there is civil war in 
Ireland, and you dare not move a regiment out of 
England. Your colonies are seething with dis- 
content, too. I tell you this war has happened at 
the right moment.’ 
‘You seem strangely conversant with British 
affairs,’ said Oliver, whose anger was rising. 
‘It is our business to know everything, even to 
the exact numbers of your toy army.’ 
‘Well, sir, I hope, for the safety of your skin,
-P-A-G-E-15
A BRAWL IN THE PALM GARDEN. us 
that you will never run up against that army,’ said 
Oliver grimly. 
‘Pooh! we should blow it away, march over 
it. What is it composed of ? Mercenary rascals 
who fight for gold. What patriotism can you 
expect from such? And the officers are empty- 
headed fops with little training, whose one idea 
is sport or pleasure. I know them; I have mixed 
with them; I’ 
‘Look here,’ cried Oliver, now thoroughly angry ; 
‘my father is an officer in that same army, and I 
will not hear him reviled. Let me tell you that 
there is no regimental mess in our service where 
such a fellow as you would be tolerated; and if we 
are drawn into this war, you will very soon find 
out the difference between German theory and 
British practice. You will get such a lesson as you 
will never forget.’ 
Dous sprang to his feet and half-drew his sword. 
‘English pig!’ he cried; ‘in insulting me, you 
insult the whole German Army. I'll have satis- 
faction ;’ and he drew his sword completely from 
the scabbard. 
‘Pooh, sir!’ replied Oliver coolly; ‘sit down, 
and don’t make a donkey of yourself. I am no 
German schoolboy to be frightened by your bluster. 
Your Zabern affair* made your army ridiculous 
enough in the eyes of Europe; don’t add another 
page to it in Frankfort.’ 
For answer Dous knocked over glasses, table and 
all, and made a cut at the English lad’s head; but 
Oliver was on the alert, and stepping hastily on one 
side as the Uhlan lurched forward, he caught him

a stunning blow just under the left ear, that sent 
his square-topped cap flying off his head to the full 
length of the lines which secured it to his body, 
and laid Lieutenant Otto Dous of the Garde Uhlan 
Regiment on his back among the broken glass 
and spilled wine on the velvety turf of the Palm 
Garden.
-P-A-G-E-17
  CHAPTER II. 
DENOUNCED AS A SPY. 
5 whole incident took barely a minute from 
the time when Dous made his sneering remark 
till he was laid on his back; hence none of those 
around guessed that the four people sitting 
at the little table had any subject of disagree- 
ment among them. When, however, they saw an 
officer knocked down, an angry crowd of both men 
and women gathered round, and ‘English pig!” 
‘Insolent dog!’ were some of the muttered epithets 
as Lieutenant Dous scrambled to his feet, his face 
livid with rage. He had retained his grip on his 
sword, and was apparently intent on plunging it 
into Oliver. Against this weapon the lad had only 
his walking-stick, but gripping this firmly, with 
flashing eyes and fearless mien he faced the German. 
How the fray would have ended is doubtful, had 
not Von Lenz, recovering from a momentary sur- 
prise, caused by the very idea of any one daring 
to raise his hand against a German officer, stepped 
in between the angry pair. 
‘For shame, Dous!’ he cried. ‘Put up your 
sword. Remember Hastings is a foreigner, and does 
not understand our ways.’ 
‘Stand aside!’ snapped Dous, trying to dodge by 
Von Lenz. 
But the Hussar was as quick as he, and laying 
his hand on his own sword, with a significant look 
he said, ‘This can be settled somewhere else.’
-P-A-G-E-18
  10 DENOUNCED AS A SPY. 
‘He shall give me satisfaction,’ persisted Dous. 
‘When and how you like,’ cried Oliver; ‘now, if 
one of you will lend me a sword.’ 
The crowd, ever eager for unhealthy excitement, 
applauded the idea of a fight with swords, but Von 
Lenz, who of the four was by far the coolest at the 
moment, took Oliver by the arm. 
‘Come,’ said he, ‘let’s get out of this while we 
can; you have committed a grave crime in striking 
a German officer.’ 
He drew Oliver away for a few steps; but the 
crowd was not disposed to let him off so easily. 
‘Whip the insolent English wretch!’ shrilled one 
very stout woman; and several young men of the 
German dandy class, wearing very high collars and 
Homburg hats with large feathers stuck in the back 
of the band, attempted to jostle Oliver; but the 
lad squared his shoulders, and raising his cane, 
cried, ‘Stand aside, you empty-heads, or you’ll get 
hurt!’ On this one pale-faced, bulbous-eyed youth 
started back so suddenly that he stamped on the 
toe of an officer just behind him, who, uttering a 
ery of rage, kicked the unhappy youth so lustily on 
the shin that he fell back with a ery of pain, 
knocking over another valiant Frankforter. 
While the military element glared angrily at this 
new offender, Von Lenz drew Oliver away, though 
the latter protested all the time. 
‘Don’t be foolish, Oliver,’ said the young Hussar. 
‘You know enough of Germany to understand that 
you’ve committed an offence heavily punishable at 
any time; and now this war fever’s on, goodness 
knows what might happen.’ 
Oliver, having plenty of common-senr>, resisted
-P-A-G-E-19
DENOUNCED AS A SPY. 11 
no longer. Mixing with the crowd round the band- 
stand, they passed through it, and entered a leafy 
avenue, unlit by fairy lamps. 
‘Now you had better hurry back to your hotel 
and lie quiet for a bit,’ said Von Lenz. ‘In a day 
or two we shall all be gone, and then you can 
please yourself. I am sorry you have made an 
enemy of Dous, who is a dangerous man; but in 
any case I will give you a call, if I can, before I go. 
Now hurry, my friend, while I return to try to 
smooth things over.’ 
Realising that Von Lenz was right, Oliver gripped 
his hand heartily, and leaving the Palm Garden, 
turned his steps along Miguel Strasse into the 
Bockenheimer Landstrasse and on to the Schiller 
Platz, where, at the Pariser Hof, he was staying. 
He bore some signs in his attire of the scuffle he 
had passed through, and the obsequious porter gave 
him a keen look, though he muttered only ‘ Guten 
Abend’ as Oliver passed. Reaching his room, which 
was on the second floor, the lad dropped into a 
chair to think over the situation. It did not take 
him long to come to the conclusion that it would 
be best for him to clear out of Germany without 
delay. The war fever had seized on the whole 
nation, apparently, and though Britain might 
possibly take no part in the war, yet foreigners 
were not looked upon with much favour. Should 
Britain be drawn in—and who could tell ?—it might 
be impossible to get out of the country. So Oliver, 
always a lad of action, began his packing, a task 
which did not take him long, for he ‘travelled 
light. This having been done, his next care was 
for a wash and supper; then to bed, for he intended
-P-A-G-E-20
12 DENOUNCED AS A SPY. 
to start by the early morning train. He was 
leaving his room for the restaurant of the hotel, 
when Carl, his own particular waiter, who had 
attended to his wants during the week he had been 
at the Pariser -Hof, and who, owing to the liberal 
tips he had received from the ‘ Herr Englander,’ had 
always been exceedingly civil, came stepping along 
the passage with a cautious tread and a scared look. 
Seeing Oliver, he pressed a note into his hand; 
then, putting two fat fingers to his lips as though 
to enjoin secrecy, he whispered, ‘Read it at once, 
Herr Hastings; and do not say I gave it to you.’ 
Wondering what could be the matter, Oliver went 
back to his room, and opening the envelope, took 
therefrom a half-sheet of note-paper. 
‘DEAR OLIVER,’ it ran, ‘Lieutenant Dous has de- 
nounced you as a spy, and you will be arrested at 
once. Leave Frankfort without a moment’s delay, 
but not by rail, as the stations are guarded. As 
you love me, burn this directly you have read it, 
and never betray the fact that I warned you. 
Trust no one.—Yours, Lupwie von LEnz.’ 
Oliver read this letter twice before the full import 
of the words struck him; then he gave a low 
whistle, and, striking a match, lit the paper and 
watched it slowly burn. He knew that he was in 
great danger. Germans had a quick method of 
dealing with spies at any time, and just then— 
Oliver’s brows contracted as he remembered the talk 
of the morning. A young Frenchman living in 
Frankfort had fallen under suspicion; he had been 
arrested and taken to the barracks. An informal 
examination had been held, and there were persistent
-P-A-G-E-21
DENOUNCED AS A SPY. 13 
rumours that within an hour he had been shot. 
What had been the Frenchman’s fate might easily 
be his. ‘Trust no one, Von Lenz had said. What 
could that mean? There was no time for thought ; 
the best thing to do was to clear out at once. 
Taking a hundred-mark note from his pocket, he 
laid it on the table to settle his reckoning, scribbling a 
few lines to go with it; then, thrusting a few things 
from his bag into his pocket, he was about to leave 
the hotel quietly, when the military tramp, tramp of 
feet sounded in the street just outside his window. 
Looking out, he saw a file of infantry under a 
sergeant, and with them Moritz Falkenberg. He 
rubbed his eyes as if to make sure. No, there was 
no mistaking the tall form of Falkenberg, his uni- 
form alone distinguishing him. He said a few words 
to the sergeant, who, leaving several of his men 
outside, entered the hotel with the rest. For a 
moment Oliver thought there could be no danger of 
arrest so long as Falkenberg was with the soldiers. 
Then Von Lenz’s words recurred to him, ‘Trust no 
one.” That must have been intended as a warning. 
Good. It should not be lost on him. 
Quick as thought he locked his door. His retreat 
that way was cut off in any case, for the soldiers 
were already mounting the only stairs that led from 
the ground-floor. He looked down into the street. 
There was Falkenberg, smoking a cigarette, stand- 
ing full in the glare of the electric lights in the 
entrance, 
It seemed to Oliver as if he was fairly trapped ; 
but suddenly a chance of escape occurred to him. 
Just inside the door was a recess, fitted with pegs 
and used as a hanging cupboard; in front hung a 
  
elt ol
-P-A-G-E-22
14 DENOUNCED AS A SPY, 
curtain. Switching off the electric light, Oliver hid 
behind the curtain in the recess. Hardly had he 
done so, when some one tried the door. Finding it 
locked, that some one shook it roughly, then cried 
out in a loud voice, ‘Open at once, in the name of 
the Kaiser !” 
/Again getting no answer, the same voice said, 
‘Stand aside, Mtiller; and you, Leithold. When I 
break open the door, rush in and seize the English-. 
man. If he resists, shoot him!’ 
There was a moment’s silence, during which Oliver 
felt his heart thumping with excitement. Then 
came the sound of some one hurling himself across 
the passage, and of a crash, presumably from a 
heavy boot. The screws which held the fastening 
of the lock were torn from the wood, and the door 
flew open. 
In rushed the two privates, followed by a burly 
sergeant; but, coming from the lighted passage into 
the dark room, one of them tripped over a chair, 
the second fell over him, and the sergeant colliding 
with the two, a volley of guttural German oaths 
rolled out. 
In an instant Oliver darted from his hiding-place 
and along the passage. A young waiter, mouth 
agape, eyes starting from his head, stood in Oliver’s 
way. A fierce thrust in the chest sent him stagger- 
ing, with a-wild yell of fear, into a bedroom. 
Speeding down the passage, Oliver reached the bath- 
room. In one instant he had locked and bolted the 
door; next he had climbed through the small win- 
dow on to a lead flat; crossing this, he shinned 
down a rain-water pipe, and found himself in the 
yard at the rear of the hotel. Meanwhile a terrific 
  Gj 
 
-P-A-G-E-23

hubbub was heard behind him, and from a window 
above the head of a soldier appeared. A moment 
later there was a flash, a loud report, and a bullet 
went—somewhere. Oliver knew the lie of the 
ground, and running across the yard, gained the 
gate, and was out in the small court which ran 
beside the hotel. At top speed he raced away just 
as a couple of soldiers took up the chase. Oliver 
‘knew he had little to fear from the heavily booted 
soldiers, but as he came into the Liebfrauen Strasse 
some civilians joined in, and one or two tried to 
stop him. Setting his teeth, Oliver struck out right 
and left. A stout officer, seeing a lad running and 
a crowd after him, called out in pompous tones for 
him to stop, at the same time seizing the hilt of 
his sword to draw it. The knot, however, had got 
tangled up, and before he knew what was happening 
he received Oliver’s head plump in the centre of his 
sword-belt, when, with a horrible gasping cry, he 
sat down in a hurried fashion on the pavement, his 
eyes almost starting from his head, his mouth open 
and gaping like a fish out of water. 
Diving into some side-streets, Oliver reached the 
old town, and in ten minutes was on the river- 
bank. Keeping well in the shadow of the tall old 
houses, he was making for the bridge, when the 
clatter of hoofs caught his ear and a squadron of 
cavalry came across at a trot. Oliver hid in the 
shadow till the soldiers had gone, and was again 
making for the bridge, when he spied a small boat. 
Here was the very means of crossing that he re- 
quired, and in a few minutes he was in mid-stream, 
when, to his horror, he heard the sound of shouting, 
and several soldiers, evidently still in pursuit of him,
-P-A-G-E-24
  16 DENOUNCED AS A SPY. 
ran on to the bridge. Oliver was then close to the 
long, sedge-covered island which stands in the middle 
of the river just clear of the bridge, and he drove 
his boat in amongst the sedges, where by lying down 
he could not be seen from the bridge or the bank. 
He had not been there long before two soldiers who 
had run across the bridge came walking back, just 
as an officer approached from the northern end. 
They met near the figure of Charlemagne in the 
centre, just above where Oliver was hiding, and he 
could both see and hear all that passed. 
The officer was Falkenberg, and one of the soldiers 
was the sergeant. 
‘I cannot see anything of him, Herr Lieutenant,’ 
said the latter, saluting. ‘I do not think he crossed 
the bridge; there are troops on the other side, who 
would certainly have seen him. What shall we 
do ?’ 
‘As you please,’ remarked Falkenberg, shrugging 
his shoulders. ‘I am not responsible for this “dan- 
gerous spy ;”’ and there was a sarcastic ring in his 
voice as he spoke. ‘My duty was to show you 
where he lived. Now you’d better get back and 
report to Lieutenant Dous; he will doubtless give 
you a hearty welcome.’ 
With these words he lit a cigarette and crossed 
the bridge, while the sergeant and the soldier stood 
for a moment stock-still. Then, raising his fist, the 
sergeant struck the soldier heavily on the face. 
‘It’s your fault, you clumsy pig!’ he growled; 
‘if you hadn’t missed when you fired, all would have 
been well. Whatever the Herr Lieutenant does to 
me I'll pass on to you with interest. And now, 
march, you dog!’ And the two sullenly departed. R
-P-A-G-E-25

Waiting till all was quiet, Oliver came from his 
hiding-place, and quietly paddled across to the south 
shore. Landing, he walked along the bank in the 
direction of the swimming-baths, when, coming along 
the quay, he saw the head of a company of soldiers. 
Muttering to himself that the troops were every- 
where, and fearing that, dishevelled and hatless as 
he was, he would be sure to be stopped and ques- 
tioned, Oliver retraced his steps, and was running 
quickly and silently along under the shadow of the 
high warehouses, when, turning a corner suddenly, 
he ran full tilt into a man. He was apologising in 
English, so surprised was he, when, chancing to 
look up, he gave an exclamation of surprise. 
‘Vivian Drummond !’ he gasped. 
The young man so addressed seized the youth by 
the arm and gazed fiercely into his face; then, re- 
cognising him, he laughed softly. 
‘Young Noll, my old fag! Well, wonders will 
never cease! Come with me, young man; you and 
I must have a chat.’

  CHAPTER IIlL 
OLIVER MEETS WITH A MiSHAP. 
LIVER’S surprise at meeting Vivian Drummond 
was so great that, without a word, he accom- 
panied his old schoolfellow. They walked rapidly 
along the quay, keeping well in the shadow of the 
buildings. There were few people about, and these, 
mostly of the lower order, took no notice of the two 
English lads. In silence they reached the suburb 
of Sachsenhausen, and there, on a public seat in a 
street that was quite deserted, the two sat down. 
‘Now, young Noll,’ said the elder, ‘how comes it 
that I find you in Frankfort, hatless, a little 
crumpled, and decidedly in a funk, running along in 
the shadows as if somebody you were not anxious 
to see were after you ?’ 
‘I might retaliate by asking what you are doing 
in Frankfort, when, the last time we met, you were 
in Berlin, engaged in business.’ 
‘To which I should reply that you were rude, 
and probably give you one of my seventy-seven 
reasons. One reason is, business brought me here ; 
the other seventy-six don’t matter. Now, Oliver, 
the truth.’ 
Vivian Drummond had a masterful way with him 
that commanded obedience, and Oliver had not quite 
got over the fag’s awe of his elder. Without further 
parley, then, he said, ‘ Well, as I told you when I 
met you in Berlin a year ago, I left Heidelberg
-P-A-G-E-27
mn by i be 
  OLIVER MEETS WITH A MISHAP. 19 
for England to study for the Civil Service. After 
a year’s grind a holiday was welcome, and I 
got the dad to let me run over here for a week or 
two to hunt up some of my old Heidelberg chums. 
The outbreak of war has interfered with my plans a 
bit, and I was passing a farewell evening with a 
couple of friends in the Palm Garden, when an officer, 
who was also of the party, made some slighting 
remark about the British army, and I knocked him 
down.’ 
‘Good man.!’ said Vivian; ‘quite English, but 
very foolish. And after that ?’ 
Oliver related exactly what had happened ; at the 
conclusion of which Vivian whistled. 
‘By Jove, youngster!’ he said, ‘you’ve had a 
jolly narrow squeak. I know this Dous man pretty 
well. He is one of the most unscrupulous members 
of a very unscrupulous gang. Had you fallen into his 
‘hands you’d never have seen Old England again. 
Also, had you stayed another day or two in Frank- 
fort you ’d have stood a good chance of a long resi- 
dence there, and under not very pleasant conditions 
either.’ 
‘What do you mean ?’ 
‘Just what I say; you’d have been a prisoner 
of war.’ 
“But Germany is not at war with Britain.’ 
‘My good youth, Germany has been at war with 
Britain for the past five years. It doesn’t suit her 
to declare it yet; but, with my help, Britain will 
show her hand within the next forty-eight hours, 
and meanwhile you and I had better get clear of the 
Fatherland.’ 
‘I don’t understand a bit what you mean,’
-P-A-G-E-28
  20 OLIVER MEETS WITH A MISHAP, 
‘Of course you don’t. In due course—a splendid 
War Office phrase—I shall inform you. Now are 
you tired ?’ 
‘No; as fresh as paint.’ 
‘That’s good, because we’ve got a long walk 
before us.’ 
‘Where to ?’ 
‘Mainz.’ 
‘Why, that’s twenty miles,’ said Oliver, aghast. 
‘Twenty-three and a bit, to be exact.’ 
‘Why not take the train ?’ 
‘Because, first of all, the railways in Germany are 
now in the hands of the military, and no foreigner 
can go anywhere without a passport, which of course 
you haven’t got. Secondly, German organisation is 
perfect, and by this time the railway officers, for a 
radius of ten miles, will be on the lookout for you. 
Thirdly, I am not particularly anxious to be seen; 
and, lastly, while you are with me, I am in com- 
mand, and you must unhesitatingly obey orders. 
Now, young Noll, brace yourself together, follow my 
lead in everything, ask no questions as you value 
your life, and don’t speak unless I speak to you 
first. To speak English is to betray ourselves at 
once, and to speak German means that if we’re 
overheard others may be as wise as we are; so 
mums the word, and the best foot forward.’ 
Without another word Vivian started off; and 
Oliver, more puzzled than ever, and, if the truth 
must be told, a little in awe of his masterful 
companion, stepped out briskly beside him. 
As they strode along they saw soldiers every- 
where, singly, in small parties, in companies, in 
regiments—always, always soldiers, mostly in a new
-P-A-G-E-29
  OLIVER MEETS WITH A MISHAP. 21 
greeny-gray service uniform, their head-dresses pro- 
vided with linen covers. 
Vivian Drummond did not appear to take par- 
ticular notice of the soldiers; but every now and 
then, when they were unobserved, Oliver noticed him 
jotting down a number or a letter on the cuff of his 
shirt. : 
In this way they went on till they reached the 
beautiful Stadtwald, the city forest, which Vivian 
knew as well, apparently, as he did the town. 
Travelling by the lesser-used footpaths, they were 
pushing on, when suddenly Vivian stopped. 
‘There are troops here,’ he whispered to Oliver. 
‘That hum and buzz there is no mistaking.’ 
Oliver could not hear anything at first; where- 
upon Vivian said, ‘Lie down and listen on the 
earth.’ 
Oliver then distinctly heard a sound which Vivian 
said was caused by the varied movements of numbers 
of men, 
‘You have pretty sharp ears,’ said Oliver. 
‘And want them, too. Now, young man, I am 
going to get close to those soldiers to find out a few 
things. Perhaps you’d better stay here until I 
return ; or, if I don’t return, get out of the country 
as fast as you can.’ 
*Can’t I come too ?’ 
‘It’s risky.’ 
‘T’m not afraid.’ 
‘Then do exactly as I tell you in all things. If 
the soldiers should discover us and haul us up before 
the officers, remember we are both Irishmen and 
don’t speak any more German than is necessary to 
ask for a railway ticket or a cigar.’
-P-A-G-E-30
  22 OLIVER MEETS WITH A MISHAP. 
‘Right.’ 
Walking now with the utmost caution, and keep- 
ing well under the shadow of the great trees, they 
went on till they got close up to the men. It was 
evidently a bivouac, but no fires were visible. 
Men were lying about, many sound asleep, as if 
tired out, their heads resting on their packs. In 
the moonlight, sentries were seen here and there, 
but they were performing their duties in a very 
perfunctory manner, as though the work was more 
ceremonious than necessary. 
Owing to the thickness of the woods, it was not 
difficult to avoid observation, and, without accident, 
they got nearly as far as the large restaurant in the 
centre of the forest, outside which several fires of 
wood had been lit, more probably for effect than for 
warmth, as the night was quite hot. 
Numbers of officers were sitting or lying about, 
mostly smoking, and it was clear this was where 
they meant to pass the night. a 
‘Don’t make a sound,’ whispered Vivian. ‘I 
must try to hear what these fellows are talking 
about. Drop down as I do, and crawl like a snake ; 
if we’re in danger of being discovered, lie down and 
pretend to be asleep.’ 
‘Right.’ 
Very silently the two English lads went forward, 
getting gradually nearer until the voices of the 
Germans could be distinctly heard. In this way 
they reached a wooden shed in which probably 
garden tools were kept, and here, lying down as 
though asleep, Vivian and Oliver waited, strain- 
ing their ears to catch the conversation of the 
officers,
-P-A-G-E-31
OLIVER MEETS WITH A MISHAP. 23 
In spite, however, of all their efforts they could 
only distinguish occasional words, and were just 
despairing of hearing anything of value, when two 
officers, both smoking, as though to stretch their 
legs came sauntering straight towards the wooden 
shed. They halted in its shadow, when one said in 
low tones, ‘What did you learn from Hermann, 
Max ?’ 
‘Simply that we are halted here till the morning, 
as the trains are too crowded to allow us to entrain 
to-night.’ 
‘And where are we going ?’ 
‘To the Russian frontier, together with the whole 
18th Army Corps.’ © 
‘Just what I said; and we shall get more knocks 
there than glory. I wish we had been going to 
the French frontier.’ 
‘We’re just as well off, Heinrich; the French 
will fight hard.’ 
‘Bah! it will be 1870 over again; in a month 
our troops will be in Paris. It may cost us a 
quarter of a million men, but what of that? We 
can spare them, and Paris is worth the price.’ 
‘I am not so sure, Heinrich, that it will be as 
you say.’ 
‘But I know it, Max. We are not going the 
way of 1870; we shall oceupy Luxemburg, and 
the Seventh, Ninth, and Tenth Armies will march 
through Belgium.’ 
‘Are you sure of that ?’ 
‘T had it from Von Emmich himself, and he told 
me all the staff knew it.’ 
‘But supposing the Belgians fight ?’ 
‘Supposing a lot of old women with broomsticks
-P-A-G-E-32
24 OLIVER MEETS WITH A MISHAP. 
fight! I tell you we should eat them up, march 
over them,’ 
‘What about Litge, Namur, and Antwerp? Hard 
nuts to crack, those.’ 
The officer addressed as Heinrich laughed sardoni- 
cally. ‘We have friends there as everywhere,’ said 
he. ‘Besides, Krupps have seen to that. Don’t 
forget they supplied the guns, or at least had 
the order for them. They have delayed delivery 
of the big ones, and the small ones were specially 
prepared with soft steel linings; after a couple of 
rounds they ’ll be useless. Liige and Namur are as 
good as ours. Antwerp, we know, is still unarmed, 
and will be ours when we choose to take it. The 
French are not ready, and, as I said before, we shall 
be in Paris in a month. Then we shall hurl all 
our strength on St Petersburg, and by Christmas 
the war will be over.’ 
‘The 18th Army Corps will have to bear the 
brunt of the fighting in holding the Russians in 
check till France is smashed; that is why I wish 
we were going to the French frontier. Suppose 
England were to join in ?’ 
‘Bah! she dare not move. We shall overawe 
her, and when we’ve settled France and Russia 
her turn will come. Austria can deal with Serbia, 
and Italy will hold southern France.’ 
‘It sounds all right, but Hush! Here 
comes Hermann. Not a word to him, mind,’ 
whispered Max; and just then a tall, thin man 
approached the two officers, and in a rather grating 
voice exclaimed, ‘Hallo! what are you two fellows 
plotting here ?’ 
‘We’re just making our final arrangements about  
-P-A-G-E-33
  OLIVER MEETS WITH A MISHAP. 25 
letting our people know in case one of us should be 
bowled over, colonel,’ answered Max with a laugh. 
‘Fie! don’t think of falling; think only of 
winning your majority and the Iron Cross,’ said 
Colonel Hermann. ‘The Kaiser hasn’t spent years 
over his plans for nothing; everything will work 
like clockwork; all is arranged, down to the 
minutest detail.’ 
‘Yes, colonel,’ said the other officer, ‘I think 
Germany will astonish the world in this war.’ 
The colonel laughed. ‘We are going to re- 
arrange the map of Europe,’ he said. ‘When we 
have done—well, the Fatherland will not be as it 
is now. But come, don’t mope about; join us in 
the restaurant. We are going to take a Schlaftrank 
[sleeping-cup].’ 
He turned to go. The two subordinates, ex- 
changing a quick glance as though wishing him 
somewhere else, turned and followed him. 
Waiting till they were out of earshot, Vivian 
whispered, ‘That’s a fair illustration of the good- 
fellowship which exists between German officers— 
the subordinates fearing and disliking their chief, 
ready to lie to him at a moment’s notice sooner 
than confide in him; he, distrusting his juniors, 
taking them off with him rather than leave them 
together, for fear they might be plotting something 
against him.’ 
Oliver made no reply; and they lay where they 
were for a little while, until Vivian said, ‘Now we 
must be off’ I’ve learnt the one thing I wanted 
to know. Europe will be in a blaze in a week; 
let ’s get out of this before we ’re singed.’ 
Proceeding with the same caution as before, they
-P-A-G-E-34
26 OLIVER MEETS WITH A MISHAP. 
threaded their way for some distance through the 
forest, until, having successfully passed the sentries, 
they strode off at a good pace, not exchanging 
another word. Presently they heard the buzzing 
sound of men in bivouac, and soon got near to yet 
another body of soldiers. 
‘Confound them!’ muttered Vivian; ‘we shall 
have to skirt this lot; they lie right across our 
road,’ 
They walked on for a considerable time, but the 
long line of soldiers extended farther still, and they 
presently came almost to the outskirts of the city 
forest. Two paths branched from the spot at which 
they had arrived. 
‘I’m not quite certain,’ said Vivian, ‘which of 
these paths we ought to take; though I thought I 
knew the wood pretty well, too. Jolly annoying.’ 
He thought for a moment, and then continued, ‘ You 
wait here, Oliver. Ill just go a little way along 
to see if I can recognise any landmark, It’s safer 
for one to go than two; and Ill return in ten 
minutes.’ 
He went off; and Oliver waited ten, fifteen, 
twenty minutes, but still his companion had not 
returned. ‘Very strange,’ he thought. ‘I suppose 
he can’t have been caught. But no; he’s too wide 
awake. I’Il just have a look round to see if I can 
discover anything of him.’ 
He came out on the road, and went cautiously 
along it for some way; but though this time he 
could see camp-fires in the distance, he saw nobody. 
He retraced his steps, and went a little way along 
the other path, when, stepping from the shadow 
of the trees into the moonlight, came a sentry. He
-P-A-G-E-35
  OLIVER MEETS WITH A MISHAP. 27 
gave one look at Oliver, hesitated a moment, and 
then demanded, ‘ Hallo! who are you, and what are 
you doing here prying about ?’ 
Remembering Vivian’s advice, Oliver shook his 
head and answered in English, ‘I don’t understand.’ 
‘Englisch—Englisch,’ replied the sentry, bringing 
down his rifle to the ready and fingering the trigger 
as though uncertain how to act. Apparently the 
problem was too difficult for him, for he laid a 
heavy hand on Oliver’s shoulder, and saying, 
‘Komm, led him under the shadow of the trees, 
where several men were lying asleep. 
Still holding Oliver, he awakened his sergeant, 
who, ceasing his snoring, sat up and most volubly 
cursed the sentry for waking him. Then, hearing 
his story, he yawned, turned angrily to Oliver, and 
in broken English asked, ‘You Engleesh ?’ 
‘Yes.’ 
‘Vhat you make here at dese times of nights ?’ 
‘I was taking a late stroll through the forest, 
and lost my way.’ 
‘Ach, so; vhat you mean s-troll? Walk, ‘eh, 
spaziergehen? Den vhy you not so zay? Hs ist 
argwohwisch—vhat you call suspicious. Where do 
you go?’ 
‘Frankfort,’ replied Oliver, mentioning the first 
place that occurred to him. 
‘Ach, so; also we go to Frankfort morgenfrih— 
quite early, dat is. Perhaps you shall mit us come.’ 
Then, speaking in German, he said to the sentry, 
‘Hofmann, bind this crack-brained English fool. 
He shall go before the captain ere we start in 
the morning. He may be aspy. Anyhow, look to 
it that he does not get away, or your hide will
-P-A-G-E-36
28 OLIVER MEETS WITH A MISHAP. 
suffer for it. If he attempts to escape, bayonet 
him.’ So saying, this amiable person turned over 
and settled himself to sleep again. 
The sentry undid the strap that secured the ends 
of the rolled greatcoat which he wore across his 
shoulders, and with this fastened Oliver’s wrists, 
plainly intimating that if his prisoner resisted he 
would be bayoneted. He then led him a little 
distance away to a spot close by the road where his 
‘walk’ was, and after fastening Oliver’s legs with 
a rifle-sling, laid him on the ground, and, with a 
grin, said, ‘Now, English pig, lie there till the 
morning, and sleep if you can. I'll see that Carl 
Hofmann’s hide doesn’t smart through you.’ 
Oliver pretended not to understand a word, and 
Private Hofmann resumed his walk for some ten 
minutes. Then, halting just at the edge of the 
wood from which he had stepped out on Oliver, he 
‘ordered’ his rifle and stood, apparently lost in 
thought, perhaps thinking of some Gretchen or 
Nannerl, or perhaps of his mother far away, and 
wondering if he would ever see her again. 
Oliver was busy wondering what had become of 
Vivian. In spite of himself, some little doubt of 
him would crop up in his mind; but when he 
remembered the open, frank, gallant Vivian of his 
Rugby days, he instantly dismissed the idea. It 
was all so strange, even the brutality the German 
soldiers had suddenly developed.
-P-A-G-E-37
  CHAPTER IV. 
OLIVER IS STILL MORE MYSTIFIED. 
LIVER, though feeling exceedingly uncomfort- 
able, must have dozed off; for a few minutes 
later he awoke with a start, to find the sentry once 
more pacing up and down. Presently the man 
again came to a standstill just in front of his 
prisoner, and ‘ordering’ his rifle, he stood looking 
down the road. Oliver gazed at him for a minute 
or two, but the German did not move; then, turning 
his eyes for a moment, the youth thought he saw 
a shadow move amongst the trees on his right, and 
a face peep out. It looked like Vivian, but the stern, 
set features were very different from Vivian’s usual 
nonchalant appearance. Seeing that he had been 
observed, as had doubtless been his intention, Vivian 
placed one finger on his lips in token of silence, 
and again disappeared. Wondering what would 
happen next, Oliver lay and waited ; then a crouch- 
ing figure crept from among the trees, just behind 
the sentry, and, with noiseless, stealthy steps, ap- 
proached him. 
Vivian’s look almost made Oliver shudder, and 
he noticed that his late companion carried something 
black and heavy in his right hand. Staring with 
all his might, he saw Vivian give a sudden bound 
forward and strike with the black object, catching 
the German full on the temple. The soldier 
staggered and half turned round, when a second 
blow fell with a thud upon his head. He then’ 
 
-P-A-G-E-38

completely collapsed, Vivian catching his rifle as 
it slipped from the man’s nerveless grasp. For a 
moment the Englishman stood over the German, 
gazing at him; then he darted to Oliver's side, and 
in twenty seconds had freed him from his bonds. 
‘Quick,’ he whispered; ‘not a moment to lose. 
Pop this in your pocket;’ and he handed Oliver 
the ‘black object, which proved to be a sock half- 
filled with sand. ‘A capital tool at a pinch,’ said 
Vivian. 
Stepping over to the German, with an adroitness 
that almost made Oliver shudder, so easily did he 
perform his task, Vivian removed the soldier’s 
helmet, pack, rolled greatcoat, belts, and boots. 
‘Now shove your handkerchief into his mouth 
and strap up his wrists and ankles, said Vivian 
sharply. 
Oliver did as he was bidden, and by the time he 
had finished Vivian had slipped on the German’s 
top-boots over his own and donned the greatcoat and 
accoutrements. The helmet was a bit too big, but 
with deft fingers Vivian folded his handkerchief and 
slipped it under the leather band inside, which made 
ib fit quite well. 
‘Help me to carry this chap under the trees,’ he 
said; and in another minute this was done. ‘Hell 
be all right in a quarter of an hour, Meanwhile we 
must be off. Now away with you. Remember you 
are my prisoner, and speak no German. March just 
beside me.’ Picking up the rifle, he set out, and 
Oliver keeping close to him, away they went. 
They marched for some distance along the path 
down which Vivian had disappeared when first he 
had left Oliver, and though they passed close to
-P-A-G-E-39
OLIVER IS STILL MORE MYSTIFIED. 31 
several soldiers, none of them took any notice of 
Vivian or his prisoner. 
About a mile from the place where Oliver had 
been captured Vivian halted. ‘Remember now, you 
speak no German; but keep your eyes and ears 
open for what happens. I am going to borrow a 
motor-car; but if the sentry offers any opposition 
or twigs anything is wrong, I shall have to attack 
him, and shall leave you to chip in and help as 
occasion may offer. I shall strap your hands, but 
in such a way that you can instantly free them if 
necessary.’ 
‘Right you are,’ replied Oliver; and, their pre- 
parations finished, the two approached a spot where 
several motor-cars and bicycles were parked. <A 
soldier stood guard over them, and him Vivian 
boldly passed, helping Oliver up into a small, light 
car. 
‘Hallo!’ said the sentry, approaching ; ‘what are 
you doing ?’ 
‘The colonel is going into Frankfort at once with 
this youth whom we have found, and who, he 
thinks, can give important information.’ 
‘What is he—a spy, eh ?’ 
Vivian put on a knowing look. ‘That we shall 
leave the colonel to find out; but don’t keep him 
waiting, for you know how impatient he is.’ 
‘Ja wohl, muttered the sentry; then suddenly, 
‘But you haven’t got the colonel’s car. That belongs 
to Captain Eckhardt.’ 
‘I know that. Captain Eckhardt is going to 
drive us into Frankfort. It’s said there is a lady 
he is very anxious to see before we start for Russia ; 
for who shall say how many will come back ?’ 
 
-P-A-G-E-40
  82 OLIVER IS STILL MORE MYSTIFIED. 
‘True, comrade,’ sighed the sentry. 
All this while Vivian had been busy with the 
car, and just at that moment he gave the starting- 
handle a deft turn, started the engine, jumped up 
beside Oliver, and in twenty seconds was gliding 
smoothly along the road, the sentry gazing after 
them with a slightly puzzled look. 
‘Poor Hans!’ said Vivian; ‘I’ve completely 
bluffed him. His instructions didn’t say exactly in 
so many words what he ought to do under these 
circumstances ; and though I am sure he was a little 
suspicious, he was frightened to death to think of 
going against the order of his superior officer. 
Initiative is, happily for us, unknown in the 
German army; but our friend will learn something 
when it’s found out in the morning that he witnessed 
our departure so placidly;’ and Vivian chuckled 
softly. 
Once clear of the city forest, Vivian slipped 
his gears in, and, as he expressed it, ‘let her go.’ 
They passed some cavalry and four or five batteries 
on the road, but Vivian’s German uniform seemed 
sufficient passport, and though some of the officers 
glanced curiously at the car, none questioned. So, 
without further adventure, they arrived at Castel. 
‘Now, young man,’ said Vivian, ‘the other side 
the bridge is Mainz, where for the time being I am 
stopping, Walk across, and wait for me at the 
bridge-head.’ 
. Oliver started off, admiring the fine view of the 
broad Rhine, looking silvery in the moonlight. 
When he was alone, Vivian drove up to the 
garage kept by Jakob Voigt, knocked him up, and 
in true Prussian military fashion told him to take

charge of the car, and to hold it ready for the use 
of the army at a moment’s notice. Voigt, himself 
an old soldier, obeyed without a word. 
Vivian’s next step was to creep down to the 
river, divest himself of his greatcoat, helmet, boots, 
and accoutrements, tie them in a bundle round the 
rifle, and fling them far out into the river, where 
they sank. He then rejoined Oliver, in answer to 
whose questions he replied that he had ‘sunk’ his 
German war-paint. Leading the way to a house 
in the Rhein Promenade, he let himself in with 
a latchkey, and they ascended to three rooms 
on the second floor, two of which overlooked the 
river. 
The rooms were comfortably furnished, but there 
was nothing to show what were the tastes of the 
occupant. Oliver was bursting with questions, but 
Vivian held up his hand. 
‘This is no time for talking,’ he said; ‘speak 
but little, and that quietly. My servant is asleep 
in the next room, and he both sleeps lightly and 
listens attentively. Let us eat, drink, and sleep; 
for to-morrow * and he paused. 
‘Well, to-morrow ?’ 
‘We shall see,’ smiled Vivian. 
When at last Oliver did get to sleep, he slept 
soundly, to be awakened by Vivian, fresh and 
smiling, in a rose-coloured dressing-gown, shaking 
his shoulder and saying it was time to get up. 
It was a glorious morning, and through the wide- 
opened windows the cool air from the river was 
wafted in. 
Oliver’s wardrobe was supplemented by some of 
Vivian’s, which, though fitting in a fashion which

a Bond Street tailor would have described as 
‘atrocious,’ would, as Vivian said, ‘pass muster.’ 
Entering the small sitting-room, Oliver found 
there a youngish man, dark, with greeny-gray eyes, 
moving about with silent steps, finishing laying 
breakfast, 
‘Good-morning, Léffel,’ said Vivian to his servant. 
‘You see I have brought home a friend I met in 
Wiesbaden. He speaks no German, but that will 
give you an opportunity to practise your English.’ 
‘It will me delight, Herr Drummond,’ said Léffel 
in a low voice.—‘ Sir, I have pleasure to wish you 
good-morning ;’ and he bowed to Oliver. 
‘Good-morning,’ replied Oliver. 
‘And how, your honourable friend, shall he be 
called ?’ 
‘Oh, Wilson his name is.’ 
‘Oh yes, it is very English. Desire you that 
the breakfast served shall be ?’ 
«At once, Loffel.’ 
The man disappeared, and Vivian gave Oliver a 
wink. ‘You know your part, he whispered. ‘Be 
careful.’ Then louder, ‘This is the one English 
habit I stick to. I do like a decent breakfast to 
start the day.’ 
And a decent breakfast they made, attended on 
perfectly by Master Léoffel, who was somewhat 
amusing with his solemn manner and quaint 
English. 
“By the way, Wilson,’ said Vivian at the end of 
the’meal, ‘we ought to let your dad know we are 
returning. I’ll wire him, shall I?’ 
Without in the least understanding, Oliver an- 
swered, ‘Yes, I wish you would.’  
-P-A-G-E-45
OLIVER IS STILL MORE MYSTIFIED. 35 
‘Bring me a telegram-form, Léffel,’ said Vivian ; 
and writing his message, he handed it to Oliver, 
asking, ‘How will that do ?’ 
Oliver read: ‘ Wilson, 10 Regent’s Park Gardens, 
London. Henry no better. Temperature still high. 
Am returning with him.—Drummonp.’ 
‘That will be all right,’ he said. 
‘Good, then,’ said Vivian.—‘ Loffel, get this tele- 
gram away, will you?’ , 
‘In this minute, Herr Drummond ;’ and away 
went the obsequious servant. 
‘What on earth does all this mean?’ asked 
Oliver when they were alone. ‘Why all this secrecy, 
and what is the business you’re engaged upon ? 
I think I ought to know.’ 
‘Ssh, man! I will tell you by-and-by. The fate 
of thousands—ay, tens of thousands of lives, perhaps, 
depends upon that wire getting through.’ 
Oliver stared in open-eyed astonishment at his 
companion, half-doubting his sanity, as the night 
before he had doubted his loyalty. But Vivian’s 
face portrayed his anxiety, and he was clearly on 
thorns till Loffel returned. 
‘Got it off?’ he asked carelessly. 
«All right, Herr Drummond.’ 
‘Good. I thought they might object to the 
English,’ 
Loffel shrugged his shoulders. ‘Why should 
they ? It is not French.’ 
‘No. And now, Loffel, that reminds me. In 
consequence of this war, Germany is no place tor 
foreigners. I leave to-day until the war is over.’ 
Loffel hung his head to hide the sudden flash 
which came into his eyes. °
-P-A-G-E-46
  36 OLIVER IS STILL MORE MYSTIFIED. 
‘You go to England, I presume?’ he said, 
speaking in German. 
‘Possibly so, but not direct. I shall perhaps 
return. In any case, keep in touch with Berlin, so 
that I can always find you. I shall pay up your 
salary for a month ahead.’ 
‘You were always most considerate.’ 
‘And I want you to drive a car over to Frankfort 
for me. On your return I shall have everything 
ready. I shall travel down the Rhine by boat. 
Now get ready for Frankfort, will you ?’ 
In a quarter of an hour Léffel was ready. 
‘You know old Voigt’s garage at Castel ?” 
‘Quite well.’ 
‘Take this letter to him, and say you have come 
for Captain Eckhardt’s car. Drive over to Frankfort, 
where you will find the 182nd Regiment. Ask for 
Captain Eckhardt, and give him this letter. Return 
here with his reply.’ 
‘Very good, sir.’ 
Léffel departed; and Vivian, from behind the 
curtains, watched him go down the street. 
‘Now, young Noll, we must get to work,’ he said. 
‘First let us change our clothes.’ 
Amongst his wardrobe he found a striped blue 
flannel suit, which, with a little bracing up, Oliver 
could manage to wear. A Homburg hat and brown 
boots completed his get-up. Vivian himself put on 
a very loud German touring suit. That done, he 
ran hastily over the contents of a couple of boxes 
and packed a bag. 
‘The rest must be left,’ he muttered to himself. 
Frequently. glancing at his watch, he presently said, 
‘Oliver, we must be off. Put on your most non-

chalant manner and appear quite at ease. Remember, 
we are now a couple of Germans from Kénigsberg, 
come up the Rhine for a holiday.’ 
‘T understand.’ 
Vivian took his bag, and, chattering German 
volubly, they went up to the Post-Office. 
‘I want to use the telephone,’ said Vivian, and 
entering a public box, he rang up Voigt. ‘Hallo! 
are you there? Herr Voigt? Lieutenant Rentsch 
speaking, Has my servant started off with Captain 
Eckhardt’s car yet? He has. H’m—what a 
nuisance! I wanted to give him a message. Never 
mind ; it can’t be helped. Good-bye ;’ and he hung 
up the receiver. With smiling face he rejoined 
Oliver. ‘Now we’re off,’ he said. 
He stayed for a moment at a barber’s and made 
a purchase ; then bought some ham, fancy rolls, and 
fruit. Going down to the river, he got a boatman 
to pull them both out to a little electric cutter 
which lay twenty yards from tlf€‘shore, and, board- 
ing it, they deposited their parcels. Dismissing the 
boatman, Vivian set to work, and in five minutes 
they were going down-stream at a good pace. 
‘Thank goodness, all’s well so far!’ said Vivian. 
‘You forget I’m absolutely in the dark about all 
this,’ replied Oliver. 
They soon left Mainz behind them; then taking 
an envelope from his pocket, Vivian deftly adjusted 
a false moustache under Oliver’s nose and a similar 
one under his own. 
‘Now,’ he said, ‘let’s have a chat. For the first 
time we are sure we cannot be overheard by spies 
and can talk freely. I know you’re dying to ask 
questions ; so fire away.’
-P-A-G-E-48
  CHAPTER V. 
VIVIAN EXPLAINS, 
LIVER was indeed dying to ask questions. 
‘The fact is,’ he said, ‘ever since I met you 
my brain has been in a whirl. The whole thing is 
a mystery to me, and you yourself not the least 
part of it. When, by accident, I met you in Berlin, 
you were apparently a flourishing business man. 
How you came to be in Frankfort, deeply versed in 
German affairs; how you managed to come so 
opportunely to my rescue last night; who Loffel 
is; what’ 
‘My good Oliver, listen unto mine tale, and it 
will save you a lot of questions. When you saw 
me in Berlin I was apparently running a business 
there, a German branch of an English house. It 
was a high-class business, and brought me into 
contact with many people in good positions, to 
whom, for reasons of my own, I was always most 
attentive. The fact is, my dear boy, the business 
was a blind. I have the honour to hold his 
Britannic Majesty's commission. I am a lieutenant 
in the Coldstream Guards, and I am here in Germany 
to keep my eyes and ears open to learh anything 
that may be of use to my native land. It is a 
service not devoid of interest and excitement, and 
appeals to me infinitely more than does commanding 
a guard at Buckingham Palace or doing a tour of 
duty at the Bank of England. Besides, I had a  
-P-A-G-E-49
VIVIAN EXPLAINS. 39 
special knowledge of Germans and Germany, ,and 
thought I might’be able to be of use.’ ’ 
‘You ’re a spy, then ?’ 
Vivian shrugged his shoulders. ‘Old-fashioned 
people, I believe, did use that expression; now we 
are called 8.S.A.’s.’ 
‘And that means ?’ 
‘Special Service Agents.’ 
‘H’m—is this work necessary ?’ 
‘Necessary!’ said Vivian with more warmth 
than he usually displayed; ‘it is absolutely indis- 
pensable. Why, do you know that for every man 
Britain has over here, Germany possesses a hundred, 
perhaps five hundred, in Great Britain. For years 
this country has been preparing for the greatest 
war of all time; a war that, if successful, will retard 
civilisation, and will put Europe under the jack-boot 
of Prussian militarism, a tyranny as bad as that of 
the Middle Ages. Do you know that ?’ 
‘Good Lord! no. How should I?’ 
“Of course you don’t; nor would any one dream 
of such a great plot were it not for Special Service 
men, who, for the sake of worming their secrets out 
of foreign Governments, risk their liberty and take 
their lives in their hands; for I can assure you men 
disappear every now and then, and no questions can 
be asked. It is a more dangerous task than service 
in the field, and if successful there can be no reward, 
for everything must be secret; and if you fail and 
are found out, you must die without the hope of 
being avenged, for your country cannot own you.’ 
Oliver whistled. ‘By Jove!’ he said, ‘I never 
thought of the matter like that.’ 
‘No, I suppose not.’ 
   
-P-A-G-E-50
40 VIVIAN EXPLAINS. 
‘But what do you mean about Germany’s great 
plot? What is it ?’ 
‘Simply to conquer Europe, if not the world. 
Smash France, then Russia. Those countries con- 
quered, to crush Britain, and the rest of Europe is 
at Germany’s feet.’ 
‘Good heavens! Germany would never go for 
Great Britain; the Kaiser is half an Englishman 
himself.’ 
‘So much the more dangerous, said Vivian 
solemnly, ‘I tell you the Kaiser has been so belauded, 
is so vainglorious and so ambitious, that he thinks 
nothing can stop his victorious career once he draws 
the sword. But he is by nature cautious, or, rather, 
cunning, and being a man of some parts, realises the 
herculean task of smashing Great’ Britain. The 
Crown Prince, however, with none of his father’s 
shrewdness, but all his father’s vanity, is a dangerous 
lunatic. The head of a mad-brained, bumptious 
military aristocracy, he has forced on this war, and 
the Kaiser must stand by him.’ 
‘Do you think we shall be involved ?’ 
‘Most emphatically I do, and hope so too. If we 
don’t stand by France, nothing can save her; that 
I am sure of. France disposed of, Russia is only 
a question of time. Then dear Germany turns all 
her attention to us, her most hated foe, and the one 
she really fears. If we don’t stand in now, we shall 
have to square accounts alone with a Germany 
flushed with victory.’ 
‘By Jove! you make my blood run cold. I 
should never have thought Germany was so 
treacherous,’ 
‘The world will learn a good many things about
-P-A-G-E-51
VIVIAN EXPLAINS, 41 
Germany before it is very much older. It will 
learn that her Ministers have no conception of moral 
rectitude, that her commanders are not tied down 
by any of the rules of civilised warfare, and that 
her soldiers are simply barbarians. They have been 
trained in these ideas for twenty-five years, and now 
we shall see the fruit.’ 
‘But we sha’n’t declare war—shall we ?—and, 
from what Dous said, Germany has no intention of 
declaring war on us.’ 
‘That’s just the point. Germany reckons other 
countries by her own low estimate of morality. 
She will trample on small nations, ignore treaties, 
break promises, all to serve her own ends; and she 
thinks that other countries will allow these things 
to be done. You overheard that Germany means- 
to march her army through Belgium. The telegram 
Loffel sent off informed our Foreign Office of this 
fact. Directly: our Government learns this they 
will know they must step in, and will at once begin 
their preparations. Whether Germany meant crossing 
Belgium was the one thing I wanted to find out for 
certain ; that done, my work was over. We go now 
to Belgium to warn her. If*Belgium will only step 
into the breach till Britain and France are ready, 
Europe may be saved. But I tell you, Oliver, it is 
faced with a danger to which that from Louis XIV. 
or Napoleon was mere child’s-play. Germany is 
out to conquer Europe, and she will leave no means 
untried to do it.’ 
Oliver wiped the perspiration’ from his brow, and 
looked pale and uneasy. ‘It all seems a nightmare,’ 
he muttered. 
“It will be an Inferno before it is finished, and I  
-P-A-G-E-52
  42 VIVIAN EXPLAINS. 
don’t suppose you or I will see the end of it. It’s 
Armageddon, and the people who will see the end 
and reap the glory are not those who will see the 
beginning.’ 
‘But how did you manage to find out all this ?’ 
‘By keeping my eyes and ears open, listening to 
scraps of conversation in political and military clubs ; 
by buying secrets. from traitors, comparing notes 
with other Secret Service men; and by a hundred 
other means.” 
‘Were you never suspected ?’ 
‘I was always suspected. My man, Léffel, was a 
spy placed upon me by a foreign Minister, but I 
was always cute enough completely to disarm their 
suspicions, and they were so certain that I was per- 
fectly harmless that I was more successful than if I 
had not been suspected. However, had I remained 
in. Berlin, that would not have prevented my arrest 
directly war was declared ; so I hopped off to Frank- 
fort, as I wanted to find out where the 18th Army 
Corps was going,’ 
‘How did you manage to rescue me last night ?’ 
Vivian laughed. ‘It might have been awkward,’ 
he replied. ‘I soon found the road I wanted, and 
incidentally the motors. When I got back to the 
place where I had left you, and you were not there, I 
guessed what had happened. I looked about, found 
you, thought out a plan for rescuing you, and— 
there you are.’ 
Oliver admired the nonchalant manner in which 
Vivian spoke of the affair, as if failure was a thing 
he never contemplated ; and he felt that with such 
a companion it would have to be a big difficulty 
they could not overcome.
-P-A-G-E-53
  VIVIAN EXPLAINS, 43 
‘The one thing that troubled me last night,’ said 
Vivian, ‘ was how to get rid of Léffel without arousing 
his suspicions; for he could have made things very 
awkward. He'll be quiet enough for a few hours, 
for he’s sure to be arrested as a spy, and it will 
take him some time to clear himself. Imagine our 
friend Eckhardt’s rage when he finds we have 
escaped ;’ and Vivian laughed joyously. ‘Still, we 
are not yet out of the wood,’ he said ; ‘ hence our little 
disguise ;’ and he pointed to his false moustache. 
‘By this time, in all probability, a great many 
people are on the lookout for us.’ 
The truth of this remark was very soon to be 
proved. 
While Vivian had been talking he had kept the 
little boat at full speed, and they cut through the 
water at a great rate. It was a magnificent day, 
and the scenery of this most beautiful part of the 
Rhine looked its best. Grand old ruins towered 
among the vineyards and rich orchards on the slopes 
of the hills, and here and there modern villas nestled 
among luxuriant gardens, or beautiful chAteaux were 
seen in the midst of parks; while above was a 
cloudless sky, and below were the translucent waters 
of the Rhine. It seemed impossible to think of 
war, and the time slipped by till the wonderful old 
“Mouse Tower’ built on the rocks in the centre of 
the river, coming into view, showed that they were 
at Bingen, and entering that part of the river which 
runs between towering rocks, 
After passing Bingen they noticed for the first 
time that heavy troop-trains were puffing along the 
left bank, and this again brought to the travellers’ 
minds the stern reality of the moment. The sun was

shut out occasionally, too; and the rugged rocky 
slopes were dotted with the ruins of old castles, 
standing up like grisly skeletons. 
Oliver glanced up at the jagged ruins of the 
Ehrenfels, looking like bleached bones in the sun- 
light. 
‘Makes me shiver to-day, somehow,’ he said. 
‘Just the same effect on me,’ agreed Vivian. 
‘Coming out of the sun into this rocky valley seems 
to me symbolic of Germany’s present attitude, taking 
off the smiling mask and showing the grim features 
underneath.’ 
All went well until they got to Caub, when, just 
as Oliver was admiring the Pfalz, the old pentagonal 
tower built on the rocks in the middle of the stream, 
a boat manned by several soldiers shot out from 
behind the little island, and an officer in the prow, 
with a loaded revolver in his hand, curtly bade Vivian 
lie to or he would shoot him.
-P-A-G-E-55

AN EXCITING JOURNEY. 
7. peremptory tone of the officer precluded all 
idea of disobedience, and just whispering to 
Oliver, ‘Take your cue from me,’ Vivian, with a 
charming smile, at once stopped the motor, raised 
his hat in the most approved German style, and 
in very broken German said, ‘Certainly, Herr 
Lieutenant.’ 
The soldier brought his boat alongside the motor, 
and, still pointing his revolver at the occupants, said, 
‘Who are you ?’ 
‘My name is Cyrus Wegg, and my companion is 
Cornelius Schrank. We’. 
‘I'll ask his name when I want it, interrupted 
the officer rudely. ‘Where are you from ?’ 
‘Bingen, where we’ve been staying for a few 
days; and we are returning to Bonn, where we are 
students at the university. My’ 
‘Will you answer my questions and not talk so 
much? Have you any papers ?’ 
‘Papers, Herr Lieutenant? No. Why should we 
have ?’ asked Vivian blandly. 
‘What nationality are you ?’ 
‘I reckon we’re citizens of the United States. 
I am from Boston, and my friend is from New 
Jersey.’ 
The officer glanced sharply at them and at the 
boat, but on hearing that they were Americans his’ 
manner grew more courteous.   
 
-P-A-G-E-56
46 AN EXCITING JOURNEY. 
‘How long have you been in this country ?’ 
‘Six months,’ 
‘You speak beastly bad German. Did you see 
anything of a boat containing two English youths as 
you came along ?’ 
‘Two young fellows dressed in navy blue ?’ asked 
Oliver. 
‘How do I know what they are dressed in? 
Two fellows a little younger than you.’ 
‘Yes; I saw two about five miles up the river.’ 
‘Ha! Going which way ?’ 
‘Coming along. We journeyed with them a little 
way.’ ) 
‘Indeed? And what did they talk of ?’ 
‘Oh, the war,’ 
‘And what did they say of that ?’ 
‘They thought Germany had a big task ;’ and 
Vivian laughed as though at the idea, 
One of the soldiers whispered a word to the 
officer, who replied fiercely, ‘Shut up, fool! Is 
that fellow an English lad of sixteen ?’ pointing to 
Oliver, who with his false moustache looked at least 
twenty. Then to Vivian, ‘How fast can your boat 
travel?’ 
‘About ten miles an hour.’ 
The officer looked at his watch. ‘Couldn’t have 
done the journey in the time,’ he said, and then told 
his men to pull back behind the island. 
‘Have we your permission to proceed?’ asked 
Vivian blandly. 
The officer made some reply that sounded like 
‘You can go to the devil!’ and Vivian went ahead, 
taking care not to exceed the ten miles an hour until 
a bend in the river hid them from sight; then he
-P-A-G-E-57
AN EXCITING JOURNEY. 47 
put his motor at top speed, and at a good twenty 
miles an hour they raced on. 
‘It’s getting warm,’ he said; ‘they’re on the 
lookout for us. Léffel’s managed to explain affairs, 
and didn’t rise to my bait. When I told him we 
were going down the river I thought he would at 
once come to the conclusion that we were going to 
attempt the train, but I guess he’s got back to 
Mainz and found the boat gone.’ 
‘Your American dodge worked well,’ smiled Oliver. 
‘Germany ’s doing all she knows to secure Ameri- 
can sympathy, and citizens of the great “U-nited 
States” will be popular for a while. But we must 
hustle, as our American cousins say, or we shall 
never get out of Germany.’ 
They raced along till they reached a lonely stretch 
of the river just past the celebrated Loreley rock. 
All the way along Vivian had been absorbed in deep 
thought. Suddenly he looked up. ‘We shall have 
to mind our p’s and q’s when we get to Coblenz,’ he 
said; ‘the news has evidently been telegraphed to 
stop us. Coblenz has a big garriaon, and they ‘wy 
certainly be on the lookout for us.’ 
‘What shall we do ?’ 
‘I wish I knew. Anyway, we must once more 
alter our nationality. I’ve got a change of clothing 
aboard, and we must convert ourselves into German 
“nuts.” Your German will pass muster anywhere, 
and mine is pretty good. We must be Bavarians if 
we are stopped again.’ 
The boat was run into a little cove, the flannels 
and the tourist suit abandoned, the false moustaches 
removed, and, with the clothes, dropped overboard. 
Then the two donned the clothes Vivian had with 
 
-P-A-G-E-58

him, and soon they looked like typical German 
students, both wearing student-caps. 
These preparations took some time, and they 
talked while they made the necessary changes. 
Suddenly Vivian held up his hand and listened. 
‘I thought I heard somebody moving on the 
shore,’ he said. 
Both looked, but could see nothing. Some bushes 
grew close down to the water's edge, and it was just 
possible for some one to be concealed there. 
‘It won’t do to run risks,’ said Vivian. ‘I’m 
going to land and have a look around.’ 
In a couple of minutes both of them were ashore 
and hunting about among the bushes, when a rough- 
looking fellow of the peasant class started up and 
began walking off. 
‘Hallo!’ shouted Vivian; ‘what are you doing 
here ?’ 
The man, who was a powerful-looking fellow with 
narrow, squinting eyes, glared at the two youths as 
though sizing up their strength; then he answered, 
‘I’ve been having a sleep ;’ and he rubbed his eyes. 
‘Just woke up ?’ 
“Yes, sir.’ 
‘Which way are you going, my man ?’ 
‘I’m going home.’ 
‘Ah, I wonder whether you’d do me a service ?’ 
‘What is it ?’ 
‘We’re not far from Urbar, are we ?’ 
“A mile and a half, and a stiff climb.’ 
‘Well, would you send a telegram from there for 
me ?’ 
The man’s eyes glistened for a moment. ‘It’s a 
long way.’
-P-A-G-E-59
AN EXCITING JOURNEY. 49 
Vivian took a piece of paper from his pocket and 
wrote thereon: ‘To Von Lessing, Hotel Metropole, 
Cologne. Shall arrive to-night.—Frirz.’ 
‘Here, send this wire from the station, will you ?’ 
he said. ‘You can keep the change;’ and he gave 
the man a five-mark piece. 
The fellow took the paper, read it, and gripped 
the money. 
‘Good, Herr Student,’ he said, and strode off at a 
good pace. 
Vivian and Oliver went back to the boat. 
‘Fools that we were,’ said the former; ‘I believe 
that fellow overheard what we were talking about. 
If he understands English it will be awkward; at 
any rate, his suspicions are aroused. He’ll probably 
think we’re Frenchmen. Anyway, it will take him 
some time to get to Urbar, or St Goar, and he can’t 
give any information till he gets to one place or 
the other. Now away we go, and may good luck 
attend us.” 
The little motor-boat simply flew along, and in 
an hour Boppard was reached, and they were passing 
the town, when a party of Hussars came galloping 
along the river-bank. They shouted and gesticu- 
lated for those in the boat to stop, but Vivian com- 
pressed his lips and gripped the tiller with a firm 
hand. 
‘We're in for it, Oliver,’ he said. 
Seeing the boat did not stop, several of the soldiers 
opened fire, and the bullets came singing unpleasantly 
near. 
‘Lie in the bottom of the boat,’ cried Vivian ; 
but Oliver did not budge. 
Vivian steered across the river to get as far away 
K.K. D  
-P-A-G-E-60
  50 AN EXCITING JOURNEY. 
as he could from the soldiers; and seeing this, half- 
a-dozen men dismounted, and, kneeling, took more 
careful aim, with the result that two bullets struck 
the boat. 
‘They ’re pretty good shots for cavalry,’ muttered 
Vivian grimly. ‘Thank goodness! the river is 
fairly wide here. But there’s that confounded bend 
to manage.’ 
The horsemen were able to keep up with the boat 
for a little way; but once round the bend, Vivian 
got into mid-stream, and the Hussars fell behind, 
though they still kept on firing. A town was before 
them, and it was certain the soldiers would give the 
alarm there. 
‘If they’ve got a steamer we’re done,’ said 
Vivian ; but at top speed they tore on, and though 
the bargemen on the river stared at them, they got 
safely away, and began to breathe more freely. 
“All chance of getting by Coblenz is gone, though,’ 
said Vivian ; ‘but we must outwit the beggars some- 
how.’ Suddenly an idea struck him. ‘It’s risky, 
but we must do it,’ he said, ‘for the railway is out 
of the question. We’ve passed several steamers ; 
they ’re still running. Our only chance will be to 
get on one unobserved.’ 
For another fifteen miles they kept on; then, 
about two miles from Coblenz, Vivian ran ashore, 
and in a quiet spot they landed. He stripped him- 
self, waded tothe boat, headed her for the opposite 
shore, lashed the tiller, fixed the motor at full speed, 
and as she dashed across the river he dived into the 
water and swam back to Oliver. 
The latter, as Vivian dried himself and hastily 
dressed, watched the little motor go speeding
-P-A-G-E-61
AN EXCITING JOURNEY. 51 
across and dash itself to pieces on the opposite 
shore. 
Perfectly unmoved, Vivian, when he had finished 
dressing, said, ‘Now, Oliver, we’ll go into the lion’s 
den. The express boat from Mainz stops at Coblenz, 
and with luck we may get aboard. Also, with bad 
luck we may get into prison. In an hour or so we 
shall know which is likely to happen ;’ and with a 
beating heart Oliver set off with his companion to 
enter Coblenz. 
   
-P-A-G-E-62
CHAPTER VII 
THE FIRST BRUSH WITH THE GERMANS. 
HE very audacity of the idea promised well for 
its success. It was not likely to occur to the 
Teutonic mind that the two youths for whom they 
were looking would dare to walk into that strong- 
hold of militarism, Coblenz. So Vivian and Oliver, 
whistling German student-songs, and looking like 
typical German students, went gaily along unchal- 
lenged, passing a word every now and then with 
enthusiastic ‘Junkers’ whom they met. 
Soldiers were everywhere, and no one gave way 
more deferentially to the self-important Prussian 
officers, or raised their hats more promptly to the 
regimental colours, than did the two English lads. 
They entered the town, mixed with the crowd 
shouting the everlasting ‘Deutschland iiber Alles!’ 
and went on past the Castle to the steamboat pier 
below the Bridge of Boats, where Vivian took two 
tickets for Bonn. 
Together with some students, and soldiers going 
’ to Cologne, they waited till the steamer came in, 
and without accident they got aboard. When they 
were out on the river Vivian winked knowingly to 
Oliver as they noticed several boats full of soldiers 
pulling about, looking sharply up and down stream. 
Oliver could hardly help smiling to think how they 
had outwitted the military, and feeling perfectly 
comfortable, they had dinner aboard, and quietly 
disembarked at Bonn unsuspected.
-P-A-G-E-63
THE FIRST BRUSH WITH THE GERMANS. 53 
‘So far, so good,’ whispered Vivian. ‘Now for the 
most ticklish part of our enterprise.’ 
The afternoon was waning as the two strolled 
into the town, and Vivian kept his eyes sharply open. 
The talk in Bonn was all of war, as it had been 
in Coblenz, and entering a gun-shop, Vivian bought 
two automatic pistols and some ammunition. 
‘We may want these before we cross the frontier,’ 
he said, ‘Can you use one, Oliver ?’ 
‘T am a pretty fair shot.’ 
‘Then don’t hesitate to fire should occasion arise ; 
remember, more than our bare lives is at stake.’ 
‘Rely on me, if we get into a corner, to follow 
your lead. We have already been fired on, so we 
may look upon ourselves as at war with Germany.’ 
Vivian’s next purchase was a motor-cycle with a 
side-car. 
‘It’s the only means of escape left to us,’ he said, 
‘and I expect we shall find it difficult to cross the 
frontier. This is a part of Germany I don’t know 
very well, and the next job is to get a good road- 
map.’ 
About this there was little difficulty, and enter- 
ing a small restaurant, Vivian studied his map 
assiduously. 
Just as the sun was setting the motor-bicycle was 
well stocked with petrol, some sandwiches and a 
bottle of wine were bought, and the two adventurers 
slowly drove out of Bonn along the road to Briihl, 
which unfortunately ran parallel with the Rhine. 
They could thus be seen both from the passing 
trains, all laden with soldiers, and from the river, 
where at any moment they might be hailed from 
patrol-boats, did they meet any. But fortune  
-P-A-G-E-64
  54 THE FIRST BRUSH WITH THE GERMANS. 
favoured them, and after half-an-hour’s run they 
reached Berzdorf, whence they followed the road 
towards Brith], leaving the Rhine behind them. 
‘I’m jolly glad,’ said Oliver, ‘for I’m beginning 
to hate that old river.’ 
‘It’s given us some exciting moments, I'll admit,’ 
smiled Vivian. ‘And now hold on to your hat, for 
I’m going to see what this machine is capable of.’ 
And in Vivian’s hands it seemed capable of a 
good deal, for they literally flew along, scaring the 
peasants and a few policemen they met, one of 
whom vainly shouted out to them to stop. 
Vivian’s intention was to make for Aix-la- 
Chapelle, and to try to cross the frontier there. 
From Briihl to Duren the road is splendid, and 
nothing occurred till they reached the bridge over 
the Ruhr, where they were stopped by a sentry, 
who positively refused to allow them to pass; and 
when Vivian attempted to do so, the man brought 
his bayonet down so threateningly that Vivian had 
to give in, and requested to see the sergeant in 
charge. 
The sergeant was a great, fat, bullying-looking 
fellow, and to him Vivian told a long tale of being 
obliged to reach Eschweiler that night, in order to 
see an aunt who was ill, and from whom he expected 
a substantial legacy. Eventually two twenty-mark 
pieces changed hands, and the sergeant called out 
gruffly to the sentry that it was all right. Breath- 
ing freely again, the two went on. 
‘I thought that confounded fellow had got us,’ 
said Vivian when he had put a mile between them 
and the bridge; ‘but when I saw the sergeant’s 
nose, I guessed anything which would mean beer or
-P-A-G-E-65
  THE FIRST BRUSH WITH THE GERMANS, 55 
wine to him would weigh more than duty. Any- 
how, I don’t want any more such encounters.’ 
After passing Duren, Vivian pulled up in a lonely 
spot, and by the light of the lamp examined his 
map. ‘We’re getting near the frontier,’ he said, 
‘and I don’t think it is a bit of good trying to get 
through at Aix-la-Chapelle. We should be stopped 
there, for a certainty. I think our best plan is to 
turn south and try to sneak across at some un- 
guarded point.’ 
“You’re in command, and know the country 
better than I do,’ said Oliver; ‘I can’t offer any 
opinion.’ 
‘Then away we go,’ said Vivian. 
They had for a good part of the way travelled 
in sight of the railway line, and train after train, 
full of men, guns, horses, and wagons, had been 
seen. Now they left the railway, and for several 
miles went across the country by lanes and narrow 
roads, till presently they came in sight of a village 
in which numerous lights were seen, and from which 
a noise, like that occasioned by a great number of 
men, was heard. 
‘It will be dangerous to go pushing in there 
until we know what is going on,’ said Vivian; 
‘we ll hide our machine and get forward on foot.’ 
Doing this, they soon saw that beyond the village 
was the railway again, and a fair-sized station. 
The village itself was full of German troops in 
hundreds and in thousands, and it was clear they 
were detraining there. 
‘We must be near the frontier,’ whispered Vivian 
as he and Oliver crept silently away after having 
reconnoitred. ‘Now I wonder where we are.’
-P-A-G-E-66
56 THE FIRST BRUSH WITH THE GERMANS. 
The lamp of the cycle had been extinguished 
before they left the machine, and it was not safe 
to relight it; but Vivian had a pocket electric- 
lamp, and by the light of this, after returning to 
the cycle, they both examined the map, and came 
to the conclusion that they were at Herbsthal, the 
last station on the German side of the frontier. 
‘We must get round to the other side of the 
village, and find out whether the troops are halting 
here or crossing the frontier,’ said Vivian. 
But this was a task which required the greatest 
care. They pushed the cycle for about half a mile 
back in the direction from which they had come, 
and then, mounting, went some mile or so farther 
before they struck a cross-road which led south. 
Following this, and steering solely by the stars, 
Vivian made a detour, and presently got again near 
to the road leading out of Herbsthal. Here it was 
imperative to dismount, as the noise of the motor 
would at once have betrayed them. 
Going across some fields on foot, and wading 
through a stream, they approached the main road, 
when the tramp, tramp, tramp of thousands of feet 
moving in time fell upon their ears. The crunching 
of wheels, jingle of harness, and trampling of hoofs 
at once proved that an army was on the march; 
and there could be very little doubt that the 
Germans were advancing. 
The invasion of Belgium was being carried out ! 
No sooner had Vivian satisfied himself of this 
than he whispered to Oliver, ‘Come on, old chap! 
We know all we want to; at any risk now we must 
cross the frontier.’ 
They found their machine, and after another look
-P-A-G-E-67
  THE FIRST BRUSH WITH THE GERMANS. 57 
at his map Vivian set the engine in motion. They 
went straight ahead, and were moving almost 
parallel with the invading Germans. The moon 
was still bright, and Vivian had not relit his lamp, 
as its glare would have betrayed them. 
‘If it wasn’t for the confounded noise of this 
machine,’ he said, ‘we might get through unnoticed. 
I’d give ten such machines now for a couple of 
ordinary push-bikes.’ 
Proceeding at a fair speed, they suddenly turned 
a bend in the road, when immediately in front of 
them a party of cavalry appeared. Their square- 
topped caps and long lances showed at once that they 
were Lancers, and no sooner were the two observed 
than a gruff voice shouted out to them in German 
to stop. 
‘Get your pistol ready,’ said Vivian curtly, ‘and 
fire when I tell you.’ 
While his heart beat wildly, Oliver drew his 
pistol, which he held ready underneath the apron 
of the side-car. 
‘Pull up and dismount,’ cried a sergeant, riding 
towards them. 
‘I do not understand,’ replied Vivian in French, 
reducing speed but not stopping. 
‘Hit this fellow over the head and pitch him off 
the machine,’ cried out the sergeant; and a couple 
of troopers were riding up, when Vivian cried, 
‘Fire, Oliver!’ and at the same moment his own 
pistol flashed out, and the sergeant, with a wild 
ery, fell. 
A Lancer came charging down at Oliver, and 
when his lance-point was within a couple of feet of 
him Oliver fired, and the horse, struck, plunged
-P-A-G-E-68
  58 THE FIRST BRUSH WITH THE GERMANS, 
violently, throwing its rider, who fell almost across 
the machine. 
Two more shots rang out from Vivian, and two 
other men fell; then, swerving the machine aside, 
in order to avoid the men and horses lying in the 
road, he dashed ahead. As they rode off half-a- 
dozen bullets came whizzing by them, and the 
thunder of horses’ hoofs showed they were pursued. 
‘Can you guide the machine, Oliver?’ asked 
Vivian. 
“Yes; I am a bit of a motor-cyclist.’ 
‘Lean across, then, and seize the handle-bars.’ 
Oliver did so; and Vivian, turning half-round, 
reloaded his pistol, and emptied it twice in the 
direction of their pursuers. 
‘I don’t suppose I’ve hit any one, but I’ll bet 
I’ve frightened some,’ he said; and taking the 
handle-bars again from Oliver, he sped forward. 
They soon outdistanced the cavalry, and slackened 
speed somewhat, when again, some distance ahead, 
they saw three horsemen. 
‘Confound it! I thought we’d passed their 
scouts,’ cried Vivian. ‘Get your pistol ready 
again, Oliver, and when I tell you, fire without 
compunction.’ 
The horsemen in front, hearing the machine 
coming, halted, and shouted out to them that no 
one could pass. Vivian disobeyed the summons ; 
whereupon a soldier said, ‘No Belgians can pass! 
Stop, or we fire !’ 
‘We’re Englishmen,’ shouted back Vivian.— 
‘Fire, Oliver!’ and the flash of Oliver’s pistol was 
followed by the fall of a soldier. 
Two reports then rang out, and Oliver felt his cap 
 
-P-A-G-E-69
  THE FIRST BRUSH WITH THE GERMANS. 59 
being lifted off as though by the wind. At the same 
moment Vivian, guiding the machine with one hand, 
fired with the other. He missed, but the man 
reined back, and as the cycle dashed by, made no 
attempt to follow. The third man turned and 
galloped ahead, as though trying to get away from 
the cycle, but he had little chance; and some half- 
mile farther on the fellow, hearing he was being 
overtaken, drew in to one side, as though to let the 
cycle pass. 
“Shoot him if he moves towards us,’ said Vivian ; 
but the man did not, and they were almost past 
him, when Vivian suddenly pulled up the machine, 
and jumping off, pistol in hand ran towards the 
German. ‘Hands up!’ he cried. ‘Surrender, or 
I’ll shoot !’ 
Instantly the man dropped his bridle and held 
up his hands. 
‘Throw down that lance and dismount,’ ordered 
Vivian ; and the soldier did so, asking, ‘Are you 
French or Belgians ?’ 
‘Neither. .We’re English.’ Seizing the arm of 
the man, who was quite a young fellow, he led him 
to the side-car, across which he made him straddle, 
his back being towards Oliver. 
‘If he moves or tries to escape,’ Vivian said to 
Oliver in German, ‘shoot him.—Now, you,’ to the 
unfortunate Uhlan, ‘hang on, if you value your life.’ 
In a few more seconds they were again speeding 
ahead. 
‘First blood to us, and the first trophy,’ chuckled 
Vivian. ‘We must be well across the frontier, 
and we'll make a present of our prisoner to the 
Belgians.’
-P-A-G-E-70
60 THE FIRST BRUSH WITH THE GERMANS. 
In less than half-an-hour they approached Verviers, 
a town of some size, just as the day was breaking. 
Proceeding slowly, they were entering the long, 
straggling street, when several soldiers, who were 
on guard outside a decent-sized house, sprang into 
the road, and presenting their rifles, demanded to 
know who they were and whence they came. 
‘We are Englishmen,’ answered Vivian, ‘and have 
news of vital importance for your officer, Lead me 
at once to him, for the Germans are at your very 
doors.’ 
‘The Germans!’ replied the man incredulously, 
speaking in French. ‘There is no war yet, monsieur. 
There must be some mistake.’ 
‘We captured this man not ten miles from here,’ 
said Vivian impatiently, ‘and there are a hundred 
thousand following him. Do you not know a 
German soldier when you see him ?’ 
The prisoner by this time had stood up, and was 
gazing curiously around him. 
‘Peste! he is German enough,’ growled one of 
the soldiers.—‘ Sergeant, let ’s fetch Captain Doren ; 
this looks serious.’ 
‘So serious that if you don’t hurry, the Germans 
will fetch your captain for you,’ said Vivian dryly ; 
and the man at once departed on his errand.
-P-A-G-E-71
CHAPTER VIII 
BELGIUM FILLS THE GAP. 
N two minutes he returned with a stout, dark 
officer in the crimson pantaloons and green tunic 
of the Belgian Lancers. 
Captain Doren was a very courteous gentleman, 
and, speaking in French, he asked Vivian what was 
his news. In a few words Vivian explained, and 
Captain Doren complimented him on his narrow 
escape and the capture he had made. The German 
Lancer was removed under a guard, and Vivian 
and Oliver accompanied Captain Doren into the 
house. 
‘The news you bring me is most alarming,’ said 
the Belgian. ‘I was informed last night that an 
ultimatum had been handed to the Government at 
Brussels, but that no answer had yet been given.’ 
‘Captain, the German way is to occupy a country 
first, and send an ultimatum afterwards.’ 
‘So it would appear. Anyhow, we must oppose 
their advance until we get further orders. Will you 
excuse me?’ and going into the street, he gave his 
sergeant an order, and in ten minutes a squadron 
of Lancers went off in the direction of the frontier. 
‘Now, gentlemen,’ he said to Oliver and Vivian, 
‘I presume you do not want to stop here ?’ 
‘I want to get on to Litge, as I must forward some 
important messages to England.’ 
‘Then, if you would oblige me by leaving a letter 
for General Leman, who is in command at Fort de
-P-A-G-E-72
  62 BELGIUM FILLS THE GAP. 
Fleron, I should be your debtor, for I cannot spare 
a man from here.’ 
‘I shall have great pleasure.’ 
‘In ten minutes I shall have it ready; then if 
you will breakfast with me I shall be honoured.’ 
After their night’s adventures, both Vivian and 
Oliver were very hungry, and they were soon 
breakfasting with Captain Doren. The meal finished, 
they accompanied the Belgian officer to the top of 
the house, from the flat roof of which a good view, 
of the surrounding country could be obtained. They 
had not been looking round many minutes, when 
Oliver saw some pufis of smoke amongst the bushes, 
a mile or two away. Presently dark masses of 
moving men were seen on the slope of the hill, then 
rapid spitfire flashes and more smoke. 
‘The first shots are being fired in what I believe 
will be the greatest war the world has ever scen,’ 
_ said Vivian gravely. 
‘I should say your little brush with the German 
Uhlans was the first encounter,’ said Captain Doren. 
‘Perhaps so,’ said Vivian; ‘but this seems likely 
to be a small battle.’ 
‘We cannot hope to make a battle of it,’ replied 
Captain Doren; ‘we must delay them, and then 
fall back. But I think it is high time you went; 
the roads are open now, but one cannot say how 
long they may remain so.’ 
Vivian and Oliver parted from Captain Doren 
with regret. 
‘He is a gallant fellow,’ said Vivian, ‘apparently 
as unconcerned as though on manceuvres; yet there 
is very little chance of his ever leaving Verviers 
alive.’
-P-A-G-E-73
BELGIUM FILLS THE GAP. 63 
‘If all the army are like him, the Germans may 
have a tough job,’ said Oliver. 
“A day or two will show,’ replied Vivian; and 
mounting their cycle, they started off, having to 
pass through groups of terrified villagers, who, 
hearing the dread news, were leaving their homes 
in haste. 
There was little chance of losing one’s way in 
travelling from Verviers to Liége, and following the 
road pointed out, Vivian rode along beside the river 
through Nessonvaux and Fraipont, till at the cross- 
roads a finger-post showed him the road to Fleron. 
It was a beautiful country through which they 
passed, well wooded and cultivated, the little villages 
looking the picture of peace and happiness; while 
the agricultural population, farther removed from 
the zone of danger, went calmly about their work, 
oblivious of, or indifferent to, the fearful storm about 
to break upon them. 
‘Poor beggars!’ said Oliver; ‘I wonder whether 
they realise the fearful menace which. threatens 
them.’ 
‘I wonder,’ echoed Vivian; and they sped along 
to Fleron. 
On their left, the town of Lidge, with its 
numerous spires, presented a fine picture, standing 
as it does in undulating, well- wooded country, 
through which run the wide waters of the Meuse. 
Turning their gaze from the city, Vivian and Oliver 
saw the cupola of Fort Fleron, looking like a great 
iron ant-hill. 
The fort itself was triangular, surrounded by a 
moat, Outside the walls, engineers were placing 
wire entanglements at the foot of the glacis; and Te ee
-P-A-G-E-74

to an officer Vivian said he had an important 
despatch for General Leman, 
He and Oliver were then conducted through a 
. small door in the masonry, across an inner ditch, 
under an arch, and to the commandant’s quarters, 
which were in the inner fort. In a small room, 
seated at a table covered with papers, General 
Leman was found. He was a_high-cheek-boned, 
gaunt-looking man, who glanced very sharply at 
the two English lads as he listened to Vivian's 
story, after reading Captain Doren’s letter. 
‘This is serious news you bring me,’ he said; 
‘it is a flagrant breach of international convention. 
How many troops do you think they have here ?’ 
‘I know the 7th and 9th Army Corps are here, 
and probably the 10th is following; and there is 
at least one cavalry division.’ 
‘“H’m—125,000 men. And who is in command ?’ 
‘General von Emmich,’ 
‘Ha! I know him well. He was with me on 
last year’s manceuvres. A conceited, blundering 
fellow. I have hopes if he is given a free hand. 
But this news, sir, is of the utmost importance ; 
I must at once lay it before His Majesty, who is in 
Litge. Will you two come with me ?’ 
“We are hardly in fit costume to appear before 
a king,’ smiled Vivian. 
‘Tush, sir! this is war-time. His Majesty cares 
nothing for appearances. You have rendered us a 
great service, and the king would like to thank you.’ 
In ten minutes Oliver and Vivian were seated 
with General Leman in his motor, and were making 
for Litge at a rate that would have horrified a 
London policeman. Twenty minutes saw them in
-P-A-G-E-75
  BELGIUM FILLS THE GAP. 65 
the city. The king was at the citadel, and thither 
General Leman drove. The guards presented arms, 
and at once passed him inside. 
General Leman and his companions were con- 
ducted to a room in which a number of staff officers 
were present, and these stared curiously at the 
General and his two companions. A tall, pale, 
handsome young man who was sitting at the head 
of the table rose as the three entered, and General 
Leman gave him a military salute, while Oliver 
and Vivian bowed low, for they knew they were 
in the presence of Belgium’s gallant king. 
‘Ha, General,’ said the king, ‘what news ?’ 
‘Grave news, sire; the Germans are marching on 
Verviers.’ 
Oliver noticed that the king turned a shade 
paler; then he said in even tones, ‘Gentlemen, it is 
the inevitable that has happened ; only it has come 
a little sooner than we expected. Our neutrality 
must and shall be respected.’ 
A chorus of approbation arose, and when this 
had subsided the king asked General Leman for 
particulars. 
‘These gentlemen, sire, can tell you more than I; 
what I know I learnt from them.’ 
The king turned a questioning gaze on Oliver and 
Vivian; whereupon the latter told the king what 
the actual position was. His Majesty listened with 
great attention, then asked to whom he was indebted 
for the news. 
‘I am Lieutenant Drummond of the Coldstream 
Guards, in Germany on special service; and thi§ is 
my friend Oliver Hastings, whom I chanced to 
meet in Frankfort in a slight difficulty.’ 
KK. E

King Albert shook them both warmly by the 
hand and thanked them, saying they must have 
had an adventurous journey through Germany. 
They briefly outlined their adventures, which were 
listened to with great interest by the officers present, 
many of whom laughed outright at the idea of 
Vivian and Oliver walking boldly into Coblenz, and 
thus outwitting the Germans. 
Then the king spoke alone with General Leman 
for a few minutes; after which he turned to those 
assembled. 
‘Gentlemen,’ he said, his eyes flashing as he 
spoke, ‘never since 1830 has a graver hour sounded 
for Belgium. You have already heard the decision 
of the Government and myself, that if our country 
was invaded we would resist to the last. The 
necessity has now arisen, and a solemn duty is 
imposed upon us. We must be united; we must 
be courageous. Are you decided to maintain 
inviolate the sacred patrimony of our ancestors ?’ 
A deep-throated answer of ‘To the death, sire!’ 
rolled round the room. 
‘Thanks, gentlemen,’ said the king; ‘I expected 
no other answer. The Government and myself are 
fully confident that the army is capable of fulfilling 
its task. I know no one will fail in his duty, and 
that every one is ready, should the necessity arise, 
to yield up his life for the welfare of his country. 
For my part, I am not a soldier, but I will share 
with you every danger; I will to the last maintain 
my constitutional oath. I have faith in our destiny 
and in our ultimate success. A country which 
defends itself wins the respect of every one, and 
cannot perish. God will be with us!’
-P-A-G-E-77
BELGIUM FILLS THE GAP. 67 
Tremendous applause followed these words, and 
then measures of defence were at once set afoot. 
Troops were set to work to tear up the railway 
lines running into Litge, to blow up bridges, dig 
trenches, and to seize important points; while 
reinforcements were despatched to the forts. 
When the officers had departed on their various 
errands, the king asked Vivian and Oliver whether 
they would like him to send them on to Ostend 
under a safe escort. 
‘I thank your Majesty,’ replied Vivian, ‘but I 
crave permission to remain in Belgium. I have 
some important messages to send to England, and I 
must await a reply. In the meantime, if I can be 
of any service to you against the Germans, I shall 
be delighted.’ 
‘I accept your services with gratitude——And 
you, Mr Hastings ?’ 
‘I also place my services at your Majesty’s 
disposal.’ 
‘Which I most thankfully accept. But you 
know the German penalty for non-combatants who 
take up arms? It is death. You must accept 
commissions in my army, and I will appoint you 
on General Leman’s staff. What do you say, 
gentlemen ?’ 
‘We shall be deeply honoured.’ 
‘And you, General, will you have these 
gentlemen ?’ 
‘I will have any one who can be of use at this 
crisis,’ said the General bluntly; and the king, 
handing General Leman two blank commissions, 
said, ‘Get one of your aides-de-camp to see them 
appointed to a regiment; get them uniforms and
-P-A-G-E-78
ee 
68 BELGIUM FILLS THE GAP. 
look after them, for I must at once return to 
Brussels.’ : 
Leaving the king’s presence, in two minutes the 
three were in the street. 
| ‘I have an hour’s business to transact here,’ said 
| the General; ‘if you are ready at the end of that 
time I will take you back to Fleron in my car.’ 
‘We shall be quite ready, General,’ said Vivian. 
‘Be here, then ;’ and, with a curt salute, General 
Leman dashed away in his car, the crowd wildly 
cheering him as he went. 
Vivian wrote a long message in cipher, and after 
some difficulty got it away from the Post-Office, 
arranging with the authorities to send the reply 
on to Fort Fleron. 
By this time they were due to meet the General, 
and punctual to the minute he drove up. He 
hardly spoke two words during their return ride, 
and on reaching the fort, silently led the way 
inside. 
As they were crossing the courtyard Oliver saw 
an officer with a blood-stained handkerchief tied 
round his left arm. ‘Captain Doren,’ he said to 
Vivian. 
Before the latter could reply Captain ~Doren 
advanced to General Leman and saluted. 
‘Well, Doren, what has happened at Verviers ?’ 
‘The enemy came on in overwhelming numbers, 
General. We engaged their cavalry and held them 
off for an hour, but had to retire after losing seven 
killed and about twenty wounded.’ 
They all went to the General’s office, where 
Captain Doren gave particulars of the defence -of 
Verviers. The German prisoner* whom he had  
-P-A-G-E-79
BELGIUM FILLS THE GAP, 69 
brought with him was sent for and interrogated as 
to the numbers and composition of the invading 
army, which he gave without the slightest reserve. 
“You could do nothing else, captain,’ said General 
Leman after hearing all. ‘And now, you and these 
two Englishmen have met before, I think.’ 
‘Yes, General.’ 
‘Well, take them and look after them. They are 
attached to our army with honorary rank. Get them 
appointed and clothed ; then report to me for duty.’ 
Captain Doren at once took Vivian and Oliver 
under his care. 
‘Well, Englishmen,’ he said, ‘the ball is set fairly 
rolling. Now what are your wishes ?’ 
‘To see something of the fighting,’ said both 
Vivian and Oliver at once. 
‘Then you’re just in the right place, for there 
will be enough fighting here directly to satisfy any 
one. You'll want to be attached to some regiment. 
What do you say to my own, the Ist Lancers? 
We’re a crack corps.’ 
‘We should like it immensely.’ 
‘I need not ask you if you can ride; all your 
countrymen can.’ 
“Yes, we’re all right there.’ 
‘Then come with me; we’ll find the tailor of my 
troop, and he will run his tape over you. There 
are plenty of uniforms in Lidge, and in a few hours 
he will have you fitted.’ 
The tailor having attended, both Oliver and 
Vivian said they could do with a few hours’ sleep, 
and in half-an-hour were making up for the sleepless 
night they had passed,
-P-A-G-E-80
  CHAPTER IX. 
THE FIRST GLIMPSE OF GERMAN METHODS. 
N the afternoon Oliver was awakened by Vivian. 
‘Now, young man,’ he said, ‘you’re a soldier, 
and as such can only indulge in sleeping when 
there ’s nothing else to do.’ 
«I’ve been a soldier for some months,’ said Oliver, 
jumping up. ‘Did I never mention that I joined 
the Surrey Yeomanry last year, and trained with 
them in May ?’ 
‘Never a word, you young oyster. Why, this is 
splendid! It’s your dad’s regiment, isn’t it ?’ 
“Yes; he got me a lieutenancy.’ 
‘Comrades in arms,’ cried Vivian mock-heroically. 
‘Noll, I feel we shall do great deeds. Thank 
goodness! I can now throw off all disguise, and can 
meet these Germans as I’ve always longed to, in the 
field, face to face, and with a good sword in my 
hand.’ 
At that moment there came a knock at the door, 
and the tailor of Captain Doren’s troop entered. 
He had with him two complete uniforms. 
‘My word!’ cried Vivian, ‘we shall be smart 
birds in these feathers.’ 
With the tailor’s help the two English lads 
were soon in full uniform—scarlet breeches, green 
Lancer tunics, top-boots, spurs, lance-caps, and all 
complete. 
Oliver looked admiringly at Vivian. ‘I say,’ he 
said, ‘ you look slap-up !’
-P-A-G-E-81
  THE FIRST GLIMPSE OF GERMAN METHODS. 71 
‘T don’t want to make you feel vain, or I might 
return the compliment,’ laughed Vivian. 
Just then Captain Doren came along. ‘Now 
you ’re Belgian officers,’ he said; ‘I can fit you up 
with swords and revolvers, and a couple of my 
troopers will lend you horses. We are going out to 
Visé. Will you accompany us ?’ 
‘With pleasure ; but I suppose we first ought to 
report to the General and get permission.’ 
‘That is already obtained.’ 
‘Then away we go, said Oliver impetuously ; 
and in ten minutes, with their squadron of Lancers, 
they were clattering over the drawbridge. 
When they left the fort they could distinctly 
hear the booming of guns, and breaking into a trot, 
they headed northwards. 
‘The Germans are attacking Visé,’ explained 
Captain Doren; ‘but, forewarned, we have blown 
up the bridge and have checked them.’ 
An hour’s ride brought them in sight of the fight. 
The roar of the cannonading was tremendous, An 
aide-de-camp came galloping up, and bade the 
cavalry take up a position on a small hill, whence, 
through their glasses, the officers could see the 
battle. 
The Germans were attempting to throw a bridge 
of boats across the Meuse, but the Belgian Field 
Artillery shelled them so vigorously that again and 
again the working-parties were blown away, while 
concealed infantry plied the supporting troops with 
showers of bullets. 
It was very annoying not being able to get close, 
but there was nothing just then for cavalry to do, 
and so they had to remain inactive. Meanwhile
-P-A-G-E-82
  72 THE FIRST GLIMPSE OF GERMAN METHODS. 
the fight for Visé waxed hotter and hotter. The 
Germans advanced in hordes, and such a volume of 
fire was directed on the town that it was clear the 
loss of the place was only a question of time. An 
order came for Captain Doren’s squadron to move 
down closer to the river. They had not been in 
their new position long, when Oliver, scanning the 
country around through his glasses, thought he saw 
a body of cavalry fording the river some two miles 
below them. He at once drew Vivian’s attention to 
the fact, and he quite agreed with Oliver’s view. 
Captain Doren, without waiting for orders, moved 
down towards the spot; and presently it became 
quite plain that six squadrons of Germans, Lancers 
and Hussars, had succeeded in crossing the river, 
and were advancing to take the single squadron of 
Belgians in the rear. 
‘Men,’ cried Captain Doren, rising in his stirrups, 
‘we’ve got our chance to show these Germans what 
we are made of. Close ranks! Unsling lances!’ 
The lances came out of their buckets, and the 
squadron formed two ranks, Oliver and Vivian in 
front with the other officers. 
At a trot they approached the gray-green mass of 
Germans, who never thought such a handful would 
dare to charge them. This, however, was only 
another of their mistakes. They utterly failed to 
strike that dread into their enemies which for years 
they had been told by their officers they would do. 
The Belgian Lancers approached closer and closer ; 
and the Germans, when the truth bore in upon 
them that this handful of gaily dressed horsemen 
actually intended to charge them, began hurriedly 
. to form line. 
 
-P-A-G-E-83
  THE FIRST GLIMPSE OF GERMAN METHODS. 73 
‘Don’t give them time to form,’ cried Vivian ; 
and Captain Doren, rising in his stirrups and 
waving his sword, cried, ‘Men, for the glory of 
Belgium, charge !’ 
Like a thunderbolt the Belgians dashed upon the 
gray-green troops, and reaching them while they 
were still in disorder, crashed into them. 
Oliver, gripping his horse tightly with his ee 
sword-point well advanced, rode straight at an 
officer and ran him right through the body, with- 
drawing his blade in time to slash a big Uhlan 
across the face and topple him from his saddle. A 
third man fired at him; but Vivian, with a back- 
handed sweep, cut him down. 
‘England for ever!’ he shouted ; and, cutting and 
slashing, before Oliver realised what had happened 
they were through the mass. They had some 
difficulty in reining up their blown horses. 
‘Re-form! re-form!’ cried the officers; and the 
Belgians, facing about, again closed up their ranks, 
and then crashed back through the Germans, thrust- 
ing and cutting till lance-head and sword-blade 
were dimmed with German blood. 
The enemy seemed paralysed, and fought in a dazed 
manner, as men taken utterly by surprise; while the 
Belgians, flushed with victory, yelled in fierce triumph. 
Again Oliver and Vivian came through unscathed ; 
and the squadron, sadly thinned in numbers, once 
more turned about and closed its ranks. 
Fully half the Germans were unhorsed, and the 
remainder were scattered, and seemed undecided 
what to do. The officers were shouting, waving 
their swords, and in some instances striking at the 
troopers with the flats of their blades.
-P-A-G-E-84
74 THE FIRST GLIMPSE OF GERMAN METHODS. 
‘Once more, men!’ cried Captain Doren; and, in 
a compact little mass, the Lancers again dashed at 
the Germans. But these had apparently had enough. 
The reality was so different from manceuvres that 
they would not face the steel again, and when 
the fierce horsemen charged, they turned their horses 
and galloped for the rear, The Belgians got amongst 
them, and thrust and cut till their arms ached. 
Down to the river they drove them, and into the 
water, when Vivian, forgetting he was not in com- 
mand, cried, ‘Dismount, men, and give them a 
volley !’ 
In a trice the Belgians were out of their saddles 
and the magazine-rifles crashed out, killing scores. 
The fire was kept up till the shattered remains of 
that body of cavalry, sadly disillusioned, galloping 
for their lives, and less than a hundred in number, 
got out of range. 
‘Hurrah! hurrah!’ yelled Oliver; ‘that’s a first 
taste for the Kaiser's vaunted cavalry !’ 
The Belgians had suffered heavily also, and less 
than half their number were able to keep their 
saddles. The affair had attracted a small body of 
infantry to the spot, and these made prisoners of 
the unwounded Germans who had been unhorsed, 
and who sullenly gave up their arms. The bearers 
came out to gather the Belgian wounded, and 
Captain Doren rode up and shook Oliver and Vivian 
warmly by the hand. 
‘Thanks, my friends; thanks,’ he said. ‘You 
have helped me to give the enemy a lesson, and to 
avenge our retreat from Verviers.’ 
The Lancers then returned to their original 
position, but by that time the attack on Visé had
-P-A-G-E-85
           THE FIRST GLIMPSE OF GERMAN METHODS. 75 
grown so hot that the Belgians had to retire; and 
as night came on they fell back, flames bursting out 
behind them as they did so. 
The troops were highly elated, however, and felt 
that they had given the Germans such a taste of 
their quality as would convince them that they 
would not cross Belgium with the goose-step, their 
bands playing and their flags flying. 
Captain Doren’s handful of men had to cover 
the retreat, but the Germans did not attempt to 
pursue, and the whole retired towards the forts. 
Captain Doren’s men bivouacked a mile from 
Fort Fleron, and a battery of Field Artillery which 
had been engaged at Visé joined them. Fires were 
lit, and two artillery officers approached the fire by 
which Oliver and Vivian, with Captain Doren, were 
eating their supper. One of the officers was a tall, 
fair man, and in pretty bad French he asked Oliver 
if he happened to have a cigarette upon him. Oliver 
regretted that he had not; but on Captain Doren 
handing his case, this artilleryman entered into 
conversation with Oliver, who could not help smiling 
at his weird French; on which the officer also 
smiled, and muttered in English, ‘This confounded 
lingo is the only drawback to an illigant spree.’ 
‘Hallo!’ cried Oliver ; ‘do you speak English ?’ 
‘Spake English, is it? Faith, I do, and if I had my 
way, would never try to spake any other language.’ 
Vivian looked up, stared at the speaker, and then 
burst out laughing. ‘If you’re not Terence Dwyer, 
then I’m a Dutchman.’ 
The artilleryman stared at Vivian, then blew a 
cloud of smoke down his nose. ‘ Your voice I know,’ 
he said, ‘but I can’t fix ye.’
-P-A-G-E-86
76 HE FIRST GLIMPSE OF GERMAN METHODS. 
‘Drummond of the Guards. We met at your 
mess at Woolwich when I was taking a course 
there.’ 
‘By the powers, so it is!’ cried, the artilleryman. 
‘How @’ ye do, and what on earth brings you here ? 
I thought you were dead.’ 
‘A long way from it, captain.’ 
‘And who’s your friend, this young rascal who 
dares to laugh at my French?’ and the cheery 
Irishman shook a finger at Oliver. 
Introductions and explanations followed, and soon 
all were chatting with that freedom which distin- 
guishes soldiers on service. 
‘And how do you come to be here?’ asked 
Vivian, 
‘Just by accident, the merest accident,’ laughed 
Dwyer. ‘I heard there were likely to be some 
“grand manceuvres” in Belgium, and I applied for 
six months’ leave on urgent private business, came 
over, and, being a horse-artilleryman, just offered 
my services to the Belgians, in case of—er—a bit 
of a divarshun, d’ ye see ?’ 
Vivian whistled. 
‘And there ’s Russell of the Blues with the cavalry, 
Spencer and Parry of the 1st Lifes, Smith of the 
Rifle Brigade, M‘Laren and Tyrwhit of my battery, 
Hewson of the 10th, and a score or so of others.’ 
‘TI should never have thought so much was known 
of what was going on.’ 
‘I don’t know how it leaked out, but there’s 
been a strong suspicion that the old Kaiser would 
be burning powder directly; and so, in case we 
shouldn’t get a chance, a few of the boys got over 
here on spec. Of course if Britain gets drawn in
-P-A-G-E-87
  THE FIRST GLIMPSE OF GERMAN METHODS. 77 
we shall rejoin our own fellows; but I don’t know 
whether she will. I’m no hand at polities.’ 
A pleasant hour was spent, and the talk was, of 
course, largely of the fight. 
‘It’s going to be the biggest scrap on record,’ 
said Dwyer; ‘but it’s not going to be a walk over 
for the “Square-heads.” Their artillery wasn’t 
badly served to-day, but my guns quite held their 
own; and my opinion of their infantry is that, as 
Tommy would say, “they can’t shoot for nuts.” 
With the forces they had they ought to have cleared 
us out of Visé in half-an-hour. By the way,’ he 
said presently, ‘what was that cavalry affair I heard 
of ?—a squadron of Belgians cutting up ‘six of 
Germans. Did you hear of it ?’ 
An infantry officer who had joined the group, 
hearing the remark and understanding English, said, 
‘The heroes of that fight are before you, captain ;’ 
and he related the story. : 
‘By the powers, boys!’ cried Dwyer, jumping up 
and shaking hands with all round the fire, ‘that’s 
glorious. Why the dickens wasn’t I with you? 
By Jove, Drummond! that would have meant the 
D.S.O. for you, if you’d been serving with our own 
troops.’ 
‘All the credit is due to Captain Doren,’ said 
Vivian modestly; and the conversation lapsing 
into French, the gunner said he must return to 
his men. 
Before dawn next morning the troops stood to 
their arms and the infantry moved off towards 
Liége. The cavalry were standing to their horses, 
when a number of country-people were seen streaming 
across the fields towards them.
-P-A-G-E-88
  78 THE FIRST GLIMPSE OF GERMAN METHODS. 
Old men, women with bundles, and little children 
hanging on their skirts came straggling along. 
At once the cavalry were mounted and sent out 
to meet them. On seeing their own countrymen a 
pathetic wailing outcry arose, and some of the 
women, throwing themselves on the ground, wept 
bitterly. 
‘What has happened, my good people?’ asked 
Captain Doren kindly. 
Then the cries were redoubled, and a fearful tale 
of atrocity was told. An old man, his white hair 
dabbled with blood from a bullet-graze on his 
forehead, stood forth, and in solemn tones told a 
tale that brought tears into the eyes of the listening 
soldiers. 
At night, when the Germans were in possession of 
the town, some one had fired a pistol. That was the 
signal for the brutal soldiery to commence a massacre. 
They said they had been fired upon by the towns- 
people, broke into the houses, shot and bayoneted 
old men, women, and children without mercy, set 
fire to the houses, and in many instances forced the 
occupants into the flames with the points of their 
bayonets, laughing and jeering the while. 
On hearing this terrible tale the soldiers gave 
vent to cries of rage, and weapons were bared. 
‘Death to the Germans! Death to the murderers !’ 
they shouted. ‘Let us all swear to avenge these 
innocent victims;’ and Vivian and Oliver were 
amongst the most determined of the band. 
 
-P-A-G-E-89
  CHAPTER X. 
THE KAISER’S TIME-TABLE IS UPSET. 
HAT day, a hot and sultry one, the troops 
retired on Liége. The cavalry joined the field 
force, but Oliver and Vivian, in virtue of their 
appointment on General Leman’s staff, remained with 
him in Fort Fleron. j 
All day long the soldiers worked feverishly, trench- 
digging and erecting wire entanglements; for the 
Germans were expected every minute. But the 
hours passed, and the gray-green hordes did not 
appear. 
During the morning Vivian received a telegram 
from: England, after reading which he smiled con- 
tentedly. 
‘We’re joining in, Noll, he said. ‘Britain has 
determined to take her stand beside France and 
Russia. She will not see the neutrality of Belgium 
violated. My word, how the Germans will gnash 
their teeth when they know !’ 
‘When will they know ?’ asked Oliver. 
‘Tt seems that Britain has sent Berlin an ultimatum 
which expires at midnight. Germany cannot keep 
the news dark, and by to-morrow all the world will 
know it’s war between Germany and Great Britain. 
It’s the one thing the “ Boches,” as the Belgians 
call them, did not want. They thought we dared 
not move on account of our little political differences, 
But that is just where foreigners cannot understand 
us; we’re like a man and his wife who are always
-P-A-G-E-90
  80 THE KAISER’S TIME-TABLE IS UPSET. 
quarrelling, but woe’betide the third party who 
tries to take advantage of these little dissensions to 
interfere between them! He finds at once they close 
together like a pair of scissors; and I'll bet all I 
possess in the world that directly Great Britain 
knows it’s war, as one man English, Irish, Scots, and 
Welsh will stand shoulder to shoulder, as they did 
in the days of our grandfathers.’ 
‘I think Germany has made a great Blunger in 
invading Belgium.’ ‘ 
‘The very greatest; and, if I’m not snibtaldh, it 
will only be the first of a good many, and the more 
the merrier. You know what Napoleon said—“ It’s 
the General who makes fewest mistakes who wins the 
battle.” ” 
“Was it Napoleon ?’ 
‘Or Wellington, or some one. Anyway, it doesn’t 
matter. We’re one up to start with; and little 
Belgium is going to upset Kaiser Bill’s time-table, 
and if I know anything of German methods, any 
little hitch in their cast-iron, cut-and-dried plan will 
throw the whole machine out of gear.’ 
The news which Vivian had told Oliver was not 
then public property, and on all sides the question 
was being asked, ‘ Would Britain stand in? Would 
she send her superb fleet ? Would she land an ex- 
peditionary force ?’ It was known that King Albert 
had made a touching personal appeal to King George 
for help in his dire necessity ; and though Belgium 
was assured of Britain’s sympathy, she knew also 
that the ways of diplomacy are tortuous, and that 
the personal inclinations of monarchs, even those 
of the cymbal-clashing War Lord himself, were some- 
times overruled by obstinate politicians.

  The Belgians scrambled from their trenches,

-P-A-G-E-92

-P-A-G-E-93
THE KAISER’S TIME-TABLE IS UPSET. 81, 
Belgium realised that Britain had nothing to 
gain by fighting, and little to lose by standing out, 
except that which is dearer to a true Briton than 
his life—honour. Britain had pledged herself to 
maintain Belgian neutrality, but so had Germany. 
Germany had unblushingly and treacherously broken 
her word, had simply declared the treaty ‘a scrap of 
paper.’ Would Great Britain do the same? All 
Europe said, ‘No;’ and Europe was right. King 
George said, ‘No;’ the Government said, ‘No;’ and 
behind them the great British nation said, ‘No! 
no! no! Rather perish a hundred times than live 
dishonoured,’ And so Great Britain determined for 
war ! 
When midnight came and the news was telegraphed 
that Britain would fight for the freedom of Europe, 
mad, wild cheers rang out from the Belgian troops, 
and every man felt encouraged to defend his country 
to the last, and to die, if need be, a hero’s death. 
That night the utmost vigilance was observed. 
The trenches were manned, searchlights from the 
tops of the forts flashed round the country, and 
scouts sought for the Germans. 
Oliver and Vivian were in the trenches in front 
of Fleron on the morning of 5th August, the day 
after the capture of Visé, 
It was close and sultry, and very misty. As the 
sun dispelled the mists, the officers, from the tops of 
the forts, saw long lines of men advancing. Word 
was telephoned to the trenches, where every man 
was on the alert and burning to meet the foe, for 
during the previous night fresh tales of atrocities 
had been gathered by the scouts. 
Vivian and Oliver were standing on the top of 
KK ‘ F

  82 THE KAISER’S TIME-TABLE IS UPSET. 
their trench gazing through glasses, and soon dis- 
covered that the advancing troops were cavalry. 
They were moving on a very big front, farther than 
the eye could carry in either direction. 
‘That’s the one thing we have to dread in the 
Germans, Noll,’ said Vivian—‘their numbers. They 
will advance in hundreds of thousands and sacrifice 
life like water. The danger to us will be that they 
will swamp us with men, though we may kill a 
hundred to their one.’ 
The cavalry advanced rapidly, screening the 
artillery which behind them got into action and 
opened fire. The forts for some time maintained a 
dignified silence, until the Germans, coming closer 
and finding the range, began to drop their shells in 
the trenches. Then the forts opened fire, and a 
perfect inferno of noise reigned. The practice was 
splendid, and the great shells were seen bursting 
over the Germans, scattering death and destruction 
around. 
For an hour or two that went on, those in the 
trenches being fascinated spectators. 
‘It’s a bit annoying being stuck down here, 
though,’ grumbled Oliver. ‘I wish we’d remained 
in the fort; we could at least have helped with the 
guns.’ 
‘Keep calm, Noll,’ said Vivian, as he lit a cigarette ; 
‘our time -will come, and that soon, or I haven’t 
studied German manceuvres for nothing. This is 
what they call “the preparation for the attack,” 
and when they’re ready they ’ll come on in dense 
masses like sheep. With German thoroughness they 
will have worked out the whole thing. To the 
minute their infantry will advance, and according
-P-A-G-E-95
THE KAISER’S TIME-TABLE IS UPSET. 83 
to their theory we shall either be dead or we shall 
run away. If neither the one nor the other happens, 
the “Square-heads” will be so flabbergasted that 
they ’ll probably run themselves.’ 
Oliver could not help laughing. ‘I’ve noticed, 
when I’ve seen their troops drilling,’ he said, ‘that 
they move like machines, without rhyme or reason, 
and would crash into a wall unless ordered to halt.’ 
‘Precisely; the German soldier is a machine. 
Ever since 1870 two schools of officers have been 
fighting for predominance, the one for the smaller and 
more intelligent army—quality, we may say; the 
other for trained machines—quantity ; and in view 
of Germany’s increased population, the latter have 
won. The only concession the disciples of quality 
got was permission to cram three years’ training 
into two, at the cost of working the German soldiers 
like mules and making the majority of them loathe 
all things military in the first three months of their 
training.’ 
Presently the shells began to explode right over 
the trenches, and casualties occurred here and there. 
Then dense masses of infantry in close column, 
marching shoulder to shoulder, advanced upon the 
forts. 
“Now comes the tug of war, Oliver,’ said Vivian. 
‘We shall soon see whether results will justify the 
training of Potsdam.’ 
The guns from the forts thundered with renewed 
vigour, cutting avenues through the foe. As they 
came within range the Belgian infantry opened fire, 
and the leading ranks of the enemy seemed to waver, 
stagger, and then crumple up. Battalions, regiments, 
brigades, were swept away ; but as they fell writhing 
 
-P-A-G-E-96
  84 THE KAISER’S TIME-TABLE IS UPSET. 
to the ground, always fresh men, marching to time- 
table, advanced behind them, only to be in turn 
swept away. 
Heaps of dead began to accumulate; but in 
thousands, in tens of thousands, they came on, until 
gun and rifle fire could not sweep them down quickly 
enough. 
Oliver had long since taken the pouch and rifle 
of a fallen man and fired until the rifle got too hot 
to hold, but still the Germans, driven like sheep to 
the slaughter, came on in hordes. 
For two hours this continued, and then came a 
lull, occasioned by delay in sending forward the 
German reserves. 
There was little of the excitement of fighting 
amongst the Belgians; it was simply a case of 
firing and firing at dense masses of stolid infantry. 
‘It’s fearful work,’ said Oliver to Vivian as he 
wiped the perspiration from his face; ‘it seems like 
murder.’ 
‘And there must be more and much more of it,’ 
replied Vivian sternly, ‘before the arrogance and 
conceit are knocked out of bullying Prussia, Their 
military art is like their diplomacy—clumsy ; but we 
must kill without mercy, for if we don’t they ’ll kill 
us and tread all we hold dear under their heels.’ 
Supplies of ammunition were hurried up to the 
Belgian trenches, and soon fresh masses, advancing 
with greater determination than before, came towards 
them. Again guns and rifles roared and crackled ; 
Germans fell by the hundred; but their officers 
drove them relentlessly on, and, sheltered behind 
the masses of their dead, the enemy got closer and 
closer.
-P-A-G-E-97
  THE KAISER’S TIME-TABLE IS UPSET. 85 
As before, whole battalions were shot down; but 
ever behind them, marching stolidly forward shoulder 
to shoulder, came more and more, until at last, with 
a final rush, one regiment succeeded in gaining a 
footing on the slopes of Fort Fleron. Here the 
great guns could not be depressed sufficiently to 
reach them. Singing the everlasting ‘Deutschland 
tiber Alles,’ and shouting hoarse ‘hochs,’ they 
scrambled on as if they thought the walls would 
fall at their advance. 
‘Fools!’ said Vivian to Oliver, as they poured in 
a flanking fire; ‘have they forgotten the machine- 
guns?’ And at that moment from every embrasure 
the machine-guns screamed and rattled, and the 
enemy was literally swept away. 
In two minutes not a man was on his feet, while 
the slopes ran with blood. But even then, again 
and again they came forward, until the dead bodies 
were over a yard high, and the Belgians did not 
know whether to fire over or through them. This 
terrible barrier was of service to the Germans, who 
in countless hordes pressed on behind it until Bel- 
gian and German were firing at one another at fifty 
yards range. 
‘We must charge them,’ cried a Belgian captain, 
‘Fix bayonets, men, and keep a shot in your pieces 
for close quarters !’ 
‘Hurrah !’ cried Oliver, his blood fired at the idea 
of coming to close quarters; ‘hurrah, Vivian! Now 
we shall come to grips;’ and dropping his rifle, he 
drew his sword. Vivian did likewise. 
The enemy were then cutting the wire entangle- 
ments with nippers which they had in readiness; 
and the Belgians, with loud cries, scrambled from  
-P-A-G-E-98
ee eee 
86 THE KAISER’S TIME-TABLE IS UPSET. 
their trenches and formed behind their officers). No 
word of command was needed; lowering their 
bayonets, with a wild yell the little Belgians dashed 
forward. Then the Germans seemed to lose heart, 
as, firing from the hip, they advanced slowly, till 
with a crash the bayonets crossed. 
The Germans made a half-hearted defence, aad 
were stabbed and shot almost unresistingly, till at 
last, in panic, they turned and fled, pursued by the 
Belgians, who, dropping fresh clips of cartridges into 
their magazines, shot the flying ‘Boches’ down like 
rabbits. 
Warning bugles rang out, for the Belgians were 
pursuing beyond the range of the guns, and then 
they halted, flushed and elated. Having returned to 
their trenches, presently came yet another attack, 
and the men advanced in the same stolid fashion, 
only to be mown down as before; but their officers, 
from behind, pushed and beat them forward till 
again came the bayonet charge, with the same 
result. 
Yet a third time they came on; but this time, 
when they saw the levelled bayonets, hundreds flung 
down their arms and cried for mercy, while others 
literally squealed with fright, ‘for all the world like 
pigs,’ as Vivian afterwards said. After. that the 
attacks died down, and the German artillery again 
thundered out. 
That evening round the camp-fires the officers 
assembled to talk over the fight. 
Terence Dwyer, who had been busy all day with 
his guns, found Vivian and Oliver. He seemed a 
little glum, and, when rallied on it, he said, ‘Truth 
to tell, I thought we were in for a first-rate fight ;
-P-A-G-E-99
THE KAISER’S TIME-TABLE IS UPSET. 87 
but it’s more like murder, with little glory in kill- 
ing such fools as they are entirely. I wonder that 
rational beings can chuck away their lives in so 
senseless a fashion.’ 
‘That ’s just the point. . Are they rational beings?’ 
said Vivian. ‘I maintain that they ’re only trained 
machines, with about as much initiative. Donkeys 
or monkeys would behave as rationally.’ 
‘Faith, and it’s a true explanation that never 
struck me before,’ said Dwyer, as he walked away, 
meditatively sucking a big briar pipe.

  CHAPTER XL 
A DANGEROUS MISSION. 
HE Germans, however, did not by any means 
slacken in their efforts. During the night an 
attack was made, which was driven off with much 
loss; and at dawn, in greater numbers than before, 
the blundering Von Emmich hurled his devoted men 
at the forts. 
As the sun rose the heaps of dead and wounded 
were seen lying just where they had fallen or had 
managed to crawl, and the Belgians were touched 
with pity as they gazed upon the writhing, twisting 
heaps. 
But Germany has no feeling for the soldier who 
can fight no more. At the best the private is but 
‘cannon-fodder’ in the eyes of his superiors, and 
when he can no longer fight he can starve, or bleed 
to death, or linger in agony, unaided and uncared 
for. He is no longer of any use to the War Lord. 
And so the attack was continued with greater 
fury than on the day before. Germany was in a 
hurry, and could not wait; the War Lord had said 
his troops must march through Belgium, crushing and 
slaying all who dared to oppose them. France must 
be smashed before she had time to mobilise; days, 
hours—nay, even minutes were of value. If it cost 
a hundred thousand men, Germany must hack a way 
through. 
During the night the Ninth Army, the Iron 
Brandenburgers, the Kaiser's crack corps, had ar-
-P-A-G-E-101
A DANGEROUS MISSION. 89 
rived, and a hundred and twenty thousand men 
were hurled at the Belgians. : 
But Belgium, animated by patriotism, was as 
determined as Von Emmich. 
Germany must not pass. For the sake of country, 
home, and kindred, she should not pass! And so 
on the second day the carnage was more fearful than 
on the first, and on the third day it was even worse 
than before. At night the Germans, torn and 
shattered, were hurled back. Von Emmich’s three 
army corps, the picked men of the Kaiser’s hordes, 
were riven and blasted, and still the forts were 
intact, not a trench had been taken. 
During that day aeroplanes and a huge Zeppelin 
had added terrors to the attack, dropping bombs and 
directing the artillery fire, which had also grown 
fiercer; and great shells had fallen, which smashed 
everything they hit, and, when they fell, tore holes 
in the ground large enough to bury a transport- 
wagon in. But gallant little Belgium stood fast, 
and the Kaiser’s Huns were held at bay. 
On the third night all firing ceased and a dead 
calm reigned, a veritable calm of death, for between 
ten and twenty thousand Germans lay in the fields 
around untaken Liége. 
Spies brought in word that, to add to the 
Germans’ plight, they were starving, for their com- 
missariat had broken down. The time-table had 
not been kept to; three days had been lost; and 
the whole wicked plan, having met with an unex- 
pected difficulty, had been completely checked. 
Moreover, the reputation of Germany’s invinci- 
bility had gone for ever. Little Belgium, outnum- 
bered six to one, had met the boasting Prussians, 
 
-P-A-G-E-102
90 A DANGEROUS MISSION. 
and, despite their utmost efforts, had held them in 
check. No wonder that Belgium grew elated; but 
Vivian looked grave as he and Oliver ate their 
supper over their camp-fire that night. 
‘Von Emmich marched light,’ he explained: ‘ His 
orders evidently were to rush through Belgium, no 
opposition being expected. Their heavy artillery is 
not up yet; but when it arrives the forts cannot 
hold out, for if all I’ve heard is true, they have 
guns before which no walls can stand.’ 
While they were talking a sergeant came up to 
the fire, and, saluting, said that General Leman 
wanted to see the two English officers, Lieutenants 
Drummond and Hastings. Leaving their fire, they 
followed the sergeant behind the firing-line, where 
a car was waiting. Into this Oliver and Vivian 
jumped, when, the sergeant having taken the wheel, 
off they set for Liége. 
In half-an-hour they were in the presence of the 
General, who, with military directness, went straight 
to the point. 
‘Gentlemen,’ he said, ‘I want information badly, 
and it occurs to me that you two are the most 
likely to get it for me.’ 
“Command us in any way, General,’ replied Vivian. 
‘The enemy to-day have employed guns of a 
bigger calibre and range than any hitherto used. If 
they have many such, Liége cannot hope to hold out 
long. I want to know what these guns are, and, if 
possible, how many the Germans have. You both 
speak the language fluently, and could pass your- 
selves off as Germans better than any one else on 
my staff. Will you undertake this task for me ?’ 
Both at once agreed.
-P-A-G-E-103
Pe ee 
A DANGEROUS MISSION. 91 
‘TI leave the method of procedure entirely to you. 
Take anything in Liége that you want, and use my 
name in demanding it. I will give you a guide 
who knows the country for twenty miles round, and 
whom you may implicitly trust.’ 
‘Give us half-an-hour to mature a plan, General,’ 
said Vivian, ‘and I think we shall be ready.’ 
‘Good ; doas you like. You need not report to me 
again; go when you are ready, and God speed you.’ 
General Leman, a cold, unemotional man, rose 
and shook hands with the English youths, called 
the man who was to act as guide, and then reseated 
himself at the table, where he had been busy with 
maps and papers. 
‘This promises excitement,’ said Vivian. \ 
‘Thank goodness for it! Anything is weleome 
which will get us out of the trenches and away from 
the terrible sights there.’ 
‘Right you are; but let’s go in somewhere for 
ten minutes, and over a cup of coffee and a cigarette 
form our plans.’ 
The three went into a small restaurant pointed 
out by the guide. All those present rose and saluted 
the two officers, who bore on their persons manifest 
traces of their three days’ fighting. 
In twenty minutes their plan was settled, and 
they set to work. Two Belgian workmen’s suits 
were procured, bicycles, and a Browning automatic 
pistol each, with plenty of ammunition, They 
changed their clothes at the restaurant, and leaving 
their kit in the landlord’s charge, mounted their 
bicycles and rode off. 
_ Firing had again commenced, and every now and 
then the fiery track of a great shell could be seen in
-P-A-G-E-104

the sky. They chose a road leading towards Saine, 
between Forts Barchon and Evegnee. 
Riding without lights, they got along safely for 
a mile or two, until they reached a place where the 
German dead lay thick in the fields. They then 
dismounted, and, wheeling their machines, picked 
their way very carefully, some poor wounded wretch 
occasionally calling out to them for water, which 
they were, however, unable to give. 
‘Isn’t it horrible to think that these poor fellows 
are left here to die uncared for ?’ said Oliver. ‘It’s 
inhuman,’ 
‘It’s the German system of war,’ replied Vivian ; 
and they pursued their way till they came to a lane, 
where they again mounted and rode for some dis- 
tance. They went quite noiselessly, and got percep- 
tibly closer to the big gun, whose dull, booming 
sound they could distinctly hear. Every now and 
then they had to dismount and conceal themselves 
to avoid bodies of the enemy; and after one or two 
narrow escapes they climbed an ascent, at the top of 
which was a thick wood, where they hid themselves. 
They were then fairly close to the big gun, whose 
flash they could see. 
‘Hervé is below us,’ said the guide, ‘and it will 
be there that they have mounted this monster gun. 
Our best plan will be to lie quiet till sunrise, which 
will not be long, and then we can see what is going 
on.” 
Making themselves comfortable under some trees, 
they dozed till the sun was up, and then, creeping 
to the edge of the wood, Vivian and Oliver looked 
down on the town of Hervé, 
Through their glasses they at once found the
-P-A-G-E-105

great gun, which was standing on a massive em- 
placement. It was a terrific weapon, and was 
worked by a number of men dressed in white 
smocks. These loaded, and then retired to a dis- 
tance before the piece was fired, the noise of the 
report being appalling. 
For a long time Vivian gazed; then he said to 
Oliver, ‘It is as I thought. That is one of the 
huge 16 or 17 inch siege-guns that Krupps have 
manufactured, and which they imagine will stagger 
the world. Those fellows in the smocks are Krupps’ 
own men, for the manufacture of these gigantic 
weapons has been kept a secret, and none of the 
German artillery know how to handle them. In 
spite of all my attempts, I was never able to learn 
anything about them.’ 
It was more than seven miles as the crow flies to 
Liége, but the gun was able to drop enormous shells 
into the city with great accuracy. As they watched 
they saw a group of officers, distinguishable in their 
long coats, come up to the gun-emplacement and 
enter into conversation with the men. 
‘I'll wager a fiver that Von Emmich himself is 
among that crowd,’ said Vivian savagely. ‘If only 
we had a field-piece here, couldn’t we make them 
hop; and though it would cost us our lives, it would 
be worth it to drop a shell in their midst.’ 
Moving from where they then were, they per- 
ceived a crowd of soldiers at work on a second con- 
crete emplacement ; and presently they saw several 
great traction-engines, with wheels like steam-rollers, 
puffing along the road. For a long while Vivian 
observed them; then he handed the glasses to 
Oliver. 
   
-P-A-G-E-106
a sec lil Ba am aaa al a a Ae 
94 A DANGEROUS MISSION. 
‘By Jove,’ he said, ‘it’s another of those monsters! 
Look! the gun is in four pieces, and each piece is 
dragged by three traction-engines. A single one 
leads the way to test the road or to help to drag 
when needed.’ 
| Oliver saw all that Vivian described. 
‘The slowness in hauling them from the rail-head 
explains the delay in getting them into action,’ went 
on Vivian, ‘and it shows what a desperate hurry 
Von Emmich was in that he would not wait for 
them. He would have saved ten thousand German 
) lives had he done so.’ 
Having seen all they could, the three crept silently 
away, cycling through the woods towards Bolland. 
A mile farther on they saw yet another great gun 
being dragged into position, while swarms of soldiers 
were pouring along the roads. 
In spite of many a hairbreadth escape they at 
last reached Bolland, and then, thinking they had 
a clear road, they made for the Meuse. 
They thought they were out of danger, when they 
suddenly came upon a little party of infantry, men 
of the famous Prussian Guards. 
Instantly half-a-dozen rifles covered them, and 
a coarse-looking officer, riding up, called out to them 
at once to dismount and give an account of them- 
selves. They did so, and the guide explained that 
they were Belgian workmen on their way from | 
Charneuse to Liege. 
‘You ride good machines for workmen,’ sneered 
the officer. ‘You are, I doubt not, spies—Search 
them, men, for weapons; and if one of them has so 
much as a knife upon him, shoot the lot. Their 
bicycles will be useful to us.’
-P-A-G-E-107
  oe’ 
A DANGEROUS MISSION. 95 
While his men advanced to do his bidding the 
officer drew a revolver, with which he covered Oliver. 
The moment was one of fearful danger to all three, 
for their pistols would be discovered, and that meant 
instant death. 
Shouting ‘Mount and away!’ Vivian, with a 
movement quick as lightning, drew his Browning, 
and, as the officer fired, shot him dead. The 
Prussian’s bullet whistled by between Oliver and 
Vivian, and all three, pouring a dozen shots among 
the slow-moving Germans, stretched several of them 
on the ground; then, mounting, they dashed off. 
They were actually through the astonished soldiers 
before these could bring their rifles to their 
shoulders. A great hubbub arose, and the Guards- 
men sent a volley after the fugitives; but though 
their clothing was pierced, not one was. wounded, 
and every second put a greater distance between 
them. They had got quite out of range, when a 
man sprang from the bushes in front of them, and: 
levelling his rifle, fired. With a sharp cry the 
guide tumbled off his bicycle, and Oliver, drawing 
his pistol, fired three shots at the soldier, one of 
which brought him to the ground. He and Vivian 
then dismounted, and ran to the assistance of the 
guide; but it was of no use. He had been shot 
through the brain, and was already dead. 
‘Poor fellow! he has died for his country,’ said 
Vivian. ‘Now we must look after ourselves, 
Oliver.’ 
At top speed they pedalled off, and turning down 
a side-road, reached a wood, in which Vivian said 
it would be advisable to hide until they could assure 
themselves that the way was clear to proceed.
-P-A-G-E-108
  CHAPTER XIlL 
A PLOT THAT FAILED, 
F° fully an hour they lay hid; then, all being 
quiet, they crept from their place of conceal- 
ment, and walked some half-mile, till they came in 
sight of a road along which troops were pouring. 
Through their glasses they watched these for some 
time, till Vivian caught sight of a group sitting on 
the grass having their breakfast. This group was 
not more than half a mile away, and in the bright 
sunlight was exceedingly conspicuous. There were 
several officers, who were being waited on by a 
couple of soldier servants, and long Vivian gazed 
at them. Then he handed the glasses to Oliver, 
saying, ‘Observe that lot, Noll, and describe their 
uniforms and appearances to me.’ 
‘There are five,’ said Oliver presently. ‘Two are 
wearing the usual German field uniform; two have 
red breeches and dark-blue tunics, with red caps; 
and the fifth is in a pale-blue Hussar dress.’ 
‘Precisely,’ said Vivian ; ‘and what do you make 
of it?’ 
‘Seems strange; three of them are in uniforms I 
do not recognise as German.’ , 
‘And the reason is ‘very simple,’ said Vivian 
gravely ; ‘they are French wniforms !’ 
‘French uniforms in the German Army! How 
can that be ?’ 
‘Spies, my boy. That is another part of the 
German system. Spies, spies, spies everywhere; we & %
-P-A-G-E-109

must always be on our guard against them. Now 
let us get away to the other side of the wood and 
see if we can find a clear road.’ 
Fortune favoured them, and assisted by two 
young Belgians who were working in the fields, and 
who guided them to St Remy, they at last reached 
the Meuse, and crossing in a boat, by making a 
detour got round Herstal, and at last reached Liége. 
But on their way they made another and a 
startling discovery. The Germans had crossed the 
river in force at Visé, and were then attacking the 
forts Pontisse and Loincin, to the north of Lidge. 
‘They are closing in all round,’ said Vivian ; 
‘Liége is in a bad way. I fear we have but sorry 
news for General Leman.’ 
The General, however, received their news quite 
calmly, and thanked them for their information. 
‘I know already that the enemy have encircled 
us,’ he said, ‘and Fort de Flemalle is also attacked ; 
but I hope we shall be able to hold the forts till 
help from France arrives. The Field Army, how- 
ever, must retire on Brussels. Do not leave me, for 
I may again require your services.’ 
He then turned to several officers who were with 
him, and continued the conversation which the 
arrival of Oliver and Vivian had interrupted. 
‘It’s a pity we did not get a chance to tell him 
about those men in French uniforms with the 
Germans,’ said Oliver. 
‘Yes, it is; we must wait till we get another 
opportunity of speaking to him. At present we 
had better get back into uniform and return these 
machines.’ 
An hour sufficed for all that, and to have break- 
KK G 
 
-P-A-G-E-110
  98 A PLOT THAT FAILED, 
fast as well; then, feeling considerably refreshed 
they went out again to find the General. 
The German guns were bombarding furiously, 
and shells occasionally fell in Lidge, killing men, 
women, and children. For all that, the streets were 
crowded, and excited groups were discussing the 
news and the probability of the Germans taking the 
town. 
Oliver was walking along just behind Vivian, 
when, in a small square in front of the Hétel 
Helvetia, they came upon an excited crowd who 
were listening to a priest. This man was exhorting 
the townspeople, in case the Germans entered, not 
to resist, for if they did they would be shot, and 
their beautiful town destroyed. 
Many amongst the crowd resented this advice, 
and said that if the hated ‘Boches’ did succeed 
in entering Ligge they would resist, and would help 
their brothers and fathers who were serving in the 
army—a sentiment which was echoed by the women. 
Oliver, glancing over the crowd, saw a man bend 
forward and whisper to the priest. He caught only 
a momentary glance, but the man seemed familiar, 
more perhaps by reason of his figure and movement 
than his face, though his shifty eyes put him in 
mind of a person he had seen before. He walked a 
little distance deep in thought; then he pulled up 
with a jerk. 
‘By Jove! I remember,’ he cried, and started 
running back. 
‘What do you remember?’ asked Vivian, fol- 
lowing him. 
‘Your man, Loffel! He’s here,’ cried Oliver, 
and he made for the crowd.
-P-A-G-E-111
A PLOT THAT FAILED. 99 
Seeing two Belgian officers coming, one or two of 
the mob disappeared into a small side-street, and 
the priest left off speaking. 
‘I saw a man [I could almost swear was Loffel 
talking to this priest a minute ago,’ explained 
Oliver, looking round ; but there was then no such 
person in sight. 
‘It may be true,’ said Vivian. ‘That Loffel was 
a spy I know, and he may very well be in Liége ;’ 
and reaching the priest, they questioned him 
sharply. 
The man made sullen answers, and the crowd 
who had been listening to him, with their usual 
fickleness, began to mutter ‘Spy!’ and ‘Traitor !’ 
and to exhibit symptoms of unfriendliness; on 
which the man moved quickly off, followed by the 
mob. Léffel, however, if it had indeed been he, had 
completely disappeared; and, discussing the pro- 
bability, Oliver and Vivian went off again in search 
of General Leman. 
They hadn’t gone far when they came face to face 
with a group of Belgian officers, in the midst of 
whom were two officers in French uniform. 
‘By all that’s wonderful, Noll,’ cried Vivian, 
‘look at those Frenchmen!’ and Oliver saw that 
one was a big man in scarlet breeches and blue 
tunic, and the other a small man in light-blue 
Hussar dress. 
This had been exactly the case with the apparent 
Frenchmen they had seen an hour or so before 
amongst the Germans, and the same idea struck 
them both: they were spies! 
Amongst the Belgian officers who were with the 
Frenchmen was one of herculean -frame and build,
-P-A-G-E-112
  100 A PLOT THAT FAILED. 
Colonel Marchand, whom they had both met at 
Fort Fleron. He was walking in the rear, and 
going up to him, Vivian saluted, and asked if he 
could have a word in private with him. 
‘I am at your service,’ replied Colonel Marchand ; 
‘what can I do for you ?’ 
Vivian and Oliver then told him what they had 
seen, and expressed their opinion that these pre- 
tended French officers were nothing better than 
German spies. : 
At first Colonel Marchand was incredulous; then 
he hesitated, and said, ‘It might be, messieurs; they 
bring us rather unexpected news, as a matter of 
fact. They are asking to be led at once to General 
Leman, and say they are the advance guard of a 
French force coming to our relief. Two squadrons 
of cavalry are following close upon their heels.’ 
‘I should be wary, colonel,’ said Vivian; ‘ask 
for their papers.’ 
‘I will, and put the General on his guard, too, 
for his loss just now would be a national calamity.’ 
A mixed crowd was following the officers, and 
one fellow, particularly, was so persistent in trying 
to get close, as though to overhear what was 
passing between Vivian and Colonel Marchand, that 
Oliver pushed him away; on which the fellow 
scowled, and muttering something, dropped back 
amongst his companions, to whom he spoke in low 
tones. 
This was not lost on either Vivian or Colonel 
Marchand ; and when presently they met General 
Leman, just outside a large iron-foundry which he 
had been inspecting with a view to utilising it for 
defence in case the city was rushed, Colonel
-P-A-G-E-113
  A PLOT THAT FAILED. 101 
Marchand advanced alone, and spoke a few words 
to him privately. 
Quite unmoved, the General turned to the French 
officers and listened to their tale of rapidly advancing 
French forces. 
‘They will indeed be welcome,’ said the General, 
‘for we have a hard job before us,’ 
He then inquired the names and ranks of the two 
officers, and how it was they had been enabled to 
outdistance their squadron ; to all of which questions 
the so-called French officers gave glib and plausible 
answers. Meanwhile the crowd pressed round, and 
the officer in Hussar uniform said, ‘I bear the com- 
pliments of General D’Aumade, and he says that if 
you would ride out and meet the troops it would 
be a high compliment to France.’ 
‘Ah, and did he write to that effect, monsieur ?’ 
‘No; he simply sent a message.’ 
‘H’m! By the way, have you any papers by 
which I may satisfy myself that you are really 
what you seem ?’ 
‘General,’ said the taller man with great asperity, 
‘do you question the veracity of a French officer ?’ 
‘By no means, sir,’ replied the General ; ‘ but you 
will not mind my making sure that you are indeed 
a French officer, You may be a German, you 
know, and I must put you under arrest until 
I make sure.—Colonel Marchand, request these 
gentlemen’s swords,’ 
On hearing these words the Hussar officer turned 
very pale; then, muttering something to his com- 
sane he drew a revolver. 
‘Quick, General!’ cried the herculean Colonel 
Marchand, and taking General Leman in his arms,
-P-A-G-E-114
  102 A PLOT THAT FAILED. 
he lifted him bodily and dropped him over the 
wall by which they were standing. The Hussar 
fired, and crying out, ‘Spies! traitors!’ the gallant 
colonel fell. 
Immediately Oliver and Vivian drew their auto- 
matic pistols, which they had fortunately kept, and 
levelling them at the pseudo-Frenchmen, cried out 
to them to surrender. Several of the crowd, how- 
ever, rushed forward and tried to rescue them; 
whereupon, without waiting to ask questions, the 
two English youths opened fire. One or two of the 
other Belgian officers, drawing their swords, drove 
off the crowd, who were mostly spies in the pay of 
Germany, and then attacking the two pretended 
Frenchmen, secured them both, but not before the 
Hussar had shot a young lieutenant. 
General Leman, annoyed at being literally ‘lifted ’ 
out of danger, came running back, and in a few 
minutes ‘the whole affair was over, and the two 
pretended Frenchmen and several of the rioters 
were marched off under a strong guard to prison. 
Doctors had at once come to Colonel Marchand’s 
assistance, but that gallant officer was dead, shot 
through the heart; and when the crowd learnt the 
news, loud and bitter was the ery for vengeance on 
the German murderers, for no one doubted they 
were Germans in disguise. 
It at once occurred to Oliver and Vivian that 
the plot was of a more far-reaching nature than 
appeared on the surface. Who were those French 
soldiers coming in that the German spies had 
spoken of ? 
They made their way to the General, and told 
him all they knew. Immediately steps were taken,
-P-A-G-E-115
A PLOT THAT FAILED. 108 
and then Vivian and Oliver, with some other officers, 
rode out to the gate, through which the French 
cavalry were to enter. They had not long to wait, 
for a Lancer came galloping in with the news that a 
squadron of French Dragoons was then advancing 
towards Liége. Oliver and Vivian were sent off to 
welcome them, and to lead them to the market- 
place. 
Half a mile from the town they came up with 
the dusty troop. They were quite French to look at, 
wearing brass helmets with drooping black plumes 
hanging down their backs, red breeches, and all. 
The officer in command spoke perfect French, and 
chatting freely with Vivian, he entered Liége at the 
head of his men. Passing through the narrow 
streets, they came suddenly into the market-place, 
where a guard of honour was drawn up to receive 
them. The officers saluted, and the troopers carried 
swords. Just as they had all got into the square, 
acompany of Grenadiers wheeled round behind 
them and entirely cut off their retreat; a sharp 
command rang out, and five hundred rifles, with a 
dozen machine-guns, were trained upon them. 
‘What does this mean?’ asked the officer in 
command, haughtily. 
‘It means that if you and every man of you do 
not surrender and lay down your arms at once, you 
will be blown to pieces,’ said Vivian coolly, and 
drawing his pistol, he covered the captain, Oliver 
doing the same by the lieutenant. 
At the same time the soldiers closed in on them, 
and it was clear to all that the game was up. 
The Dragoons were dismounted and disarmed. 
In two minutes it was proved that the majority 
 
-P-A-G-E-116
104. A PLOT THAT FAILED. 
of the men were German non-commissioned officers, 
many of whom could speak only a few words of 
French. 
They were marched off with celerity amidst 
the execration of those of the townspeople who 
witnessed the scene. 
In ten minutes all was ready for the reception of 
the second squadron, and Oliver and Vivian went 
out, as before, to meet them, This second lot looked 
exactly the same as the first squadron had, and the 
officer in command spoke equally good French. 
Leaving two other Belgian officers talking to the 
officer in command, Oliver and Vivian rode on to 
the rear of the squadron, when, to the former’s 
surprise, about half-way along he recognised Lieu- 
tenant Dous, also in French disguise. Pulling the 
peak of his lance-cap well down over his eyes, 
Oliver got by undiscovered, and was just telling 
Vivian of the discovery he had made, when a 
window above them was opened and a man thrust 
out his head. 
‘Treachery! Take care; you are betrayed!’ he 
bawled in German; and looking up, both Oliver 
and Vivian saw that the man was Léffel. 
By that time the head of the column was almost 
in the market-place. 
‘Look out for squalls,’ cried Oliver as the men 
unslung their carbines, while the officers drew their 
revolvers, 
Dous, giving one rapid glance round and seeing 
the ruse was discovered, turned his horse’s head and 
spurred off down a side-street. 
‘Don’t let him escape!’ shouted Oliver; and he 
and Vivian, dashing by the nonplussed Uhlans—for
-P-A-G-E-117
  
A PLOT THAT FAILED, 105 
Uhlans they were—went galloping in pursuit, a 
German firing at them as they passed him. 
That shot seemed the signal for a fusillade, and 
the trapped Germans opened fire indiscriminately on 
men, women, and children. 
Oliver and Vivian, however, were galloping after 
Dous, who had a minute’s start of them. They saw 
him turn out of the street, and followed him down 
another just as crashing volleys broke out behind 
them. They were gaining on him, when a field 
battery, swinging out of a square, wheeled into the 
street between them and Dous, completely blocking 
the road. 
‘Out of the way; let us pass!’ cried Oliver. 
But the officer in command, riding up, said in 
English, ‘Hallo, you fellows! what’s the racket ? 
Come on with us. My orders were, on hearing 
musketry, to come into action at once in the 
market-place.’ 
The officer was Captain Dwyer. 
‘That man just gone by—he’s a spy!’ shouted 
Vivian. ‘Draw your guns on one side and let us 
pass.’ 
He and Oliver rode on to the pavement, but they 
had to proceed at a walking-pace, for crowds of 
excited townspeople blocked the way. By the time 
they had cleared the guns and the people Dous had 
completely disappeared, and it was plain that, so far 
as they were concerned, all chance of overtaking 
him was lost. They went for some distance, but 
saw no more of him; and, bitterly disappointed, 
Oliver led the way back to the market-place, whence 
the rattle of musketry and the booming of cannon 
and machine-guns were heard. When they reached 
 
-P-A-G-E-118

106 A PLOT THAT FAILED. 
the market-place a terrible sight met their gaze, 
Not one of those treacherous Uhlans was left; all 
were either dead, or prisoners surrounded by Belgian 
soldiers. It was not a nice sight, and Oliver and 
Vivian rode away. 
‘It will give the “Boches” a lesson,’ said 
Vivian; ‘those who break the rules of war must 
not be surprised if they are “hoist with their own 
petard.”’ 
The two tried to identify the house from which 
Léffel had shouted his warning, the only effect of 
which had been to cause his countrymen to be slain 
instead of captured; but he too had disappeared, 
and no information could be gained about him. 
‘The whole place is a nest of spies,’ said Vivian, 
‘and Liége has as much to fear from spies within 
as foes without.’ 
The two pretended French officers were at once 
tried by a military tribunal, and on them were 
found papers showing they were both German 
officers. Their plan had evidently been to capture 
General Leman, and, by getting their cavalry into 
the heart of Liége, to seize a number of important 
townspeople, and make their safety the price of the 
inhabitants giving up the town. Once again German 
craftiness had blundered, and another treacherous 
plan had miscarried. 
The officers were condemned to be shot, and at 
sunset, outside the town, met the fate they deserved. 
It was a significant fact that the bombardment of 
the town, which had ceased during the time the 
pretended French cavalry were inside, was renewed 
with increased violence within half-an-hour of the 
second squadron being destroyed—which proved in 
 
-P-A-G-E-119
A PLOT THAT FAILED. 107 
what close touch the spies in the town were with 
the German enemy. 
Soon after midday General Leman sent for Oliver 
and Vivian, and thanked them warmly for the 
valuable information they had brought. ‘You 
certainly saved my life,’ he said, ‘which I value 
only so far as I can be of service to my country ; 
and, what is of far more importance, you have for 
the time saved a catastrophe to our arms, for which 
I shall certainly commend you to the king. It 
is clear, however, that we cannot hold the city; 
preparations must be made at once for the field 
troops to retire on the main army, and I want you 
to take my orders to the brigade commanders. 
Wait upon me again in an hour from now.’ 
Saluting, the English lads went to find a place 
in which to dine, and in the street they ran up 
against their new friend, Captain Doren, who with 
his regiment was to form the rear-guard. 
During the day the field troops were called in, 
and the infantry and guns started for the main 
army. 
Before the cavalry left Litge a great uproar 
arose, and it was found that a strong body of 
German cavalry and horse-artillery had entered the 
town and taken possession of it. The Belgian field 
troops having been withdrawn, the Germans had 
got through between the forts, and so captured the 
city. As the last of the Belgian forces left Litge 
there was some skirmishing with the enemy, but 
they got out all right, and the Germans did not 
attempt to pursue, 
‘It makes me real mad to have to leave the city 
to those brutes,’ said Oliver savagely. ‘I tremble
-P-A-G-E-120
108 A PLOT THAT FAILED. 
to think what the fate of the poor townspeople 
will be.’ 
‘It’s only a minor move in the game,’ replied 
Vivian. ‘In any case, the German rush has been 
stopped for three days, and that’s a thing the 
“Square-heads” never dreamt of. If Namur and 
Antwerp can hold out as long, I wouldn’t be in 
Von Emmich’s shoes when he meets his Imperial 
master. I fancy the War Lord will hardly com- 
pliment him.’ 
‘It is an extraordinary position,’ continued Oliver, 
‘a city in the hands of the enemy, surrounded by 
forts still holding out. The Belgians can surely 
turn their guns on Liége and blow the Germans to 
pieces.’ 
‘And incidentally the town and their own country- 
men and women. That’s where the Germans have 
got them. It’s a sharp move, and the Germans in 
Liége are for the moment masters of the situation.’ 
Oliver bit his lips savagely, for he saw Vivian 
spoke only the truth, and in silence they rode on. 
As it had been easy for the Germans to pass 
between the Belgian forts during the darkness, it 
was equally easy for the Belgians to avoid the 
Germans attacking the western forts, and daybreak 
found them safely at their destination.
-P-A-G-E-121
  CHAPTER XIItl 
THE HUNS PRESS ON. 
HE next few days were busy ones. Oliver and 
Vivian, with the regiment to which they were 
attached, were in the rear-guard, and frequent were 
the skirmishes with the German troops who were 
pouring into Belgium in hordes. 
The German cavalry, if possible, outdid the in- 
fantry in ruthlessness, and terrible scenes were 
witnessed by the retiring Belgians. 
‘To think that these Vandals assert that they 
are the’ most civilised people of Europe!’ said Oliver 
to Vivian. ‘They are worse than Red Indians.’ 
‘All part of the German theory of striking terror 
into the inhabitants,’ replied Vivian. ‘The only 
result of it will be to arouse such a hatred against 
the invaders that, when they retire, may the Lord 
help any who fall into Belgian hands !’ 
News reached Belgium that Britain was sending 
across an army, and, as Englishmen, Oliver and 
Vivian were constantly asked, ‘When will your 
brave countrymen arrive?’ ‘When are the English 
coming?’ or ‘Where are the French?’ to none of 
which questions could they give any answer. 
At Diest the Belgians attempted a stand. Every 
road was barricaded with lines of barrels and 
bushes; earthen entrenchments were thrown up, 
behind which companies of infantry lay hidden. 
Field artillery was placed in advantageous positions ;
-P-A-G-E-122
  110 THE HUNS PRESS ON. 
and Captain Dwyer, being well in front, was in 
high spirits. 
About eleven o’clock in the morning dense masses 
of German cavalry approached, and were allowed 
to get within a thousand yards before the Belgian 
artillery opened fire. Then Captain Dwyer, as he 
afterwards related to Oliver and Vivian, ‘let rip, 
and created tremendous havoc. The German guns, 
coming up, quickly unlimbered, and a hot duel 
commenced. 
Again the Germans attempted a mad rush, and 
the cavalry charged right up to the barricades, 
which they attempted to tear down; but the con- 
cealed infantry rained lead upon them, and at last 
the assailants were compelled to retire, leaving 
three-fifths of their force behind. Then came a 
novel attempt. The Germans raced up armoured 
motor-cars, carrying light guns, and these blazed 
away till Captain Dwyer, with several beautifully 
placed shots, smashed up: half-a-dozen ; whereupon 
the rest retired. Later came the turn of Oliver and 
Vivian, and with the cavalry they made a dashing 
charge which entirely checked the German advance 
for that day. 
Still it was impossible to stop such overwhelming 
numbers, but the Belgians fought delaying actions 
wherever it was possible, and every day’s march of 
the Huns was paid for with hundreds of lives. 
“Good news, boys!’ cried Captain Dwyer one 
night, coming up to the fire round which Oliver, 
and Vivian were sitting. ‘The French are at 
Charleroi, whence they are advancing upon Wavre.’ 
‘Hurrah !’ cried Oliver. ‘Now perhaps we shall 
be able to meet the Germans on more equal terms.’
-P-A-G-E-123
          THE HUNS PRESS ON. 111 
‘If we can only check them till our fellows arrive 
from England, the “ Square-heads ” may get their fill 
early in the campaign.’ 
But German reinforcements were continually 
pouring in, and a strong army corps drove itself 
like a wedge between the French and Belgian 
armies, so that the retreat was continued to Louvain. 
This town, so dear to every Belgian heart, could 
not be held, and to save it from destruction the 
army halted beyond it. Every one now knows 
how mistaken was the Belgian idea, and how the 
Germans, with a ruthlessness that will be a blot 
upon them so long as they are a nation, massacred 
hundreds of the defenceless inhabitants, and destroyed 
the town with its world-renowned and priceless 
library. 
So the Belgians retired on Brussels, and with 
feverish haste began digging trenches, erecting 
barbed-wire entanglements, and preparing for a 
stubborn defence. 
Refugees from the surrounding country poured in 
by the thousand; but the Belgians did not lose 
heart, and were ready to sacrifice everything to 
save their capital, when, on the evening of the 
17th, notices were posted in the town to the effect 
that any attempt to hold it would only ensure its 
ultimate destruction, and that, in the street-fighting 
that must arise, the townspeople would have to 
suffer all the horrors that resistance entailed. And 
so the army again fell back towards Antwerp; and 
on the 19th a fresh German army corps which had 
just arrived from Germany, in new uniforms, with 
flags flying and bands playing, entered and took 
possession of the town, giving the townspeople an
-P-A-G-E-124
  112 THE HUNS PRESS ON. 
exhibition of their ridiculous ‘ goose-step,’ in order 
to impress upon them the invincibility of the German 
army. Of the tens of thousands of lives it had cost 
them to get thus far, and of the fortnight that they 
were behind scheduled time, not even a whisper was 
heard.

CHAPTER XIV. 
AN EXAMPLE OF ‘KULTUR.’ 
*QOYS,’ said Captain Dwyer the next afternoon 
to a little group of British officers serving 
with the Belgian Army, amongst whom were Oliver 
and Vivian—‘ boys, what’s going to happen when 
we get to Antwerp ?’ 
‘We shall be bottled up there until the French 
or British arrive, or until the Germans take the 
town,’ replied Vivian. 
‘Then the fun of the campaign is over for a time, 
and we’re likely to have a spell of idleness—which 
isn’t exactly what I came to Belgium for.’ 
‘There won’t be much idleness until the campaign 
is over,’ said Vivian; ‘the Germans are not the ones 
to let the grass grow under their feet.’ 
‘And how long do you think the war will last, 
Mr Wiseacre?’ asked young Hewson of the 10th 
Hussars, who was serving with the cavalry. 
‘At least a year; perhaps two, perhaps three.’ 
‘That settles it, then,’ said the impulsive Dwyer. 
‘Settles what ?’ asked Oliver. 
‘My promotion.’ 
‘How ?’ 
‘Why, if the war lasts that time, it will mean 
long casualty lists; they mean promotion, and all 
of us before the war is over will be majors, 
lieutenant-colonels, or—goners ;’ and he pointed his 
finger significantly downwards. 
KK. H  
-P-A-G-E-126
  114 AN EXAMPLE OF ‘KULTUR.’ 
‘Why should the war last so long?’ asked 
Hewson. 
‘Simply because nobody is ready but the Germans,’ 
replied Vivian. 
‘But the French Army is already in the field; 
the British are coming.’ 
‘Some French troops are in the field, but the full 
strength of France will not be ready for six weeks. 
As to Great Britain, what are her hundred thousand ? 
A sop! a sacrifice! Poor fellows, they will be 
thrown to the lions to keep them at bay until Britain 
has trained the two or three millions which will be 
required. Even then it may not be enough; there 
are always complications to be feared. Germany 
will stir up strife all over the world; she will stop 
at nothing to attain her ends. If she can’t come 
out on top, she will try to ruin the world. We 
have got to hold Germany in check until our two 
million men are trained; until France and Russia 
are ready to stand shoulder to shoulder with us. 
Then we must all strike together, and utterly smash 
her !’ 
‘Is Germany really so powerful ?’ asked Captain 
Spencer, a fair-haired, long-limbed Life-Guardsman. 
‘She is a nation in arms. Ready, prepared, 
highly trained, implacable, unscrupulous, merciless ; 
that is the conclusion I have come to after studying 
the nation for three years.’ 
‘And what says our young friend Hastings ?’ 
asked Dwyer. 
‘I am afraid Vivian is right. From what I have 
seen of Germany, I quite agree with him.’ 
‘Well, then, boys, every man will be wanted, 
and our place is with our own army. What are
-P-A-G-E-127
  AN EXAMPLE OF ‘ KULTUR.’ 115 
you going to do when we reach Antwerp, Drum- 
mond ?’ 
‘Get across to England, and return with the 
Expeditionary Force.’ 
‘Hands up, all who mean to see this thing 
through in the field, cried Dwyer. 
Instantly every hand went up. 
‘Then, boys, I’ve an illigant idea. If we go 
home it will mean pints of ink, miles of red tape, 
and re-postings, and re-appointings; farewells with 
one’s relations, which are worse ordeals than facing 
a bayonet charge; and perhaps—think of it, ye 
gods !—being shunted to the depot or on the recruit- 
ing staff. Imagine what a loss to the country a 
lot of fire-eaters like us would be if they bottled 
us up at home. Here we are now, and here let us 
stay, say I.’ 
‘But you have just said you didn’t want to be 
bottled up in Antwerp.’ 
“No more I do, my lad. My idea is to resign 
our appointments here, and then strike out to meet 
the French Army, which we know is at Charleroi, 
and to remain with it until the British arrive.’ 
‘On my word, Terence,’ said M‘Laren, who be- 
longed to Dwyer’s own battery, ‘you’ve really got 
a good idea for once.—What do you all say to it ?’ 
The suggestion was received with favour, and 
that very afternoon was put into.execution. 
The matter was referred to the king himself, who 
sent for the British officers, and after thanking them 
most heartily for the services they had rendered, 
and regretting that they were leaving him, said he 
quite sympathised with their wish to be with their 
own countrymen, and gave them free permission to  
-P-A-G-E-128
  116 AN EXAMPLE OF ‘ KULTUR.’ 
depart. He shook hands with them all, and said 
they were to draw on the quartermaster-general for 
anything that they might require on their journey. 
Thus it came about that, on the following morn- 
ing, seventeen British officers, all well mounted and 
armed, set out from the Belgian camp, being 
escorted by Captain Doren, other officers, and a 
number of their men, and cheered to the echo when 
at last they were free of the Belgian lines. 
‘Now, boys,’ said Captain Dwyer, ‘discipline and 
red tape are the soul of the British Army, and we 
are now a British Expedition on our own. We 
must have a leader.’ 
Captain Dwyer, being senior by length of service, 
was unanimously elected commander, and Vivian, as 
being most at home on the Continent, second in 
command, That being settled, riding in twos, they 
trotted off. 
It was decided to pass between Termonde and 
Malines, skirt Brussels, cross the field of Waterloo, 
and then go through Nivelles to Charleroi. 
As they passed Termonde the sound of heavy 
firing was heard, and through their glasses they 
saw smoke and flames rising from the doomed 
town. 
‘I believe the Germans are destroying the place,’ 
cried Dwyer; ‘and to think we have to watch, and 
_ are powerless to stop it!’ 
‘The Huns are sowing the wind now; later they 
will have to reap the whirlwind,’ said Vivian. 
‘And the sooner the better, snapped Oliver 
savagely. 
At any rate it was highly impolitie to approach 
any closer, especially as parties of cavalry were
-P-A-G-E-129
AN EXAMPLE OF ‘ KULTUR.’ delay 
harrying the country all round. So the little band 
swept to the east, and after having narrowly 
escaped detection on one or two occasions, passed 
safely through between Brussels and Louvain. 
Riding hard, they crossed the historic field of 
Waterloo, which called up recollections of their 
country’s glory, and pressing on, reached a thick 
wood situated between Wavre and Gembloux. Here 
they decided to off-saddle and dine, and, with the 
light-heartedness of British soldiers, their dangers 
were forgotten, and they laughed and chatted as 
if on autumn manceuvres at home. They even 
ventured to light a fire, getting dry wood, so that 
there was very little smoke. 
‘T tell you what it is, you fellows, said Hewson 
of the Hussars; ‘a dozen boiled eggs are what we 
want to complete our feast. I caught sight of a 
farmhouse about half a mile away, and I’m going 
_ back to try my luck. I’ve got some money, and I 
dare say the poor wretches will be glad to get hold 
of it.’ 
‘I never knew such a fellow for eggs in my life 
as Hewson,’ said Spencer. ‘He ought to leave the 
service, marry, and take to poultry-farming.’ 
‘I haven't had an egg since we left Ligge, any- 
way, retorted Hewson with a laugh, ‘and I mean 
having some to-day or dying in the attempt.’ 
Away he went; and the others, chatting and 
laughing, forgot all about him till almost an hour 
had passed, when Vivian suddenly cried, ‘ By Jove! 
what’s happened to Hewson? He ought to have 
been back long ago.’ 
Instantly all were serious, and Vivian and Oliver 
at once started in search of their companion.
-P-A-G-E-130
118 AN EXAMPLE OF ‘KULTUR.’ 
‘I know the farmhouse,’ said Vivian; ‘Hewson 
pointed it out to me as we came along.’ 
Keeping in the shadow of the trees, Oliver and 
Vivian went a little way longer round than the road 
would have been, until they presently saw the house 
standing in its orchard. Oliver was advancing 
straight towards it, when suddenly a trumpet rang 
out, and Vivian, seizing his companion by the arm, 
pulled him back. 
Watching with straining eyes, they saw a number 
of German Hussars coming out from the house; and 
these, fetching their horses from a cowshed, mounted 
and formed up. Presently two appeared leading a 
man between them, who, Oliver and Vivian at once 
saw, was Hewson. His arms were bound behind 
his back and a rope was round his neck. On seeing 
this Oliver would have rushed to their friend’s 
assistance, but Vivian again restrained him. 
‘We should imperil all our lives that way,’ he 
said. ‘Wait; let’s see which way they are going.’ 
They went off along the road, and Vivian counted 
forty odd sabres. Sadly they rejoined their com- 
panions and related what they had seen. All were 
grieved at the sad occurrence, and were determined 
to attempt a rescue. A short council of war was 
held, and while the younger and hotter-headed ones 
were for mounting and dashing after the Germans, 
the older and cooler ones were for more cautious 
measures. 
‘We'll track them,’ said Dwyer ; ‘they are in all © 
probability an outpost, and will picket somewhere 
for the night. A surprise attack is far more likely 
to prove successful than a mad rush.’ 
The evening was drawing on as they started, and 
 
-P-A-G-E-131
AN EXAMPLE OF ‘ KULTUR.’ 119 
following in the direction in which the Germans 
had gone, they rode for several miles. From a 
solitary Belgian farm-hand whom they met they 
learnt that a party of Germans, with a prisoner, had 
passed him about an hour before, he having hid while 
they went by. It was then almost dark, and the 
British officers were advancing at a walk, when 
Vivian, who had been some hundred yards ahead as 
an advance-guard, came trotting back to say that a 
little body of cavalry was coming towards them. 
‘How many ?’ cried half-a-dozen voices. 
‘Not more than a dozen.’ 
‘Then, by the powers! we'll charge ‘em,’ said 
Dwyer. ‘Quick; separate into two bodies, and 
hide on each side of the road, among the trees.’ 
In one minute this was done, it being arranged 
that when Dwyer led his men out on one side, 
Vivian should do the same on the other. 
In less than three minutes a party of cavalry, 
who in the failing light it was easy to see were 
Germans, came in sight, riding with feet out of 
stirrups and singing their everlasting ‘Deutschland 
iiber Alles.’ Letting them get past, Dwyer led his 
men out at a gallop from one side, and Vivian from 
the other. There was a shouting, a reeling shock ; 
then the British swords rose and fell like clockwork. 
In two minutes all was over, a number of riderless 
horses stampeded, and twelve Germans, among them 
an officer, lay in the road, dead or sorely wounded. 
The British casualties were a few flesh-wounds only. 
‘The Kaiser is twelve Huns the less,’ said Dwyer 
grimly, and he and his companions returned their 
swords to their scabbards. 
They were about to remount, when they saw a 
 
-P-A-G-E-132
120 AN EXAMPLE OF ‘KULTUR.’ 
man running madly towards them. On seeing them 
he drew a knife and rushed at them. He was 
clearly a Belgian peasant, and Oliver and several 
more cried out to him in French that they were 
friends, and would not harm him; but the man 
came on, and would certainly have done some 
damage had not Captain Dwyer caught him in his 
arms and held him. The others then crowded 
round and assured him he was amongst friends, 
when he answered in the Walloon dialect. 
It was at first difficult to understand his dis- 
jointed ravings; but seeing that no harm was 
offered him, he grew calmer, and little by little 
they learnt his tale. 
His village was some two miles farther on, he 
said. During the afternoon some Uhlans had come 
into the town, and had laid hands on everything 
they could seize, They took the village priest and 
the schoolmaster, whom they held as _ hostages, 
saying they would at once be shot did any one dare 
to raise hand against the soldiers. They then 
entered the houses and demanded food and drink. 
The officers of the Uhlans had gone into the house 
of this man, whose name was Gautier, and eggs, 
milk, and chickens were placed before them. 
Eating everything in the house, they demanded 
wine; and on the man’s son saying they had none, 
he was instantly struck to the ground. 
Gautier’s two nieces, who lived with them, were 
compelled to wait on the officers, who drank huge 
quantities of beer. 
Later on some Hussars, with a captured officer as 
prisoner, entered the village, and their officers joined 
the Uhlans. More food had to be procured; and
-P-A-G-E-133
  AN EXAMPLE OF ‘KULTUR.’ 121 
then one of the officers offered an insult to Gautier’s 
niece, who, it appeared, was betrothed to his son. 
The young man, beside himself with rage, struck 
the villain to the ground; on which the other 
officers fell upon him with their swords and bar- 
barously murdered him. The niece, interfering to 
save her lover, was shot dead by the officer whom 
Gautier’s son had knocked down. A regular riot 
ensued, and a cry arose, ‘The villagers are rising !’ 
whereupon the soldiers fired upon all they could 
see. Gautier managed to escape, and, mad with 
fear and rage, was running down the road, when he 
met the little body of British officers as related. 
Gautier’s story—only one of scores—roused every 
Briton amongst them to fury. The man was 
questioned as to the prisoner, but could give no 
information, except that his captors had worn a 
skull and crossbones on their busbies. 
‘The Death’s Head Hussars, the Crown Prince’s 
regiment,’ said Vivian. ‘The men who captured 
Hewson belonged to that regiment too; it’s he, 
I’m sure.’ 
The dead and wounded Germans lying in the 
road belonged to the same regiment, and Gautier, 
in furious tones, said they wore the same uniform 
as those in his village. 
Various plans for effecting Hewson’s rescue were 
discussed, when Vivian said, ‘ We are but a handful, 
and, though British, we cannot successfully engage 
six times our number. I have a plan. I can pass 
for a German anywhere. I'll put on that dead 
officer’s busby and cloak, and penetrate into the 
village. I'll learn what their disposition is, and 
get the lie of the land. Then in the dead of night  
-P-A-G-E-134
122 AN EXAMPLE OF ‘KULTUR.’ 
we'll steal in and try to rescue Hewson. This is 
a case in which the craft of Ulysses will serve us 
better than the strength of Hector.’ 
‘T’ll come too,’ said Oliver. 
‘Right you are,’ agreed Vivian; and stripping 
the dead officer and a trooper, in a quarter of an 
hour, in their cloaks and busbies, and wearing their 
swords, the two adventurers were ready. The 
whole party then moved off, guided by Gautier to a 
spot some distance from where they then were, and 
a mile or more to the west of the village. It being 
now night, Oliver and Vivian, accompanied by 
Gautier as guide, departed. 
‘And if you don’t return in two hours, by the 
shades of all the Dwyers, I'll charge in and avenge 
you!’ said the gallant Irishman. 
‘And we'll follow Dwyer,’ said the others, as, 
with a handshake all round, Oliver and Vivian 
departed.
-P-A-G-E-135
CHAPTER XV. 
SWIFT RETRIBUTION, 
ITHOUT accident the three reached the village, 
which they boldly entered, Gautier keeping 
behind, as to have been seen walking with the 
supposed Germans would at once have aroused 
suspicion. 
They passed several soldiers, who, seeing Vivian's 
uniform, clicked their heels and saluted. 
Sounds of revelry were heard on all sides, and 
it was clear many of the men were drunk. A 
house was in flames, and a crowd of soldiers came 
surging down the main street. They were coming 
straight for Oliver and Vivian, when Gautier, 
approaching quickly from behind, and plucking 
each by the sleeve, pulled them into an empty 
house almost opposite the burning one. 
In the light cast by the flames it was seen that 
the soldiers were. dragging along some dozen men 
and boys, all bound with ropes. Among them was 
an old white-haired priest with a rope round his 
neck, He stumbled ; whereupon a brute struck him 
with the butt of his rifle. A sort of gasp escaped 
from Oliver, watching from the window of the 
house. : 
A dark-moustached Uhlan officer seemed to be 
in command, and in an instant Oliver recognised 
Dous. He whispered the news to Vivian. 
‘He seems forward in every devilry; but, please 
God, this night we’ll settle accounts with him.’ 
 
-P-A-G-E-136
124 SWIFT RETRIBUTION. 
The prisoners were dragged or driven along till 
they reached the open space in front of the burning 
house. Here they were stood up, and Dous gave 
an order; on which the soldiers started loading 
their rifles, 
‘They cannot mean murdering these poor 
wretches,’ cried Oliver in horrified tones. But such 
was indeed the case. Seeing what was the inten- 
tion of the soldiers, a woman, with a little boy 
hanging to her skirt, came screaming from a house, 
and throwing herself at Dous’s feet, begged appa- 
rently for the life of one of the men. 
Dous laughed in her face and turned away, and 
when she again supplicated him he spurned her 
with his foot. Meanwhile the soldiers made ready 
to fire, when, just as they were going to pull trigger, 
the woman, with a wild cry, rushed up to one of 
the prisoners, and threw her arms round him as 
though she would protect him from the bullets. A 
couple of soldiers went forward to tear her away, 
but she clung all the more desperately. 
“Waste no more time; shoot her with the other 
cattle,’ Dous cried out; on which the half-drunken 
soldiers raised their rifles and sent in several 
volleys. 
Bayonets and rifle-butts finished the fearful 
business, but neither Oliver nor Vivian dared gaze 
upon the scene. When they again looked out all 
the victims were dead, even to the poor little boy, 
who had been bayoneted. 
“My God!’ groaned Oliver; ‘and these fiendish 
deeds are performed by men who pretend to be 
civilised! Let us out upon them, Vivian, and slay 
till we are killed.’
-P-A-G-E-137
SWIFT RETRIBUTION. 125 
‘Wait,’ said Vivian sternly; ‘brute beasts that 
they are, their turn has not yet come.’ 
Gautier, whose eyes burned in his pale face like 
living coals, had never taken his gaze from the 
fearful sight; but his lips were drawn back from 
his teeth, and it would be bad for any German who 
fell into his power. 
After the massacre one of the soldiers was seen 
throwing small balls, filled with some incendiary 
matter, into the houses, several of which burst into 
flames. Others had rolled casks of beer into the 
street, and a disgusting orgy commenced. 
The street outside the house in which Oliver and 
Vivian were concealed was lit up so vividly by the 
light of the burning houses that it was not safe 
to venture out, and Vivian grew alarmed about 
Hewson. An anxious hour passed, for at any 
moment some drunken soldiers might have entered. 
If they had, their fate would have been sudden, 
for not one of the three would have hesitated a 
moment about taking the life of such dastardly 
ruffians. 
At last most of the soldiers dropped off into a 
drunken slumber, and Oliver, Vivian, and Gautier 
left the house and passed through the village. 
Vivian’s uniform, to the one or two soldiers awake, 
was a magic passport, and none questioned them. 
Nothing, however, could be} learnt of Hewson ; and, 
disappointed, they set out on their return. Gautier 
guided them, and they had almost reached the spot, 
when suddenly a hoarse voice challenged them in 
French. 
‘Halte lu! Qui vive?’ and the click of the bolt 
of a rifle being drawn back was heard. 
 
-P-A-G-E-138
  126 SWIFT RETRIBUTION. 
The trio at once stopped, and Vivian answered 
that they were friends and English. 
‘Stand!’ replied the sentry; and, to their 
surprise, a soldier in brass helmet and blue tunic 
advanced, Unmistakably he was a French officer, 
and Vivian was wondering what on earth had 
happened, when Captain Dwyer’s voice was heard 
trying to explain in his laboured French that it was 
all right, and that these were the two officers he 
had spoken of. 
Full of surprise, Oliver and Vivian followed 
Dwyer to the rest of their companions, when they 
saw a number of French cavalrymen standing about, 
while two officers were talking with the Englishmen. 
Explanations followed, and a strange tale it was. 
It appeared that while Dwyer and the rest were 
anxiously and impatiently awaiting the return of 
Oliver and Vivian, they had heard cavalry moving 
through the wood. Believing that they were 
Germans, Dwyer had so disposed his men as to give 
the intruders a hot reception. Fortunately, before 
any harm had been done, an officer named Russell 
had noticed the distinctive French brass helmet and 
long horsehair plume. Still, remembering the trick 
the Germans had played at Liége, he was unconvinced 
until, hearing some suspicious sound, the lieutenant in 
command had ealled to his men to halt, and several 
others had asked in French what was the matter, 
while a non-commissioned officer ordered the men 
to unsling their carbines. Feeling convinced then 
that these were really French cavalry, Russell had 
called to the lieutenant—whose name, it afterwards 
turned out, was Durand—to halt, saying that he 
was an Englishman, till lately serving with the
-P-A-G-E-139
  SWIFT RETRIBUTION. 127 
Belgian army. After a few cautious preliminaries 
on each side, the Englishmen and Frenchmen were 
both convinced that the others were really what 
they seemed, and then warm greetings passed 
between them, 
The Frenchmen had no very good news to tell. 
It appeared that they were part of the army pushed 
on to Charleroi in order to check the German 
advance. The day before, a party of German 
Hussars, pretending to be English, had boldly ridden 
into Charleroi, but being discovered, had been at~- 
tacked and routed, leaving half their number dead 
behind. 
The next day the Germans had advanced in 
overwhelming numbers, and a fierce engagement 
took place. Lieutenant Durand, with his regiment, 
the 7th Cuirassiers, had been thrown forward to 
check the enemy, but had been severely handled by 
the German artillery and cavalry, and cut off from 
the main body. Some had surrendered; but the 
more valiant among them, led by one or two fiery 
young officers, among whom was Durand, had 
managed to cut their way through, and had escaped, 
with the intention of finding their way back to 
their own lines at night. Losing their way, how- 
ever, they had wandered about, having had one or 
two brushes with small parties of Germans, until 
they lost all idea of their whereabouts, and ulti- 
mately met with Dwyer and his companions. 
Oliver and Vivian then told their tale, and ex- 
clamations of rage and fury broke from their 
listeners at the recital. One of the French officers 
spoke English, and for the benefit of his country- 
men translated the gist of the conversation, 
Si 
   
-P-A-G-E-140
  128 SWIFT RETRIBUTION. 
No sooner was the tale finished than a short 
discussion took place as to what they should do, 
In,two minutes everything was decided. 
‘We must attack and punish them,’ said Dwyer, 
‘no matter what the odds. Did we sneak away 
and allow such cowardly butchers to escape scot- 
free, we should be unworthy the name of men.’ 
: The Frenchmen, with their usual impulsiveness, 
were even more emphatic than the British. 
British and French, they were more than fifty 
sabfes, and it was decided that, guided by Gautier, 
they should make for the village on foot. The 
horses were to be left at a safe distance, under the 
charge of two French ‘soldiers who were slightly 
wounded. The rest were then to enter the village 
and attack with the cold steel every German they 
met, while Gautier aroused the villagers, who would 
turn out and assist the Allies. The rest would be 
mostly a matter of chance; the only certain thing 
being that if the Allies were defeated, a round 
hundred at least of the cruel Germans would go 
before them. 
At once the march was begun, and the outskirts 
of the village were reached. All was then quiet, 
but the red glow from the partly burnt houses still 
lit up the main street, at the end of which were 
two sentries, marching to and fro with the usual 
stiff, clockwork motion of the Prussians. 
Keeping as far as possible in the shadows, four 
men, among whom were Captain Dwyer and Gautier, 
crept towards the sentries. Suddenly there was a 
rush, a short struggle, and two Germans had paid 
the penalty of their crimes, The little party then 
boldly entered the village, and had got half-way along
-P-A-G-E-141
SWIFT RETRIBUTION. 129 
the main street, when they came face to face with 
another sentry. This man uttered a loud cry and 
fired, dropping a Frenchman. In an instant he 
was pierced by half-a-dozen swords. Then from 
the houses the Germans, thinking the villagers had 
risen, came pouring out. Swords and revolvers 
went to work, and no mercy was shown. The 
Germans were killed whenever met. ‘The villagers, 
warned by Gautier, rushed into the street, and, 
armed with hammers, axes, iron bars, anything they 
could seize, joined in the fight. The very women 
and boys, infuriated against the murderers, came to 
the men’s assistance, and picking up the weapons 
of the dead Germans, turned them against the foe. 
Many of the valiant Teutons, paralysed with fear 
and thinking a big enemy force was on them, 
refused to leave the houses, and when the soldiers 
broke in, threw themselves on their knees and 
screamed for mercy. They got the same mercy 
they had shown the unoffending Belgians. 
After the first rush had cleared the main street, 
Oliver, Vivian, Gautier, and one or two others made 
for Gautier’s house, in which were the officers. 
These had turned out at the first alarm, and 
hastily saddling their own horses, mounted. Just 
as the search-party came to the house they started 
galloping off for safety. 
Oliver recognised Dous, and fired, as did several 
others. Two officers were killed, and the rest 
galloped away; but, a number of villagers blocking 
the end of the street, they reined in, and the 
British again came up with them. Vivian, striking 
upwards, passed his sword through a fat Hussar 
captain, killing him on the spot; two others met a

-P-A-G-E-142
    130 SWIFT RETRIBUTION. 
similar fate; and Oliver was just going to fire at 
a young lieutenant of Hussars, when he threw up 
his arms, and, with a piteous cry, said, ‘Mercy! 
Spare me! I had nothing to do with killing the 
villagers.’ 
‘Dismount and hand over your arms,’ cried 
Oliver; and the officer, quite a youth, but with a 
pale, dissipated face, did so. 
Oliver was about to hand him over to a French 
soldier to guard, when Gautier, with a hoarse ery, 
rushed up armed with an axe, and would have 
brained the man had not Oliver prevented him. 
“Tis he; ’tis the villain who murdered my niece !’ 
shrieked Gautier. 
The German literally screamed for merey, denying 
what Gautier said. 
‘Secure him,’ said Vivian sternly ; ‘he shall be 
fairly tried.’ 
In half-an-hour all was over, and every German 
who had been in that village had either escaped or 
lay dead, the great majority being dead. Vengeance 
had indeed overtaken them. 
Dous had once more escaped, as had another 
mounted officer; but they had received a lesson 
which would cause them to pause ere they com- 
mitted further atrocities. 
The houses being searched, Gautier, to his huge 
delight, found his two — sons bound with 
ropes, but unhurt. 
Hewson was also found tied up, and explained 
how he entered the farmhouse to ask for eggs, only 
to walk into a group of Germans, who promptly 
made him prisoner, one fellow wanting to shoot 
him. He had been very badly treated, and was
-P-A-G-E-143
SWIFT RETRIBUTION. 1381 
told he would be hanged in the morning before the 
troops left the village. 
Dwyer, Hewson, Vivian, and two French officers 
formed themselves into a court-martial, and the 
trembling Hussar lieutenant was brought before 
them. Damning evidence of his guilt was brought 
forward, and on his face was the mark of the fist 
of Gautier’s son. He was condemned to be hanged, 
and was told the sentence would be carried out in 
an hour. 
The villagers were then advised to leave at once 
and spread themselves about in the neighbouring 
villages, as the Germans, when the main body 
arrived, would be sure to take a terrible vengeance 
on any found there. An exodus at once began, 
men, women, and children, with carts, perambu- 
lators, and hand-barrows, on which they had col- 
lected their few articles of value, streaming away. 
By daybreak the village was cleared, and the 
German lieutenant, still begging for mercy, was taken 
out and hanged over the branch of a tree. That 
act of justice performed, the little troop buried in a 
common grave one Englishman and four Frenchmen 
who had unfortunately been slain, and then striking 
westwards, continued its march.

‘1r’s A LONG WAY TO TIPPERARY.’ 
  LL were glad to leave behind the village of 
Maives, for such Gautier said was its name. 
The place presented a terrible sight, ‘a regular 
shambles,’ as Russell said. 
During the night Oliver and Vivian had con- 
tinued to wear their German greatcoats, but the sun 
getting hot, Vivian suggested throwing the garments 
away. As he was about to do so, chancing to put 
his hand in the pocket, he found a bulky envelope 
addressed to General von Kluck. Instantly the 
envelope was opened, and for some minutes he read 
eagerly. 
‘By Jove, you fellows,’ he exclaimed, ‘here’s 
news that’s worth a whole division! These de- 
spatches say that the French were utterly defeated 
at Charleroi yesterday, and are in full retreat; that 
a British army is marching towards the Sambre- 
and that Von Kluck, with three army corps and 
two cavalry divisions, is to march with all speed 
against it and crush it in front, while two other 
army corps, after pressing back the French, are to 
fall on its flank.’ 
The English-speaking Frenchman, on hearing this 
news, grew very red in the face, then talked rapidly 
with his comrades, who would not believe that their 
countrymen had been so badly defeated. 
‘What’s this? An Imperial order?’ continued 
Vivian, and opening another paper, he read to 
 
-P-A-G-E-145
  ‘1T’s A LONG WAY TO TIPPERARY.’ 183 
himself. Then he flushed for a moment, eventually 
laughing and handing it to Oliver. 
‘Of all the dashed cheek!’ cried Oliver. ‘Why 
—why—it’s monstrous !’ 
‘Here, I say, you fellows, what is it?’ cried 
Dwyer, Hewson, and others, crowding round. 
‘“What’s the joke? Confound this beastly German ! 
Translate it.’ 
‘Listen,’ said Vivian. ‘This charming document 
is a copy of an army order issued by the Kaiser, 
dated 19th August. It runs something like this: 
“Tt is my Royal and Imperial command that you 
concentrate your energies, for the immediate present, 
upon one single purpose, and that is that you address 
all your skill and all the valour of my soldiers to 
exterminate first the treacherous English, and walk 
over General French’s contemptible little army.” ’ 
Violent remarks uncomplimentary to his illustrious 
Majesty burst from the listeners. 
‘Bombastie ass,’ said Spencer of the Life Guards ; 
‘he’s been so fed up by those around him with the 
idea of his invincibility that he quite believes it. 
It will tax all his Generals’ skill to exterminate us.’ 
‘If all his Generals have as much skill as Von 
Emmich they ’ll be considerably taxed,’ said Hewson. 
‘I wonder whether Kaiser Bill has forgotten 
Blenheim, Waterloo, Balaclava, Delhi, or Ladysmith,’ 
said Dwyer. ‘But we must be off. We must not 
rest till we have found the British Army, told them 
our news, and taken our places with the “boys.” 
Then let the Germans come on!’ 
French and English mounted, and, travelling with 
caution, set off. It was a long and dangerous ride, 
and many a narrow escape they had. Near Bascoup

134 ‘It’s A LONG WAY TO TIPPERARY.’ 
they were almost discovered, but were warned in 
time by some Belgian refugees who were flying 
before the advancing Germans. 
These Belgians had bad news. The Lidge forts 
had been captured, they said, and General Leman, 
found desperately wounded in one of the forts, was 
a prisoner. Namur, bombarded by the great German 
guns, had surrendered after making all the resist- 
ance possible, and the victorious Germans were over- 
running the whole country. 
Though every one of the party was extremely 
anxious to press on and warn the British of their 
danger, they had to remain in hiding till dark; and 
then they went on again, guided by a Belgian and 
travelling rather by guess, as they had no idea 
where the British were. 
' At length, thoroughly weary, they reached a 
farmhouse a few miles from Binche, and were 
hospitably received by the farmer. The horses 
were fed and watered, and they were given food. 
About midnight, thoroughly fatigued, they lay down 
in a small spinney near the house, for the night was 
terribly hot. They set sentries to guard against 
surprise, and in ten minutes all except the sentries 
were sound asleep. The officers took their turn of 
keeping guard with the men, and about an hour before 
dawn Oliver was aroused by Vivian to take his spell. 
The poor lad was terribly tired, and after march- 
ing round the little group three or four times and 
seeing all was quiet and safe, he yielded to tempta- 
tion, and sat down with his back against a tree to 
rest just as the gray of the sky was turning to pink. 
It was Sunday morning, and the weather was very — 
hot and close. Oliver’s mind went back to his
-P-A-G-E-147
® 
‘7r’s A LONG WAY TO TIPPERARY.’ 1385 
home in dear Old England, and he thought how in 
a few hours the church bells would be summoning 
the congregation to assemble ,and worship. The 
organ would peal out, and sweet hymns be wafted 
on the summer air, and—Oliver’s head fell forward 
and he dropped asleep. Asleep on his post, one of 
the gravest* crimes a soldier can be guilty of in 
times of war! But he was very young and very 
tired, and, though he had seen fighting, was as yet 
but little experienced in the real duties of a soldier. 
His dreams were of anthems in churches, then of 
a swinging marching chorus on the operatic stage, 
till with a jerk he awoke, to find the sun up. He 
started to his feet, horrified to think he had so far 
forgotten his duty, but relieved to find that no harm 
had happened through his negligence. Then he 
paused and wondered if he were still dreaming, for 
the sounds of voices singing fell upon his ears. He 
shook himself and listened again. No, he was not 
mistaken ; voices, surely English voices, and not far 
off either, were singing a rollicking chorus. 
He ran in the direction whence came the sounds, 
the road that led along in front of the farmhouse, 
and as he ran came unmistakably the sound of 
English voices singing : 
‘It’s a long way to Tipperary, 
It’s a long way to go; 
It’s a long way to Tipperary, 
To the sweetest girl I know.’ 
Then followed some words amongst which Oliver 
could distinguish only ‘Piccadilly’ and ‘ Leicester 
Square,’ till again rolled out: 
‘It’s a long, long way to Tipperary, 
But my heart’s right there.’
-P-A-G-E-148
136 ‘it’s A LONG WAY TO TIPPERARY.’ 
For a moment Oliver was thoroughly puzzled ; 
then nearer still came the sound of voices : 
‘It’s a long way to Tipperary ’—— 
Oliver waited for no more. Forgetting all military 
caution, he ran forward, and in a minute saw a 
squadron of cavalry riding along the road. British 
cavalry in the familiar khaki, riding with that ease 
that distinguishes our horsemen! ‘There they were, 
our bronzed, clean-shaven lads, with laughing eyes, 
showing their splendid teeth as they sang. Caps 
on the backs of their heads, tunics unbuttoned at 
the throat, a happy, careless, merry lot, they rode 
along, trolling their song. The tune was common- 
place, the words rubbish, but it was the sweetest 
music Oliver had ever heard. He gave one wild 
hurrah, then raced back, almost shook Vivian’s arm 
off, and shouted at the top of his voice, ‘Hi, you 
fellows, get up; our chaps are here! Listen to 
’em !’ 
In another minute he and Vivian, with several 
others at their heels, were running towards the road, 
and, excitedly waving their caps, they burst upon 
the astonished gaze of the troopers. 
But there was nothing of the excitability of Con- 
tinental troops about our men; they just gazed at 
these foreigners—for all the new-comers were in 
Belgian uniforms—and waited to see what was 
going to happen. No weapon was drawn, and 
many did not leave off singing. The officer in com- 
mand took the cigarette from his mouth, flicked off 
the ash, and advancing alone towards Oliver and 
his companions, looked at, them with a tolerant 
smile.
-P-A-G-E-149
‘1r’s A LONG WAY TO TIPPERARY.’ 137 
‘Hurrah!’ shouted Dwyer. ‘By the powers, 
ye’re a sight for sore eyes! The top o’ the mornin’ 
to every man-Jack of ye. Shake hands, sir, though 
I don’t know ye; but I’m Captain Dwyer of the 
Horse-Artillery ;’ and he went up to the officer. 
‘You ’re certainly a Briton, in spite of your rig,’ 
said the officer, as he shook hands, ‘And who are 
these ?’ 
‘Britons all, and of the best.’ 
But some Frenchmen having followed their Eng- 
lish companions, it was high time to explain matters, 
and constituting himself spokesman, Dwyer told 
Captain Travers who they were and how they hap- 
pened to be there. 
Captain Travers, who was personally known to 
one or two of the officers, listened with great interest 
to the story of their adventures. 
‘You’re a lucky lot of beggars to have been in 
the thick of the Belgian fighting, and to have been 
the first to shake up Prussian egotism,’ said he. 
‘Please God we may get our turn next.’ 
‘You will, captain, and that sooner, perhaps, than 
you expect. Do you know that five army corps 
and two cavalry divisions are pressing on at top 
speed to crush you ?’ 
‘Five army corps!’ said Captain Travers incredu- 
lously. ‘Why, our cavalry and aircraft have dis- 
covered only two, and those yet a day’s march off. 
Even those two must be careful, for they will march 
with their left flank exposed to attack by the 
French at Charleroi.’ 
‘The French at Charleroi are defeated and in full 
retreat,’ said Vivian; ‘these gentlemen ’—pointing 
to the French officers—‘were in the early part of
-P-A-G-E-150
  138 ‘IT’s A LONG WAY TO TIPPERARY.’ 
the fight. Our fellows have all seen the advancing 
Germans, and I have important despatches, captured 
from a German officer, proving what I say.’ 
‘Great Scott! this is stirring news. Let’s have 
a palaver.’ 
‘First would you mind telling us where our army 
is, and in what force, and how you happen to be 
here ?’ asked Captain Dwyer. 
‘I'll tell you just what’s common knowledge,’ 
smiled Captain Travers. 
He bade his lieutenant dismount the men for five 
minutes; then he stepped aside with the English 
officers, who heard from him the first news of the 
British Expeditionary Force. 
_The very day after the clbiential to Germany had 
expired, the British Army had started mobilising. 
Everything had worked like clockwork. Reservists 
had been called to their regiments, clothes and equip- 
ments issued, and the men concentrated at their 
various centres. Within a week the Expeditionary. 
Force was ready to start for France. 
The railways had at once been taken over by 
Government, the first Army Service Corps unit leav- 
ing for the lines of communication on the initial day 
of mobilisation. The British Navy convoyed: the 
army across the Channel, and the Expeditionary 
Force landed without a single accident at Boulogne, 
Havre, and other points. 
The British soldiers were received with the wildest 
enthusiasm by the French, and their rest-camps were 
literally besieged by swarms of admirers. 
The Commander-in-Chief was Field-Marshal Sir 
John French, and with him were such fine soldiers 
as Sir Douglas Haig, Sir H. Smith Dorrien, Major- 
 
-P-A-G-E-151
‘7r’s A LONG WAY TO TIPPERARY.’ 139 
General Hamilton, Brigadier-Generals Gough, Chet- 
wode, Count Gleichen, and others. 
From the rest-camps the army had entrained, and 
from different. points had marched to a position north 
of the Sambre, which had been assigned to them by 
General Joffre. 
The French Commander-in-Chief had been pour- 
ing troops into Belgium since 15th August, and the 
British hoped that their offensive would be success- . 
ful; the tidings that Vivian and his companions ‘ 
brought of the total defeat of the French at Char- 
leroi and their subsequent retreat was news to 
Captain Travers, 
The bulk of the British Army was in a position 
extending from Conde to Mons, some twelve miles 
away, in happy ignorance of the retreat of the 
French and the proximity of the Germans. 
The 2nd Dragoons, 12th Lancers, and 20th Hussars, 
forming the 5th Cavalry Brigade under General 
Chetwode, were at Binche; and Captain Travers 
had left there an hour before on a reconnaissance. 
‘The best thing we can do is to get off to General 
Chetwode and report as quickly as we can,’ said 
Dwyer; and the rest being of the same opinion, 
Captain Travers detailed a corporal and a couple of 
men to act as escort for them, saying he would go 
forward a mile or so on the lookout for the enemy’s 
cavalry. 
When the British troops learnt that there was a 
possibility of their meeting the Germans they gave a 
perfect yell of delight, and one ruddy-faced youngster, 
turning to his comrades and asking, ‘Are we down- 
hearted ?’ was replied to with such a thunderous 
‘No!’ that the Frenchmen who did not understand
-P-A-G-E-152
140 ‘1r’s A LONG WAY TO TIPPERARY.’ 
English tightened their grip on their reins, and 
looked as if they expected every moment those 
‘eccentric sons of Albion’ to charge in amongst 
them. ; 
But the broad grins on the faces of the troopers 
convinced them that there was no danger of an 
unexpected attack, and so they grinned in harmony. 
With their escort Vivian and the rest set off, 
and in less than an hour were at the Brigade head- 
quarters. 
They were eyed with considerable interest by the 
British troopers and officers, who wondered what 
news the little body of Belgian and French soldiers 
brought, and whence they had come, till Dwyer, 
catching sight of a young subaltern of Lancers, cried 
out, ‘By the powers, it’s me own cousin! Teddy, 
your regiment ’s in luck to get out so soon.’ 
‘Terence !’ said the youngster—‘ why, I thought 
you were some Belgian swell. What on earth is 
the meaning of this, and where have you been this 
last month or so ?’ 
Terence Dwyer tipped his young cousin a pro- 
digious wink. ‘All in good time, me boy;’ and 
the news flying round that these Belgian-uniformed 
officers were British, they were soon surrounded by 
a curious crowd, who plied them with questions 
faster than they could answer. 
One of General Chetwode’s aides-de-camp, learn- 
ing what the commotion was about, at once led 
Vivian, Oliver, and Dwyer to the General, when the 
three gave their names, and Vivian handed over the 
despatches he had taken. The General betrayed no 
emotion while reading them, and when he had 
finished he turned with a smile to his visitors.
-P-A-G-E-153
‘1r’s A LONG WAY TO TIPPERARY.’ 141 
‘We shall see our friend the enemy sooner than 
we expected, it appears,’ he said. 
«Yes, sir. 
‘Well, they will find us not unwilling to meet 
them; we shall be able to put our various theories 
to the test. Can you supplement the news contained 
in these letters in any way ?’ 
Vivian and Dwyer briefly related what they had 
seen, and the General listened intently. 
‘Five army corps,’ he said. ‘It’s a tough pro- 
position; but I dare say the Commander-in-Chief 
will be able to deal with it. JI shall have to ask 
you, Mr Drummond, to go on at once to General 
French, and take these letters with you. I will 
write a few words to go with them.’ 
‘I would much rather stay and see how the 
Germans meet our men, sir,’ said Vivian. , 
‘And I’ ‘And I, echoed Dwyer and Oliver ; 
but the General held up one hand. “ 
“On no account, gentlemen. I have no one here 
but my own men, and I do not know how the 
Commander-in-Chief will view the news. I shall 
send the whole of you to him under escort, and he 
must decide.’ 
It only required one look at the General’s firm 
mouth to show that he meant what he said, and 
that it would be no use trying to argue, even if a 
regimental officer ever dreamt of doing such a thing 
with so august a person as a General. So, putting 
the best face they could on the matter, they saluted, 
and retired to await the General’s despatch. 
In ten minutes’ time he himself came towards a 
group of them, and Dwyer introduced the officers, 
some of whom, however, the General had known in 
 
-P-A-G-E-154
142 ‘Ir’s A LONG WAY TO TIPPERARY.’ 
England. He shook hands with them all, and with 
the French officers, passed his cigarette-case round, 
and informed them that the escort was ready. 
‘Tell General French,’ he said, ‘that I will main- 
tain touch with the enemy, and will keep him well 
informed of my movements;’ and in another five 
minutes the little party of adventurers were on their 
way to the base. 
‘It’s a beastly shame being bundled back like 
this, grumbled Dwyer; ‘we might at least have 
been allowed to stop and see the fun,’ 
Vivian smiled pleasantly. ‘The fun will last,’ he 
said. ‘And what a splendid fellow General Chet- 
wode is! Ready to face five army corps with one 
brigade of cavalry, and as unconcerned about it as 
though it was an ordinary field-day.’ 
‘A sight less so than my old chief, General 
Cavendish, used to be on a field-day,’ laughed 
Spencer. ‘When I was on his staff he used to have 
an attack of nerves for a week before a field-day, 
and was in a regular fever all the day for fear he 
should commit some blunder. His aides used to 
delight in galloping up to him with alarming reports, 
and I’ve seen the old boy almost ready to fall off 
his horse with sheer funk. I’ve often had to turn 
my back on him and have a jolly good laugh.’ 
‘Well, I hope he hasn’t got a command here,’ said 
Dwyer. 
‘No fear; he’s resigned himself to half-pay and 
the gout long ago, and takes his consolation in tell- 
ing every military man that “the service has gone 
to the dogs, sir—absolutely to the dogs.” ’ 
‘I know the type,’ said Vivian; ‘they passed 
away with the régime of the old Duke of Cambridge, 
   
-P-A-G-E-155
  ‘ir’s A LONG WAY TO TIPPERARY.’ 143 
and made way for the men of to-day, who will prove 
to the world that they are second to none.’ 
Oliver said nothing, but reflected that these same 
old Generals had also proved on many a hard-fought 
field that, if not perhaps so- full of theory as the 
younger generation, they were dour and _ hardy 
fighters. 
It was a twelve-mile trot to Mons, where the 
British headquarters were, and as they rode along 
they saw aeroplanes swooping about overhead, only 
one of the signs that the warfare of to-day is a 
very different thing from the warfare of our fathers’ 
days.
-P-A-G-E-156
  CRAPTER XVI. 
THE BATTLE OF MONS, 
¢ B’ Jove, Vivian, it does my heart good to be 
amongst our own bonny lads again!’ cried 
Oliver with fervour. ‘Their English look, the 
browns ahd tawnies of their close-cropped nobs, put 
me in mind of home.’ 
‘Yes, the Belgians are a plucky little race, but 
Continental soldiers lack the happy-go-lucky, confi- 
dent air of our chaps. I’ll guarantee there’s not a 
single man amongst the whole crowd who would 
admit even the possibility of defeat.’ 
The party had reached Mons, and were amongst 
the British troops. Sawnie and Pat and ’Arry were 
chatting and chaffing and laughing together; all 
was good humour and calm confidence. A. handful 
of Britons were going to face the Kaiser’s hordes. 
Many would fall, but that was their business; they 
were soldiers, and their hearts were in their task ; 
their country expected great things of them, and their 
country should not be disappointed. In the camp 
parlance, ‘Were they down-hearted?’ No, not by 
a very long way; they were as merry as a lot of 
schoolboys out for a holiday. 
News had already been flashed in that the 
British outposts were’ engaged with the enemy, 
and trenches were being hastily dug, cover prepared, 
houses loopholed, and standing crops cleared away. 
All the work was being done in a cheery, light- 
hearted way ; and although the men knew that soon
-P-A-G-E-157
  THE BATTLE OF MONS. 145 
each one might be battling for his life, no one ob- 
serving them at work would have guessed it. 
Vivian and Oliver, with the rest, had little time 
to look around them, for they had to go on to 
headquarters; and presently they found themselves 
before the unpretentious house in which the British 
Commander-in-Chief had taken up his quarters. The 
news of their arrival had been telephoned from 
Binche, and General French was expecting them. 
He came into the garden to meet them, a compact, 
strongly built man, in plain khaki, as was every one 
else, only the double row of ribbons on his tunic 
marking him out from his staff. 
Oliver looked with keen interest at the strong, 
thoughtful face, with the kindly gray eyes, and he 
felt, as did all the others—to many of whom, of 
course, Sir John was well known—that Britain 
might rely with confidence upon the man to whom 
she had given the command of her troops. 
He received them all gravely, read the captured 
despatches, then questioned Oliver, Vivian, and 
Dwyer, and the French officers, as to the strength 
and disposition of the enemy. 
He thanked them for the valuable information 
they had brought, and then, turning to a couple of his 
staff, told them to take the names of all the officers 
present, and report them as ‘returned to duty.’ 
The Frenchmen were invited to stay as guests, 
and their comfort was to be looked after. 
All the British at once asked to be employed, 
which request was granted, and they were told by 
the Commander-in-Chief to remain for the present 
with his staff. 
Then he left them and went inside, where in five 
KK J  
-P-A-G-E-158

minutes typewriters were clicking and clattering; 
yet another five, and motor-cyclists were tearing off 
in a dozen directions. 
Presently it became known that a_ telephone 
message had been received from General Chetwode 
saying he had been engaged by the enemy’s cavalry 
at Binche, that they were concentrating between 
Mons and Bray, and were attacking briskly. 
Orderlies and messengers were arriving and de- 
parting every few minutes, and Russell, Spencer, and 
Hewson went off to the cavalry with messages. Smith 
got attached to a battalion that was short of officers, 
and M‘Laren and Tyrwhit went to the guns. Vivian, 
Oliver, and Dwyer were amongst those left ; and pre- 
sently a staff officer said the Commander-in-Chief 
wanted a message taken to General Hamilton, who, 
with two batteries of artillery, the Royal Irish, the 
Middlesex Regiment, and the Gordons, was holding 
a village some two or three miles west of Mons. 
The three of them were sent to General Hamilton, 
and Dwyer was told he could report himself to the 
major in command of the artillery, for duty, while 
Vivian and Oliver had permission to stay, if the 
General did not object. They got a lift in a car 
for a couple of miles, and walked the rest. Dwyer 
at once went off to his beloved guns, and Vivian 
and Oliver went to find the General and deliver the 
Commander-in-Chief’s letter. This done, they were 
standing amongst a little group of officers, when 
Vivian, looking at a tall officer, cried, ‘Why, it’s 
Charlie Cameron !’ 
‘Are you Drummond of the Guards or his double ?’ 
asked the tall Scotsman. 
‘Drummond himself, How are you, Cameron ?’ 
 
-P-A-G-E-159
  
THE BATTLE OF MONS. 147 
‘Tip-top. But why this rig? You look like 
the hero in a comic opera.’ 
Vivian laughed. ‘I suppose we are a bit con- 
spicuous amongst all your dull khaki. I’ve been 
serving with the Belgians, and so has my chum 
here. Let me introduce you.’ 
They shook hands, and Captain Cameron asked, 
“What are you going to do now ?’ 
‘See something of the fight, I hope.’ 
‘Why not come with me, then? Our trenches 
are about half a mile farther on, the other side of 
the main Paris road.’ 
‘With all my heart.’ And off they went. 
‘Have you heard that General Chetwode has 
been driven in from Binche?’ asked Captain 
Cameron. 
‘No.’ 
‘His brigade is somewhere away on our left.’ 
They reached the Gordons’ trenches—poor affairs, 
hastily dug, the brawny Highlanders being still 
busy with pick and spade. Oliver and Vivian, in 
their showy uniforms, attracted a good deal of 
attention ; but the word soon went round that they 
were ‘a’ richt,’ and many a broad grin they received. 
The Irish and Middlesex Regiments were on their 
left, almost at right angles, and all were ready for 
the Germans. Presently a great, whirring, buzzing 
sound was heard, and looking up, Oliver saw two 
aeroplanes circling and swooping above them. 
‘Taubes,’ he said; ‘you can tell them by their 
bird-like tails.’ 
‘Are you sure?’ asked Captain Cameron. ‘We 
have a good many of those gentry.’ 
‘Quite sure,’ said Oliver.  
-P-A-G-E-160
RRR a a i ia i i ih aR es se el La 
148 THE BATTLE OF MONS. 
They soon had evidence of the nationality of the 
airmen, for they dropped small smoke-balls, which 
hung in the air for a minute or so, just over the 
trenches. Hardly had the aeroplanes flown away 
than huge shells came humming through the air, 
and burst with great accuracy right over the 
trenches. 
A big Highlander just beside Oliver in the 
trench said to his right-hand man, ‘Lumme, Dave! 
them there birds ain’t ’arf artful. The blighters 
have spotted us, and give the tip to their bloomin’ 
artillery.’ 
‘Hallo! you’re not a Scotsman, at all events,’ 
laughed Oliver. 
‘Lor lumme! no, sir. I was born and bred in 
Camden Town, and afore I joined the only Scotch 
I knew anything abaht was Scotch whisky. But 
Nobby Stevens ain’t agoin’ to disgrace the “Gay 
Gordons,” for all that—eh, mates?’ and he turned 
to his comrades. 
A tough old sergeant carefully removed a pipe 
from his mouth, knocked out the ashes, and said, 
‘Gin yer hairt’s as big as yer tongue is lang, ma 
laddie, you’ll do a’ richt;’ at which the others 
laughed, as they ought when a sergeant deigns to 
make a joke. 
The shells came over with increasing frequency, 
the range having been found to a nicety; and pre- 
sently the shrapnel-bullets began to hiss down into 
the trenches, and several men were hit. There was 
a little restlessness at being struck down by an 
unseen foe, but the stretcher-bearers calmly picked 
up the wounded and carried them off to the rear. 
Murmurs were heard in the trench; whereupon 
 
-P-A-G-E-161
  THE BATTLE OF MONS. 149 
Captain Cameron, lighting a cigarette, scrambled 
out, and walking slowly along the whole length of 
the trench, said cheerily, ‘Keep steady, my brave 
lads; this is only a preliminary peppering; we ’ll 
get to business presently, never fear. Have your 
rifles ready.’ 
The aeroplanes continued to circle above them, 
and the Cockney cried, ‘Yer two bloomin’ ravens, 
come dahn a bit lower and I’ll do a bit o’ Bisley 
on yer. I’ve put a few balls on at a thousand yards, 
and I reckon I could ’it a German sausage at more’n 
that. I’d stop yer flyin’ and make yer do a bit o° 
’oppin’.’ 
Several men wanted to fire at the aeroplanes, but 
Captain Cameron would not let them. ‘It would 
only reveal our position more clearly,’ he said. 
An hour went by, and from the terrific firing on 
their left it was clear the Irish and Middlesex were 
very heavily engaged. The inaction began to get 
trying, when suddenly the British guns situated at 
the edge of the wood, some half-mile behind them, 
opened fire; on which the Gordons gave a lusty 
cheer. : 
Then Vivian, looking through his glasses, cried 
out, ‘Look there, away on our left; a number of 
women and children are coming this way.’ 
Several pairs of glasses were directed towards 
the spot, when suddenly Captain Cameron gave an 
angry exclamation. 
‘There are troops behind those. women,’ he said. 
‘Look, Drummond !’ 
Vivian gazed for some seconds. ‘You're right,’ 
he said; ‘it’s only another German trick. Masses 
of infantry are advancing towards us, and are
-P-A-G-E-162
150 THE BATTLE OF MONS. 
driving women and children in front of them to 
protect them.’ 
Cries of rage arose from the Gordons as they 
watched the dastardly Germans advancing, but not 
a shot was fired. 
Some seven or eight hundred yards in front of 
them was a forest, and it was clear the Germans were 
trying to reach that behind the shelter of the women 
and children, when the position of the Gordons 
would become untenable. But those unfortunate 
women had the hearts of heroines. Some waved 
their hands and shouted out to the British, ‘Fire! 
fire! Do not heed us.’ Others started off and ran 
towards the trenches or the village, and, to the 
everlasting disgrace of the Germans, shots were sent 
after them, and some of the soldiers were seen to 
bayonet those who fell. 
A perfect hurricane of shell-fire then broke out, 
and the British trenches were swept with shrapnel ; 
but the men kept perfectly cool. The British 
artillery was replying, and though its effect could 
not be seen, it was probable it was giving as much 
as it received. 
Suddenly, from the trench on their left, a terrific 
Maxim-fire was opened, and the Germans were seen 
to stop, reel, and fall in swaths. A tall officer 
waved them on with his sword, and the Germans 
advanced at the double in dense masses. Then 
Captain Cameron gave the word, and his men opened 
fire; and as they took careful aim, every bullet 
found at least two billets. The leading rank was 
simply blasted away, but another and another came 
swinging on, and always the tall officer was seen 
urging them forward. 
 
-P-A-G-E-163
THE BATTLE OF MONS. 151 
Steadying their rifles on the parapet of the 
trench, the Gordons fired and fired till the ground 
was littered with dead. But nearer and nearer 
the enemy got to the forest, though not one en- 
tered it. 
Fresh masses came up, and abandoning their 
attempt to gain the wood, made straight for the 
trenches. 
With a front of at least a hundred and fifty, 
and five files deep, they marched stolidly up, while 
the British bullets cut through and through them, 
till presently they halted, seemed to gaze about in a 
dazed fashion, and then appeared to crumple up. 
But always behind came more. 
They attacked with greater fury than at Liége; 
but the British fought more steadily than had the 
Belgians, and so the carnage went on. 
‘Talk abaht rabbit-shootin’ !’ said Nobby Stevens ; 
‘this licks it into fits. Why, these bloomin’ mokes 
ain’t got sense enough to git in aht o’ the rain.’ 
Ever nearer and nearer got the dense masses, and 
still the tall officer was on his feet; and presently 
they fixed bayonets and attempted to charge. This 
was too much for the Highlanders, Their fiery 
Celtic blood was aroused. Possibly some of their 
ancestors, claymore in hand, had charged down to 
death at Culloden. The steel always appealed to 
them. Their officers whipped out their claymores. 
‘Fix bayonets !’ they cried, and with a clink and 
a snap the vicious bits of steel were jerked on the 
ends of the rifle-barrels. 
‘Gordons to the front; form ranks; charge!’ 
and in a minute, with a yell that must have startled 
the Germans, the Highlanders flew at them. The
-P-A-G-E-164
152 THE BATTLE OF MONS. 
Germans uttered hoarse ‘hochs,’ and prepared to 
meet the charge. 
Oliver, sword in hand, was well in front, and, as 
they closed, recognised in the tall officer Moritz 
Falkenberg. He tried to avoid him, but Falkenberg 
fired his revolver at Oliver, narrowly missing him, 
and hitting a man just behind. 
Then the two parties met. The fury of the 
Scots was indescribable. They thrust and hacked, 
and the Germans fell like sheep. For a moment 
or two they tried to stand, then fled screaming. 
For a hundred yards the Highlanders followed, and 
just as the bugles rang out the recall Oliver received 
a glancing blow from the butt-end of a rifle, which 
knocked him dazed to the ground. For a few 
seconds he lay where he fell; then he heard a voice 
erying, ‘Pull yerself together, sir; these bloomin’ 
German sausages are comin’ back;’ and Nobby 
Stevens lifted him to his feet. 
Oliver gazed round him, a little dazed, and saw 
the Gordons retreating to their trenches, while the 
Germans were attempting to rally. 
‘Never mind me, old chap; you save yourself,’ 
said Oliver. 
‘What d’ yer tike me for—a bloomin’ blackleg, to 
leave an orficer in the lurch? Not Nobby. ’Ere, 
get on me back, sir, an’ we’ll ’op it together;’ and 
suiting the action to the word, the gallant fellow 
hoisted Oliver up, and, while the bullets fairly 
whistled round them, carried him for a hundred 
yards, till, with a sudden moaning gasp, he sank to 
the ground, Oliver with him. 
Gazing at the gallant Cockney, Oliver saw his 
face go ghastly white; but, with a brave smile, he
-P-A-G-E-165
THE BATTLE OF MONS. 153 
held up his hand. ‘I’d ha’ done it,’ he said; ‘ I’d 
ha’ done it, but the blighters have dropped me.’ 
He gave a shiver, and then fell back insen- 
sible. Oliver had hold of the outstretched hand, 
which was getting cold. He seized him round the 
body and dragged him a little way, the bullets 
‘zipping’ round all the while. Then a party who 
had seen their plight, with Vivian at their head, 
came running from the trenches and brought them 
both in. But poor ‘Nobby’ had gone to answer 
his name at the last muster, and the old sergeant, 
as he gently covered his face with a dirty hand- 
kerchief, said, ‘Puir laddie, his hairt was Scotch 
eneugh, for a’ his Cockney birth.’ ; 
‘I did not miss you till we were back in the 
trench,’ said Vivian to Oliver some minutes later. 
‘Thank God, you’re all right! This is warm work.’ 
A drink of water revived Oliver, but he took 
no part in driving back the next rush. 
An hour passed quietly, and then word was 
brought that the Royal Irish were hard pressed 
and wanted help. 
‘We must go to their assistance,’ said Captain 
Cameron, and with his company he left the trench 
and retired to the road. Crossing this, they crept 
into a ditch, and bending down, went along in single 
file for nearly a mile, the shrapnel bursting over 
them all the while. About a hundred and fifty 
yards from the trenches of the Royal Irish they 
came to a small white house, flush with the road, 
standing in a clearance. Captain Cameron dashed 
across the road; but he was seen, and a perfect 
hail of machine-gun fire was turned on the spot. 
Then one by one each man had to face the ordeal 
 
-P-A-G-E-166
154 THE BATTLE OF MONS. 
and run for his life across the white road. The 
bullets beat up little clouds of dust, but man by 
man they got across, till it came to Vivian’s turn. 
Calmly, with his sword at the slope and head erect, 
he marched across. 
‘He’s a bold laddie,’ said the old sergeant, who 
was next to go; and he also marched across, but 
fell in the middle of the road with a bullet in his 
leg. 
‘He’s down,’ cried several voices; and Oliver 
and another man ran out, and together carried him 
to momentary safety. The old Scot winced with 
the pain, but while the other men crossed one by 
one, with the help of several kindly hands he 
applied the first field-dressing, and then insisted 
on going on with his men, limping along, leaning on 
one man’s shoulder and using his rifle as a crutch. 
The trenches of the Royal Irish were reached, 
and it was found that they had been terribly cut 
up, as had the Middlesex Regiment, the old ‘Die 
Hards’ of Peninsular fame. 
The arrival of the Gordons was just in time; 
for the other two regiments, though they would 
have died to a man, could not have held the 
Germans back much longer. Another terrific attack 
by picked troops was delivered, but, firing as steadily 
as at a field-day, the remaining handful of British 
swept them away. 
Alas! there was no lack of rifles and ammunition, 
for the trenches were littered with dead, and the 
officers used rifles as skilfully as did the men. 
Oliver, quite recovered from his knock-down blow, 
fired till he could not touch the barrel of his rifle, 
it was so hot, before the attack was abandoned. 
*
-P-A-G-E-167
    8 ey Oh 
THE BATTLE OF MONS. 155 
As the Germans retreated in the dusk the British 
survivors gave cheer after cheer, for, though half 
their number had fallen, the spirits of the rest were 
as high as ever. 
Just as it was getting dark a body of German 
cavalry came galloping into sight and made straight 
for the trenches. 
‘Sure, they’re goin’ to roide over us,’ said an 
Trish private. 
‘They might think it an easier job than it is,’ 
said Vivian. ‘Infantry have nothing to fear from 
cavalry, boys, so long as they have plenty of 
ammunition,’ 
The horsemen got within five hundred yards of 
the trenches before the word to fire was given; 
then a vivid flash ran along the parapet, and 
the vaunted horsemen of the Kaiser were swept 
away. Men and horses went down in heaps; 
but again and again they came on, till human flesh 
and blood could stand no more, and they retired 
in turn. 
No sooner had they gone than the artillery again 
opened a furious fire, and common shell and shrapnel 
hurtled through the air, aimed with deadly accuracy, 
till, in the words of an Irish corporal, ‘it was just 
hell on earth.’ 
A staff officer came galloping up to Captain 
Cameron, riding through a perfect hurricane of shot, 
gave some instructions, and then went on to the 
next trench. 
‘Another cavalry attack is coming,’ was passed 
from mouth to mouth down the trench. ‘Fire, and 
cease fire, to the sound of the bugle.’ 
It was then almost dark, and soon the thunder 
* 
   
-P-A-G-E-168
156 THE BATTLE OF MONS. 
of horses’ hoofs was heard as Uhlans and Dragoons 
galloped up in a last mad attempt to ride over the 
British trenches. The bugles rang out, the magazine- 
rifles barked, and man and horse went down, until 
suddenly the bugle sounded ‘Cease fire.’ Though 
many a weary Tommy wondered why, no one 
questioned, and every rifle was silent. Then, like 
a thunder-clap, a regiment of British Hussars came 
charging down on the German flank, and rode 
through and through them, sabring them like sheep. 
The Kaiser’s hordes galloped for their lives, but the 
light cavalrymen pursued and cut them down; nor 
did they draw rein till they were well under the | 
German guns. 
As they came back, just as darkness fell, the 
infantrymen cheered them madly. 
Oliver, however, heard nothing, for, utterly ex- 
hausted, he had fallen asleep in his trench. 
The British were wildly exultant, for, though 
outnumbered ten to one, all through that dread- 
ful Sunday they had held the Kaiser’s hordes 
at bay. 
It seemed to Oliver that he had hardly closed his 
eyes when he was awakened by Vivian shaking his 
shoulder. ‘Wake up, old chap; make an effort,’ 
he said; ‘we are going to retreat.’ 
‘Retreat ?’ asked Oliver sleepily. ‘Why? The 
victory is ours, isn’t it ?’ 
‘Yes, my boy; but the French have given way 
all along the line. That’s put us in a hole. 
There are strange rumours afloat, but we’ve got 
to fall back;’ and, amidst the grumbling of the 
men, they vacated the trenches they had held so 
valiantly all day, and, leaving their dead behind, 
 
-P-A-G-E-169
THE BATTLE OF MONS. 157 
began that masterly retreat which so enraged the 
army and depressed those at home during those 
fateful August days, when the German hordes put 
out their maximum efforts to crush ‘French’s con- 
temptible little army.’
-P-A-G-E-170
CHAPTER XVIIL 
FIGHTING STEP BY STEP. 
§ HAT the deuce is the good of this re- 
treatin’ ?’ growled a soldier, as he wearily 
gave his ‘pack’ a hunch up on his back, the while 
he held his rifle between his knees. {We’ve given 
them bloomin’ goose-steppers gippo to-day; and 
after we’ve had a nap and put the nose-bag on 
for ten minutes, we’re ready to go for them agen 
to-morrer, and stick it till we’ve mopped ’em 
up or they’ve put us out. What more can they 
want ?’ 
‘That’s what I want to know, Shiner,’ agreed 
his chum. ‘ Advancin’ an’ fightin’ there ain’t nothin’ 
to say against ; but this ’ere retreatin’, I never ’eard 
tell o’ that sort o’ thing afore—leastways not for 
British soljers.’ 
The sentiments expressed by the two chums were 
practically those of the whole army, and thousands 
that night expressed the same views. 
Discipline, however, is the backbone of the British 
Army, and with cheering words officers and non- 
coms. told the men it was necessary, and Tommy 
acquiesced with his usual solace, ‘that it was all 
in his seven,’ alluding to his seven years with the 
colours, 
‘Although,’ said Oliver to Vivian, ‘I think it’s 
about time some one made a stand against these 
Germans; they ’re having it a great deal too much 
their own way to please me.’
-P-A-G-E-171
FIGHTING STEP BY STEP. 159 
‘He who fights and runs away, 
Lives to fight another day,’ 
quoted Vivian. 
But a sergeant, busy seeing that his platoon 
were all out of the trench, overheard the words. 
‘Don’t call it running away, sir,’ he cried, ‘or not 
a man will budge;’ and it is probable he spoke 
the bare truth. 
‘Leave it to the General, sergeant,’ laughed Vivian. 
‘Call it what you like, but, depend upon it, the 
whole thing has been thought out, and the end of 
it all will be a big stand and a good thrashing for 
the enemy.’ 
“Ear, ’ear!’ cried several voices; and soon they 
got on the move. 
Not for long were they unmolested. Shrapnel 
began to burst over them; and then, the moon 
being very brilliant, rifle-fire dropping amongst 
them showed the Germans were in pursuit. The 
men would have faced about and seen the matter 
out, but a staff officer had said that on no account 
were they to halt, and so they pressed on, picking 
up their wounded as they went, and leaving only 
the dead behind. 
For.a mile or two this continued, and then another 
annoyance was encountered. An armoured motor- 
car, fitted with a searchlight, was following them up, 
and, turning its bright beams upon them, was pour- 
ing in machine-gun fire, causing considerable loss. 
‘Look here,’ said Oliver savagely as he trudged 
wearily along, ‘this is too much! Aren’t we going 
to bite a bit in return ?’ 
A young lieutenant marching beside him chewed 
his moustache savagely. ‘Keep the boys together,’ 
 
-P-A-G-E-172
Be ce nn ne ett a nt a es 
160 FIGHTING STEP BY STEP. 
he said, ‘while I go and have a word with the 
major, and try to get permission to settle that chap.’ 
In ten minutes he was back. ‘Right-o,’ he said ; 
‘we'll give ’em something.’ 
The remains of his platoon were halted, took 
what shelter they could on each side of the road, 
and then, slipping an extra clip into their magazines, 
waited. Presently the beams of the searchlight 
| came creeping along the road, searching the bushes 
| on either side; but every man lay still as death, and 
there was a positive chuckle as the motor came on, 
only the glaring eye being visible. Nearer, nearer 
it came, the hoarse rattle of its machine-gun, 
hammering like the violent thudding of a motor- 
cycle, getting ever louder. 
The men were so eager to get at their enemy that 
they could hardly be restrained, and it took all the 
persuasion of the officers to keep them quiet. 
‘Wait till you get the word,’ said Vivian to those 
near him; ‘the nearer: you let this fellow approach, 
the more likely we are to smash him up.’ 
The young lieutenant in command was kneeling 
with Vivian and Oliver, and they had arranged 
together their little plan. The armed motor got 
closer, and as it was seen that a half-troop of 
cavalry rode behind as an escort, the spirits of the 
handful of British soldiers rose higher. 
‘We'll have a bigger bag than we thought,’ said 
Oliver, as the motor came in sight. It was com- 
pletely covered with metal plates, painted gray, the 
gun being fired from a sort of port-hole in front. 
‘Let me have four men, and leave the motor to 
me,’ suggested Vivian to the lieutenant. ‘You settle 
the cavalry, and I’ll tackle the machine.’ 
 
-P-A-G-E-173
  FIGHTING STEP BY STEP. 161 
‘Right you are,’ agreed the lieutenant; ‘only 
don’t let him escape; I don’t mean going on till 
that beggar ’s out of action.’ 
All lay silent till the motor was opposite them. 
It was allowed to pass, as were the Dragoons ac- 
companying it; then a loud command rang out— 
‘Fire !’ 
The magazines spat their fire viciously among the 
cavalry ; a dozen crashed down, and the remainder 
wheeled round in wild confusion in order to gallop 
back along the road. But the biting fire met them 
full in the face, and ere the maddened horses could 
bear their terrified riders into safety, with a terrific 
yell the British dashed out with the bayonet and 
charged right in amongst the horses. 
Meanwhile Oliver, Vivian, and four men made for 
the car. At the first alarm the machine-gun had 
rattled out a “belt of cartridges, but there was no 
enemy in front, and no harm was done. 
‘Take this side, Noll, and I’ll take the other,’ 
cried Vivian, as they ran, pistol in hand. ‘Shoot 
the driver !’ 
The motor was a huge affair, divided into two 
parts, the gun in the front and the searchlight in 
the rear. ‘ 
Running to the forward part, Oliver climbed on 
the step, just as a fusillade from rifles and pistols 
was opened. As he stood on the step Oliver saw 
a rifle-barrel protruding from a slit in the armour 
above him; he seized the barrel with one hand, 
and thrusting in his revolver with the other, fired 
several shots. A private behind him jabbed his 
bayonet violently through the opening, and a shrill 
cry came from inside. Then the motor made a 
ike . K
-P-A-G-E-174
  162 FIGHTING STEP BY STEP. 
sudden lurch forward, and one of the soldiers on 
Oliver’s side was jerked off into the road. 
The powerful engine whirled the car forward, and 
Oliver had as much as he could do to hold on. In 
a few seconds there was a great shouting inside ; 
then the engine stopped, and Oliver, jumping off, 
ran round to the other side, to see Vivian stepping 
down. 
‘I got in just in time,’ he said coolly. ‘Both 
my men were thrown off, and the engineer was 
evidently going to dash the whole thing into the 
first obstacle he met, and smash it up. I had to 
pistol him.’ 
A dozen men who had been following the motor 
came running up, and two Germans who had been 
working the searchlight held up their hands and 
cried for mercy. 
‘I should let them go,’ said Vivian to the lieu- 
tenant ; ‘we can’t be troubled with prisoners.—Here, 
one of you chaps, help me to clear out these bodies ;’ 
and three dead Germans were taken out of the car 
and laid in the road. 
By that time the German cavalry, with the excep- 
tion of one or two who had managed to escape, had 
been killed, and the little body re-formed behind 
the captured car. 
‘I say, this is ripping,’ cried the lieutenant; 
‘those old Germans won’t be so confident for a little 
while, I’ll bet. But what shall we do with the 
car ?’ 
‘Take it on with us.’ 
‘Who ’ll drive it ?” 
‘T will, if no one else can; but perhaps there’s a 
mechanic amongst the men.’
-P-A-G-E-175
FIGHTING STEP BY STEP. 163 
‘T did two years’ motor-bus driving before I came 
back to the colours,’ said a man. 
‘Hop in, then, and let’s get off,’ said Vivian. 
Two wounded men were picked up, and the whole 
set off after their companions. They were in excel- 
lent spirits; their successful little action had made 
them forget their fatigue, and singing lustily, they 
strode off, and soon came up with their companions, 
who received them with a hearty cheer. 
But the Germans, enraged at losing their machine- 
gun, pressed them hard, and time and again the 
wearied men had to halt, turn, and send in a few 
volleys to keep their pursuers at a respectable 
distance. 
‘The chaps won’t be able to go on much longer,’ 
said Oliver to Vivian ; ‘they ’re almost done up, and 
I’m quite so.’ 
. The roads were getting very congested, and a 
squadron of cavalry joined them. They were amongst 
the last of the troops, and the dust and heat were 
fearful. Thirst, too, raged, and there was no means 
of quenching it. 
Presently a staff officer trotted up and asked for 
the officer in command. Finding him, he told him 
they were just going to cross the Mons canal, and 
that they would be the last detachment to pass. 
‘The sappers have mined the bridge,’ he said, 
‘and your men are to stay as a support with them 
till the bridge is blown up.’ 
Anything that promised the men a rest was 
welcome; and when at last they had crossed the 
bridge, on which the Engineers were still at work, 
they rushed to the water and drank their fill, and 
then threw themselves down on the ground.
-P-A-G-E-176
  164 FIGHTING STEP BY STEP. 
In two minutes Oliver was fast asleep, to be 
awakened presently by a sergeant, who whispered to 
him, ‘The enemy is near, sir; we have got to form.’ 
Refreshed by his brief sleep, Oliver roused him- 
self, and was soon lying with the rest of the men, 
watching the bridge, whose white road gleamed in 
the moonlight. 
The Engineers were lying close to Oliver, and 
Vivian, who was with them, whispered to the subal- 
tern in charge, ‘You ’re cutting it a bit fine, aren’t 
you ?’ 
“Our charge is absolutely certain to explode,’ he 
answered ; ‘and we might just as well send a few 
Huns to Kingdom Come at the same time.’ 
Soon some cavalrymen appeared on the bridge, 
and crossing, looked about them, but without per- 
ceiving the hidden British, They trotted back, 
returning with the head of a column. This was 
already on the bridge before the Engineer sprang 
his mine. Then there was a flash, a terrific roar, 
and the centre of the bridge, with all on it, was 
hurled into the air. 
Shouts and yells from the other side of the 
bridge went up, but the British party sent half-a- 
dozen volleys across the canal as a parting gift, 
and continued their retreat, comparatively unmolested, 
for an hour or two. Then halting, and throwing 
themselves down on the ground, they fell asleep 
where they were. f 
Soon after daybreak reveille sounded, and, thanks 
to the splendid efforts of the Army Service Corps, 
a good breakfast was served out. 
‘Fall in, boys!’ cried the officers cheerfully, and 
the men obeyed with alacrity. 
 
-P-A-G-E-177
  FIGHTING STEP BY STEP. 165 
Pouches were filled with ammunition, and away 
they went, not halting again till they reached 
Harmignies. Here they joined the 2nd Division, 
among which was Vivian’s own regiment, the Cold- 
streams. He at once went to the colonel and 
reported himself, meeting with a cordial reception 
from his fellow-officers. He was appointed to a 
company, in place of a lieutenant who had been 
killed on the previous day. Some friends in the 
regiment were able amongst them to rig him and 
Oliver out in khaki, which was a welcome change, 
as since they had joined their own countrymen 
they had often found their Belgian uniforms very 
inconvenient. 
Oliver had no official status, but Vivian took him 
to the General in command and explained matters, 
asking if he could be attached to the Coldstreams. 
‘I am afraid I cannot do that, Mr Drummond,’ 
said the General. ‘Mr Hastings’s service has been 
with the cavalry, and you know you Guardsmen 
are very tenacious about your privileges. I will 
see, however, that he is attached to the cavalry, and 
he can report himself to the colonel when the fight- 
ing is less severe.’ 
A strong force of artillery was with the division, 
and the welcome news went round that they were 
going to advance and attack Binche. The Germans 
were in front in great numbers, and they were very 
hotly engaged for several hours. 
Aeroplanes of both forces were circling above 
them, and during a lull in the fighting Oliver, who 
had kept with Vivian, said, ‘Look! there’s a fight 
~ in the air.’ 
All looked up and saw a German Taube and a
-P-A-G-E-178
  166 FIGHTING STEP BY STEP. 
British biplane. Each was manceuvring to get above 
the other, and thousands watched breathlessly. First 
the Taube ascended, then the biplane, the flashes 
showing that every now and then they were firing at 
each other. Soon the Englishman got well over the 
German, and blazed away at him with a revolver, 
the troops cheering wildly. But the German got 
away, and made for his own lines; whereupon the 
Englishman went straight at him, as though to dash 
into him. The German suddenly dropped, and the 
flashes from the English machine showed that the 
pilot was firing at him. A moment later the Taube 
turned upside-down and came crashing to the earth. 
It fell not far from Oliver and Vivian, who, with 
many others, ran over to the débris, among which 
they found both the Germans, dead. The machine 
was set on fire, and soon after a retirement was 
ordered. The attack on Binche had been only a 
feint, but it had been successful, for under cover of 
it the whole of the 2nd Corps had made good its 
retreat upon the line Dour-Quarouble-Frameries. 
But word was brought that the 5th Division was 
very hardly pressed, and the Guards, with some 
cavalry, were hurried off to its assistance. 
‘I’ve just heard that the French have fallen back 
on our right,’ whispered Vivian to Oliver, ‘and Von 
Kluck, with huge forces, at least four to one, is 
endeavouring to turn our left flank. If he does 
that, I don’t know what will happen.’ 
‘We ’ll die where we stand,’ said Oliver simply ; 
and that was the fixed determination of every gallant 
Briton among them. 
They had to fight every foot of the way to the 
5th Division, but the British Guardsmen fought
-P-A-G-E-179
FIGHTING STEP BY STEP. 167 
superbly, and presently reached their hardly pressed 
comrades. ‘The artillery fire was simply appalling, 
and when that ceased whole clouds of gray-green 
infantry and cavalry advanced. 
There was no chance of entrenching ; so, dropping 
on the ground, the Guards, taking what cover they 
could, poured in withering volleys, cutting down the 
Germans like corn. 
But they were before the Prussian Guard Division, 
who were determined to sweep the contemptible 
British from their path, and massing in thousands, 
they came pressing on, till at two hundred yards they 
fixed bayonets and essayed a charge. 
Then the British officers leapt up and drew their 
swords, 
‘Coldstreams,’ cried the captain of Vivian’s com- 
pany, ‘remember your traditions) The murderers 
of women and children are before you. If we 
fail, our women and children are in danger. Fix 
bayonets !” 
What a cheer rolled over the ensanguined field as 
the giants of the Guards, sick to death of lying down 
blazing at monotonous hosts, leapt to their feet! 
What a yell of joy as the bayonets flashed from 
their scabbards! How the men’s eyes glittered as 
they flung off their packs and formed up! In a 
minute all was ready, and the officers, taking their 
places in front, waved their swords and shouted the 
magic word ‘Charge !’ 
‘Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!’ and they raced for- 
ward, the lust of battle in brain and heart. They 
met the vaunted Prussian troops; there was a fear- 
ful shock ; then the bayonets were red and dripping. 
One, two, three! each Guardsman slew three Germans 
 
-P-A-G-E-180
168 FIGHTING STEP BY STEP. 
to every Briton that fell. Rifles were clubbed 
and German heads were smashed like eggs; the 
officers used sword and pistol in that deadly press 
with fearful effect, and the guttural ‘hochs’ of the 
Germans were drowned by the deep ‘hurrahs’ of 
the British, : 
A sort of moaning wail burst from the Germans ; 
their arms seemed to grow nerveless; they wavered, 
for they were being bayoneted in hundreds, the whole 
British line having advanced. Then, conquered, 
terror-stricken, they turned and fled, screaming 
wildly ; while the exultant Britons, the old Berserk 
fury roused in them, pursued, smote, and spared not. 
Bitterly will the Prussian Guards ever remember that 
day. The recall was sounded, and after firing at the 
Germans till they were out of range, the British 
retired to their original position. 
‘I’m satisfied,’ said Vivian to Oliver as they lay 
side by side half-an-hour later. ‘I’ve seen the 
braggarts of Berlin, the Kaiser’s show troops, tearing 
for their lives before the British Guards.’ 
Contrary to expectation, yet another attack was 
made by the Germans; but this was met by the 
5th Division, which drove them back. While this 
was going on the 9th Lancers and 18th Hussars 
came suddenly wheeling round on their left, and 
formed to charge. The infantry, excited spectators, 
watched the troopers, and gave them a cheer as they 
dashed in on the German flank. 
‘Hallo! what’s the matter?’ cried Oliver; and 
looking, all saw the British cavalry falling over, 
men and horses in wild confusion. The rear ranks 
crashed into the front ranks, and some hundreds 
were down. While all was confusion, a battery of
-P-A-G-E-181
  FIGHTING STEP BY STEP. 169 
concealed German machine-guns opened fire, and the 
gallant troopers went down in scores, never having 
reached their foe. 
‘What on earth can have happened?’ repeated 
Oliver. 
‘Barbed wire entanglements, for a thousand!’ 
answered Vivian sadly ; and so it proved. 
An infantry advance was ordered to cover the 
retreat of the cavalry, and a feeling of bitter annoy- 
ance filled every heart at the mishap. 
The 5th Division, being freed from the pressure 
upon them, continued their retreat under heavy fire, 
until a fortunate reinforcement, in the shape of the 
19th Brigade, which had been hurried up from the 
lines of communication, arrived, and taking the rear- 
most, faced the Germans, and gave their war-worn 
comrades a few hours’ well-earned respite. 
That night the division with which were Oliver 
and Vivian rested on the west of Bavai, their right 
being protected by the fortress of Maubeuge, against 
which it had been Von Kluck’s aim to crush them. 
‘Vivian,’ said Oliver as he laid himself on the 
ground that night, ‘unless I get a good sleep I feel 
I shall break down.’ 
‘I’m that way myself, Noll; but we mustn’t give 
in. Remember those at home; remember Louvain ; 
and then you’ll feel you’d suffer untold torments 
sooner than let the Germans conquer.’

. a boys, don’t forget to get your pouches full 
of “pills” for the Germans.’ 
| The above words of a sergeant-major of the 
Guards, cheery as though on parade at Wellington 
Barracks, were the first Oliver heard as he drowsily 
opened his eyes while it was yet dark in the early 
morning of 25th August. 
‘Tumble out, Noll, my boy! Show a leg, as our 
Tommies say at home,’ cried Vivian. 
‘I say, old chap, are you never tired?’ asked 
Oliver. 
‘We dare not be tired, Oliver; we shall have all 
our lives to rest in after we’ve whacked the 99 “ Deutschers. 
‘I almost envy those poor fellows who are taking 
their long rest,’ yawned Oliver. 
‘Tut, tut! Have you never read old Napier’s 
undying story of the retreat on Corunna ?’ 
‘TI have, but never realised what it meant till now.’ 
‘But consider, laddie, you are now helping to 
make history; future generations will read of our 
doings, and will wonder what fashion of men we 
were.’ 
‘And I expect they ’ll realise as little as you and 
I do when we read of Sir John Moore’s men. , 
don’t suppose any one of them will ever dream that 
what we are all at this moment longing for is a 
good bath.’ 
 
-P-A-G-E-183
A DIPLOMATIC MISSION. LGE 
‘Sybarite! You mustn’t think of such things! 
Fighting ’s the order of the day, and if we go down, 
we shall stand as good a chance of getting to heaven 
dirty as clean.’ 
‘Or of winning the V.C., which I should much 
prefer.’ 
‘A praiseworthy wish! Now for breakfast, and 
then for the march! In any case we ’re not starved, 
and ever after this I shall feel inclined to salute all 
members of the A.S.C. for their untiring efforts in 
giving us grub.’ 
‘Not forgetting our old motor-busmen in buzzing 
up ammunition.’ 
Cheery as ever, breakfast was eaten and the 
troops fell in, though there was a great deal of 
‘grousing’ about the everlasting retreat. But re- 
treat it had to be; the French attack had failed, 
and the British were isolated, and all through that 
day the gallant soldiers marched and fought, marched 
and fought, while ever the German artillery thundered, 
their aeroplanes dropped bombs, and the gray hordes 
pressed on. 
Every now and then some exasperated British 
soldier, whose chum had been shot beside him, would 
complain impatiently to his officer about ‘retreatin’ 
from the bloomin’ German pigs,’ and ask when they 
‘were goin’ for the blighters with the baynit ;’ and 
his officer, more sick of the retreat than the private, 
would reply with soothing, cheering words, and 
promise his men that, with a little patience, a little 
waiting, all would be well—that the retreat was 
part of a carefully thought-out plan, that the Ger- 
mans were advancing to their destruction, and that 
soon our turn to attack would begin. ‘An’ Gawd 
 
-P-A-G-E-184
LT2 A DIPLOMATIC MISSION. 
’elp the bounders when it does!’ Tommy would reply 
grimly ; and his clenched jaws boded little good to 
the Germans when his chance came, for as our men 
retreated they saw the Jmerciless barbarity with 
which the Huns were treating the natives. Many 
a hardened veteran of several campaigns was 
ashamed of the tears that stole unbidden down his 
cheeks when he saw what women and little children 
suffered at the hands of ‘the most cultured nation.’ 
During that day both Vivian and Oliver had 
several narrow escapes. Oliver had his sword- 
scabbard bent by a fragment of shell, and Vivian 
had two bullets through the skirts of his tunic; but 
evening saw them, weary to death, though still defiant, 
before the little French market-town of Landrecies. 
It was dark when they reached the town, and, 
utterly exhausted, the men threw themselves down 
in the streets to sleep. Sleep, sleep was all they 
wanted. They were hungry and thirsty, but that 
could wait; sleep was imperative. But sleep was 
not for them yet; scarcely half-an-hour had passed 
when the alarm sounded. The 9th Army Corps was 
debouching from the Forest of Mormal, north-east of 
the town, and an exhausted British division was 
heavily engaged. 
‘Our comrades are outnumbered and in want of 
help,’ was the ery of a staff officer; and the gallant 
Guardsmen, forgetting hunger, thirst, and fatigue, 
roused themselves, and marched off to the rescue. 
They repelled attack after attack, while the 
1st Division retreated behind them. Then the 
Guards fell back on Landrecies, and fierce street 
fighting ensued. 
At the end of a narrow street a number of
-P-A-G-E-185
  » A DIPLOMATIC MISSION, Ls 
machine-guns were posted, and the Guards Brigade 
formed behind them to hold the town to the last, 
and so enable their exhausted comrades to reach 
safety. 
The Germans, in their massed formations, came 
blundering on; the Guards stood and waited grimly 
till the Germans, packed like sardines, filled the 
narrow street. Then came their opportunity for 
paying off old scores. The machine-guns opened 
fire pitilessly, and swept away the crown of the 
German column. A fearful panic ensued; the men 
fought‘ and tore to get away, but those behind 
blocked the way. The German officers, accustomed 
to shoot with their revolvers from behind those who 
gave way, were unable to check the stampede, and, 
better still, were unable to save their own skins. 
The pitiless hail of lead swept the street, and in ten 
minutes between eight and nine hundred corpses lay 
weltering in their own blood. That checked the 
German enthusiasm, and the timely arrival of two 
French reserve divisions, the first French soldiers 
seen since Mons, relieved the pressure, and the 
British could take a breathing-spell and rest. 
Both Vivian and Oliver had been with the 
machine-guns, and they felt a grim satisfaction at 
the punishment dealt out. 
‘They ’ve asked for it, and they ’ve got it,’ said 
Vivian ; ‘it will teach them that the British bulldog 
can still bite hard.’ 
An hour later, in a comfortable farmhouse, Oliver 
and Vivian were enjoying their supper. They had 
just finished, when a staff officer entered, and looking 
round, asked, ‘Can any of you fellows tell me where 
I can find Captain Mainwaring ?’   
 
-P-A-G-E-186
  174 A DIPLOMATIC MISSION. 
‘Shot through the heart by my side early in the 
day,’ replied a subaltern quietly. 
‘Poor Mainwaring !’ said the staff officer ; ‘as nice 
a chap as ever lived. It will be a sad blow to his 
poor little wife.’ 
‘And to his father, for he was the only son.’ 
But death had been so busy amongst them during 
the last few days that no one else referred to the 
subject. Already the Guards had lost half their 
officers, and each of those left felt that he might 
be the next to go, and with death, as with every- 
thing else, familiarity breeds contempt. 
‘The Chief particularly wanted an officer who 
can speak both French and German,’ continued the 
staff officer, ‘and such men are as rare among us as 
honourable men amongst Germans.’ 
Vivian looked at the officer. ‘If French and 
German are of any use, I am fairly at home with 
those languages, and so is my chum here.’ 
The staff officer thought a moment. ‘The Chief 
is a bit chary of strangers,’ he said; ‘but I don’t 
know; you might do. Will you both come with 
me ?’ 
‘This moment ;’ and in two minutes the three 
were whizzing along in a sixty-horse-power Mercedes 
to general headquarters. 
Half-an-hour found them in Sir John French’s 
presence. There were anxious lines round the Com- 
mander-in-Chief’s eyes, but his manner was as cool 
and calm as ever. He looked at the staff officer, 
then at Vivian and Oliver. 
‘Captain Mainwaring was killed this morning, 
sir; but these officers speak both French and German 
fluently.’ 
 
-P-A-G-E-187
A DIPLOMATIC MISSION. “75 
‘Is poor Mainwaring gone too?’ replied General 
French. ‘He's a loss to the army as well as to 
society ;’ and he shook his head sadly. Then, turn- 
ing ‘to Oliver and Vivian, he said, ‘Ha, our Belgian 
officers! Let me see; you’re Drummond of the 
Coldstreams, aren’t you ?’ 
‘Yes, Sir John.’ 
‘And this young man’s regiment ?’ 
‘Not attached yet.’ 
‘H’m! that must be seen to. Didn’t you say 
you held a commission in the Yeomanry ?’ 
‘Yes, Sir John,’ replied Oliver. 
‘Then you must be attached to the cavalry. I 
can have no unattached officers here; in case of 
accidents they are apt to get lost sight of—See to 
it, Markham, will you?’ and he turned to one of 
his under-secretaries, 
He spoke quickly to one or two brigadiers who 
were with him, and then he turned to Vivian. ‘I 
have heard good reports of you, and of Mr Hastings,’ 
he said. ‘You shall both accompany Major Bishop, 
and, if necessary, act as interpreters for him. He 
will explain all that is necessary as you go along.’ 
Oliver and Vivian saluted and went outside, being 
joined in a few minutes by a fat, jolly fellow, who 
offered each a cigar. 
‘My name’s Bishop, he said. ‘I’m going to 
take a letter to General Fleurot at Avesnes, and I 
understand you gentlemen are coming with me to 
supplement my French, which is poor. Languages 
are a weak point with us English. Captain Main- 
waring was going, but, poor fellow! I hear he’s 
killed.’ ‘ 
‘Yes, this morning,’ replied, Vivian. 
 
-P-A-G-E-188
  176 A DIPLOMATIC MISSION. 
‘Jolly decent of you to volunteer for this duty, 
for I know you must be dog-tired with fighting and 
marching. How on earth our chaps have stuck 
it I don’t know, and the Guards have behaved 
magnificently.’ 
‘Every one has done his duty; there is little to 
choose between regiments.’ 
‘True; and it will all have been in vain if 
things don’t alter. I suppose you know the general 
position ?” 
‘I know nothing except what I’ve seen just in 
front of my nose.’ 
‘Ah, of course not. Well, here’s our car. Jump 
in. I know the road pretty well.’ 
They were soon going at a pace to delight the 
scorcher’s heart, but the car was a fine one, and 
seemed to glide along. 
“You know we’re in a deuce of a fix,’ said Major 
Bishop. ‘Old Von Kluck is trying his very hardest 
to turn our left flank and hem us up against 
Maubeuge. If he does that hell surround us, and 
with his vast superiority in numbers he must then 
crush us. We’re reckoning that he must be pretty 
well exhausted, and we know he’s suffered enormous 
losses. But he can afford them, while we can’t; 
and our men are as done-up as-his.’ 
‘They ’re almost. played out,’ said Vivian, ‘but 
still full of spirit.’ ‘ 
‘True enough. Still, they must have rest and 
time to entrench before we can hope to stem this 
German torrent. Now at Avesnes there are three 
French cavalry divisions under General Fleurot, and 
yesterday Sir John himself called on him and 
begged of him to move up and cover our retreat.
-P-A-G-E-189
A DIPLOMATIC MISSION. 1 
Fleurot said his horses were too done-up to move, 
but that he would chip in to-day. He hasn’t 
turned up; and now I’m going with a pretty stiff 
letter from the Chief, and I’m to rub it in verbally. 
That’s where my weak French will drop me.’ 
‘Ah,’ said Vivian, snapping his jaws after his 
manner when he was determined, ‘I see. I’ve 
thought it rather funny that the French have fallen 
back so rapidly and completely.’ 
The pace at which they were going made talking 
difficult, and little more was said. A dozen times 
they were stopped by British and French sentries 
and patrolling parties, but Vivian and Oliver’s 
fluent French came in, and at last they reached 
Avesnes and were ushered ‘into General Fleurot’s 
presence. Vivian was not at all impressed with the 
appearance of the General, who was enjoying a 
very substantial supper. Major Bishop handed over 
his letter, and the General turned pale, and then 
flushed, as he read it. 
‘Ah, bad, bad; very bad!’ he said. ‘The poor 
‘English, how they fight! How they must have 
suffered! And here I am, unable to move on 
account of my horses. It is all very sad. Ah, 
those Germafis, they are devils!’ 
‘Sir John French bade me also say that unless he 
receives support to-morrow we cannot answer for 
the consequences,’ said Major Bishop. 
‘Mon Diew! is it as bad as that? And me; 
what can I do?’ and the General shrugged his 
shoulders and extended the palms of his hands. 
‘Can you not move up a division to cover the 
retirement of one of our corps?’ asked Major 
Bishop.

178 A DIPLOMATIC MISSION. 
‘Impossible, my dear major. How can I? My 
horses are not fit to travel ;’ and the General gabbled 
away at a rate which Major Bishop clearly could, 
not follow. 
Vivian saw that the General was trying to over- 
whelm Major Bishop with a torrent of words, and 
when he had done the young Guardsman said quietly, 
‘The great Napoleon would have marched his 
Dragoons on foot, General, rather than see a gallant 
ally outnumbered. If we are surrounded to-morrow, 
Paris will know, London will know, all the world 
will know it was because General Fleurot would not 
move to the assistance of his country’s ally.’ 
The General gave Vivian a startled look; then 
his face flushed angrily. ‘Do you dare insinuate, 
monsieur,’ he said, ‘that I will not move? It is 
because I cannot.’ 
‘You ’ll have to when the Germans arrive, or else 
people might draw comparisons between General 
Fleurot at Avesnes and Marshal Bazaine at Metz.’ 
The General turned pale once more, and said, 
‘Tell Sir John French I will move to-morrow. I 
will risk all. For France and our gallant Allies I 
will make any sacrifice.’ 
‘Will you give me a letter to that effect ?’ asked 
Major Bishop. 
Again the General looked angry, but calling in 
one of his aides-de-camp, he had the letter written 
and handed over. The three Englishmen then 
saluted and withdrew, and in five minutes were 
on their way back. 
‘I don’t care much for the look of that chap,’ 
said Oliver as they bowled along. 
‘I don’t think the Chief quite trusted him,’ said
-P-A-G-E-191
  A DIPLOMATIC MISSION. 179 
Major Bishop. ‘But you dropped a bomb on him 
with that hint about Napoleon.’ 
‘It’s generally a name to conjure with amongst 
French officers,’ said Vivian. ‘What can be the 
man’s idea ?’ 
‘Goodness knows!’ said Major Bishop. ‘Let’s 
call it funk, or reluctance to take responsibility.’ 
‘I shouldn’t care about being in his shoes if 
through him anything goes wrong.’ 
‘Well, we shall have to leave that to our supe- 
riors to settle amongst them. I only know that 
to-morrow will be the critical day. Until we have 
put the Somme, or the Oise, or some such obstacle 
between us and the Germans, we’re in danger of 
being cut to pieces.’ 
‘Which operation, depend upon it, will be costly 
for the Germans,’ said Oliver. 
   
-P-A-G-E-192
  CHAPTER XX. 
THE BULLDOG BREED AT BAY. 
‘CITEADY, boys; steady. We must hang on; the 
rest of the lads are depending on us. The 
British Army is not going to be defeated by a crowd 
of German waiters and clerks.’ 
Oliver turned a perspiring face round from the 
ditch beside the road, which a handful of men had 
been holding since before daybreak, and saw General 
Smith Dorrien, his calm face showing nothing of 
the anxiety which must have been consuming him, 
walking along behind them. 
‘The General, boys!’ said Vivian, always close to 
his chum Oliver; ‘the General! Give him a cheer.’ 
And cheer they did, with such a will that the 
General's face flushed with pleasure. 
‘Ay, ay, my lads,’ he said, ‘I know you’re the 
right stuff; heroes every one of you. You’ve done 
splendidly ; a little more and the Germans must 
give up.’ 
Cheery words, but in his heart the General could 
not have thought they would be realised. Since 
the first streaks of dawn they had been resisting the 
most furious attacks by the picked soldiers of the 
Kaiser. The War Lord had given orders that 
the British Army must be exterminated, and Von 
Kluck and his military machines were doing their 
best to obey. The Prussian Guard Division, the 
‘Invincibles,’ were given the task, and bravely 
enough they had essayed to carry it out. A most 
 
-P-A-G-E-193
        THE BULLDOG BREED AT BAY. 181 
determined attempt to outflank the British was 
made, and the heroic 4th Division had extended its 
line to check the movement. It had been ordered 
to continue its retreat at daybreak, but by then the 
guns of four German army corps were in position 
against it, and such an avalanche of shell was rained 
upon the British troops that even to attempt to move 
meant annihilation. 
Gallantly the British artillery, outnumbered four 
to one, replied, and so magnificently were the guns 
served that the Germans found it impossible to 
advance. 
But as the British fire dwindled the Germans 
pushed home their attack. Time after. time the 
gray masses advanced, and with the same deadly 
monotony the British checked them, until the time 
came to fix bayonets and give them the steel. Then, 
with the old ringing British cheer, the khaki-clad 
heroes, peer’s son and ploughman, shoulder to 
shoulder, dashed out and drove the Teuton back, 
and waited for the next horde. 
Six times had Oliver, with the gallant Cold- 
streams, charged that day, and of a hundred and 
twenty men of the company who had answered to 
their names that morning, scarcely forty were on 
their feet when General Smith Dorrien addressed 
his cheery words to them. 
The carnage was fearful; every man felt that he 
would never leave that field alive, but not one 
wavered. For ‘England, home, and beauty’ the 
recruit of nineteen and the reservist of nearly 
double his age were prepared to lay down their 
lives, not in any heroie spirit, but simply because 
‘it was their job.’
-P-A-G-E-194
  182 THE BULLDOG BREED AT BAY. 
‘I faced the charge of the Fuzzie-wuzzies in the 
Soudan, and helped bust up the old Boers at 
Paardeberg, Beaky,’ said a veteran to a youngster 
beside him; ‘but them jobs were a bloomin’ picnic 
compared with this; just pickin’ daisies.’ 
‘Never mind,’ replied ‘Beaky’ gaily; ‘ perhaps 
they ’ll give us two medals for this affair.’ 
‘I reckon a bally pocketful would be dear at the 
price,’ said the reservist, and next moment he fell 
back with a gasping cry. ‘Good-bye, chaps,’ he 
gurgled as the blood spurted from his mouth, 
‘Keep the flag flyin’.’ 
‘Blast ‘em!’ muttered Beaky savagely; and 
gritting his teeth, he took careful aim, and 
brought down a foe with each of his next five 
shots. 
And so it had gone on till past noon, and half 
the division were out of action. But not one foot 
had they given, and time and time again Grenadiers, 
Riflemen, Foot-Guards, and Fusiliers, the pick of 
the German Guard Division, had marched up in 
their thousands, and been hurled back, shattered and 
bleeding. 
‘Those stubborn brutes of English!’ as a German 
General said. ‘By all the rules of the Kriegspiel 
they are defeated, utterly smashed. They are out- 
numbered, outflanked, outmanceuvred, yet they do 
not retire. It is absurd. Fools! They do not 
understand.’ 
Not perhaps as it was understood at Potsdam 
or Berlin. But they understood the glorious old 
British traditions. A fig for ‘war games’! A fig 
for science! A fig for the Germans! Conquer 
or die—that was all the science they cared for.
-P-A-G-E-195
  THE BULLDOG BREED AT BAY. 183 
Calmly, heroically, even with a laugh or a jest, 
they fought on. 
Then the Germans determined to end it once and 
for all, The Cavalry of the Guard, the dlite of the 
army, the finest soldiers in the world, should settle 
it, and Lancers, Hussars, Dragoons, and Cuirassiers, 
in columns of squadrons, a mass of horsemen 
extending as far as the eye could see, came 
proudly on, lance-tip and sword-blade flashing in 
the sun. 
‘Now we sha’n’t be long,’ cried the irrepressible 
Beaky ; ‘cat’s-meat will be cheap ter-morrer, boys.’ 
The regimental officers positively beamed with 
pleasure. Cavalry were going to charge them! 
The wiseacres had said such a thing would never 
happen again; the arme blanche was a thing of the 
past; cavalry charges were done with. But the 
Germans evidently did not think so. 
There had been no chance of entrenching that 
morning. The men had taken what cover they 
could, and had fought the whole day in the open. 
There was no climbing out of trenches. The regi- 
mental officers simply said, ‘Form ranks to receive 
cavalry,’ and mechanically the British infantry 
obeyed. 
In the glorious old British way, front rank kneel- - 
ing, rear rank standing, they waited. Their fathers 
had held the ridge at Balaclava thus; they had 
always conquered, and they would again. 
The Lancashire Fusiliers, Inniskillings, and the 
Essex Regiment were on their right and left. 
‘I never thought I should see such a sight as 
this, Noll,’ cried Vivian, for once roused to excite- 
ment. ‘It’s like a page out of a romance.’
-P-A-G-E-196
184 THE BULLDOG BREED AT BAY. 
‘They ’ll never break us, as long as oak and ash 
grow,’ said Oliver, no less excited. . 
And then came the charge. Shouting their 
‘hochs’ and waving their weapons, the Teutons 
came on, gallantly enough, against those insignifi- 
cant groups of khaki-clad men and boys. Their 
officers had told them they would ride over the 
British ; therefore it would be so.. The only pity 
was that the War Lord himself was not there to 
see their victory. 
Nearer, nearer, the ground trembling beneath 
the iron-shod hoofs, they thundered. The ‘English 
pigs’ had not started to run yet, but they soon 
would. The troopers hoped their prey would not 
run before they could spear or sabre at least one; 
for who could resist them ? 
Then came the disillusionment. 
‘Rapid fire!’ cried the platoon commanders, and 
from the ranks came such a cruel, biting blast that 
the leading ranks of horsemen went down as if 
withered by a devastating wind. Again and again 
the volleys crashed out, no wild, aimless firing from 
the hip, but cool, calm marksmanship that nothing 
could live against. Men and horses fell literally in 
heaps, and such a scene presented itself as the most 
realistic war artist never conceived in his wildest 
dreams. 
Bravely enough the officers led or drove their 
men; gallantly enough the docile German soldiers 
obeyed the commands; but it was of no avail— 
death reaped them in by the hundred. 
Blundering over the bodies of man and horse, 
many of them even reached the bayonets, and then 
those terrible English, positively laughing with glee,
-P-A-G-E-197
  THE BULLDOG BREED AT BAY. 185 
dashed forward and bayoneted the Germans till not 
a living man was before them. 
Broken, they retired, pursued by the pitiless lead ; 
but they re-formed and again charged forward. 
Not with their first dash, though ; they were cowed 
and dazed, and the picked Cavalry of the Guard 
reeled back, looking as though they did not know 
what to do next. 
‘They don’t like their medicine,’ cried Beaky. 
‘I reckon poor old Tompkins is avenged.’ 
‘That’s a plucky chap, anyhow,’ said Vivian to 
Oliver, pointing with his sword to a Hussar officer 
who, heedless of the bullets still flying, was riding 
to and fro trying to rally his scattered men. He 
did, indeed, manage to get some score together ; 
whereupon, an older officer joining him with some 
more men, they formed and charged straight down 
on Oliver’s platoon. 
The rifles mowed them down, but more than a 
dozen managed to get almost up to the line, when, 
the elderly officer’s horse being shot, he came down 
a regular purler. 
At once the young officer who had rallied the 
men jumped off his own horse and offered it to his 
superior, who clambered into the saddle, and, with- 
out a word of thanks, turned and galloped off, being 
followed by the derisive laughter of the British 
soldiers, 
The young officer, sword in one hand and pistol 
in the other, shouted out to the men to follow, 
and then dashed straight forward. A score of shots 
rang out, and most of the Germans bit the dust. 
Amongst them was the young officer, apparently 
shot ; but he jumped to his feet, having really been 
 
-P-A-G-E-198
186 THE BULLDOG BREED AT BAY. 
knocked down by a falling horse. Followed by 
one man only, he ran forward, when Beaky, car- 
ried away with enthusiasm, dashed out and shot 
the solitary mounted Hussar, and then made for the 
officer. The latter pointed his pistol and pulled the 
trigger; but the weapon was empty. He parried 
the bayonet-thrust with his sword, but overreached, 
slipped, and fell heavily to the ground. Beaky 
shortened his bayonet to finish his work ; whereupon 
Vivian shouted out, ‘Don’t hurt him; he’s a gallant 
fellow, anyway.’ 
The officer’s busby had fallen off; and Oliver, an 
excited spectator, to his surprise recognised his friend 
Von Lenz. ‘Ludwig! Ludwig!’ he shouted ; ‘ throw 
down your sword, or you'll be killed !’ 
Ludwig von Lenz looked about him, a trifle 
dazed, for his fall had been a heavy one. Beaky 
still stood with his bayonet ready to strike at a 
word, but Oliver dashed out and seized Von Lenz’s 
hand, from which his sword still hung by the 
sword-knot. 
‘Surrender, Ludwig!’ he said. ‘You saved me 
in Frankfort ; let me befriend you now.’ 
‘Hastings!’ said Ludwig, in great surprise. 
‘Well, I’m glad you got away from Dous.’ 
He stood for a moment, till the captain of 
Vivian’s company came up to them. ‘Let him go,’ 
he whispered ; ‘we don’t want any prisoners.’ 
‘Go, Ludwig,’ said Oliver; ‘you are free.’ 
The young German looked still more astonished ; 
then, catching up his sword, he saluted as he would 
have done his superior officer, and saying, ‘The 
English are gallant foes,’ turned and walked slowly 
away.
-P-A-G-E-199
THE BULLDOG BREED AT BAY. 187 
The men, quick to recognise and admire bravery 
in a foe, and with that appreciation for playing the 
game which is their characteristic, gave the young 
officer a rousing cheer. Again he turned and 
saluted; then he walked off again, and was soon 
lost amongst his retreating comrades. 
‘Upon my word! a sporting German,’ said 
Vivian. ‘I did not know the nation had any.’ 
‘It was Von Lenz, who gave me the tip in 
Frankfort to clear out,’ said Oliver. 
‘Then good luck to him, and may he come safely 
through the day.’ 
A lull followed the abortive cavalry attack. It 
almost seemed as if the Germans had felt so sure 
that their Guards would ride the British down that 
the possibility of failure had never occurred to them, 
and when it happened they did not for a time 
know what to do. 
Then Von Kluck apparently lost his temper, and 
after subjecting the devoted 4th Division to a half- 
hour’s shelling from all his available guns, he hurled 
forward every man he could press into the firing- 
line. 
Heroes all, as every Briton among them was, 
it became clear that if help did not come soon, not 
a man of them could hope to leave the field alive. 
Terrific as had been the punishment dealt out to 
the enemy, their own losses had been very heavy ; 
but with dogged obstinacy they set their teeth, 
those men of the bulldog breed, and made up their 
minds to die fighting, game to the last. 
‘It almost looks as if this is the end,’ said Oliver, 
as, utterly spent, he threw himself on the ground 
for a moment's rest after repelling a violent attack. 
   
-P-A-G-E-200
ee 
188 THE BULLDOG BREED AT BAY. 
‘For us it may be,’ replied Vivian gravely, ‘but 
others will come ; we shall be avenged, and Germany 
will be crushed.’ 
‘I’d rather have done some of the crushing,’ 
replied Oliver; and then another horde was seen 
advancing. ? 
‘ The men again filled their magazines and waited 
grimly. Oliver was watching, when a hot, searing 
pain shot through his head, and he felt himself 
falling. Darkness descended upon him; and when 
he recovered some minutes later he found Vivian 
bending over him, supporting his head. 
‘What’s happened ? What’s the matter ?’ asked 
Oliver, struggling to rise. : 
‘Lie still, old chap. A bullet grazed the top of 
your head, and knocked you out for a few minutes.’ 
Oliver put up his hand, and felt it sticky with 
blood. ‘By Jove!’ he muttered ; ‘a near thing.’ 
‘Very; but you’ll soon be better. Lie still a 
few minutes.’ And Oliver, despite himself, had to 
do so, while another furious attack was repelled. 
Then an R.A.M.C. man came along, and, despite 
Oliver's remonstrances, assisted him away to the 
rear, where his head was bandaged, a big drink 
given him, and he felt only a slight dizziness. 
Getting away from the doctor’s hands, he started 
' off, when a voice called out, ‘Hi, young sir, where 
are you off to ?’ 
Looking round, Oliver saw General Smith Dorrien. 
He saluted and replied, ‘I am going back to my 
platoon, sir.’ 
‘You look a bit shaky yet; better stop a while.’ 
‘I am quite fit, sir.’ 
‘Every man says he’s fit till he’s absolutely 
 
-P-A-G-E-201
eerie THE BULLDOG BREED AT BAY. 189 
knocked out,’ said the General. ‘It’s the spirit 
that’s carried us through so far. Are you well 
enough to sit a horse, youngster ?’ 
‘Quite, sir.’ 
‘Then take this letter to General Haig, and ask 
him if he can send me any assistance. If he cannot, 
I see nothing but annihilation before us, for I dare 
not attempt to move in face of the German attack, 
and I cannot hold out alone till dark.’ 
Oliver took the letter, again saluted, and an 
orderly giving him a horse, he mounted, and was 
soon galloping away on his errand. Part of the 
way he was under heavy fire, and the shrapnel 
burst over him, while the bullets beat up little 
spurts of dust around him; but he reached his 
destination safely, and delivered his message. 
The 1st Division was, however, almost as hardly 
pressed as was the 4th, and not a man could be 
spared. 
‘Tell Smith Dorrien,’ said General Haig, ‘that I 
can’t move a single man now. Directly I can, 
I will send to his assistance and try to cover his 
retreat; but now it’s impossible. I can barely 
hold my own. I’ll send on to Sir John French 
and tell him how matters are. Meanwhile we must 
hang on.’ 
Oliver started on his return journey. He had 
got about half-way, and was going through a 
small wood, when, on emerging from the trees, 
he came suddenly upon six dismounted German 
cavalrymen, He drew rein, in utter surprise, for 
a moment; whereupon the only officer who was with 
the Germans drew his sword and shouted out to the 
troopers to cut Oliver down. Before any of them  
-P-A-G-E-202
  190 THE BULLDOG BREED AT BAY. 
could move, Oliver whipped out his pistol and fired 
two shots at the officer, killing him on the spot. To 
his utter surprise, the five troopers threw up their 
hands, and one who could speak English cried out, 
‘Give mercy, Herr Offizier ; we surrender.’ 
Hiding his surprise, Oliver said in German, ‘ Throw 
down your weapons.’ 
Astonished at hearing themselves addressed in their 
own language, the men did so, and Oliver continued : 
‘What regiment do you belong to ?’ 
‘The 6th Garde Uhlan Regiment,’ answered the 
spokesman. 
‘What are you doing here ?’ 
‘We retired here after our charge failed. We 
would have surrendered before, but our lieutenant’ 
—and he pointed to the dead officer—‘ would not 
let us. We were going to remain here till dark, 
and then make for our own army.’ 
‘Ha! Let each man lead his horse, and march.’ 
‘Have you no men with you ?’ asked the German 
suddenly ; and it then dawned upon Oliver that the 
Germans thought others were following him. 
‘I have here five bullets,’ he replied, as he slipped 
two more into his automatic pistol; ‘that is one 
each for you. Now, march!’ 
‘Is it true that the English shoot all their 
prisoners, Herr Offizier ?’ 
‘No.’ 
‘Nor cut off their hands ?’ 
‘No.’ 
‘Good!’ and saying to his companions, ‘Lead 
your horses,’ the German took his by the bridle 
and led the way. 
Oliver smiled grimly as he rode in the rear, and
-P-A-G-E-203
THE BULLDOG BREED AT BAY. 19f 
when they came under the German fire the gallant 
Uhlans looked far from comfortable. However, the 
British lines were reached, and much surprise and 
some amusement were evinced when Oliver handed 
over his prisoners and related how he had captured 
them. 
General Smith Dorrien shut his jaws firmly when 
he received Sir Douglas Haig’s reply. ‘Well, we’ll 
do what we can,’ he said; and so the fight went on. 
On his way back to his platoon Oliver overtook 
the remains of a field battery, moving to take up 
a new position. 
‘Hallo, Hastings! been hit?’ asked a voice, and 
Captain Dwyer, tunic undone, face grimed with 
sweat and dirt, held out his hand. 
The gunners were in their shirt-sleeves, shirts 
open at the neck, and many with their caps off. 
Several had head or limbs roughly bandaged, and 
it was clear they had experienced very rough 
handling. 
‘Mine was only a scratch,’ said Oliver, ‘but you 
seem to have suffered.’ 
‘More than half the battery gone; but we’ve 
given the “Square-heads” what for, though they 
outnumber us four to one.’ 
Oliver rode along with the battery, under fire 
the whole time, till the new position was reached. 
‘Prepare for action!’ cried Captain Dwyer; and 
the gunners dismounted. ‘Action front, boys!’ and 
the gunners, mostly youngsters, went at it with a 
will. 
All the teams were short-handed, and Oliver saw 
one shortish gunner, after lifting the trail by him- 
self, trying to carry it round. Captain Dwyer,
-P-A-G-E-204
  ‘192 THE BULLDOG BREED AT BAY. 
whose eyes were everywhere, saw the man’s diffi- 
culty, and was hastening to help him, when Oliver 
slid from his saddle and went to the man’s assist- 
ance first. 
‘Good lad,’ cried Dwyer. ‘I wish you were a 
gunner. Every man’s worth his weight in gold 
just now.’ 
‘I'll take a number, if you like.’ 
‘Hastings, you’re a jewel! We've ori three 
men to this gun, so you must take 4, 5, and 6. 
You must load, set the fuses, and supply the 
ammunition. I’ll lay and fire.’ 
The wagons came up, and they opened fire on 
the German batteries which were shelling the 
infantry. For an hour they worked under a heavy 
fire, and by then there were hardly enough men 
to work thé guns, though Dwyer himself seemed to 
bear a charmed life. 
While they were still at work a staff officer with 
i foam-flecked horse galloped up to General Smith 
Dorrien. ‘Sir John says you must retreat, Sir 
Horace,’ he said, ‘or you will be annihilated. The 
cavalry and artillery must cover the retirement.’ 
The General shrugged his shoulders. ‘I'll do 
my best,’ he said; ‘though I hardly dare hope to 
succeed,’ 
The cavalry, perilously few, were moved forward ; 
the artillery, fearfully outnumbered, were told they 
must hold on; and then the infantry gradually fell 
back, but always with their faces to the foe. Directly 
the Germans saw the British commencing to move, 
they hurled every available man forward to crush 
them. But the British cavalry, with devoted in- 
trepidity, charged again and again, the guns were
-P-A-G-E-205
THE BULLDOG BREED AT BAY. 193 
worked till they were almost red-hot, and the 
Germans were held while the infantry fell back, 
the guns and cavalry slowly following. 
All day the flower of the German Army had been 
hurled upon the 4th Division, but it had been 
smashed at every point. Thrown back again and 
again with fearful losses, though they held on to 
the pursuit, the Germans would not come to close 
quarters. They were like hounds following a 
wounded stag, yelping and snapping around, but 
kept at a distance by a wholesome fear of horns 
and hoofs. 
Three of Captain Dwyer’s guns had been put 
out of action before the British retired, and every 
half-mile or so his men halted with the remainder 
and sent in a few rounds. Towards dusk the German 
pressure decreased, and heavy firing was heard, as 
though the enemy was freshly engaged. Then the 
welcome news was spread. At last the French had 
arrived, just in the nick of time, and bravely did they _ 
perform their task of covering their allies’ retreat. 
They seemed determined to emulate the gallantry of 
the Britons, and the Germans had to reckon seriously 
with them during the rest of the retreat. 
As the sun set fiery-red on that day, so glorious 
to British arms, the 4th Division dragged itself 
wearily but defiantly southward. Far into the 
night it kept on, but Oliver had no clear recol- 
lection of anything, except of several times falling 
asleep in his saddle, and at last pitching head- 
foremost to the ground. Then came a halt, and, 
utterly exhausted, he sank into a deep, dreamless 
slumber.

CHAPTER XXIL 
OLIVER REPORTS HIMSELF FOR DUTY. 
EXT morning Oliver was awakened by a feeling 
of chilliness, and found he had been drenched 
to the skin by a heavy thunderstorm. The gunners, 
amongst whom he had lain down, were bustling 
about, seeing to the wants of their horses before 
attending to their own. There were not very many 
of them; the majority were lying away back on 
the two positions they had so gallantly defended, 
and though in the heart of many a sturdy lad there 
was a tear of sadness for the chum who had ‘ gone 
out,’ he wasn’t going to show it, and every one 
whistled and sang as he worked. 
Oliver had an idea of looking for Vivian, as he 
was anxious to know whether he had come safely 
‘through the last attacks; but Captain Dwyer said 
it would be of little use trying to find individual 
regiments in that press. 
‘Besides, you’re too good a gunner to be spared,’ 
he said. ‘I shall want every man to-day, for 
“persistent Hans” is sure to come up for more 
medicine.’ 
And so it proved. All through that day and the 
next the retreat was continued, and the guns and the 
cavalry were continually engaged, guarding the rear. 
But the attacks had become noticeably weaker ; 
there was no dash, no eagerness. The Germans 
were almost as exhausted as were the British ; and, 
besides, they had also to cope with a French army
-P-A-G-E-207
OLIVER REPORTS HIMSELF FOR DUTY. 195 
that was determined to share every danger to which 
the British were exposed. 
The German Army was being cured of its swollen 
head, and the process was unpleasant. The idea 
that it could wipe out ‘French’s contemptible little 
army’ was exploded. For four days it had 
striven with might and main to do so, but had 
been hurled back with appalling loss, It was all 
wrong, it was all silly, argued the Germans; the 
British Army was irretrievably beaten ; the remnant 
ought to surrender. Their officers said so, and it 
must be right. But the British did not know when 
they were beaten, which only proved them to be 
ignorant of all the rules of war. 
The bald-headed generals and spectacled lieutenants 
of the General Staff were chock-full of theory ; they 
had worked everything out down to the exact length 
the men’s hair should be on active service, and they 
knew precisely what would happen under any given 
circumstances. They also knew to a man how many 
were required to perform any given task. It was 
simply a question of numbers. ‘They were the most 
scientific officers in the world, and their men were 
the finest soldiers. Therefore it was all so simple. 
They knew the numbers of the British; their spies 
kept them well informed on every point. It required 
so many Germans to crush them, and these had 
been sent. Not succeeding, they had doubled, 
trebled, then quadrupled the numbers; but the 
fools of English would not play the game properly, 
the problem did not work out to the correct answer, 
and, worse still, an appalling number of stiff-necked, 
budding young Moltkes had paid for their ideas 
with their lives. The rank and file did not matter 
 
-P-A-G-E-208
ie.   196 OLIVER REPORTS HIMSELF FOR DUTY. 
—they were ‘cannon-fodder;’ but these brutes of 
British killed officer and man alike. Ah, they 
should pay for it! 
In spite of their reasoning, however, doubt began 
to creep into the Teutonic mind; those braggart 
Englishmen, those hireling soldiers, they were ter- 
rible fighters! Von Kluck recognised that fact, 
and greater caution was observed. 
The truth was that the German mind, never able 
to see a thing from any standpoint but its own, had 
been utterly unable to estimate the British character, 
had been lamentably incompetent to realise the 
fighting value of the British soldier. The German 
Staff had pooh-poohed at his victories all over the 
world. The Spanish and Portuguese had conquered 
in the Peninsular War; the French had won the 
Crimean War; the other victories of the British 
Army had been gained against unarmed savages or 
ignorant farmers. They only hoped that one day 
the British Army would meet the German Army ; 
then they would see. They had seen, and the result 
had been disastrous to Teutonic complacency. 
The German Army was composed of bombastic, 
theoretic amateurs; the British, of highly trained 
professional soldiers. And when the professional 
meets the amateur, the result is a foregone conclusion. 
There were but a few old men serving with the 
Germans who had ever seen any real service, and 
the conditions of 1870 were as far removed from 
those of 1914 as the equator from the poles. On 
the other hand, in the British Army were thousands 
who had fought in from one to three or four 
campaigns; they had proved the value of the 
yarious theories of war, and had added to their
-P-A-G-E-209
  
OLIVER REPORTS HIMSELF FOR DUTY. 197 
theory a lifetime of actual experience. The result 
was that in the retreat from Mons the Germans 
were outmanceuvred, outclassed, and outfought ; the 
great Prussian war-bubble was burst; Prussian 
prestige was shattered, Prussian moral destroyed. 
The British Army proved its superiority in every 
branch. Its guns smashed the German batteries ; 
its cavalry overthrew the German horse ; its infantry 
hit whatever it aimed at, and with the bayonet 
drove the Huns before it; while its aeroplanes 
hunted the Germans from the air. The British 
gained a moral ascendancy, which during the rest 
of the campaign they never lost. 
Thus it was that after that memorable 26th 
August, though the British Army was still in danger 
from Von Kluck’s persistent efforts to outflank its 
left wing, there was no doubt as to the final issue. 
Heavy fighting there was, but the Germans had 
learnt caution, and kept at a respectful distance 
from the ‘contemptible’ British, 
‘It’s been a near thing,’ said Captain Dwyer as 
he rode along beside Oliver two days later, ‘but I 
knew the boys would pull through; and when we 
turn on the beggars, they ll rush back again as 
fast as they ’ve advanced.’ 
‘But when will that be?’ asked Oliver, whose 
wound was rapidly healing. 
‘When our Chief thinks the right moment has 
arrived, or perhaps when the “Monsieurs” are 
ready. Anyhow, come it will.’ 
‘We’re getting dangerously near to Paris, though.’ 
‘The Deutschers will never enter the gay city,’ said 
Dwyer confidently. ‘It’s my opinion we ’re drawing 
them on for a purpose ; then—well—we shall see.’  
-P-A-G-E-210
ie 198 OLIVER REPORTS HIMSELF FOR DUTY. 
But that day the German pressure seemed to in- 
crease, and the rear-guard actions grew much fiercer. 
While the guns were limbering up after having 
had a tough duel with the enemy, a staff officer 
rode up to Oliver. ‘Do you happen to know where 
the Coldstreams are ?’ he asked. 
‘No; I wish I did. I served with them for 
some days, and I’ve been trying to find them. I’m 
anxious to know whether a very special chum of 
mine has come through so far.’ 
‘I’m looking for Lieutenant Hastings. Did you 
happen to run across him while you were with the 
Coldstreams ?’ 
‘Many times. I am Hastings.’ 
‘That saves me a farther hunt, then. You’ve 
been reported “missing,” and I’ve been sent to make 
inquiries, and, if I find you, to give you this note 
to the colonel of the 12th Lancers, You’re to join 
them for duty at once, as Sir John strongly objects 
to officers serving with any but their own units.’ 
‘I’m sorry, and hope I have not transgressed 
deeply. I'll report myself at once.’ 
He and the staff officer explained to. Captain 
Dwyer, and then Oliver went off to find his regi- 
ment, which was also acting with the rear-guard. 
The cavalry brigades were away to the left, and 
_ Oliver soon found them. Riding up to a Lancer 
~ regiment, he found they were the 9th, and learnt 
that the 12th, with the Scots Greys, were in the 
rear, with the guns. 
The enemy was again pressing forward, and a 
sharp skirmish was in progress, The cavalry and 
horse-artillery had held off the enemy for some 
time, but the skirmish threatened to develop into a 
e 
 
-P-A-G-E-211
OLIVER REPORTS HIMSELF FOR DUTY. 199 
serious engagement, and the mounted men fell back 
upon the rearmost infantry regiment for support. 
This happened to be the Royal Highlanders, better 
known as the Black Watch, and they promptly 
threw themselves on the ground and opened a heavy 
fire on the German Guard cavalry. 
Although they emptied many a score of saddles 
and caused great confusion amongst the enemy, it 
soon became apparent that the Germans meant 
charging, in order to try to capture the guns and 
cut off the cavalry. 
Oliver had ridden up to another Lancer regiment, 
and saw by their shoulder-badges that they were the 
12th. It was no use trying to speak to the colonel 
just then, as he was busy, with his second in com- 
mand, watching the Germans, 
Excitement reigned in the ranks, for it was hoped 
they were going to be given a chance ‘to get home’ 
amongst the enemy. Nor were they to be dis- 
appointed, for in a few minutes an aide-de-camp 
from General Chetwode came galloping up to say 
that the 12th Lancers were to charge the enemy, 
and that the Scots Greys would support them. 
The colonel, his face beaming with pleasure, faced 
his regiment. ‘Twelfth Lancers,’ he cried, ‘you ’re 
going to realise the wish that lives in every cavalry- 
man’s heart. You’re going to charge hostile cavalry. 
Show the Germans to-day what stuff the 12th are 
made of, and make me proud of my boys.’ 
A deep, rolling cheer rang out, and then the 
ranks were dressed, and the officers of the leading 
squadron took post in front. 
Oliver pushed in towards the centre, and in the 
excitement no one noticed him,   
 
-P-A-G-E-212
200 OLIVER REPORTS HIMSELF FOR DUTY. 
The enemy, in dense masses, Lancers, Hussars, 
and Cuirassiers, were moving forward, and the 
colonel of the 12th, turning round, said to his men, 
‘Take your pace from me; don’t blow your horses. 
There will be no bugle-sounding, but when I wave 
my sword, spur on and give ’em the lance.’ 
Oliver turned round as the colonel spoke, and 
saw the long line of clean-cut brown faces, the 
compressed lips, and the keen looks, and knew those 
men would charge home, as fearlessly as did the 
immortal Light Brigade along the grassy valley of 
Balaclava. 
Not one whit behind were the German Cuirassiers, 
who, in their eagle-topped silver helmets, looked 
formidable foes. Big men on big horses they were, 
and in a well-dressed line they came swooping down 
towards the Lancers. 
The colonel increased his pace to a trot; and 
his trumpeter, quite a boy, remembering his chief’s 
words that there would be no ‘ bugle-sounding,’ with 
a grin dropped his instrument and drew his sword, 
determined to ‘do his bit in the charge.’ 
At a hundred paces the colonel dug in his spurs 
and waved his sword. ‘Now, boys, let ’em have it,’ 
he cried; and breaking into a gallop, the regiment 
swept forward, uttering rousing cheers as they 
gripped lance and bridle. 
Oliver gave no thought to the foe in front as 
he raced forward; his only fear was lest his horse 
might stumble and he be pounded out of all 
semblance of humanity by the iron-shod hoofs 
thundering behind him. Then he fixed his eyes 
on the enemy, and found himself noticing the trivial 
circumstance that their swords leoked longer and 
 
-P-A-G-E-213
OLIVER REPORTS HIMSELF FOR DUTY. 201 
straighter than the British weapons, and that they 
still wore a loose, long pouch-belt, an article which 
the British cavalry had discarded. 
Then came the shock! With an indescribable, 
dull, thudding crash, men and horses dashed into 
each other. Lance and sword ripped through flesh 
and sinew, and screams and neighs rose above the 
other sounds. ‘Hurrahs’ and ‘hochs’ from the 
victors rang out, and for a few brief seconds weapons 
were plied vigorously. Then the leading German 
squadron was pierced, and the Lancers were dashing 
at the second. This was met, but the conflict was 
fiercer. A great, fair-headed, blue-eyed giant made 
a sweeping cut at Oliver, which the latter received on 
his sword. The force of the blow was broken, but so, 
alas! was the weapon, which broke off at the hilt. 
The German muttered ‘Ach!’ and raised his heavy 
sword again, when a trooper behind Oliver caught 
the German in the throat with his lance. 
‘Try the point next time, old pins!’ he cried, 
alluding to the German’s closely cropped hair, and 
swept on. 
Oliver drew his pistol and followed, just in time 
to see his colonel engaged with two men and an 
officer. He was a fine swordsman, and his blade 
was whirling round his head like a silver streak, 
parrying the strokes aimed at him. Then a fourth 
man joined in and gashed the colonel on the chin, 
when the others would quickly have made an end 
of him, had not Oliver shot two with his pistol, and 
a trooper cut down the third. 
‘Thanks, youngster,’ cried the colonel, ignoring 
his wound; then, looking round, he shouted, 
‘Trumpeter—trumpeter, sound the rally !’ 
 
-P-A-G-E-214
  202 OLIVER REPORTS HIMSELF FOR DUTY. 
At that moment the combat had resolved itself 
into a series of hand-to-hand conflicts, but whereas 
the blood of the British was up and they fought 
like tigers, the Germans, as ever, directly they were 
broken, seemed to lose all cohesion, and were offering 
but a faint resistance, ‘being slaughtered like pigs 
and squealing as sech, as a trooper afterwards 
graphically put it. 
Being for a moment freed from adversaries, Oliver 
looked to his left, and saw a sight which stirred his 
blood. 
The Scots Greys, their fine horses stretching their 
necks, were racing at the Hussars in front of them. 
The Greys rode in a crouching position, swords and 
lances well advanced; but, wonder of wonders, 
hanging on to the stirrups of the Greys were men 
of the Black Watch. Emulating the example of 
their forebears at Waterloo, the Highlanders dashed 
into the fight with the cavalry. Just as Oliver saw 
them they met the Germans, and the Hussars seemed 
to crumple up. Utterly unprepared for such an 
event, which had never been dreamt of by the 
learned ones of Cologne or Danzig, they seemed 
flabbergasted, and the Greys cut them down like 
sheep. Loosing the stirrup-leathers directly they 
were in amongst the enemy, the Highlanders at- 
tacked with such fury that in two minutes the 
Hussars seemed dashed into utter confusion, like 
the pieces of an immense jig-saw puzzle. Half the 
regiment turned and fled, the Greys after them, 
the Lancers re-forming to join in the pursuit of the 
Cuirassiers, who had also turned tail. 
Having emptied his pistol and broken his sword, 
Oliver was quite defenceless, but was taking his
-P-A-G-E-215
OLIVER REPORTS HIMSELF FOR DUTY. 203 
place well in front, when a young private, 
noticing his empty scabbard, said, ‘Lost your 
sword, sir ?’” 
‘Smashed in my hand,’ replied Oliver. 
‘Here, take my old iron,’ said the young Lancer, 
drawing his sword and handing it to Oliver; ‘I’ve 
got my lance.’ 
‘But if you should lose that ?’ 
‘Never fear, I sha’n’t lose it; the Germans 
won’t show us much else than their backs now, 
and they ’ll have to be pretty tough to break my 
old ash-pole.’ 
Word was given to pursue, and away they went 
at the gallop, Oliver joyfully gripping the trooper’s 
heavy sword. 
The other cavalry, farther along the line, had 
met. with equal success, and the whole of the 
German force was in flight. The victorious British 
followed them for three miles, spearing and sabring 
them in scores, until the bugles sounded the recall, 
and the: troopers, weary with smiting, reined in 
their foam-flecked horses, and at a walk returned 
to their starting-place. 
Greys and Lancers cheered each other lustily, 
and some wag in the Lancers starting a song which 
began, ‘I never stopped running till I got home,’ 
dozens joined in. 
Such is the mettle of our soldiers in France. 
The charge of the cavalry effectually cooled the 
ardour of the Germans. After the regiment was 
re-formed, Oliver was riding down the ranks looking 
for the young private who ‘had lent him the sword, 
when he met the colonel face to face, and immedi- 
ately ‘carried swords.’ 
 
-P-A-G-E-216
204 OLIVER REPORTS HIMSELF FOR DUTY. 
‘Hallo, young sir! what are you doing?’ asked 
the colonel, who had a great patch of sticking- 
plaster on his chin. 
‘I am going to return this sword, sir,’ replied 
Oliver; and he explained how he came to borrow it. 
The colonel smiled and said, ‘All right; but how 
came you to be with us ?’ 
‘If you please, sir, I came to report for duty ;’ 
and taking from his tunic the letter the staff officer 
had given him, then somewhat crumpled, Oliver 
handed it over. 
The colonel read it, and burst out laughing. 
‘This is a campaign of surprises,’ he said. ‘It 
seems the way a second lieutenant joins is first to 
charge home with the regiment, incidentally save 
his colonel’s life, then calmly report himself for 
duty. Well, young sir, you are welcome. But tell 
me, are you any relation to Colonel Arthur Hastings 
of the Sixteenth ?’ ' 
‘He is my father, sir.’ 
‘Then doubly welcome, for your father is one of 
my most valued friends. He was captain of my 
troop when I joined as a subaltern, and we served 
together till I was transferred on promotion to 
major. Is he out here ?’ 
‘I don’t know, sir. I haven’t seen him since 
July.’ 
‘Well, the first ten minutes’ spare time I get I 
must find you and get all the news. For the 
present, welcome to the Twelfth;’ and the colonel 
shook hands with Oliver and rode on. 
Oliver returned the sword to the trooper, with 
half-a-sovereign for its loan, and then they had 
once more to be on the move.
-P-A-G-E-217
  OLIVER REPORTS HIMSELF FOR DUTY. 205 
That night they were comparatively undisturbed, 
and accommodation was found for the officers in a 
fine old chateau. A very passable meal was pre- 
pared, and the colonel introduced Oliver to his 
brother-officers, who, he found, were a very nice 
lot of fellows. 
He was pressed to give an outline of his adven- 
tures, his Belgian experiences being listened to with 
especial eagerness. After supper, when the toast of 
the King and the regiment had been honoured, the 
colonel rose to his feet and said, ‘Gentlemen, we 
must break up very shortly, as we all have pressing 
duties to attend to. But before we go I have a 
little tale to tell you;’ and then, to Oliver’s em- 
barrassment, he related how Oliver had first saved 
his life, and then how he had met him riding to 
return the borrowed sword. ‘He then calmly told 
me he wanted to report himself for duty,’ the colonel 
said. When the laugh had died down, the colonel 
continued: ‘It is just such youngsters that the 
Twelfth want, and which, thank God ! every regiment 
in our army has got.—Now, Mr Hastings, when I 
came out I took the trouble to provide myself with 
two swords, and, as a little memento of to-day’s 
work, I want to ask your acceptance of one of 
them.’ 
A mess-servant handing him a handsome weapon, 
the colonel took it and placed it in Oliver’s hands. 
‘Wear it and use it well,’ he said; ‘and I know 
from what I have seen to-day, and from the 
affection and respect I have for your father, that 
it could not be in better hands.’ 
‘Hear! hear! Hurrah! hurrah!’ cried the 
officers assembled; and some one starting ‘For
-P-A-G-E-218
206 OLIVER REPORTS HIMSELF FOR DUTY. 
he’s a Jolly Good Fellow,’ the light-hearted fellows 
sang it lustily. 
Blushing fiery-red with pleasure, Oliver acknow- 
ledged the gift in a few well-chosen words, and 
then the party broke up, to snatch a few hours’ 
sleep before they must once more be on_ the 
move.

CHAPTER XXII 
CAPTURING THE GUNS. 
¢ M* long-lost: chee-ild, do I indeed behold thee ?’ 
It was on the following day, while Oliver 
was standing talking with several brother-officers, 
that the above words in a well-known voice fell 
upon his ear. He looked up and saw Vivian, and 
in an instant their hands were clasped in a firm grip. 
‘My dear Vivian, I’ve been simply dying to see 
you. I heard last night you were all right so far, 
but I’ve been in a rare fidget.’ 
‘Damon and Phintias,’ smiled one of Oliver's 
brother-officers ; ‘the long-lost hero found.’ 
Oliver and Vivian, with the outward coldness of 
the average Britons, after that first hand-grip, joined 
in the ordinary conversation; but presently they 
went off together, and Vivian, drawing Oliver’s arm 
through his own, said fervently, ‘Thank God, old 
boy, you’re all right! I’ve never been able to get 
out of my mind the recollection of your white face, 
topped by a blood-stained bandage, when you were 
helped from the firing- line. You’ve been reported 
wounded and missing since then, you know, and I 
feared for the worst.’ 
Oliver looked in surprise at his friend, for Vivian 
was, as a rule, so coolly matter-of-fact that he did 
not realise the affection which lay beneath the ap- 
parently careless exterior. For a moment they 
gazed into one another’s eyes, and the soul of each 
seemed to shine out. Another silent hand-grip, and
-P-A-G-E-220
  208 CAPTURING THE GUNS. 
Oliver said, ‘I too have been much worried, Vivian, 
for I knew your chaps were in the thick of it and 
your losses heavy.’ ; 
Not another word was said, but each read the 
other’s heart. As long as life lasted, so would their 
friendship. ' 
The Guards Brigade had joined the 5th Cavalry 
Brigade, and so during the next three days, which 
were days of almost continuous fighting, Oliver and 
Vivian frequently met. 
On the memorable 1st September the Guards and 
5th Cavalry Brigade, still covering the rear, were 
near the lovely forest of Compidgne. Oliver's regi- 
ment being close to Vivian’s, they met soon after 
dawn. 
‘Happy month, Vivian !’ cried Oliver. 
‘Same to you, old dear! What a day for the 
partridges! If we were only at home, now, I expect 
most of us would be busy with shooting of a different 
kind.’ 
“Yes; smaller game than the Germans, and not 
such exciting sport.’ 
‘The sport seems slackening a bit, Noll, my boy. 
Old “Von o’Clock,” as our boys have nicknamed 
him, is not quite so pressing in his attentions as he 
was.’ 
Hardly had the words passed Vivian’s lips when 
the roar of guns burst out from their right, where, 
concealed by the trees, a German battery had crept 
up during the darkness, unperceived. The shells 
dropped right in amongst his regiment, many of 
whom were down on the river-bank enjoying a good 
wash. 
‘They ’ve caught us napping,’ cried Vivian, as the
-P-A-G-E-221
i a i a a ae 
CAPTURING THE GUNS. 209 
bugles rang out the alarm. ‘Take care of yourself, 
Oliver ;’ and with a hand-shake they parted, each 
going to his regiment. 
Every man armed and ran to his rallying-point, 
and in five minutes all were ready; but in that 
short time’ the Germans had wrought considerable 
damage. 
Captain Dwyer’s battery, with Oliver’s regiment 
as support, went swinging along, and soon they were 
pumping in shells as hard as they could in the 
direction whence came the German fire. Presently 
they saw the German cavalry, in great strength, ad- 
vancing. When they got within range, the Guards 
Brigade, which had hurried after the cavalry, opened 
fire, and saddles were emptied in fine style, scatter- 
ing the Germans. But their artillery kept working 
up. closer and closer, and it was clear that a very 
serious attack was about to be made. 
Dark clouds of infantry appeared on the sky-line, 
and a furious battle was soon in progress. 
The British guns were finely served, but they 
were sadly outnumbered, and after the action had 
lasted a couple of hours a retirement was ordered. 
Fresh hordes of Germans came on, and things 
looked serious for the British, The retreat was 
towards a well-wooded hill, and the Germans, divin- 
ing the object of the British, raced forward their 
cavalry and horse-artillery, reaching the objective 
first. They took up a strong position, and directing 
their fire on the British batteries, silenced several of 
the guns. Battalions of infantry were rushed up 
on motor-lorries, and these opened a terrific fire, 
while clouds of cavalry swept down on the British 
guns. 
KK, N 
 
-P-A-G-E-222
210 CAPTURING THE GUNS. 
The Guards Brigade, seeing the danger, leapt to 
their feet, and the senior colonel, drawing his sword, 
cried, ‘Guardsmen, the guns are in danger! They ’ve 
saved us many a time; let us save them. Follow 
me!’ 
With magnificent intrepidity the gallant Guards- 
men advanced to get between the guns and the 
German cavalry. Seeing this, the latter increased 
their pace. But the Irish Guards, racing forward, 
threw themselves in the path of the Germans. 
To Oliver, who was an excited spectator, the 
shock seemed terrific, for the Germans charged home 
straight enough. 
The whole force of infantry and cavalry were 
mixed up in a confused heap, but the Irishmen stood 
fast. The crack of rifles resounded, and Oliver saw 
the German horses impaled on the dreaded bayonet. 
All the while the German and British guns were 
shelling round the fringes of the fight, and presently 
the German cavalry was seen to recoil, and then to 
turn and gallop away from those furious Guardsmen. 
Two other strong regiments, however, were moving 
forward, and the Coldstreams, advancing at the 
double in turn, went to meet them, while the Irish 
re-formed. Again there came a terrific shock, and 
Oliver trembled for Vivian. 
Then the 9th Lancers joining Oliver’s regiment, 
the two were ordered to charge down to the assist- 
ance of the Guards. 
‘Now, Hastings, said Oliver’s captain, ‘let’s give 
the Huns a lesson ;’ and soon they were thundering 
forward. 
They made a detour so as to get in on the flank 
of the enemy, and a regiment of Uhlans was de-
-P-A-G-E-223
CAPTURING THE GUNS. 211 
tached to meet them. As they got close, Oliver saw 
by the uniform that it was Dous’s regiment, and he 
gripped his sword fiercely, hoping he might meet his 
enemy in fair fight. With a ringing cheer the 
British Lancers charged, and a sanguinary fight took 
place, for the Germans saw victory within their 
grasp. But the British were not to be denied, and _ 
though many a saddle was emptied, they hurled the 
Uhlans back. Wheeling to their left, they re-formed 
and charged in to the relief of the Guards, who were 
still waging a hot fight. 
Soon an indescribable scene was being enacted. 
Coldstreams and Grenadiers, Lancers and Hussars, 
were fighting hand-to-hand with the German cavalry, 
and a combat took place similar to a battle of the 
Middle Ages. 
Rifle-butt and bayonet opposed sword and lance, 
and Oliver cut and parried, thrust and stabbed, till 
his arm ached and his brain whirled. With a few 
troopers he rode towards a little group of Guards- 
men who were defending themselves against great 
odds. An officer was encouraging them by word 
and example to resist. 
‘Never give way before German dogs, my men,’ 
he cried. ‘Give ‘em the steel; they can’t stand 
that.’ 
Oliver recognised Vivian’s voice, and calling to his 
men to follow, charged down at the German Hussars. 
He cut one man clean out of his saddle, and gave 
another the point, when he saw Vivian stagger under 
a violent blow which seemed to cut him right down. 
With a wild cry Oliver jumped his horse over a dead 
German, and slashed across the face the man who had 
struck Vivian, A Guardsman shot two others; and 
 
-P-A-G-E-224
212 CAPTURING THE GUNS. 
then, more Lancers coming up, the pressure was re- 
lieved, and the Germans fell back a little. In an 
instant Oliver was out of his saddle and had raised 
Vivian’s head. His eyes were closed and he looked 
as if dead. 
‘Give me a hand,’ cried Oliver to a Guardsman ; 
and when he had climbed back into his saddle, a 
soldier, himself bleeding from a wound in the neck, 
picked up Vivian and placed him in front of Oliver. 
Hardly had he done so when a fresh body of 
Germans came charging down, and Oliver, gritting 
his teeth with rage, rode straight at them. Several 
of his men followed, and they cut their way through ; 
whereupon Oliver galloped off to the rear, where he 
handed Vivian over to the doctor who was giving 
first dressing. 
‘Is he dead? Oh, is he dead, doctor?’ asked 
Oliver, in anguish. 
The doctor turned back Vivian’s eyelids, and 
placed his hand over the young officer’s heart. 
‘Where was he hurt ?’ he asked. 
‘I saw him cut on the head, I think.’ 
The doctor placed his hand on a great lump. 
‘Stunned only,’ he said shortly ; ‘he’ll be all right 
directly.’ 
Full of thankfulness, Oliver galloped back to his 
regiment, just as it was forming up for a farther 
advance. He joined his squadron, and noticed that 
his captain was not in his place. Inquiry from a 
sergeant elicited the reply that he had been killed 
by a splinter of shell. 
‘Our guns are threatened,’ added the sergeant ; 
‘we’re going at once to their support.’ 
And away they went. The guns were on their
-P-A-G-E-225
CAPTURING THE GUNS. 213 
left, and by the tremendous shouting they knew 
something serious was happening. There was no 
sound of firing, and when the Lancers came in sight, 
to their horror they saw the guns were surrounded 
by swarms of German cavalry, who were cutting 
and slashing at a few gunners who remained alive. 
Numbers of German infantry were rushing forward 
to help in dragging away the captured guns, for 
that they were captured there could be no doubt. 
The Germans to capture a Royal Horse. battery, 
the braided gunners, the Right of the British Line! 
It could not be borne: 
‘Men,’ cried the colonel of the 9th Lancers, ‘we 
must retake those guns. Follow me;’ and with 
another rousing cheer the remains of the two regi- 
ments dashed forward. 
The German infantry, seeing them, opened a wild 
fire from the hip, but it did little damage, and soon 
the Lancers were among them, riding them down 
and spearing them almost without resistance. The 
German cavalry, however, had managed to limber up 
the captured guns; but the British troopers spurred 
their horses forward and overtook them, and a 
running fight took place. 
Notwithstanding the Germans’ determined efforts, 
Uhlans and Dragoons were shot or cut down, and 
one by one the guns were recovered. A fat Prussian, 
using a whip which he had picked up on the field, 
was mounted on the wheeler of the foremost gun, 
and was spurring and slashing with might and main. 
It seemed almost as if this gun, at least, would be 
lost, but Oliver determined it should not be. Riding 
lighter than most of his comrades, he outstripped 
them, and drawing his pistol, fired three shots at the
-P-A-G-E-226
214 CAPTURING THE GUNS. 
Prussian, the last of which toppled him from the 
saddle. He fell between the horses, and the wheels 
passed over his body. ‘The other two drivers lashed 
their horses, but Oliver, with another lucky shot, 
brought down the second driver. Then, coming 
abreast of the leader, he seized the reins of the 
maddened horse and tried to pull him up. The 
driver drew his sword and cut at Oliver; but 
the horse giving a lurch, he missed, and Oliver, pre- 
senting his empty pistol at him, bade him sternly 
pull up or he would shoot him. 
The man, astonished at hearing himself addressed 
in his own language, mechanically tugged at the 
reins, and Oliver pulling at the second horse, the 
gun came to a standstill. Oliver’s colonel coming 
up, the Prussian slipped off the leading horse, and 
taking to his heels, bolted for his life. 
‘Well done, young man!’ cried the colonel. 
‘You'll soon be figuring in despatches if you go 
on like this.’ 
Lancers jumped into the drivers’ saddles, and, in 
a way that would have made artillerymen weep in 
peace-time, the guns were wheeled and brought 
triumphantly back. 
The few horse-gunners who had not been killed 
outright, with bandaged heads and limbs, cheered the 
cavalrymen as they returned with the guns, which 
they took over again. 
Oliver noticed a couple of drivers tenderly lifting 
a wounded officer on to a limber, and, to his grief, 
saw it was his old friend Dwyer. 
“Is he dead ?’ he asked anxiously. 
‘No, sir; but he’s got a bad dose. He shot five 
of them German devils with his revolver, and laid

about him with his sword till he was properly 
slashed about the head. He never meant leaving 
the field alive after he saw he couldn’t save the 
guns. Poor captain, he’d die of joy if he knew 
we’d got ’em back;’ and the man lovingly patted 
the chase of the gun. 
All this time they were under a heavy fire. 
Making towards their companions, they saw the 
Germans had fallen back ; but their artillery, taking 
advantage of the cavalry and infantry fight, had 
taken up a new position, and were pouring in a 
positively murderous fire. 
The Guards had suffered very heavily, as had the 
cavalry, but the work was not yet done. The German 
guns had to be silenced if the remnants of that force 
wanted to escape annihilation, and a message came 
from the General that a combined infantry and 
cavalry attack must be made upon them. The in- 
fantry formed in open order, and, with cavalry on 
each flank, they advanced towards the guns, the fire 
from which did great execution. Advancing by 
rushes, one platoon covering another, the infantry 
went forward until the time for a cavalry charge 
came. 
‘Now, boys, one more effort!’ cried Oliver’s 
colonel, ‘The “supple ” Twelfth will not be denied ; 
we must have those guns!’ 
‘Right-o,’ shouted an excited trooper; ‘lead the 
way, colonel ;’ and another man crying out, ‘Are we 
down-hearted ?’ a thunderous ‘No!’ rang out. 
The colonel smiled grimly. No need to fear such 
men failing him. Oliver’s regiment advancing from 
the left flank, the 9th Lancers from the right, they 
swept forward straight at the guns. It was a fear-

216 CAPTURING THE GUNS. 
ful ride. Shrapnel, explosive shell, case-shot ripped 
and tore, blasted and smashed, blowing whole sec- 
tions away; but the grim troopers never faltered. 
The gunners worked their pieces till the last, and 
the Lancers fell upon them like furies, spearing 
them round the guns and limbers. 
In five minutes not an artilleryman was on his 
feet ; the cavalry and infantry supporting the guns 
did not wait for the Lancers to charge them, but 
retired; whereupon the madly excited troopers, dis- 
mounting, limbered up the guns, and again turning 
drivers, drew them off in triumph. 
Twelve guns fell into the hands of the British, 
and their loss was so serious to the Germans that 
they fell back at all points. The British artillery, 
again opening upon them, caused terrible havoc in 
their ranks, and the foe, utterly defeated, retreated 
more rapidly than they had advanced. 
The British losses had been exceedingly heavy, but 
they had beaten off the Germans, remained in pos- 
session of the field, and had captured twelve guns. 
So there was fierce joy among the victors; and 
though the retreat had to be continued, there was a 
grim feeling that once more the Germans had got 
more than they bargained for. 
They retreated across the Oise, blowing up the 
bridges after them, and two days later saw them 
safely across the Marne.

CHAPTER XXIII 
A TRIP IN THE AIR. 
‘ C\LIVER, my boy, have you ever been up in an 
aeroplane ?’ 
‘Good Lord, no, Vivian !’ 
‘What do you say to a trip, with London, say, at 
the other end of it ?’ 
Oliver paused in the act of conveying his fork to 
his mouth, for it was evening, and he had fallen into 
a pretty comfortable billet. That day they had re- 
tired in quite leisurely fashion; it was clearly no 
longer a case of stern necessity, but of strategy. 
The doctor had spoken truly when he pronounced 
Vivian’s hurt trifling, The flat of the German’s 
sword had caught him, and his cap protecting him, 
the only damage done was to knock him senseless 
for an hour, and to raise a discoloured lump as large 
as an egg upon his head. 
Vivian, returning to duty, had been sent for by 
headquarters, and in the evening had dropped in at 
Oliver’s billet, asking the question with which the 
chapter opens. 
Having stared for a moment at his friend, Oliver 
replied, ‘I suppose that bump on your noddle hasn’t 
affected your brain, old chap ?’ 
‘Not in the least. The fact is,’ Vivian continued, 
lowering his voice, ‘Sir John French sent for me to 
ask my opinion on a certain point connected with 
German armaments. He knows, of course, that I 
belong to the §.S., and the result of the interview is
-P-A-G-E-230
    218 A TRIP IN THE AIR. 
that I must go at once to London with a very im- 
portant communication. I hold a pilot’s certificate, 
and elect to go by aeroplane, both for swiftness and 
safety. I have carte blanche to take any one I like 
with me, and naturally I come to you.’ 
‘A trip to London,’ said Oliver, his face flushing 
at the very thought; ‘should I not like it!’ 
‘We start in an hour or so.’ 
‘But in an aeroplane. I say, old chap, I should 
die of funk.’ 
‘And I dare say as easy a death as one from a 
German shell-splinter,’ said Vivian coolly. 
‘No, but really ’ 
“Well ?’ 
‘I’m afraid, and that’s a fact.’ 
‘And so was I when I first went up. It’s an 
acquired taste, this flying, like eating oysters with 
jam. After a time you'll love it.’ 
‘But what am I to do for clothes? I couldn’t 
dare show up in civilised society in these.’ 
‘An earcap and a mackintosh will be provided, 
and these will disguise you from your bitterest foe. 
I will call for you as soon as my preparations are 
complete. Meanwhile, get leave from your colonel, 
and be ready.’ 
And so it came to pass that in the late afternoon 
Oliver and Vivian were seated in a B.E, Army 
biplane, fitted with 60 h.p, engines, while half-a- 
dozen men of the Flying Corps stood by to hold 
on, Vivian had made a thorough inspection before 
he took his place, and gripping his starting-lever, 
he called out, ‘ All clear ?’ 
‘ All clear, sir.’ 
‘Look out, then.’  
-P-A-G-E-231
A TRIP IN THE AIR. 219 
The great propeller-blades were given a turn, the 
motor sparked, the propeller whizzed round, and 
the machine ran forward. Then Vivian tilted his 
planes, and, heigh-ho! Oliver gripped the sides of 
his seat, and was almost startled into crying out 
in alarm that the earth was dropping. Then he 
remembered, set his teeth, and found they were 
going up, up; while the noise of the engine was 
deafening. 
For a while Oliver’s sensations were of a varied 
character, amongst which uneasiness certainly pre- 
dominated ; but when Vivian turned round, face all 
smiles, Oliver began to feel a little more comfortable, 
and looked about him. They were high up, and, 
coming from the heat below, Oliver felt decidedly 
chilly. When, having attained an altitude of some 
4000 feet, Vivian straightened his planes and shot 
ahead, the wind whistled by in a very cutting 
manner. Below them lay the country spread out 
like a panorama, but Oliver had but little inclination 
to look down, as he still felt a bit dizzy. So he 
sat very quiet till Vivian cried through the telephone, 
‘The sea, old man.’ 
Oliver looked down at the blue waves, and it 
brought home to him very vividly the recollection 
that they were on their way home, and immediately 
all the horror and bloodshed of the last few days, 
although seared upon his brain indelibly, seemed 
ages ago. 
Oliver felt more secure over the sea, and gazed 
down through his glasses, noticing that a good many 
ships were passing and repassing along that narrow 
neck of blue water—Britain’s natural bulwark. 
Before he realised it they were across the sea 
 
-P-A-G-E-232
220 A TRIP IN THE AIR. 
and flying over the white cliffs of Dover. Vivian 
dipped his planes, they came down to about 500 
feet, and Oliver looked with affection upon the 
sweeping green downs, the cultivated patches, seem- 
ing like squares on a draught-board, and the red- 
roofed farmhouses of picturesque Kent. 
There were great numbers of tents too, around 
which khaki-clad figures were buzzing like ants. 
Heavy trains were speeding towards the coast, but 
otherwise all looked as calm and peaceful as England 
ever does. 
It was not long before the broad Thames, shim- 
mering in the setting sun, was visible upon their 
right, and then ahead was the great bank of smoke 
that overshadows London. Through this they fled 
at a greater altitude, catching occasional glimpses of 
stately buildings and open spaces beneath, and then 
to the country beyond. Just as it was getting 
dark Vivian circled round once or twice, planed 
down, and successfully descended in an aerodrome. 
A score of youngsters in blue uniforms, members 
of the Royal Flying Corps, clung on to the machine 
directly it touched ground, and as it came to a 
standstill Oliver, feeling very cold, clambered out 
after Vivian. An officer approached, and while he 
and Vivian were talking Oliver gazed round, hardly 
able to realise that a few hours before he had been 
in the British lines, face to face with war, and 
feeling as far from England as though he had been 
in Africa. 
Suddenly a hearty cheer broke out ; the youngsters 
had just heard that the two officers. had come 
direct from the front. Smiling and waving their 
hands, Vivian and Oliver passed through the crowd
-P-A-G-E-233
eT A TRIP IN THE AIR. 221 
of admirers, and after a few words with the com- 
mandant, left the aerodrome, and stepped into a 
car which was waiting. 
‘Where the dickens are we, Vivian ?’ asked Oliver 
as they drove off. 
‘Hendon Aerodrome, my boy.’ 
‘And whither bound ?’ 
‘The War Office, with important despatches for 
a certain great personage who shall be nameless.’ 
‘Well, my job is so far done, and I refuse to 
present myself before any one in my present be- 
draggled condition, My father’s house is only a 
mile or two from here; can’t this fellow, drop me 
and take you on into town? He can bring you 
back, and we can put you up until your business 
here is settled.’ 
‘He can drop you where you like, but I cannot 
accept your kind offer. Until I have delivered my 
papers, I cannot say what my movements will be. 
In any case I shall put up at Limmer’s for the | 
night, and will wire you in the morning.’ 
‘Ask the chauffeur, then, if he knows The Hollies 
at St Albans.’ ; 
The man knew it well, and in twenty minutes ul 
had drawn up outside the gates. 
‘Come in for five minutes, Vivian,’ said Oliver. 
‘Sorry, old boy, but I cannot spare the time. 
Run in and give my kind respects to pa, and tell 
ma not to spoil you, as you will be off to the front 
again in a day or two. And now ta-ta till we 
meet again !’ 
The horn gave a toot-toot, there was a flash of 
lamps, and Oliver was alone on the well-remembered 
gravel-drive. He strode up to the house, passed  
-P-A-G-E-234
  222 A TRIP IN THE AIR. 
through the glass swing-doors, and made for his 
father’s den. Opening the door, he softly entered. 
A tall, fine man in uniform was sitting writing at 
a table. Hearing some one enter unbidden, he 
looked up in surprise, taking his cigarette-holder 
from his mouth, 
‘Father,’ said Oliver. 
‘What! Oliver, my boy ?’ cried the elder man, 
and upsetting his chair in his haste, he jumped up 
and took both Oliver’s hands in his, while he gazed 
into his face. ‘My dear, dear boy, this is a surprise ! 
Why didn’t you let me know you were coming ?’ 
‘Five hours ago, father, I had no more idea of 
coming home than you had of seeing me.’ 
Oliver had not entered his father’s house quite 
unseen. A servant had recognised him, a word was 
whispered in the drawing-room, and a rather small 
but handsome lady, followed by several daughters, 
boldly took Colonel Hastings’s sanctum by storm, 
and in a moment Oliver was in his mother’s arms, 
while his sisters hung round him, crying and laugh- 
ing by turns. Hardly had the excitement worn 
down than a little figure in a white night-gown 
peeped round the corner of the door, and, seeing 
Oliver, cried, ‘Oliver! Oliver! He’s come back 
from killing Germans! Hurray!’ and in a moment 
little Herbert was on his big brother’s shoulder, 
asking if he had brought back any German helmets, 
and whether he had an Iron Cross. 
The excitement over, Oliver just stated how it 
was he had managed to get home, and then made 
his request: ‘A hot bath and a change of clothes!’ 
Oh the luxury of that bath, and the cool, refresh- 
ing effect of clean linen !
-P-A-G-E-235
  A TRIP IN THE AIR. 223 
Dinner was over, but a meal was prepared for 
Oliver, and then they all retired to the drawing- 
room, where the boy was asked a hundred and one 
questions. He was ready to talk on any subject 
but the war. Somehow, in that haven of peace, he 
could find no words in which to express what he 
had gone through; it all seemed so terrible, and, 
now that he was again in the bosom of his family, 
so unreal, that he could not talk of it; and after 
he had turned the conversation a dozen times, his 
mother and sisters dropped the subject. 
Later on his father, who had seen a good bit of 
service, said, ‘I suppose it’s been fearful over there, 
Oliver ?’ nodding his head southward. 
‘Too terrible for words, father.’ 
‘H’m, h’m! and it will be worse yet. Have a 
cigarette, my boy ; it’s a campaigner’s privilege.’
-P-A-G-E-236
  CHAPTER XXIV. 
A GLIMPSE OF HEAVEN. 
_ morning the family assembled early round 
the breakfast-table. Oliver had not slept so 
well as he thought he would. It was so quiet, 
there was such an air of peace, the bed was so cool 
and so soft, everything was such a contrast to what 
he had endured for the last month, that he was 
fidgety. 
Little Herbert, who sat beside Oliver, insisted on 
talking of the war, wanted to know how many 
Germans Oliver had killed with his own hand, 
whether he had shot them or cut off their heads, and 
soon. Oliver made joking replies, which led his 
mother and sisters to bring the conversation round 
again to the subject of his experiences; but the 
young soldier avoided replying by asking about 
the theatres and county cricket, and in the end his 
relations gave up the attempt in despair. 
There were a very large number of Territorial 
troops in the neighbourhood of St Albans, and 
Colonel Hastings held an appointment on the com- 
mandant’s staff. 
When he went off in the morning he took Oliver 
with him in his car. The smart appearance and 
soldierly bearing of the troops at once struck Oliver, 
fresh as he was from the midst of the finest troops 
of the regular army. 
Colonel Hastings had some business to transact 
with the commandant, and left Oliver with one or
-P-A-G-E-237
  A GLIMPSE OF HEAVEN, 225 
two officers to whom he had introduced him. When, 
presently, the colonel and Oliver got into the car to 
return, they found a good many youngsters had 
assembled round the commandant’s office. As Oliver 
and his father drove off, these young soldiers waved 
their caps and gave three rousing cheers. Oliver 
looked in surprise at his father, then at the cheering 
soldiers, and at last smiled broadly. ‘I didn’t know 
you were so popular, dad,’ he said. 
The colonel smiled in turn. ‘It’s not me they ’re 
cheering ; it’s you!’ 
‘Me! Why? Are they mad? Who do they 
think I am ?’ 
‘Just one of the heroes of Liége and Mons, I 
expect,’ replied the colonel dryly. ‘I mentioned the 
matter while I was talking to the commandant, and 
that sort of news soon gets about.’ 
“Good heavens, dad! you’ve let me in for some- 
thing,’ said Oliver, blushing fiery-red ; but he raised 
his hand to his cap to the still yelling crowd, and 
said, ‘Get us through this quickly, dad;’ and the 
colonel opened the throttle and away they went. 
It was Oliver's first experience of the enthusiasm 
Britain had for the men who had stopped the Huns’ 
rush, and it made him think for a minute. ‘I 
suppose those who took part in the fighting will 
be a bit popular,’ he said. 
‘They ll be marked men for the rest of their 
lives,’ replied his father; ‘just as those young 
fellows who ought to serve their country, and who, 
from love of ease, selfishness, or whatever other 
reason they hide behind, refuse to answer the call, 
and do not play the game now, will go down to 
posterity as shirkers and as cowards.’ 
KK, °
-P-A-G-E-238
  226 A GLIMPSE OF HEAVEN. 
Colonel Hastings had a tour of inspection to 
make that day, and, of course, Oliver went with 
him, as father and son had much to talk about. 
Oliver’s sister Marjory, some two years older than 
himself, was also of the party. Everywhere they 
went they saw young Britain springing to arms, 
nobly answering the call. The cry for help had 
not yet been wafted from the trenches across thé 
Channel, but the call to arms had sounded, and on 
all hands men, young and middle-aged, married and 
single, were hastening to their country’s aid. 
As the car sped down the North Road they 
passed a yeomanry regiment on the march; later 
on they saw a battery. In Regent’s Park were 
thousands—clean-limbed, eager-eyed lads—drilling 
in shirt-sleeves, having discarded coats and waistcoats 
on account of the heat. Few, very few, had uni- 
forms; none had weapons; but they were beginning 
to move like soldiers. 
In the Temple Gardens the same sight was seen. 
Keen, eager men, barristers, solicitors, clerks, drill- 
ing, marching, and perspiring! In Hyde Park, on 
Blackheath or Hampstead, north, south, east, and 
west, it was always the same. Young Britain was 
preparing ! 
And the Lion’s cubs were rallying round too; 
from Canada, from Australia, from India, from New 
Zealand, the best manhood of the Colonies was 
rushing. It was their reply to the Kaiser’s plans. 
He had counted on treason at home and in India, 
disaffection in the Colonies; his answer was offers 
of men, of money, of all they possessed from almost 
every British colony. 
‘It’s wonderful to see the drill of those chaps
-P-A-G-E-239
A GLIMPSE OF HEAVEN. 227 
after the short time they ’ve been at it,’ said Oliver 
to his father as they watched a squad at work at 
the back of Whitehall. ‘In six months they ’ll be 
ready to meet the Germans, who are no foe to 
be sneezed at.’ 
‘Let us hope that six months may not be too 
late, Oliver,’ replied his father. 
They went to Limmer’s to lunch, whence Colonel 
Hastings rang up his home to ask if there were 
any urgent letters for him. There were not; but 
he was told that a Mr Drummond had telephoned 
for Oliver, saying he wanted to speak to him on 
important business. He had left his telephone 
number, and Oliver at once rang him up. He 
learnt that he must be ready to start back that 
very night, and that his friend was quite close 
by, in St James’s Street. As he hadn’t lunched, 
Oliver asked him to come round to Limmer’s. 
Vivian at first demurred, saying he could not afford 
the time, as he wanted to run down into Surrey 
and see his own people; but at last he consented 
to drop in for just half-an-hour, and in ten minutes’ 
time he appeared. 
He greeted Oliver most cordially, expressed him- 
self delighted to meet Colonel Hastings, and then 
devoted the whole of his attention to Marjory, to 
whom he apparently proved a very pleasant com- 
panion. The half-hour grew into an hour and a 
half, and then Vivian said that it wasn’t absolutely 
imperative they should start back that night; to- 
morrow would do. He at once accepted an invita- 
tion to dine with the Hastingses, and then they all 
departed to a military tailor’s, with whom both 
Vivian and Oliver had business to transact. When
-P-A-G-E-240
    228 A GLIMPSE OF HEAVEN. 
they parted Vivian promised to be at The Hollies 
at seven sharp. He arrived quite punctually. 
Faultlessly groomed, and dressed in a new uni- 
form, he looked every inch a soldier, and a very 
handsome one, too. After dinner they had some 
music, and Oliver found that Vivian possessed a 
very musical baritone voice, and a pleasant evening 
was spent. Vivian stayed the night; and when 
they arrived down to breakfast next morning, the 
colonel met them with a beaming face. 
‘Glorious news, boys,’ he said as he waved his 
Times ; ‘our sailor-lads have made a raid on Heli- 
goland and played Old Harry with the Germans.’ 
‘Hurrah!’ cried Oliver. ‘I knew the navy 
would give the Deutschers beans when they found 
them.’ 
‘Yes,’ said the colonel, reading from his paper. 
«“A force of cruisers and submarines attacked the 
German boats guarding the approach to the coast. 
They sank the Kéln, the Mainz, another cruiser, 
and two destroyers; our loss in ships is nil, with 
only sixty-nine men killed and wounded against the 
Germans’ 1200 killed.”’ 
‘A very good bag,’ said Vivian. 
‘«Further, the Russian victory is confirmed. 
They have completely routed four Austrian army 
corps near Lemberg, and claim to have killed and 
wounded 25,000, and to have captured 100,000 
men, with 400 guns.”’ 
This news naturally cheered up the listeners, and 
they were in a very good humour. 
They all went to an afternoon performance at a 
theatre, followed by tea at Stewart’s, during which 
Marjory and Vivian had a great deal to say to each
-P-A-G-E-241
A GLIMPSE OF HEAVEN. 229 
other that apparently it was not necessary for the 
others to hear. 
But, like everything else, the tea came to an 
end; and then there was a hurried drive to The 
Hollies, a rather sad leave-taking, and Oliver and 
Vivian found themselves together on their way to 
Hendon. 
For a little while neither spoke; then Oliver 
said, ‘Being at home in the midst of all this peace 
again is almost like a glimpse of heaven.’ 
“Yes, it’s been like heaven,’ said Vivian absently. 
‘But I couldn’t stay while this war’s on,’ con- 
tinued Oliver. ‘I feel as if I should go mad if I 
were forced to stop at home, playing tennis, and 
going to dinners, theatres, and so on, while our 
gallant fellows are giving their lives for their 
country.’ 
‘Many thousands of young fellows apparently 
find no such difficulty,’ said Vivian dryly. 
‘They are not worthy the name of men,’ said 
Oliver hotly. 
‘No. Every consideration should give way to 
the requirements of one’s country ; even love.’ 
Oliver looked at his companion quizzingly, so 
different did this new Vivian seem from the cool 
campaigner. 
‘Love! What on earth are you vapouring 
about ?’ he asked. 
‘I did not mention her name, did I?’ said Vivian 
hastily; and then he actually flushed, and both 
he and Oliver burst out laughing. 
‘My word! old Marjory has bewitched you, 
apparently,’ laughed Oliver. ‘I must tell her this , 
joke when I write.’

“If you do, you young traitor, the next time you

‘Break your neck in trying to rescue me, for the

has bright brown hair and—vwell, I'll leave the rest 
of the description to you.’ 
They reached the aerodrome, for they were going 
to return by aeroplane, and the commandant received 
them warmly. ‘Their machine was ready, and both 
were provided with life-belts in accordance with the 
new regulations, 
Oliver and Vivian took their places, the latter 
assured himself that everything was right, the 
engine was started, and with a cheery ‘Let go, 
boys,’ from Vivian to those holding, the machine 
bounded forward, rose in the air like a bird, and 
with a hearty cheer from the lads on the ground, 
away they started.  
-P-A-G-E-243
CHAPTER XXvV. 
OLIVER AND VIVIAN MEET A FORMIDABLE GERMAN 
WARRIOR. 
2 Y Jove, Noll! we’ve lost our bearings alto- 
gether ; we ’re too far to the north, I faney.’ 
Thus spoke Vivian some three hours after they 
had left Hendon. When they arrived at the coast, 
they had run into a fog and had completely lost 
their way. When next they saw the land beneath 
them Vivian could not locate himself, and had 
circled about for some time, until, judging by the 
position of the sinking sun, he had concluded they 
were out of their course. After having picked it up, 
Vivian altered his direction and made towards Paris. 
He ascended to a great height, and Oliver, looking 
through his glasses, presently saw masses of troops 
moving. 
‘They ’ll be Germans,’ said Vivian. ‘Get the 
gun ready, for we might get a Taube up after us at 
any minute.’ 
Oliver busied himself for some time, and then 
again studied the moving troops behind him. Pre- 
sently he called out to Vivian, ‘I wouldn’t swear to 
it, but it seems to me as if those troops are moving 
due east. If we’re heading for Paris, these fellows 
beneath us certainly are not.’ 
‘We’re going right enough,’ said Vivian. ‘Are 
you sure about the men below ?’ 
‘At this height it’s impossible to be quite sure.’ 
Vivian thought for a moment. ‘Any information 
 
-P-A-G-E-244
232 A FORMIDABLE GERMAN WARRIOR. 
we can gather is important,’ he said presently, ‘and 
we ought to take any risk to verify our suspicions, 
I'll drop a bit.’ 
They came down another thousand feet, and then 
Oliver was certain about the direction in which the 
troops were marching. 
‘Our army might have altered its direction, too,’ 
said Vivian, ‘but I know the idea was to keep to 
the west of Paris.’ 
Some very tiny flashes from beneath them showed 
the aviators that they had been seen or heard, and 
that they were being fired at. 
‘We must climb a bit higher,’ said Vivian; and 
he proceeded to do so, just as the shades of evening 
were falling. 
Suddenly the engine began to make a funny, 
throbbing noise, and Vivian busied himself for a 
minute among the cranks and levers. 
‘Great Scott!’ he exclaimed excitedly ; ‘the petrol 
is almost exhausted ; it’s either been leaking, or 
they gave us only just enough to make a straight 
journey.’ 
Their position was one of extreme danger. If 
the engine came to a standstill, the only thing 
would be to plane down, and that would land them 
right in the midst of the enemy. Certain imprison- 
ment till the end of the war would be the most 
favourable fate that would await them; if they fell 
into the hands of one of the modern school, saturated 
with the teachings of Treitschke and Bernhardi, 
they would probably be shot, just as an example of 
‘ frightfulness.’ 
It was not certain how far they would have ‘to 
go to get beyond the German front, but a mile or
-P-A-G-E-245
A FORMIDABLE GERMAN WARRIOR. 233 
two would put them in the rear. Vivian at once 
made up his mind. 
‘We'll get behind the beggars and take our 
chance,’ he said, and he turned about and went at 
full speed for a mile or two. 
Then his engine gave out, and there was nothing 
for it but to come down. Fortunately it was then 
almost dark, and as they approached the earth they 
saw they were in a part of the country apparently 
deserted by troops. They made a noiseless descent, 
and safely landed in a meadow. It was quite dark 
by this time, and Oliver and Vivian remained by 
the machine till the moon rose, when, with a little 
difficulty, they moved the aeroplane under the 
shadow of some trees. 
‘If we could only bag some petrol, we could get 
away all right,’ said Vivian. ‘Take careful note of 
the position here, so that we can find it again.’ 
They both had their pistols and ten rounds of 
ammunition, and, thus armed, they started off to 
reconnoitre their position. 
For some considerable distance they saw no 
houses, but presently they came to some cottages, in 
which they found only a few terrified French people. 
From some of these, however, they learnt that at a 
big house half a mile farther to their front there 
were some German soldiers. The inmates of the 
house had fled, and the enemy had taken possession. 
‘Well just have a look to see who or what these 
Germans are,’ said Vivian to Oliver; and they went 
off, soon finding the house spoken of. 
Taking advantage of every bit of cover, the two 
English lads went round the place, noticing there 
were lights in the lower rooms, while the upper ones
-P-A-G-E-246
234 A FORMIDABLE GERMAN WARRIOR. 
were in darkness, The front-door was open, and 
standing in the light was a large motor-car. Oliver 
and Vivian, watching from their place of concealment 
opposite the house, saw every now and then German 
soldiers pass and repass in the beams of light: 
‘That car means petrol, Noll,’ said Vivian; ‘and 
petrol means the wherewithal to get to the British 
lines.’ 
‘Granted; but how are we going to get hold 
of the petrol ?’ 
‘That’s the question. At present I don’t see 
how it’s to be done. If we wait till there are 
fewer men about we might stand a better chance, 
but perhaps by then the good gentleman who owns 
the car may have taken his departure.’ 
‘Couldn’t. we waylay him and capture the car ?’ 
‘The car would be of no use to us, and before we 
could get the petrol the noise of the attack would 
probably bring down a host of enemies upon us, 
and our fate would be promptly sealed.’ 
For the moment there seemed to be no prospect of 
attaining their object. 
‘Let ’s go a bit farther and continue our search,’ 
said Oliver. ‘We may have better luck.’ 
‘True! And we may find out something definite 
about the enemy’s movements.’ 
They crept away from their hiding-place, and 
some five hundred yards farther on came to a small 
house standing in what had been a carefully culti- 
vated garden. There were lights in the lower 
rooms, and Oliver and Vivian crept close up to an 
open French window, through which they could see 
right into the room. 
Vivian squeezed Oliver’s arm as a sign for him to
-P-A-G-E-247
A FORMIDABLE GERMAN WARRIOR. 235 
make no noise. They crept behind some flowering 
shrubs which concealed them from the view of any 
one looking from the room, but enabled them both 
to see and hear all that went on inside. 
In the room sat two German soldiers. One had 
his tunic off, and was sitting in an arm-chair, with 
his feet on another chair. He had a bottle of wine 
on a small table beside him, and was smoking a 
china-bowled pipe. He was a big, fat, red-haired 
man, with sunburnt face, a very red nose, and a 
heavy, drooping moustache. His companion was 
younger and smaller, and sat with his back to the 
window. The fat man was talking. 
‘Bah, Franz!’ he was saying; ‘I tell you these 
English swine are no good at all at fighting. 
They ’ll never stand before us any more. They ’re 
utterly smashed. I lived amongst them for years, 
speak their language so that no Englishman could 
tell I wasn’t native born, and understand their ways 
a great deal better than they do themselves.’ 
‘They ’ve inflicted heavy losses upon us,’ said the 
man addressed as Franz. 
‘There are bound to be losses; but ours are 
nothing compared with theirs. Why, at Mons I 
slew fifty with my own hands. We charged right 
into a Scotch regiment; they ’re the picked men of 
the army, you know. They are dressed in petti- 
coats so that they can run quickly, and are fed on 
raw meat to make them savage. I was the first 
man to come up with them—that is, Seyler and I— 
and I bayoneted them right and left till I was 
smothered in blood and my arm regularly ached.’ 
‘How did you get the blood off your uniform ?’ 
asked Franz, 
 
-P-A-G-E-248
236 A FORMIDABLE GERMAN WARRIOR. 
‘I—er—oh, I changed clothes with another man 
who was going back sick and wanted to make-believe 
he ’d done great deeds. I’m to have the Iron Cross 
—that is, after Seyler.’ 
‘Are you so friendly with Seyler, then ?’ 
A look of almost demoniacal hatred showed for 
a moment on the fat man’s face. 
‘We’re like brothers,’ he said; ‘we came from 
the same town, and did our first service together. 
He stayed on and got promotion, and I went to 
England when my time was up.’ 
‘Do you think we shall soon take Paris ?’ 
‘I know it. I tell you what, Franz; I heard our 
captain talking with a staff officer, and, so that the 
men shouldn’t understand, they spoke in English. We 
are going east to meet the Crown Prince’s army ; 
he is going to lead our victorious troops into Paris, 
and in one month we shall be in London.’ 
‘Is that so?’ 
‘Certainly ; and when we get to London, if you 
behave yourself and keep in with me, Ill make your 
fortune. We’re going to have London to sack, and 
I know exactly where to find the Londoners’ secret 
hoards of gold. Every man has a bag of English 
sovereigns hidden away, for they’re awful misers ; 
we ll have a rich harvest. And I know where the 
museums are, with gold and silver things by the 
thousand. And the girls too, they ’re very pretty. 
Ah, Franz, my boy, if you do as I tell you, you'll 
have a grand time.’ 
‘But what about the British Navy they boast so 
much about ?’ 
‘Bah! it’s sunk by this time; or, if not, our 
Zeppelins and submarines will destroy it.’
-P-A-G-E-249
A FORMIDABLE GERMAN WARRIOR. 237 
Franz thought for some time, and then said, ‘I 
always thought the English were good fighters, but 
you’ve fought against them, and you ought to 
know. I’ve only just come up from Coblenz, and 
haven’t had a chance yet.’ 
“You keep in with me and I’ll show you. Why, 
the English have quite got to know me. When 
they see me in front of my company they simply 
throw down their arms and fly. I captured three 
officers and thirteen men yesterday, after killing 
about a score of others.’ 
‘But how came you to be in front of the company, 
Kurz ?’ 
“Oh, I’m always with Seyler ; we ’re such friends; ’ 
and again the fat soldier scowled hideously. ‘Here’s 
to our arrival in London, boy,’ he said, as he drained 
his glass. 
‘T shall have to be getting up to the captain’s,’ 
said Franz, rising. 
‘Look here, you might just oil those boots of 
Seyler’s, and take them with you,’ said Kurz, a little 
shamefacedly. 
‘Do you oil his boots?’ asked Franz, in surprise. 
‘I offered to; I’d do anything for him, we’re 
such friends,’ replied Kurz quickly. 
Franz took a pair of top-boots and proceeded to 
oil them with salad-oil from a bottle on the table. 
‘Remember, I expect you to look after me in 
my first engagement,’ he said. 
‘Oh, that’s all right,’ said Kurz airily, and he 
launched out into terrible accounts of the prodigies 
of valour he had performed against the ‘contemptible 
English.’ 
Franz, having finished, picked up the boots, and

Oliver and Vivian stole away under the shadow of 
a high wall. Presently the soldier, who, they 
could both see, was a mere boy, went out, and then 
Vivian said to Oliver, ‘Come with me; we shall 
have some fun, if I’m not mistaken.’
-P-A-G-E-251
CHAPTER: XX VI 
VIVIAN AS A TACTICIAN, 
HEY both made for the front-door of the house, 
and entered. 
‘Have your pistol ready,’ said Vivian, and then, 
preceding Oliver, he boldly entered the room where 
Kurz still sprawled on two chairs. 
‘Joseph, bring me the wine list,’ cried Vivian 
sharply in English. 
Kurz leapt to his feet and answered, ‘Yes, sir ; 
comin’, sir;’ then stood, round-eyed and open- 
mouthed, staring at Vivian. 
“Der captain !’ he muttered. 
‘Not yet, Joseph, but hope to be soon,’ said 
Vivian. 
Kurz looked towards the corner of the room in 
which stood his rifle, the bayonet and belts fixed 
on the end, and the spiked helmet on top of the 
bayonet. 
Oliver saw the look, and just brought forward 
his pistol; on which Kurz completely collapsed and 
fell back in his chair, the beads of : perspiration 
standing out on his forehead. 
“Yes, you’d better keep quiet, Joseph,’ said 
Vivian sweetly; ‘any untoward action on your 
part might bring down my platoon on the house, 
and then, as they know what a desperate character 
you are, you’d get short shrift.’ 
Kurz slid from his chair and flumped down on 
his knees with a bang that shook the room.
-P-A-G-E-252
240 VIVIAN AS A TACTICIAN. 
‘Mercy! mercy!’ he cried. ‘I did not vant to 
come; dey sent for me and made me. I haf no 
wish to fight der English.’ 
‘But you are a terrible fellow, Joseph. You 
bayonet Scotchmen by the dozen; the English run 
at the sight of you.’ 
‘Ach, captain, dat vas all lies. I only vanted 
to persuade dat donkey Franz to help me vait on 
dat brute Seyler. He is der Feldwebel—vat you 
say, sergeant-major;’ and Kurz’s face grew black 
with hatred. 
“And you don’t love Sergeant-Major Seyler ?’ 
‘Lofe him! Gott im Himmel, I hates him! 
Since I haf rejoined he has beaten and punched 
and kicked me—me, Josef Kurz, who has vaited 
on English shenerals and noblemans ; who had his 
own house in London, mit an English vife and 
children. He has taken my moneys, and—yes, he 
has spit in my face.’ . 
‘But you told Franz you were such good friends.’ 
‘Bah ! Franz is a spy of Seyler’s ; he has just come 
mit der reserves from Coblenz. I am afraid of him.’ 
‘Surely you are not afraid of anything, Kurz— 
aman who can capture a dozen or so Englishmen 
single-handed, you know.’ 
‘It vas all lies, captain,’ said Kurz half-apologeti- 
cally. ‘I haf only been under fire once, and den, 
ach, mein Gott! it vas terrible, fearful. If ve vent 
on ve vos blown to leetle bits by dose terrible 
guns, or shooted t’rough mit bullets; and if ve 
stopped or retired our officers shooted us from behind 
mit pistols. Mein Gott, mein Gott !’ and he covered 
his face with his great red hands as though to shut 
out some awful sight.
-P-A-G-E-253
VIVIAN AS A TACTICIAN. 241 
‘Well, Joseph, that’s war, you know. Your 
country made it, and you'll have to go through a 
lot of it yet, before we ve smashed you.’ 
‘I vill not! I cannot! I shall die!’ Then 
suddenly, ‘Der Kaiser is mad; all der officers vos 
devils. Ve Shermans did not vant var; vhy should 
ve fight?’ Then, as an idea seemed suddenly to 
seize him, he continued, ‘How is it you are here, 
sir, right at der rear of our army? Haf der 
English surrounded us? Am [I a prisoner of var ? 
If so, I surrenders. Here, take my rifle and make 
me prisoner; den I shall be sent to England, and 
for me it is all over.’ 
“Gently, Joseph; gently. You’ré a prisoner, 
right enough, but I don’t want every one to know 
it just yet.’ 
‘Hurray !’ cried Joseph in such loud tones that 
Vivian clapped one hand over his mouth. 
‘Look here, Joseph,’ he said; ‘if I take you away 
as a prisoner, so that you will see no more of this 
war, but be safely and comfortably lodged till peace 
is declared, what would you do for me in return ?’ 
‘I vould—I vould ’—and here Joseph lowered his 
voice—‘I yould give you fifty pound.’ 
Vivian drew himself up stiffly. ‘Do you forget 
that you are speaking to a British officer?’ he said 
haughtily. 
‘No, no, sir; no, captain. I remembers you at 
der club. You vos alvays, alvays a great shentle- 
man; you vos alvays a liberal shentleman.’ 
‘That will do. Now listen to me. I can take 
you right away in safety if you will answer my 
questions. Was what you told Franz about Von 
Kluck joining the Crown Prince’s army true ?’ 
KK, P 
 
-P-A-G-E-254
242 VIVIAN AS A TACTICIAN. 
‘True as der Gospel ; I heard der captain talking 
mit anoder officer.’ 
‘Where are we now ?’ 
‘Right at der back of our army. Our captain 
is at a house a little way back; Seyler and some 
more men are in der cottages round.’ 
‘Has your captain got a car ?’ 
‘Yes, sir.’ 
‘Is he staying at a house about four hundred 
yards behind ?’ 
‘Yes, sir.’ 
‘Ah! Now look here; on that car of your cap- 
tain’s is strapped a can of petrol. Get that for me 
and I will take you out of all this, and get you 
sent to England.’ 
Kurz’s eyes lit up. ‘How vill dis petrol help 
us ?’ he asked. 
‘That does not matter,’ said Vivian. ‘You do 
as I tell you.’ 
‘I vill! I vill! Anyding to get avay !’ 
‘Come, then; put on your tunic and helmet. 
You can leave your arms here.’ 
‘Poof! I never vants to see a rifle again.’ 
‘Now come ;’ and all three left the cottage and 
went out into the road. 
‘Keep an eye on him, and see that he doesn’t 
attempt any tricks,’ whispered Vivian to Oliver. 
‘I'll lead the way straight to our machine. If you 
think I’m missing the way, say so.’ 
Then to Kurz: ‘If we pass any of your fellows, 
speak up; and, if you value your life, don’t give 
vaway the fact that the place is surrounded by 
British troops.’ 
‘Right, sir;’ and away they went.

Without accident they reached the place where 
the aeroplane had been left, and Vivian, whispering 
to Oliver not to let Kurz know anything, went 
forward alone. In five minutes he returned with 
a large petrol-tin. 
‘Now for your captain’s billet,’ he said to Kurz, 
and away they went, Vivian staying behind a couple 
of minutes as they passed a broad ditch, <A 
hundred yards from the house they all halted under 
a clump of trees. 
‘Joseph,’ said Vivian solemnly, ‘take this can, 
go up to the car outside the house, unstrap the can 
from the car, and substitute this one for it. If any 
one questions you, say you have been ordered to 
do it. Come back to us here. If you do so, I 
promise you this war, so far as it concerns you, is 
over. If you fail’ 
«Yes, captain ?’ 
“You shall be hanged, and your wife and children 
in London will be imprisoned for life,’ said Vivian 
in awful tones. 
‘Mein Gott! I vill succeed,’ said Kurz, and away 
he went. 
‘Who on earth is this fellow?’ asked Oliver as 
soon as Kurz had departed. 
“He was a waiter at the Guards’ Club. I knew 
he was a reservist, and I suppose he was called 
back at the commencement of the war. He is 
evidently an arrant coward, but fear will make 
him bold, so long as he does not see actual danger 
in the shape of a rifle or bayonet. It was a bit of 
luck falling across him.’ 
‘But what is in the can you gave the fellow ? 
Not petrol, surely ?’   
 
-P-A-G-E-260
  
    244 VIVIAN AS A TACTICIAN, 
‘No, old chap; ditch-water !’ 
Oliver could not help laughing; and then they 
waited anxiously five, ten minutes, when, to their 
joy, they saw Kurz coming towards them with a 
big can in his hand. 
He almost shouted out in terror when Vivian 
sidled up alongside him. 
‘You made me jumps, captain,’ he gasped. 
‘Right-o; come along;’ and taking the can, 
Vivian led the way. 
In ten minutes they had reached the machine, 
and Vivian was busy pouring in the petrol. 
‘The job will be when we start,’ he said. ‘I 
question whether we ’ve got room enough,’ 
‘We’ll have to risk it,’ said Oliver. 
‘Keep Kurz quiet while I make all ready.’ 
In another ten minutes everything was ready, 
the machine being lightened in every possible way. 
‘Now,’ said Vivian, ‘in you get.’ 
Kurz, when he realised that he was to go in an 
aeroplane, uttered a sort of gasping cry, and said 
he dared not. 
‘You ’ll be shot for being a traitor if you don’t,’ 
said Vivian dryly. 
‘But I shall fall; I shall be smashed all to leetle 
bits,’ moaned the German. 
Vivian took a coil of rope from the machine. 
‘Tie his hands and feet and bundle him in,’ he 
said to Oliver; and the massive Kurz, helpless with 
fright, in two minutes was lying by the observer's 
seat. 
Vivian started his engine, and Oliver swung the 
propeller. 
‘Hang on till I shout, “Right!”’ said Vivian,
-P-A-G-E-261
VIVIAN AS A TACTICIAN, 245 
and the powerful engine began to thrum and buzz 
with a roar that could be heard half a mile away. 
They were anxious moments, for the noise must 
attract scores of soldiers to the spot. Vivian 
anxiously watched the revolution counter. ‘Right!’ 
he shouted to Oliver, who swung himself in on top 
of Kurz. Then Vivian opened the throttle of his 
engine; the machine bounded forward, nearer and 
nearer the trees; it rose; Vivian tilted his planes 
still more; higher, higher, but they were almost on 
the trees ; a little higher, the machine actually grazed 
the branches, then shot ahead. 
Two, four, six hundred feet up. A searchlight 
flashed out below them, and a crackle of musketry 
was heard. Eight hundred, a thousand feet, and 
then Vivian headed straight for Paris, and put his 
powerful engine at full speed. 
‘Hurrah! hurrah!’ shouted Oliver. ‘Now, old 
chap, let her rip!’  
-P-A-G-E-262
  Co AP VER Xow, IL 
THE TURN OF THE TIDE. 
‘CIR JOHN will see you in five minutes.’ 
Such was the message brought to Oliver and 
Vivian by one of Sir John French’s secretaries some 
two hours later. 
Their escape from the German lines had been a 
brilliant success. After half-an-hour’s flight the 
lights of Paris had guided them; and soon, on de- 
scending to about five hundred feet, searchlights from 
below were directed upon them, and a gun was fired. 
The private signal was flashed from the electric lamp, 
and then the aeroplane, guided by the searchlights, 
came to earth, 
As Oliver and Vivian stepped from the machine 
they were met by several officers and men, who pro- 
ceeded to satisfy themselves that the aviators were 
really what they professed to be. 
Kurz aroused some curiosity, and more amusement, 
when Oliver lugged him out, one Tommy remarking 
that he looked ‘like a barrel in uniform.’ 
Vivian quickly stated his business, and a motor- 
car was put at his disposal. While this was being 
got ready he handed Kurz over to the charge of a 
picket of the Coldstreams, after telling him that as 
soon as possible he would make it his business to 
see that he, Kurz, was put in a fair way of being 
sent to England. 
All being ready, Oliver and Vivian jumped in 
the car and were driven into Paris, where General

French then was, and, having given their names and 
stated their business, they were told, as was remarked 
at the head of the chapter, that Sir John would see 
them in five minutes. 
At the end of that time they were ushered into 
_a small room, the table of which was covered with 
papers, maps, and books. Sitting at one side was 
the British Commander-in-Chief, and opposite him 
a broad, stout officer in French uniform, wearing 
several ribbons of medals and orders on his breast. 
He had a white moustache and bushy white eye- 
brows, and, unlike the majority of his countrymen, a 
stolid, impassive look. 
The British Commander-in-Chief, perhaps out of 
compliment to his French visitor, spoke in French, 
and welcomed Vivian back again. 
‘You may speak freely before my distinguished 
colleague,’ he said; ‘I have no secrets from General 
Joffre.’ 
Vivian then delivered his despatch, which, after 
asking General Joffre’s permission, General French 
opened and read. He then asked a good many 
questions as to the state of feeling in England, what 
people were saying in London, and so on. 
Vivian then related his and Oliver’s experience in 
the German lines, and told what they had learnt. 
‘Ha! this is indeed important news,’ said General 
French ; ‘it confirms what our airmen have already 
reported. I think, General Joffre, that we need 
now have no further doubt, and that the time for 
the offensive has arrived.’ 
‘Paris is saved,’ said the Frenchman simply. 
‘William the Second has lost his chance for ever. 
Now let his Generals look to themselves.’ 
 
-P-A-G-E-264
248 THE TURN OF THE TIDE. 
Oliver and Vivian were quite half-an-hour with 
the two Commanders, and when they were. going 
General Joffre said, ‘I should like the names of these 
two officers. France is indebted to them.’ 
‘And Britain too,’ said General French.—‘ Gentle- 
men, I shall not forget your services. You had 
better remain here for the present; one of my 
aides will find you a place where you can get a 
sleep. In a few hours I may require your services 
again.’ 
Very early next morning both were awakened by 
a staff officer, who wore a very contented look. He 
held a type-written document in his hand. 
‘Read that, gentlemen,’ he said ; ‘it will be pub- 
lished as a special army order to the troops at once. 
In an hour’s time copies will be sent to all brigade 
commanders.’ 
Oliver read aloud: ‘“ After a most trying series 
of operations, mostly in retirement, which have been 
rendered necessary by the general strategic plan of 
the allied armies, the British forces stand to-day 
formed in line with their French comrades, ready 
to attack the enemy. Foiled in their attempt to 
invest Paris, the Germans have been driven to move 
in an easterly and south-easterly direction, with the 
apparent intention of falling in strength on the Fifth 
French Army. In this operation they are exposing 
their right flank and their line of communication to 
an attack from the combined Sixth French Army 
and the British forces. I call upon the British 
Army in France to now show the enemy its power, 
and to push on vigorously to the attack beside the 
Sixth French Army. I am sure I shall not call 
upon them in vain, but that, on the contrary, by 
 
-P-A-G-E-265

THE TURN OF THE TIDE. 249 
another manifestation of the magnificent spirit which 
they have shown in the past fortnight, they will fall 
on the enemy’s flank with all their strength, and, in 
unison with their Allies, drive them back.” ’ 
‘This is glorious news, Vivian,’ he said. ‘We got 
back just in time,’ 
‘We did indeed. I wouldn’t have missed this for 
something.’ 
In an hour they were ready. A car, driven by 
an R.E., was waiting. 
They had received their letters and instructions 
from General French, and both were to proceed to 
Jouy-le-Chatel, bearing despatches for the General 
in command, 
Both Vivian and Oliver had known Paris in 
peace-time, and as they drove through the city the 
terrible difference brought home to them the fact that, 
whereas in London life was going on in much the 
same way as in peace-time, and the civil population 
were going about their occupations and taking their 
pleasures as usual, leaving fighting and all such dis- 
agreeable matters to the soldiers, in Paris everything j 
was stagnated. It was not the French army only 
that was at war; it was the French nation. 
In the streets were to be seen only soldiers, very 
old men, young boys, or women. Many streets were 
quite deserted. In the once noisy, crowded boule- 
vards whole strings of shops were closed, often on 
the shutters being a notice which said that ‘The 
proprietor and his two sons are gone to the Front,’ 
or ‘All the staff serving with the army. Vive la 
République !’ 
There was an air of gravity and _ seriousness 
everywhere that seemed quite foreign to the city.  
-P-A-G-E-266
250 THE TURN OF THE TIDE. 
It was not panic; far from it. It was the quiet 
determination of a city which knows that a cruel, 
merciless, and unscrupulous enemy is at its gates, 
and has determined to oppose that enemy to the 
last gasp. 
Aeroplanes, armed with’ mitrailleuses, flew round 
overhead ; immense quantities of food and ammuni- 
tion were being concentrated ; cattle and sheep in 
tens of thousands were corralled on every open 
green space. The beautiful Bois de Boulogne was a 
stockyard. 
In the city thousands of men were busy piling 
earth round the walls of churches and other public 
buildings, and on all sides was seen a nation prepar- 
ing to make a desperate stand. 
On their reaching the outskirts of the city 
thousands upon thousands of soldiers were seen 
encamped, while refugees were pouring in from all 
the country round. 
But the news which Oliver and Vivian were bear- 
ing was to create a great alteration. When they 
arrived at Jouy-le-Chatel they found the British 
troops almost completely recovered from their long 
retreat, which had been the more galling to men 
who had always been used to go forward. 
The army order which Vivian and Oliver bore 
was distributed and posted up within an hour of its 
being received, and long faces broke into smiles, 
grumbles changed to song, and bad humour gave 
way to hilarious gaiety. 
Oliver’s regiment was at Jouy-le-Chatel, and 
" several of his fellow-officers came up to him as he 
and Vivian were walking through the market-place. 
All were eager for news from London, and in return

related that after Compiégne the army had still con- 
tinued to retreat, although the German pursuit had 
lost all sting. First across the Marne, destroying 
the bridges behind them, and then across the Seine, 
they had retired, until they reached their present 
position; and being thoroughly rested, many a 
Tommy told his nearest chum, in strict confidence, 
‘that he ’d see the jumpin’ Kaiser himself bally well 
blowed before he ’d retire another blinkin’ foot.’ 
And so the news that an advance was ordered 
created the wildest satisfaction, and men and officers 
made their preparations to go and fight against the 
perfectly trained soldiers of Germany with as much 
gaiety and light-heartedness as though, after a spell 
of hard work, they were starting on a well-earned 
holiday with everything free. 
At dawn on the following day—Sunday, 6th 
September—the British troops were roused from 
their slumbers by reveille. Hot coffee and biscuits 
were served round, and then the men fell in. 
Vivian had got a mount, and rode beside Oliver. 
It was a magnificent morning, and the smiling 
country was gay with cornfields, while the little 
farmhouses, with their bright gardens and heavily 
laden orchards, presented a scene of peace. The 
troopers sang joyfully as they rode, and ‘ Tipperary ’ 
was in full swing, varied with a whistling chorus of 
the ‘ Marseillaise.’ 
Old men and women, girls and children, gave the 
men flowers or fruit, and waved them farewell, as 
they passed by. By noon the heat was tremendous, 
and when the troops entered the green forest of 
Crécy a halt was called for rest and a meal. 
‘A bit different, this, from Mons, Noll,’ said 
 
-P-A-G-E-268
252 THE TURN OF THE TIDE. 
Vivian as he lit a cigarette, after having enjoyed an 
excellent lunch, washed down by some Burgundy of 
rare vintage. 
‘I should say so,’ replied Oliver; ‘if campaigning 
was all like this it would be the finest sport in the 
world.’ 
When they had passed through the picturesque 
forest, increasing signs of the enemy’s recent presence 
became visible. The corn-lands were mere stretches 
of ashes; the humble homes of the peasantry were 
wrecked and smashed. Chateaux had been pillaged 
and burnt, and here and there the blackened corpse 
of a murdered peasant was seen. 
The men left off singing, and set their jaws 
grimly. Evidence of still more senseless and savage 
brutality was soon forthcoming. Broken pictures 
and crockery, poor, valueless stuff belonging to the 
hard-working peasants, lay scattered about the road; 
little treasures, children’s toys, a tiny Sunday dress, 
musical instruments, had been savagely smashed and 
torn, and scattered broadcast on the road; a village 
ehurch had been burnt, the crucifix smashed, and the 
humble flowers and crosses on the graves trampled 
under foot, 
Cries of anger burst from the men, and Oliver’s 
colonel tugged angrily at his moustache. 
‘What an object-lesson to those people at home 
who prated of peace and said that war was done 
with!’ said Oliver to Vivian. ‘What a sight for 
those young men who still hold back when their 
country needs them! I wonder if they realise that 
this might easily have happened in Kent or Surrey, 
in Sussex or Lancashire.’ 
‘And who shall say it won’t happen yet?’ said
-P-A-G-E-269
THE TURN OF THE TIDE. 253 
Vivian. ‘The Prussian might is still unbroken, and 
their hatred against the French is as nothing com- 
pared with their hatred against us.’ 
‘It sha’n’t happen, sir, if anything we can do 
will stop it,’ said a grizzled sergeant riding beside 
Vivian, ‘Pardon me for intruding, sir, but it fair 
makes my blood boil.’ 
A little farther on a sight was met that steeled 
every man’s heart that saw it. A little cottage, 
smashed and wrecked in the usual way, was reached. 
Lying by the gate was a peasant, an iron bar in 
his hand, his head battered by rifle-butts. Behind 
him lay a little boy ruthlessly bayoneted to death. 
The picture told its own story—the father had 
defended his child, and both had been foully slain. 
Several men had dismounted, the old sergeant among 
them, and they reverently carried the dead to the 
garden. A man who had entered the cottage came 
out, a tear standing in his eye. 
‘The poor wo-woman’s in there, sir,’ he muttered 
to Oliver, striving hard to repress the sob in his 
voice. 
Two men carried out the murdered woman and 
placed her beside the husband and child. 
Permission was given for the men to bury the 
victims of Prussian barbarity ; and when the graves 
were dug and all three laid to rest the captain 
said a brief prayer, and the grave was closed in. 
Not an eye was dry among the circle of stalwart 
Lancers as they turned away. : 
‘Curse the brutes!’ muttered many a man; ‘they 
shall pay for this;’ and it boded ill for the Huns 
when the troopers of the Twelfth got among them.
-P-A-G-E-270
CHAPTER XXVIII 
ON THE RUN! 
S they continued their march through open 
country a dark line ahead showed a big belt 
of timber, and this evidently marked the enemy’s 
position. Suddenly the deep boom of a heavy gun 
broke the silence and a shell passed overhead, ex- 
ploding with a tremendous roar just behind. The 
sound seemed only to increase the eagerness of the 
British to get at the foe. 
Soon the shells began to drop frequently, and 
casualties occurred. The British artillery took up 
the challenge, and the roar of the guns, the scream- 
ing of shells, and crashing reports of the bursting 
charges were almost stunning. 
Oliver’s regiment moved out to cover the advance 
of an infantry column on their left, which was 
hurrying forward to the attack. Very soon the 
spits of flame and the thousands of little spurts of 
dust showed that they had come under rifle-fire 
from the woods, which were packed with German 
infantry. 
The British continued to advance, but took 
advantage of every particle of cover; on seeing 
which the Germans, in their usual bombastic 
fashion, concluded that they had overawed the 
contemptible enemy. In the old close formation, 
‘column of clumps,’ as a Tommy facetiously called 
it, they came stolidly forward. The British held 
their fire till the signal-whistle went; then, every 
\
-P-A-G-E-271
ON THE RUN! 255 
man taking careful aim, they opened a withering 
fire. 
It was the same old tale over again; the German 
lines wavered, crumpled up, and finally fled. Five 
minutes sufficed to drive them back to their cover, 
and then the British crept farther forward. 
Fierce joy was in their hearts. They were 
advancing; they were winning back ground that 
had been lost; they were avenging the senseless 
destruction of property and the brutal murder of 
women and children. 
Meanwhile the artillery maintained a furious duel, 
and though the Germans had a number of heavy 
guns interspersed among the lighter ones, the British 
artillery dominated and smashed them. 
The cavalry, dismounted, followed the infantry, 
and burned with impatience for the word to mount 
and dash at the foe; but for the present they had 
to be kept on the leash. 
For two hours the fight went on; then, above 
the rattle of the rifles, rang the order, ‘ Fix bayonets 
and charge !’ 
Oh, the ecstasy of that moment, the delight of 
at last being permitted to rise up and fly at the 
enemy, to meet him hand to hand, to cross steel 
with him after those weeks of retreat ! 
With the stern, appalling shout of the British 
soldier, which no foeman has ever heard unmoved, 
the infantry dashed forward, gained the woods, and 
in five minutes hurled the enemy headlong from his 
position. 
Line after line of trenches, full of dead and 
wounded Germans, was captured. The enemy ran 
for their lives, and the British followed. The cavalry 
 
-P-A-G-E-272
256 ON THE RUN! 
could hardly be kept from dashing at the foe, but 
they were restrained, and had to proceed, dismounted, 
over the trenches and ground pitted with great holes 
made by the high-explosive shells, 
The Germans were in full retreat, and the British 
pursued till it was dark, capturing a large number 
of prisoners. 
A lot of these were later on marched past the 
spot where Oliver and Vivian were standing, and 
the British soldiers, exasperated by the fearful sights 
they had seen during their advance, looked con- 
temptuously upon their sullen-faced captives. 
One high-collared, supercilious-looking lieutenant, 
seeing the British officers, complained in indignant 
tones about being ‘herdéd with common soldiers 
like a private.’ 
Oliver and Vivian were the only two who under- 
stood German, and Vivian replied, ‘Men belonging 
to an army that disgraces itself by acts such as 
those we have seen to-day do not deserve to be 
treated as prisoners of war at all. If you had 
your deserts, all the officers should be handed over 
to the peasantry to be dealt with as you richly 
deserve. Go, sir, with your fit companions, and do 
not presume to address your conversation to British 
officers and gentlemen.’ 
Thoroughly abashed, the man slunk along, and 
many of the rank and file stared with open-mouthed 
Teuton rudeness at the ‘Engliinder’ who spoke such 
fluent German, and who dared so to censure a 
Prussian officer. 
The troops bivouacked wills they had fought, 
and before dawn were on the move after aie 
Germans. The British were then in touch with 
 
-P-A-G-E-273
  ON THE RUN! 257 
the French on both flanks, and their advance was 
irresistible. 
Oliver and Vivian were in front with the cavalry, 
which, assisted by the aeroplanes, was successful 
in locating the enemy. Then the artillery opened 
fire and pounded the foe till it was time for the 
infantry to attack, and hour after hour the Germans 
were hurled back with great loss. 
The British were in their element, and in spite 
of the terrific heat and constant fighting, no one 
spoke of fatigue. The advance was through a 
fertile country, much of the fighting taking place 
in orchards loaded with plums, apples, and pears. 
The Germans had prepared many places with 
trenches and machine-guns, and confidently ex- 
pected to treat’ the British as the British had 
treated them on the retreat from Mons. But again 
they were at fault. They held their trenches, 
expecting the enemy to march up to them in dense, 
solid formation, and be mown down as they them- 
selves had been; but they soon found their defensive 
tactics were as faulty as their offensive ones had 
been. The British artillery, with concentrated fire, 
covered the advance of the infantry, who fought 
their way steadily forward, taking advantage of 
every scrap of cover. Hayricks, undulations, trees, 
hedges, ditches, all served their purpose, and, in 
widely extended order, they moved across ground 
under a fire from machine-guns and rifles that 
would have made a holocaust of troops in close 
formation. The lessons of the Boer war had not 
been in vain ! 
Then, after they had got close to the trenches, 
the word was given, bayonets were fixed, and with 
> KK Q
-P-A-G-E-274
a 
  258 ON THE RUN! 
a roar the lads swept down on the Germans, driving 
the foe headlong before them. 
It was a glorious day for the Allies, and that 
night Oliver and Vivian took up their quarters in 
an old chateau. 
German officers had evacuated it only that 
morning, and it had been senselessly smashed and 
mercilessly pillaged. The dining-room was heaped 
with the wreckage of a drunken meal; broken 
bottles were everywhere ; drawers, cupboards, ward- 
robes had been broken open and their contents 
thrown about the rooms. Beds had been ripped 
up, mirrors and pianos smashed, pictures slashed 
across, and statuary broken. All small articles of 
value had been carried off. The officers had followed 
faithfully the example of their Imperial master, the 
Crown Prince ! 
‘Crown thief, I should call him,’ said Oliver as 
he sadly surveyed the scene, 
‘And to think that this might have been The 
Hollies,’ said Vivian gravely. ‘Truly it is time 
Prussian militarism was smashed for ever.’ 
Supper was eaten and cigars were produced, but 
ere they were finished trumpets were heard sounding 
‘Boot and Saddle,’ and the cavalry had to turn out. 
‘What’s the matter now, I wonder?’ asked 
Oliver. 
‘We shall soon know,’ replied his friend as they 
fell in with Oliver’s squadron. 
‘The Germans are to be pursued vigorously,’ were 
their orders; and as the troopers went off at a trot 
vows were made that there should be no slackness 
on their part. 
The night was stormy, but the moon shone out
-P-A-G-E-275
  ON THE RUN! 259 
fitfully, and there would be light enough for the 
work in hand. The rough weather was hindering 
the German retreat; it seemed as if the elements 
were angry at their savage behaviour, and _ the 
British were going to take full advantage of their 
opportunity. As they swung out upon the now 
muddy roads, evidences of the haste of the German 
retreat were everywhere visible. The way was 
littered with rifles, knapsacks, cartridge-belts, and 
helmets. Presently dead and wounded men were 
overtaken, then footsore stragglers, who, long before 
the cavalry reached them, frantically waved their 
hands above their heads, shouting, ‘Merey ! mercy !’ 
—they had soon picked up that English word—‘ wir 
ergeben wns.’ 
‘Bah!’ growled a trooper; ‘they are quick 
enough at surrendering directly they ‘re in a corner.’ 
Their surrender was received in silence, and they 
were passed to the rear in hundreds. 
Presently several squadrons of cavalry were seen 
ahead, and the ranks were closed. A sputtering 
fire was opened by the enemy, but the British did 
not trouble to reply. lLances came down to the 
‘engage,’ and with an avenging cry they dashed at 
the foe, a crack regiment of the First, Army. 
They went through them as though they had been 
made of pasteboard, and exacted a heavy toll. The 
Germans seemed terrified, and after the first shock 
turned to fly, but the road was choked, and Vivian, 
fighting with fury, cried out, ‘Remember Mons!’ The 
British troopers cut down or speared every man who 
resisted ; then on through and past them. Dead 
horses and men littered the way; a battery of guns 
was in front, the men lashing the poor exhausted 
 
-P-A-G-E-276
pe ES 
260 ON THE RUN! 
horses, cursing and shouting, and straining every 
nerve to fly from their pursuers. All was of no 
avail, The cavalry came up to them, rode by on 
each flank, smote and spared not, and the battery 
was taken. 
Then on again to where yet another battery was 
vainly endeavouring to fly. Hearing the shouts of 
the British, the drivers frantically cut the traces 
of the guns, which, in the now sodden road, they 
could not move, and endeavoured on the gun teams 
to save their own lives. In vain—those pursuing 
horsemen caught them, slew or captured them, 
and then on, mile after mile, exacting a terrible 
vengeance for what they themselves had had to 
endure. 
At last the exhausted horses could do no more, 
and the pursuit had to be abandoned, It had cost 
the enemy dear in dead and wounded, besides a 
good thousand prisoners and twelve guns. 
‘The German Mons,’ said Vivian as he dis- 
mounted, ‘only with a slight difference. The “con- 
temptible” worm has turned, and, lo! it turns out 
to be a dragon.’ 
Drenched as they were, they bivouacked in a 
little village, and waited for morning. With day- 
light came the never weary Army Service Corps, 
and food, forage, and ammunition were served out. 
‘If we get a medal for this campaign, you chaps 
ought to get two,’ said a man close to Oliver, as he 
devoured a great slice of bread and jam. 
‘I reckon a pension’ll do as well, chummy,’ 
replied the cheery lorry-driver, as he turned his 
empty car to return, 
That day the enemy made a great effort to check
-P-A-G-E-277
    
          ON THE RUN! 261 
the British pursuit. Whatever else was wrong with 
the Germans, Von Kluck’s generalship was at times 
brilliant, and, to hold the Marne, he threw to the 
rear all his cavalry, well supported by guns. 
The day was bright, and soon after the march 
was resumed signs that the enemy was determined 
to dispute every foot of the way were evident. It 
was reported that Maubeuge had fallen, and the 
men and heavy guns released from before that 
fortress had been hurried up to hold the French 
and the British in check. 
Three cavalry divisions, amongst them the famous 
Guard Division, were set the task of opposing the 
British, while the infantry entrenched. 
At daybreak the German artillery opened a 
terrific fire, but the British guns soon asserted their 
superiority, and the relentless advance went on. 
‘It will be a cavalry day, I think, Noll,’ said 
Vivian, as they surveyed dense masses of German 
horse before them. ‘Our information is that there 
are seventy-two squadrons opposed to our forty-five.’ 
‘Less than two to one! That’s nothing!’ replied 
Oliver lightly. ‘At Compitgne they were four to 
one, and they were in pursuit, too.’ 
‘Yes; I’m not inclined to bet on their holding 
us, Ill admit,’ agreed Vivian. 
For two hours fierce fighting took place, but the 
British got’ nearer and nearer the Petit Morin, 
which the Germans were making desperate efforts to 
prevent them from crossing. They massed their 
cavalry in brigades, and these they used dismounted, 
trying to hold the British cavalry back with rifle- 
fire. But the British horse were as much at home 
with the rifle as with lance or sword, and they
-P-A-G-E-278
  262 ON THE RUN! 
treated the enemy to such a hurricane of lead that 
he remounted and retired. 
Then the British judged that the moment had 
come. The men were mounted, ranks closed, and 
the word to charge was given, In the good old- 
fashioned way, knee to knee, the troopers rode home. 
Oliver's regiment cut into a Guard Cuirassier 
regiment, and inflicted severe loss on them. It was 
clear that the Germans no longer relished meeting 
the British steel, and after the first shock they gave 
way, riding off or surrendering. The pride of the 
German cavalry that day received a bitter fall. 
Dashing on in pursuit of the horsemen, the 
British chased them over the Petit Morin, and cross- 
ing after them, greatly assisted the passage of the 
infantry. And from then, although the fighting 
was of a most desperate character, the Germans 
were allowed no respite. Although the battle 
swayed backwards and forwards with tremendous 
violence, both the French and the British hurled the 
enemy back all along the line. From the Petit 
Morin, the British drove the Germans to the Marne. 
On account of the bridges having been broken down 
by the British in their retreat, the Germans could 
not get over quick enough, and thousands were cut 
off before they could get across. 
The German guns thundered from the opposite 
heights, so as to cover the retreat of their infantry, 
but the British pushed on and on, always plying the 
enemy with rifle-fire, until the cavalry were loosed, 
charged in, and, as night fell, cut the enemy down 
by scores, and drove the remainder by hundreds into 
the river. It was a fearful scene, the banks lit 
up with the light of cottages, fired by the Germans
-P-A-G-E-279
  ON THE RUN! 263 
in their retreat, the white scared faces of the 
Germans as they fled wildly, the grim figures of the 
British, cavalry and infantry, the final struggle on 
the water’s edge, and then the mad dash into the 
waters, swollen by the recent rains, of the harried 
soldiers as théy endeavoured to swim across. 
Weighed down by their equipment, they were 
swept away in hundreds; nor did the slaughter 
cease until not a German, except those who had 
surrendered, was left on the south bank of the 
river. 
Not yet were the labours of the day over. The 
Engineers got to work, pontoons were built, and the 
British began to cross. 
‘There must be no slackening, Noll, that’s certain,’ 
said Vivian; ‘having got these Hun gentlemen on 
the run, by all means let us keep them so,’
-P-A-G-E-280
CHAPTER XXIX. 
KURZ WAXES VALIANT. 
a desperate fighting, the end of the next 
day saw the Germans swept back to the 
river Ourcq, with a loss, besides their killed and 
wounded, of thirteen cannon, nine machine-guns, 
and 2000 prisoners. 
The following morning the river was crossed by 
the British, quite unopposed, and the cavalry pushed 
on, to find that the Germans held the heights south 
of the Aisne. Next day the main body came up as 
the last of the Germans were crossing, which they 
did successfully, blowing up the bridge behind them. 
The British field guns, taking up a position on the 
southern heights, were able to shell the enemy 
successfully and harry his retreat. 
The night was a wild one, with a high wind and 
torrents of rain, and fortunate indeed were Oliver 
and Vivian to get a comfortable billet. 
Dawn on the following day was ushered in by 
a terrific fire from the Germans. They had brought 
up heavy guns from Maubeuge, and seemed deter- 
mined to drive the British from the Aisne plateau. 
The British, however, had received a reinforcement 
of heavy artillery from England, and between them 
a hot duel waged all day. Meantime the rest of 
Sir John French’s army was hourly coming up, and 
those who had arrived had a few hours’ breathing- 
space. 
The Guards Division being only at Brenelle,
-P-A-G-E-281
KURZ WAXES VALIANT. 265 
Vivian and Oliver rode over to inquire after many 
mutual friends. They were exchanging greetings, 
and lamenting those who had met a soldier’s death, 
as a number of German prisoners were marching 
by on their way to be despatched to the British 
base. In front strode a beetle-browed, swarthy, 
non-commissioned officer. The squad had got just 
opposite Oliver, when suddenly Josef Kurz, clad in a 
nondescript costume of French red trousers, a British 
khaki tunic, and a cook’s cap, came rushing from 
the house in which the Coldstream officers were 
billeted, and, with a bull-like roar, threw himself 
upon the swarthy sergeant-major. Seizing one of 
his ears in each hand, he fairly lifted him from the 
ground, all the while shouting in German, ‘You, 
Seyler! You pig! you dog! I’ll show you! You 
kicked me, did you? Take that! You spat on 
me,eh? ‘Take that, you cursed hound! Ah! toad, 
beast, swine, take that—eh !—and that!’ and with 
all his might he slapped the prisoner on each cheek, 
as though he would knock off his head. 
Seyler, taken by surprise, had received a good 
deal of punishment before he recovered himself; 
then, flinging himself on Kurz’s chest, he apparently 
tried to bite him. But Kurz waxed valiant, tore 
him off, and then the two stumbled and rolled over 
one another on the ground. The other German 
prisoners began shouting, some that Kurz should 
be left alone, others that Seyler should be saved 
from further injury; while the British escort, not 
understanding a word of German, wondered what on 
earth was the meaning of it all, and shouted to the 
two to ‘drop scrappin’ and get on.’ 
Meanwhile the two Germans were tearing and \
-P-A-G-E-282
  266 KURZ WAXES VALIANT. 
kicking and scratching at one another like a couple 
of cats, till a stalwart Tommy, waiting his oppor- 
tunity, darted in, and catching Seyler by the scruff 
of his neck, hooked him up on to his feet. 
At this indignity the sergeant-major loudly com- 
plained, the while Kurz no less loudly demanded to 
be allowed to ‘tear Seyler to pieces.’ 
Neither Vivian nor Oliver could help laughing 
most heartily, and it was a minute or ‘so before they 
could explain what all the bobbery was about. 
‘I tell you what,’ laughed a young subaltern ; 
‘make a ring and let the beggars fight it out. 
Dashed if it isn’t the funniest thing I’ve ever seen !” 
‘No, no,’ cried several others; ‘there Il be a row 
about it;’ but the majority were in favour of the 
idea. A score or so soldiers gathered round, a 
ring was made, and Vivian told the disputants 
to set-to. 
‘Tell ’em I'll give the winner twenty francs,’ 
cried the sporting subaltern; and then, entering 
into the joke, the spectators took one side or the 
other, and the Tommies round, delighted with any- 
thing like sport, began to shout, ‘Go on, old Ikey 
Mo!’ referring to Seyler’s Jew-like appearance ; 
or, ‘Lamm into him, Carrots!’ alluding to Kurz’s 
red hair. 
The two combatants rushed at one another from 
different sides, both with arms outstretched, as 
though each was afraid the other would fly away. 
They fell into one another’s' arms, and each began 
violently punching the other’s back, all the while 
reviling loudly. 
‘ Accursed Prussian Jew,’ yelled Kurz, ‘now I will 
smash you!’
-P-A-G-E-283
KURZ WAXES VALIANT. 267 
‘Bavarian beer-barrel,’ hissed Seyler, ‘I will tear 
out your heart !’ 
Apparently he had an idea that Kurz’s. heart was 
in his back, for he thumped most vigorously ; but 
Kurz, having a longer reach, was able to administer 
greater punishment. 
‘Blow me if they ain’t like a couple o’ carpet- 
beaters !’ grinned a stalwart Guardsman. 
Tiring of back-punching, the Germans broke away, 
and commenced making hideous faces and abusing 
one another fluently. Then Kurz made a rush and 
aimed a sweeping blow at Seyler; but the latter 
stooped and butted in, while Kurz slipped and fell 
on his facer In an instant Seyler leapt on his back, 
and sitting astride him, with his open palms soundly 
spanked that part of Kurz on which he usually sat, 
the while that gentleman bawled lustily and made 
ineffectual efforts to rise. For fully five minutes 
this continued, till Kurz reached round his right 
hand, caught hold of Seyler’s leg, jerked it violently 
backward, and bit him in the calf. Seyler gave a 
tremendous yell and leapt up, when Kurz seized him 
by the hair, while Seyler returned the compliment, 
and they dragged one another about, making the 
most frantic noises. 
“Wool him!’ cried the Tommies. ‘Mind his 
scalp!’ ‘There’s hair!’ as a handful of black hair 
was torn out; and so on. 
After they had nearly tugged off one another’s 
heads and resorted to more face-slapping, Kurz got 
one arm hooked round Seyler’s neck, and pretty nearly 
throttled him, when Vivian declared Kurz the victor. 
Seyler was given a five-frane piece, and, amidst the 
laughter of his captors, and, it must be added, of 
\
-P-A-G-E-284
268 KURZ WAXES VALIANT. 
many of his fellow-prisoners, who all feared, and 
most disliked, him, he was marched off. 
‘How is it Kurz is here ?’ asked Vivian. 
‘He told us how he got away with you; and 
next morning, somehow, he managed to get hold of 
his present rig, and he got us ready the best break- 
fast we have had for many aday. Since then he has 
been so assiduous in his attentions, and has made 
our menu so much more attractive, that we haven’t 
had the heart to send him back to the base. We 
are never short of anything, though where he 
manages to raise the things is a conundrum. So 
the colonel has winked at his being with us, and no 
one else seems to care.’ 
The dinner that evening proved what had been 
said about Kurz, and he himself waited at table, 
telling, to those officers who had not seen the 
combat, the tale of how he had defeated ‘that dog 
Seyler.’ 
The event got noised about, however, and the 
sequel was that Kurz was sent to England with the 
next batch of prisoners, care being taken to keep 
him apart from his late sergeant-major.

OLIVER GIVES A LEAD. 
HAT night Sir John French issued his celebrated 
order, ‘The Aisne must be made good.’ Every 
one knew that more desperate fighting was before 
them, and long before dawn all the troops were 
under arms, 
Vivian had obtained permission to rejoin his own 
regiment, as it was clear the infantry would gather 
most of the glory that day. 
As soon as it was light, the great guns on either 
side, which had been firing intermittently all through 
the night, opened with an appalling crash, and from 
height to height belched forth, the huge shells shriek- 
ing across the river and meadow-lands which divided 
them, 
In the river-valley, which varies in width from a 
half-mile to two miles, the cavalry and infantry were 
waiting. For some hours the pontoon companies of 
the Royal Engineers had been working in the dark- 
ness. No sooner did the enemy see them than they 
opened a withering fire upon them from the northern 
slopes. The British infantry replied, and soon the 
valley became a very inferno of flame, smoke, and 
smashing, tearing metal. Above all circled aero- 
planes, British, French, and German, dropping bombs 
or signalling to their respective armies the positions 
of the enemy. 
Oliver's regiment was drawn up close to a pontoon 
company, who were working hard to finish their
-P-A-G-E-286
  270 OLIVER GIVES A LEAD. 
bridge. The Germans were shelling them furiously, 
and every now and then would shatter a piece of 
the work, or blow some of the heroic workers to 
pieces. The others worked on, apparently oblivious 
to the danger, unable to make any reply, just grand 
monuments of passive endurance. Their job was. to 
build a bridge for the troops to pass over. The 
other branches would do their best to protect them 
while they worked, or would avenge them if they 
fell. 
‘It makes my blood boil to have to sit here and 
watch those plucky chaps working like niggers under 
a fire they cannot return,’ said Oliver to his captain. 
‘If we could only get across,’ replied the captain, 
‘IT know exactly where the rifle-fire is coming from 
—that little wood away on our left.’ 
The infantry were sweeping the opposite slopes 
with fire, and presently an order came for the cavalry 
to dismount and open fire too. They advanced right 
down to the water’s edge, and shot so well and so 
, truly that they considerably reduced the volume of 
the German fire. 
At last the bridge was finished, and the cavalry 
were at once ordered to cross, They had to go in 
single file, for the bridge was a frail affair, and as 
each man passed, shrapnel-bullets hissed in the water 
on each side, or chipped off the wood in great 
splinters. No sooner had they crossed than they 
galloped to the wood, from which a hot fire was 
opened on them. Their blood was up, though ; they 
had seen the Engineers suffering in silence, and they 
were mad to avenge them. Straight to the wood 
they rode; then, dismounting, dashed in, and with 
their rifles drove the Germans out with heavy loss, 
 
-P-A-G-E-287
OLIVER GIVES A LEAD. 271 
The Germans made a rush for a small village ; 
but the cavalry, remounting, were after them, and 
not many reached the village, in which were more 
troops. 
The Twelfth passed on, and, in spite of heavy re- 
sistance, carried the village, intending to hold it until 
reinforcements came. 
But the German artillery got the range, and 
bombarded, the village with high-explosive shells. 
Houses collapsed as though made of cards, and part 
of the town took fire, A battalion of infantry 
crossed by the pontoon and pressed on up the slopes, 
reaching the wood, from which Oliver’s regiment had 
just driven the Germans. 
‘Gallop across to the officer in command, Hastings,’ 
said Oliver's colonel to him, ‘and ask him if he is in 
want of any assistance. If not, we must retire, or 
we shall be blown to pieces.’ 
Oliver saluted, mounted, and galloped towards the 
wood. As he went shrapnel burst over and before 
him, bullets whistled round him, and he expected 
every moment to feel the crash of bullet or shell- 
splinter. He got through, however, and was assured 
by the major of the Gloucesters that they were quite 
all right. Then followed another exciting ride, and 
Oliver breathed more freely when he dismounted 
from his panting horse, though shells were falling in 
all directions. 
‘We must get out of this,’ said the colonel. ‘We 
can do no good, and are only losing men;’ and s0, 
in single file, again under a terrific shell and rifle 
fire, the Twelfth recrossed the pontoon bridge. 
Almost miraculously, they succeeded in recrossing 
with a loss of only five wounded, and again got 
 
-P-A-G-E-288
  272 OLIVER GIVES A LEAD. 
under cover. Meanwhile the battle raged with in- 
creased fury, and from (Euilly to Soissons a terrific 
combat was waged. The Germans determined to 
hold the Aisne, the important reinforcements they 
had received enabling them to put new troops in the 
field. 
Oliver was fuming under inaction, but presently 
his chance came. A message had to be taken to the 
5th Brigade at Pont Arey, and Oliver, being well 
mounted, volunteered, 
He reached his destination and delivered his mes- 
sage; then, finding he was close to the Guards 
Division, paused to watch their attempt to effect a 
crossing. They were meeting with tremendous op- 
position, and, giving up the idea of throwing a 
bridge across, were preparing to ferry a battalion 
across on rafts. 
Oliver was on his way back, when, plump! an 
enormous high-explosive shell fell just in front of 
him, and exploded with a roar and a burst of black 
smoke. Oliver felt himself lifted from the saddle, 
and he fell with a crash on his back. 
For some minutes he lay, hardly realising what 
had happened; then he sat up and looked about 
him. A great hole, big enough to bury a motor-bus 
in, yawned in front of him; his horse, its head 
smashed by a shell-splinter, lay dead a yard away ; 
but he himself, wonderful to relate, was only 
shaken. 
Knowing it was useless to try to return to his 
own regiment, Oliver went off to the water's edge, 
where the Worcesters and Connaught Rangers were 
trying to build a pontoon beside the broken road 
bridge. But, under the galling fire of the Germans,
-P-A-G-E-289
OLIVER GIVES A LEAD. 273 
it was found impossible to succeed. Again and 
again the work was destroyed, and the loss of life 
was heavy. 
_ Oliver lay for some time watching the attempt; 
then, after a nip of brandy which an officer gave 
him, he walked down to the broken road bridge, the 
centre of which had been blown up. He went out 
towards the centre, and saw that one of the girders, 
a narrow iron span some twenty or thirty feet long, 
still connected the two broken halves of the bridge. 
An idea struck him: why not cross by the girder ? 
It was a risky business, as a false step would pre- 
cipitate him on to the masses of broken masonry 
below, and he would be smashed to pieces. But in 
war risks must be taken. He plucked up his cour- 
age, stepped on to the girder, and safely crossed ; 
then, delighted, recrossed and raced back to the 
Worcesters. In a few words he explained the posi- 
tion to the officer in command. 
‘By Jove, youngster! if that’s so, across we go,’ 
cried the major. 
‘It is so; I’ve just crossed and recrossed.’ 
The major explained the situation to his officers, 
and they clamoured to be allowed to cross. 
‘The boys will follow,’ they said; and the men 
being told a way was open across the broken bridge, 
off they went, Oliver and the major leading. 
Oliver felt much safer the second time, and got 
across all right, as did the major. Then the Ger- 
mans, seeing what was happening, opened a very 
tornado of shell-fire to finish smashing the bridge ; 
but one by one, balancing themselves upon the 
slender girder, a false step meaning certain death, 
the gallant soldiers crossed.

The Guards had also succeeded in crossing on 
rafts, and, forming on the northern bank, with grim 
determination they swept up the slopes, carrying all 
before them. 
Night fell, but it brought little rest ; searchlights 
swept the river, troops were moved with a view to 
the renewal of the strife on the following day, and 
desultory firing was kept up. 
For all that, there was satisfaction in the British 
lines. They had paid the price, but they had ‘made 
good the Aisne.’
-P-A-G-E-291
CHAPTER XXXxI 
A NIGHT IN THE TRENCHES. 
‘rPHIS has proved a tougher job than we antici- 
pated,’ said Oliver to Vivian one night, as 
they both crept into their dug-out in a trench, a 
fortnight after they had crossed the river. 
“Yes; the Germans are not to be frightened back 
across the Rhine by the springing of a rattle,’ replied 
Vivian. ‘They set out to lick everybody, and if 
they can’t do that, they ‘ll give everybody else as 
much trouble as they can before they own themselves 
licked.’ 
During the fortnight that had elapsed French, 
British, and Germans had fought desperately, and 
losses had been very heavy on all sides. A new 
division, twelve fine battalions and a brigade of 
artillery, had arrived from England. The northern 
slopes of the Aisne valley had been won, yard by 
yard; but by then both sides had thoroughly dug 
themselves in, and a sort of stalemate had arisen, the 
German position being considerably strengthened by 
their holding the celebrated ‘ Quarries.’ 
During the whole time the weather had been 
terrible, storms of wind and rain sweeping down 
through the forests of Compitgne, stripping the 
leaves from the trees, filling the trenches with icy 
water, and drenching the holders to the skin. 
The German artillery fire had been appalling ; 
Rheims, with its old cathedral, had been almost 
destroyed; and everything that stood in the 
 
-P-A-G-E-292
a ee ee ee ee rer 
276 A NIGHT IN THE TRENCHES. 
German line of fire had been ruthlessly swept 
away. 
Cavalry and infantry took their turn alike at 
treneh-work, and Oliver and Vivian sometimes man- 
aged to get their turn together, as on the present 
occasion. 
During the day, as usual, a number of violent 
attacks had been made by the enemy, but all had 
been beaten back. The rain was pouring down and 
a mist was rising, and Oliver and Vivian thought 
they might pass the night quietly. The shell-fire 
had died down, except for the occasional screeching, 
wailing sound of a ‘Black Maria.’ Then followed 
the tremendous ‘thud’ as it struck the ground with 
the concussion of an earthquake, and an appalling 
crash as it burst, tearing a hole big enough to bury 
a motor-car, and shooting up a fountain of mud and 
greasy black smoke into the air. 
Every now and then, too, the sharp crack of a 
sniper’s rifle added to the noise ; but rations having 
been brought up under cover of darkness, all were 
busy eating ; after which pipes were lit, and Oliver 
and Vivian crouched in their shelter over an old 
bully-beef tin filled with glowing charcoal, turned 
for the time being into an improvised stove. 
‘Progress is certainly slow,’ said Oliver. 
‘It’s also sure,’ replied Vivian, ‘No one who 
knew anything of the real state of affairs ever 
dreamt that it would be a short war.’ 
‘The Kaiser told his troops they would be back 
in the Fatherland, victorious, before the leaves fell.’ 
‘He might have said so, but I doubt whether he 
ever thought so.’ 
‘Perhaps not. One thing is very certain. He  
-P-A-G-E-293

never thought the Russians would mobilise so 
quickly, or that they ’d give the Austrians such a 
tying up.’ 
‘No; that must have been a great shock to 
Imperial William.’ 
Talking and chatting thus, they were both get- 
ting drowsy, when a slight noise was heard in the 
trench, 
‘Halt! Who goes there ?’ hissed a lookout man, 
and quickly came the response ‘Friend’ and the 
private signal. 
‘They are coming,’ cried a tense voice, as a sniper 
dropped back under cover, and in a moment Oliver 
and Vivian were out in the trench. 
Every one was on the alert, straining his eyes 
through the mist and darkness; while every now 
and then some one whispered excitedly, ‘Here they 
come !’ 
Presently the tramping of feet and the crackling 
of little branches and leaves as they were trodden 
on met the ear. 
‘Here they come!’ again ran in whispers down 
the waiting trench, as every man gripped his rifle 
firmly. 
‘They ain’t ’arf coming, I don’t think,’ cried a 
man near Vivian; and soon a dense mass loomed 
into view. 
Vivian sent a man back to warn the supports, 
then rapped out the order, ‘Rapid fire !’ 
A sheet of flame blazed along the trench, the 
black mass surged and swayed, shouts and groans 
of anguish rang out, as the British rifles dealt out 
wounds and death. 
The German officers were heard relentlessly and 
 
-P-A-G-E-294
  278 A NIGHT IN THE TRENCHES, 
insistently shouting, ‘ Vorwirts! vorwdrts!’ and a 
haystack close by was set on fire. The reserves 
dashed forward to fill up the German gaps, and 
were in turn mown down. 
They also hesitated. ‘Vorwdrts! vorwirts !’ cried 
the officers savagely, and strong bodies of reinforce- 
ments joined the reeling mass and swept it on. The 
men, trampling their hundreds of dead and dying 
under foot, shouting and yelling, got right up to 
the trench. 
‘Fix bayonets and charge!’ cried Vivian, and the 
' British scrambled out and dashed upon the mob. 
The Germans were in great force, however, and 
after a fierce struggle the British were pushed back 
into their trench, which the enemy occupied. 
Not for long, though, was their triumph. The 
British supports came dashing along the traverses, 
the Germans were driven back, and by the light of 
the still burning haystack were mown down by 
rapid fire. Another attack had failed. 
The British dead were laid at one end of the 
trench, and the wounded carefully tended, until the 
bearers stole up in the darkness for them, and in 
an hour, save for the moans of the wounded Germans 
in front of the trench, all was again silent. 
‘The same old thing over and over again,’ said 
Oliver sadly. ‘I wonder whether the fools will 
ever tire of throwing away their men’s lives so 
uselessly.’ 
As soon as it was daylight they were subjected 
to a particularly vicious shelling. ‘Black Marias,’ 
‘coal-boxes,’ and ‘ woollies’ fell all round, and part 
of the trench was blown in, burying three men, one 
of whom was killed.
-P-A-G-E-295
A NIGHT IN THE TRENCHES, 279 
The ground in front of the trench was covered 
with dead bodies in gray-green uniforms, and with 
many, alas! who were not dead. 
‘Poor wretches!’ said Oliver; ‘I should like to 
go out and see what could be done for them.’ 
‘And get shot down for your pains,’ said Vivian. 
‘No, thanks! The Germans have made the rules; 
they must abide by them;’ and so for hours the 
bombardment went on. 
Presently a very strong infantry attack was 
delivered, but it was directed more particularly 
against some trenches at right angles to those of 
the Coldstreams. Attack and defence were furiously 
maintained for some time, and after at least six in- 
effectual attempts to reach the trenches, the Germans 
held up their arms in token of surrender, 
Oliver had been watching through his glasses, 
though the Germans were not more than four 
hundred yards away. 
‘Look at that big officer on the flank,’ he said, 
handing the glasses to Vivian. ‘It’s Falkenberg ; 
I recognise him quite plainly.’ 
Vivian looked. ‘H’m!’ he said; ‘I wonder what 
his game is. He is not the sort of chap to surrender.’ 
The British signalled for the Germans to come 
to them, and they streamed across the intervening 
space. A British officer climbed out of his trench 
and shouted out for a German officer to advance. 
A private came on, but the British officer shouted, 
‘No; let your officer come.’ 
Falkenberg tied his handkerchief to his sword 
and came forward, the men following. ° 
‘Surrender; you are my prisoner,’ said the Eng- 
lishman.
-P-A-G-E-296
280 A NIGHT IN THE TRENCHES, 
The Germans, advancing all the while, had by 
this time reached the edge of the British trench, 
when Falkenberg cried out to the British officer, 
“Not so; you are my prisoner,’ and whipping out 
his revolver, fired at the subaltern. 
Immediately the Germans poured a volley at 
point-blank range into the British trench, killing 
a good many. 
‘The dogs!’ cried Vivian, and blew his whistle, 
when a machine-gun, which, in case of treachery, he 
had caused to be trained on the Germans, was turned 
on, and mowed the treacherous scoundrels down in 
heaps. Half their number fell, and the rest turned 
helter-skelter to fly, Falkenberg leading. 
‘Fix bayonets, my lads! They sha’n’t escape!’ 
cried Vivian ; and in half-a-minute fifty Coldstreams 
were dashing upon the foe. They came up with 
them, and not more than a score lived to reach their 
own trenches. 
A heavy fire from the British survivors of this 
dastardly trick pinned the Germans to their trench, 
while Vivian, Oliver, and their men, who had 
sustained no losses, regained their shelter. 
‘The cowardly brutes!’ said Vivian as they 
resumed their places ; ‘that will teach them manners. 
They paid pretty dearly for their trick, and the 
next time they attempt such a dodge I bet they'll 
make sure there are no trenches flanking them,’
-P-A-G-E-297
CHAPTER XXXII 
IN THE HANDS OF THE ENEMY. 
*¥ THINK it would be as well, sir, to throw for- 
ward an advance party through the village,’ 
said Vivian to his captain. ‘You can never be sure 
that the enemy is not up to some trick.’ 
‘Perhaps you’re right, Drummond. Take a score 
of men and go yourself,’ 
‘You come too, Oliver,’ said Vivian; and with 
his little party he doubled a hundred yards in 
advance, and entered a small village about a mile 
east of Chavonne. 
It was afternoon, That morning a wounded 
soldier had come into the trenches, bringing a letter 
from Major Robson of the Leicesters. They had 
been cut off just north of Chavonne, and were 
surrounded, the note said. They were holding out, 
but unless reinforcements were sent must be killed 
or captured. 
A scratch company, cavalry and infantry, the 
first troops that could be laid hands on, was got 
together and sent off. Oliver and Vivian were with 
them, and they were approaching the place where 
Major Robson was supposed to be holding out. 
There was one circumstance that seemed sus- 
picious to both Oliver and Vivian. The note was un- 
doubtedly genuine, and the man who brought it was 
a British soldier, wounded in the left arm. After 
reading the letter, the officer to whom he reported 
passed the wounded man to the rear for first-aid,
-P-A-G-E-298
282 IN THE HANDS OF THE ENEMY. 
but between the firing-line and the hospital the man 
had disappeared. This was not an isolated case by 
any means, for many men refused to have slight 
wounds dressed, preferring to get a chum to do it 
in an unprofessional way, Tommy having often a 
rooted repugnance to ‘doctoring.’ Still, the occur- 
rence, to one of Vivian’s experience, was suspicious, 
and he impressed this fact on the captain in charge 
of the party. 
The advanced party under Vivian had got half- 
way down the principal street of the village, when 
suddenly, from the other end, a man in khaki 
appeared, yelling out something and wildly waving 
his arms. Hardly was he seen than half-a-dozen 
shots rang out, and the man fell flat on his 
face. 
‘Halt!’ cried Vivian to his men, ‘Fill your 
magazines and fix bayonets; there’s something 
fishy here.’ 
No sooner had the men done as they were com- 
manded than a company of British infantry, with 
rifles at the slope, came swinging into the village 
street, marching towards them. 
‘Hurrah!’ shouted one or two of the men; 
‘they ’re our fellows. I guess they ’ve beaten off 
the German attack.’ 
‘Stand fast!’ cried Vivian, and the main body 
closed up. He and Oliver watched very closely 
those khaki-clad men approaching them, while the 
officer in front waved his sword and eried out, 
‘Hurrah !’ 
‘Beware of treachery!’ shouted Oliver. ‘ Those 
men do not march like Englishmen; that’s the 
German strut!’
-P-A-G-E-299
       ' 
IN THE HANDS OF THE ENEMY. 283 
‘You ’re right,’ cried Vivian.—‘ Captain, shall we 
fire a volley ?’ 
Before the captain could reply, the oncoming men, 
seeing their ruse was unsuccessful, opened ranks and 
doubled off to right and left, unmasking a machine- 
gun behind them. This instantly opened fire, and 
from the window of every house in the street, from 
front and from rear, a withering fire broke out. 
It was just another German trick; the British were 
ambushed. 
But they were not going to throw up their 
hands. Oh dear, no! Their rifles were at their 
shoulders in an instant, and a crashing volley rang 
out. In sections as they were, however, they had 
but little \chance, and though they inflicted some 
punishment on the Germans, they suffered more 
themselves. 
The British captain was killed with the first fire, 
and Vivian took command. The machine-gun con- 
tinued to vomit its murderous stream of lead down 
the street. 
‘Into the houses!’ cried Vivian. ‘Bayonet all 
you meet !’ 
Into the houses the men dashed, and _ fierce 
struggles took place. The Germans, when they saw 
the grim faces behind the bayonets, were stricken 
with fear, and many a score paid the penalty. 
Many of the British, passing through the houses, 
got away by the back, and made good their 
retreat. 
Oliver and Vivian led a dozen men to a large 
house about the centre of the street, and found it 
almost filled with Germans. They suffered some 
loss until they got inside, and then, with bayonet 
 
-P-A-G-E-300
a 
284 IN THE HANDS OF THE ENEMY. 
and sword, they drove the Germans from room to 
room, until not one remained alive. 
There were then seven of them, and Oliver, 
turning to Vivian, said, ‘ What next ?’ 
‘Throw every German body outside, collect all 
their rifles and ammunition, and bolt and bar the 
doors,’ ordered Vivian sternly; and this was done. 
‘Now to the windows, and shoot down every German 
who shows himself.’ 
For half-an-hour they did so, until the enemy, 
noticing the fearful punishment that was being 
meted out to them from that particular house, grew 
furious, and, headed by a big officer, made an 
attempt to carry it by assault. 
The big officer was Falkenberg, and the men 
apparently belonged to his regiment. The British 
had expended their own ammunition, and were 
using the German rifles; but they did good execu- 
tion with these, and drove off the attack with loss. 
‘Try again, Falkenberg, shouted Oliver, showing 
himself for a moment at the window; ‘you'll win 
in ‘the end. Bring in your men wnder a white 
flag !? 
, Falkenberg looked up and recognised Oliver. He 
scowled and cried, ‘I’ll have you yet.’ 
The Germans retreated, and for an hour not a 
soul was seen in the street but dead and wounded 
soldiers. There was food in the house, and all ate 
and drank. Oliver then examined the back of the 
house to see if any means of escape was open that 
way, but a couple of bullets whistling unpleasantly 
close to him showed him that the back was under 
watch. While he was talking over the situation 
with Vivian the vicious rap-rap-rap of a machine-  
-P-A-G-E-301
Re eT eR UT een em pre eeeT A! ener Oe ae re om 
IN THE HANDS OF THE ENEMY. 285 
gun rang out, and a stream of bullets crashed 
in the front window, killing a man and cutting 
through the inside lath-and-plaster wall as though 
it had been paper. 
Throwing himself flat on the floor, Oliver pre- 
sently peeped up just over the window-sill, and saw 
what had happened. The Germans had introduced 
a machine-gun through the back of a house across 
the street, and taking it up on to the first floor, had 
trained it on to the windows opposite. 
“We must get downstairs,’ said Oliver; ‘we shall 
be blown to pieces if we stop here.’ 
‘Right you are,’ agreed Vivian; and crawling 
across the floor, they reached the door and got to 
the lower room, just as a crowd of Germans, led by 
Falkenberg, crossing under cover of the machine- 
gun fire, dashed into the house. 
In an instant these threw themselves upon the 
British, and would have bayoneted the lot, had not 
Falkenberg cried out, ‘Do not kill the officers. 
Take them alive.’ 
But the British, though only four in number, 
were not yet taken. Oliver and Vivian had their 
swords and pistols, and the men their bayonets. 
They turned upon the Germans, and Oliver fired 
three times at Falkenberg. But that officer promptly 
shielded himself behind a private, and the next 
thing Oliver remembered was being knocked down 
by a rifle-butt, where he lay till the fight was 
finished. When he came to, his arms were being 
roughly tied behind his back, as were Vivian’s, 
whose face was bleeding from a sword-cut inflicted 
by Falkenberg. That officer was smoking a cigarette, 
looking calmly on while his men rifled the pockets 
 
-P-A-G-E-302
286 IN THE HANDS OF THE ENEMY. 
of the dead and wounded British soldiers. One of 
these, badly wounded, endeavoured to resist, when 
the German drove his bayonet through the poor 
fellow, pinning him to the ground. 
‘You scoundrel!’ cried Vivian in German. ‘I 
shall remember your face. If ever you fall into our 
hands, you shall pay for that.’ 
The German looked up, startled at hearing himself 
addressed in his own language. ‘Shall I shoot him, 
Herr Captain ?’ he asked of Falkenberg. 
‘Yes, tell him to do so, and then I dare say 
you'll get a bar to that badge of German infamy, 
the Iron Cross, which I see you wear.on your 
breast,’ said Vivian. ‘Did you get that for your 
white flag trick ?’ 
‘Silence!’ cried Falkenberg, flushing with rage 
and striking Vivian heavily on the mouth with the 
back of his hand.—‘Put these with the other 
English swine.’ 
‘A genuine German officer and—gentleman,’ said 
Oliver as Falkenberg strode from the room. 
Some soldiers then took hold of Oliver and 
Vivian, and roughly bundled them from the room 
and into the street, where they were insulted, 
reviled, and struck with musket-butts. 
‘Your manners are improving, my friends,’ said 
Vivian calmly. ‘Defeat apparently sweetens you.’ 
Again the men, hearing themselves addressed in 
German, looked nervously at their prisoners. Then 
one man said, ‘These fellows must be spies, else 
how do they speak German ?’ 
‘We learnt it so as to be able to get along 
nicely when we occupy Berlin,’ said Oliver, and 
the stupid-looking Germans seemed to ponder over
-P-A-G-E-303
     IN THE HANDS OF THE ENEMY. 287 
the remark, as though not quite sure what to make 
of it. 
As they were hustled through the street they 
both saw numbers of German soldiers wearing 
British uniforms. 
‘Take particular note of this, Oliver,’ said Vivian ; 
‘we may some day be able to bring this crime home 
to the Huns.’ 
They were taken to what had once been the 
schoolroom, and unceremoniously pitched in, Here 
they saw a sight that filled them with pity. Some 
thirty or forty British, nearly all wounded, sat or 
lay on the floor. In one corner was an officer, his 
face ashy-pale, and by him knelt a subaltern. 
Oliver and Vivian approached them. 
“It’s all over, I suppose,’ said the young subaltern 
eagerly, looking up. 
‘Yes; we were trapped.’ 
‘And so were we. When I heard the firing I 
was in hopes the village would be taken and that 
we should be rescued, though the Germans told us 
they would shoot us if you were successful.’ 
‘Pleasant people,’ said Vivian. 
‘Terrible, isn’t it? This is poor Major Robson. 
We were attacked yesterday, and he wrote asking 
for reinforcements. We never got a chance of 
sending the letter, for we were overwhelmed. Then 
the letter was found on the major, and the German 
officer in charge dressed one of his men, who had 
been a waiter in London, and was wounded, in the 
uniform of one of our men, and sent him to the 
British lines. They laid an ambush here.’ 
‘I thought the whole thing was a fraud. Never 
mind ; it’s one more crime they’ve got to account for.’   
-P-A-G-E-304
   
  288 IN THE HANDS OF THE ENEMY. 
‘The major is mortally wounded, but worse than 
the agony of his wound was the thought that he 
was responsible for the fate of so many of our 
countrymen.’ 
‘Poor fellow! he need not let that trouble him. 
No gentleman will ever understand the German 
character. And by the look of him, I don’t think 
anything will trouble him in this world much 
longer.’ 
Vivian’s words were too true. Major Robson 
died an hour later without regaining consciousness ; 
and soon after that, with much unnecessary violence, 
the whole of the prisoners were taken out, sur- 
rounded by a strong guard, and marched away to 
the German rear.       
-P-A-G-E-305
  CHAPTER XXXIIL 
CONDEMNED TO DIE. 
aoe any distinction, officers and men were 
marched off under guard. They were treated 
with studied brutality, being driven along with a 
bayonet-prod or a blow from a rifle-butt if they 
lagged. Insults, and sometimes missiles, were hurled 
at them on their march, Falkenberg, who was in 
command, taking no notice, nor even once making 
any effort to protect his prisoners. 
After a long and distressing march, during which 
not a solitary prisoner made any complaint of his 
brutal treatment, they were herded into an unutter- 
ably filthy prison, and there they remained all the 
following day, some black bread and a can of water 
being all the food and drink they received. 
‘And this, my young friend, is how most cultured 
Germany treats her prisoners of war,’ said Vivian, 
as they shared their hunk of stale bread between 
them. 
‘While we pamper our prisoners and treat them 
as honourable enemies,’ growled Oliver bitterly. 
‘We ought to give them some of their own sauce.’ 
‘Not so, young’ man. Two wrongs never did 
make a right, and to try to equal Teutonic barbarism 
would only lower us to their level. Besides, they 
would beat us every time,’ 
That night they were marched away to the 
railway station and crowded into horse-boxes, thirty 
to a truck, the condition of which defies description. 
KK. 8
-P-A-G-E-306
  290 CONDEMNED TO DIE. 
For twenty-four hours they travelled, during which 
time they were neither allowed to leave their trucks 
nor given anything to eat or drink. They reached 
their destination at night, and were handed over to 
a guard of Landsturm men, who, if possible, were 
more brutal than their previous guards. 
For several days after that Vivian and Oliver, 
with the other prisoners, were interned together in 
a camp of prisoners, suffering greatly from cold and 
exposure to the drenching rain and cutting wind. 
They were given just sufficient food to keep body 
and soul together. 
Every night the guards used to jeer at them, and 
tell them that next morning the whole lot would 
be shot. Tales of British defeats were constantly 
dinned into their ears, some of the wild tales being 
to the effect that the British Army had been sur- 
rounded, half of them killed, and the rest taken 
prisoners. London had been destroyed by Zeppelins, 
the British Navy had been sunk, while the Germans 
had captured Paris and had burnt Warsaw. 
At the end of four days Vivian and Oliver were 
separated from the other prisoners and taken before 
the General in command, a typical, Prussian. He 
questioned them closely about the strength of the 
British forces, said he knew they had both recently 
been in England, and demanded that they should 
state the truth about the so-called ‘ Kitchener Army,’ 
the feeling in London, and so on. 
Of course both Vivian and Oliver flatly refused 
to give any information whatever; on which the 
General denounced them as ‘ miserable English spies.’ 
They were then taken away and confined in separate 
cells. At the end of two days they were again
-P-A-G-E-307
     CONDEMNED TO DIE. 291 
dragged out, driven in a closed motor-car by night, 
confined for a day in another noxious prison, and 
then taken for trial before a board of German 
officers. 
As they were being marched in Oliver saw, 
amongst a number of officers lounging about, both 
Falkenberg and Dous, the latter, like most of those 
present, wearing the Iron Cross. 
The presiding officer, a gross-looking, beetle- 
browed fellow, with little, cunning, shifty eyes, 
said in German, ‘I understand you both speak 
German, so there is no need of an interpreter.’ 
‘Not the slightest,’ said Vivian. 
Their names, ages, regiments, &c. were taken 
down, and they were again asked a number of 
questions. ; 
‘I may as well give you at once all the informa- 
tion I, or my friend, Lieutenant Hastings, intends 
to give you,’ said Vivian. ‘The British force in 
France is. sufficient for its present task. Its losses 
will be made up from the finest army Great Britain 
has ever possessed. This army is animated with 
one idea, to smash for ever the curse of Europe— 
Prussian militarism.’ 
Angry murmurs arose from those listening, and 
the president said in sneering tones, ‘Like all your 
countrymen, you have a long tongue, and a lying 
one. Perhaps before you leave this room you will 
alter your tone——What has the other prisoner to 
say ?” 
‘Simply that your army is brutish; that your 
treatment of innocent non-combatants, let alone 
honourable prisoners of war, is sufficient to condemn 
you in the eyes of the whole world; that Germany, 
  
-P-A-G-E-308
  292 CONDEMNED TO DIE. 
loathed and detested, stands alone, without a solitary 
friend. The Allies will surely beat you to your 
knees, when, with your usual hypocrisy, you will 
hold up your hands and ery for mercy, saying you 
didn’t mean to do it.’ 
‘If either of the prisoners makes another remark, 
except in answer to a question,’ hissed the president, 
“bayonet him.’ 
They were then both formally accused of being 
spies; of having lived in Germany prior to the 
war; of having sent information to England, struck 
German officers, stolen military property, and foully 
murdered German soldiers. 
Captain Dous—as he then was—gave evidence of 
the brawl in Frankfort; of Oliver’s escape; of the 
stealing of a car in the Stadtwald; and of both 
Vivian and Oliver being the cause of having two 
squadrons of German cavalry foully murdered in 
Liége, and of a detachment of horse and foot, at 
a village called Maives, being massacred in cold 
blood. Falkenberg also gave evidence, and said he 
knew Oliver in Frankfort, and that, although so 
young, he was undoubtedly a spy, and that he 
had fired on German troops when under the white 
flag. 
Léffel then entered the room and gave damning 
evidence against Vivian, producing papers, all forged, 
to prove that he had been a dangerous spy for 
years. ‘ 
The prisoners, asked whether they had any answer 
to make, refused to speak, and the president was 
about to pass sentence, when there was some com- 
motion at the door, and Von Lenz pushed his 
way in.
-P-A-G-E-309
CONDEMNED TO DIE, 293 
‘General,’ he said, saluting, ‘I pray that you 
will hear me.’ 
‘This is out of order, Captain von Lenz,’ said the 
president sternly. ‘You were not bidden attend, 
and your interruption is a breach of military dis- 
cipline for which you will have to answer. Besides, 
you can know nothing whatever of this case.’ 
‘Pardon me, General, I know one of the prisoners 
intimately. I was at Heidelberg with him, and 
knew him well long before the war. I saw the 
brawl between him and Captain Dous, and, on my 
word. of honour as an officer, Captain Dous was 
to blame. Lieutenant Hastings is an honourable 
gentleman, and I believe Lieutenant Drummond is 
also. Near Maubeuge, when I was unhorsed and 
entirely at the mercy of the British soldiers, these 
two gentlemen refused to take me prisoner, and 
ordered their men not to fire at me. I owe them 
my life,’ : 
‘All purely personal matters and sentimental 
rubbish. Captain von Lenz, leave the court,’ said 
the president. 
Von Lenz again attempted to speak; whereupon 
he was literally thrust out by several officers. 
The president then asked those present, ‘Gentlemen, 
do you find the prisoners guilty or not guilty ?” 
‘Guilty,’ came an immediate answer. 
Then said the president, while his face was 
wreathed in an evil smile, ‘The sentence of the 
court is that to-morrow at dawn the few rags of 
uniform which you-wear shall be stripped from you, 
that you be hanged as despicable spies, and that 
your bodies be thrown out ‘into the fields.’ 
There was quite a look of satisfaction upon the Be
-P-A-G-E-310
294 CONDEMNED TO DIE. 
faces of the officers present as Oliver and Vivian 
were conducted from the room. 
‘Well, old chap, what do you think of German 
methods now ?’ asked Vivian of Oliver some half- 
hour later, as they both sat in the same cell, pre- 
paring to meet their barbarous fate like English 
gentlemen. ‘Do you remember I told you, as we 
dropped down the Rhine together from Mainz, that 
if Prussian militarism won, Europe would be under 
a tyranny as bad as that of the Middle Ages ?’ 
‘I remember it only too well; but I am not the 
less surprised at the fearful change in the German 
nation. At any rate all are not bad; Von Lenz 
behaved like a white man.’ 
‘He can’t be a pure German,’ said Vivian a little 
satirically ; ‘he hasn’t got the true German military 
spirit.’ 
‘I cannot understand it,’ said Oliver sadly; ‘it’s 
all too terrible. Anyhow, for us it is all over. Let 
us spend the few hours left to us in preparing for 
the future.’ 
‘Yes,’ said Vivian musingly, ‘we are up against 
it now with a vengeance. I could have met death 
on the battlefield easily enough, but to die like this ;’ 
and he walked angrily up and down his cell for a 
few minutes. ‘I should have liked to write a letter 
or two to my people, and to—to. But there, 
those brutes would only open and jeer at them. 
No, my boy; we’ve got to die, and we'll die like 
men. Oliver, I sometimes think it is my fault for 
dragging you into this.’ 
‘Rubbish, old man! I would not have been out 
of it for anything ;’ and they gripped one another's 
hands.

Night fell, and the two lads, having made their 
peace with God, lay on their miserable bed fast 
asleep. Their dreams were of home, and love, and 
happiness, and their boyish faces were wreathed in 
smiles when the door was softly opened, and an 
officer in helmet and greatcoat entered silently with 
a lamp in his hand, and gazed for a full minute 
upon the recumbent figures,
-P-A-G-E-312
CHAPTER XXXIV. 
THE KAISER SPEAKS. 
LIVER was awakened by Vivian moving about. 
Rousing himself, he discovered that Vivian, 
sitting on the edge of the bed, was speaking to a 
German officer. 
*Can’t we spend our last hour in peace?’ he 
muttered. ‘What does this fellow want ?’ 
‘I’ve just asked him,’ replied Vivian, ‘and if we 
wait, perhaps he will tell us.’ 
The officer had not yet spoken. He placed the 
lamp on the chimneypiece and remained in the 
shade. Oliver and Vivian had spoken in English, 
in which language their visitor then said, ‘You lie 
under sentence of death, I think.’ 
On hearing the voice Oliver felt Vivian give a 
slight start, but he answered simply, ‘ We do.’ 
‘Yet there is a way by which you might 
purchase your lives.’ 
‘Any way that is honourable we will thankfully 
accept. We do not wish to die.’ 
‘Why all this talk of “honourable”? You 
English are suspicious of everything. Occasions 
may arise which justify any means to an end;’ 
and the speaker, who had seemed to be attempting 
to disguise his voice, spoke out angrily. 
‘As, for instance, the violating of Belgium’s 
neutrality,’ said Vivian. 
‘Yes, before France had a chance to. But I 
waste time. Will you purchase your lives by giving
-P-A-G-E-313
  THE KAISER SPEAKS. 297 
me the information that has been asked of you 
about the British forces? I am told you possess it.’ 
“And if I do so, what guarantee have I that our 
lives will be spared ?’ 
‘The word of a German officer.’ 
‘After what we have seen of the way in which 
German officers keep their word, of treaties ignored, 
non-combatants murdered, the white flag abused, 
even the sorry trick by which we were captured, I 
am not inclined to trust the word of any German 
officer.’ . 
‘Tnsolent !’ rapped out the German. 
‘But nevertheless true.’ 
The officer was silent for a moment or two, and 
then asked, ‘To what trick do you allude? How 
came you to be captured ?’ 
Vivian told their visitor, appealing to Oliver for 
confirmation, and spoke also of the savage way in 
which they had been treated. 
“Yes, yes,’ said the German hastily ; ‘war cannot 
be made in kid gloves. Now, if I promise you your 
lives, will you tell me all you know of the condition 
and intentions of the British forces? I may as 
well tell you that I know you belong to the Secret 
Service, and are in a position to know a good deal.’ 
‘Your Majesty,’ said Vivian, rising, ‘we are 
officers and gentlemen. We are ready to die, but 
we do not betray our countrymen.’ 
“Your Majesty ?’ cried Oliver, also jumping up; 
and then, staring at their visitor, who for a moment 
stood in the lamp’s rays, he noticed the withered 
left arm and the fiercely upturned moustache. 
‘You know me?’ said the Kaiser, for he it 
was.
-P-A-G-E-314
  298 THE KAISER SPEAKS. 
‘I have twice had the distinction of being in 
your society and hearing you speak,’ said Vivian. 
‘When you were engaged as a spy,’ sneered the 
Emperor. 
‘Sire, I was no more a spy than the thousands of 
highly placed Germans in England, no more than 
the ordinary attaché. I left Germany immediately 
on the outbreak of war, and I always lived quite 
openly in Berlin.’ 
‘You have caused the murder of my soldiers; 
the officers who tried you were unanimous in finding 
you guilty.’ 
‘They were probably chosen for their task, your 
Majesty. _ There was one who risked something to 
speak out on our behalf, and I cannot believe that 
there would not have been others.’ 
‘Yes, yes, he petitioned me. It is through him I 
am here. Young Von Lenz is too tender-hearted. 
But I am in a hurry. Will you answer my 
questions ?’ 
‘Sire, do you imagine that British officers will 
turn traitor—you, who have English blood in your 
veins, who are a grandson of Queen Victoria ?’ 
‘Talk not to me of my English blood! TI hate it; 
I repudiate it. I am nothing but German; I am 
all for Germany, and Germany is all for me. IZ am 
Germany !’ and making this extraordinary state- 
ment, the Kaiser stamped impatiently up and down 
the room. Then he suddenly turned to the two 
youths. ‘Will you speak ?’ he asked. 
‘We will be true to King George,’ replied Vivian 
quietly. 
‘Bah! And who is this King George? You 
speak of my English blood. Yes, I am a grandson 
®
-P-A-G-E-315
  THE KAISER SPEAKS. 299 
of Queen Victoria. I am her eldest grandson; I am 
the eldest son of her eldest child. Why should I 
not sit on the throne of Great Britain ?’ 
‘Your Majesty knows that males take precedence 
over the females.’ 
‘Bah! Why did you not pass over Princess 
Victoria, then, and elect Prince George of Cam- 
bridge? Trickery! I have as good a claim to 
your throne as this King George, and, by heaven, I 
may yet reign in your British Isles—nay, I will! 
If I were King of England I would conquer the 
world ;’ and the extraordinary man again walked 
hastily up and down the room. Then he turned 
excitedly to the prisoners. ‘I do not know that I 
cannot claim your allegiance over your King George— 
your king, who is only fit to command a battle-ship.’ 
‘When you have conquered Great Britain, sire, will 
be time enough to speak of allegiance,’ said Vivian. 
‘And conquer you I will. My armies will march 
over you—-sweep you away. In a few days we 
shall be at Calais; from there we shall bombard 
Dover ; we shall blow your fleet out of the water ; 
our Zeppelins will carry death and destruction to 
London. Christmas will see me in Buckingham 
Palace—ay, perhaps crowned in Westminster! Who 
shall say ?’ 
This remarkable speech left both Oliver and 
Vivian thunder-struck. They could only gaze in 
astonishment at this man who controlled the 
destinies of the German Empire. For a full minute 
he strode up and down; then, without another word, 
he turned and left the room, the door of which was 
silently closed and locked behind him. 
‘Phew,’ said Oliver, ‘what an experience! No
-P-A-G-E-316
300 THE KAISER SPEAKS. 
wonder his officers are afraid of him; he’s a regular 
madman,’ . 
‘There is a very, very fine line between genius 
and madness,’ said Vivian thoughtfully. ‘At any 
rate we must give him credit for one thing.’ 
‘What’s that ?’ 
‘He does at least govern. He holds Germany in 
his hand. He inspires confidence and respect, if not 
love; his soldiers die cheerfully for him, and he has 
the country behind him.’ 
‘But he’ll never be a Napoleon,’ said Oliver. 
‘Pray God he never will, for he’d go farther 
than the Corsican if he were.’ 
‘And what will happen to us now ?’ 
‘A shorter rope than ever, Noll;’ and the two 
lapsed into silence again, and presently dozed off, 
to be aroused by two Dragoons with drawn swords, 
and an officer who curtly bade them ‘get up.’ . 
They obeyed. It was bitterly cold, and they 
shivered. 
‘Now, Noll, hearten up,’ said Vivian bravely. 
‘We can’t do as Charles I. did—put on an extra 
shirt to keep us from shivering, for fear people 
should say we were afraid.’ 
‘T am ready,’ said Oliver. 
Then to the officer Vivian said, ‘Herr Offizier, we are 
very cold, and shall soon be colder. We shiver a little, 
but it is the cold which causes it, not the fear of death.’ 
‘Come,’ said the officer, and they were marched 
to a fToom where hot coffee, rolls, and butter were 
given them. : 
‘Good heavens, said the irrepressible Vivian, 
‘what a waste of food! Quite against German 
ideas of frugality.’
-P-A-G-E-317
  Bn ee ee ee 
THE KAISER SPEAKS. 301 
The officer remained with them while they ate, 
speaking not a word. Then, wonder of wonders, 
two greatcoats, which had once belonged to British 
officers, were brought them, and cigarettes were 
offered them. Both Vivian and Oliver lighted 
cigarettes, and Vivian said to the officer, ‘We are 
obliged to you for this small attention. Now we 
are ready—for the rope.’ 
It was then only just light, drizzling with rain, and 
bitterly cold. They were marched out and put into a 
motor-car, the officer getting in with them. Wait- 
ing a little distance in front was another car, with 
several officers in it, one wearing a busby. 
‘Surely that is Von Lenz,’ said Oliver; ‘I just 
caught a glimpse of his face.’ 
“Come to see the last of his dear friends,’ 
suggested Vivian. ‘Well, off we go;’ and follow- 
ing the first motor, which had dashed off at great 
speed, away they went. Mile after mile they flew 
along, the soldiers they met, both men and officers, 
springing to attention and saluting the first car. 
‘This is passing strange, as they say in books,’ 
said Vivian to Oliver. ‘Where’ on earth are they 
taking us to settle our account ?’ 
On, on they sped for fully an hour; then the first 
car stopped, and the occupants getting down, one of 
the officers waved his arm to the second car. 
‘Absteigen,’ said the officer with Oliver and 
Vivian, and obediently they alighted. ‘Komm;’ 
and they followed him. At two paces from the ‘ 
officer who had waved his arm to them, he halted, 
clicked his heels, and came up to the salute. 
Oliver and Vivian, looking at those who had 
alighted from the first car, to their unutterable  
-P-A-G-E-318

surprise saw that the one standing in front was the 
Emperor himself, while behind him was Von Lenz 
and another officer. 
‘Go,’ said the Emperor; ‘you are free. Return 
to your countrymen, and tell them that William of 
Germany can be as generous as George of England.’ 
With these words he turned and got into his car 
again, and Von Lenz hurried Oliver and Vivian a 
few yards down the road, where yet another car was 
waiting. 
‘Get in,’ said Von Lenz, and, overcome with 
emotion at the revulsion of feeling, they obeyed ; 
while Von Lenz ran to the front of the car and gave 
the starting-handle a couple of sharp turns. 
‘You can drive, I know,’ he said, returning to | 
the side of the car. ‘Take this letter; it is the 
Emperor’s order to any of our people who stop you, 
to pass you at once to the British lines.’ 
‘But the Emperor,’ said Vivian as he grasped the 
steering-wheel—‘I should like to thank him. I 
should *. 
‘Go; go instantly, before he alters his mind,’ said 
Von Lenz, and, without even shaking hands, he 
ran back to the car in which Oliver and Vivian had 
ridden, and jumping in with the Dragoon officer, 
they dashed away after the first car. 
‘By Jove! the Kaiser has some sporting charac- 
teristics, after all,’ said Oliver. 
‘He’s given us our freedom, at any rate,’ said 
Vivian. ‘Thank God he didn’t give us Iron Crosses 
as well!’ and in another minute he was doing his 
best to put as much distance as he could between 
them and that man of many moods, His Imperial 
Majesty of Germany.   
 
-P-A-G-E-319
  CHAPTER XXXV. 
AT THE LAST GASP. 
‘J TNLESS these beggars satisfy themselves by 
to-morrow that we are really what we say 
we are, I shall get desperate, go for any one who 
tries to stop me, and make a dash for the British 
lines.” Thus spoke Oliver angrily some four days 
after he and Vivian had been released by the 
Germans. 
‘In which case,’ replied Vivian calmly, ‘you will 
probably convince our friends, who, you must 
admit, are delightful hosts, that we are in reality 
spies, and we shall be shot off-hand.’ 
‘You always take everything so beastly coolly, 
Vivian.’ 
‘And I wish I could persuade you to do the same. 
My dear boy, there are two things about which 
it is of no use worrying, as the Italians say—the 
things that you can help, and the things that you 
can’t.’ 
‘And meanwhile our fellows are fighting for their 
very existence; the most critical battle of the war 
is being waged, and we are out of it.’ 
‘True, Noll—which, of course, I am willing to 
admit, is bad for our country.’ 
‘Don’t rot,’ cried Oliver, using an old school 
expression. 
‘I hope I sha’n’t for many a long day,’ replied 
Vivian, purposely taking the literal meaning; ‘but 
in war-time you know’

Oliver gave it up as a bad job. 
After leaving Von Lenz they had made their 
way in the direction they imagined the British 
lines to be. The Emperor's letter procured them 
instant and respectful passage through every German 
post, the officers saluting as they drove off. At last 
they were pulled up by a hostile challenge, and 
found themselves at a post held by a party of 
Tureos. The young French lieutenant in charge 
listened to their tale, offered them cognac and 
cigarettes, said he did not doubt their word for a 
moment, but—they had just come from the German 
lines, and he was obliged to pass them on under 
escort to the base. 
There they had been most courteously received, 
given good quarters in an old chateau, fed and 
lodged well, had plenty of company, many officers: 
dropping in when off duty and smoking or convers- 
ing with them, and they were told that—just as a 
matter of form—they would be asked to remain 
until inquiries had been made at the British head- 
quarters. 
Both Vivian and Oliver had written letters to 
General French and their own commanding officers, 
but four days had passed and they were still 
honoured guests of the French, the only visible sign 
that they were not free to depart at any moment 
being the alert little red-trousered piou-pious 
(infantrymen) who, merely as a matter of form, as 
the officer said, guarded the chateau ! 
Oliver and Vivian were fiercely anxious to regain 
their regiments; for Vivian, in spite of his pre- 
tended calmness, was as eager as Oliver. Great 
deeds were being performed, though of details the
-P-A-G-E-321

lads could learn little, for the French officers would 
talk pleasantly and freely on any topic—save the 
war! | 
Some things, however, they learnt. The position 
on the Aisne had resulted in a deadlock. The 
Germans had so dug themselves in that it was no 
longer open warfare; it’ was a siege. Beyond this 
they heard nothing. 
On the fourth evening a French major, who had 
made himself very agreeable, came into the room 
where Oliver and Vivian were talking with a couple 
of young Frenchmen, and, assuming a mock tragic 
air, said, ‘Alas, my comrades! we are going to lose : 
your pleasant society. Some friends have arrived 
from the British lines to identify you.’ 
‘Thank goodness for that!’ said Oliver. ‘But " 
suppose they don’t identify us, monsieur; you may 
not be able to get rid of us.’ 
‘But yes, my friend; only then the loss to us of 
your society will not be a gain to any one else, for 
the separation willbe caused by our soldiers’ rifles ;’ 
and the major shrugged his shoulders, as though 
apologising for mentioning such an unpleasant 
possibility. 
In another moment two officers entered the room, 
and Oliver and Vivian were being warmly greeted 
by the latter's captain, and by young Hewson of 
the Hussars. 
‘We’d given you up as dead,’ said Vivian’s 
captain, as he heartily shook them by the hand. 
‘Not by long chalks,’ said Vivian. 
The French major, who had kept a sharp eye on 
the meeting, now advanced. ‘Gentlemen,’ he said, 
‘pardon us that we kept you. It hurt me to 
E.K. : X
-P-A-G-E-322
306 AT THE LAST GASP, 
doubt the word of such gallant officers; but what 
would you? You know our friends the Germans, 
and you know how far they can be trusted. One 
of our airmen observed you soon after you left the 
German lines, and we were quite prepared to receive 
you. Then your tale was so—well, shall we say 
so surprising, and your get-up so good, that I 
thought it better for some one from your own army 
to identify you. It has taken a little time, but we 
have tried to make it pass pleasantly. It has at 
least been a rest for you.’ . 
‘Major,’ replied Vivian, ‘not another word; you 
were amply justified, for we were unable to prove 
our statements. But, as we say in English, “all’s 
well that ends well.” ’ 
‘Ah, I regret that I have not the gift of your 
fine, manly language. Some day, if I live through 
the war, I may find some pretty English lady who 
will teach me. But now, my friends, we must 
think only of war, war—always of war !’ 
Coffee and cigarettes were brought in, and then 
Oliver and Vivian climbed into the car that had 
brought their friends, and the major shook their 
hands. 
‘Adieu, my comrades, he said; ‘adieu! It 
would have been a thousand pities to have had you 
shot, had you turned out to be—other than British 
.officers. But there, war is exceedingly unpleasant ;’ 
and saluting, he waved his hand lightly and re- 
entered the house, humming a gay little chansonnette 
of the Opéra Comique. 
“And now what is the situation?’ asked Vivian 
as they started off. 
‘Serious,’ said Hewson gravely. ‘First, our lines  
-P-A-G-E-323
  AT THE LAST GASP. 807 
are miles from here. The fact of the Germans 
sending you in this direction, expecting you to find 
your countrymen, proves that for once we have 
outwitted them. We quietly gave over our trenches 
on the Aisne to the French, retired on Paris once 
more, and were then sent on by train to the neigh- 
bourhood of Lille.’ 
‘The deuce! Why so?’ 
‘Because the Allied line did not extend beyond 
Lille, leaving a gap of fifty miles between that and 
the open sea. This gap commanded the routes to 
Dunkirk, Calais, and Boulogne, the most important 
Channel ports. Besides, it is an easy road to 
Paris.’ 
‘True; but it is covered by Antwerp. So long 
as the Belgians hold that, the Germans dare not 
risk leaving it behind them.’ 
‘Antwerp fell to the Germans on 8th October,’ 
said Hewson. 
‘Phew!’ whistled Vivian; ‘that’s serious. How 
did it happen ?’ 
‘Simply the Belgians were not strong enough to 
hold it. A Naval Brigade was sent from England, 
but it was too late. The men did what they could, 
covered the retreat of the Belgian Army, and then 
retired ; but some were trapped, and got interned 
in Holland. Since then the Germans have made a 
terrific swoop to try to cut off the remainder of 
the Belgian Army, but by hard fighting, assisted by 
the French and British, it has managed to reach 
Ypres; and practically since then we have been at 
it hammer-and-tongs, the Germans straining every 
nerve to get through to Calais, we trying to hurl 
them back. But it’s a hard task, and every day
-P-A-G-E-324
  808 AT THE LAST GASP. 
sees fresh hordes of them arriving, while we get 
weaker.’ 
‘If the enemy gets Calais, it means that our chief 
naval bases are within his reach. It gives him a 
valuable jumping-off position for his aircraft, and 
Chatham, Dover, and Portsmouth will be visited, 
London will be in danger from Zeppelins and Taubes, 
and an invasion of our east coast is almost inevit- 
able,’ said Vivian. ; 
‘No one realises this more clearly than Sir John 
French; he has attacked and attacked, and with 
the French and Belgians we have captured the 
Mont des Cats and pushed on twenty miles to 
Armentitres, where we must hold on. If French’s 
effort succeeds, he will have achieved the well-nigh 
impossible ; if he doesn’t—well, I fancy he will find 
a grave here with the majority of us, for it’s 
conquer or die with us this time.’ 
They reached the end of their journey quite 
safely, but very late at night. In the morning 
they had the honour of breakfasting with Sir John 
French, who listened to their strange tale, and 
complimented them on their escape. 
‘You ’re exceedingly welcome,’ he said, ‘for every 
man is now of the utmost value. I shall keep both 
of you for a day or two on my staff, for I regret 
to say many of my most enthusiastic workers have 
given their lives for their country.’ 
For two days Oliver and Vivian were at head- 
quarters, where every half-hour messages from the 
front, announcing various results, came in. Hourly 
the position of the British grew more critical. 
Always the Germans rushed through on the Belgian 
railways in countless legions, and pressed on and
-P-A-G-E-325
AT THE LAST GASP. 309 
on, ever trying to outflank the British line. To 
obviate this the 2nd and 8rd Corps had to extend 
farther and farther, until their line was so thin 
that it was perilously near to breaking. And 
always the Germans shelled and hammered at the 
thin line, sending on their best battalions in the 
most reckless fashion, only to be mown down and 
driven back time after time. But the German 
attacks were like the sea-waves washing around a 
castle of sand on the beach ; each time they advanced 
they weakened the castle, and though they receded, 
they advanced again with more force, so that it 
was only a question of time before they washed 
completely over the castle and destroyed it. 
One morning a telephone message came in from 
the commander of the 8rd Corps. ‘ We are hardly 
pressed,’ it said, ‘and must have reinforcements. 
It is impossible to hold out much longer.’ 
. ‘Go to him, Mr Hastings,’ said General French, 
‘and tell him I want only men who can perform 
the impossible. He must hold on.’ 
Oliver went, and saw the mud-covered, blood- 
stained men, with bloodshot eyes and unshaven 
faces, who had been holding ten times their number 
at bay day and night for two hundred hours on 
stretch. 
When Oliver reached the division it was being 
subjected to a positively appalling shelling. The 
enormous high-explosive shells, which the Tommies 
eall ‘Jack Johnsons’ and ‘coal-boxes,’ were bursting 
on all sides, shrapnel-bullets seemed literally to ° 
rain, and the shattered and maimed men had to lie 
where they fell, for to attempt to advance over the 
shell-riven area meant certain death. When Oliver 
 
-P-A-G-E-326
  310 AT THE LAST GASP. 
gave the General his message his superior officer 
shrugged his shoulders. 
‘Sir John knows we shall do all that mortal 
men can do,’ he said, ‘and we shall die where we 
fight, if need be. But the gallant, big-hearted lads 
—I should have liked to save them. They have 
fought like heroes, and they look to me to save 
them. I would if I could; but when the Germans 
make their next big attack, for which this shelling 
is the preparation, I doubt whether we shall be able 
to drive them back. My boys are spent;’ and 
there was a suspicious huskiness in the great man’s 
voice as he spoke. 
Presently the shell-fire died down, and the General, 
through his glasses, saw the gray masses advancing 
to the attack. ‘I am going down to encourage the 
men,’ he said. 
‘And, if you will allow me, I will accompany 
you,’ said Oliver. 
‘As you like; every man tells;’ and together 
they made their way through the traverses, often 
knee-deep in mud, until they reached the advanced 
trenches. 
Seeing the General, the men, exhausted as they 
were, gave a cheer, and the General replied with a 
cheery nod. 
‘Now, lads,’ he said, ‘one more effort.’ 
‘All right,’ replied a man; ‘we’re ready. We’ve 
seen enough o’ the work o’ these blighters among 
the women and kids to make us fight to the last 
breath to keep ’em out of Old England.’ 
Then they opened fire. It was the old thing 
over again: the steady advance in close formation ; 
the withering volleys; the sweeping away of the
-P-A-G-E-327
  AT THE LAST GASP. 311 
ranks ; the filling of the gaps; the officers, with the 
everlasting ery of ‘ Vorwirts! vorwdrts!’ driving 
on the men like cattle, or shooting from behind 
those who faltered; the reserve battalions rushing 
to take the places of those who had been killed ; 
and the final bayonet charge driving the Germans 
helter-skelter before it. 
But that day the first attack was succeeded by 
a second, and that by a third, all of which were 
driven off, when the shelling was renewed with 
greater violence than before. : 
Trenches were blown in, burying men; shrapnel 
rained down until it seemed as if nothing could live 
in the trenches. Then more attacks were delivered, 
and up sprang the British again to repel them, one 
man starting singing, ‘Here we are, here we are, 
here we are again’ 
This time the Germans did not wait for the 
bayonet; they broke and fled, falling over heaps 
of their own dead. The exhausted British, before 
their rifles were cool, dropped in the trenches by 
the score, and in a few moments were fast asleep, 
being awakened with difficulty to repel the last 
attack. 
As it was getting dusk the General, Oliver with 
him, retired to his quarters on a slight rise some 
two miles from the advanced trenches. 
When he was giving Oliver a message for the 
Commander-in-Chief, the young lieutenant saw a 
solitary cloaked and turbaned figure riding over 
a hill just in the rear. Quickly he was followed 
by the nodding turbans of a squadron of Sikh 
cavalry, and then a battalion came swinging along. 
‘Indians !’ cried Oliver excitedly. 
    
-P-A-G-E-328
312 AT THE LAST GASP. 
‘Thank God!’ exclaimed the General as an officer 
galloped up to him to report; ‘thank God! Now 
I can give my men a few hours’ rest;’ and that 
night several native battalions were used as a relief 
for the men of the 8rd Corps, who had been taxed 
to the last ounce that was in them. 
 
-P-A-G-E-329
  
CHAPTER XXXVI 
THE CRISIS OF YPRES. 
T Indian contingent came into the firing-line 
at a critical moment. The help they rendered 
was invaluable; but even with that the British had 
a grim task to hold the Huns at bay. Their attack 
rocked from point to point, and was conducted with 
great skill by their Generals, and pushed home with 
the most stubborn bravery by the men. To say 
that they met their masters in the British is to pay 
our gallant troops the highest compliment possible. 
For a fortnight the British and the French fought 
day and night without cessation; the fortune of 
war was sometimes with them, sometimes against 
them. During that time both good and bad news 
reached them. The Russians had gained a big 
success, stopped Von Hindenburg’s rush on Warsaw, 
and hurled him back with immense loss; but, on 
the other hand, Colonel Maritz had turned traitor, 
and Britain was face to face with rebellion in South 
Africa, 
Oliver had rejoined his regiment, but Vivian was 
doing service with the aircraft division, for it was 
of the utmost importance to get every scrap of 
information about the enemy’s movements, and, by 
meeting him in the air and attacking him, prevent 
him from learning anything about the British 
movements, 
Oliver’s regiment was enjoying a short spell of 
rest one misty, drizzling morning, when a fellow-
-P-A-G-E-330
  814 THE ORISIS OF YPRES. 
officer cried out, ‘Look here, Hastings; here’s a 
damaged aeroplane coming down, and pretty quickly, 
too. Look out, or it will be on top of some of 
us!’ 
Those near gathered together and watched the 
machine, clearly a British one, planing down, but 
with one wing hanging and wobbling so that 
it seemed as if every instant the machine would 
turn turtle and crash to the ground. Managed 
with great skill, however, by its pilot, it reached 
the ground, and Oliver, with several others, ran 
forward just as the pilot, looking pale and agitated, 
scrambled from his seat. 
‘Had a near shave!’ exclaimed one of Oliver’s 
companions, looking at the shrapnel-riddled wing. 
‘It isn’t that; it’s the enemy. They ’re coming 
on in tens of thousands. The country is covered 
with them like ants; the batteries are legion; the 
whole country is black with cavalry. Nothing but 
a miracle can save our 1st Division.’ 
At the first sound of his voice Oliver had 
recognised Vivian. ‘You, old chap!’ he cried. 
‘Why, you look done up.’ 
‘Get me a mouthful of brandy, Noll, and I shall 
be all right. My mechanic was killed, and I had 
a narrow escape. But not a moment must be lost; 
I must make my report;’ and in a few minutes 
away he went, leaving his broken machine where 
it was. 
In less than half-an-hour Oliver was in the 
saddle, off with the cavalry division, some 4500 
strong, to engage and hold in check an army corps 
of 40,000! 
As they went along at the trot the sound of the
-P-A-G-E-331
  THE CRISIS OF YPRES. 315 
guns in front grew louder, and their experienced 
ears caught the deep ‘boom’ of the German 13-inch 
howitzer among the lighter guns. 
‘The 1st Division are having a rough tine of it,’ 
said Oliver to his companion; ‘for the last ten 
days they ’ve been constantly hammered.’ 
‘True; but Sir Douglas Haig is one who can 
hammer back. After French, he’s the finest General 
out here by a long chalk ;’ and being a cavalryman 
himself, Oliver at once agreed. 
‘Hallo! what’s this?’ he said later, as a long 
line of motor ambulance-wagons came past. ‘Have 
they left their base ?’ 
It soon turned out that they had, and the reason 
was that the German artillery and a massed infantry 
attack had broken the first corps of the 1st Division 
near Ypres, and that it was retreating. 
‘Forward, my lads!’ cried Oliver's colonel. ‘We’re 
wanted ;’ and away they went. 
Soon the cavalry came in sight of the battle, 
and the whole country seemed alive with masses 
of gray-green men. The rain of shells and bullets 
defies description ; the air seemed alive with them. 
The noise was appalling, and above all now and 
then were heard the fierce shouts as opposing masses 
closed in the last final struggle. 
The cavalry went farther up into the firing-line 
and dismounted, when they opened fire on the 
hordes of the enemy. Soon an officer came galloping 
up. ‘Would the General send a squadron? The 
Scots Fusiliers had held their ground too long 
before retiring, and had been surrounded. Nothing 
but a cavalry charge could save them.’ 
‘I can spare one regiment only,’ replied the
-P-A-G-E-332
316 THE ORISIS OF YPRES. 
General; and in three minutes the Twelfth were 
racing forward. 
The survivors of the Fusiliers were surrounded 
by dense masses of infantry, but back to back they 
were holding out. ‘They had made up their minds 
to die before surrendering. But the Twelfth, with 
a rousing cheer, bore down on the Teutons, and 
rode through them with great slaughter. Closing 
up their thinned ranks, they charged again, and 
then the Germans ran. But a regiment of Dragoons 
charged down upon the Twelfth, and the Lancers 
had to fight for their lives. The Scots Fusiliers, 
rescued for the minute, took breath, closed up their 
ranks, and then, taking wonderful aim, picked off 
the officers of the Dragoons, and, delivering an 
enfilading fire, so harried them that the Lancers 
overthrew them, and the survivors galloped off. 
Then the Twelfth, under a terrific artillery fire, 
covered the retreat of the Fusiliers, less than 300 
out of 1100! 
But yet another German army corps was advanc- 
ing against the British 1st Division, and the cavalry 
were hurried off to hold it in check. Hour after 
hour it manceuvred, always under a cruel artillery 
fire, now from what shelter it could seize pouring 
in an effective rifle-fire, then mounting and charging 
small parties, once even the whole division having 
to meet a cavalry charge by four times its own 
number. Then the division was split up into 
regiments, and attacking here and there, kept those 
40,000 German cavalry so busy that they were 
unable to dash in and deal Sir Douglas Haig the 
blow that was to crush him completely when the 
infantry had subdued him.
-P-A-G-E-333
THE CRISIS OF YPRES, 817 
The French had also fallen back, and the British 
had lost Gheluvelt. But the sacrifice of the cavalry 
had not been in vain. Sir Douglas Haig had taken 
up a new position, and was disputing every inch 
with the Germans. The cavalry were retired to 
protect the flank, and Oliver found himself in a 
wood where the Guardsmen were making a superb 
stand. The cry was always ‘Reinforcements!’ 
‘Reinforcements!’ but, alas! there was not a man 
to send. 
‘Hold on, men! Hold on, for God’s sake !’ eried 
a captain near Oliver. ‘There’s nothing behind 
us; we’re all that’s between them and Calais. 
Think of our dear ones at home; the enemy must 
not break through !’ 
Oliver’s squadron was dismounted, and they fought 
side by side with the Guards. Ding-dong, to and 
fro, the fight waged, the Germans fighting with a 
settled determination to win or die; and in such 
numbers were they that little by little the British 
had to give way, in spite of all they could do. 
They were almost at the.edge of the small wood 
they were holding; once driven out of that, they 
would be mown down by machine-guns, and the 
platoon officers did everything to encourage the men 
to hold on, dying with the most devoted courage 
as an example. ; 
Guards and Lancers, however, fell back when a 
motor-car pulled up on the edge of the wood, and 
a short, square-shouldered man jumped out and ad- 
vanced into the wood, just as a Lancer, shot through 
the brain, with a cry threw up his arms and fell 
backward. ‘The short officer caught the dying man 
in his arms, and laid him gently on the ground ;
-P-A-G-E-334
318 THE CRISIS OF YPRES. 
then, running forward, cried to the men, ‘A little 
longer, my brave lads; a little longer. The tide’s 
turning. Hang on for the sake of the Old Country. 
Remember Belgium, and don’t give an inch,’ 
The words seemed to send an electric thrill through 
the almost exhausted men. Some one turned round, 
recognised the Commander-in-Chief, and cried, ‘It’s 
Sir John, here with us! Hurrah, boys; let’s show 
him !’ and with a sudden rush they sprang forward ; 
seeing which, the Germans, thinking they had been 
reinforced, fell back, were driven from the wood, 
and the line there was safe. 
A dozen times during that crucial day, wherever 
the line was in danger of giving way, Sir John 
French himself, risking his life over and over again, 
was there, with voice and example to stimulate the 
glorious courage of the British soldier. And so 
the line held and night fell. The greatest attack 
the Germans had ever made failed, Calais was saved, 
and with it perhaps even Britain itself. Regiments 
that had been 1100 strong in the morning numbered 
only 800, the cavalry division was just half its 
strength, but not one of the heroes who that night 
sank down to rest thought that he had that’ day 
fought in a battle, had helped to win a victory, 
with results more far-reaching than the battles of 
Blenheim or Waterloo. 
And nothing recked those 10,000 dead Britons, 
as they lay taking their long rest. They had done 
their duty.
-P-A-G-E-335
CHAPTER XXXVIL 
THE END OF A PRUSSIAN BULLY. 
[? was not until two days after the great battle 
of the 31st October that Oliver and Vivian met. 
Vivian said that air reconnaissance had revealed 
50,000 fresh German troops pouring through Belgium 
to the fighting-line, and spies reported that they 
were the picked soldiers of Prussia—the much- 
vaunted Guards battalions. 
From spies, too, it was learnt that the Kaiser 
himself had come with his Prussian Guards; that 
he had commanded them, ‘at any cost,’ to break 
the Allies’ line and drive them from the last corner 
of Belgium. It was also asserted that he then 
intended formally to annex Belgium, and the cere- 
mony was to take place in the famous Cloth Hall 
of Ypres. But the British had been consider- 
ably reinforced by the French, and by some fresh 
battalions from England; so that when, on the 
morning of 15th November, another terrible massed 
attack was made, they found the Allies better pre- 
pared to meet it. 
The same dense masses moved forward to be 
mown down, even the British officers firing with 
the rifle until it was too hot to hold. But the 
Prussian Guards were fighting under the eye of the 
‘War Lord,’ and nothing could surpass their superb 
bravery that day except—the superb bravery of the 
British. 
Oliver and Vivian, who knew most of the German 
 
-P-A-G-E-336
  320 THE END OF A PRUSSIAN BULLY. 
regiments, recognised the King’s and Queen’s Grena- 
dier Guards regiments, the famous Garde-Jager 
regiment, and the Foot Guards. 
The cavalry on that day, as it very frequently 
did, fought with the infantry, and Oliver’s regiment 
was with Vivian’s company of Coldstreams. 
Towards evening, when the ‘German attack was 
everywhere being pushed back, Oliver and Vivian, 
with about fifty men, were pursuing through a wood 
a number of the Queen’s Grenadier regiment, to 
which Falkenberg belonged. Oliver was thinking 
of him, and wondering whether he had so far come 
safely through, when from a clump of trees on their 
left a sharp volley rang out, and several Coldstreams 
fell. 
‘There ’s a party of the enemy there,’ cried Vivian ; 
‘put in a couple of rounds, men, and then at ’em 
with the bayonet.’ 
For a minute there was a hot fire from both sides ; 
then the Guardsmen dashed amongst the trees, and 
a number of hand-to-hand bayonet combats took 
place. The Germans would not surrender, and fought 
most stubbornly. A big officer encouraged them. 
‘Kill the dogs, or be killed yourselves !’ he cried. 
‘Don’t surrender to paid murderers who fight for 
so much a day.’ 
Both Oliver and Vivian at once recognised Falken- 
berg, and Vivian cried, ‘Doubtless you prefer your 
soldiers to pay themselves by looting, after the 
example of your Crown Prince.’ 
‘You lie!’ shouted Falkenberg. 
“You lie yourself, Prussian bully, for I’ve seen 
your men robbing our dead.’ 
‘ How you come to be alive now to talk of it is
-P-A-G-E-337
THE END OF A PRUSSIAN BULLY. 321 
more than I can understand,’ said Falkenberg, who 
evidently did not know how Vivian and Oliver had 
secured their freedom. 
‘No; you did your best to get us shot; but you 
see you failed.’ 
‘I'll make sure of you both this time;’ and 
Falkenberg made a cut at Oliver. 
Their swords crossed, and for a moment they 
lunged furiously at one another. Vivian feared for 
Oliver, and not without cause, for Falkenberg made 
a sweeping cut at him, which Oliver parried; but 
such was the force of the German’s blow that Oliver’s 
sword was dashed from his hand. 
Falkenberg, jumping back, with his left hand 
snatched a revolver from his holster, and was about 
to fire almost in Oliver’s face, when Vivian, crying, 
‘No, you don’t, my boy,’ struck Falkenberg a smart 
blow on the wrist with his sword. 
One of the Coldstreams, seeing the attempt to 
shoot Oliver, made a rush at Falkenberg with his 
fixed bayonet. 
But Vivian stopped him. ‘Don’t interfere,’ he 
said. Then to Falkenberg, ‘You are alone. Sur- 
render !’ ‘ 
Falkenberg saw that his men had either been 
killed or had surrendered, and he said savagely, 
‘No; I will fight.’ 
‘Come on, then,’ cried Oliver; and having re- 
gained his sword, he engaged, and by a fortunate 
thrust ran him through the right arm. 
Falkenberg dropped his sword, which a private 
picked up, saying in English, ‘You’ve put up a 
good fight, German. Now hands up!’ 
Falkenberg immediately obeyed, and the Guards-

man advanced to take the revolver which the Prussian 
still held in his left hand, when he suddenly lowered 
it and fired two shots at Oliver. The first missed 
altogether, but the second struck the man who was 
advancing to take his revolver, and with a moan 
he fell. 
The sight of so dastardly a deed enraged the 
soldiers around, and before Vivian could say a word 
to stop them, half-a-dozen bayonets were buried in 
Falkenberg’s body. As he lay on the ground, with 
the life-blood welling from him, he turned a look 
of bitter enmity at Vivian and Oliver, and faintly 
endeavoured to raise the revolver, which he still held 
in his left hand, and fire a farewell shot at the 
hated English. 
‘A typical Prussian bully,’ said Vivian, as they 
turned away. 
‘Yes; it is a pity so much brutality should be 
combined with so much pluck,’ said Oliver. ‘But 
I suppose it’s the outcome of their training.’ 
The battle by that time was almost over. That 
night the Kaiser knew he would not annex Belgium 
just yet; that there would be no ceremony in the 
Cloth Hall; and that, when there was, it could not 
be attended by all the pomp he had intended, for 
the greater part of his show soldiers, his celebrated 
Guards, lay out in the woods, sometimes in ranks 
eight-deep, dead and stiff and cold.  
-P-A-G-E-339
CHAPTER XXXVIIL 
A DUEL IN THE AIR. 
oS hurrah! hurrah!’ Three wild 
cheers rolled down the ranks; the troopers 
waved their lances, the officers their caps. 
‘One little one more,’ eried some one, and a 
louder cheer than ever rang out. 
Oliver’s regiment was drawn up on the side of 
the road, which was churned up fetlock-deep in 
mud. The wintry sun was shining, but a keen, 
cutting wind was blowing, that made the troopers 
shiver in their cloaks. 
The cheers were for a small, spare man with 
white moustache, who had just passed along their 
ranks, In answer to their cheers he gravely saluted, 
then with a few cheery words and a ‘God bless you 
all!’ passed on. 
The small man was the greatest soldier of the 
age, Field-Marshal Lord Roberts. 
Drawn to France by the presence there of his 
beloved Indian troops, who loved him as he loved 
them, he had passed on a tour of inspection through 
the various army corps. : 
‘Wonderful old man!’ said Oliver to Vivian next 
morning as they discussed the event. ‘I have 
always been anxious to see him, but I little thought 
where and under what circumstances my wish would 
be gratified.’ 
“You never know your luck, you see,’ replied 
Vivian, who, as well as Oliver, was off duty that
-P-A-G-E-340

day. ‘Had Great Britain taken Lord Roberts’s 
advice we shouldn’t be in the mess we are.’ 
‘Well, it’s no good talking about that now.’ 
‘Not a bit. Come over to the flying lines; there 
are one or two fellows there I want to see.’ 
In the flying lines they found only one machine, 
and that was slightly damaged. A mechanic was 
busy with it; and, greatly interested in all sorts 
of machinery, Vivian was soon helping him with 
wrench and spanner. 
Oliver strolled away, leaving Vivian to himself, 
as the mechanical part did not appeal to him. 
Sitting on a pile of cordage was an old cavalry 
sergeant, who jumped up and saluted as Oliver 
approached him, at the same time taking his pipe 
from his mouth. 
‘Sit down,’ said Oliver, ‘and keep on your pipe. 
Every man has earned the right here to a smoke 
and a seat when he gets the chance.’ 
‘Yes, sir, I believe you’re right,’ said the sergeant ; 
‘but these ’ere new soldiers do seem to take it a 
bit easy, if you understand what I mean. Not 
that they ain’t the finest fighters I ever see, but 
they ’ve got no smartness. Now, when I was a 
“rookie,” to ha’ passed an orficer without salutin’ 
would have meant seven days C.B.’ 
Oliver looked at the old soldier. ‘That was some 
days ago, I guess, sergeant,’ he said. 
‘Ay, you may well say so, sir; afore you was 
born, I know. It was in the year of the first 
Jubilee of Queen Victoria—God bless her !—that I 
took the shilling. I’ve seen service in India, Egypt, 
and the Cape. I ain’t got no business to be ’ere. 
I was on pension long afore this affair broke out;
-P-A-G-E-341
A DUEL IN THE AIR. 325 
but when I ’eard as the old regiment wanted men— 
well, I couldn’t ’ang back, that’s straight; and ’ere 
I am, as served ‘is grandmother, doin’ a bit for 
King George.’ 
‘I suppose you find this war different from your 
other campaigns ?’ 
‘Lor’ bless you, sir! they was picnics—just 
pleasant picnics. If I’d ha’ known what fightin’ 
these ’ere Germans meant, I’d ha’—I’d ha’’. 
and the sergeant stopped, as though at a loss for 
a word, 
‘You ’d have what ?’ 
‘I’d ha’ brought a dozen other “old swots” [old 
soldiers] with me. We want ’em all, every man, to 
beat these brutes.’ 
‘You haven’t got much opinion of the Germans, 
then ?’ ; 
‘Germans ?’ said the sergeant scornfully. ‘ Dogs, 
I call ’em. Pluck they’ve got—that you can’t 
deny ; but fools they are. ‘No sense, no nous; just 
advancin’ and advancin’ more like a mob leavin’ a 
football-ground than like soldiers. And all this ’ere 
firin’ from the ‘ip; they can’t shoot for nuts, sir, 
and they won’t face the bay’nit.’ 
‘Perhaps it’s a good thing they won't, else you 
and I might not be here to-day.’ 
‘True enough, sir; but they ’ll never get the best 
out of these Germans so long as their orficers treat 
’em like dogs, and worse than dogs. The German 
orficer is a bully and a brute who ain’t got no notion 
of playin’ the game. You know what we’ve seen 
in Belgium and ’ere in France too; and all the devil- 
ments done by the soldiers was ordered by the 
orficers.’  
-P-A-G-E-342
  326 A DUEL IN THE AIR. 
‘I’m afraid there’s some truth in what you say, 
sergeant.’ 
‘Sure there is. Them Uhlans is the worst of all, 
too. Lor, ’ow we did let into ’em at Compidgne! 
Was you in that scrap, sir?’ 
‘Yes.’ 
‘Do you remember how we charged them Uhlans 
and broke ’em like chaff? They galloped for their 
lives, and ’owled like pariah dogs for mercy. They 
didn’t get much from me. I’d seen something that 
day that had made me swear never to spare another 
German, and when we off-saddled at night, me and 
the mare, sir—well, we might ha’ been slaughterin’ 
pigs all day, by the look of us. Bah! it makes me 
sick ;’ and the sergeant wiped his mouth with the 
back of his hand. 
‘Let’s hope they ’re not all bad, sergeant.’ 
‘No, perhaps they ain’t. And that reminds me of 
a thing as ’appened only yesterday. We was out 
right away the other side of the canal, when we 
spies a squadron of Hussars, on the lookout like we 
was. Our captain gave the word, and we were into 
’em in two minutes in fine style. We made short 
work of ’em, and I found myself opposite a young 
orficer. Quite a good-lookin’ chap, ’e was, for a 
German ; not such a beastly fat pig as most of ’em 
are. Well, ’e come at me with ’is sword, but I just 
waited and let ’im ’ave a thrust with my lance, but 
’e parried it, and let rip a back-’anded cut at me, 
that, if I ’adn’t been an old tournament ’and, would 
’ave cut me out of my saddle. But I lay forward 
on the mare’s neck and let ’im ’ave oné backwards 
with the butt-end of the lance in the ribs that must 
ha’ knocked the wind out of ’im. But ’e faced
-P-A-G-E-343
A DUEL IN THE AIR. 827 
about, and we spurred round one another till one of 
the swines o’ troopers sneaked up and let rip at me 
with a rifle, but missed me and ’it the mare. She 
went down, and I with ’er, when the German came 
at me; but the orficer shouted something in ’is 
gibberish, and the beggar sloped. Then the orficer 
says to me, in as good English as I spoke myself’ 
(Oliver wondered whether it might not even have 
been a little better), “There’s a sword on your 
horse, sergeant ; let’s finish our little affair.” But I 
didn’t want no sword; I’d still got my lance; and 
I attacked ‘im with that, and presently ran ‘im 
through the right arm, when ’e dropped ’is sword. 
Then runnin’ in on ’is left side, I gives ‘is leg a 
sudden lift and ’iked ’im clean out of ’is saddle. 
«“Now then,” I said, as I put my lance-point on 
is chest, “’ands up or you’re a goner.” 
‘« Kill me,” says ’e; “I don’t want to live.” 
*“JT don’t kill a man in cold blood,” I replies. 
“You ’ve played the game for once, and I’m goin’ to 
spare yer life and take you prisoner. And don’t be 
afraid; we don’t kill our prisoners, as you chaps think.” 
‘Blest if ’e didn’t burst out larfin’, and say ’e 
knew the English methods well enough to know 
all such tales were rot. Well, the end of it was I 
made ‘im prisoner, got ‘is arm bound up, and ’e 
offers me some money. I refused it, of course; but 
I asked ’im if ’e’d mind givin’ me the badge off ’is 
busby, which was a skull and cross-bones, same as my 
brother’s old regiment, the 17th Lancers. “*E at once 
’ands me the whole busby, and we got quite chatty.’ 
‘He must have belonged to the Death’s Head 
Hussars.” 
‘That’s it, sir; and ’e did tell me ’is name.’ 
   
-P-A-G-E-344
328 A DUEL IN THE AIR. 
‘What was it ?’ 
‘Oh lor! I’ve forgot. Some foreign name, it 
was; put me in mind of telescopes and cameras and 
sech like.’ 
‘It must have been a. funny name,’ said Oliver, 
laughing. 
‘Well, it was the name of one of the parts, you 
know.’ 
Oliver made several guesses, till he ‘suddenly 
thought of lens, 
‘That’s it,’ said the sergeant—‘ lens.’ 
‘Lenz?’ cried Oliver excitedly. ‘Ludwig von 
Lenz? Was that it ?’ 
‘Captain von Lenz,’ the sergeant said. 
‘Why, he’s an old friend of mine,’ cried Oliver. 
‘Where did you leave him ?’ 
‘With the other prisoners;’ and the sergeant 
gave Oliver all the information he could. 
‘But, lor, sir,’ said the sergeant, ‘’e was just 
one; the rest is mainly bad. Now look at this ’ere 
Zeppelin business, a-flyin’ over unfortified towns, 
droppin’ bombs on women and kiddies, and—why, 
speak of the devil, sir, and—look there!’ and the 
sergeant pointed upwards. 
Oliver looked up, and saw coming towards them 
an enormous Zeppelin. In an instant he started off 
at top speed to Vivian. 
‘Vivian! Vivian!’ he shouted. ‘Look; there’s 
a Zepp!’ 
‘I’ve seen her,’ said Vivian tensely, ‘and I’m 
going after her.’ 
For a minute he seemed to fly round the aero- 
plane he had been working on; then the engine was 
started.
-P-A-G-E-345
A DUEL IN THE AIR. 329 
‘There ’s no flight officer here,’ he said, ‘and I’m 
going up. Coming, Noll ?’ t 
‘Rather ;’ and in five minutes they were rushing 
along the ground, just lifting into the air. 
At first Vivian went straight ahead, his planes 
inclined so as to lift him; then he veered in a circle, 
but always kept in front of the Zeppelin. 
With a roar and a rattle they climbed higher and 
higher; while the Zeppelin, getting nearer, loomed 
immense above them in the air. Behind her Vivian 
and Oliver saw an aeroplane coming at full speed. 
‘What is she?’ asked Oliver. ‘Not a German, 
surely ?” 
‘Looks like a British machine,’ said Vivian 
shortly, as he continued to climb. 
The second aeroplane passed the Zeppelin, and 
then, to Oliver’s surprise, the pilot fired two shots, 
one of which narrowly missed him. 
‘She can’t be German,’ shouted Vivian. ‘Wave 
your arms at her, Oliver.’ 
Oliver did so, and then saw that the occupants 
were French. More shots were fired, and Vivian 
growled angrily, ‘Fools! They blaze away at any- 
thing without waiting to think. Fire at the 
Zeppelin, Noll. That'll show the Frenchmen we ’re 
not enemies.’ 
Oliver did so, and the French at once ceased 
firing. By this time the machine was on a level 
with the cars of the Zeppelin, which were full of 
Germans. These began firing, and Vivian took his 
machine alongside, while Oliver emptied his auto- 
matic pistol amongst the Germans. 
As they went past, their speed being much 
greater than that of the Germans, Oliver noticed 
 
-P-A-G-E-346
RE ee Te eRe a ee ee or 
330 A DUEL IN THE AIR, 
the officer in the front car. It was Dous himself, 
and he had a short rifle in his hand. Oliver 
| shouted the fact to Vivian, who, bringing his 
| machine a bit higher, got above the cars and out 
of reach of fire. For some distance they flew 
alongside the enormous bulk, and Oliver fired 
several shots right into it; but they seemed to 
have no effect. 
‘They can’t harm us, nor we them,’ cried Oliver. 
‘Wait, replied Vivian, and he got above the 
Zeppelin, which was manceuvring about, trying to 
avoid the aeroplanes, which buzzed round her like a 
couple of wasps round a huge bird of prey. One of 
the Frenchmen kept on firing, his bullets whistling 
about round the British aeroplane as freely as round 
the German. 
‘That fellow will settle us if we don’t look out,’ 
cried Vivian. ‘Why the dickens aren’t they a bit 
more careful ?’ 
It was clear that the Zeppelin was making 
strenuous efforts to get back to the German lines, 
and to draw the two aeroplanes with her, and 
Vivian shot suddenly ahead in order to intercept 
her. 
The French pilot divined Vivian’s intention, and 
followed suit. Vivian, getting above the Zeppelin, 
turned and faced the huge airship, when the French- 
man, apparently determined not to be outdone by 
the Briton, turned also, and setting his engines at 
full speed, charged at the Zeppelin. The German, 
by clever steering, just missed the propeller and 
struck the wing of the French machine, badly 
damaging it, at the same time firing a regular 
volley. Instantly the Frenchman began to drop; 
 
-P-A-G-E-347
A DUEL IN THE AIR, 331 
and Vivian, looking down, saw the machine was so 
badly damaged that it would be of no further use 
in the fight. Getting over it, the Zeppelin dropped 
a couple of bombs, which, however, missed their 
mark, owing to the wobbling of the Frenchman. 
‘That’s our chance—a bomb,’ said Vivian, and 
climbing above the airship once more, he turned round 
and flew just over her. Oliver saw that the enormous 
case was covered with a fine wire mesh, and was 
constructed so that a bomb falling on it would roll 
off. There was also the danger of missing the 
Zeppelin, when the bombs would do a lot of damage 
on the ground below, amongst British or French 
troops. 
‘There are four bombs with time-fuses,’ said 
Vivian ; ‘set them to three seconds, and when I am 
well over the beggar let ’em go.’ 
The Zeppelin, in order to avoid bombs, was zig- 
zagging her course, but Vivian kept her well under- 
neath ; whereupon the Zeppelin tried to rise, but 
her efforts were unavailing, and only proved her 
clumsiness. 
Getting into position, Vivian cried, ‘Now,’ and 
Oliver released the first bomb. It exploded’ wide, 
and number two was dropped. That hit the 
Zeppelin and rolled off, exploding well below, 
whether doing any damage or not it was not 
possible to say. Three and four had no more 
success, and a mocking shout from the Germans 
was heard. 
‘I'll drop close down to her,’ said Vivian savagely, 
‘then let go the percussion-bombs. Don’t bother 
about us; blow the lot to Kingdom Come, so long 
as we finish the Zeppelin.’
-P-A-G-E-348
  332 A DUEL IN THE AIR, 
Oliver set his teeth, and they got closer down to 
the great gas envelope, on the top of which a small 
gun was mounted, which a man was preparing to 
fire. A vivid flash and a bang convinced Oliver of 
their danger. He let his bombs go, one, two, three, 
all missing. He released number four. It struck 
the gun; there was a deafening roar, a fearful flash, 
then—bang ! bang ! bang !—three terrific explosions, 
and sheets of intensely hot, red flames sprang from 
the Zeppelin, blinding and scorching. 
Oliver shut his eyes and felt the machine wob- 
bling about. Ina few moments he opened them 
again, to see that one of the wings of the aeroplane 
was on fire, and that below them, in a mass of fire, 
the Zeppelin, her ribs shining black through the 
flames, was falling to the ground, some of the 
occupants flinging themselves from the cars to escape 
the horrible fate of being burned to death. 
Vivian stuck heroically to his post, but they were 
approaching the ground at a great rate, Shouting 
and cheering fell upon their ears as they got closer 
to the earth, but Oliver took little notice. He had 
been badly burned, and the next thing he knew was 
meeting the ground with a severe bump, and then 
of being lifted from the machine by a crowd of 
excited Frenchmen. 
‘Vivent les Anglaises! Vivent notre braves 
alliés !’ yelled the crowd. 
‘How are you, old chap ?’ asked Vivian, support- 
ing Oliver's head. 
‘A bit shaken. I shall be all right if these 
fellows will leave off shouting.’ 
A sip from the flask of a Tureo revived him, 
and all made for the spot where the remains of
-P-A-G-E-349
A DUEL IN THE AIR, 333 
the Zeppelin lay. It was simply a huge mass of 
twisted ribs, aluminium, and cinders. Several 
bodies, scorched and crushed, lay among the débris, 
and on the charred tunic of one was an Iron Cross. 
‘That’s Dous,’ said Oliver; ‘he’s met the fate 
he deserved.’ 
The French aeroplane had succeeded in landing 
safely, and the flight pilot came running up to Oliver 
and Vivian, whom he insisted on embracing. 
‘My brave comrades, my gallant friends,’ he said, 
‘you have rendered France a great service. You 
have avenged innocent lives. This Zeppelin has 
many times flown over Paris, doing a lot of damage. 
This morning a poor little girl had both her legs 
blown off, two women were killed, and a hospital 
was set on fire, burning several wounded soldiers. 
My comrades, you have rid the world of a lot of 
monsters.’ 
‘You jolly nearly rid the world of us,’ said 
Vivian bluntly: 
The Frenchman opened his eyes very wide. 
«But how, monsieur ?’ 
‘By firing at us.’ ‘ 
«Ah, true. A small mistake of Claude’s, but he 
was so reckless. Poor Claude! he is dead. When 
we rammed the Zeppelin he was shot through the 
heart ;’ and, with the impulsiveness of the French, 
the airman wrung his hands, while tears stood in his 
eyes. 
‘Vivian,’ said Oliver, ‘let’s get on. I feel a bit 
queer.’ ! 
A dozen offers of cars were made, and Vivian 
accepting one, they were soon on their way to the 
British lines, the Frenchmen cheering as they started, 
 
-P-A-G-E-350
334 A DUEL IN THE AIR. 
‘Excitable beggars,’ said Vivian. 
‘Uncomfortably so,’ murmured Oliver, and sink- 
ing back on his seat, he tried his hardest to keep 
himself from swooning; but he never afterwards 
remembered how he got back to their own lines, 
and had only a hazy recollection of the hearty 
reception they got from their countrymen, who 
had witnessed the whole of the exciting duel in 
the air.

        CHAPTER XXXIX. 
VON LENZ DISPOSES OF HIS IRON CROSS, 
LIVER, although suffering from burns and severe 
shock, refused to go to hospital. Vivian saw 
him to his quarters and dressed his hurts, and 
while he did so Oliver related what the sergeant 
had told him about Von Lenz. 
‘Lie down quietly for an hour or two,’ said 
Vivian, ‘and I will ferret out the truth of the 
matter.’ 
Some hours later he returned, finding Oliver very 
much better. 
‘The old chap was right, Noll, he said; ‘Von 
Lenz is a prisoner. I have seen him, talked with 
him, and I have got permission to ask him to 
our mess to-night. I have told the fellows about 
him, and they are all quite anxious to meet a really 
decent German, if there are any, a matter about 
which a good many of them are very dubious.’ 
‘I don’t wonder at it,’ said Oliver. 
That night seven or eight of them assembled in 
the quarters of Vivian’s captain, and Von Lenz, 
under escort of an officer, looking pale, with his 
right arm in bandages, came in, 
He at once went up to Oliver, whom he shook 
warmly by the hand. ‘Please excuse my left hand,’ 
he said, ‘but one of your men has for a time put 
my right arm “out of action,” as you say.’ 
‘T hope it will soon be well again,’ said Oliver ; 
and Von Lenz turned to the other officers present,
-P-A-G-E-352
  336 VON LENZ DISPOSES OF HIS IRON CROSS. 
and bowing, said, ‘Gentlemen, you have conferred 
a great honour upon me by asking me to dine with 
you. I appreciate the opportunity of meeting in 
social intercourse honourable gentlemen whom it has 
been my privilege to meet in the field.’ 
‘The pleasure is ours, Herr Deutscher,’ said a 
young subaltern flippantly. ‘To tell the truth, we 
were beginning to think your chaps were a crowd 
of rotters, and it’s come as something of a surprise 
‘to us to hear from Drummond that there are at 
least some good fellows amongst the Kaiser's officers.’ 
‘I am afraid, sir, your reproof is only too just,’ 
said Von Lenz sadly; and the subaltern, ignoring 
the frowns and nods of some of his superiors, would 
have continued to give Von Lenz his opinion of 
German officers, had not Vivian requested him, 
gently but firmly, to ‘keep off the grass.’ 
The dinner went off very successfully, the officers 
present being pleased with Von Lenz’s modesty and 
the sensible way in which he talked upon the various 
subjects under discussion. 
The young subaltern was one of the first to say 
in a very loud whisper to Vivian that, ‘for a German, 
Von Lenz was quite a decent chap.’ 
The dinner was over, when Von Lenz, taking his 
handkerchief from his pocket with his left hand, 
dropped something with a metallic tinkle on the 
ground. An officer stooped politely to pick the 
article up, and handed to Von Lenz an Iron Cross. 
‘Yours, I think,’ he said dryly. 
Von Lenz, blushing fiery-red, replied, ‘It is mine, 
and to earn it was once the ambition of my heart. 
My views have somewhat altered since then, and the 
coveted decoration has been so indiscriminately given, 
 
-P-A-G-E-353
VON LENZ DISPOSES OF HIS IRON CROSS. 387 
and for such questionable acts, that few German 
gentlemen care about wearing it. When I was 
taken prisoner I removed it, and I shall never wear 
it again. In fact, for me soldiering is over. There 
was no more enthusiastic officer than I in the army 
when war broke out, but the fashion in which this 
war has been waged has killed my military aspira- 
tions. If you opened the door this: minute and 
offered me my liberty, I would not take it, for I 
have no heart to draw sword again in this quarrel. 
I number among my friends, besides Mr Hastings— 
if, indeed, he allows me still to call myself his 
friend—many Englishmen, and the high opinion 
I always held of them has been enhanced tenfold 
since I have met them in the field. If you will 
allow me to say so, your private soldiers are the 
best trained and disciplined in the world, the most 
fearless in the charge, most resourceful in the hour 
of danger, and the most merciful in the moment of 
victory. Their officers are brilliant leaders and 
gallant gentlemen. Believe me, not only I but 
many scores of other officers learnt with heart-felt 
sorrow that Germany was going to fight against the 
country which of all others they had admired—the 
country to which we are allied by blood, by a 
common descent, and largely by religion. In this 
war Britain and Germany should have fought side 
by side; then, indeed, we should together have 
proved a formidable foe. The day may come—I 
think the day will come—when Britain and Germany 
will yet stand side by side against a common foe. 
Stranger things have happened. Your two Allies, 
France and Russia, are both nations that you have 
fought and conquered. If the day does come when 
EK. v 
   
-P-A-G-E-354
888 VON LENZ DISPOSES OF HIS IRON OROSS. 
Britain and Germany take the field as Allies, then 
Ludwig von Lenz will once more gird on his sword, 
and will do his best by some worthy deed to win 
anew a decoration which he now despises and 
discards.’ 
As he finished speaking he turned and flung into 
the fire which burned in the grate behind him the 
Tron Cross, which while he had been speaking he 
had held in his hand. 
The words of the young German Hussar caused his 
hearers, who, as soldiers, took little interest in polities, 
especially Continental politics, to ponder somewhat. 
Vivian, always ready to rise to the occasion, 
raised his glass and said simply, ‘Gentlemen, I give 
you the health of Captain von Lenz, a gallant 
soldier and a courteous foe;’ and every glass was 
emptied in response. 
Next day, Saturday, Von Lenz, with other pri- 
soners, departed ; and that night the British Army 
was shocked and filled with the deepest grief at 
news that staggered them for the moment. Lord 
Roberts, whom the majority of them had’ seen only 
a day or so before hale and hearty, was dead. A 
‘chill, contracted during his inspection of the troops, 
had suddenly developed into pleurisy and congestion, 
and twenty-four hours later the greatest soldier of 
the century passed peacefully away, surrounded, as 
he would have wished, by soldiers, and within sound 
of the enemy’s guns. 
Oliver and Vivian had, of course, to take their 
turn in the trenches; and one early morning, on 
being relieved, and reaching their billets, each found 
a communication awaiting him. Oliver tore his 
open, read it, and said, ‘ Well, I never !’
-P-A-G-E-355
VON LENZ DISPOSES OF HIS IRON OROSS. 339 
It was a communication from headquarters, an- 
nouncing that on the following day there was to 
be an inspection of British and Belgian troops by 
King Albert and Sir John French. The opportunity 
was to be taken to confer some British orders on 
Belgian officers, and some Belgian orders and the 
medal for deeds of self-devotion were to be con- 
ferred on certain British officers. 
‘It has pleased His Majesty the King of the 
Belgians,’ the letter ran on, ‘to award you the 
Belgian medal for conspicuous services rendered to 
the Belgian Army before and during the siege of 
Liége, and during the retreat on Antwerp. You 
will parade to-morrow with the troops to be 
inspected.’ 
Oliver at once went to Vivian, and found that 
he had received a similar communication. 
‘King Albert does not forget,’ said Vivian, ‘and 
this sort of thing will have a good effect on our 
chaps generally.’ 
It was an inspiring sight in the little market- 
place on the following day, when the troops 
marched past, not clad in showy uniforms, with 
fluttering flags and glittering arms, but hardened, 
war-worn veterans, whose stained clothing and 
battered equipment spoke eloquently of war's 
realities. 
After the march past the officers and men to be 
decorated took post in the centre of the parade. 
There stood King Albert with his staff, General 
French, and some French staff officers. 
The king shook hands cordially with all the 
British present. He then said, ‘Your gallant army 
has covered itself with glory, and I have every 
 
-P-A-G-E-356
  340 VON LENZ DISPOSES OF HIS IRON CROSS. 
confidence that we shall eventually drive the brutal 
Germans from our poor country. But in order to 
do so we must work shoulder to shoulder, and not 
relax our efforts for a moment until the enemy is 
completely crushed.’ 
The medals were then pinned on the breast of 
each recipient by the king himself amid the cheer- 
ing of the soldiers and of a number of civilians 
who witnessed the ceremony. Those who had been 
decorated were requested to stay to a banquet which 
had been prepared, and Oliver and Vivian retired 
among the crowd, when an officer approached them and 
said that Sir John French desired to speak to them. 
Wondering what could be the matter, they followed 
the officer to their chief, whom they found talking 
with the French officers present. 
Saluting the Commander-in-Chief, Oliver and 
Vivian waited for him to speak. 
‘General Legrand has something to say to you,’ 
he said; and a gray-bearded, distinguished-looking 
man advanced and gave Oliver and Vivian a salute, 
which was most punctiliously returned. 
General Legrand, speaking English with a strong 
French accent, said, ‘Gentlemen, I have ze honneur 
to convey to you ze compliments of my illustrious 
chief, General Joffre, on your gallant conduct in 
coming to ze assistance of one of our aeroplanes, and 
in helping to destroy ze German Zeppelin. My 
Commander-in-Chief also says you were ze officers 
who brought important news of General von Kluck’s 
march to ze left—how do you say ?—flank march, 
and so he ordaires me to present you each ze Cross 
of ze Legion of Honneur, and in hees name I pin 
it on your breast, so.’
-P-A-G-E-357
  VON LENZ DISPOSES OF HIS IRON OROSS. 341 
General Legrand then pinned the crosses on their 
tunics, and complimented the young soldiers on 
receiving France’s highest distinction. Sir John 
French added his congratulations; and Oliver and 
Vivian, quite astonished at the unexpected honour, 
rejoined the other officers, who cheered them most 
heartily. 
After the banquet, which was a very informal 
affair, they returned to their quarters, and in two 
days’ time were once more up to their knees in mud 
in the trenches.
-P-A-G-E-358
  CHAPTER XL 
A CHRISTMAS DAY ADVENTURE. 
HILE Oliver and Vivian were bearing their 
share in the war, important events were 
happening in other parts of the world. 
Two British cruisers, being met by a superior 
German force, were sunk in the Pacific. Turkey 
entered into the war against the Allies. As a set- 
off against these events, the German cruiser Emden 
was sunk, and Tsingtau was taken by the Japanese 
and British. The Russians also administered severe 
defeats on Germany and Austria. 
Then came the great surprise for the British 
troops in the field. The King himself came ‘over 
from London, and visited headquarters, the hospitals, 
and his gallant troops in the trenches. The enthu- 
siasm was unbounded, and a sergeant unbosomed 
himself to Oliver by saying he ‘reckoned His 
Majesty was a real sport.’ 
Then the four German cruisers which had sunk 
the Monmouth and the Good Hope were sent to the 
bottom ; in revenge for which the Germans, to their 
everlasting shame, made a raid on the British east 
coast, bombarded unfortified towns, and killed over 
a hundred women and children. 
Every fact that brought out more clearly the 
brutality of German methods of warfare, each proof 
of their policy of frightfulness, only hardened the 
determination of the fighting-men never to rest 
until the Teuton was crushed, and strengthened the
-P-A-G-E-359
  A CHRISTMAS DAY ADVENTURE. 843 
resolve of the men and women of Great Britain to 
back up the fighting-men to the uttermost. And 
so weeks of constant fighting, of attacks and counter- 
attacks, of entrenching and sapping and mining, 
all carried on in the rigour of a hard winter, passed 
by. The trenches were small canals of liquid mud, 
occasionally varied by being frozen hard. Snow, 
and slush, and freezing winds were the almost daily 
portion of the troops; but they endured it all with 
the unfailing good humour of the British soldier, 
and always kept the enemy fully employed. 
It would be monotonous to relate in detail the 
doings of the weeks between the battle of Ypres 
and Christmas Day; possibly the full story will 
never be told, as many of those who could have 
related tales of glorious heroism are, alas! since 
dead. But it would form a narrative of dogged 
pluck, of glorious heroism, and of patient endurance 
which has no superior in the annals of the British 
Army. 
Christmas Day was very cold, but rather misty. 
Oliver and Vivian were on duty together in one of 
the advanced trenches, and with their rations the 
night before had been brought up pleasant surprises 
from home in the shape of a card for every officer 
and man from the King and Queen, inscribed: 
‘May God protect you, and bring you safe home !— 
Mary R., George R.I.;’ while from Princess Mary 
came a pipe, tobacco and cigarettes, and a small 
gilt casket with a portrait of the Princess. 
‘Well, this is jolly thoughtful,’ said Oliver as he 
opened his packet. 
‘It’s an honour, my boy,’ replied Vivian; ‘and 
when we shake off this mortal coil, these relies will 
 
-P-A-G-E-360
  844 A CHRISTMAS DAY ADVENTURE. 
be handed down, or up, as the case may be, together 
with our medals, to our relatives. And now you'll 
have to smoke a pipe, since a Princess has sent 
you one.’ 
‘Well, I won’t start to-day, as I don’t want to 
be ill on duty, in case the Boches take it into their 
heads to treat us to a Christmas-box in the shape 
of a massed attack.’ 
Later in the morning a soldier, grinning all over his 
face, put his head into the officers’ dug-out and said, 
‘You might come here a moment, sir; the Boches 
are shouting out something as we can’t understand.’ 
Very cautiously Oliver peeped through a rifle- 
loophole, and saw a white flag being waved from 
the German trenches not more than two hundred 
yards away. 
‘Won’t do,’ he said to Vivian; ‘we’ve had some 
of that before.’ 
Vivian looked through his glasses, and said 
presently, ‘The beggars have put up a board, and 
chalked on it are the words, “ A Merry Christmas !”’ 
Oliver looked, and saw this was so; while another 
soldier cried, ‘Blow me if the old Germans aren’t 
climbing out o’ their trenches farther along, and, 
with their ’ands up, coming over to ours!’ 
This proved to be true; and presently an officer 
got out of the trench opposite Oliver, and holding 
his hands above his head, advanced within shouting 
distance, and cried out, ‘Don’t shoot; it’s Christmas 
Day, and we propose a truce.’ 
‘Well, this is a funny affair, said Oliver. ‘Are 
the beggars in earnest, I wonder ?’ 
‘Seems like it,’ replied Vivian ; ‘see, all along the 
line the men are coming out on both sides,’
-P-A-G-E-361
  A CHRISTMAS DAY ADVENTURE. 345 
And such was the fact. Oliver and Vivian then 
left their trench and advanced over the no man’s 
ground, still dotted with German corpses, towards 
the German officer. 
The officer, little more than a boy, halted, saluted, 
and then said in passable English, ‘A merry Christ- 
mas, gentlemen! We propose a truce for twenty- 
four hours for the purpose of burying our dead and 
having a respite from the awful work of killing 
each other. We are of the same religion; Bball we 
not keep our Christmas festival ?’ 
‘I don’t trust them,’ muttered Vivian; ‘and, 
besides, we may get a fine rap over the knuckles 
from headquarters.’ 
But all along the line officers and men on both 
sides had left their trenches, and were exchanging 
greetings and cigarettes. 
Vivian shrugged his shoulders. ‘It’s no good 
our hanging back,’ he said. ‘Let’s join in; but let 
half-a-dozen men remain in the trench and keep 
their rifles ready. We haven’t forgotten our late 
friend Falkenberg.’ 
Several other officers joined the young German 
who had first approached their trenches, and Oliver 
and Vivian went towards them. There was an 
immense amount of heel-clicking and saluting, and 
finding Oliver and Vivian both spoke German, they 
entered into a friendly conversation while the men 
on both sides buried the dead. 
The German officers talked confidently of victories 
on the Russian frontier, said complimentary things 
about the gallantry of the British troops, and 
expressed a hope that the war would soon be 
over. 
 
-P-A-G-E-362
346 A CHRISTMAS DAY ADVENTURE. 
Oliver and Vivian made guarded replies, and 
passed on to their right, where a number of German 
and British officers were talking and laughing 
loudly. They approached the group of British 
officers, amongst whom was one in kilts, and an 
officer of Gurkhas. 
‘What regiment does the Highlander belong to ?’ 
asked Oliver of Vivian, ‘I never saw a kilt of that 
colour before.’ 
‘Why, he’s a Territorial, old chap. Have you 
never heard of the London Scottish ?’ 
“Of course I have; but I didn’t know they were 
out. Did you?’ 
‘I should rather say I did. Haven't you heard 
about the hot corner they got into? They had to 
advance to support some cavalry, and they went too 
far. They were cut off by artillery and machine- 
gun fire, and were eventually nearly surrounded ; 
but they held their position all night, and the 
reserve company behind made a fine bayonet charge 
and rescued their comrades.’ 
They joined the group, and found the cause of 
merriment was that none of the British spoke 
German, nor the Germans English; and that they 
were exchanging views in bad French, one fat 
German major laughing heartily at some Teutonic 
joke. Vivian and Oliver were welcomed warmly 
when it was found they spoke German, and it was 
discovered that the fat major was trying to tell the 
Scottish lieutenant that he must be very cold in 
such short trousers. 
' The Gurkha officer was the Scotsman’s brother, 
and they all chatted amiably for some time; and 
when, later on, they returned to their trenches,
-P-A-G-E-363
  A CHRISTMAS DAY ADVENTURE. 847 
they entertained one another with songs and carols, 
‘Tipperary’ and the ‘Watch on the Rhine’ being 
prime favourites. 
Night fell, and everything went off without any 
hitch. Oliver and Vivian were preparing to get 
some sleep, when a man put his head into their 
dug-out and said a Scottish officer wanted to speak 
to them. 
They at once came out, and found that their 
visitor was the young lieutenant of the London 
Scottish. His face was pale and he looked worried, 
and, without waiting to be asked, at once plunged 
into his business. 
‘I say,’ he cried, ‘I’m in an awful mess) You 
saw our chaps and the Germans getting very friendly 
this morning, and after you went away they got 
more friendly still, singing, and exchanging smokes, 
and, I am told, going as far as having a drink 
together. I cautioned all the men against going too 
near the German trenches, but to-night I find there 
are eight men missing, and I am told these were a 
party of youngsters, mere boys, who said that they 
would go into the German trenches just for a lark.’ 
‘Phew!’ whistled Oliver. ‘Why on earth were 
they allowed out of sight? You ought to have 
kept an eye on them.’ 
‘I know I ought, and thought I had done so. It’s 
only since dark that I’ve made the discovery. I 
went off to my brother in the Gurkhas and told 
him, and we’ve got a plan. I’m not going to 
leave the trenches without my lads, if they ’re alive, 
or without avenging them, if they’ve met with any 
—any accident.’ 
‘And what is your plan ?’
-P-A-G-E-364
348 A CHRISTMAS DAY ADVENTURE. 
‘Simply that my brother and I, with a dozen 
men, will steal across to the German trenches, and 
by some means find out whether our boys are 
there. If so, we’ll demand their instant release. 
If the Germans refuse—well, they ll have to fight 
for their prisoners ;’ and the lieutenant snapped his 
jaws firmly. 
‘H’m!’ said Vivian; ‘a risky business. I don’t 
know how it will be viewed at headquarters.’ 
‘Hang headquarters!’ said the Scotsman. ‘I 
don’t mind being cashiered, or shot, but I’m not 
going to let my fellows go down without an effort 
_ to save them, and I’ve just come to put you on your 
guard in case of a shindy. I thought, perhaps, if 
one of you would accompany us, as you’re the 
only ones I know who can speak their beastly 
language ’ 
‘Look here,’ said Vivian; ‘you’ve got into a 
hole, and we'll try to help you out. Only you 
must be guided by my friend and me, who have 
had some experience of German methods.’ 
‘Only too delighted, my dear chaps,’ cried the 
Territorial thankfully. 
‘Then one thing is, well take a dozen Gurkhas 
instead of your Scottish. They ’re used to this sort 
of work, and will move so silently that a dog 
wouldn’t hear them. Let’s get along and have a 
talk with your brother.’ 
The conference between the four officers lasted 
some time; then a dozen little Gurkhas were called 
round their officer, who explained to them what 
they were going to attempt. The round brown 
faces crumpled up in delighted smiles, and there 
was a gleam of white teeth as the men handled  
-P-A-G-E-365
A CHRISTMAS DAY ADVENTURE. 349 
their favourite weapon, the kukri. When they were 
told by their officer that they would have to take 
their rifles also, they seemed a little disappointed ; 
but Vivian had planned the whole thing, and 
success depended entirely upon implicit obedience. 
All being ready, the signal was given, and the 
four officers and twelve Gurkhas climbed noiselessly 
out of the trench. The night was very cold and 
rather dark; moreover, the Germans were keeping 
very little lookout, as the sounds of singing from 
the trenches plainly proved. Caps and greatcoats 
had been discarded by the little party, and all 
bright appointments or anything likely to make a 
metallic sound had been removed. Silently, then, 
the sixteen men crawled very slowly towards the 
German trénches. 
At an agreed signal from Vivian the others 
halted, and he and Oliver crept right up to within 
hearing distance. They listened intently, and could 
hear all that took place. Nothing however, tran- 
spired that gave them any clue to the fate of the 
missing Scots, and separating, they made their way 
right and left, always trying to overhear something 
that would guide them in their search. 
Although the weather was piercingly cold, they 
did not feel it, the apprehension of being discovered 
keeping them warm. 
Presently Vivian heard an unmistakably British 
voice exclaim in good English, ‘Look here, you 
bally rascals! give us something to drink; we’re 
parched.’ 
Another voice went on: ‘The beggars don’t 
understand us, of course, but they might at least 
guess we are thirsty.’
-P-A-G-E-366
ee mee 
: 350 A CHRISTMAS DAY ADVENTURE. 
Then a German said, ‘I wonder what they are 
saying, Fritz.’ 
‘Grumbling about being captured, or perhaps 
saying they are cold. Their legs must be freezing 
this bitter night.’ ‘ 
‘Perhaps they are hungry,’ said another German. 
‘I should like to give them something to eat, but 
you know what the captain is. “Give them 
nothing,” he said, and I don’t want a dose of the 
whip in the morning.’ 
Vivian had heard enough. Silently he rejoined 
his companions, and the rest of the plan was put 
into execution. 
About ten minutes later the Germans in the 
trench were startled at hearing a voice saying, 
‘Don’t one of you move to touch a weapon or to 
put out the fire in that brazier. You are all covered 
by British rifles, and the first man who disobeys 
will give the signal for the death of every one of 
you.’ 
‘Du Vlieber Gott!’ cried a terrified German 
soldier ; ‘what is that ?’ and he looked up in alarm 
to see Vivian’s pale face, and the barrel of an 
automatic pistol pointed at him. A dozen other 
black tubes were pointing over the edge of the 
trench, and it was clear to the Germans that they 
were trapped. 
‘What shall we do?’ asked another voice. 
The answer was supplied by Vivian. ‘You 
have some British prisoners here,’ he said. 
‘They came into our trenches, and our captain 
ordered that they should be detaixud’ 
‘Release them at once.’ 
‘We dare not.’ 
 
-P-A-G-E-367
  A CHRISTMAS DAY ADVENTURE. 351 
‘T shall count five, and if by that time you have not 
obeyed I will give the order to fire. One—two’. 
‘Wait, Herr Englinder ; we will obey.’ 
A few seconds later eight joyful Britons clambered 
over the edge of the trench, and would have cheered, 
but their lieutenant ordered them sternly not to make 
a sound, but to creep silently back to their own 
trenches. 
‘Now all of you come out of that trench and 
surrender,’ said Vivian. 
‘But’ began a man. 
Vivian again began counting, but before he had 
reached ‘four’ the foremost German had climbed out 
of the trench, almost falling back again when he saw 
the dark faces of the Gurkhas, their most dreaded foes. 
Eighteen Germans followed, and when the trench 
was empty the Germans were commanded in a fierce 
whisper to crawl towards the British trenches, the 
British and Indians following them silently. 
In ten minutes all were in safety, and the eight 
told their tale. They had foolishly entered the 
German trench, and all had gone well, the soldiers 
being quite friendly, until an officer suddenly 
appeared, and a very angry altercation had arisen 
between him and the German corporal. The end 
was that the British, despite their remonstrances, 
were secured, and the captain marched the German 
corporal off under arrest. 
‘That will teach you,’ said Vivian, ‘not to trust 
Germans again.’ 
The Scottish lieutenant was profuse in his thanks 
to Oliver and Viv in. 
‘And what are you going to do with the German 
prisoners ?’ asked Oliver.   
 
-P-A-G-E-368
EE ye ee ee Tem oe fen me NT 
352 A CHRISTMAS DAY ADVENTURE. 
‘My men are clamouring to cut their throats,’ 
grinned the Gurkha lieutenant. 
‘Well, you had better get your chaps out of the 
way, then,’ replied his brother. 
‘The best way will be to give them a fright, keep 
them for an hour or so, and then release them,’ said 
Vivian ; and this was agreed upon. 
On New Year's Eve Oliver and Vivian received 
an invitation from the young Scotsman to spend 
the evening with him and a few others of his 
regiment ‘for the sake of auld lang syne,’ and a very 
merry evening they had. 
‘By the way,’ asked Oliver during the evening, 
‘what did you do with your German prisoners ?’ 
‘It was the funniest thing you ever heard of,’ 
replied the lieutenant, laughing. ‘In about an hour 
I told them in good broad Scotch to clear out; but 
of course they could not understand a word. Then 
I clearly showed them by signs what I meant, and 
they, also by signs, intimated that if they got out- 
side the trench we should shoot them. So at last 
I told our chaps to bundle the beggars out; but 
they threw themselves on the bottom of the trench, 
and squealed and kicked up such a bobbery that we 
had to give it up, for fear of raising an alarm; on 
which the beggars went off to sleep, and snored like 
so many pigs. Then we got another of our chaps 
in the morning who spoke a bit of German, and he 
told them they were free; whereupon they grinned, 
said they were quite sick of the war, and would we 
kindly keep them prisoners? So by this time I 
dare say they are in the Old Country, thanking 
their lucky stars that for them, at least, the war 
is over.’ , :    
-P-A-G-E-369
  CHAPTER XLL 
A BREAKDOWN. 
‘H® has a temperature of 101°, said the doctor 
as he looked at his clinical thermometer ; 
‘he can’t be moved now, or he’ll get pneumonia. 
The greatest care will have to be taken of him, and 
it will be many weeks before he’s fit for duty 
again.’ 
‘Thank goodness it’s no worse!’ said Vivian with 
deep feeling. ‘If he only pulls through, I don’t 
mind. He’s done enough.’ 
The scene was at a base hospital, and Oliver, 
flushed, with a burning skin and glassy eyes, lay 
in bed. The cold and exposure had been too much 
for him; and one night, on duty, he had completely 
collapsed, after having had a bad cold and cough 
for some days. Vivian had watched beside him all 
night, for Oliver had grown delirious, and next 
day had got him removed to the hospital, where 
he had now lain for two days. 
Running over to see him, Vivian had heard the 
doctor’s verdict, and had then been obliged to go, 
as he was that night for duty. 
For days Oliver lay in a very critical condition, 
and then one night he was carried to the great 
hospital train and sent to Bordeaux, where he was 
tended with all the kindness and loving care that 
our sick and wounded soldiers get. That he was 
young and passably good-looking was nothing in 
his disfavour, and he had half-a-dozen nurses who 
KK. w
-P-A-G-E-370
354 A BREAKDOWN. 
tended him day and night, and to whom nothing 
was too much trouble. When he got convalescent 
he could have gone to England, but he refused; and 
his mother came to Bordeaux to nurse him, and in 
the early spring he was again fit and well, and 
anxious once more to get back to his work. 
During Oliver’s illness Vivian constantly wrote 
to him, and once got leave to run down to Bordeaux 
to see him. 
Vivian was spending a good bit of time with the 
Flying Corps, and he kept Oliver well informed of 
what was going on in Flanders, while he learnt 
the rest of the news from the papers. 
The Turkish attempt to capture Egypt proved a 
fiasco. A blockade of Germany was declared, and 
her submarines endeavoured to frighten the world 
by their callous sinking of boats of any nationality. 
More than one, however, had paid the penalty by 
going to the bottom. Russia was pushing on, too, 
and Austria was being slowly but surely crushed. 
Early in March Oliver got permission from a 
medical board to rejoin his regiment, and he and 
his mother started for Paris. There they had to 
part, and Oliver looked forward with dread to the 
painful ordeal. They were to spend their last 
evening together in Paris, and Mrs Hastings was 
very pale as Oliver took her in to dinner at the 
Hotel de Lille. 
Suddenly a rich voice fell upon his ear. ‘Little 
Hastings, as I’m a sinner !—the young rascal who 
laughed at my French.’ 
Oliver turned, and, behold! there was Terence 
Dwyer, looking well, fat, and perfectly groomed. 
‘Well, this is a pleasant surprise. I’ve never
-P-A-G-E-371
A BREAKDOWN. 355 
heard a word of you since I saw you lying as one 
dead on a gun-limber.’ 
‘And I never heard till yesterday of the big 
share you had in saving the guns of my battery. 
But we can talk all this shop another time; you 
haven’t introduced me to your lady friend yet.’ 
‘Captain Dwyer, my mother.’ 
‘By the powers, ig it so? Indade, madam, I 
took you for the young rogue’s elder sister. And 
whin you introduce me to your next friend, Hastings, 
just call me major, will you ?’ 
“Of course; how silly of me not to notice the 
crown! And that order, too; what is it?’ 
‘Just the D.S.O., and prisinted by his blessed 
Majesty himself, God bless him! I saw all about 
your honours in the papers; and if any one deserved 
them, it’s yourself and Vivian Drummond.’ 
Major Dwyer was on his way from England to 
rejoin his battery, and being in the highest of spirits, 
was a godsend to Oliver in cheering up his mother. 
Mrs Hastings made an effort to be cheerful, but it 
was not always successful. 
‘I tremble when I think of Oliver going back 
again,’ she said in confidence to Major Dwyer. 
‘This awful war is so different from our previous 
ones ; it seems as if every one is being killed.’ 
‘Bless you, Mrs Hastings!’ said the cheery 
Dwyer, ‘Oliver will be all right. After Liége and 
Mons, the fighting before us will be easy. Germany ’s 
getting weaker, and we ’re getting stronger. We’ve 
got a much easier job before us than we had.’ 
And Mrs Hastings felt cheered, though she wasn’t 
quite convinced, for Major Dwyer was so breezily 
optimistic about everything.  
-P-A-G-E-372
  356 A BREAKDOWN. 
At last the wrench was over; Mrs Hastings was 
on her way to Havre, and Oliver to headquarters, 
which he and Major Dwyer reached that night. 
Vivian met them at the railhead, and a jolly evening 
they spent together. 
‘You ’re just in time,’ said Vivian mysteriously ; 
‘the big push is about to commence.’ 
‘When—where ?’ asked his listeners. 
‘I may not tell you all I know, but this is certain. 
In a couple of days we are going to make an 
attempt to break the German line, to test their 
strength and ours. On the measure of success that 
we obtain will depend our future conduct of the 
campaign. Every effort will be made to give the 
enemy a smashing defeat, and every man will be 
expected to do his utmost.’ 
‘Then Hastings and I are the men you want, 
mended, rested, and eager for the fray; eh, young- 
ster ?’ said Major Dwyer. 
‘Yes, I’m ready,’ agreed Oliver. 
‘We must get posted to our units without delay, - 
or we shall be out of it.’ 
‘Don’t trouble; every man is wanted, and every 
man will get his chance,’ said Vivian.
-P-A-G-E-373
  
CHAPTER XLII 
THE BREAKING OF THE GERMAN LINE. 
T was an hour before dawn, two days later. All 
night long, in the village of Laventie, numbers 
of selected officers, among whom were Oliver and 
Vivian, had been assisting in guiding and giving 
directions to the thousands of troops who were 
advancing to the great attack. The moment for 
which the British troops had waited impatiently 
through all those weary months of trench fighting, 
of attacks and counter-attacks which had led to 
no result, had arrived. 
The men, eager and confident, were pressing on 
to their appointed places, and all the arrangements 
were working as smoothly as possible. 
Famous British regiments, Highlanders, Riflemen, 
linesmen with glorious records, filed past. With 
them were eager battalions of Territorials—Fusi- 
liers, Seaforths, Gordons, Rifles—all proud and well 
worthy to take their place beside their brothers of 
the regulars. 
There, too, were Canadians, magnificent specimens 
of manhood, Indians, Garhwalis, Baluchis, Sikhs, 
all marching steadily and silently to the posts 
assigned to them. : 
The essence of the whole thing was that the 
attack was to be a surprise, and every man was 
determined that no fault of his should prevent it 
from being so. 
At last the troops had passed, and Oliver and
-P-A-G-E-374
358 THE BREAKING OF THE GERMAN LINE. 
Vivian, with some other officers, went on with the 
old ‘Die Hards’ of Albuera fame, and the Camero- 
nians, descendants of the stern old Covenanters who 
had defied the second James. 
For an hour or two there had been comparative 
silence. This was broken suddenly by the deep 
‘boom’ of a British gun, which sent a sort of thrill 
through the waiting thousands. Another and another 
followed, and so on for more than an hour. 
‘It’s the artillery making sure of the range,’ 
said Vivian ; ‘all depends on their accuracy.’ 
While they were waiting hot coffee was served 
out, and the men cracked jokes as they asked one 
another to pass another lump of sugar. 
Dawn broke, and first the church spire at Neuve 
Chapelle became faintly visible, then the ground, 
rising towards a horse-shoe ridge behind. ‘To the 
right front was the Bois du Biez, and to the right 
of that again, at the junction of the roads, the 
strongly fortified German position which the Tommies 
had christened Port Arthur, and which, as they shut 
their jaws firmly, they swore that Germany should 
not hold many hours longer. 
Presently British aeroplanes, like great soaring 
birds, hummed and buzzed away over the German 
positions, and from the packed British trenches many 
a pair of eyes followed their course. The officers 
looked impatiently at their watches, for at 7.30 the 
bombardment was to begin, a bombardment com- 
pared to which all that had occurred before would 
be child’s-play. Slowly, slowly the minutes crawled 
by, while the only sound heard was the joyous 
singing of the birds. Then, suddenly, boom! a 
great gun bellowed out its signal; in a second, with
-P-A-G-E-375
  THE BREAKING OF THE GERMAN LINE. 3859 
a terrific crash, hundreds of guns roared and shrieked. 
The noise was deafening, appalling; the air was 
full of murderous metal; shells screamed, field-guns 
at short range to smash the German barbed wire 
entanglements raged and crashed, their shrapnel 
passing only a few feet above the trenches. 
The violence of the fire was truly hellish; the 
very ground trembled under the shock. The German 
trenches were soon covered with a dense pall of 
smoke, the sickening fumes of the lyddite blowing 
back towards the British lines. 
Such was the violence and accuracy of the 
bombardment that earth and guns and sometimes 
fragments of bodies were seen being blown into the 
air by the splendidly placed shells of the British 
gunners. 
‘Nothing can live in that,’ said Oliver to Vivian, 
as they watched from an advanced trench the effect 
of the fire. 
‘We hope nothing will, said Vivian calmly. 
‘We’ve got to make a big push to-day.’ 
For thirty-five minutes the bombardment lasted, 
the village of Neuve Chapelle itself being seen, 
through the clouds of smoke and pillars of flying 
earth, to be crumbling and tottering to the ground. 
Then the whistles of the platoon commanders sounded ; 
the moment had arrived ! 
Eagerly the men scrambled from the firtaiebrins 
the officers, armed also with rifle and bayonet, 
formed them quickly; the artillery ‘lifted’ their 
range a hundred yards farther ahead, and the word 
to assault was given. 
‘We can’t be out of this, Noll, said Vivian, and 
they both scrambled out of the trench with the 
 
-P-A-G-E-376
  360 THE BREAKING OF THE GERMAN LINE. 
men. ‘The subalterns, as platoon leaders, were well 
to the front, but their men wanted no encouraging 
to advance. With bayonets well down, Lincolns 
and Berkshires dashed forward. 
They crossed the intervening space between the 
trenches with but few losses, and reached the first 
German trench. There the enemy left alive seemed 
half-demented, and shouting for quarter, held their 
arms above their heads. 
‘On to the next trench, lads,’ shouted Oliver; 
‘leave these fellows to be dealt with by those 
following ;’ and with one cheer they raced on. 
The enemy in the second trench got a machine- 
gun to bear, but its death-dealing rap-rap-rap was 
silenced before it had time to do much damage, the 
two officers who were working it falling, pierced 
with a dozen bayonets, and the soldiers in the 
trench meeting with the same fate. 
The trenches being carried, there was a moment 
to look round, and it was seen that the Indians 
had taken the trenches on the right with a rush, 
and were doubling away towards the village and 
the Biez Wood. The Rifle Brigade, out of breath 
after their tough fight, joined the Lincolns and Berk- 
shires, and all impatiently awaited the signal to 
attack the village of Neuve Chapelle itself, which 
the British artillery were furiously shelling. 
It was only with the greatest difficulty that the 
men could be restrained, and presently the signal 
was given, and away they went with a rush. It 
was into a scene of utter desolation that the troops 
raced. The church was a mass of ruins; only the 
great crucifix remained, by some miraculous accident, 
untouched ; the houses were simply heaps of ruins,
-P-A-G-E-377
THE BREAKING OF THE GERMAN LINE. 361 
but what remained of the streets were crowded with 
the enemy. 
‘Now we’ve got ’em,’ cried a sergeant, mad with 
the joy of seeing the enemy in the open and within 
bayonet-reach, after months of weary trench-work. 
There was no regular advance ; every man picked 
out an enemy and went for him. Bayonets were 
soon dulled and often bent, for the British were full 
of a righteous fury. The enemy, taken by surprise, 
were bewildered, and fought half-heartedly, and they 
fell in heaps. Half-dazed men crawled up from 
cellars and dug-outs, many shouting for mercy. 
‘Instant surrender, or death!’ was the ery. 
From the houses others fired at point-blank range 
on the British, who fought their way from house to 
house, being joined by the Gurkhas, radiant at fight- 
ing side by side with their old comrades of the 
Rifle Brigade. Kukri and bayonet did the work, 
and in an hour from the first attack Neuve Chapelle 
was in British hands. : 
The fight was, however, only really beginning. 
While Oliver and Vivian were waiting with the rest 
to continue the advance, a wounded. and _blood- 
stained corporal of the Middlesex Regiment, hatless 
and with no weapons, came staggering across towards 
them from the direction of ‘Port Arthur.’ 
‘For God’s sake send our chaps help!’ he gasped. 
‘They ’re hung up by the wire, and are being 
mowed down like grass.’ 
Then he fell senseless, and at the call from the 
major of the Leicesters, a hundred men, among 
them Oliver and Vivian, volunteered to go to the 
rescue. ¢ 
Round the brewery they doubled, out into a very

inferno of shot and shell, and away towards the 
German trenches at ‘Port Arthur.’ At once the 
position was clear. There were what was left of the 
Garhwalis—all the officers and 350 men being killed 
or wounded — hacking and bashing at the wire 
entanglements, which the British artillery had failed 
to smash. With them were 150 men and one 
officer, all that were left of the Cameronians, and 
a handful of the Middlesex, the old ‘Die Hards.’ 
Four times had they charged up to the accursed 
wire entanglements, only to be driven back by the 
sheets of lead from machine-guns. Again had they 
charged, and every man was determined to die 
rather than retreat. Hacking with bayonets, smash- 
ing with rifle-butts, they fought madly to break 
through, while all the time the machine-guns reaped 
their bloody harvest. 
It was the kind of fighting the Germans like, 
and they were confidently expecting to slay every 
Briton. But that rescuing hundred came tearing 
across the field strewn with dead, and with an 
angry roar rushed on the flank of the trenches. 
They dropped men as they plunged along, but they 
could not be stayed. They reached the trenches, 
and then a grim and bloody conflict took place. 
Oliver and Vivian had both armed themselves with 
rifle and bayonet, and side by side they fought. 
Down @ communication trench they forced their 
way, every man behind them a hero; then into 
the main trench, shooting, stabbing, clubbing all 
they met. The machine-guns were silenced, the 
enemy annihilated, and the fury of the fire stopped. 
Scotsman, Londoner, and Indian beat down the 
barbed wire, and with a triumphant rush what was

left of them joined their rescuers. The price paid 
had been fearful, 500 men left out of 2000; but 
the trenches were won! \ 
Other regiments, the Devons and the Yorks, 
joined them, and together they swept on in face of 
a murderous fire from the German artillery. But 
their blood was up, and they dashed into the Biez 
Wood, where a furious struggle began. 
The front row of trenches was carried, and down 
the traverses rushed the victors, the bombers push- 
ing on and pelting the Germans out into the open, 
where rifle-fire mowed them down. Hour after 
hour the fight went on; fresh regiments poured 
up; Worcesters, Lancashires, Borderers all joined in, 
and by half-past one Neuve Chapelle and all its 
environs were in British hands. 
But the British attack had been held up in 
several places, and it was late in the afternoon 
before an advance in force towards the Pittre road 
could be attempted ; and then the Germans were so 
strongly posted that but little progress could be 
made, and the troops were ordered to bivouac, but 
to hold with their lives what they had won. 
‘What a day!’ cried Oliver that night to Vivian. 
‘It seems like an experience of purgatory.’ 
“And there must be many more such, Noll, before 
the Allies camp in the Unter den Linden. It’s 
been a glorious day for Britain, for it’s shown that 
in spite of a dragging winter campaign, our brave 
lads have kept their ascendancy over the Germans, 
and can break their line whenever they are prepared 
to pay the price.’ : 
‘They ll move heaven and earth to get back 
what they ’ve lost,’ said Oliver. ‘They'll rush up 
2

364 THE BREAKING OF THE GERMAN LINE. 
reinforcements by the thousand, and hurl them at 
us like madmen.’ 
‘Let ’em,’ replied Vivian. ‘What we’ve got 
we'll hold.’ 
And so they did. Before dawn next morning 
the Germans opened a, terrific fire from every gun 
' that could be brought to bear on Neuve Chapelle. 
As soon as it was daylight, surging masses of gray- 
coated soldiers were seen advancing. They were 
led by a mounted officer, and a non-commissioned 
officer was seen scourging the foremost files on with 
a whip, like cattle. 
During the night the British had worked inces- 
santly, and twenty-one machine-guns were ready to 
receive the attack. 
A whistle sounded, and the whole line burst into 
fire. The machine-guns literally poured out death ; 
the gray coats went down in ranks, in companies, 
in regiments. There was no need for the British 
to charge; not one man ever got within two 
hundred yards of their line. The German General 
Staff had underrated the British strength, and 
their men were simply blown to pieces. The 
carnage was sickening, and it was the Germans’ 
own heaps of dead and wounded that stopped their 
farther advance. 
Then the British delivered their counter-attack. 
The artillery pelted the enemy with shrapnel and 
high-explosive shell until some one gave the signal 
to advance. Again the British pushed on. 
‘The Germans are on the run,’ was the cry, and 
away towards the enemy’s trenches they raced. 
These they carried, but the artillery fire behind 
them still continued.
-P-A-G-E-381
  THE BREAKING OF THE GERMAN LINE. 865 
‘Something wrong,’ said Vivian to Oliver; ‘our 
own guns are firing on us.’ 
Flags were waved, but the pitiless fire of shrapnel 
still continued. : 
‘Good God,’ cried a major, ‘we shall be anni- 
hilated! What’s the matter ?’ 
Then the truth was discovered. Their attack had 
been premature, the telephone communication with 
the artillery had been destroyed, and word could not 
be sent. A dozen men volunteered to go back and 
inform the artillery. One after the other they 
started ; one by one they fell as they attempted to 
cross the shot-riddled area, 
‘T’ll go,’ shouted Vivian, and away he started. 
With bated breath Oliver watched him. Vivian 
ran on, stumbled, got up, went forward again, and 
was almost out of danger; then, ah God! he flung 
up his arms and fell. Caring nothing, Oliver 
darted out, and reached his friend unscathed. 
Vivian’s head and chest were covered with blood, 
and he was limp and lifeless. 
‘Dead! dead!’ cried Oliver, in anguish; and 
through his brain the words throbbed: ‘Greater 
love hath no man than this, that a man lay down 
his life for his friends.’ 
Dazed with the horror of it, Oliver knelt with 
Vivian’s head in his lap, while the shells screamed 
and burst all round him. Then the firing ceased ; 
the artillery had discovered the position. 
The Germans, seeing what had happened, came 
sweeping on to the attack. But some Territorial 
battalions had seen the danger of their comrades of 
‘ the regulars, and Seaforths, Fusiliers, Gordons, and 
Riflemen swept forward in the face of a biting fire.
-P-A-G-E-382
ree 
866 THE BREAKING OF THE GERMAN LINE. 
By scores they fell, but they reached their comrades ; 
a titanic struggle took place, and the enemy, 
crushed and despairing, turned and ran, the British 
after them. 
Then those noble comrades of the fighting-man, 
those heroes who, without retaliating, face the worst 
horrors of war to rescue their wounded comrades, 
the R.A.M.C. men, came up, and Vivian was gently 
lifted on to a stretcher and borne away. 
Without a word, but with a dull and aching 
heart, Oliver watched them go. He longed wildly 
to accompany them and see the last of his beloved 
friend, but the British soldier ever puts duty before 
sentiment. His place was in the firing-line, and 
dully he turned and followed the advancing troops. 
The fine weather of the preceding day had * 
gone, and a thick mist covered the ground. It 
favoured the Germans, who, under its cover, brought 
up reinforcements and essayed yet another counter- 
attack. But the Grenadiers and the Scots Guards, 
with a number of Territorial battalions, beat off the 
assault, and then the Germans seemed to give up 
the attempt as hopeless. 
Gallantly the British pushed on their advantage, 
and with grenade, bayonet, and bomb drove the 
enemy back right up to the houses about the Moulin 
de Piétre. A final stand was made there, and a 
a major of the Guards cried out to his men to re-form. 
“One more charge, lads,’ he cried, ‘and the victory 
is ours for good; the last kick will be knocked out 
of the enemy.’ 
‘Lead us on,’ shouted the men, and Oliver sprang 
to the front. 
At the double they went forward, and waving his

sword—for he had abandoned the rifle he’ had 
fought with the previous day—Oliver cried, ‘ Follow 
me! They have killed my friend, the bravest man 
that ever lived. Ill avenge him or’ 
A bullet caught him full in the chest. He gave 
a moan as he fell face downward, and the men, 
as they charged forward over him, set their teeth 
firmer, determined that a dozen Huns should pay 
with their lives for his.

zi SAY, young Noll, what a delightful day !’ 
‘Glorious, Vivian; to breathe this lovely air 
is like drinking in new life.’ 
Two months had passed away since that terrible 
day when the British had broken the German line 
at Neuve Chapelle. It was a beautiful day in May, 
and Oliver and Vivian sat in invalid-chairs on the 
terrace of ‘Seaview’ at Bournemouth, looking out 
over the blue waters of the Channel. 
Vivian’s had been a narrow escape. Two 
shrapnel-bullets had struck him, one grazing his 
head, the other smashing his collar-bone. Oliver 
had been shot through the chest, but, thanks to the 
prompt and skilful treatment of the doctors, both 
had recovered and been sent to England. It was 
only a question of time before they would be fit 
once more to take their places with their men 
and finish the task of smashing for good the bar- 
baric tyranny of Germany, which had made itself 
further detested by the inhuman employment of 
poisonous gases, and the unspeakable ‘crime of 
murdering 1500 innocent men, women, and children 
by the sinking of the Lusitania. ; 
‘What time did you say your mother and Mar— 
Miss Hastings would be here ?’ asked Vivian. 
‘For the third time, my dear boy, about eleven.’ 
‘Yes, yes, of course;’ and Vivian looked at his 
wrist watch. ‘About half-an-hour.’ 
A footstep sounded behind them, and Private 
Hawkins, himself convalescent, intruded his grinning 
face.

‘Anythink I can do for you gents?’ he asked, 
saluting. 
‘No, thanks.’ 
He disappeared, and in a quarter of an hour 
reappeared. ‘The morning papers,’ he said, laying 
them down, a broader grin than ever on his face. 
He stood for a moment or two, and Vivian said 
irritably, ‘Go away, Hawkins. I’m talking to Mr 
Hastings.’ 
‘Yes, sir; yes, sir;’ and away he went. 
‘Did you say your people were going to drive 
or walk, Oliver ?’ asked Vivian. 
‘I didn’t say either.’ 
‘Ah, I wonder now which they ’ll do. Does your 
sister like walking, Oliver?’ and Vivian managed 
to talk for ten minutes about Miss Hastings’s likes 
and dislikes, when again Private Hawkins intruded 
his wooden face. 
“Ave you looked at the papers, gentlemen ?’ he 
asked, with the grin even broader than before on 
his face. 
Vivian seized a book that lay on the table before 
him, and said, ‘If you disturb us again, I’ll shy 
this at you.’ : 
‘Orl right, sir; orl right,’ answered Hawkins ; 
‘on’y there’s some important news in the paper.’ 
‘War news ?’ asked Oliver. 
“Yes, sir, and no, sir.’ 
‘Well, what is it ?’ 
Private Hawkins very slowly and very deliberately 
unfolded the Zimes, and said, ‘There’s some V.C.’s 
and other things give to some orficers. I'll just 
read it.’ He droned out a list, to which neither 
Oliver nor Vivian paid much attention.

“You can cut out the rest,’ said Vivian presently, 
looking at his watch and seeing it was ten past 
eleven. 
‘There’s two other items might interest you,’ 
sniggered Hawkins. ‘There’s two appointments to 
this ’ere new order of the Military Cross;’ and he 
read out: ‘“ Lieutenant Vivian Drummond, Cold- 
stream Guards. For conspicuous gallantry in at- 
tempting to convey important news to the artillery, 
while exposed to a dangerous fire, on 19th March ; 
in which attempt he was seriously wounded. 
Second Lieutenant Oliver Hastings, Surrey Yeo- 
manry, attached 12th Lancers, For extreme 
bravery on several occasions, especially on 19th 
March for gallantly leading the last attack on the 
Germans near the Moulin de Piétre, when he was 
dangerously wounded.”’ 
‘By Jove, Vivian, what a bit of luck!’ cried 
Oliver excitedly. ‘The mater will be pleased.’ 
‘Give me the paper, Hawkins—no, never mind. 
Here, take this and make yourself scarce;’ and 
Vivian threw the young private half-a-crown, and 
scrambled out of his chair as two ladies from the 
room behind advanced towards the wounded officers. 
‘Congratulations, Oliver dear,’ cried his mother, 
as she kissed her son fondly. 
«And mine, Oliver,’ echoed his sister, as she 
affectionately attacked his other cheek. 
‘I say, Vivian’s looking,’ cried the blushing Oliver. 
‘Congratulations to you also,’ said both ladies. 
‘I’m sure you deserve the honour His Majesty has 
bestowed upon you.’ 
‘Do you really think so, Miss Hastings?’ 
whispered Vivian.

‘Yes. Why not? I suppose if you hadn't de- 
served it the King would not have given you the 
Cross.’ 
‘I wonder whether you ’re pleased.’ 
‘What can that matter, Mr Drummond ?’ said 
Miss Hastings innocently. 
‘It matters more to me than you may think, and 
if I live to see the end of this war I’ll tell you 
why.’ 
‘What a beautiful day,’ said Mrs Hastings; ‘and 
how you two poor dears have improved in looks 
these last few days! Make haste and get able to 
stand the journey, for I’m going to take you home 
to Holly Lodge, and nurse you back to complete 
health.’ 
‘Are you going to be bothered with me, Mrs 
Hastings ?’ asked Vivian. 
‘Why, of course; it would be cruelty to separate 
you two bosom friends; wouldn’t it ?’ 
‘Absolutely, Mrs Hastings; and so far as I’m 
concerned, I’m fit to stand the journey now.—Are 
you, Oliver ?’ 
‘A dozen such. To be really at home will do 
more towards putting me on my feet again than 
all the sea-breezes in the world.’ 
‘That being so, what do you say to our starting 
to-morrow ?’ asked his mother. 
‘Certainly.—How about you, Vivian ?’ 
‘The sooner the better, say I, Mrs Hastings,’ 
replied Vivian, ‘for I never felt so happy in all my 
life as during the two delightful days Oliver and 
I spent with you last summer.’

NOTES. 
Nore A—SERVICE IN THE GeRMAN ARMY. 
Every male German of sound physique is strictly liable to 
service in the army or navy. 
The army system is somewhat complex. Liability to military 
duty begins at seventeen and ceases at forty-five. At twenty 
the conscript is called up and subjected to a strict medical 
inspection. He may be passed at once into the army, or, if the 
supply of men is in excess of the demand, he may be put back 
for a year, or even two. If physically unfit he may be definitely 
rejected, or passed into the Ersatz Reserve, to come up if called 
upon, ’ 
the infantry serve two years, cavalry and artillery three, and 
the training is of the most rigorous character. 
After his colour service the soldier passes for five and a half 
years into the Active Reserve, being called up for periodical 
trainings. He next passes for five years to the First Ban of the 
Landwehr, during which time he is liable to be called out for 
training of a week or fortnight ; and for the next six he is in 
the Second Ban. At thirty-nine he passes to the Second Ban of 
the Landsturm until he is forty-five. 
The cavalry and artillery serve slightly varying terms in the 
different grades, but their total service is the same. 
The First Ban of the Landsturm consists roughly of men who 
are liable and fit for service, but who, owing to excess of recruits, 
have not been embodied by the age of twenty-three; of men 
who have been allowed to postpone their military service ; of 
men suffering from slight physical defects, but otherwise fairly 
fit for service; and of all boys over seventeen who have not 
begun their military service. 
Another important class of the army is the Einjiéhrige, or one 
year volunteers. These are principally the sons of well-to-do 
parents, who have had a Gymnasium education, and who have 
passed the university examination. They can choose their own
-P-A-G-E-389
NOTES, 873 
year of service, up to the age of twenty-six, and can select the 
arm or regiment they wish to serve in. They form the principal 
source for the supply of officers and non-coms. to the Reserve. 
The non-commissioned officers are mostly men who have 
volunteered at the age of seventeen, or who have re-engaged at 
the end of their two or three years’ service. They are, as a rule, 
great bullies. A minority of the non-coms. come from special 
preparatory schools. 
The officers are drawn either from cadets, who, after a special 
training in cadet schools, join the ranks as non-coms. for six 
months, and then pass to a war school, whence they obtain their 
commissions at nineteen years of age; or from youths who, at 
the end of their ordinary school education, join the ranks as 
Fahnenjunker (literally, flag-youths—ensigns), and serve till 
they are given a commission. All officers have to pass the 
genersi examination qualifying them for a commission, and their 
nomination has to be approved by a vote of officers of the 
regiment to which they have been nominated, the Guards regi- 
ments being very exclusive. 
At the outbreak of the war the Active German Army con- 
sisted of twenty-five army corps, comprising 669 battalions, 
550 squadrons, and 633 batteries. To these must be added 
434 battalions and 300 batteries of Reserve, and 310 battalions 
and 300 squadrons of Landwehr. The rough total was: Active 
Army, Reserve, and Landwehr, 3,100,000; Ersatz Reserve, 
900,000 ; untrained men liable to serve, and trained men of over 
thirty-six, 3,000,000 ; total, 7,000,000. 
Nore B—Tue ZaBern AFFarr. 
The events which took place at Zabern in December 1913 and 
January 1914 not only made the German Army look ridiculous 
in the eyes of the rest of Europe, but, viewed in the light of 
events which happened in Belgium and in France during the 
early stages of the present war, exposed the brutality and the 
utter lack of honour or moral perception that prevail amongst 
the officers of that army. 
The 99th Regiment of Prussian Infantry, quartered at Zabern 
in Alsace, had rendered itself particularly obnoxious to the in- 
habitants, possibly on account of the swaggering and intolerable 
bullying of its officers. A lieutenant, Baron von Forstner, seems 
to have been especially disliked—so much so that on several 
   
-P-A-G-E-390
    874 NOTES, 
occasions the townspeople shouted insulting epithets at him as 
he passed through the streets. 
On 2nd December 1913, while he was marching through Dett- 
weiler at the rear of a column of his regiment, certain of the 
populace made jeering remarks at him. He detailed a party of 
soldiers to arrest the townspeople who had dared so to insult a 
Prussian officer, but on the approach of the soldiers the people 
ran away. Ensign Weiss, however, pointed out a man who he 
said had cried out to Forstner, ‘You will be killed ;? whereupon 
Forstner immediately ordered Weiss and a file of men to arrest 
him. The fellow resisted, crying out that he had not opened his 
mouth ; but on Weiss insisting upon seizing him, it was asserted 
that he said, ‘Let me go or I will hit you on the jaw.’ All the 
while he continued to struggle ; but eventually it was stated that 
he was overcome by Weiss and several soldiers, and dragged 
before the Baron von Forstner, a dissipated young man of some 
twenty-three years of age. Being remonstrated with by Forstner, 
it was alleged that he made a movement as though to draw a 
knife—although it was admitted in evidence that several soldiers 
were holding him—whereupon the gallant Forstner drew his 
sword and deliberately cut him over the head, giving him a 
severe scalp wound. 
The actual fact was that the man so arrested, who had offered, 
according to the German version, such a tremendous resistance 
to some half-dozen burly soldiers, was a lame cobbler of poor 
physique, named Blank, who could not possibly have offered any 
serious opposition to even one soldier. 
The arrest of the cobbler gave rise to great indignation in 
Zabern, and minor riots followed. Colonel von Reuter, in com- 
mand of the 99th Regiment, had the town patrolled, machine- 
guns were kept ready loaded at the barracks, and this trivial incident 
was magnified into a grave revolt. 
The Mayor, seeing the childish view taken of the affair by the 
military, refused to make the wholesale arrests which Colonel von 
Reuter ordered him to do ; on which the colonel took the matter 
into his own hands, had the townspeople arrested right and left 
by armed soldiers, and kept a number of the citizens he had 
seized in his coal-cellars all night ! 
In arresting the people much unnecessary violence was used, 
and Lieutenant Schad knocked out a man’s tooth ; on which the 
Mayor of Zabern made such a report that an inquiry was ordered

to be made. Forstner had already been confined to his room for 
six days, when he was tried by court-martial and sentenced to 
forty-three days’ imprisonment. 
The regiment was moved from Zabern, and Colonel von 
Reuter and Lieutenant Schad were also tried by court-martial. 
With a great display of that military pomp and show beloved 
by the Germans, the trial lasted several days, and in the end 
both Von Reuter and Schad were ‘honourably acquitted,’ and 
the sentence on Von Forstner was reversed, it being stated ‘that 
he acted in self-defence.’ Although the man whose tooth had 
been knocked out by Schad appeared in court, the officer 
denied the act, and the noble court ‘were satisfied that had 
he committed the crime he would have acknowledged it.’ 
The defence offered for Forstner was even more ridiculous. 
It was admitted that ‘he struck the cobbler in self-defence, but 
that his sword was his ordinary military one, and had not been 
specially ground’ ! 
The Kaiser approved of the finding of the court; the Crown 
Prince, copying his august father’s example, sent a telegram 
congratulating these bandit officers on their acquittal ; and the 
whole German Army rejoiced in its victory. 
With the knowledge that the world now possesses of German 
military behaviour, such conduct would to-day cause but little 
surprise, but in January 1914 it came as something of a revela- 
tion. It may be an object-lesson of what this country might 
expect did it ever come under the jackboot of Prussian militarism. 
It has been stated in the press that both Von Forstner and 
Von Reuter have been captured in the present war.

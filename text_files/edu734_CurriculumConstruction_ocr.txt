PREFACE 
The school curriculum is the latest great social agency to feel 
the effect of the theory of evolution. Biology for sixty years has 
recognized the fact that living structure is modified to serve the 
functions of plants and animals. Sociology, economics, and history 
accept the fact that the forms of institutions are determined by 
the attempts of man to make his environment minister to his 
needs. Psychology has developed a functional and behavioristic 
point of view, and in philosophy pragmatism has achieved a 
permanent, place. 
While all these revolutionary changes have been under way, 
the theory of the formation of the curriculum has been slow to 
react to them. The curriculum builder has felt, like his pre- 
evolutionary prototype who clung to the theory of epigenesis, 
that the specialists who organize the subjects to meet the needs 
of their groups have developed the best possible curriculum. The 
force of evolutionary theory has been negatived by the strength 
of the doctrine of the transfer of training and by the prestige of 
the scientist. It has been held that the training of the faculties 
could be secured by already-existing forms of subject matter and 
that change in structure should therefore be resisted. To add to 
this conviction, the prestige of the scientist induced the lowly 
school teacher to believe that a structure built in conformity 
with his needs was equally suitable and satisfactory for the 
needs of the layman. 
Long before Darwin formulated his theories there was much 
intense, destructive criticism of the subject matter taught in the 
elementary schools. Particularly from the time of Rousseau 
educational theorists and an innumerable number of laymen and 
teachers have contended that the content of school subjects does 
not fulfill the functions of popular education. This criticism has

resulted in some modification by the elimination and addition 
of some subjects and parts of subjects, as is seen when we note 
the differences in the content of the school curriculum during the 
last fifty years. But these have been changes in iJetail; the 
cedar roof has been changed to slate, the veranda has been 
changed into a sleeping porch, a sun parlor has beer. added, a 
wing built on, and the outside painted: but the house still stands 
essentially as it came from the architect and the builder. 
In the last ten years, however, the criticism has begun to take 
constructive shape and a number of pioneer studies have been 
made from the functional point of view. Functions for subjects 
have been set up and the structures which will realize the functions 
have been derived. This has resulted in a considerable body of 
knowledge which can be collected and interpreted in terms of the 
functional theory of curriculum construction. To this task the 
present volume addresses itself. 
The author wishes to acknowledge his appreciation for the 
services rendered him by many educators, including Bonser, 
Bobbitt, Coursault, Dewey, Meriam, and Yocum. Particularly 
does he wish to express his appreciation of the assistance of his 
former colleague, B. H. Bode, whose criticism of the theoretical 
principles underlying the treatment has been a stimulus to clari- 
fying analysis, especially in the field of ideals and activities.

  THEORY 0° ‘JRRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 5 
§2—Arms, IpEats, AND ACTIVITIES 
Aims precede curriculum change. — Changes in the cur- 
riculum are always preceded by modifications in our conception 
of the aim of education. In the organized writings of educators, 
fundamental changes in the curriculum have been advocated 
only after the writers have brought forward a statement of aim 
differing from the current idea. Among these writers we find 
Plato describing the qualities of the perfect warrior guardian of 
the state, before determining what the training of such an indi- 
vidual should be. Similarly, Comenius presents the aims of 
virtue, piety, and learning before describing his well-known cur- 
riculum. Rousseau likewise justified his course of study by an 
appeal to certain assumptions concerning the development of the 
“nature” of the child. 
In the less formal and more fluid movements of vhought of 
any generation, including our ofvn, at the time when the curric- 
ulum is in the making, we find that only after such aims as social 
efficiency ‘have been discussed for a number of years in the edu- 
cational press and forum do changes in the curriculum beg n to 
appear. No wholesale change occurs, but bit by bit additions 
are proposed or eliminations advocated. Indeed it may be said 
that a change in the curriculum runs on the average ten years __ 
behind the advocating of a change in the aim of education. And 
for the curriculum change to become large enough to-be noticed, 
a much longer period of incubation is necessary. It is rather 
generally the case that most of the theoretical discussions among 
educators as to changing the statement of aim fail to modify 
the practical curriculum as it is taught in the schoolroom. But 
even though a change comes slowly and sometimes seems infini- 
tesimal, it is always preceded by a new statement of the aim 
of education. 
Uses of the aim. — This preliminary statement of aim is a 
prerequisite to both selection and use. The inheritance handed 
down through the schools to the young is so massive that it can 
never be completely assimilated. Selection is, therefore,neces- 
   
-P-A-G-E-14
CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
sary, and a basis of selection must be determined. This is obtained 
through the statement of aim. For instance, if piety is to be the 
aim of education, then it is necessary that the course of study 
should contain an adequate amount of religious material. If, 
on the other hand, social_efficiency is set up as the aim of edu- 
cation, it is obvious that the activities with which people are 
engaged in conjunction with other people should receive primary 
emphasis. If the earning of a living through a vocation be set 
up as the primary aim of education in any school, then it is 
natural that vocational technique should be included in the course 
of study. These illustrations make clear the fact that an aim is 
prerequisite to selection. . 
Moreover, the aim is necessary for use. Information has no 
value considered apart from its function. For different purposes 
it must be used in different ways, and thus assumes various forms. 
If topics are studied with the outstanding purpose of teaching 
morality, the moral implications will be stressed; while if training 
in social efficiency is the aim of the curriculum, then the topics 
will be considered from the point of view of their usefulness in 
assisting the individual to become the servant or the leader of 
others. Facts in the special subjects, as in chemistry, are essen- 
tially different facts when taught in the vocational course in 
agriculture from what they are in a course for pharmacists. 
Though the facts concerning carbon may seem to be the s# me 
facts irrespective of use, fundamentally carbon presents a different 
body of subject matter in relation to dietetics from carbon as 
studied for mineralogy; only a few elementary facts are the same. 
This idea may perhaps be stated more clearly if we look 
upon subject-matter-as containing not only facts but also the uses 
of those facts. For instance, the study of carbon gives us a few 
elementary facts about carbon, and in addition to these it gives 
us what we call the applications of those facts to other fields; 
and both the elementary facts and their applications are essen- 
tially parts of the subject matter to be taught. 
The failure of investigators. — While writers on the curric- | 
ulum have begun with the statement of aim, none has been able 
 
-P-A-G-E-15
  THEORY OF CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 7 
-) to derive a curriculum logically from his statement of aim. In 
every case he has made an arbitrary mental leap from the aim 
to the subject matter, without providing us with adequate prin- 
ciples such as would bridge the gap—without presenting steps 
which irresistibly lead us from aim to selection of material., This 
may seem to be a sweeping statement, but a few illustrations will 
demonstrate its accuracy. 
Plato. — In Plato’s Republic the author states his aim clearly 
as follows: “Then in our judgment the man whose natural gifts 
promise to make him the perfect guardian of the state will be 
philosophical, high-spirited, swift-footed, and strong.’”’ Proceed- 
ing with his dialectic he says: ‘This, then, will be the original 
character of our guardians, but in what way shall we rear and 
educate them?” This query he treats as follows: “What, then, 
is the education to be? Perhaps we could find hardly a better 
than that which the experience of the past has already discovered, 
which consists, I believe, in gymnastics for the body and music 
for the mind.’”’ Subsequently he analyzes gymnastics and music 
into their different divisions, and argues for the inclusion of such 
narratives, fables, and poetry as present certain ideals in the 
proper form, and adds to these certain types of melodies and 
songs. After analyzing his course in music in this way he gives 
a slight description of the course in gymnastics, while paying little 
attention to the content but emphasizing the ideals of temperate- 
ness, happiness, and health of body. 
The mental leap occurs at the point between his characteri- 
zation of the ideal guardian (‘‘philosophical, high-spirited, swift- 
footed, and strong”) and his prescription of “music and gym- 
nastics.” Plato has not taken us into his confidence and let us 
see why he thinks that the “philosophical” disposition can be 
best trained through “music and gymnastics.” He has not indi- 
cated what particular part of the censored literature is to be 
selected, nor has he shown what gymnastic exercises should be 
included in the curriculum. Is there no other material through 
which the guardian may be mage “high-spirited”? Should not 
Plato specify some of the exercises which will best promote the 
   
-P-A-G-E-16
    8 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
“swift-footed” athlete? Moreover, we are tempted to ask whether 
such a group of ideals might not also hold for the youthful citi- 
zens of America, and whether—if so—the same ideals would call 
for an identical course of study. 
Plato’s curriculum is not an adequate system of instruction 
for warriors. Within the last few years we have seen the spectacle 
of “a million men springing to arms’? who were high-spirited 
and strong, but certainly were not perfect soldiers. Before they 
could become ‘‘perfect guardians of the state” their curriculum 
was made to include much besides “fables and poetry, melodies, 
song, and gymnastics.” They had to learn to march, to shoot, 
to thrust with the bayonet, to fly in airplanes, and to sail the 
seas. Nor was Plato’s curriculum any more adequate for the 
warriors of ancient Athens. When his men were trained in music 
and gymnastics they still had much to learn before they could 
become perfect guardians of the state: they needed to be able’ 
to carry on all the forms of ancient warfare. 
Comenius.— The aims and the curriculum of Comenius present 
the same deficiency. This great educator assumes the aim of 
education to be that of bringing to maturity the seeds of learning, 
virtue, and piety planted within us by Nature. He then outlines 
his course for the vernacular school as follows (after Quick): 
“Tn this school the children should learn—first, to read and write 
the mother-tongue well, both with writing and printing letters; 
second, to compose grammatically; third, to cipher; fourth, to 
measure and weigh; fifth, to sing, at first popular airs, then from 
music; sixth, to say by heart sacred psalms and hymns; seventh, 
catechism, Bible history, and texts; eighth, moral rules with 
examples; ninth, economics and politics, as far as they could be 
understood; tenth, general history of the world; eleventh, figure 
of the earth and motion of the stars, etc., physics and geography, 
especially of native land; twelfth, general knowledge of arts and 
handicrafts.” 
This curriculum of Comenius cannot be derived logically from 
his three-fold aim of ‘learning, virtue, and piety.” Learning as 
an aim will give no basis of selection unless one cou!d expect to 
 
-P-A-G-E-17
THEORY OF CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 9 
learn everything. The interest of Comenius in his ‘“pansophy” 
indicates his belief that in a general way one might encompass 
all knowledge, but only in a general way. The details of knowledge 
could not be learned, because that task would be too great for 
the time of any individual. Selection is therefore necessary, even 
in a “pansophy,” and learning as such will not provide the basis 
for selection. Nor do virtue and piety provide this basis. Will 
ciphering, singing, or economics assist in any particularly valuable 
way in promoting these two ends? Or, to carry the question 
farther, what details of ciphering or physics will be most valu- 
able in promoting virtue and piety? Clearly, since one fact is as 
virtuous as another, subject matter cannot’ be derived from virtue 
as the aim of education. 
The cause of their failure. — The impossibility of deriving 
subject matter from the aims of Plato and Comenius is due to 
the fact that their aims are statements of ideals isolated from 
activities. For the curriculum is properly concerned not only 
with the ideals which govern life, but also with the things which 
a person does and thinks about. A virtuous carpenter does not 
perform the same actions, nor does he meet the same problems, 
as a virtuous blacksmith. A pious business man receives a differ- 
ent education from a pious doctor. A virtuous and pious China- 
man thinks and acts upon matters different from those which 
engage the attention of a similarly virtuous and pious American. 
The ideals are the same; the lives are widely different. It would 
be futile to teach the Chinaman the same curriculum as the 
American unless the intention were to Americanize him. 
The ideals are the same, but the curriculum is different; and 
it is different because it is derived from both ideals and activities. 
Some ideals, such as virtue, or swift-footedness, piety, or social 
efficiency, must be set up in the system of education; but -in 
order to determine the curriculum it is absolutely essential for a 
teacher to know the activities, problems, thoughts, or needs 
which these ideals are to influence and control. 
Plato had a golden opportunity to set a new style in cur- 
riculum construction when he described the education of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-18
10 P CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
perfect warrior. If instead of resting content with enumerating 
the qualities of his “perfect guardians,” he had analyzed their 
duties and had decided to teach swift-footedness, strength, and 
the high-spirited mind through these .activities, he would most 
powerfully have influenced the education of the next two thousand 
years. But when he had stated as his aim an zdeal, he was com- 
pelled to slip back into the rut of the traditional subjects of his 
day as the best agencies for developing this aim. And similarly, 
if Comenius had inquired into the activities of the French or the 
English citizenry, if he had found out the daily problems they 
had to meet, and had sought to make them “virtuous” and 
“pious” in their performance of these duties, he would have had a 
curriculum of. demonstrable validity. Only then would he have 
known what ciphering and economics, what music, sacred songs, 
and Biblical passages to include. In other words, he would have 
_ been able to determine not only what subjects, but what parts 
of subjects to include in his curriculum. In the absence of a 
statement of activities there is no possible way of deriving a 
curriculum from ideals. 
Spencer.— One notable attempt has been made in the past 
to analyze activities as the basis for curriculum organization, 
and in addition several current attempts have been made. Spencer, 
having set up the aim of education as complete living, analyzed 
it not by showing what qualities were necessary for complete 
living, but by indicating what activities were to be carried on. 
The analysis led him to class the activities in five divisions, hav- 
ing to do with (1) self-preservation; (2) the earning of a living; 
(8) the duties of parenthood; (4) the activities of citizenship; (5) 
occupations for leisure. 
Having interest only in the broader outlines of the subject, 
Spencer did not sub-classify these activities, but proceeded at 
once to show that the curriculum should consist of the natural 
sciences. Undoubtedly if he had taken time to analyze the ac- 
tivities more thoroughly he could have come much nearer to 
determining subject matter than the others have been able to 
come who have set up ideals and qualities as the aim of educa- 
   
-P-A-G-E-19
  THEORY OF CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 1 
tion. His failure to prove that the natural sciences are the proper 
material for the curriculum is due primarily to his failure to analyze 
the activities. His position is open to yet another criticism, of 
a more fundamental sort, to the effect that he paid no conscious 
attention to the ideals which were necessary for complete living. 
“Self-preservation” may be secured at. the expense of very im- 
portant ideals; it is frequently of less importance than the ideal 
of unselfishness. Without taking ideals into consideration, we 
cannot determine the form in which activities shall be carried 
on. The same criticism can be leveled against an activity-analysis 
such as that of Bonser, who, in The Elementary School Curriculum, 
specifies job analysis as the method to be used in determining 
what shall be taught, but fails to give equal emphasis to the ideals 
which shall dominate the activities. 
Summary. — Summarizing, we may say that in order to 
determine the content of the curriculum the aim of education 
must be stated in terms both of ideals and of activities. When 
the aim is stated in terms of ideals only, there is always a gap 
between the aim as stated and the curriculumas ostensibly 
derived from such a statement. Conversely, when ‘the activities _ 
are stated without the ideals which dominate them, there is no 
means of selecting the proper method of performing the activities.

FACTORS OPPOSED TO CHANGE 
§1—Tue Prestige or Systematic KNowLEDGE 
The result of failure to analyze. — In the absence of a com- 
bination of activities and ideals to be used as the basis for analysis, 
the investigator who includes in his aim only a statement of ideals 
unconsciously falls back upon the traditional course of study, 
which he may modify slightly or extensively, depending upon 
many factors that influence his decision. Plato, as noted above, 
accepted the conventional course of study of his time and made 
some slight modifications. Comenius made numerous modifi- 
cations of the course of study found in institutions of learning 
in his generation, the wide variety of his changes being due to 
his belief in the practicability of acquiring all learning, and in 
the wisdom of providing universal education. His curriculum 
was not derived from his ideals of “learning, virtue, and piety.” 
Rousseau, having stated his idea of the aim of education as being 
the free development of the flnatu ” of the child, selected his 
subject matter largely, it would seem to the careful reader, upon 
the basis of his own experiences as a child. That he derived it 
thus, rather than logically from his statement of aim, is due to 
the fact that the medium through which the nature of the child 
is developed varies with the child’s activities, and these depend 
partly on the surroundings in which the child is placed. 
The reason for this reversion to the conventional subjects in 
the curriculum of the day, with supplementary modifications, is 
the prestige of systematic knowledge and the value attached 
to formal discipline. The first of these we shall discuss some- 
what more fully in this section. 
The prestige of brilliance. — Education was for many cen- 
turies an undifferentiated social activity, carried on as a by- 
12 
 
-P-A-G-E-21
  FACTORS OPPOSED TO CHANGE 13 
product of the home. As the fathers and mothers earned their 
living they trained their children to perform tasks which were 
intended primarily to help the father and mother and secondarily 
to give training to the children. However, as conditions of living 
became more complex and schooling became more and more de- 
sirable in the equipment of the young, parents began to realize that 
they lacked the time and knowledge necessary to teach their chil- 
dren. The need for the school having been demonstrated, it was 
to be expected that men who knew the information to be taught 
should be selected to teach, and this led naturally to the ranks 
of scholarly men as a source of supply. In the beginning, when 
only the children of the very wealthy were taught, the teachers 
selected were those who knew to the fullest extent what had 
been gathered together by the scholars, and in many cases those 
who were themselves engaged in research. As greater interest in 
schooling developed, the law of supply and demand operated in 
such a way that the level of scholarly attainments was lowered. 
Yet in no case was a man employed who was not in some degree 
acquainted with the scholarship of his day. 
When such a man was selected the problem of developing 
the young became his problem, and his also became the problem . 
of selecting the proper subject matter by which such development 
could be obtained. It is a very significant fact that in their search 
for materials of instruction such teachers turned to the most 
brilliant and most highly organized/ material that had been 
evolved by scholars. The works of the masters became the 
textbooks of the children; no other course was easily possible. 
The lowly teacher was an admiring worshiper of the scholarship 
of the masters; no other kind seemed to be of so much worth to 
him, or therefore of so much potential value to his students. In 
such manner the method of curriculum construction which may 
be called specialistic determination came to be accepted. 
Brilliance versus use. — We should have had quite different 
curricula through the ages had the early teachers decided to use 
activity analysis as the basis and to teach the material most 
useful to the young in coping with the humble problems of their 
  pe fea

  lives. Vocational education would not have been delayed until 
the present half-century. Hygiene would probably have been in- 
cluded to a greater extent, and other items closely related to the 
life of the common people would have been inserted. 
It was, however, too much to expect that this could be done 
in the beginning, because admiration for the brilliance of the 
human mind working upon erudite problems has always been a 
dominating force in the minds of scholars, and the early teachers 
had neither the ability nor the desire to hold opinions about 
what constitutes valuable knowledge other than that contained 
in the works of the master minds. And when, at a later time, 
teachers began to be carefully prepared for their vocation, par- 
ticularly through the development of scientific methods, the idea 
that what is most brilliant is also most useful for education held 
and still holds a firm position in the pedagogic mind. Indeed, 
even to-day it verges upon bad taste to assert that many very 
brilliant products of genius ought not to be included in the course 
of study for the first twelve grades. The organized fields of knowl- 
edge have attained positions of almost unassailable strength. 
The evolution of the sciences. — These organized bodies of 
knowledge were born in very humble surroundings. Botany was 
first studied by the women of the tribe, who sought for simple 
herbs to cure common diseases. Zodlogy began with observation 
of the habits of wild and domesticated animals, and the subject 
of astronomy was first studied by the dwellers in open spaces 
who guided their steps by the sun, the moon,—and the stars. 
When to these pursuits were added the ingredients of curiosity 
and wonder it came to pass after many centuries that men of 
leisure devoted all their time to the investigation of one or another” 
of these fields, with the result that they detached the material 
from its practical relations and divested it of the concrete situ- 
ations which fettered investigation. The abstraction of. the 
material from concrete situations gave free play to curiosity, 
which, guided by the logical machinery of the human mind, could 
therefore make spectacular discoveries. So it was only when 
number became an abstract science that the brilliant discoveries 
 
-P-A-G-E-23
  FACTORS OPPOSED TO CHANGE 15 
of arithmetic, algebra, and the calculi became possible; and it 
was only after botany, zodlogy, and chemistry became abstracted 
from their practical beginnings that it was possible for the human 
mind, following its own untrammeled urgings, to produce the 
amazing results which are now incorporated as parts of the tissue 
of these romantic subjects. 
Mental morale. — That such subjects, so developed, should. 
possess unusual importance is to be expected. The -frst-value of 
these systematic fields of knowledge as subjects of schooling lies ~ | 
in the fact that they undoubtedly add to human morale by call- 
ing to the attention of youth the brilliance of the intellectual 
achievements of genius. One can hardly fail to be filled with 
enthusiasm for the possibilities of the human mind when one 
studies the stupendous intellectual achievements exhibited in the 
findings of history, literature, art, and science. Even those 
stolid or cynical high school students who treat their studies with 
matter-of-factness or flippancy have been touched by the mag- 
nificence of human genius. 
Applications of knowledge. — The_second_value;~of greater 
importance in human progress, is the influence of the great fields 
of organized knowledge upon the practices of civilization. The 
discoveries in electricity which have made possible such con- 
veniences as electric lighting and electric power, gasoline engines, 
and rapid transportation were made by men who had no idea 
(or, at least, little interest in the idea) that electricity could be 
used for practical purposes. The X-ray was discovered and 
developed by people who, as far as we know, saw none of its 
applications to medicine or its relations to radio-activity as a 
revolutionary concept in chemistry and physics. 
Consequently much has been said in favor of the position that 
if youth can be put into possession of the principles of the arts 
and sciences it can be trusted to apply these to practical life. 
This is appealing because of the thousands of instances which 
can be mustered in which applications of the pure sciences have 
been made to engineering, to industry, to agriculttire, and to 
social welfare. The scientist, whether physical, biological, or 
 
-P-A-G-E-24
  16 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
social, has demonstrated, and perhaps never more spectacularly 
than to-day, that pure science is the greatest single practical force 
in the modern development of civilization. 
Ease of instruction. — A third value of systematic knowledge 
lies in the claim that because it 7 highly organized it-is easy to 
teach. The great fields of knowledge are for the most part based 
upon the principles which have settled as precipitates after years 
of study, during which the organization of the field has been in 
a state of fluidity. When (to change the figure) after the passage 
of a few years or generations, the contents of the field can be 
seen in perspective, the divisions and subdivisions are obvious; and 
it is then possible to select from the principles and facts in each 
field those items which, thrown into relief in elementary text- 
books, will give a well organized, bird’s-eye view of the whole field. 
Criticisms. — It would seem that with such an array of ad- 
vantages there should be no considerable weakness in the position 
that youth can best be trained by a curriculum consisting of a 
compendium of the organized fields of knowledge. But in the 
minds of many thoughtful students the case against it seems also 
to be strong. Criticism centers around such questions as the 
ability of youth to use the material in the organized fields of 
knowledge, and the disposition that is to be made of the unor- 
ganized fields of knowledge. (Those who question the super- 
lative value of such organized fields as the social and physical 
sciences, history, art, and literature, as subjects of the course of 
study, raise objections to the items included. They take the 
position that some elements of the organized fields will necessarily 
be included, but they believe, also, that many items from the 
unorganized fields must likewise be inserted.) They assert that 
it is a mistake to select material from the Organized field upon 
the basis of providing a miniature model of the systematic organ- 
ization. They maintain that the material to be used from each 
field should be selected because of its practical usefulness. They 
are less concerned with giving some acquaintance with all the 
subdivisions of each field than with including only such parts 
of the subdivisions as will function in practical life,
-P-A-G-E-25
   FACTORS OPPOSED TO CHANGE al 
What is practical? — By practical life is meant not alone—or 
* even primarily—the earning of a living. The practical man must, 
£ to be sure, have a vocation, but besides vocation he has many 
other interests. He has, for instance, problems of art, such as 
the decoration of his home, the selection of his clothes, and the 
beautification of his city. He is confronted with the need of 
choosing books to read, music to appreciate, and pictures to 
enjoy.. He must in addition perform the duties of citizenship, of 
religion, of morals, and of manners. Practical life consists in 
the dealings and activities embraced in the conduct of well- 
rounded members of society. 
Organized knowledge constantly changes. — When it is claimed 
that a. compendium of the great fields of organized knowledge 
does not necessarily provide the best training for such an indi- 
vidual, the claim is based uscn four considerations. It is pointed 
out in the first place that ghe organized fields of knowledge are 
constantly changing. They are organized and reorganized from 
different points of view as the problems of one generation of scien- 
tists give way to the problems of the succeeding generation. In 
  the popular mind the facts of the sciences have a metaphysical ~ 
finality and a corresponding sanctity, but in the minds of scientists 
no such illusion exists. They know that the sciences are the product 
of the human mind, and that among investigators fashions rule 
with definite power. The problems which one generation works 
upon are not those which will stimulate their successors. For 
instance, while systematic botany prior to 1860 was concerned 
with the classifying of plants, a new science of botany was devel- 
oped after Darwin; and this differed from its predecessors much 
more markedly than the hoop skirt and bustle of the same period 
differed from the attenuated skirts of to-day. Again, as late as 
1890, the problems of the anatomy of plants were in the fore- 
ground, and the systematic high school texts were anatomical in 
content; but by 1900 the problems found in the textbooks were 
physiological, so that instead of finding the high school botany 
systematizing the parts of plants we snd it dealing with the 
physiological functions. What has happened in botany happens 
    
 
-P-A-G-E-26
CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
in every science. Any science is the product of the intellectual 
energy of alert men who, because they are in love with the game, 
are always open to new suggestions and very frequently leave 
one part of their field for another part before all the problems of 
the first are solved. Obviously, then, the problems of the or-— 
ganized fields change, as is right and proper and natural; and as 
the problems change the structure of the field changes so that 
the compendium of to-day does not have the same content as 
that of yesterday. 
This line of reasoning inevitably leads one to this question: 
If scientists select from their fields that material which solves 
their problems, why may not the layman ask them to select for 
him that part of their material which will be of use to him in solv- 
‘ing his problems? ‘The scientist organizes his field around his 
own problems, and therefore ought to be willing to organize 
the contributing parts of his field around the problems of other 
people. 
Acquisition and application.—In the second place, it is 
claimed that the application of knowledge is more difficult than 
its acquisition. The applications of chemistry and physics, 
taken in the large, have been made by a multitude of investi- 
gators, each working on a specific application. But it is to be 
noted that this has been accomplished by a group of individuals 
working upon specific problems. _To this they devoted their 
major energies for an extended time, and by singleness of devotion 
were able to accomplish remarkable results. But it is one thing 
to say that one person is able to make one application, and quite 
a different thing to assert that one person can make all the appli- 
cations, particularly when he has not specialized narrowly upon 
any phase of the*problem. It may be granted that one appli- 
cation can be made by one specialist, and still be contended 
with force that a single specialist cannot make all the applications; 
still more strongly can it be contended that all the applications 
could not be made by one layman, no matter how brilliant he 
might be. Both principles and their applications must be taught. 
 
-P-A-G-E-27
  FACTORS OPPOSED TO CHANGE 19 
Motivation. —It is claimed in the third place that when 
knowledge is divorced from the consciousness of usefulness it is 
extremely difficult to motivate. While it is acknowledged that 
there is a small proportion of individuals who are natively en- 
dowed with such an electric alertness that their curiosity will 
stimulate them to the study of everything that is new, yet any- 
one who will make an inventory of his acquaintances will readily 
agree that the number of such people is small, and that univer- 
sality of curiosity is not typical of the great mass of people. 
The critics of the public school lay the blame for this narrow- 
ness of curiosity upon the methods of instruction in the school, 
but this criticism is not well founded. The lack is based rather 
upon the psychology of the individual. Certainly the high school 
student has a broader range of interest than the adult, but even _ 
among such students there is continual criticism of their subjects 
of study on the ground of lack of vitality. This cannot be dis- 
missed with the statement that they ought to be interested, or 
that the teaching is inadequate. It is rather due to the fact that 
people are chiefly curious about matters which affect them closely, 
and are not normally curious about the things for which they 
see no use. 
Usefulness. —It is not claimed that the material contained 
in the sciences is not useful. Every product of human effort has 
been developed in an effort to assist in the solution of some 
problem, and the materials of the scientist are not an exception 
to this rule. But they are the solutions of the problems of the 
scientist and not of those of the layman. Consequently we often 
find that the high school student, even though he possess a wider 
range of interest than the adult, does not appreciate the prob- 
lems of pure science, whatever latent or active interest he may 
have in their popular phases. It follows, therefore, that we are 
not so much concerned with the differences between use and 
non-use as we are with differences in the uses which may be made 
of the specialists’ material. It frequently happens, as has been 
said, that while youthful students have little interest in the 
specialists’ problems they may be keenly interested in practical, 
     
-P-A-G-E-28
  0 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
lay problems connected with the field. If there is any apprecia- 
tion of the use of the material, they will recognize its value; 
but if the problems which the material solves are not appreciated, 
motivation will be lacking. While it is one of the duties of 
the school to increase the range of curiosity, a widened range 
of interest can be secured as a social measure not by presenting 
a wide range of material to learn, but by making the student 
more keenly sensitive to the use and application of the facts 
which are presented to him for acquisition. 
Unorganized fields.— The thoughtful student of education 
sees a fourth weakness in the course of study composed of the 
systematized fields of knowledge. He feels that to equip youth 
properly for the problems of maturity, instruction must be 
given in the current, unorganized social problems of the day. 
For instance, we have facing us now the problems of labor, direct 
action, governmental control, and the participation of workers in 
the profits and administration of business, but the facts concern- 
ing these are not usually taught in the grades or in the high 
school. Whether they can be taught with complete adequacy 
or not is beside the point; the student must face the problems 
either with inadequate information or with none. 
The chief reason why they are not taught is that they are 
not organized sufficiently to be easily placed in textbooks. A 
textbook writer hesitates to insert problems in his text, no matter 
how pressing, unless they have been under discussion sufficiently 
long to have the material organized for their solution. There 
seems to be a strong bias against including anything that has 
not been systematically arranged. To be sure, this material 
might be placed in the books in the form of current problems, 
the arguments of both sides of the controversy being presented as 
an aid toward solution; but it is almost bad form for an author 
to present a collection of these rather than a system, even though 
the problems be vital and pressing for action, when no person 
is yet able to systematize it. Such tragedies fill the pages of 
the history of the curriculum, for often by the time the material
-P-A-G-E-29
  FACTORS OPPOSED TO CHANGE 21 
has become systematized the “psychological moment” for its 
practical use has gone forever. 
Possibly the most serious criticism of the systematized fields 
of knowledge as the sole material for the curriculum is found 
in the fact that they do not contain solutions for many important 
problems which confront the layman. This is particularly notice- 
able in connection with the field of “applied” psychology. To 
students of this subject it is no new information that the prob- 
lems which have been most fully investigated in psychology are 
those which deal with cognition and habit, while comparatively 
little has been done with the feelings and emotions. As soon, 
however, as we study the practical problems of the management 
of men, for instance, we find that the most important element 
of control is the feelings, and that men are swayed less by in- 
tellect than they are by emotion. Yet when the practical psy- 
chologist goes to his major field for solutions to his problems, 
he obtains no assistance, for the reason already stated: that 
psychology has not investigated the problems with which he is | 
concerned. It is therefore apparent to him, and through him to 
all of us, that since the organized field is inadequate it must 
be supplemented by material taken from other sources. 
Required and elective courses. — The foregoing statements 
will not be subject to such severe criticism if a distinction be 
made between required and elective courses. Through the latter, 
the high school student who possesses the interests of the specialist 
finds it possible to pursue his study in any field, to the full limits 
of the opportunities offered in his school. Concerning such 
elective, independent courses, no criticism is raised in this 
connection. The problems which are investigated appeal to the 
mind of the specialist as being worthy. His judgment is not 
subject to review by men outside the field. 
Required courses, on the other hand, since they are imposed 
on all students, irrespective of individual differences in interest, 
have to be considered from another point of view. They are 
studied not because of the scientific problems which they solve; 
their inclusion in the course of study is dependent upon their  
-P-A-G-E-30
22 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
usefulness to laymen outside of the field of specialists. Were 
they not required of everybody, criticisms could not be raised 
upon the points just mentioned. But once they become required, 
then they have to show, item by item, that their content is 
directly useful for the conduct of the layman. 
However, even in the case of these elective high school sub- 
jects which are studied to prepare for future specialization in 
college and university, some objections are encountered. Science 
teachers in colleges often say that they prefer to have the student 
come to them without high school training in their subject; 
that they find his technique faulty, and that instead of their, 
having a tabula rasa to work on when the student enters, they 
must erase many false impressions. But the common answer— 
that the earlier teaching is to blame—is not correct. More prop- 
erly, the difficulty lies in the fact that the student has had labo- 
ratory methods imposed on him before he has the necessary 
mental interest and physical skill to master them. And it is 
possibly better, in view of this immaturity, that high school 
students should have only general science courses—even those 
students who later become specialists—and that these general 
courses be based upon practical use. 
Summary. —Systematized knowledge has been made the 
subject of instruction in the schools from the beginning because 
the teachers selected on the grounds of scholarship, considered 
that the brilliant products of the human mind provided the 
best equipment for youth. The great fields of knowledge have 
spectacular prestige because they throw into relief the naked 
brilliance of the human mind, because they are responsible for 
many advances of civilization, and because they are easy to 
present in systematized form. / Doubt has been expressed from 
time to time as to their adequacy in training for practical life, 
because of the difficulty of applying the principles and facts 
of the abstract sciences to concrete situations, and because many 
- of the principal facts contained in these fields do not apply to 
the everyday problems of the layman. As a substitute for a bird’s 
eye view of the fields of knowledge it is proposed that the selec- 
 
-P-A-G-E-31
  FACTORS OPPOSED TO CHANGE 23 
tion be made from both the systematized and the unsystematized 
fields of knowledge, upon the basis of practical use—by which 
is meant usefulness in performing the activities and inculcating 
the ideals necessary for living a well-rounded life. 
§2—Formau Discipline 
Its acceptance. — When schoolmen fell back upon traditional 
material after their failures to derive a curriculum from ideals, 
they met from time to time a heavy bombardment of criticism 
and censure. There have always been objectors who have claimed 
that such a curriculum does not meet the needs of youth. At 
this point the forces of conservatism produced the defense provided 
by the doctrine of formal discipline. 
The doctrine of formal discipline met with general acceptance 
at the close of the seventeenth and the beginning of the eighteenth 
centuries. At this time the course of study was encountering 
severe criticism on the ground that the narrow humanitarian 
curriculum which had been enthusiastically introduced a few 
centuries before as a result of the influence of the Renaissance 
did not adequately prepare for life. It was at this time that | 
Locke, the philosopher and psychologist, crystallized the idea, / c 
germs of which are found scattered throughout’ the writings | Tare 4n | 
of the great educators before his day, that mental ‘training / | 
could be transferred wholesale from one subject to another. It) > ~ ining | 
was asserted, for instance, that memory is a faculty which, when| 7 
. trained by the study of one subject, such as Latin, will function ° 
adequately in the remembering ofixnames and faces; and that 
reasoning when developed in mathematics will work equally we 
in trade. 
Its record. — This principle of the transfer of training has 
occupied an unenviable position in modern education. It has 
added no subject to the course of study. It has probably added 
no new methods of instruction, because the age at whose close 
it was elaborated is notable in education for its technique in ob- 
taining thoroughness of instruction. The principle has been 
merely the bulwark of conservatism; tlie last argument—after 
 
-P-A-G-E-32
  24 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
others have failed—upon which to base the retention of subjects 
in the course of study or to oppose changes within the subject. 
It is an educational eddy in which many items of instruction 
have been held, which, in the ordinary course of educational 
progress, would long since have floated down into the ocean of 
oblivion. For it has appeared to be obvious that, if training is 
the end of education, and if it can be obtained in certain subjects, 
then, no matter how far removed they are from practical use- 
fulness, it would be unwise to invite trouble and unrest by 
changing. : 
Its present status. — At the beginning of the twentieth cen- 
tury the first serious attack upon the claim of wholesale transfer 
was made by Thorndike, and his criticism has since been elabo- 
rated by many investigators. Since that time the educational 
world has been superficially divided into three classes. Naturally 
there are those who view any attack upon the transfer of train- 
ing with suspicion and in some cases with alarm. There is a 
second group, of very large: proportions, that maintains essen- 
_-tially that there is no transfer. And there is a third group, the 
\ most constructive and powerful of the three, which is endedvor- 
| ing to find just how much can be salvaged from the remains of 
this once magnificent structure, and be put to use. Thorndike 
| says that there is transfer where there is identity of substance 
| and procedure; Bagley claims that ideals may be transferred, 
| and Ruediger adds that this is particularly true if the ideals 
are made conscious; Colvin shows that many general habits can 
| be transferred, when habits which are called general are really 
| specific habits of general application; Judd holds that generali- 
_ zations may be transferred; and other writers have made other 
additions. 
But whatever may finally be saved from the wreck—and at 
present the process of salvaging occupies the attention of those 
engaged in studying the subject—there is no doubt that whole- 
sale transfer as the sole principle of selection of subject matter 
is permanently discarded. Fortunately, even if it were ultimately 
reinstated in its former commanding position, the attacks de-
-P-A-G-E-33
  FACTORS OPPOSED TO CHANGE 25 
livered against it have already produced excellent results. The 
last ten years have shown that when those subjects which have 
been resting in lassitude beneath the shadow of formal discipline 
have been brought out into the sunlight of constructive thought 
in an effort to find and utilize the functions which they conserve, 
they have been enriched and vitalized through fusion with practi- 
cal values generated by investigation. 
A conservative position. — The safe position for investigators 
to take in matters concerning the curriculum is that the training 
of abilities should be carried on in connection with material as 
close to normal situations as is possible. If memory is to be 
trained for use in practical situations, then it should be trained in 
material as nearly practical as possible. If discrimination in color 
is to be trained, exercises should deal with color and not be con- 
fined to the learning of discrimination -through the study of 
technical points of language and grammar. (The training should) 
be given in situations as nearly normal as possible, and the sup+, 
porters of any subject are wise when they assume that formal 
discipline is not one of the arguments in favor of retention of) 
their subject) Tf this position is taken, other functions will be 
found which have an enriching influence upon the subject, and 
if by any chance there should be a large degree of transfer of 
training, it will be added as a value supplementary to the other 
values. 
The foregoing description of the influences which have handi- 
capped the modification of the curriculum to meet the changing 
demands of succeeding ages prepares the way for a statement of 
the methods which may be utilized in obtaining more thorough- 
going and rapid results. The query is: What will the curriculum 
be like if one starts with ideals and activities and proceeds by 
logical processes, taking into account the developmental stages 
of youth and the individual differences of children in each stage, 
together with a consideration of the environment in which the 
school is situated? The answer to this is found partly in the 
realm of theory and partly in results obtained from specific studies 
which have been carried on during the last decade.
-P-A-G-E-34
    26 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
If we may state briefly the proposed plan of the text, we shall 
attempt to show that the following rules may be laid down for 
the construction of the curriculum: First, determine the ideals 
and activities which constitute the major objectives; second, 
analyze these and continue the analysis until working units are 
obtained; third, arrange them in order of importance; fourth, 
raise to positions of high rank in these lists those ideals and 
activities which are of great value for children even though low 
in value for adults; fifth, determine the number of most important 
ideals and activities which can be mastered in the time allotted 
to school, after eliminating those which can be learned outside 
of school; sixth, collect the best practices of the race in teaching 
, these ideals and activities; and seventh, arrange the material in 
\ proper instructional order, according to the psychological nature 
\of children and the texture of the material.
-P-A-G-E-35
  Cuapter III 
IDEALS 
Satisfaction is subjective.— All men strive to secure satis- 
faction through the performance of activities under the control 
of their ideals. This is the great formal objective of life and as 
such determines the aim of education. For education isthe social 
agency which trains youth so that it may secure satisfaction 
through activities which are governed by the ideals that society 
thinks are valuable. This statement resolves itself into three 
concepts: satisfaction, ideals, and activities. 
Satisfaction is psychological in the sense that it is the tag 
which we place upon successful activity. If the activity is satis- 
fying, then so far as the individual is concerned it is successful. 
Conversely, dissatisfaction is the sign of failure in the sense that 
for the individual no activity which produces dissatisfaction is 
by him considered to be successful. 
Dissatisfaction is the motive for the performance of activities, 
and satisfaction is the goal sought through activity. When 
the individual is entirely satisfied with the performance of an 
activity there is no reason for a change. Change in activities 
occurs only when the individual is dissatisfied with their present 
form, and his purpose in making a change is to replace dissatis- 
faction by later satisfaction. 
Satisfaction possesses the peculiarity of being subjective. 
The activity which satisfies one person may not satisfy another. 
We can say whether one action produces more satisfaction than 
another for no one save ourselves. Nor can we affirm for another 
individual that one act produces a higher or more intense sort 
of satisfaction than another, though there may be such distinctions. 
So we can classify the actions upon the basis of satisfaction, 
which is subjective, only when we translate it into approximate 
equivalents which are objective. 
27 iV
-P-A-G-E-36
  28 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
Ideals are objective. — This has led the race through the 
ages to rationalize satisfaction and to make broad judgments 
concerning the kinds of actions which produce in general more 
of satisfaction than of dissatisfaction. Thinking men have ob- 
served that certain classes of action are, on the testimony of 
many people, more likely to satisfy than to lead to dissatisfaction, 
and these actions they have described as honest, loyal, or generous. 
At the same time, others which produce, in the long run, more 
of dissatisfaction than of satisfaction they have classified as 
dishonest, disloyal, or selfish actions. So honesty, loyalty, and 
generosity have come to be called good ideals, or high ideals, 
and their opposites bad or low ideals. They are the objective 
equivalents of satisfaction or dissatisfaction. 
“Tdeals” is a more convenient term to use than “satisfaction.” 
This can be seen quite clearly in the light of one or two illus- 
trations. For instance, in a discussion an individual may say 
either “That action satisfies me” or “That action is honest.” 
It is quite clear that I, as an observer, cannot know nearly so 
surely the objective value of the action when the individual says 
that it is satisfying as when he says that it is honest. Satisfac- 
tion is subjective, so this action may satisfy him and still not be 
socially desirable, or desirable for him if he were to take the long 
view of his life and actions; but as soon as he says that it is honest, 
then I have—as an observer—a clear idea of the objective value 
of the action. I know that in the long run it will be an action 
that is satisfactory to many people and is most likely to be 
eventually satisfactory to the individual who made the state- 
ment. So, ideals are efficient devices for the discussion and 
handling of activities in relation to their capacity for providing 
satisfaction. 
Satisfaction versus ideals.— It must be noted in passing that 
there is uot always complete harmony between satisfaction and 
ideals, for since satisfaction is immediate and individual (while - 
ideals are based upon long-term percentages and upon social 
consensus) it often happens that the action with a low ideal may 
be immediately satisfying, while one with a high ideal is quite
-P-A-G-E-37
IDEALS ; 29 
the opposite. For instance, it may be much more satisfying at 
the moment to steal than to be honest, but we know that in the 
long run thievery will produce a higher percentage of dissatis- 
faction. We can get a consensus of opinion upon the relative 
value of ideals and so can readily distinguish one from another. 
We know that honesty is better than dishonesty and that these 
are different from generosity or loyalty. We know this because 
ideals are objective and because the race has been thinking 
about them from the beginning as means for attaining satisfaction. 
Because ideals are more objective than satisfaction and there- 
fore more easily studied, it is preferable to use them as materials 
for the construction of the curriculum. This is true because in 
recognizing them we do not discard the factor of satisfaction, 
since in making the assumption that efficient ideals are satis- 
fying, and inefficient ideals are dissatisfying, we keep the con- 
nection by implication. 
Activities and ideals. — Activities are the means oie 
which dissatisfaction is eliminated and satisfaction is obtained. 
The term so used includes both physical actions and mental 
activity. The range of activities is broader than the popular 
conception, which confines the definition to the physical field. 
Such an interpretation gives only a superficial idea of activity, 
since it is just as accurate to speak of moral, social, religious, or 
aesthetic activities as of physical actions. Unless we give activity 
this breadth of content it is not possible for us to claim that 
men strive to secure satisfaction through activities under the 
domination of ideals. 
Activities partly independent.— From the point of view of 
the construction of the curriculum, it is important to understand 
the relationship between ideals and activities. In the first place, 
ideals are not the sole source of activities. The normal behavior 
of man consists of activities which produce satisfaction and destroy 
dissatisfaction. They are based upon his instincts and impulses. 
They are dependent partly upon his original nature and partly 
upon his environment. What sort of actions he will perform is 
determined not only by his ideals but also by his original nature 
 
-P-A-G-E-38
  30 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
and by his geography. His actions are therefore limited by many 
factors. The structure of his body, the capacities of his mind, 
and his instincts are determinants of his action; so also is his 
environment, physical and social. 
At the beginning of a day’s work the individual does not 
normally set out with the objective of attaining any ideals. 
Only occasionally does he say to himself, ‘‘To-day I shall do those 
things which will-make me honest and generous and efficient.’’ 
Rather he starts out with problems which are couched in terms 
of activity. He plans for himself the eating of his meals, the 
transaction of business with his associates, and the performance 
of personal duties. He has problems to solve and needs to satisfy 
which are not primarily concerned with ideals. The presence of 
dissatisfaction merely impels him to strike out toward new 
actions, so that he may be rid of his dissatisfaction and some- 
where obtain satisfaction. His actions do not originate in satis- 
faction or in ideals. Satisfaction is only the sign that he has 
arrived. 
Ideals are standards. — Ideals are standards of action rather’ 
than originators of activity. They are the belated products of 
the human race, formulated by long-continued thought. They 
enable us to judge of the efficiency of action in producing satis- 
faction. We do not usually perform actions to show that we 
are honest, but rather we solve some problem and, before accept- 
ing one solution in preference to another, we apply the standard 
of honesty. What we have in view at any moment is a line of 
action which is censored by our ideals. If, when judged by the 
ideal, an action is below standard, we seek for some other line 
of action which will satisfy the demands made upon it, or we 
gmodify the present solution so as to make it conform to our 
standards. In some cases, we may discard the high standard in 
favor of immediate satisfaction and take chances on the future 
outcome. : 
Motivation. — In the second place the failure to realize ideals, 
which results in feelings of difficulty, pain, and inferiority, pro- 
duces a motive for the performance of activity. We have just 
 
-P-A-G-E-39
Fe Be RRR OEE nen ae TN eT ee ee ee ee 
IDEALS 31 
seen that activities are not prompted by ideals alone, and that 
they are dependent upon other factors as well. We are now lay- 
ing stress upon the fact that when activity of any sort has been 
initiated, the method of motivation is through some form of 
dissatisfaction in connection with the ideals. If the ideais are 
satisfying, the activity will continue unchanged. If the ideals are 
not satisfying, then the activities will be modified. The motive 
for change is the obtaining of an activity which will conform 
to the ideals. 
Ideals are fluent.—In the third place, activities are less 
fluid than ideals. In the formation of the curriculum we can 
determine with considerable exactness what the activities are 
which are carried on by the individual. This can be done with 
some degree of scientific precision; but when it comes to the 
determination of what ideals shall operate we have no standards 
so precise as those by which we measure activities; whether 
honesty or courtesy shall be the ideals of the student or the 
school, whether open-mindedness or artistic taste shall dominate 
as the controlling ideals, cannot be settled by scientific measure- 
ment. We have to fall back upon individual opinion or upon 
the consensus of the group, and this results in wide divergence 
of opinion. 
This fact, which is dependent upon the individuality of human 
nature, is rich in significance. We have never been able to get 
all men to agree upon the relative importance of ideals, and as 
a consequence of this we have the widest possibilities of diver- 
gence in individual development, carrying in its train a richness 
of individual and social life. If all men held exactly the same 
ideals, we should long ago have been reduced to the level of 
machines, without the power of adaptation and change; but 
because different men in different localities and in different gener- 
ations have held different ideals and have, with intensity of pur- 
pose, sought to realize them, enriching contributions have been 
made to our civilization from generation to generation. 
Individuality. — It is, therefore, entirely’ defensible for a 
faculty by vote of its members to set up for instruction any ideals 
    
-P-A-G-E-40
    32 . CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
which it believes to be most valuable. There is a place in a grow-— 
ing democracy for people whose faith rests.in the values of aca- 
demic education alongside of institutions which have vocational 
ideals. It is fortunate that certain institutions and men stress 
the religious ideals, and that others stress physical ideals—for- 
tunate because each group can make its contribution to the 
total social life of the nation. 
But, though the relative importance of ideals for a school 
may be determined by the faculty, their judgment must not be 
lightly or arbitrarily formed. The social demand must be studied 
so as to enable the faculty to interpret the spirit of the age. To 
this end, the opinions of thoughtful men and women in public 
and private life, as expressed in speech or writing, need to be 
carefully weighed. Not only so, but a thoroughgoing investi- 
gation of the needs of the students who are to be instructed must 
be followed through. From all sources, the faculty must gather 
data upon which to base their judgment. 
Ideals and activities. — Ideals cannot be abstracted from 
activities. When they are so abstracted they fail to function in 
conduct. Honesty as an ideal will function in conduct only when 
it is made concrete in action. The Golden Rule is inoperative in 
behavior unless it be carried out in unselfish actions. No man 
can be said to possess an ideal unless he can exemplify it in terms 
of conduct. 
Courtesy means nothing except as translated into action. 
Only as courtesy means, for a.boy, allowing older people to pre- 
cede, lifting the hat to a lady, and running an errand for a friend, 
is it significant at all. Stated positively, ideals must be made 
concrete in order to function. The task of the teacher who wishes 
to inculcate ideals in the lives of children must necessarily be to 
analyze type activities to which an ideal applies, and see that 
the selected ideal is applied in connection with such selected 
actions. Not otherwise is it possible to develop standards which 
will forcefully function in the minds and hearts of men. 
Summary. —In this section we have endeavored to show 
that ideals are the objective forms of satisfaction, and that as 
ta 
 
-P-A-G-E-41
IDEALS 33 
such it is possible to apply them as standards to actions. Activi- 
ties are the outgrowth of the rich inheritance of the individual 
and his environment, carried on under the censorship of ideals. 
As such, the ideal is fluid, while the activity is objectively definite. 
Since this is the case, there is no concrete separation between 
the ideal and the activity. . Activities are not carried on without 
ideals to govern, ‘and ideais will not operate except through 
activities.

ANALYSIS OF ACTIVITIES 
Job analysis is familiar. — Analysis of activities is not an 
unfamiliar operation. It has long been used as a method of 
instruction, but its application has not been wide and the present. 
emphasis upon analysis is an effort not so much to use a new 
method as to make wide application of a method which has been 
used for a long time in a few situations. 
The recipe one type. — One of the simplest forms in which 
the analysis of activities is used is in recipes for cooking. 
-The recipe shows the items in the order of their performance and 
supposedly in terms of the working units of the cook. As an 
illustration of a recipe we have the following: 
French Dressing 
4 cup olive oil 
5 tablespoons vinegar 
% teaspoon powdered sugar 
1 tablespoon finely chopped Bermuda onion 
2 tablespoons finely chopped parsley 
4 red peppers 
8 green peppers 
1 teaspoon salt 
Mix ingredients in the order given. 
Let stand one hour. 
Then stir vigorously for five minutes. 
In this recipe we have an implied problem; superficially it is 
to make a salad dressing. Presumably a cook who understands 
the terms could use this as a textbook, or course of study, and 
produce a more or less satisfactory salad dressing. 
34 
 
-P-A-G-E-43
  
ANALYSIS OF ACTIVITIES. . 35 
All directions for doing anything are based upon job analyses. 
Courses in cooking (as just suggested), in sewing, in embroidery, 
swimming, and all forms of physical exercise, are examples of 
analysis thrown into the form of directions. 
A formal job analysis. — A somewhat more formal sort of 
analysis is that which is known as the job analysis. Used at 
first in the vocations as a device in the employment offices of 
organizations which were too large for the employment officer 
to be familiar with the duties of all the jobs in the organization, 
it spread very rapidly and came to have its greatest usefulness 
and largest amount of publicity in connection with the Army 
during the World War. While its widest use in the vocations 
has been in connection with employment, its most valuable use 
is in connection with training programs. 
Another example of the analysis of a simple job is that of the 
position of application clerk in a department store, which is 
given as follows: 
1. Meets people who desire to open accounts. 
Asks them for the information to fill out blank. “ 
Writes form letters or telephones for references. 
Fills out Mercantile Agency blanks. 
Looks up rating in Dunn’s, ete. 
Files applications temporarily till references come in. 
Makes notes of references on blanks and hands to Credit 
Chief, who passes on them. 
8. Enters name, address, and number of applications in 
index. 
9. Answers requests from other firms for references. ioe ote CoE) 
In this table are shown nine duties which the application 
clerk has to perform, and clearly the course of study needed to 
train such a clerk will deal with the nine topics. It should teach 
him how to meet people who desire to open accounts, how to ask 
them for information with which to fill out blanks, how to write 
form letters, how to get information over the telephone, etc. 
When the student has been taught each of these topics accord- 
     
-P-A-G-E-44
    ee ee eee os or 
36 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
ing to ideals which would necessarily be inciuded, all the theory 
needed by him has been presented. 
Other cases. — The foregoing analyses of the tasks of cook 
and cf clerk are two very simple analyses. In both we see 
that it is possible to make a minute analysis of the operations 
to be performed in carrying on a job and we infer that it would 
be possible to list the ideals governing the performance of each 
activity. This will be demonstrated later. These are simple 
cases of analysis, but in more complex operations the same methods 
are involved. Noel (p. 278)* has made a more complicated analysis, 
in which he lists machine operations involving the computation 
of revolutions per minute, and this presents a tiny curriculum re- 
quiring considerable skill and a somewhat difficult course of study. 
Allen (p. 274) likewise analyzes many operations in machine drilling 
and shows not only the processes involved in these operations 
but derives from them the fundamental mechanical science and 
art necessary to understand them. Greene (p. 287) enumerates the 
processes involved in sheep-raising and presents all the available 
experimental information to explain the basis for the accepted 
~ methods. Rising to a still more complicated level, Strong (p. 292) 
makes an analysis of the duties of executives in forty plants, 
and after classifying them derives, with the aid of his associates, 
a complete curriculum for the commercial engineering depart- 
ment of a technical school. 
Informational analysis.—In each of the foregoing illustra- 
tions the analysis has had to do with processes which are carried 
on step after step, but the same method is used with some modi- 
fications in the gathering of information. In this case the function 
which the collected material is to serve is subjected to a prelim- 
inary analysis in order that it may become the controlling element 
of the investigation. 
An illustration. — For instance, in connection with retail sell- 
ing curricula, when the problem is that of collecting information 
*Page references in parentheses appearing after proper names are cita- 
tions of studies found in Part II. 
 
-P-A-G-E-45
  ANALYSIS OF ACTIVITIES 37 
useful to shoe salesmen, the first step is to determine and analyze 
the purpose for which shoes are purchased. The analysis yields 
a list of five values in which customers are conceivably interested. 
Perhaps not all customers are interested in all the values, yet 
each value will interest some customers, and the salesman must 
accordingly have information covering each. These five values 
are the durability of the merchandise; its serviceability for differ- 
ent occasions; the perfection of its fit; the up-to-dateness of its 
fashion; and the comfort or ease derived from wearing it. As will 
be shown later, such an analysis enables the collectors of infor- 
mation to select those facts in connection with leathers and 
their preparation, manufacture, and production which explain 
how differences in the enumerated values are obtained. For 
instance, it is possible to select from the manufacturing processes 
those facts which explain why one shoe is more durable than 
another and, in terms of the structure of the foot and the shoe, 
why one is a better fit than another. 
In a similar way values which customers seek in the purchase 
of textiles are analyzed for assistance in collecting information 
for the textile salesman. There are added to the list of values 
in shoes, just quoted, such values as the becomingness of gar- 
ments, the launderability of materials, the fineness of materials 
and of garments, and the satisfaction that comes from knowing 
that the article is exclusive or hand-made or antique. 
Duties versus performance.— To avoid confusion at this 
point or later, it is advisable to remark that an analysis may 
result either in a list of duties or in a list of methods of perform- 
ing duties. There is no line of demarcation between duties and 
their performance, because the methods of performing any duty 
are simply the details constituting a larger activity called the 
duty. For instance, in the case of the application clerk, a number 
of duties are listed such as meeting customers and asking for 
information. But this list does not state the detailed activities 
utilized in performing such a duty—it does not show what one 
would actually do in “meeting customers.” If, however, we 
should analyze the duty of meeting a customer, we would obtain
-P-A-G-E-46
  
  38 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
yet another list of component duties, such as greeting her courte- 
ously, asking her to take a seat, inquiring into the object of her 
visit, ete. This, then, would be a duty analysis, its units combin- 
ing to constitute the method of performing the duty of “meet- 
ing customers.” 
Methods of making job analyses.— There are at least four 
methods of making a job analysis: ; 
(1) Introspection. — This is the method used by the person 
who is already familiar with the job whose duties are to be 
analyzed. To make a job analysis of the duties of a Sunday 
School teacher, a person who has taught a Sunday School class 
would naturally begin by listing all the duties that have come 
within his experience. The printer who purposes making an analy- 
sis of his occupation will likewise list all the duties of which he 
ean think. The public school teacher will list the duties met in 
the classroom. 
But it is probably not sufficient—at any rate it is neither safe 
nor economical of time—to trust to one’s own unassisted analysis. 
Even if one is familiar with the job, it is better to supplement 
introspection. If one is not familiar with it, it is better to begin 
with interviewing. 
(2) Interviewing. — By this second method the interviewer 
asks the individual on the job to give a list of his duties; after 
the list has been jotted down by the interviewer and typewritten, 
it is returned to the worker for correction. Other workers on the 
same job are also interviewed independently, and later the lists 
of the workers are compared in order to get a composite group. 
In every case a man in authority who knows the job is asked to 
check the list and add whatever items have been left out. 
(8) Working on the job. — The foregoing method is perhaps 
most convenient because it takes the least time, but in some cases 
a third methed is used by the analyst. He works on the job and 
carries through the operations himself. The advantage of this 
method is that the investigator comes to the job with scant knowl- 
edge of its processes, and therefore is better able to analyze it 
than are old-timers, since with him none of the duties has become 
 
-P-A-G-E-47
  
  ANALYSIS OF ACTIVITIES 39 
habitual; but its weakness is that it requires a great deal of time, 
so that investigators generally feel that better results are secured 
by many very careful interviews than by having one individual 
work upon the job until he knows it thoroughly. 
(4) Questionnaire.— The written questionnaire -is some- 
times used as a method of analysis, but for reasons which will 
be noted later (Chap. XIII, Sec. 6) it is not satisfactory in yield- 
ing more than a preliminary list, and even for this it is so in- 
ferior to the interview that its use is not recommended except 
in extreme cases. 
Complete analysis. — The aim in all of this work is to make 
the list of duties as nearly complete as possible. This is particu- 
larly difficult to do, especially in mental operations, where one 
cannot see the steps carried out in connection with material. 
To analyze, for instance, the activities of a woman during a 
day is no simple task. It is comparatively easy to make a list 
of the things she does with her hands, because an observer can 
see these; but to list the things she thinks about no one can 
do save herself, and even she is unable to make a complete list 
of them. To illustrate this difficulty, and the care needed in meet- 
ing it, reference may be made to the collection of three hundred 
diaries (p. 328) gathered for the purpose of securing analyses of 
women's activities, and contributing to a composite more repre- 
sentative than could be obtained from one woman. Much of 
the material which must be analyzed is of the same intangible 
sort; the utmost care and the highest degree of patience are 
necessary in order that accurate lists may be obtained. 
Duty analysis and difficulty analysis.— Not only may an 
analysis of duties be made, but in addition an analysis of diffi- 
culties can be carried out, which frequently adds to the list 
items which might otherwise be missed. For instance, when a 
small group of teachers were asked to name their duties as class- 
room teachers, a list of twenty items was secured; and then, 
when they were asked what difficulties they met in teaching, 
fifteen additional items were discovered. Theoretically the diffi- 
culties will be identical with the duties when every duty pre- 
   
-P-A-G-E-48
      
  40 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
sents a difficulty, but the critical task in a job analysis of this 
sort is to induce the person being interviewed to recall duties 
which he has been performing more or less unconsciously; and 
in this process of extraction the duties with which he has had 
difficulty will stand out more clearly because of the amount of 
attention they have claimed from him. When he is asked to 
recall these as duties, he is not so likely to think of them as when 
they come to the surface of his memory in the guise of difficulties. 
Errors and use.— The same distinction is found in infor- 
mational material when a contrast is drawn between analysis 
of errors and analysis of use. For instance, if we attempt to 
determine what the course of study in grammar should be when 
based upon use, we can get better results by collecting the observed 
errors in grammar as a starting-point and then determining what 
grammar will be necessary to correct these errors, than we can 
by deciding what laws of grammar are used in practical speech. 
Not only can we get more leads, but in addition, in this particular 
case, we get all the leads we need, since the grammatical rules 
which are followed and not broken do not need to be called to 
the attention of the student. 
Summary. — In determining the activities upon which in- 
struction is to be given, analysis is necessary. This may be done 
by the use of job analysis in certain types of situation, or by 
setting up control elements in informational analysis. Difficulty 
analysis indicates the duties and information upon which special 
emphasis must be laid in the curriculum. Without such analysis 
we are entirely at a loss to know how to proceed in building the 
curriculum.

THE DETERMINATION OF MAJOR OBJECTIVES 
§1—IntTRODUCTION 
Emphasis, not definition. — No writer on the aims of edu- 
cation is able, or has been able, to encompass the totality of the 
aim of education in a single phrase. There is no one statement 
into which the full range of ideals and desires of the human 
mind can be compressed. Morality, the most frequently men- 
tioned of all aims, does not express this totality, for health and 
beauty are also important and have elements of significance 
which are neither moral nor immoral. Social efficiency, our most 
recent aim, offers no provision for the performance by the in- 
dividual of acts which have no social significance. 
In all statements of aim the emphasis has been placed upon 
~ one ideal or more, and the others have been relegated to a second- 
ary position or have been ignored entirely. Certain aims, as for 
instance, physical health, have for centuries been included in many 
statements. And from time to time such aims as morality and 
love of the beautiful have been made subordinate to social - 
efficiency, as when it-is asserted that to be socially efficient one 
needs to be moral, healthy, and beauty-loving. Writers in each 
generation have seemed to think it necessary to stress one aim 
or another, sometimes because the tendency of the day favored 
that special aim, and at other times because the age appeared 
to be so lacking in the spirit of a certain aim that it became 
desirable to stress it.- 
An historical definition.— In such a treatise as Monroe’s 
History of Education it is to be observed that this group of 
aims, of which one or another has been exalted to a position of 
highest importance by writers during the last score of centuries, 
41 
   
-P-A-G-E-50
i i ik aac hh i i a a a 
  42 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
is comparatively seashell not more than eight in number: 
practical efficiency, morality, piety, learning, obedience, individual 
development, social efficiency, and mental discipline. These, 
with their modifications arising from the peculiarity of the indi- 
vidual writer or from the peculiarities of his age, constitute the 
more important of the group of major aims and objectives which 
have been given positions of commanding importance; and, as 
has been said, any writer who selects one of these would assert— 
if the question were put to him directly, that in so far as the others 
are of importance their significance is due to their subordinate 
relationship to the one which he has selected as his premier aim. 
The aim of the present age. — Whether this group which the 
history of education has separated for us into its constituent 
items is or is not sufficiently inclusive cannot be decided by history 
alone, for some of the objectives of the past, such as the mis- 
treatment of the body by the ascetics, clearly do not represent 
ideals which the race to-day considers to be of value. Rather 
do we need to examine into the spirit of our own age and try 
to discover, by analysis of ideals and of activities constituting 
conduct, what are the ideals which we consider important. We 
are living a life to-day whose fundamental objectives are in many 
respects identical with those of past generations. Morality and 
the intelligent rearing of children concern us now as always. 
Emotions and instincts have to be inhibited and guided, but 
probably not more so than in any century in the past. Yet the 
activities in which moral acts are clothed, the behavior of children 
of this generation, and the conduct which controls the emotions, 
differ quite significantly from those of any age which has pre- 
ceded this. It therefore becomes necessary for every generation 
to take stock of its ideals and of the activities of its people, to 
the end that the young may live the life which will prepare 
them best for participation in the work and play of the world. 
Building the future on the present. — The best of this gener- 
ation must be taught to the next, even though we recognize 
that the ideals and activities of the next generation will differ 
in part from those of our own. The weight and importance of
-P-A-G-E-51
  DETERMINATION OF MAJOR OBJECTIVES 43 
social ideals shift with comparative slowness, and the changes 
can be taken care of if to instruction in the activities and ideals 
of our generation is added training in methods, of clear thinking. 
With the ability to think their problems through for themselves 
we can trust the new generation to face their own problems with 
their feet solidly placed upon the structure of the past. If the 
new generation is sufficiently trained in methods of intelligent 
thinking upon practical problems, it cannot fail to develop new 
solutions to meet new situations. 
Varieties of objectives. — The variations in objectives may 
be caused by variations of ideals or by variations of activities. 
'The-moral aim of education is one in which one ideal, that of 
morality, is selected from many other ideals and emphasized. 
The esthetic aim, which seeks\te develop love of beauty, is one 
which is obtained by emphasizing that ideal over others. 
Through emphasizing different activities we get different 
kinds of schools; for instance, vocational schools, in which the 
activities of the vocation are given primary attention. This 
emphasis also produces medical schools, engineering schools, 
colleges, and a wide range of professional institutions. The dif- 
ference between women’s education and that of men is less a 
contrast of ideals than of activities for which the training is to 
be given. 
This change in emphasis, which we find running through the 
history of the evolution of educational aims, pointedly raises the 
question of methods of determining objectives. Is it possible to 
determine scientifically the major objectives of this generation, 
and if it is possible, is it advisable to have a national set of major 
objectives? This leads to a consideration of the method of deter- 
mining the objectives- 
§2—Derrterminine IpHALs 
Determining the ideals. — As has been seen, ideals are fluid 
and cannot be scientifically evaluated. Consequently, the one 
thing that can be done is to have either an individual decision
-P-A-G-E-52
    44 S nenan CONSTRUCTION 
or a faculty seuiettit concerning the ideals which are to dominate 
in each specific situation. The individual teacher may accept 
or decide, either consciously or unconsciously, what seem to him 
to be the important ideals which shall dominate in the instruction 
which he gives to his students. This is the normal situation in 
the schools to-day. To each teacher is left the decision as to what 
ideals, if any, he will emphasize. If he happens to be a man of 
strong feelings he may have a very effective influence upon the 
molding of the ideals of his students. If, on the other hand, 
he is of a neutral personality, his students may not be affected 
by contacts with him. 
Ideals, however, are found to be a matter of group consensus 
in such cases as those where we speak of the spirit of a school, 
or of the outstanding characteristics of the graduates. Students 
in one institution may have a different set of ideals from those 
in another, which in a conscious or unconscious way have been 
developed during their four years of college life. This is the 
result of the influence of. an individual instructor, of faculty 
consensus concerning ideals, or of the ideals of the student body. 
Perhaps it is most often a combination of all three; and as to 
which is the dominating force it is difficult to say. Sometimes 
the administration has ideals of such strength that it selects 
faculties which will carry out its ideals, and the administration 
and the faculty mold the student body. At other times the 
student body has its own ideals, and the faculty has comparatively 
little influence upon it. 
It is quite clear to the writer that it is not necessary to leave 
the emphasis of ideals to chance. There is every reason why a 
faculty should decide for itself what will be the dominant ideals 
of the institution, after taking into account the individuality of 
the students and of the members of the faculty. 
Three methods.— There are three methods of arriving at 
the ideals which dominate instruction in any subject matter. 
The first of these is listing the activities and determining which 
ideals are the most efficient in carrying out the duties. Fo return

On the left-hand side are the duties, and on the right the 
personal qualifications which are thought to be necessary in 
carrying out these duties effectively. For instance, when the appli- 
cation clerk meets people who desire to open accounts, it is very 
important that the ideal of friendliness should dominate his 
actions. If his acting be controlled instead by indifference or surli- 
ness, they will differ radically from those performed under the 
ideal of friendliness, and will be quite inefficient. Similarly, in 
connection with obtaining the information for the application 
blank, the quality of tactfulness is very necessary. 
Qualities or qualifications for the job are ideals for the holder 
of the position. Traits already possessed may be termed qualities; 
when they are not possessed, but are striven for, they are termed 
ideals. The ideals for an application clerk are the qualities neces-   
 
-P-A-G-E-54
    46 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
sary to the efficient performance of his job. So, by this method, 
the activities are first listed, and the dominating ideal is then 
attached to each. 
Faculty action.— A second method of determining the re- 
lationship between ideals and activities in any training school 
is for the faculty to choose the ideals by consensus and then 
select the activities with which to connect them. For instance, 
in a faculty of thirty people connected with a women’s college, 
it was decided that the following ideals should dominate the in- 
struction given to the students: love of beauty, health, service, 
forcefulness, discipline, honesty, courtesy, scholarliness, cheerful- 
ness, and spirituality. Then, when these ideals had been decided 
upon, each instructor took upon himself the task of deciding 
upon the activities connected with his own class to which each 
of these ideals should be particularly applied, and the dean of 
women and the dormitory staff likewise drew up a list of extra- 
curricular activities which should be governed by each of the 
ideals selected by the faculty for emphasis. 
The difference between this method and the preceding one 
should be clearly noted. In the one case, the activities are first 
determined, and then the ideals which dominate each are selected. 
In the other case the ideals are determined first, and then from 
the activities carried on by the students those are selected to 
which the determined ideals should particularly apply. 
Individual character analysis. — In the selection of ideals by 
the faculty an interesting method can be used which is particu- 
larly applicable to the elementary school. The difficulty in de- 
termining the ideals to be emphasized in each grade lies in the fact: 
that it is almost impossible to obtain an accurate statement from 
teachers. If, for instance, we ask them what ideals should domi- 
nate, they are unable to recall all the ideals that might be em- 
phasized, and might not even have a very clear idea of the exact 
nature of the problem which they are trying to solve. To meet 
this difficulty the following device can be used with considerable 
success. A list of ideals may be prepared, of sufficient breadth to 
‘ cover all those ordinarily accepted by people as being of impor-
-P-A-G-E-55
  
DETERMINATION OF MAJOR OBJECTIVES 47 
tance. Then submit this list to the teachers of the public school 
system, and ask each teacher to think of one pupil and decide 
which of the ideals needs to be stressed with him. Then, when 
this has been checked, the task may be continued until the ideals 
which need to be stressed for all the pupils in the grades have 
been indicated. When this has been done we can obtain through 
frequency of mention some indication as to which ideals, in the 
opinion of teachers, need to be stressed in the first grade, in the 
second, in the third, and so on for all grades. 
In this study the points that need particular attention are 
the preparation of the original list of ideals and the exercise of 
careful judgment by the teachers as they check. : 
Desired qualities versus emphasized qualities. — The query 
may be raised as to whether the ideals to be stressed in a school 
are identical with those which it is desirable for its ‘graduates 
to have. When a faculty is asked to indicate the ideals which 
| graduates should possess when they leave school, is it influenced 
by remembering the ideals which need to be stressed in the 
instruction of the students whom they know? Can they distin- 
guish between the qualities needing to be stressed and the qualities 
which it is desirable for people to have? The difference between 
the two alternatives lies in the possibility that some children 
may have ideals so strongly developed that they do not need to 
be stressed. For instance, the well-bred child may be quite 
obedient, while children with different home training may need 
to be taught obedience above all other ideals. 
To throw light upon this point, a study has been made in 
which a faculty was asked to give two lists, one of the desirable 
qualities which college women should possess, and another of 
the ideals which should be stressed in a woman’s college. Among 
the ten ideals receiving the highest mention in each list, there 
was a difference in only one case. In other words, for practical 
purposes, the ideals which this group of teachers marked as being 
desirable are identical with those which they considered most 
necessary for emphasis.

  CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
  §3—Typrs or OBJECTIVES ) 
Vocational objectives. — As regards major objectives there 
are two important types to be analyzed: vocational and non- 
vocational. 
At present we have two types of institutions of higher learn- 
ing, the vocational school. and the cultural or academic school. 
In the first of these, instruction is given in the subject matter 
pertaining to learning a vocation. In the second, attention is 
only secondarily paid to vocation, while primary emphasis is 
placed upon the kind of training which a person is supposed to 
have irrespective of his vocation. The tendency in the vocational 
type of school is to lay comparatively little stress upon the type 
of information found in the ‘‘cultural’’ school, in whose course 
of study the vocation is not directly included. These facts lead 
to constant controversy between the supporters of the two types 
of schools, as to which constitutes the better type of education, 
and as to the real definition and nature of culture. 
Extra-vocational objectives. — But it is admitted by all that 
the man who follows a vocation has in addition as a citizen of 
community and nation, many extra-vocational interests and 
activities: esthetic interests not connected with his vocation; 
social relations independent of what he does to earn his living; 
intellectual interests; and physical recreations which need have 
nothing to do with his profession. It follows that when a voca- 
tional school determines its objectives and from them derives 
its curriculum, two types of major objectives must be taken into 
account, the vocational and the extra-vocational. In the construc- 
tion of the curriculum an analysis needs to be made not only of 
the duties of the vocation but likewise of the interests and 
activities found in extra-vocational life. The material derived 
from the first constitutes the vocational part of the vocational 
curriculum, and the material derived from an analysis of the 
extra-vocational activities would constitute the cultural part of 
the vocational curriculum. i 
; 
—hb
-P-A-G-E-57
DETERMINATION OF MAJOR OBJECTIVES 49 
This implies that the cultural elements of the vocational 
curriculum are those relating to the individual’s life and his in- 
terests irrespective of his vocation. As to whether or not such 
material should be strongly tinged with esthetic ideals is a 
question, and perhaps the term ‘‘cultural” is not entirely satis- 
factory for the material described. But whatever the term, it is 
an essential principle of curriculum construction that all profes- 
sional or vocational curricula designed to prepare for earning a 
living must include also an extra-vocational core which will be 
mastered by all people regardless of the vocation which they 
follow. The extra-vocational material for a school of engineering 
will be essentially the same as that for a school of law or a school 
of medicine; obtained by an analysis of extra-vocational life, it 
will deal with the problems which people meet no matter what 
vocation they may choose. That.these problems are not only 
political and social, but also esthetic, intellectual, and physical, 
makes it all the more necessary that such a core should be deter- 
mined for all vocations. 
The “cultural” core of a vocational curriculum. — This pre- 
sents a constructive program for the determination of the extra- 
vocational content of vocational curricula, and is contrasted 
with the usual negative attitude of those who make up vocational 
curricula in that the latter know definitely what should be in- 
eluded in the vocational elements but are very much in doubt 
as to what should be included in the extra-vocational. Conse- 
quently we encounter heated arguments as to whether the extra 
hours not used in the vocation should be filled with such extra- 
vocational subjects as foreign languages, history, English, or 
sociolegy. In the absence of definite methods for prescribing 
the extra-vocational material the tendency is always to fall back 
upon those traditional subjects which appeal to any particular 
faculty. The difficulty is very well illustrated by the inquiry 
from a professional faculty as follows: ‘We have arranged for 
all our professional curriculum except nine hours, which we have 
left for cultural subjects, and we should like to know what these 
should be.” In this case consensus of opinion was used. But it 
   
-P-A-G-E-58
  50 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
is generally much better to analyze extra-vocational activities, 
and make eventual selection on the ground not of how many or 
how few hours a subject will require, but rather of how essential 
it will be in the students’ extra-vocational life. 
§4—CurrRENT STUDIES 
Studies. — One of the most interesting studies that has been 
made in the analysis of vocational objectives is that of Strong 
(p. 292) at Carnegie Institute of Technology assisted by com- 
mittees of the faculty. As is described in the second part of the 
text (p. 292) it was decided that certain units in the institution 
should be utilized in the training of executives for building and 
construction firms and for production and printing plants. With 
the field of the graduates so defined, it then followed naturally 
that a job analysis should be made of the positions of executives 
in concerns of these three kinds. Ultimately the executive positions 
in forty concerns were analyzed and their duties listed. These 
duties were classified into large groups corresponding in a general 
way to the different types of subjects which might be taught, 
and these groups, under committee action, were worked out in 
considerable detail. 
Job analysis revealed the duties, but no particular attention 
was paid to the qualifications which were necessary, or the ideals 
which should dominate in the performance of the duties (though 
in a few cases such qualifications were collected as were consid- 
ered important-by the executives interviewed). In this respect 
the study was incomplete, since neither by analysis nor by faculty 
consensus were the dominating ideals decided upon. 
A second study is that made by Jones (p. 334) as Chairman of 
a committee of the college teachers of education. In this case 
it appears that the analysis was produced in conference with a 
number of teachers in the neighborhood of Philadelphia, and 
from this source a list of 170 items was obtained. Then, to obtain 
frequency, the total list was presented to a large number of 
teachers to check. An examination of the list suggests two short-
-P-A-G-E-59
  DETERMINATION OF MAJOR OBJECTIVES 51 
- comings: that some important duties were not mentioned at all 
in its compilation, and that many of those mentioned were 
made too general to elicit definite replies. 
A third study is that being made of the organization of 
women’s education in Stephens College (p. 328). In this study the 
faculty decided upon the ideals through consensus of opinion, 
and the ten selected were to be so stressed in the curriculum 
that every student should, during her four years, be given ade- 
quate appreciation of their value and control of their use. 
This analysis of the activities of women is an extensive rather 
than intensive study. The diary method has been used, to obtain 
a record of what women do and think about during the day. 
Each of a large number of women kept for a week a diary as 
intensive as possible, then, by throwing all the diaries together, 
a cumulative picture was obtained of the women’s activities. 
There has also been made a long check-list of all sorts of activities 
discovered both in the diaries and outside, and this was submitted 
to a large number of college women, who were asked to indicate 
the presence or absence of these interests in their lives. 
However, not enough studies have been made to explore 
adequately the field of the analysis of major objectives and more 
such studies must undoubtedly follow as their technique is 
better understood. 
Scant attention to major objectives. — The reason that so 
little attention is paid to the major objectives is that they are 
so difficult to determine, and so relatively indefinite in content, 
that the time of attack must necessarily be delayed until an 
adequate body of data as to method has been obtained under 
less difficult conditions in the study of similar problems in the 
field. The situation, therefore, results in a series of pioneer 
studies which are of interest rather because of the methods 
utilized than because of the content of the curriculum. 
Recent investigations. — In selecting problems for study of 
the curriculum the investigators have been concerned for the 
most part with the subjects of the course of study, such as spelling, 
mathematics, and English, rather than with the major functions  
-P-A-G-E-60
  52 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
of the curriculum. This is partly because the subjects have been 
under continuous and general attack due to alleged weaknesses 
in content, and partly because criticism of the curriculum has 
been conducted in terms of the subjects, the claim being made 
that certain elements of a subject should be omitted and certain 
other elements added. Consequently the investigators have been 
interested in studying the subjects, to see to what extent the 
traditional content of any one would be modified if certain func- 
tions of the subject were accepted. They have assumed that 
these subjects were of such importance that they will always be 
retained in the course of study, no matter what the analysis of 
major objectives may develop. 
One may challenge the validity of this assumption, of course, 
but equally one must realize that such an assumption exists, if 
one is to get a clear understanding of the significance of the 
studies reported upon in the text. In all of these, with the ex- 
ceptions noted, the determination and analysis of major objectives 
are left open. The subjects, as at present named and delimited, 
are accepted as units in the course of study, and attempts are 
made in the investigation to determine the amount and nature 
of the modifications which arise when certain functions of these 
subjects are accepted. 
Objectives. — Statements of objectives of education and 
of subjects of the curriculum lead to confusion unless they 
are analyzed into ideal objectives and activity objectives. Social 
efficiency as an objective becomes easily analyzed if we see that 
it means social ideals and social activities. Social ideals are deter- 
mined by one method, social activities by another. Good citizen- 
ship must likewise be analyzed into the ideals of the good citizen 
and the activities of the good citizen. A curriculum in moral 
education requires the ¢deal .of morality on the one hand, and a 
list of moral actions on the other. Good health, in a similar 
manner, is differentiated into certain ideals and certain actions 
or habits, hygienic rules, and information. Once the analysis of 
objectives into ideal objectives and activity objectives has been 
made, the process of deriving the curriculum presents no serious
-P-A-G-E-61
  DETERMINATION OF MAJOR OBJECTIVES 53 
difficulty. But if the investigator confuses the two, and at one 
time talks of ideals and at another of activities, without sensing 
the difference, his efforts will not carry him through to a curricu- 
lum. He will remain in the field of theory. 
An analysis chart. — In order to clarify the relations between 
. ideals and activities the familiar form of the graph can be used. 
' What is needed in order to derive the curriculum from objectives 
is, as we have seen, an analysis of ideals so as to make them easy 
to handle, and an analysis of activities to the level where they 
also may be handled efficiently. For instance, in the case of 
Herbart’s objective we may say that the individual should lead 
a life ‘‘which is ethical.’”’ In this there are obviously two elements, 
ethical ideals and living a life. In living a life the individual 
performs series and groups of activities which are controlled by 
ethical ideals. It is necessary, then, to analyze ethical ideals on 
the one hand into such items as honesty, sympathy, etc., and 
similarly to analyze the activities involved in living a life. ~~ 
The resulting situation may be represented by a graph, along 
the top of which are run the ideals, while along the side are listed 
the activities, and in the squares are checked the ideals which 
dominate the performance of each activity. In the following 
chart the ethical idgals are analyzed into five classes, let us say, 
indicated by the figures from one to five. Other classes and sub- 
classes of ideals extend to the right. The group of activities (A) 
is analyzed and sub-classified as shown on the left. The checks

indicate that in performing activity A 1 (1) (a) i, the ethical ideals 
1 and 3 dominate, while in performing activity A 1 (1) (a) ii, 
the ethical ideals marked 1 and 2 and the social ideal, 1, control. 
Considering the vertical column it will be found that an ideal 
along the top adheres to the many activities along the side. A 
housewife might conceivably seek to perform many actions in 
conformity with the ideal of neatness. She might, for instance, 
wish to be neat in dressing in the morning, in preparing break- 
fast, in mixing a mash for the chickens, in clearing the table, in 
making beds, etc. Or, if we consider an activity along the side, 
it may happen that one of these will be dominated by a number 
of ideals, not only ethical, but social, esthetic, etc. In serving 
breakfast, for instance, the housewife may be dominated by the 
ideals of neatness, health, and sociability. Viewed from either top 
or side we may either teach ideals through activities, or teach 
activities under the. domination of ideals, depending upon our 
philosophy of life. 
The effect of adding other ideals is merely to increase the 
width of the graph. The activities do not change. They are deter- 
mined by an analysis of the physical and mental experiences of 
the individual. This widening of the range of ideals would merely 
result in the control of the activity by more ideals. In that 
case instead of the person’s merely attempting to turn out 
an honest piece of work, he might also attempt to make it beauti- 
ful and perform it as a service to humanity. 
The public ee — In the reorganization of the 
course of study in the elementary schools we have now considered 
three points. (“We must, first of all, determine the-size of the 
unit fe i rriculum is to be organized. This unit may 
be the individual school, as in the-ease-of-a-private-school or an 
institution of higher learning. It may be a city system of schools; 
possibly the unit might be considered to be the state, and con- 
ceivably it might be a national unit: In deciding upon the size 
of the unit, due regard must be had to the complexities of the 
situation. The probabilities are that our nation is a unit too large 
for any sort of coherent similarity. The school system of the
-P-A-G-E-63
  DETERMINATION OF MAJOR’ OBJECTIVES 55 
state is more nearly workable because it is possible to get the 
teachers together. The city system, because of its geographic 
compactness, would be a desirable unit. 
But in any case, after the unit has been selected, it is neces- 
Y sary, in the second place, for the faculties of the schools, the 
school boards, and public-spirited citizens generally, to decide

be made of the important activities of laymen, irrespective of 
the vocation which they may enter; this involves making an extra- 
eae a determining after the analysis 
the essential elements of learning common to all vocations. 
In collecting material for a course of study for vocational 
schools we have thus covered three steps. The dominant ideals 
must first be decided upon by interested parties such as the 
faculty, the board, and the students, if mature enough. In the 
second place, a job analysis must be made of the vocation. And 
in the third place, an analysis must be made of extra-vocational 
life in order to determine what the extra-vocational elements of 
the curriculum should be. 
Summary. — In this chapter we have sought to show the place 
of ideals and activities in relation to the major objectives of edu- 
cation. We have shown the work which analysis has to perform 
in picking these objectives and deriving from them the topics 
for the curriculum. In the succeeding chapter we shall examine 
the elements of the analysis, and the determination of the rela- 
tive importance of materials to be used in the practical curricu- 
lum of the school. 
 
-P-A-G-E-64
  Cuapter VI 
THE LIMITS OF ANALYSIS 
The limits to which an analysis should be carried are de- 
termined by the working units of human accomplishment. 
The mental stride. — Man has a mental stride with which 
he marches from one goal of civilization to another. We are 
familiar with his physical stride; the male adult normally steps 
about thirty inches, with some variation. Outside of the realm 
of magic carpets and seven-league boots there is no way of greatly 
increasing the length of his step beyond this, because the stride 
is determined by the length of the human leg. The Mohammedan 
pilgrim, when he sets out for Mecca, knows that he must travel 
by paces thirty inches long and that only by adding one step to 
another can he reach his goal. Not for him is it sufficient to know 
merely that he must arrive at the tomb of the Prophet. If he 
is to reach his religious objective he must translate the Holy City 
into a general direction plus careful attention to each of the inter- 
vening paces. 
Units of achievement. — In a manner exactly analogous the 
human mind has a mental stride by which it has come up from 
savagery to civilization. It has used small working units whose 
size is determined by the structure of the human mind. It has 
grown from savagery to civilization, and is growing from infancy 
to maturity, by units of achievement whose sizes are determined 
by mental ability. There is no way of rubbing a ring and sum- 
moning a genie to help us cross the gap from one achievement to 
another. Even in such a small matter as the attaining of neatness 
in the home the objective is reached only by little steps. One’s 
clothes must be picked up in the morning and put away in the 
evening. The hair must be combed; the coat must be brushed 
and the clothes pressed; the pencils must be placed in a row; the 
56
-P-A-G-E-65
THE LIMITS OF ANALYSIS 57 ' 
ashes shaken into the tray. It is entirely futile to expect neat- 
ness to come merely at the call of deep desire. The task of ac- 
complishing ideals and of performing activities is so large that it 
is absolutely necessary for them to be broken down into working 
units of the size of human ability, so that these may be mastered 
one by one. 
Every teacher who instructs children in such a way as to see 
his teaching influence conduct knows that this is the only way to 
reach objectives. It is only those who write and do not teach who 
say that it is sufficient to set up the final objective, and that 
by some divine alchemy, some hit-or-miss endeavor, the end will 
be attained. Exhortation will not produce correct speech; the 
errors must be mastered one by one. In spelling, the field is 
covered by teaching word after word. Geography and history 
are acquired fact by fact, and grammar, definition by definition. 
Skill in addition clearly is obtained only by the mastery of the 
forty-five combinations, and skill in reasoning is secured only by 
considering simple problems first and proceeding to more complex 
ones later. A moral life is the cumulation of a great mass of single 
moral acts, and social service results from the performance of 
specific social duties. 
Zones. — In stating that working units of achievement lie at 
the lower limits of analysis, we have for clarity avoided discussion 
of individual differences in the size of these units. Within limits 
differences exist. Just as the physical pace of the infant toddler 
is less than twelve inches in length, while some very tall adults 
normally step a yard, so the mental stride of the little child is 
shorter than the pace of the adult who has grown in mental stat- 
ure. Whereas the novice takes but a small pace in his field, the 
initiate proceeds with giant paces when working under normal 
conditions. 
There is no geometric point at which analysis ends. Working 
units fall into zones whose breadth depends upon the ability and 
experience of the individual who is to be instructed. For instance, 
when, during the War, the Federal Government advocated the 
- canning of tomatoes by the cold-pack method, for some women 
 
-P-A-G-E-66
  58 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
no further information was necessary. Stimulated by the pa- 
triotic appeal to can tomatoes they were able to do so at once 
because they had the experience and knew how to use that method. 
But other women, who accepted this objective and desired to 
conserve food, did not know how to can by the cold-pack method 
and for them a job analysis was necessary. They were told that 
the steps in performing this operation consisted of: collecting 
canning utensils, cleansing them, testing jars, rings, and lids, 
grading the tomatoes, scalding them, etc. These directions 
were stated in sufficient detail for a part of the women, who pos- 
sessed some experience but less in amount than the group first 
mentioned. 
It was found, however, that the demonstrators in their canning 
campaigns had to make a supplementary job analysis of each of 
the foregoing items so as to break them up into smaller steps in 
order to reach the working units of many practical housewives. 
For instance, instead of saying merely, “Collect canning utensils 
and cleanse them,” the demonstrators found it necessary to give 
these steps: ‘Secure a well screened, light, airy room, protected 
from dust and drafts, containing a good stove, a supply of good 
fresh water, a table, dish-pan, kettle with a lid, tea-kettle, paring 
knife, a sack of salt, teaspoon, tablespoon, and a supply of glass 
jars. Wash the hands thoroughly, clean the fingernails, don a 
clean apron and cap, ete.” 
This analysis of duties was found to be sufficient for even the 
least experienced cooks; but, if the same process were by any 
chance to be taught to little children, some of these steps would 
need to be analyzed again. For instance, the methods of wash- 
ing the hands thoroughly would need to be analyzed for little 
children. It may be stated parenthetically that this is one of 
the operations which has to be taught to young medical students, 
who have long since passed the age of infancy. 
The working units into which material has to be broken are 
dependent upon the learner rather than upon the subject. matter. 
If he is young and immature, the steps into which the material 
has to be broken must be smaller, whereas if he has greater ma- 
 
-P-A-G-E-67
THE LIMITS OF ANALYSIS 59 
turity detailed explanations are not so necessary. Similarly the 
limits of analysis of objectives are dependent upon the ability 
of the learner rather than upon the nature of the objectives. 
Morality is morality, but the directions given to little children 
about how to be moral are much more definite than those which 
are given to adults, because the adult has already learned the 
little things which the child has not, and is able to perform a greater 
task. 
But in making this statement we must avoid the common 
danger of failing to carry analysis far enough even for adults. 
A principle of conduct will not be accepted unless it is supple- 
mented by many illustrations which are expressed in terms of 
the experience of the learner. The great principles of the New 
Testament have carried over with especial success largely because 
of the parables and specific illustrations which show the followers 
of Christianity how to apply the principles to tasks which are 
quite within their experience. 
Spencer’s analysis.— Spencer realized that analysis was 
needed when he defined complete living as consisting of self- 
preservation, the earning of a living, parenthood, citizenship, 
and “culture.” From that point he proceeded at once to show 
to his own satisfaction that the sciences could provide the whole 
curriculum, and he specified physiology, chemistry, physics, 
mathematics, biology, esthetics, astronomy, history, and the 
science of society. But his analysis did not proceed far enough 
to enable him to determine what facts in each of these sciences 
should be selected. What he should have done in order to accom- 
plish this, if he had desired to do so, was to analyze each of the 
five groups of activities mentioned down to the limits of work- 
ing units. 
He should, for instance, have asked what are’ the actions which 
good citizens perform, and finding them, he should have taken 
up the supplementary analysis of each until, step by step, he had 
reached the zone of working units of those to be instructed. Good 
citizenship, he might have said, consists of many elements, one 
of which is the paying of taxes promptly, and another the intel-     
 
-P-A-G-E-68
  60 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
I 
ligent voting for city officers. The first duty, that of paying taxes 
promptly, would not need to be analyzed if the student knew 
how to pay them promptly, but if he did not it would be neces- 
sary to continue the analysis and divide the paying of taxes into 
methods of ascertaining the amount, learning the place of pay- 
ment, the days upon which they should be paid, ete. When this 
has been carried to sufficient detail to meet the capacities of the 
student, then all that is left to be done is to state how to per- 
form each of the duties finally arrived at. In a similar way 
voting intelligently for city officials would need to be analyzed 
until the idea had been carried down to the point where those to 
be instructed could follow the directions without. assistance. 
When this had been done for all his five activities he would then 
have known what sciences and what specific items of each science 
were necessary for complete living. 
The perfect analysis. — The perfect analysis is one which is 
carried to the point where the student can learn without assist- 
ance. If it is put into the form of a book, the ideal text is one 
which teaches itself. In it the material is so expertly presented 
that the student understands everything, can follow it through to its 
end, incorporate it in his experience, and use it in his life of action. 
Approximations. — Theoretically, this would mean a different 
curriculum for every learner, since each student has capacities 
different from those of every other student, and to meet these a 
curriculum would need to be carried to different levels of working 
units. But since this is obviousiy impracticable two approxi- 
mations are made. The first is secured by the use of a “general 
level.” With this in mind the curriculum is constructed for 
grades, and as a result we have primary texts, intermediate 
books, and high school and college curricula. In. each case the 
author more or less arbitrarily sets up an assumed standard of 
what—in general—are the capacities of the students at the level 
for which he writes. In writing for this group he endeavors to 
strike an average and make a compilation which is neither too 
easy nor too difficult. By careful attention to these matters he 
hopes to construct a book which will largely teach itself.

  THE LIMITS OF ANALYSIS 61 
But in case it does not teach itself completely he has recourse 
to the second method of approximation. The teacher out of 
his scholarship, on the one hand, and his knowledge of the work- 
ing units of the student, on the other, will help to translate into 
terms of the experience of the students what the writer fails 
clearly to present. In other words, the teacher takes the analysis 
which the author has made, carries it beyond the point to which 
the author carried it, and bridges the gap between the limits 
of the author’s analysis and the student’s ability. 
Under ideal conditions, as has been stated, there should be no 
necessity for work of this sort by the teacher; but unfortunately 
the determining of the level of experience is so difficult for those 
who at present prepare curricula and texts, and the differences 
in the abilities of students in the same class are so marked, that 
the teacher is compelled to devote broad scholarship and pro- 
found pedagogic thought to the task of bringing the curriculum 
down to the level of the working units of the class. 
Authorship. — In the absence of these ideal conditions three 
methods are possible. In the first place the curricula and text- 
books for any grade might be prepared by teachers of that grade. 
In this case the difficulty lies with the teachers, who are frequently 
not sufficiently scholarly or expert to satisfy the demands of ac- 
curacy in formulating new material or in reorganizing old. 
A second possibility is for the scholar who contemplates 
writing a textbook to teach the material to the grade of 
students for whom it is to be prepared. The disadvantage in 
this arises from the fact that scholars are unwilling to go to this 
trouble, or do not have the facilities to do it. But it must be 
definitely urged that any person who, unaided, attempts to write 
textbooks for any grade of the elementary school or the high 
school should not do so unless he has had actual teaching expe- 
rience with the grade of students for whom he attempts to write. 
The third method of approximation to ideal conditions is 
joint authorship. In this case the scholar in the combination 
guarantees the accuracy of the subject matter, and the teacher 
of the grade who coéperates with him in preparing the material

will provide the pedagogic adaptations. For many reasons this 
method is not so satisfactory as is either of the others, but it is 
more readily carried out and has more advantages than dis- 
advantages. 
Current studies. — Some of the studies that have been made 
have reduced their material to working units. The spelling vo- 
cabulary is derived from children’s themes and composed of 
words already used by children and is, therefore, theoretically 
within the zone of working units. Sometimes these words are 
listed by grades, which makes the list still more certain of practical 
usefulness. Such lists come close to teaching themselves. Sim- 
ilarly the lists derived from adults’ correspondence are all within 
the ability of high school students. Particularly, Greene (p. 287) 
taught his material on sheep husbandry to ninth-grade boys for 
the explicit purpose of testing his attempt to reduce his material 
to the level of the students, and found that with few exceptions 
his material was quite intelligible. Most of the other studies are, 
however, not concerned with any analysis beyond the first step. 
Miss Camerer’s material would hardly teach itself to high school 
students. Horn, Bassett, Bagley, Wilson, Monroe, and many 
others list topics which demand further analysis, but they can be 
defended by the fact that analysis to the level of working units 
was not part of their problems.

§1—Tue ProBLem 
The reason for selection. — Because the units of achievement 
which are available for instruction are so numerous that even if 
progress ceased no one person could hope to learn them all in a 
millennium, it is necessary to select_the units which shall be in- 
cluded in that roll of honor and usefulness which constitutes the 
curriculum of the schools. So great is the importance that thus 
attaches to the chosen items of the course of study that the selec- 
tion must be made with extreme bg Those vested interests, 
the traditional subjects with their cOnventional content, whose 
position is established so strongly in the schools, must be tempo- 
rarily disregarded in the process of reconstruction, until by an- 
alysis of the objectives of this generation it can be determined 
which parts of them should be retained. They may, as at present 
constituted, be the best possible units that could be included in 
the course of study, or they may not. Their retention depends 
upon their usefulness. But certainly they have no greater basic 
right to be included in this Hall of Fame than have some more 
recently discovered products of the human mind. 
Home versus school. — There are three specific conditions 
which make this selection imperative. The first of these is the 
fact that some units are taught better outside the school than 
within its confines. What these are is.the subject of argument, 
but the tendency is to add more and more of them to the school 
course when they seem to be neglected outside of the school. 
To be specific, it is generally agreed in this country that religion 
is not a subject for public school instruction, There is less una-

nimity about personal habits such as the care of the teeth and 
proper food. Practice here seems to depend upon what the 
schools are driven to. As a practical matter, it has become ap- 
parent that the decision as to what should be included must be 
left to the school staff, the school board, and the public, so that 
we may discover which home duties should be included in the 
school curriculum, and the extent to which the school shall with- 
stand that outside pressure which leads to the overcrowding of 
the curriculum. 
The time limit. — The second reason for selection is the exist- 
ence of different time limits. Children have, in most states, to 
attend school until they are fourteen to sixteen years of age or 
until they have finished the first eight grades. This means that 
their school education may cease at the end of the sixth grade, 
or at any time from that up through the twelve grades of the pub- 
lic school, or at any time during the sixteen- to nineteen-year 
period which the doctor’s degree ends. This range in time limit 
forms a problem in selection. Particularly since the majority of 
children have completed their education when they have finished 
the sixth grade, should they be given the minimum essentials of 
the curriculum during those six years, or should eight grades be 
taken as the minimum limit of education? In any case, the limits 
of time make it necessary to determine the relative importance of 
material in the course of study, since if selection must be made 
the least important should be omitted. 
Learning. — Determination of relative importance is neces- 
sary also in the third place because items need attention not only 
- on the basis of their intrinsic importance but also on the basis of 
the relative difficulty of learning them. Some items of very great 
importance can be learned very easily, while on the other hand 
items of relatively less importance may be much more difficult 
of acquisition. Clearly, then, the amount of time which shall 
be spent upon any item is dependent not only upon use but upon 
difficulty, 
 
-P-A-G-E-73
RELATIVE IMPORTANCE 65 
§2—How to Drrermine Rexative Importance 
Use. — Importance is determined in the last analysis by use. 
An electric washer is better than a tub and boiler if it cleanses 
the clothes as well in less time or better in an equal time. Lime is 
a better fertilizer than phosphorus for some soils if it produces 
more corn to the acre. And honesty is preferable to dishonesty 
because its results in terms of human well-being are better. All 
values are in the last analysis determined by the effect they have 
upon desires and needs. SS 
No ultimate aim.— There is no ultimate objective which 
stands out as the measuring stick of all the others. Spencer gives 
self-preservation such a position of final importance, but there 
are times in which the Sacrificing of a man’s life is of less impor- 
tance than the safety of women and children. Yet, in turn, the 
safety of women and children cannot be regarded as the ultimate 
objective of life, since they are saved only because their safety 
is of importance for other objectives. What we really have is a 
great nexus of values bound together, each serving both as means 
and as ends to the others. No one is superior, but all are inferior 
to the welfare of the whole. People may differ as to which of | 
these are of greater value. The advocates of a certain value 
may seek to prove the supremacy of that one; and it often happens 
that such proof is sufficiently convincing for one community or 
one generation. But viewed in the large what appears most clearly 
is that no one is paramount—but rather that a great cluster of 
objectives are mutually interdependent. 
Quantitative results. — In certain fields, however, it is easily 
possible to measure results. For instance: one farmer uses lime; 
thousands of others do not; and a majority vote declares that 
lime is not a satisfactory fertilizer. But when finally we look 
toward results, these show that lime raises more bushels of corn 
per acre—and its superiority is indisputably demonstrated. 
Methods of salesmanship can be measured in terms of dollars, 
and machines in terms of output. Close attention to business 
may be proved superior to laziness by contrasting the sizes of 
 
-P-A-G-E-74
      
66 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
the institutions employing these two principles. In all fields 
where quantitative measures may be definitely applied, values 
are easily determined. 
The verdict of history. — The vast majority of our values, 
however, cannot be so exactly measured. In the field of politics 
there is no such measurement for immediate use. Shall we con- 
sider peace as better than war? Is high tariff superior to free 
trade? Shall we mingle with others or remain in isolation? Is 
government ownership preferable to private ownership? 
There is no political micrometer to measure the answers in 
fractional terms. Frankly, we do not know. Certain individuals 
may think they know, but certain others hold opposite views, 
so that the correct answer hangs in suspense, perhaps forever. 
Frequently the answer cannot be given until history passes its 
tardy verdict, which is determined by results, and even then 
is only more or less accurately determined. 
Consensus. — To meet a situation of this sort democracies 
have hit upon the device of the majority rule, and have agreed 
that so far as civic conduct is concerned that policy is considered 
better which can muster a majority. In the absence of absolute 
measurement, consensus determines superiority. 
But even in this case we find that the minority may hold 
that the judgment so determined is wrong. They may attempt 
to defend this by appeal to results which will appear in the future. 
“Tn future years,” they say, “the minority will be shown to have 
been correct in this contention, when results of a distressing 
nature follow from the majority action.’”’ The majority on the 
other hand make the same appeal to results. Both minority and 
majority recognize the fact that consensus is not the final arbiter. 
They merely accept it as a convenient method of decision until 
the results shall have been evaluated before the final tribunal 
of history. 
Expert opinion. — In certain cases it is found to be more| 
reliable to substitute expert consensus for common opinion, 
Even in the political affairs of democracy some selections o 
men and decisions of fact are left to expert opinion without r

course to popular review. In questions of law there is no 
immediate popular recourse from the decisions of the Supreme 
Court. The relative value of technical points is frequently left 
to the opinion of groups of experts selected because of their 
special training and experience. Even in matters upon which 
the final decision is made by popular consent the opinions of ex- 
perts have weight, especially when such opinions are quite or 
almost unanimous. 
In fields other than political, expert opinion is wisely used. 
The ranking of poets is not determined by the votes of the major- 
ity of people. The most popular music is not always the best 
music; it is considered the best only when musical experts so 
decide. In all matters of art the consensus of experts is accepted. 
Grammatical forms are likewise viewed in the order of their 
preference by masters of English rather than by common usage; 
at least they are so accepted in most cases, with an occasional 
exception when universal usage of some term originally considered 
incorrect by experts ultimately authorizes the wrong form by 
sheer weight of volume. 
§3—CurRENT STUDIES 
In the studies reported upon in the latter part of the text, 
expert opinion has been used to a very considerable extent. Sev- 
eral types of appeal have been made to experts. They have been 
asked to give their opinion upon the relative importance of items 
in the curriculum. Wooters (p. 245) obtained from seventy-three 
members of the American Historical Association their opinions 
concerning the relative importance of dates selected from Bourne’s 
‘The Teaching of History.” The heads of the university depart- 
ments of political science, economics, and sociology were asked 
by Horn (p. 251) and Bassett (p. 251) to select twelve books which 
present “the more crucial activities, conditions, and problems 
of present-day life.” Bank cashiers gave Miss Camerer “opinions 
about banking information for depositors.” Business men were 
questioned by Wilson (p. 213) concerning the relative importance 
of arithmetical topics taught in the elementary school. Coffman 
 
-P-A-G-E-76
  68 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
and Jessup (p. 216) requested superintendents to give infor- 
mation upon the same subject. The cumulative opinion of politi- 
cians concerning the importance of political issues by reference 
to political platforms was obtained by Bassett (p. 308). 
The limitations of expert opinion. — Expert opinion is of 
great value but it must not be made a fetish. Bagley (p. 262) noted 
that some members of the American Historical Association failed 
to understand the conditions of elementary education and so 
gave relatively inexpert opinion. The business men questioned 
by Wilson (p. 213) undoubtedly gave snap judgments on what 
arithmetic is used in business. It can be safely assumed that they 
answered the questionnaire with the same speed used in trans- 
acting business, notwithstanding the fact that the subject of the 
questionnaire was one on which they did not have sufficient 
data to make their opinion of great value as to the topics which 
should be either emphasized or omitted. Coffman and Jessup’s 
(p. 216) superintendents were handicapped by the lack of sufficient 
knowledge as to what arithmetic and how much is used by people 
outside of schools. As a matter of fact, all the analytic studies 
show that much less arithmetic is used than the superintendents 
mention. For instance, they think that more attention should 
be paid to interest, yet in the 14,000 problems collected by Wilson 
(p. 223) interest does not have a single appearance. The opinions 
of parents to whom Miss Camerer appealed correlated only to 
the extent of .32 with the opinions of the bank cashiers. 
The use of expert opinion, even when all the facts are available, 
is merely an approximation. The most substantial basis for the 
determination of relative importance is the objective measure- 
ment of the material concerned. Lacking this, expert opinion 
nas its value, but the validity of this opinion is in direct ratio to 
the familiarity of the expert with all the conditions involved.

necessarily of value. As soon as they answer questions outside 
of their own field of specialization, they are almost as liable to 
error in judgment as is any other layman), __ 
Expert classification. — In several instances the investigators 
|
-P-A-G-E-77

have made use of expert classification. Horn (p. 251) used the out- 
lines of Langlois and Seignobos in classifying his historical facts 
by periods. He also checked thirty-eight items against the 
International. Encyclopedia. Monroe (p. 219) followed the Federal 
Census in classifying arithmetic problems by the occupations 
represented. Bagley and Rugg (p. 246) compared their items of 
history found in textbooks with the findings of the Committee 
of Eight. Bassett (p. 251) followed Small’s classification of social 
activities. He also compared some of his findings with the amount 
of space devoted to certain items in the Encyclopedia of American 
Government. Mrs. Dodd (p. 255) determined historical characters 
by reference to the Century Dictionary of Names and Brewer’s 
Reader’s Handbook. 
To those may be added numerous instances of accepted clas- 
sifications within subjects, such as the classification of arithmetic ' 
problems according to the operations involved, of grammar ac- 
cording to the parts of speech and rules of syntax, and of the re- 
lated subjects in the machinists’ trade. The classifications so 
followed were those accepted by all experts, those used by individ- 
ual authorities, or those found in specific books of reference. 
The textbook, used in such studies as Bagley and Rug@’s (p. 246), 
where common elements are observed, may also be considered as 
an expert source, though frequently textbooks have been written 
by men who held no claim to expertness of a high order. How- 
ever, the texts are expert in the sense that the authors have at 
least consulted authorities and provided a body of fact which 
has been generally accepted. But the validity of using the com- 
mon elements in textbooks as a norm rests entirely upon the 
degree to which they contain the material which has been derived 
by either an unconscious or a conscious analysis of objectives. 
If their content has been unduly influenced by tradition or other 
disturbing factors, it is obvious that the composite picture of the 
common elements will be as reliable as the original material and 
no more so.

pilaticn are varied. In some cases topics are npn in other 
cases words, errors, or inches. 
Topics.— Coffman and Jessup (p. 216) and Wilson (p. 218) sub- 
mitted lists of topics to superintendents and business men and 
computed the number of votes given per topic. Miss Camerer 
(p. 326) submitted to bank cashiers and parents of children a list of 
topics concerning which depositors might well have information. 
Fuller (p. 300) obtained a list of home repairs by survey and inter- 
view and submitted them to high school students and their parents. 
Words. — Obviously in spelling the basis must be the word; 
some spelling studies list the words used while others list the 
errors. Most of these studies include all the forms of the word, 
in contradistinction to the vocabulary study, which may list 
only the root form. Not only is the root word “write” included, 
but also its derived forms, “writing” and ‘ written.” 
Errors. — All the studies in language and grammar make the 
error the unit. Sometimes this is the word, at other times a phrase, 
clause, or sentence. 
Specific mention. — In arithmetic a variety of units appears. 
Coffman and Jessup (p.216) and Wilson (p.213 and p. 223) tabulate 
operations, asnoted above, while Mitchell (p. 236), Williams (p.238), 
Callaway (p. 238), and Charters (p. 231) list specific processes and 
quantities. For instance, Mitchell records the number of times 
one-fourth, one-half, etc., occur, while Coffman and Jessup refer 
only to fractions without mentioning the size of the fractions 
specifically. In addition, Williams and Charters list specific 
operations and show their complexity, while Wilson describes the 
complexity without presenting all the material in detail. 
Inches.— Bassett (p.308) uses the inch as the unit in measuring 
the importance of items in political platforms: that is most im- 
portant to which the greatest amount of space is given. This 
is a variant of the method of using the number of words used in 
describing the item and gives the same sort of information because 
we are in the habit of estimating so many words to a page and 
when we know the number of inches to the page we can tell the 
number of words per inch.
-P-A-G-E-79
  RELATIVE IMPORTANCE 71 
Single mention. — Several studies have not been concerned 
with frequency and have paid attention only to occurrence. For 
instance, Allen (p. 274) includes all items in “related subjects” 
without regard to frequency. So also do Greene (p. 287) in sheep 
husbandry, Todd (p. 324) in physical education, and others. Fre- 
quency is not necessary if the limits of time are not narrow or if 
the items are equally important, but if this is not the case, some 
method of selection is necessary. 
Short-cuts. — An interesting problem arises in counting the 
frequency of mention in such subjects as history and geography. 
It was found in the geographical study (p.270) based on The Literary 
Digest, that the mention of countries such as the “United States” 
presented no difficulty in scoring in place geography. If, however, 
one is scoring to find the importance of the country by means of 
frequency of mention, the term “Americans” should also be 
scored, since if the reference appeared as “‘the people of the 
United States” the meaning would be the same and the score 
would naturally be counted. Again, if the Americans were re- 
ferred to as ‘the Yanks” the nickname necessarily ought to be 
noted. Still further, if one is counting all references, pronouns 
could not be omitted since “they” refers to the names of people 
and “‘these” to countries. Finally the term “the Allies’? would 
need to be distributed and each country scored, since it is by im- 
plication of enough importance to be one of the great political 
powers. 
This illustration shows quite clearly that there are a number of 
problems to be considered in determining the scoring unit. In 
this particular case we show that if only geographical names 
(the United States), names of people (the Americans), distributed 
terms (the Allies), were included, the coefficient of correlation with 
the list obtained by the complete mention of all items, including 
pronouns and nicknames, was about .96. Consequently it was 
clearly unnecessary to score nicknames and pronouns in the study. 
Scoring each item. — The problem takes another form when 
a decision is to be reached about scoring each item. Shall we 
score every mention, one mention per paragraph, or one mention
-P-A-G-E-80
  72 "CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
per selection? In the geography study just mentioned, each 
item was scored, but Mrs. Dodd (p.255).scored only one mention, 
of an historical item for each poem, on the grounds that in deter- 
mining how frequently an item was used in poetry it was im- 
portant to determine the number of poems which included the 
item. ‘This would indicate how widely the item was used and 
would be of more importance than to know how many times it 
was used in one poem. The use of ‘‘Alexander”’ in six poems is 
thus much wider than six uses of the word in one poem. Bagley 
(p. 262) in his studies with his students in geography and history 
scored each item of reference once for each article. (If reference 
were made to London as a commercial center and as an art center 
in an article, the city would be scored once for each, but not more 
than one reference to each in the same article.) He states, without 
giving reasons, that this method of scoring was found to be clearly 
superior to that of counting each individual mention. 
On the other hand, Horn (p. 251) and Bassett (p. 251) used the 
paragraph as the unit so that if an item occurs more than once 
in the paragraph it is still scored only once. 
It would make an interesting study to rank the items after 
scoring all mentions and then correlate this ranking with that 
found after scoring one mention per selection, per paragraph, 
and per article. This would be of value because if it can be 
shown that the larger unit presents a ranking of high correlation 
with the smaller units, the saving of time is considerable. 
All these methods have assumed that frequency will give 
some approximate idea of the relative importance of items and 
in the absence of any better method of approximation’ they 
must be used. 
Limitations. — In using them, certain limitations must be 
borne in mind. The first is that if the item is used often enough, 
little attention needs to be paid to it in the curriculum: it will be 
learned incidentally. The words “a” and “the” have a very 
high frequency in spelling but they do not demand attention in 
the course of study because they take care of themselves. If, 
in a list consisting of a thousand words, maximum efficiency is
-P-A-G-E-81
RELATIVE IMPORTANCE 73 
desired, it is for this reason more important to pay attention 
to the less common words than to the most frequent. 
Again in language, when an error becomes very frequent it 
ceases to be an error and becomes correct form. There is, for 
instance, evidence to show that in the judgment of experts the 
most common language errors are not the worst. 
The second limitation lies in the fact that items less frequently 
used are sometimes more important than their quantitative 
ranking would indicate. Adverbs are used much less frequently 
than verbs, but they are just as important. Fractions are used 
only occasionally, but they are quite as important when they 
are used as are the fundamental operations. 
Yet, on the other hand, if we are not concerned with absolute 
perfection and have to choose between the largest number of 
mistakes and a smaller number, it is clear that fewer mistakes 
will be made if the more frequently used items are learned. Upon 
this fact rest the strongest claims for quantitative determination 
of items. If verbs are used more frequently than adverbs it is 
obvious that fewer mistakes will be made per hour by one who 
uses only verbs correctly than by one who uses only adverbs 
correctly. 
Specifically, in utilizing the common elements in textbooks 
as the basis of minimum essentials some items included by only 
a few authors may be much more important than the commoner 
ones used by many authors, because the less frequent items may 
be of later insertion. They may just be. beginning to appear, 
while some of the more common items may be of little current 
value because their usefulness may be waning. Frequency, there- 
fore, as a basis for determining importance has both values and 
limitations and is to be used when nothing better is available. ,

CURRICULUM MATERIAL 
§1—Tue Curricutum as Mrrnop 
We have been concerned up to the present point with the 
topics of the curriculum. We have theoretically learned how to 
determine the ideals and activities which shall be taught and we 
have now arrived at a place where. we are able to discuss the 
methods by which the activities may be carried on. 
Ideals are a part of the curriculum. — At the outset it must 
be insisted: that the curriculum consists of both ideals and activi- 
ties on the one hand and their methods of realization and per- 
formance on the other hand. In a very real sense, education has 
not only to show youth how to control objectives but also how to 
want to control them. It is quite one thing to teach a pupil 
how to wash his hands and tell the truth, and quite another to 
arouse in him the desire for clean hands and honest speech. 
The method of instilling ideals is in particular a pedagogical 
problem for teachers and parents. It is also a matter of direct 
youthful concern and therefore belongs to the curriculum content. 
Curriculum content is method. — In propagating interest in 
the control of ideals it is evident that the curriculum consists 
of methods of achieving objectives, but it is not so evident, 
though equally true, that all the content of the curriculum is 
methodic. Everything taught or discovered, recorded or achieved, 
means of realizing older desires. In childhood they are first 
understood as means to other ends. Loyalty, for instance, 
originally was and still is being developed as a means of attain- 
inz group solidarity. The moral ideals, such as honesty, have 
been accepted by the race only after it was demonstrated that 
74 ae has been a method. Ideals were first formulated and used as~ |
-P-A-G-E-83

CURRICULUM MATERIAL 75 
they constitute superior methods for obtaining the satisfaction 
of a whole range of objectives. 
Facts are methods. — In like manner facts are methods of 
control. In spelling, for instance, it is a fact that pencil is spelled 
p-e-n-c-i-l, but this combination of letters is meaningless except 
as it is a means of putting on paper some characters which will 
describe, or bring to the writer’s mind, or help the reader to 
understand, the object of value for which it stands. Four and 
four equals eight is a fact which is learned because it is a part 
of the method of measuring objects of value. The statement { 
Charles Dickens was an English prose writer is the method by 
which we learn that the character was a writer, that he was an 
Englishman, and that he was a writer of prose rather than poetry. 
The statement is found in the school reader because one or another 
of these minute objectives is thought to be valuable. At the 
beginning of Volume II of a certain treatise on economics is found 
an introductory statement: ‘‘We have defined private economics 
as that portion of the science which deals with private enterprise.” 
As it stands this is the method of recalling to the reader’s mind 
what has gone before, with the very necessary purpose in the 
mind of the author of giving the reader a running start in the 
perusal of subsequent pages. Moreover, if we omit the first three 
words of the statement and substitute ‘‘is” for ‘‘as” the sentence 
is amended as a statement of fact from the author’s point of 
view, and as such is the method of defining the term “private 
economics.’’ Even the fact Bombay is in India is a statement 
by which to locate a city. 
Art is method. — If we consider painting, sculpture, architec- 
ture, “or literature, the same principle holds. Every product of 
the brush, the chisel, and the mallet, the draughting board, and 
the pen is a means of achieving some function. The Bells expressed 
the feelings of Poe about the sounds described. The Venus de 
Milo, the Parthenon, and Cymbeline, each is a medium through 
which an idea is put into concrete form by its creator. 
Not only are they media for the creator, they are in like manner 
methods by which the observer can build up in his experience

the ideal embodied in them by the artist. They are not raw 
material to be catalogued by those who encounter them; they 
were brought into being because they furthered the achieving 
of an objective. They are retained by the race and imparted to 
the young because they assist the rising generation to realize the 
same or similar ends. 
A practical difficulty.— This point of view, presenting the 
material of the curriculum as a method, may not seem to explain 
the feeling that instructors have about teaching information to 
students. It may seem quite far-fetched to assert that all the 
facts in history are methods of achieving ideals or that the facts 
of physiology and chemistry are similarly methodic in their 
nature. It would seem quite useless for the teacher to call all these 
facts methods of control. Yet if we take the longer view we know 
that we collect information chiefly for the purpose of using it. 
The evolutionary function of memory has been that of recall- 
ing useful experience for later application. The beginnings of 
history have lain in the value of the resurrected experience of 
the tribe. All facts are primarily retained because of their use. 
The difficulty which we have just mentioned will clear up if 
we state in addition that the memory often accepts a fact for 
which it, at the time, sees no particular use. It takes it on faith. 
If there is no feeling of faith that some time it will be useful, 
the retention is explained by the fact that the memory, which 
has been trained to retain useful facts, gets into the habit of 
retaining facts whether or not they seem immediately useful. 
This, however, does not absolve the instructor from blame if he 
presents bodies of facts which have no utility so far as he or the 
students can see. There are so many useful facts which can be 
learned and so short a,time in which to learn them, that it is a 
waste of time to require students to learn useless facts. 
Information and conduct. — The relation between informa- 
tion and use may be viewed from another angle. Until quite 
recent years the school has been chiefly concerned with a state- 
ment of methods and only incidentally with putting the methods 
into practice. This distinction has been partially described in 
 
-P-A-G-E-85
CURRICULUM MATERIAL 77 
the aims of education by the terms ‘‘information” and ‘‘conduct.” 
As a matter of common procedure the schools have sought 
to give information upon the assumption that the mere giving 
of information will influence conduct. But a different idea is 
now gaining ground: that in practice as well as in theory, the 
function of instruction is not fulfilled until the information has 
actually modified conduct. 
New material added. — From this distinction arises a new 
mass of subject matter heretofore implied in our discussion. This 
material deals not merely with a statement of the methods by 
which an objective is obtained but also with the methods by 
which this method is put into operation. For instance, in the 
department store a merchandise manual may be prepared to 
provide salespeople with information about how to advise cus- 
tomers intelligently about purchasing. But since the task is not 
completed until they actually use the information in conversation 
with customers, it is a necessary part of the operation that they be 
supervised in their selling until it is apparent that the information 
is being so used. The old view considered that the information 
alone was a valid part of the curriculum. The new behavioristic 
view of information includes also in the curriculum the methods 
by which the information may be properly used. In depart- 
ment stores at least, where salespeople have no exaggerated idea 
of the value of knowledge, the merchandise manual would be 
ignored as a source of information in the midst of more pressing 
duties if the methods of using it were not included. 
_In school the same thing holds true. We were formerly 
concerned primarily with giving information about how to develop 
ideals, for instance; but to this we are now adding a statement 
of the means by which the methods for realizing ideals are to be 
put into effect. The idea that education must modify conduct 
has enlarged the range of the material of the, curriculum.

Evaluating methods.—In achieving the ends mentioned, the 
race has not always been fortunate enough to devise the best

methods upon first trial. Later effort has sometimes brought 
better results. Facts which were true become false when ‘true 
facts” are discovered. Art which was good is superseded by 
better, and machines which were best become obsolete when im- 
provements are invented. 
On the other hand the best is often followed in time by in- 
ferior methods. Many poets have followed Shakespeare but per- 
haps none of them has been his equal. Classical music, which 
is superior music, is usually old. We constantly hear that the 
old methods are better than the new, and in some cases this is 
undoubtedly true since periods of decadence are familiar phe- 
nomena of history. 
Not only are inferior methods followed and _ preceded 
by superior methods, but both inferior and superior methods may 
exist contemporaneously. Crime is handled in some cases with 
laxness and in other cases with firmness. Health may be pre- 
served by exercises, sports, or patent medicines. Tonsils may be 
clipped or dissected.. Railroads may be owned by the state and 
controlled by it, or owned and controlled by private interests. 
Frequently two methods of equal value may be used as alter- 
natives. The Austrian method of subtraction exists side by side 
' with the common method. A score of life-insurance companies 
are about equal in the service they render. Some farmers use 
one method of tilling the soil while their neighbors obtain equally 
satisfactory results with others. 
In selecting for the curriculum subject matter which will realize 
the objectives determined by analysis, we are confronted by the 
task of evaluating the material so as to provide the learner with 
the best or with one or more alternatives of equal value. 
Empirical and scientific methods. — In realizing the objectives 
both empirical and scientific methods are used. The earliest 
stages of control have always been empirical. For generations 
agriculture was unscientific because the machinery for quantita- 
tive testing was unavailable. Moral action is necessarily em- 
pirical because no quantitative methods would ever be available.
-P-A-G-E-87
CURRICULUM MATERIAL 79 
Every art begins in empiricism, and the reputation for superiority 
is determined by consensus of opinion. 
When an art emerges into the second stage of scientific meas- 
urement it is obvious that at first the number of scientifically 
determined methods is small and the disappearance of em- 
pirical methods will be slow. The rate of disappearance of these 
methods depends upon the rapidity with which the scientists can 
test them out and upon the facility with which they lend them- 
selves to testing. In sheep husbandry, for instance, Greene found 
that nearly fifty per cent of the expert methods now in use are 
still empirical although it is one of the oldest of agricultural 
sciences. Indeed, almost all the activities in which men engage 
have only a small fraction of their procedure measured. A few 
highly specialized fields, such as the applications of electricity, 
have a larger proportion of scientifically determined facts; but 
even in these fields the more nearly they approach operation 
under normal conditions, the more closely must they rely upon 
actual experience. . : 
As the result of this the problem of selecting the methods by 
which ideals are realized and activities are performed becomes 
very complicated and requires the highest degree of scholarship 
and of wisdom in knowing which materials will best apply in 
practical situations. If by any miracle the schools could start 
afresh, and the children be taught only by the most efficient 
methods, the sudden rise of the level of civilization would be 
almost unbelievable. 
The dissemination of better and better methods amongst the 
population is the most important of all social agencies. It is 
also one of the most difficult of achievement; this is partly be- 
cause the methods of determining superiority are not always 
well developed, and partly because people are slow to give up 
familiar ways— even though they are inferior —for new and 
strange methods which are patently superior. 
The problem of the schools is theoretically quite simple. The 
best methods of realizing ideals and performing activities must 
be collected. But practically the problem is difficult for the rea-

sons mentioned. This, however, cannot be accepted as an excuse 
for failure to attack it with vigor and intelligence. 
§3—Error as ConTENT 
Functional psychology has made us acquainted with the fact 
that problems arise only when activity is hindered in such a way 
that habit and instinct cannot respond effectively. At the point 
where these fail to function in an adequate manner, reason emerges 
to solve the problem which thus arises. Therefore, the very sig- 
nificant statement can be made that all the achievements of men 
have been made by reason in its effort to overcome difficulties. 
Dissatisfaction stimulates mental activity in order to produce 
better means of achieving satisfaction. 
Errors. — It would therefore seem only natural that the cur- 
riculum should be constructed with the purpose of overcoming 
difficulties in achieving objectives rather than with the purpose of 
achieving objectives. That this is a very real difference can be 
easily shown. For instance, if we assume in spelling that the 
function is to promote communication we can at once see that the 
words most commonly used in communications are a, the, etc. 
If we concentrate our attention upon the difficulties encountered 
in communicating we find the most frequest errors are which, 
separate, etc. Clearly the curriculum in the second case would 
have a quite different arrangement, for in the first case a and the 
would rank high and which and separate would have low frequency, 
while in the second case the emphasis would be reversed. 
The same difference appears in a study of language. If we 
list the rules most frequently used we shall lave a quite different 
order of importance among rules from what is found when we list 
those most frequently broken. So, in the vocations, we assume 
that some of the most frequent duties need comparatively little 
attemtion because they can be Jearned on the job, while the most 
difficult need to be strongly emphasized. 
 
-P-A-G-E-89
CURRICULUM MATERIAL 81 
Bobbitt’s principle. — Bobbitt* has recognized this distinction 
in his differentiation between undirected experience and directed 
training. He holds that children should be allowed to obtain as 
much education as possible from undirected experience upon a 
play level through intellectual roving. Then he believes that 
when this has been gained, directed training should be centered 
upon observed imperfections, errors, and shortcomings found in 
the experience so obtained. His curriculum ‘is to be discovered 
in the shortcomings of individuals after they have had all that 
can be gained by the undirected training.” 
Qualifications. — This point of view is based upon the sound 
psychology just described, but it is subject to three qualifications. 
The first of these lies in the fact that the undirected experience to 
which Bobbitt refers is not undirected so far as the curriculum is 
concerned. It is undirected only so far as the learner’s attitude is 
concerned. No child is permitted to roam where he will. Metes ! 
and bounds must be prescribed. He is not allowed to pick up 
experience from thieves and robbers, nor can he be permitted to 
read lewd and degrading books. Parents and schools prescribe the 
content of the areas over which he roams as he gathers his “un- 
directed” experience. The difficulty arises from the fact that 
Bobbitt has confused the psychology of the child with the con- 
struction of his curriculum. « It is true that while the child browses 
and roves on the play level he feels that he is getting what he 
wants without interference, but the stage has been set for him and 
the limits of experience have been prescribed. 
These limits have not been prescribed on the basis of errors or 
difficulty. They are set for him so that he will be brought under 
the domination of the ideals and activities with which he should be 
brought into contact. They are prescribed not because he has 
failed in achieving them but because he needs to become ac- 
quainted with them. 
The second qualification arises from the fact that in many new 
subjects taught in school there is no preliminary undirected ex- 
*The Curriculum, Houghton Mifflin Co., 1918; pp. 41, ff. 
 
-P-A-G-E-90
82 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
perience and consequently everything presents a difficulty. For 
instance in foreign language study, all words, al) phrases, and all 
inflections present difficulties. In such a case one might better 
fall back upon frequency of use, teach the commonest facts, and 
be done with the job. So also in piano-playing, if a child works 
without directed training she is likely to build up bad habits which 
must later be eradicated. On the other hand, if the most com- 
mon stages early become the subject of directed training the 
possibility of inefficiency would be lessened to some degree. 
But on the other hand, and in the third place, error is of great 
value in determining where emphasis should be placed in the 
teaching of the curriculum. When material has been inserted — 
in the curriculum it follows that some parts of it will be mastered 
quickly while other parts will be learned slowly. Clearly a dis- 
criminating perception as to which parts give the greater amount 
of difficulty will be of great value in deciding where emphasis 
must be placed. It is quite important to know that which and 
separate require special attention in spelling, that verbs present 
more difficulty than nouns in grammar, and that home repairs 
need more attention in manual training than does house construc- 
tion. In short, errors prescribe emphasis; they do not provide 
content. The content is determined by the duties, while the 
emphasis is distributed according to the difficulties. 
A vocational curriculum such as that needed for retail selling 
or for school teaching, a curriculum based upon a difficulty analy- 
sis, is admittedly not a complete curriculum. It deals only with 
the difficulties, and hence could be considered a complete cur- 
riculum only in case every duty were a difficulty, for then a diffi- 
culty analysis and a duty analysis would yield identical lists. 
Much use has been made of difficulty analysis in arithmetic 
and spelling to determine the order in which material should be 
taught to pupils of varying abilities and the amount of emphasis 
to be given to each. Such studies as those made by Halloway, y 
Courtis, Monroe, and teachers’ committees in Boston and in 
other cities are examples.

COLLECTING CURRICULUM MATERIAL 
§1—InrropucTION 
When we wish to determine the methods by which activities 
are carried on and ideals are realized we find that they may be 
obtained from two sources. The recorded part of human achieve- 
ment is found in books, in works of art, and in other material 
form. In addition there is a great mass of unrecorded material 
which is contained in the experience of people who have not : 
put their methods into writing. In the first group we find books, 
sculpture, paintings, music, mechanical utensils, monuments, and 
buildings. In the second group we find material belonging to the 
unorganized fields of knowledge, such as those which deal with 
methods of developing morality, of making social contacts, and of 
performing man’s other duties, particularly in their social re- 
lations. But it is not only in these social fields that methods go 
unrecorded: in all the arts there exists a great mass of material 
which has never been printed but has been handed down from 
master to apprentice and from father to son by word of mouth 
alone. 
§2—Controt ELEMENTS 
- Functional analysis. — In collecting material upon the topics 
of the curriculum the laws of logic demand that certain control , 
elements be set up and that functional analysis be made a con- 
scious method. By “functional analysis” is meant such analysis 
as makes explicit the logical relations between a function and the 
parts of the structure developed to carry out that function. By 
contrast, ‘‘structural analysis” means the analysis of the structure 
into its parts without an explicit statement-of their functions. 
83 
 
-P-A-G-E-92
  - 84 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
Functional analysis requires that after the analysis of the structure 
into its parts has been made, the relationship of each part to 
the performance of the function must be carefully scrutinized. 
The function in this sense becomes the standard by which a de- 
cision is made as to the value of any part of the structure. When 
the structure is being built up to fulfill a function, this function 
is the criterion by which to decide whether or not certain parts 
shall be added or omitted. 
A “structural analysis” of the chair in which I sit yields us 
legs, back, seat, springs, coverings, and arms; but to make a 
“functional analysis” of this article we must add two steps, 
thus making three steps in all. First, the function of this chair 
must be determined: perhaps it is the providing of a comfortable, 
durable, and beautiful article on which to sit. Then, the structural 
analysis into legs, back, seat, etc., is made. In the third place, 
each of these parts must be sized up in terms of function, and if 
the structure is good, each must be justifiable in terms of that 
function. For instance, the springs are built into the seat for 
comfort and, in order to be made-more comfortable, are built 
deep. They are built into the back for the same purpose. The 
quality of the leather and of the springs contributes to greater 
or less durability. The strength of every part of a chair can be 
justified in terms of the function as here laid down, if the chair 
is perfect; but any part that cannot be so justified is defective. 
In constructing the curriculum the same three considerations 
enter. The objective must be set up, the items of the curriculum 
must be selected, and in the selection a process of evaluating 
each item in terms of the objectives must be constantly per- 
formed. 
Control element. — Viewed as a task of outlining and collect- 
ing, the functions become the control elements which determine 
what shall be included and what omitted. If the function of 
spelling is the prescription of the order of letters in words used 
in communication by school children, this constitutes the control 
element of the investigation. Obviously one is concerned with: 
the order of letters, and not with a mere vocabularly; conse- 
 
-P-A-G-E-93
  COLLECTING CURRICULUM MATERIAL "85 
quently it is indefensible to omit writing, written, write, and 
wrote and cover them under the single root word, write. If we 
were studying the vocabulary of children it would be quite per- 
missible to score each of the forms of the word write, but where 
the control elements include the order of letters in the word, 
each of the foregoing has different letter constituents and must 
therefore be included. This control element dictates also the 
kind of themes and letters which are to be analyzed. They are 
to be those of children, not adult letters, newspapers, and 
literary classics. 
Setting up the control elements is particularly important in 
collecting information which must be gathered from many 
sources. For example, in collecting merchandise information 
for salespeople, the range of material is so broad that without 
control elements it would be impossible to know what to include 
and what to discard. In such a case the method to be used is to 
set up control elements and use them as the standard in selecting 
the material. Specifically, in collecting information about shoes 
we know that it is desirable for a salesperson to be able to dis- 
criminate between differences in durability, fit, quality, fashion, 
and comfort. Then, with these items set up as control elements, 
the compiler is able to skim through books on leather, manu- 
facture, anatomy of the foot, foot defects, etc., and preserve any 
facts which will throw light upon the topics. Anything, for in- 
stance, concerning the raw materials or their manufacture which 
would show how or why durability was secured, and anything 
about the anatomy of the feet and the nature of foot defects 
which would have a bearing upon the fit—these would be included. 
Items having no bearing upon any of the control elements would 
be omitted. 
A graph. — This idea may be made somewhat clearer by a 
graph. (See following page.) 
We need to think of each rectangle as having relations both 
to the top and to the side. It is to be used as a depository for in- 
formation concerning an item at the top which has a bearing upon 
an item at the side. In other words, in the space that is related
-P-A-G-E-94
86 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
to durability and raw materials will be inserted those facts con- 
cerning the raw leathers which have a bearing upon durability. 
In the space which is related to manufacture and quality will be 
included those items about manufacture which have a bearing 
upon the superior or inferior quality of the finished product.

While most tasks are so complicated that the material for them 
ean hardly be graphed in this simple way, all of them can be 
handled graphically by the general principle here described. 
“Backgrounds.” — The use of control elements destroys that 
refuge of lazy thinkers which is called the “background.” There 
are those who seek to defend the inclusion of irrelevant material 
in a course by affirming that it provides a background. They fail 
to recognize that the background is subject to the same laws as 
the remainder of the content. The background of a painting, 
from which the term is borrowed, is not just background; its 
details all enhance the function and idea of the foreground. The 
student who has a broad background from which he gathers facts 
to enrich his thinking draws specific facts or feelings and not gen- 
eral or unfocused ideas. The curriculum maker who presents 
backgrounds should, likewise, be able to justify the items of which 
they are constituted by their logical connection with his control 
elements. To attempt to justify the items of which they are 
composed upon the basis of their being mere background is evi- 
dence of superficial thinking. 
This was rather clearly brought out in connection with the 
merchandise study of china made by Miss Ringo. As she col- 
   
-P-A-G-E-95
  COLLECTING CURRICULUM MATERIAL 87 
lected material a good deal of historical matter appeared which 
would interest the salespeople but would not help to explain the 
differences in the control elements. Rather than attempt to 
justify the inclusion of this as ‘“background”— in the usual 
sense of the word — it was decided that a control element must 
be established for it; and so there was added an historical chapter 
illustrating the romance of the potter’s art. With this new control 
element set up, including this mass of historical material was 
made logically possible. 
“Introductions.” — The same criticism can be made of the 
inclusion of the irrelevant as an “introduction.” Many people 
who collect material for the curriculum assume that the introduc- 
tion to the course or topic does not need to obey the laws of logic; 
they succumb to the common weakness of putting into a course 
something of which they are personally fond and for which they 
have no logical justification. But the introduction is as integral 
a part of the material as any other and must be subject to the same 
rigid laws of logic. 
Current studies. — The function in spelling, stated as the de- 
termination of the order of letters in written words used in com- 
munication by children or by adults, leads naturally to the listing of 
all words that have different letter orders. Jones (p.177) analyzed 
children’s communications, Ayres (p. 171) and Cook and O’Shea 
(p. 173) analyzed those of adults. Capps (p. 188) lists only those 
words with whose letter order his high school students have difficulty. 
Incidentally it may be pointed out by way of criticism that 
Cook and O’Shea do not follow the control elements consistently 
because they list zs, are, was, were, being, and been as be. Jones 
(p. 177) fails in a similar manner when he lists plurals in s and past 
tenses under the singular and present forms respectively ‘‘ where 
there was little chance of misspelling.” On the other hand El- 
dridge is justified in using only the root forms because his is merely 
a vocabulary study. 
In the Kansas City grammar study (p. 194) the function of gram- 
mar was assumed to be that of assisting children in the correction 
of errors. This made it logically necessary to analyze the errors |

made by children to see what rules were broken. Mitchell(p.236) 
assumes a very simple function for mathematics which he states 
to be that of being able to read a specified cookbook, a specified 
catalog, and two other sorts of material. In this case his task 
necessarily consisted of listing the mathematics found in the ma- 
terial examined. Bagley and Rugg (p. 246), when they collected 
the material found in texts, assumed no function for their material 
explicitly but utilized the content of the texts as their control 
element. Their problem was that of finding what were the com- 
mon elements and the variations within the series of books. Bas- 
sett (p. 308) assumed the function of civics to be that of giving 
assistance in the practice of government and proceeded to analyze 
the practices as shown in political platforms. All of the other 
studies listed in the second part of this text assume or state certain 
control elements which are usually applied with considerable 
logical severity. 
§3— INTERVIEWING 
Unrecorded methods.— In collecting wnrecorded material 
for the curriculum* intelligent care must be exercised in order to 
obtain accurate descriptions of the methods used. It is very ap- 
parent that the written questionnaire will not provide this informa- 
tion, for reasons which are stated in Chapter XIII. The recog- 
nition that the written questionnaire is inadequate has led to the 
development of the interview as a technical device in curric- 
ulum construction. In the social arts where people have to 
be handled, the two sources from which methods may be obtained 
are the principles of psychology and the expert but empirical 
methods of experienced individuals. 
The methods of psychology. — By the first, the principles of 
psychology are formulated and then applied to solving the prob- 
lems of selling, handling people, or teaching. This method has 
two specific weaknesses. In the first place, scientific psychology 
*“The Collecting of Unrecorded Specifies”, Journal of Educational Research, 
April, 1922. 
   
-P-A-G-E-97
  COLLECTING CURRICULUM MATERIAL 389 
has in certain directions not worked out principles governing 
fundamental problems of the applied field. Particularly, as has 
been said before, psychology has developed comparatively little 
material in connection with the feelings, yet it is precisely in the 
domain of the feelings that we need principles to guide us in han- 
dling people And, in the second place, principles so derived will 
not become valuable until they have copious specific applications. 
Knowledge of a principle does not guarantee wisdom in its ap- 
plication. 
Empirical methods. — The second way to collect methods of 
handling difficulties in the applied field is to find out how experts 
work. This can be learned with more or less exactness through 
interviews. These constitute a fine body of suggestions which, 
when collected, may become the basis for a great program of 
scientific evaluation. For through them, concrete problems are 
provided with specific solutions which have stood the test of 
experience. It is because of these considerations that the pooled- 
information method (based upon duties or activities or upon 
difficulties) has been evolved in our laboratories. 
A difficulty analysis. — We first obtained a difficulty analysis 
based on the compilation of a list of difficulties encountered in 
the operations in the field. In the case of the pooled-information 
method applied to teaching, instructors made a duty analysis 
and checked those duties with which they had difficulty. In 
salesmanship, salespeople were asked to state the difficulties en- 
countered by beginners; executives were requested to give a list 
of difficulties encountered by salespeople; and an observer was 
put upon the task of watching the salespeople and diagnosing 
their difficulties. In the case of the handling of salespeople by 
managers, the salespeople were asked to state the differences be- 
tween good and poor heads of departments; the heads of depart- 
ments were asked the same questions; and the query was likewise 
put to the high executives in several stores. 
In each case the difficulties were thrown into the form of 
questions such as, in teaching: How do you prepare your lessons? 
and, How do you get students interested? — In salesmanship the
-P-A-G-E-98
  90 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
form was similar and as follows: How do you show interest and 
courtesy? How do you display merchandise effectively? — In 
handling people the queries ran: How do you show kindness 
without being easy? How do you get your people to do their 
work efficiently? 
Interviewers. — These questions being formulated, the next 
problem was to train interviewers. In selecting interviewers it 
is important that the prospect should be a logical thinker, have 
a good rhetorical style, and ease of adaptability. He must be 
logical, because the people who are interviewed ramble away from 
the question. Good writing is necessary because it is important 
to retain the flavor of the language and the exact terminology 
of the person interviewed. Adaptabilty is necessary because it 
will seldom be possible to stick to a formal set of subordinate 
questions worked out in advance. The material will be collected 
best by those whose minds can nimbly follow the interview and 
ask the right questions at the right point. 
In training the interviewer it is important that each question 
be gone over with him thoroughly, so that he may clearly under- 
stand how to word it to get the most satisfactory answers. He 
should then conduct one interview, write it up, and bring his 
material back to the group for criticism so that he may learn 
wherein he has failed or succeeded in collecting the methods. 
Particularly important is it to insist that in reading his write-up 
he shall not supplement what he has written by oral explanations: 
everything of importance should be down on the paper. 
Several mechanical points need to be closely safeguarded to 
obtain the best results. The answer to each question should be 
written on a separate sheet or half-sheet of paper. A key sheet 
should be filled out by each person, bearing the name of the 
expert being interviewed, his location, the name of the inter- 
viewer, the length of the interview, the time spent in the write- 
up, and a code number. A corresponding code number should 
be placed upon each answer sheet to refer the compiler to the 
individual who gave the interview.

If the interview embraces, say, seven questions, the material 
turned in should consist of eight or more half-sheets of paper, 
the first being the key sheet, the next beneath it the answer to 
the first question, etc. In all our interviews it is found that the 
use of not more than seven or eight questions gives the best 
results. If more than eight questions are asked the last ques- 
tions are less well answered. In our interviews with two hundred 
and fifty experts in retail selling we found that the number of 
suggestions did not become appreciably greater after we had se- 
cured thirty persons’ ideas; consequently the same question was 
not usually asked of more than thirty. We found also that the 
best thirty salespeople in any retail store use practically the same 
methods as a similar number in another store. 
Certain differences were disclosed in the ability of interviewers. 
About thirty per cent of our interviewers were unsatisfactory, 
because they lacked logical ability, or were not adaptable, or wrote 
up the material very poorly. Some of them also lacked in keen 
interest and persistence. They failed in some cases to ask for 
illustrations. They failed to bore continually into the expert’s 
experience and to keep asking the question: How do you do it? 
Assembling the material.— When the interviews had been 
completed the material was assembled, the first step being to 
throw together all the answers to one question. An illustration 
will make this clear. In assembling the answers to the question, 
“What means do you use to show your people that you work 
with them as a leader rather than as a boss or driver?” we find 
seven different devices used: 
I. Work with them at their tasks 
II. Request rather than order 
III. Share their problems and information with them 
IV. Dismiss or transfer disturbing elements 
V. Give them responsibility and get ideas from them 
VI. Do not ridicule publicly or ‘‘bawl out” 
VII. Be friendly 
Then each page is examined for material on any of these 
seven points. In reply No. 3, for instance, the second and the. 
 
-P-A-G-E-100

third methods are used; in No. 6 the first, third, and fifth; in 
No. 11 the first is suggested; and in No. 12, the first, second, and 
third. 
The compiler of the material runs through all of it and indi- 
cates by lines and Roman numerals in the left margin how it is 
to be sorted out. Then a typist sorts it, typing on a separate paper 
the matter relating to each method, and identifying the method 
by its proper Roman numeral. An assistant then separates these 
and puts all examples of Roman I together, all of Roman II, etc. 
After the material has been put into this form nothing remains 
except to write up the methods. 
What we now have is a collection of methods. To develop 
the psychological principles that apply, it is only necessary to 
ask the question ‘“‘Why?”’ after each of the seven types of method, 
and any answer that may be made to this in terms of psychology 
naturally constitutes a psychological fact. For instance, when 
the first method of leading people, “Work with them at their task,” 
is followed by the question “Why?” the answer is as follows. 
“A leader always appears to his followers to be a member of the 
group.” When the question is asked in the fifth method, “Why 
should the leader get ideas from his followers?” there are two 
answers: (1) In getting ideas from his followers he appeals to 
their self-respect; (2) the leader to maintain his leadership must 
lead wisely and often followers have good ideas. These two methods 
are therefore based upon three psychological facts. The whole 
140 methods listed in the complete study of handling salespeople | 
when submitted to the question ‘‘Why?” will give the material 
for a course on the psychology of handling salespeople. 
Disadvantages. — The weaknesses of interviewing as a method | 
‘are two. First, the material is empirical. (It can, however, be 
evaluated in terms of psychological principles.) Second, the person 
being interviewed tends to state what he thinks ought to be 
done rather than to describe what actually is done. This is not 
a serious objection, however; for when an expert tells us that he 
believes such and such a method to be the best, the fact that he 
himself does not always use it is negligible. 
 
-P-A-G-E-101
COLLECTING CURRICULUM MATERIAL 93 
Advantages. — The advantages of pooling information are as 
follows. Empirical methods of controlling activities are collected 
as a basis for a later program of evaluation so that a decision may 
be made as to which methods are best. This pooled information 
provides a wide range of methods which can be used, at 
least, in the form of suggestions; it accumulates concrete 
solutions to concrete problems; and it furnishes connecting links 
between principles and practice. 
The interview opens up in a thoroughgoing way a rich vein 
of methods which have never been recorded. For, after all the 
formal literature on the subject has been examined, there still 
exist many methods in common use that have not been recorded. 
Many of the latter are better than any that have been put into 
print, because they are more concrete and less likely to be idealized 
by the educational writer, who, in seeking illustrations, is some- 
times tempted to mould them to fit his theory.

GRADING SUBJECT MATERIAL 
§1—InrrRopucTION 
The theory of curriculum construction running through the 
foregoing pages may be gathered together at this point, as the 
methods of collecting subject matter have been described, and 
its grading remains to be taken up. 
The first step in curriculum construction is to determine the 
major objectives, be they citizenship, morality, social efficiency, 
or growth. The decisions as to what these objectives shall be 
rests with those who offer the instruction, and must be the product 
of sagacious and sensitive interpretation of the spirit of the 
generation. 
As the objectives are being determined they must be analyzed 
into ideals and activities, in order to focus on the one hand the 
ideals which should dominate the learner and on the other the 
activities in which he is to engage. The ideals are to be deter- 
mined after careful study of all the supporting facts by those 
responsible for instruction. The activities are not based upon 
opinion but are objectively derived from examination of the 
physical and mental activities in which the individual is engag- 
ing or may in the future engage. 
In the case of both the ideals and the activities, analysis and 
sub-analysis must continue until working units are reached. 
In the case of ideals, the elementary forms which constitute the 
composite commonly used in major objectives (such as the ideals 
of good citizenship) must be determined by analysis to the point 
where they can be handled efficiently. Likewise in the case of 
activities (as these constitute good citizenship) the analysis must 
be continued until topics of sufficient minuteness are reached to 
enable the learner to handle them. 
94
-P-A-G-E-103
GRADING SUBJECT MATERIAL 95 
When this point has been reached there is spread before cur- 
riculum makers a very long list of activities and a shorter list of 
ideals. At this point the task of curriculum construction shifts 
to that of collecting the best methods of carrying on the dis- 
covered activities according to the standards of the selected ideals. 
§2—Tuer PsycuoLocicaL Factors 
Up to this point the ability and interests of the learner have 
hot entered into the discussion except where by implication the 
limits of analysis set at the level of working units were discussed ; 
but from this point forward the learner exercises an increasingly 
important effect on the curriculum. His effect on methods of 
instruction is always evident, of course; but in addition he has a 
profound influence upon the curriculum itself. This influence 
shows itself in various forms. 
From earliest times teachers of the young, and parents in 
the réle of instructors, have been hurled against the stone wall 
of children’s ignorance, incapacity, and lack of interest as judged 
by adult standards. But only within modern times has the 
child been considered to be anything other than a pocket edition 
of the adult. During this period he has come to take an increas- 
ingly important place, although his influence has been felt more 
in the field of methods of teaching than in curriculum construc- 
tion. The effect of increased attention to the capacities of child- 
hood has resulted in four distinct types of theory. 
The culture-epoch theory. — The first attempt to grade sub- 
ject matter from the point of view of the children was a whole- 
sale procedure adopted from the theory of recapitulation of 
embryological bodies. The proponents of the educational analogy 
applied the theory to post-natal life and divided child life into cer- 
tain stages which recapitulated the racial life of man in his ascent 
from barbarism to civilization. From this assumption they pos- 
tulated the principle that the best subject matter for a child in 
any stage of his development was the culture of the correspond- 
ing historic racial stage. So, in the German Folk School the chil- 
 
-P-A-G-E-104
    96 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
dren were taught folk and fairy tales in grade one, Robinson Crusoe * 
in grade two, and the history of the patriarchs and Moses and 
the Thuringian Tales in grade three, with corresponding parallels 
in succeeding grades. 
While the theory had some vogue in the field of education in 
this country it has left traces only in the added attention that is 
now given to primitive materials in the primary grades. That it 
did not remain as a permanent contribution at any other point in 
the curriculum is due to its fundamental lack of soundness as a 
description of fact and to a lack of detail sufficient to give definite 
assistance in the selection of subject matter. Specifically, it 
could not determine which of the folk stories or what parts of 
the history of Moses or of the Reformation should be studied. 
Genetic stages.— More recently another attempt to grade by 
wholesale has been made through the division of child life into 
stages such as babyhood, up to the acquisition of speech; early 
childhood, up to second dentition; later childhood, to the advent 
of puberty; and adolesence, to the completion of bodily growth. 
The methods of curriculum organization deduced from these 
stages rested upon the belief that the moment of optimal ease of 
learning was that at which the interests and activities were strong- 
est within the stages. The rule to be followed was to present ap- 
propriate subject matter at the psychological moment within the 
stage when the interest is functioning most strongly. 
But these divisions have had no more than academic interest, 
because in the first place, like the stages of the culture-epoch 
theory, they lack sufficient detail to afford any practical criterion 
for grading. The period of later childhood, for instance, spreads 
over two or three grades and is, therefore, a classification too 
rough to be used in assigning material to a specific grade. A still 
more serious objection lies in the fact that children do not display 
the advent of interest within the stages at anything like the 
same chronological time. Never has any investigator been able 
so to dissect the stages of development of the children in a class in 
school to such fine detail as to provide a basis for grading the ma- 
terial in a manner suitable for practical classroom procedure.
-P-A-G-E-105
  GRADING SUBJECT MATERIAL 97 
Interests and needs. — The search for the psychological basis 
of the curriculum has of late years taken another form. As noted 
later in Chapter XV, ‘there is a distinct ‘school of educational 
theory which seeks to erect the curriculum upon the basis of chil- 
dren’s interests and needs. They avoid the difficulties of genetic 
stages by refusing to make a genetic classification, and they 
strengthen their position by making a rough approximation to 
the interests which they believe are present in each grade. For 
the most part, however, the selection of subject matter to meet 
the needs and to conform to the interests of childhood in specific 
grades has been a matter of the individual opinion of the particu- 
lar school in which a curriculum was constructed. Moreover, 
courses of study have been built without explicit acknowledgment 
of the necessity of directing the interests of childhood according 
to adult social patterns. 
Current studies. — A few objective studies have been made 
to determine the grades during which selected units of subject 
matter are ofmaximuminterest. In particular, Uhl (p.316) has ob- 
tained the opinions of over two thousand teachers and seven hun- 
dred pupils of all gradés concerning the interest shown in the 
material of readers in current use. Judd* similarly obtained 
opinions from about one thousand teachers concerning the grades 
of children whose interest was best met by the bulletins, ‘‘ Lessons 
In Community and National Life.” 
Methods such as these illustrate the procedure which must 
be followed in placing subject material according to the interests 
of students. After determining major objectives in the form of 
ideals and activities, after analyzing them to the level of working 
units, and collecting the best procedure for carrying on the activ- 
ities, the material must be tried out in the grades, and a division 
concerning placement must be made upon the basis of the dis- 
covered points of grade interest. If a unit is more interesting in 
the second grade than in the fourth, the presumption is that

vancement of Science, 1921.    
-P-A-G-E-106
98 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
(other things being equal) it should be placed at the point of 
greatest interest. 
The factor of utility. — Another method for the gradation of 
material is found in the concept of use. Other things being equal, 
the material should be taught at the moment when the use for it is 
apparent. Sometimes it may be the point of initial use. For 
instance, Jones (p.177) in grading his spelling curriculum included 
within the material placed in a grade those words which first 
occurred in two per cent of the original compositions of school 
children of that grade. His assumption clearly is that when 
words are found to enter the vocabulary of children in original 
themes for the first time, we have reached the point where they 
will be used. While at first glance this appears reasonable and 
may upon complete investigation be found to be sound, it is 
charged with one serious handicap: twenty-four hundred words 
would thus be taught in the second grade, and a decreasing number 
in each succeeding grade. 
The point of greatest usefulness does not always coincide with 
initial appearance. It may occur at any time. The recognition 
of the point of usefulness lies at the basis of the theory of incidental 
teaching of subject matter where it is assumed that the instru- 
mental units, at least, shall be taught at the point of use in further- 
ing some objective for whose mastery they are the instruments. 
Whether use is determined by the onset of general interest 
or by specific situations in which the child finds himself, there is 
no question that the material should in part be graded so as to 
synchronize with psychological moments of utility. 
Difficulty. — The principle of difficulty enters in as a factor 
to modify the criterial factors of interest and of use. Certain 
subject matter may be of interest or of use, but also be so difficult 
to learn that if it be presented, interest will be killed and use will 
be prohibited. 
The principle of classification by difficulty works in two direc- 
tions. It may determine both the moment of initial presentation 
and the amount of emphasis to be given to specific units. In 
general, material must be so graded that a unit shall not be 
 
-P-A-G-E-107
GRADING SUBJECT MATERIAL 99 
presented before the learner has reached the level of ability where 
he may reasonably hope to master it, and instruction must be 
continued until he has mastered it to a satisfactory degree. 
Current studies. — Many results have been obtained in spell- 
ing and in arithmetic. The work of Ballou, Holloway, Rugg, 
Monroe, and others in arithmetic, and of Ashbaugh, Ayres, Buck- 
ingham, and others in spelling, are cases in point. In the voca- 
tional subjects Allen arranges his material in what he calls in- 
structional order and grades the processes in any operation in 
order of difficulty, the simpler being taught first and the more 
difficult later. 
The principle of difficulty has an important bearing upon the 
teaching of coherent subjects where units must be taught in 
series of which the later units are dependent upon the earlier. 
In amorphous subjects, the order is of minor importance. In 
such coherent subjects as grammar, there is no way of avoiding 
the teaching of definitions before rules, although the rules may 
be the items of greatest use, as for instance in the correction of 
errors. Likewise the fundamental portions of arithmetic must 
be learned before problems in fractions, commercial operations, 
or mensuration can be handled with any degree of efficiency. 
§3—Tun RELATION BETWEEN THE PsycHOLoGi@aL Factors 
The foregoing discussion inevitably leads to the conclusion 
that the gradation of subject material is both complicated and 
empirical. In the absence of specific help from educational 
psychology the only method remaining is that of “fumbling and 
success.” The subject matter is first presented in places where 
experience suggests that it is likely to have optimal efficiency; and 
after this initial placement, the opinions of teachers, the results 
of tests, and, occasionally, the conclusions of the pupils them- 
selves will enter to modify and correct the original grading. 
Difficulty and interest. — These criteria of interest, use, and 
difficulty do not necessarily conflict in actual practice. If a 
unit is interesting, it may be easier to acquire; if it is recognized 
LIBRARY MIDDLE TENNESSEE STATE CO, FREESBORO, TENNESSEF      
-P-A-G-E-108
  100 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
as useful, it is more likely to be interesting, and so to be easier 
to acquire. But where interest does not operate strongly enough 
to overcome difficulty completely, then the conflict is present, 
and difficulty will take priority over interest. Material should, 
therefore, first be graded for difficulty, and second placed ac- 
cording to interest, in such a way that no units of excessive 
difficulty shall be presented to the learner at any time. If a unit 
is both difficult and important, it should be saved for the moment 
when the ability of the student is equal to mastering it. 
Difficulty and use. — The principle of use has similar relation- 
ships with interest. If the material is recognized by the learner 
as useful, interest in it is likely to be enhanced; but it must be 
borne in mind, as regards certain units of subject matter, that 
even though the learner may not, as a child, realize their useful- 
ness, we know that their fundamental importance warrants in- 
cluding them. If such a unit is simple enough to be mastered 
by the learner it should be taught, even though at no time during 
his school life can he be stimulated to take a direct interest in it. 
Of this sort are the fundamental operations of arithmetic, some 
of the facts of geography, and, with many children, some of his- 
tory, and in such cases appeal must be made to generic interests 
of the schoolroom. 
Some educators assert that any material which does not evoke 
the whole-hearted interest of the students’ would better remain 
untaught; but the writer believes that fundamental units which 
have adult value and which are not contrary to the law of diffi- 
culty ought to be taught, even where extrinsic forms of interest 
must be relied on exclusively. This does not mean that all rea- 
sonable pains shall not be taken to teach such material in con- 
texts which will demonstrate utility and stimulate interest, 
whenever their difficulty is not too great; but it does mean that 
fundamentally important material must be taught, even though, 
to the child, intrinsic interest and evident utility be lacking.

  GRADING SUBJECT MATERIAL 
§4—Tue Sreprs in CurricuLum Construction 
In the first section of this chapter we epitomized four steps 
in curriculum construction, viz.: selecting objectives, dividing 
them into ideals and activities, analyzing them to the limits of 
working units, and collecting methods of achievement. At this 
point the psychological factors enter and three additional steps 
may be enumerated. 
In the first place the limitations.of time make it necessary 
to rank activities and ideals in the order of importance. Clearly 
not all activities can be taught, since they are infinite in number. 
It is equally clear that some units can best be learned on the 
job. Still other units, such as those connected with religion, 
for various reasons cannot be taught in public schools. All these 
considerations make it necessary to arrange units in their order 
of importance so that those of greatest importance can be learned 
within the school period. 
Before this can be done, however, consideration has to be 
given to certain units which are of importance for children but 
do not rank high among adult activities and ideals. For instance, 
dramatization, games, and fairy stories are clearly not major 
activities of the adult, yet for children they are of primary im- 
portance, according to the criteria of interest, use, and difficulty, 
because they fill very important functions in child life. So also 
among the ideals, obedience requires greater attention in child 
life, probably, than it does in adult society. 
Thus the activities and ideals of children must also be ranked 
in order of importance; and when this is done those that rank 
high in child life and low in adult life should be raised to a point 
of such importance in the final list that they will be included 
in the portions which are to be taught within the school period. 
When these two steps have been taken, when the ideals oD 
activities of both children and adults are ranked and t 
selection of units for instruction is made, the matey 
hould be graded according to the principles of

        102 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
In conclusion, the rules for curriculum construction may be 
stated as follows: 
First, determine the major objectives of education by a study 
of the life of man in its social setting. 3 
Second, analyze these objectives into ideals and activities and 
continue the analysis to the level of working units. 
Third, arrange these in the order of importance. 
Fourth, raise to positions of higher order in this list those 
ideals and activities which -are high in value for children but low 
in value for adults. 
Fifth, determine the number of the most important items of 
the resulting list which can be handled in the time allotted to 
school education, after deducting those which are better learned 
outside of school. ’ 
Sixth, collect the best practices of the race in handling these 
ideals and activities. 
Seventh, arrange the material so obtained in proper instruc- 
tional order, according to the psychological nature of children. 
 
-P-A-G-E-111
THE SUBJECTS OF THE CURRICULUM 105 
This introduces derived subjects. These are service subjects 
which are important not because they are directly useful in the 
performance of activities, but because they are derived from 
material which has practical service value. They are necessary 
to a complete understanding of the primary material. 
There are two kinds of derived subjects: items needed in order 
to understand primary subjects, and others which explain why 
certain processes in the primary groups are carried on. The 
Federal Board for Vocational Education calls the first kind ‘“‘re- 
lated subjects.” In the machinists’ curriculum worked out under 
the direction of Allen (p. 274), the related material in English, 
science, mathematics, and drawing is directly derived from the 
machine operations. 
It is difficult to draw a sharp line between those items of 
derived subjects which are ‘‘necessary to understand” and those 
which “explain the reason why.’’ Viewed without qualification 
the two uses are quite distinct. For instance, in order to under- 
stand how to construct a machine one must know how to read; 
the material read does not necessarily explain why certain proc- 
esses are carried on. But, the distinctions shade off and become 
indefinite when we seek to define what is meant by “necessary 
to understand,” because some people would hold that in order 
really to understand certain things properly one would need to 
know the reason for their operation. ; 
The distinction is of interest because it calls attention to the 
so-called fundamental subjects. Psychology explains why certain 
methods are used in handling men. Physics performs a similar 
service in mechanical engineering. In foods, chemistry provides 
principles of explanation. And in house decoration the theory 
of design serves the same end. 
The primary elements of the subject and the derived elements 
together constitute a very considerable body of information. 
When in mathematics we unite what is revealed in the job analysis 
with what is necessary to understand the operations listed in 
the job analysis, we have in many cases a quite respectable 
amount of mathematics. It is apparent, however, that the material 
     
-P-A-G-E-112
    106 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
included in the subject which is of service in particular groups of 
activities varies with the activities. There is a very small amount 
of mathematics used in sewing, while there is a very large amount 
of it used in engineering; the content of agricultural chemistry 
will be considerably different from the chemistry of sanitation. 
But the important theoretical point is that there is a place for 
the conventional subjects in a curriculum which is derived from 
an analysis of objectives. 
For the derivation of material a definite technique has been 
worked out. In the current studies, Williams (p. 238) has laid down 
rules for the derivation of mathematics used in freshman chem- 
istry. As reported later, he read the text, solved the examples, 
and listed under definite rules of procedure all the items of mathe- 
matics which he found. Mrs. Callaway (p. 238) made a companion 
study for clothing. Greene (p. 287) similarly determined what 
chemistry, botany, and zodlogy are fundamental to the under- 
standing of the practices of sheep husbandry. The items in this 
case happened to be few in number, but taken together they 
might well be included in a general science course in the high 
school. Similarly, Mrs. Dodd (p. 255) determined the items of 
history to which specific reference was made in the poetry utilized 
for admission to the University of Illinois. 
  §2—SysteMatic ORGANIZATION OF CONTENT 
     
         
       Systematic organization. — A very important question fol- 
lows the one already answered. It has to do with the possibility 
of the systematic organization of the material so derived. Specifi- 
cally, it is quite important to answer the question “‘Is the material 
that we obtain in this way a mass of unorganized material which 
lacks the closely knit coherence of the field as organized by the} 
specialist?’”’ Here again the objector can be reassured. It has! 
been demonstrated that the service subjects are capable of being} 
organized quite as systematically as the specialist can organize 
them when he is preparing his material for the solution of his 
own problems. This is made possible by introducing the id 
of “connective tissue.”
-P-A-G-E-113
  
THE SUBJECTS OF THE CURRICULUM 107 
In the ordinary course of curriculum analysis we come in 
time to the point where, the material of a subject necessary for 
fulfilling a function having been provided, it becomes necessary 
to add information within the subject’ which is not directly use- 
ful but which is essential to the understanding of the useful 
material. In the mental field, this added material corresponds 
to connective tissue in the physiological field, whose function is 
merely that of supporting the organs which carry on the physio- 
logical functions. When the muscles of the body are in motion 
in an effort to catch a car the connective tissue cannot be of 
direct assistance, but without its help in supporting muscles 
they could not function. In a similar manner we find that when 
we have derived certain items of the subject which are necessary 
for the performance of activities, we must add additional items 
within the subject, needed for the understanding of the useful 
elements. We are able to illustrate this in two different types 
of studies. ; 
Connective tissue.— When in the Kansas City grammar 
study (p. 194) the grammar rules which had been broken were col- 
lected, it was found that before the pupils could understand any 
tule, they had to grasp certain definitions. For instance, Rule I 
states that ‘‘The subject of the verb is in the nominative case.” 
This involves knowledge of the definitions of subject and predi- 
cate and of the sentence. Subject involves a knowledge of noun 
and pronoun. Nominative case includes case and nominative 
case. Predicate ‘nvolves a knowledge of the verb. Rule II states 
that ‘“‘A substantive standing in the predicate but defining the 
subject agrees with the subject in case and is called the predicate 
nominative.” This rule, to be understood, requires a knowledge 
of the copula, the expletive, and the predicate nominative, in 
addition to any definitions necessary to the understanding of 
Rule I. Rule III reads ‘‘The object of a verb is in the objective 
case,” and this adds new elements of objective, objective case, and 
ransitive verb. 
When to the rules are added these definitions, and the material 
s arranged with definitions first and rules following them, we find     
    
                                                  
    
-P-A-G-E-114
  108 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
that the material is just as coherent and just as systematic as is 
the conventional grammar of the eighth grade. There are fewer 
topics included, but what there are are capable of quite logical 
arrangement. 
As a matter of fact, the constructor of the curriculum would 
be quite justified in adding the items which are introduced solely 
for the purpose of providing a system, if he felt that he could 
demonstrate an understanding of the whole organization as 
necessary to the proper control of the useful operations; but such 
a practice would be rather dangerous to adopt because of the ease 
with which the subject material tends to drop back into con- 
ventional grooves. 
China information. — Another illustration is given by Miss 
Ringo.* In collecting her material she set up as control elements 
the following qualities which customers seek: durability, ser- 
viceability, sanitary quality, beauty, and trade-mark or guarantee. 
We may quote from her statement as follows: 
“When this point had been reached the selection and elimina- 
tion of material assumed great importance. In addition to 
those facts stated in the explanation of any of the five control 
elements, another class of material was included, the so-called 
connective tissue. This was made up of facts which helped to 
bind together what would otherwise have been isolated processes 
and descriptions. In using this type of material, particular at- 
tention was paid to making accounts as vivid as possible. The 
method used may be shown by considering two paragraphs from 
Chapter III. The italicized parts are put in because they help 
to explain how the desirable qualities in@hina are secured. The 
parts which are not italicized are included because they help to 
weld the whole discussion together and to make it more vivid. 
Each fact suggested for the manual was subjected to the test of 
proving whether or not it served one of these two purposes. If 
it did not, it was rejected.

THE SUBJECTS OF THE CURRICULUM 109 
“(1) Materials are often exposed to rain and sun in order 
that they may be thoroughly weathered and may be worked up f 
most successfully. When this process is completed, they are 
carried into the mill, where they are ground and mixed with 
water. The thick, creamy liquid which is produced in this 
way is called slip. (2) Before it can be used it must be purified. 
Tt must be filtered through a thin gauze sieve which catches all bits 
of sand. This helps to furnish a smooth body and one which will 
fuse evenly. Still another thing is necessary. (8) If any 
particles of tron or other metals are left in the slip the firing will 
cause them to spread and stain the ware. Therefore they are care- 
fully drawn out by powerful electric magnets. Because all of these 
bits cannot be removed, cobalt blue is put in to help whiten the 
product just as bluing is used in laundering clothes to give them 
a good color. Sometimes even after all this care, specks of 
metal remain. (4) They may be ground off, but this leaves a 
slight blemish on the surface of the china. 
“The liquid is next pumped into suspended canvas bags. 
High pressure is applied and the water is forced through the 
canvas, leaving the moist clay in the presses. It now has a 
good deal of air in it. (5) This is removed in order to prevent 
bubbles or blisters. The clay is passed through a pug mill, which 
also mixes the material very thoroughly by beating and cutting 
it with knives. (6) When it comes from the mill it looks and 
feels much like putty. It is now so smooth that all parts of it 
should be acted on in the same way during the firing process and 
the ware should be free from flaws due to lumps in the clay. 
“An examination of the italicized parts will show that (1) 
and (2) state facts which affect the durability of wares. They 
stress the need. for ingredients to be in the best possible physical 
condition before being mixed and for them to be purified in order 
that they may fuse evenly and produce ware that is free from 
weakness. The parts numbered (3), (4), (5), and (6) deal with 
means of obtaining good workmanship, which in the manual is 
considered as one essential of beauty. The sentences which are 
 
-P-A-G-E-116
  110 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
not italicized form the necessary connective tissue for points 
relating to the control elements.” 
These two illustrations present slightly different cases. The 
connective tissue of grammar is very logically derived; the in- 
vestigator can study the rules one by one and decide with great 
exactness what definitions are necessary in order to understand 
the rule. In the china manual it is not so easy to determine 
this, because, as has just been said, an effort is made to make it 
vivid and interesting, and just what means will accomplish that 
result is subject to the individual opinion of the one who does the 
work. But here again the greatest care must be taken to see that 
irrelevant material is not introduced and that the connective 
tissues, as far as possible, obey the same laws of logic as do the 
main portions of the subject.   
§3—Systematic AND INCIDENTAL TEACHING 
Incidental teaching. — Still another question is frequently 
raised concerning the method of presenting service material. 
Some investigators are of the opinion that the material in the 
fundamental subjects should. be presented as needed in connec- 
tion with the primary subject. For instance, as the methods ised 
in the handling of men or in retail selling are taken up, the 
chological principles underlying each method may be discussed 
on the spot. Such a procedure does not require or facilitate a 
systematic organization of the fundamental subject. 
Systematic teaching. If this process were attempted in 
connection with the applications of mathematics, the problem 
would not be quite so simple as it seems to be in the case of psy- 
chology. In mathematics it frequently happens that one of the 
first things to be applied is the algebraic equation, and this might 
have to be used before the student could understand the funda- 
mental operations of algebra. So, also, a rule in grammar may 
be needed before a student can understand the underlying defini- 
tions. 
Those subjectsewhich are closely knit, in which one operation | 
is dependent upon preceding operations, cannot be successfully
-P-A-G-E-117
   THE SUBJECTS OF THE CURRICULUM 111 
taught by the incidental method. There is no recourse from 
the systematic curriculum. The simplest parts have to be taught 
first and the superstructure has to be built upon them. 
While some subjects must be taught systematically, and others 
may be, the question arises as to whether all subjects ought to 
be taught systematically. In that connection there is very 
definitely a difference of opinion which the author cannot. hope 
to settle. It is apparent that there are certain advantages in 
giving systematic treatment before the applications occur, with 
the conscious purpose in the minds of the students of getting 
ready for the applications. A student may know just why he 
is studying, and may be easily convinced that all the material 
taken up will be used at a later time. On the other hand, if the 
material is presented point by point, as needed in its applications, 
there is a fineness of spirit in the contact which it is difficult to 
surpass. This, however, may be obtained when the applications 
are made after a preliminary systematic treatment has been pro- 
vided. The only point that must be safeguarded is that when 
subjects are derived from activities it is not necessary that they 
be taught incidentally. 
General service subjects. — A misunderstanding may easily 
arise to the effect that when subjects are derived in the foregoing 
way they must all be small and piecemeal in content. Specif- 
ically, it is claimed,that there must be a carpenter’s arithmetic, 
a grocer’s arithmetic, a machinist’s arithmetic, and a housewife’s 
arithmetic; and that this will tend to duplicate courses and pro- 
vide material in such slight quantities as to be trivial. While it 
is true that such organizations as the Federal Board for Voca- 
tional Education provide special arithmetic (and other subjects) 
for each of the trades which are taught, it is easily possible and 
quite justifiable to have a vocational arithmetic which will in- 
clude the arithmetic needed in many occupations. For all that 
must be done is to throw together the different divisions of service 
arithmetic and teach them all as one course. It might be possible 
in college, for instance, to have a course in agricultural chem- 
istry which would include the fundamentals for all the divisions
-P-A-G-E-118
  
ee en eee 
112 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
of agriculture. Indeed, it would be theoretically possible to have 
a course in applied chemistry which would be applicable to the 
subjects in the colleges of engineering, agriculture, and home 
economics. Specifically all the service science to be used in a 
required high school course of study might be thrown into a 
single general science course. The question as to whether we 
should have special divisions or general divisions is purely a 
pedagogic one, settled upon the basis of the needs of the situation 
and the efficiency with which instruction can be given in one 
type or the other; but intrinsically there is no reason why there 
cannot be a combination of the similar units of each service 
subject into units as large as the instructor finds satisfactory.

CURRENT STUDIES IN SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
§1—Tue SeLection 
Most of the current studies which have been made have fol- 
lowed the line of least resistance and have dealt with subjects 
whose content is definite. Spelling, the most mechanical, has 
been carried farther than any other subject. Grammar has been 
more fully investigated than rhetoric, and arithmetic has proved 
more inviting than history. 
While these definite subjects have been attacked, studies have 
not been confined to them alone. An examination of Table I, 
(p.195), shows that in addition to those mentioned, investigations 
have been made in banking, history, geography, civics, psychol- 
ogy, the machine operations, sheep husbandry, manual arts, 
physical education, and salesmanship. 
Many of these studies are fragmentary, and the technique of 
investigation is much cruder now than it will be later. They 
represent the conscientious striving for methods of attack upon 
the most important educational problem with which this gen- 
eration is faced. 
§2—AssumEeD FuncTIoNsS 
In Table I is shown a list of subjects in which studies have 
been made. This list omits a number of important studies now 
under way but not in form for reporting. It may not include 
all published studies because it is always likely that careful 
search through the literature and extensive written inquiry will 
not reveal everything of worth. It does represent all with which 
the writer is acquainted.

  118 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION | 
The statements of the assumed functions found in Table I are, 
where possible, phrased in the investigator’s own terms, but they 
are sometimes derived by the writer from the investigator’s de- 
scription in the absence of any specific statement. For purposes 
of exposition they are approximately correct. | 
The studies are classified in Table I to show whether they are 
based upon written material, as in the derivation of the spelling 
curriculum by the tabulation of the words found in written letters 
and in print, or whether they are based upon definite extra-school 
activities such as the operations in the machinist’s trade, or upon 
indefinite extra-school activities such as the arithmetic used by 
the parents of children. A classification is also made to show 
whether the function of the subject is that of assisting children in 
their home problems, as in the writing of themes, or of assisting 
adults, as in the writing of business and social letters. these 
facts are shown by checks in the columns headed W (written 
and printed material); d.e.s. a. (definite extra-school activities) ; 
i,e.s.a. (indefinite extra-school activities); ch. ac. (children’s 
activities); and ad. ac. (adult activities). 
Varieties of functions. — The functions which any subject 
ought to serve in the curriculum must, in the last analysis, be} 
determined by major objectives and relative importance; conse 
quently the studies are not concerned with the relative value o 
the assumed function. The investigator must be allowed th 
privilege of assuming what functions he desires, while readers wil 
judge of his results by the intelligence with which he carries ou 
his investigation. | 
It is at once apparent in the perusal of Table I that a wid 
variety of functions for some of the subjects is assumed. All th 
studies in spelling assume that its function is to aid in writing 
with but three variations. Jones (p.177) and Smith (p. 177) tabulat 
the words in written school themes and thereby assume that th 
function is to assist children in their school work. Capps (p.188, 
modifies this by collecting, not the words most frequently use 
but those most frequently misspelled by students. Ayres (p.171 
   
-P-A-G-E-125
  CURRENT STUDIES IN SCHOOL SUBJECTS 119° 
and Cook and O’Shea (p. 173) are, on the other hand, concerned 
with the words used by adults rather than by children. 
In arithmetic a similar wide variety of assumed functions is 
displayed. All but two assume the function to be that of solving 
numerical problems arising in human activities, but each intro- 
duces a variation. Wilson (p. 223) collects problems actually met 
by parents of school children and determines the arithmetic in- 
volved, his assumed function being that it assists in the problems 
of everyday life. Coffman and Jessup (p. 216) ask superintendents 
to make an informal analysis of human activities by stating 
whether or not an itemized list of topics shall be eliminated, or 
continued as at present, or given more attention. Monroe (p. 219) 
assumes the same function, classifies human activities following 
the Federal Census of Occupations, and examines arithmetic text- 
books to see how their problems classify themselves on this basis. 
Wilson (p. 213) in another study assumes the solution of business 
problems as the function of arithmetic and obtains the opinions 
of business men as to what operations are most important. Char- 
ters (p. 231) finds the arithmetic used in business by salespeople. 
Mitchell (p: 236) makes a narrower assumption and investigates 
the arithmetic involved in reading certain printed matter intel- 
ligently. Williams (p. 238) and Callaway (p. 238) assume that 
mathematics is used in freshman chemistry and sewing, and Allen 
(p. 274) that it is necessary in the machinist’s trade. 
In grammar five assumptions are possible, but only one of 
these has been used. All the studies regard the function of gram- 
ar as being that of assisting in the correction of errors in oral 
land written language. 
This variety of function applied to any one subject is of value 
in arriving at a composite curriculum. Particularly is this shown 
in spelling, where it has been possible to combine lists obtained 
rom many of these studies into a common list. This has been 
one by ae Pryor, Buckingham, Horn and Ashbaugh, Starch 
ind Mirick, and others, and the procedure has resulted in a reason- 
ole list of minimum essentials for a course in spelling. 
 
-P-A-G-E-126
  120 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION | 
§3—Tue Activities StupIED 
Written material. — It is interesting to note that when sub- 
jects and functions of subjects have been selected for study those 
in which the material is found in written or printed form are pre- 
ferred. Twenty-eight studies listed in Table I are of such char- 
acter. The reason for this lies in the ease of studying the material, 
since the gathering of written words is easier to perform than the 
compiling of oral errors. Reading a chemistry textbook to derive 
the mathematics gives less difficulty than getting the range of 
practical arithmetic problems encountered by the layman. Analyz- 
ing the processes in the operation of a machine presents fewer 
difficulties than the cataloguing of home repairs. 
But, besides being easier, the use of written material produces 
a greater certainty of results. It provides all the data, while un- 
written material requires unusual care in order to give assurance 
of completeness. The chemistry textbook obviously provides all 
the data within its covers, while a complete list of the arithmetic 
problems of the layman requires a vast amount of detailed collec- 
tion and repetitive checking before the investigator can be [satis- 
fied that all types are presented. 
Definite extra-school activities. — While definite written mate- 
rial has proved to be a favorite field for investigation, five analyses 
of definite extra-school operations, found notably in the trades, 
industries, and agriculture, have also been made. In some cases 
training courses based upon job analyses have been constructed, 
and the policy of the Federal Board for Vocational Education is 
definitely to construct all other curricula upon such analyses as 
that of Allen (p. 274), their chief investigator in the field. In agri- 
culture, Stimson has, for several years, been making analyses. of 
projects, written in syllabus form, with references. The studies 
of Greene (p. 287), who analyzed the sheep project, and the studies 
of Miss Dyer (p. 285), who collected merchandise information for 
salespeople, are of this more definite sort. | 
Indefinite extra-school activities. — Notwithstanding the fact, 
that extra-school activities, such as geographical problems of
-P-A-G-E-127
  CURRENT STUDIES IN SCHOOL SUBJECTS 121 
timely moment, children’s language errors, modern numerical 
problems, and adult correspondence, are admittedly more difficult 
to analyze than are definite vocational projects, thirty-five studies 
have been made in these fields. This is probably due in part. to 
the fact that many of these indefinite activities are presented in 
written form, such as social letters, but particularly to the fact 
that since most of the investigations of the curriculum have 
been conducted by students of elementary education, attention 
has naturally been paid to the more familiar common branches. 
Among the indefinite extra-school activities listed are the language 
errors of children, geography problems of ‘timely moment,” 
“numerical problems of human activity,” ‘crucial life activities,” 
and ‘“‘home repairs.’’ The mere mention of these terms indicates 
the difficulty of the operations of analysis. 
The child versus the adult. — In spite of the very great in- 
sistence laid by many writers upon the necessity of constructing 
the curriculum so as to help. the child to live his child life rather 
than to prepare him for adult life, twenty-nine of the studies 
adopt the adult point of view. Adult business and social letters, 
newspapers, cookbooks, and political and social problems found in 
advanced, textbooks, are some of the material chosen from adult 
life; but, on the other hand, a number of studies dealing with the 
activities of children are included. Twenty-eight studies, includ- 
ing the errors of children’s language, the spelling vocabulary 
found in their themes, the historical characters and events found 
in children’s textbooks, the high school mathematics involving 
sewing, and the mathematics in college freshmen chemistry 
have been made with children’s or with students’ material. 
§4—Tur Detimiration or FIELps 
The delimitation of fields.—In the analysis of material 
the problem of the delimitation of the different subjects enters 
at a number of points in the studies. This appears in connection 
with the query: What is an historical fact, a mathematical fact, 
or a fact in grammar? Sometimes the investigator makes no 
 
-P-A-G-E-128
    122 : CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
  attempt to answer this question, but usually. some limits are 
determined where it is necessary to have them. In the Kansas 
City study of grammar (p. 194) the teachers are told to collect gram- 
matical crrors without being informed as to what the limits of 
grammar are. This is done partly because the teachers are sup- 
posed to know what grammatical errors are, and partly because 
all non-grammatical errors could be eliminated from the tabu- 
lation later. When the tabulations were made it became neces- 
sary to define grammar. This was done by ruling that an error 
which could be explained by reference to a grammatical fact was 
a grammatical error. For instance, a confusion of two, to, and too 
is a grammatical error because the confusion can be clarified by 
saying that to is a preposition, two is an adjective, and too an 
adverb. On the other hand, a confusion of learn and teach is 
not directly grammatical because no rule of grammar will show 
when to use one and when the other. 
In another case Williams (p. 238) defines what he means by 
mathematics by laying down seven rules. Mrs. Dodd (p. 255) 
defines historical characters as opposed to legendary and fictitious 
characters by reference to standard lists of several kinds. 
In general, the more definite the field the less necessity there 
is for formal delimitation; and, vice versa, the less oe the 
greater the need. Particularly any study which is used to deter- 
mine the content of such a subject as sociology must be very 
carefully delimited because of the haziness of its boundaries; but 
in any case it is necessary that delimitation be performed before 
an attempt is made to divide the material of the curriculum 
into subjects. |

CERTAIN TECHNICAL PROBLEMS 
§1—Typican Materia 
In many fields of investigation it is impossible to study all 
the material. The derivation of a spelling vocabulary from the 
written work of children involves, theoretically, the tabulation 
of all the words in all their compositions, exercises, and letters; 
but since there are twenty million children who probably write 
an average of over one hundred words a day for every school 
day, there would be at least four hundred billion words for one 
year. Obviously the treatment of such a mass of material is so 
nearly impossible that some short cuts need to be found. There- 
fore, the selection of samples which will approximate what would 
be found in any total mass is of primary importance. 
Complete data. — In certain studies the problem of sampling 
does not arise because the whole field is covered. When Williams 
(p. 238) found the mathematics used in a specific textbook on 
freshman chemistry he did not need to sample, although if he 
had claimed that his results would hold for all freshman chemistry 
texts, rather than for that examined, he would have had to show 
that the book he examined was typical of the whole list. Grant~ 
ing that Horn (p. 251) and Bassett (p. 251) had typical books, they 
did not need to sample the material in the texts; they examined 
it all. Mrs. Dodd (p. 255) had no problem of sampling because she 
studied all the poetry required for entrance to the University 
of Illinois; nor did Capps (p. 188), since he examined all the written 
material of all his high school students. 
Sampling. — But these are relatively simple cases, and others 
of greater difficulty are much more frequent. For instance, to men- 
’ tion a few problems, Jones’ 15,000,000 words (p. 177), written by 
123 
 
-P-A-G-E-130
    124 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
1050 children of five states, may or may not be typical of the national 
spelling vocabulary of children. Are Anderson’s 3723 letters 
(p. 179) typical, or would more letters from other persons have 
yielded different results? Would Monroe’s lists of problems 
(p. 219) have been different if he had examined another quartet of 
texts? Would Wilson’s 14,583 problems (p. 223), collected from 
4068 parents of sixth, seventh, and eighth grade children in the 
country and small towns of Iowa and in three larger cities, have 
been different if he had collected more problems from other 
parents of children in different localities? Are 6000 grammatical 
errors collected by teachers in one city (p. 194) enough to determine 
the central tendencies of the errors of a city system and of the 
nation? Were Bassett’s political platforms (p. 308) typical of the 
nation? Were his twelve books typical books of the field? These 
queries set the problem of sampling before us. 
Random sampling. — Statistical formule are devised. by 
which one can determine the probability of error in any random 
sample. But these have been computed for very simple situations 
such as tossing coins or throwing dice and, therefore, are far 
removed from a random sampling of the compositions of the school 
children of the nation, or the replies to a written questionnaire. 
It is one thing to toss coins a thousand times and, counting the 
heads and tails, to determine the trueness of the sample; but it 
is quite another thing to say that 6000 errors represent the true 
facts concerning the errors of a whole city of children. Perhaps, 
for example, the children are more careful before teachers than 
when by themselves, or perhaps the teachers are blind to some 
errors. Material, therefore, which seems to be selected at random 
needs to be carefully scrutinized before claims about its trueness 
to type are made. Such a scrutiny is aided by a few rules and 
methods of examination. 
Generality. — In the first place, trueness to type in material 
gathered from a small field should not be claimed for a larger 
field without careful investigation. A course of study based 
upon the spelling vocabulary of one city, or the opinion of busi- | 
ness men of a single community, cannot represent with accuracy 
 
-P-A-G-E-131
  CERTAIN TECHNICAL PROBLEMS ~ 125 
a national spelling vocabulary or the opinions of the business 
men of the nation. National material is obtained by a wider 
sampling. 
This rule is given as a precaution to investigators because 
the most ridiculous claims are made about the universality of 
results obtained from the most meagre amount of data. A teacher 
gets results from the study of his school and blossoms forth with 
a national course of study. Even parents have been known to 
generalize in matters of handling children by reference to a highly 
fanciful idea of the nature of a single child. But while we can 
expect no more of parents, we must demand of schoolmen that 
they make no claims of universality unless they have studied 
enough data to be sure that they are typical of the field about 
which they make the assertion. 
Partitioning data.—In the second place, the amount of 
material which it is necessary to examine may be approximately 
gauged by partitioning it into small units and treating each unit 
separately until no new variations emerge. For instance, if we 
wish to determine the number of cases which must be examined 
for errors in grammar before we can be reasonably certain of 
typical results, the cases may be divided into lots of one thousand 
each and treated as units. That is, the first thousand will be 
tabulated as if it were all the cases. The classes of, errors and 
the percentage of frequency will then be determined. A second 
lot is treated in a similar manner. If new classes or a quite different 
frequency is determined, one can be sure that neither lot is 
typical. The two may then be combined and the total of classes 
and frequency be obtained. A third lot may then be examined 
and added to the first and second. If this obtained result differs 
materially from the total of the first two, the data are not yet 
typical; if it does not materially differ the probabilities are that 
it is approaching trueness. Finally, if a fourth lot when added 
still makes no material modification, it is reasonably certain that 
the four thousand cases are typical. If greater accuracy is de- 
sired, a fifth or sixth thousand may be added to see if the results 
are steady. 
   
-P-A-G-E-132
  126 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
An excellent example of inability to find a typical sample 
is described by Cook and O’Shea (p. 173). For, after dividing the 
letters of each of their correspondents into units of one thousand 
words, they found that in each thousand up to their limit of 
forty thousand words, new words were appearing without dimi- 
nution in number per thousand. It is quite clear, therefore, that 
if they had been interested in getting the total writing vocabu- 
lary of one person, they could not stop at any point below forty 
thousand running words nor could they cease at that point. 
Their examination would have to continue until no significant 
additions were made. 
Variants. — In the third place, analysis of the field to find 
the variants represented in the total sample is a necessary pre- 
requisite of good sampling. Large totals of samples will not 
guarantee trueness to type unless all the variants are represented. 
A very large list of 50,000 grammatical errors selected in one 
city would not necessarily be typical of a national error list 
because there might be other errors found in other language 
areas. To obtain a national grammar-error list it would be neces- 
sary to analyze the language variants in America. This would 
lead us to the fact that we have Anglo-Saxon areas such as 
England and the South, German and Scandinavian areas, areas 
affected by French and Spanish influences, other areas influenced 
by Italian and Polish immigration, and so on. Or, cities might 
be selected which obtain all these variants. Whether samplings 
are made from cosmopolitan cities or from national language 
areas, it is essential that all the variants be recognized and 
represented. 
Similarly, in obtaining a national spelling list, an analysis of 
the spelling variants will show that since spel.ing is ee 
upon what people write about and that what they write about 
varies with the environment, an examination of environments 
would need to be made. This would result in several classes of 
variants, one of which is the large city, the small town, and the 
country, and another, the coast and the inland, and so forth. From 
these, samples should be drawn. In sampling practical arithmetic 
 
-P-A-G-E-133
  CERTAIN TECHNICAL PROBLEMS 127 
problems if the variants are occupational, as Wilson (p. 223) 
and Monroe (p. 219) have assumed, a good sample will have 
many occupations represented. The twelve books selected by 
experts for Horn (p. 251) and for Bassett (p. 251), to be typical 
would have to be selected after an analysis by experts of the 
fields the books represent so that each subdivision is included. 
In selecting history textbooks, Bagley and Rugg (p. 246) ana- 
lyzed their problem by dividing the fifty-year period from which 
books were selected to be examined into four periods and chose 
books from each period. Bassett (p. 308), in sampling political 
platforms, analyzed the political situation into political parties 
and into progressive, conservative, and pivotal states and had 
representation from all. 
Tabulation by units. — When the selections have been made, 
the method of partitioning by variants can be used to advantage. 
For instance, if errors in language are to be tabulated by units, 
these units may be language areas, and the cumulative results 
may be compared with the returns from single areas until im- 
portant differences cease to be observed. This differs from mere 
partitioning into units in that the units. selected are those which 
contain variants. 
Extreme variations. — In such cases, the extremes in variable 
units should all be examined so that if the tabulation cease the 
results may have a theoretically higher degree of accuracy. For, 
obviously, if the less extreme variations are tabulated the totals 
may not be true. For example, it would be better to tabulate 
the errors in Polish centers and Anglo-Saxon New England than 
in Anglo-Saxon New England and the Anglo-Saxon South, since 
the latter two do not present extremes in variation. 
By way of summary, it may be said that to select typical 
material by sampling, care must be taken to analyze the situation 
in order to detect all classes of variants so that representation of 
each may be secured; and also that the totals subjected to exam- 
ination be broken into units, so that by cumulative totalings a 
point may be reached at which important differences in items and 
percentages cease to appear. A necessary check in every attempt 
 
-P-A-G-E-134
    128 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
to obtain typical material is provided by the query: Are all the 
variants included and is the number of cases sufficient? | 
§2—Description or Mrrnops | 
In many of the studies abstracted in the second section of the 
text, the investigators are primarily interested in the results and 
to a less degree in the methods used. The omission or the sketchy 
treatment of descriptions of the methods by which the results 
were obtained is thus explained. But several cases are found of a 
very full description of methods of collection and tabulation of 
material. Outstanding examples are those of Capps (p. 188) 
and Anderson (p. 179). 
In the older sciences, it is bad scientific form to omit mention 
of previous descriptions of methods. But in the studies which we 
are analyzing, the investigators have, with a few exceptions, pre- 
ferred to pioneer in new fields because there are so many problems 
to be studied that no one wishes to cultivate ground already 
broken when he can have the fun of striking out a new furrow. 
But this does not excuse the pioneer from recording his ste inal 
with his results. 
Criticism. — There are four reasons for providing a detailed 
statement of method by the investigator. In the first place, the 
one who reads his results may wish to criticize his method, and 
such criticism is made possible only by a detailed description of 
methods. Criticism of the methods of Cook and O’Shea (p. 173) 
could not have been made if they had not given a statement that 
all derived forms of verbs were omitted from the list, although ability 
to spell the root form does not correlate with ability to spell the 
derived forms, as, for instance, in the words write and writing. 
Horn’s method (p. 251) of determining crucial life activities by 
reference to experts who selected twelve books may or may not 
be correct; but there would be no basis for criticism if he had not 
described his method of determination. Criticism of the methods 
of selecting ora grammatical errors is possible when it is stated 
that they were selected by teachers in odd moments; but no 
criticism would have been possible without this statement. |
-P-A-G-E-135
nn ee ee NM LE re en net eee eT ee eee 
CERTAIN TECHNICAL PROBLEMS 129 
Verification. —In the second place, verification of results is 
not possible unless the procedure is so detailed that an independent 
investigator can follow it step by step. The failure of Horn (033) 
to state the rules by which he settled questions of doubt as to 
“movements, influences, etc.,’’ makes it impossible to verify his re- 
sults. Williams’s seven rules (p. 238) for inclusion of mathematical 
material make easier the task of checking his results, although 
their adequacy can be settled only by actual checking and not by 
his own use. He knew what he meant by the rules, but another 
might not. It is entirely possible to send out the questionnaire of 
Coffman and Jessup (p. 216) to the superintendents of the same 
cities and counties because the authors report the questionnaire 
and the method of selecting the cities. While Miss Camerer (p.326) 
does not state specifically the banks to which she sent her ques- 
tionnaire, it would be possible to check her results by a random 
sampling of banks in the same states. The absence of a report of 
Allen’s method of derivation of material from the job analysis of 
the machinist’s trade (p. 274) (which, it must be recognized, is a 
course of study and not a statement of method), precludes a care- 
ful attempt at verification. 
Improvement. — In the third place, the methods should be j 
given to enable other investigators to use them as a starting 
point. If they are not given they are lost to the craft. Every 
investigator has worked out devices which, if known, would save 
the time of his colleagues. The devices used by Horn (p. 251), 
Capps (p. 188), Anderson (p. 179), and others for scoring are all of 
great benefit to others. The rules given by Wilson (p. 223) for 
collecting problems, the form of the report and many other items, 
including the questionnaires, are all valuable. 
Standardization. — In the fourth place, a full description tends 
to standardize the method. The investigator who follows a meth- 
od can save his own time and make his method just as clear by 
stating that he has “followed Smith” or has followed him with 
stated modifications, as by restating the method. Particularly 
will this tend to destroy the present tendency of teachers all over 
the country to report upon their results without seeming to be  
-P-A-G-E-136
  130 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
aware that others have worked in the same field and thus to make 
comparison of results impossible. 
The reporting of methods in full is laborious and space-con- 
suming, but is it absolutely essential for the growth of the tech- 
nique and should be recognized as such by all who are sufficiently 
interested in the field to work in it. 
| 
When an investigator attempts to determine what items of a 
subject are “necessary to understand’ some situation, he has 
undertaken a difficult task. This is revealed in its most striking 
form in history. | 
If we seek to find what history is necessary to fully appreciate 
the line ‘‘Some village Hampden here may rest,’’ we at once rec- 
ognize the explicit reference to the historical character Hampden. 
An intimate knowledge of his life and his fight for his convictions 
would undoubtedly add to the appreciation of the line. But when 
we inquire into the historical contexts of village, which might 
make its meaning richer, we have no specific reference to tie to 
and we are without a clue to start us on a search; or, perhaps, it 
is reore accurate to say that we have so many clues that we are 
lost among them. The etymology of the term will enrich the 
meaning; so will our knowledge of the Anglo-Saxon village and 
of the country villages of to-day. Again, what flavor is added to 
the word rest? Will the history of the word enrich it? What 
are the fragments of information and experiences which have 
cohered to the word throughout the life of the reader? Is there 
a common, standard, contextual meaning for the word, or does 
each individual have an individual context? And whether the 
latter or the former, how can these be determined? The answer 
to these questions and others of like difficulty will provide a tech- 
nique for determining the history “‘necessary to fully understand.” 
This difficulty has led all the investigators in history to col- 
lect explicit references and to omit its implicit uses. Indeed 
Bagley (p. 262) frankly recognized the difficulty and cubait tates the §3—Imeticir Usr anp Expiicir REFERENCE
-P-A-G-E-137
CERTAIN TECHNICAL PROBLEMS 131 
claim that the history we need is the history that is taught in school 
in textbooks. But this is clearly not an answer to the question, 
which still deserves investigation. 
In the same situation are other “background” subjects, such 
as sociology, economics, chemistry, physics, and mathematics. 
Of some of these it is easier to determine the “service” contribu- 
tions. An examination of Williams’ work (p. 238), for instance, 
shows that he has obtained all or most of the mathematics ex- 
plicitly and implicitly integrated with freshman chemistry. 
But, in the main, ‘all studies have confined themselves to explicit 
references. 
§4—Tum SPECIALIST versus THE LAYMAN 
Attention should be called to the fact mentioned by Monroe 
(p. 219) that in analyzing material to determine, the curriculum a 
clear distinction must be kept in view constantly between expert 
operations and lay operations. In connection with the arithmetic 
of the grocery store it is apparent that the consumer needs one 
level of arithmetical skill and the salesman a much higher level, 
since the former merely checks up simple purchases while the latter 
must know mark-ups, discounts, bookkeeping, and so forth. 
Again, the things which a consumer needs to know about electrical 
appliances are not so highly specialized as those which an electri- 
cian must know. The shoe manufacturer needs to know much 
more about shoes and leathers than does the salesperson or the 
customer. 
This fact has profound significance in the derivation of arith- 
metic and other subjects from the occupations. For, since chil- 
dren are to be consumers of the products of these occupations, it 
would be quite unnecessary and, indeed, quite impossible for them 
to master a curriculum based upon the needs of those who follow 
the occupation. An arithmetic curriculum made up of the com- 
mon elements found in a wide range of occupations might or 
might not be sufficiently near to what is needed; but what is needed 
is determined by an analysis of the operations in arithmetic by 
 
-P-A-G-E-138
    132 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
consumers and not by production specialists. The highly special- 
ized information needed to follow the occupation is given in 
elective vocational courses, and does not belong to the general 
course given to children who later will be experts in only one line 
and laymen in many. 
An interesting example of this difference is found in the dis- 
tinction which is made in engineering information needed by 
executives and by experts, between what a civil engineer needs 
to know about civil engiseering and what an executive in an 
engineering concern needs to know. Obviously the former needs 
to know how to perform the task, while the latter needs to know 
only enough about it to understand and pass upon it. What 
this amount is may be difficult to determine, but it is clearly not 
equal to that needed by the expert. 
The content of all subjects of the elementary school should 
be based upon the layman’s needs. 
§5—Suort Curs 
When masses of material of great proportions or methods 
of analysis of great laboriousness are involved, it is important 
to seek for-methods which will shorten labor without incurring 
serious danger of error. | 
Such methods have not been developed in great number, 
but two cases are of interest. It was discovered by application 
of correlation formule in tabulating the frequency of occurrence 
of geographical references, that the most tedious part of the labor 
could be safely omitted. As described in Study 39 (p. 270), an effort 
was made to determine all the geographical references to places 
in thirteen issues of The Literary Digest. These included names 
of ¢ ries, and localities, names of people, nicknames, pro- 
nouns, and distributed terms. But it was found that names of 
countries and of peoples, and the distributed terms, had a corre- 
lation of .96 with the totals. Therefore, for the approximate 
results necessary for a determination of relative emphasis, the 
three items were sufficient. It would have been interesting in
-P-A-G-E-139
  CERTAIN TECHNICAL PROBLEMS 133 
this study to determine the correlation between these items and 
the items found by ignoring more than one mention of countries, 
peoples, and distributed terms per paragraph and per article. If 
the correlation were found to be high, additional labor would 
have been saved. 
A second method is used by Cook and O’Shea (Study 3, 
described on p. 173). The material to be examined can be 
sampled by being divided into small portions and each portion 
worked up until no new classes of items are added and the per- 
centages do not materially change. 
Undoubtedly many other devices, unknown to the writer, 
have been demonstrated. That there is a need for them is ap- 
parent to any one who has done much work of this sort. 
§6—TuE QUESTIONNAIRE 
The questionnaire is widely used as a means of collecting 
information; Wooters (p. 245), Wilson (p. 218), Coffman and 
Jessup (p. 216), and Miss Camerer (p. 326) all use the usual forms. 
If we consider directions to be a form of questionnaire we find 
other examples in all the language studies, in Horn (p. 251), 
Anderson (p. 179), Capps (p. 188), and others. Its use+is so 
frequent and of such importance that its limitations and the 
safeguards necessary for reliable use should be pointed out. 
Limitations. — There are five limitations. In the first place 
the written questionnaire is intrinsically difficult to fill out. 
Reports show that frequently an office force will spend one or 
two days on a single questionnaire. In any case, whether the 
amount of time is long or short, the questionnaire requires unusual 
labor because it frequently cuts across the order of thinking of 
the one who answers, and asks for information which is not 
easily at hand in the files, the records, or the memory. In the 
second place, the questions may not be clearly understood by 
the one who answers. The sender has one idea of what his terms 
mean; the receiver may get a quite different idea and, therefore, 
in his answers will fail to reply satisfactorily. In the third place,
-P-A-G-E-140
  134 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION | 
the same misunderstanding may occur when the sender interprets 
the answers: he may give the terms a content which the writer 
did not intend. In the fourth place, the sampling may be poor. 
Even when the original list has been carefully sampled, the 
replies will not be a true sample if all do not reply, because only 
certain types of people answer questionnaires. Recently a question- 
naire on store service was sent out to one thousand customers 
selected at random, and one hundred and fifty replied. The 
sender does not now know the extent to which the replies were 
representative, for they came only from people who write with 
facility and who are interested in the questions asked. In the 
fifth place, questionnaires are often answered by people who do 
not give the exact facts. This may be due to lack of knowledge 
or to haste. Wilson’s questionnaire (p. 213) to business men on the 
uses of arithmetic is probably subject to both sources of error. If 
the business men received the questionnaire in the mail or answered 
it in the office, it was filled out, in all probability, at the same 
rapid rate at which letters are dictated and proportionally little 
thought would be given to it. Or, even if more attention than 
this is put upon it, it is a question whether even with much 
thought a business man not trained in such matters actually 
knows how much use he makes of operations in arithmetic. 
Remedies. — Several devices are of use in making the ques- 
tionnaire more reliable. In the first place, before one is sent out, 
it should be tried out on a few people. This preliminary test 
has several advantages. The answers show whether or not the 
questions are understood and are properly framed. In the 
second place, a questionnaire should, as far as possible, be so 
constructed as to be answered by “yes” or “no” or checks. 
The one used by Coffman and Jessup (p. 216) is of this sort. How- 
ever, it is frequently impossible so to arrange material that this 
can be done; the sender may not have the data at hand to enable 
him to make the analysis prerequisite to framing apabiticgs 
questions. 
Interviews. — This leads us to the third device. In all case 
the oral questionnaire is preferable to the written form. Thi 
        
                     
    
                
   
 
-P-A-G-E-141
  CERTAIN TECHNICAL PROBLEMS 135 
means that when the sender becomes an interviewer and asks 
the questions orally he will obtain more reliable answers. He 
can clear up misconceptions of his meaning, and can supplement 
his questions by others which will elicit more definite answers. 
The chief objection to the oral questionnaire is the labor required 
of the interviewer; but this is amply compensated for by the 
greater trustworthiness of the information, the comparative ease 
with which the answerer is able to provide it, and the greater 
amount of time he will spend upon it. Answerers who dislike to 
write, and would spend very little time on written answers, are 
glad to devote considerably more time to an oral interview. 
Recently, the superiority of the interview over the writte 
answer was shown in a study of fifty cases. Seven questions were 
asked of fifty executives, among them being the following: How 
do you show your subordinates that you are interested in them? 
One answer to this question was “By being interested in them.” 
Clearly this reply is useless because it does not tell how he 
shows them that he is interested in them. Now in the written 
questionnaire there would be no recourse from this, because the 
answer could not be easily followed up. But — equally obviously 
—the person conducting an oral interview could at once follow 
it up with a more searching question to bring out the missing 
information. This is what actually occurred in this instance; the 
executive stated, upon further questioning, that he helped them 
to get better positions, even outside his department, and fought 
for increases in salary for them. 
Further, in this same study, when the written answers had 
all been turned in, the same people were interviewed orally. The 
interviewers wrote up their reports upon the same questions asked 
of the same people, and it was found that the returns on the oral 
were 350 per cent fuller than those on the written. Specifically, 
fifty executives gave in writing forty-two suggestions (counting 
duplicates), and gave orally 184 suggestions (counting duplicates). 
Needless to say, senders of questionnaires who are wise will 
cultivate an apologetic attitude toward those upon whom they 
wish to thrust the labor of writing answers, and will imply appre-

ciation of the effort to be expended. This usually includes a 
promise to send the findings to anyone interested; and when such 
a promise is made it should be scrupulously observed. The writer, 
who always sends such replies to his correspondents, felt the thrill 
of a good deed done when recently one of them wrote to say that 
she was startled to receive a reply because in all her experience it 
was the first time that she had ever heard again from the material 
she had furnished. 
So far as graduate schools and schools of education are con- 
cerned, no questionnaire should be issued by a student which has 
not been passed upon by some officer. If this is not done, too 
many may be sent out to a small clientele, some foolish ones may 
be issued, and some may be poorly phrased. Since there is a 
technique of the questionnaire, someone who knows it should 
supervise the issuance,

THE PROJECT AND THE CURRICULUM 
§1—InrRopucTION 
The project and interest. — The term project is used to cover 
a narrower field than that sponsored by Kilpatrick,* who char- 
acterizes the essential quality of the project as purposeful. By 
Kilpatrick’s definition any act which is “whole-heartedly pur- 
poseful’’ becomes a project. This is true of making a dress, run- 
ning a newspaper, listening to a story, or working an original in 
geometry. In short, it is fair, I think, to say that upon this basis 
any school problem, example, topic, drill exercise, test, review, 
application, illustration, demonstration, or practicum becomes a 
project as soon as it has been whole-heartedly motivated. There= 
fore, every school activity may be a project, providing the learner 
prosecutes it with a ‘dominant purpose.” 
As soon as we attempt to use this definition as a method of 
classifying activities, we are completely at sea. Is making a dress 
a project? This we cannot tell until we have watched the indi- 
vidual engaged in the operation. When we find that the activity 
is ‘whole-heartedly purposeful’ it becomes a project by the defini- 
tion, but it is not a project until that point is reached. The twelve- 
year-old girl who has been sewing on an apron for the past six 
months in school, but who is not whole-heartedly interested in the 
activity, is not working on a project. But her companion, who 
loves the work and joyfully sews upon an identical apron, has a 
project. 
Moreover, an activity might, by this definition, be a project 
to-day and cease to be one to-morrow. Our girl who has spent six

months upon an apron may have selected it with great enthusiasm 
and worked on it with vigor for two months. Then her interest 
may have disappeared for one reason or another. So, for two 
months making the apron was a project and for the other four 
months it was not. | 
The truth is that in this case no definition is adequate which 
seeks to classify subject matter upon the basis of interest alone. 
Interest is subjective, dependent upon a series of factors other 
than the content of the subject matter itself; whereas to make an 
adequate classification, the factors according to which the classify- 
ing is done must be objective. 
The project and the problem. — It happens, curiously enough, 
that those who claim to be satisfied with the limited definition 
based on ‘‘whole-hearted interest,’’ and to follow it, when they 
come to actual projects tend to select activities which are all 
characterized by still another element: the problematic — they 
involve relatively complicated and extensive thinking. This is all 
unconsciously a nearer approach to an adequate definition, because 
the project is, in addition to being ‘‘ whole-heartedly purposeful,” 
undoubtedly of the problem variety. The student starts with a 
purpose whose realization is reached by thought and planning 
rather than by mere habit. But, even so, we have not yet em- 
braced in our definition the whole of the essence of the project. 
The natural setting. — As we know, the project came into 
general education through agriculture. Prior to the entrance of 
the “home-project idea” into agriculture, corn was studied out 
of a textbook, with a few experiments in the laboratory. But 
with the introduction of this idea, the boundaries of the school- 
room were enlarged, so that the student, as part of his provers of 
learning about corn, had to grow corn in a cornfield, under the 
concrete conditions of the farm. All home projects sought to do 
the same thing, that is to say, sought to provide condifions for 
school work which should not be different from conditions out- 
side of school work. 
This is essentially what is meant by the “natural setting.” 
If the project is to be used as a vehicle for the study “ arith- 
 
-P-A-G-E-145
THE PROJECT AND THE CURRICULUM 139 
metic, or composition, or physiology, in its “natural setting,” 
the problems studied must be carried on under conditions as 
nearly as possible identical with those outside the school. 
It is quite evident that under these circumstances a student 
may or may not be interested in the project. If he is interested 
at all, he is likely to be very much interested, but presumably 
he will not always be interested, since outside the school not 
every person is interested in everything that he does. 
In conclusion, we may say that for curriculum purposes an 
adequate statement is found in the definition elaborated by 
Stevenson,* that “The project is a problematic act carried to 
completion in its natural setting.” 
§2—Tum Prosecr as CurricuLum ConTENT 
Life activities. — The whole trend of our treatment of the 
curriculum leads us to the position that it is based upon life 
projects. The activities whose analysis we have insisted upon 
are essentially life projects, The individual is dominated by 
systems of interest, for the fulfillment of which he carries on 
mental and physical activity. We analyze these, and by compli- 
cated processes teach him how to carry them on effectively. 
As we have seen, our first task is to determine which of these 
projects are of most importance and to collect the various methods 
of performance. Our second duty is to teach such of these in 
school as are not learned better outside the school. 
In teaching this material we may use subject organizations 
or we may use the project. If we use the latter, then the school 
projects must parallel life projects. We may transfer the project 
from life to the schoolroom, or we may enlarge the schoolroom 
to include life. 
This would be a simple task if the period of schooling were 
long enough to include all the life projects, but actually it be- 
comes so complicated that several modifications must be made. 
*The Project Method of Teaching, Macmillan, 1921.
-P-A-G-E-146
    140 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
The selection of projects. — Because only a few of many 
life projects can be taught in school, it is necessary to set up 
selective machinery. The-analyses of life activities and their 
control give us a great mass of information, skills, and duties 
to master, and in teaching we have to determine which are the 
most important and which the most difficult. We can then 
determine with considerable definiteness what items of subject 
matter must be learned in obtaining efficient control of certain 
life activities. Not being a question of opinion, it can be objec- 
tively determined. 
We face, however, three or four possibilities. We might teach 
all the life activities with concurrent training in the subject 
matter which gives control. But, since this is not possible, we 
have to make a selection from life activities. When we decide 
which to select, we have to take into account the subject matter 
which has been derived from the totality of life activities. In 
other words, it is not enough that our school projects shall parallel 
life activity. We must be sure that in the selection of the school 
projects we are giving the proper amount of training in subject 
matter in order that the pupils may be prepared to meet the 
larger range of life projects. 
Stating the matter in another way, we may say that when 
subject matter has been determined from an analysis of a large 
number of life activities we may upon the basis of this analysis 
know which subject matter is of most importance. When we 
come to select projects we must, if we are to use the project 
method successfully, see that the selected projects will give the 
proper amount of training in the important elements of the 
subject. We have to see, for instance, that our projects give the 
proper amount of drill in arithmetic or in spelling. If we do not 
do this, but merely pick out some projects which parallel some 
of the life projects, we may conceivably fail to give the student 
the training he needs for carrying on other important life proj- 
ects; but if we see that our school projects both parallel life 
activities and include sufficient emphasis of certain important 
parts of the subject matter, we shall then be upon safe ground. 
 
-P-A-G-E-147
  
THE PROJECT AND THE CURRICULUM 14i 
This brief statement will be made clear by reference to Fuller’s 
study (p.300). Assuming that he found the most important proj- 
ects in home repair to be the fifty-seven shown in his first table, 
his next step required him to determine what tool processes were 
involved in carrying out these projects. As a result, we find in 
his fourth table that screwing occurs fifteen times; nailing, four- 
. teen times; filing, twelve times; sawing, eleven; etc. If it is not 
possible (as it is not) to teach the fifty-seven projects analyzed, 
then a selection of projects has to be made. Now, my point is 
that the selection cannot be made at random, or based merely 
upon the interests of children. They must be so chosen that the 
graduates of the course obtain skill in those processes which are 
most useful. It is absolutely essential that the teacher shall 
know the amount of skill that is needed in screwing, nailing, filing, 
and sawing, and shall select home-repair projects to be performed 
which will provide a sufficient amount of these and other proc- 
esses. As a practical measure it is, therefore, wise for projects 
to be supplemented by such amounts of drill as are necessary 
to give an adequate degree of skill. 
This naturally involves the introduction of difficulty of learning 
as a principle of selection. In some cases those principles most 
frequently found are learned so easily that little attention needs 
to be given to them. Others, occurring less frequently, may need 
to be emphasized because of their difficulty. 
These situations show clearly that the selection of school 
projects cannot be lightly undertaken if they are to form the 
sole basis of curriculum content. It is not sufficient that they 
be merely projects occurring outside the school or that they be 
of maximum interest to children: they must parallel home 
projects, but at the same time the projects as selected must pro- 
vide the proper amount of skill and training in the processes and 
activities. What the “proper amount” shall be depends partly 
upon importance and partly upon difficulty. 
Miss Wells, in her admirable book,* attempts to show what 
skills, information, and attitudes were contained in a series of 
*A Project Curriculum, Lippincott, 1921.   
 
-P-A-G-E-148
  142 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
projects. The arithmetic for the first three grades, for instance, 
looks very impressive. But as one examines it he raises the query, 
“How closely does this arithmetic provide the skill upon given 
topics which will best meet all natural, out-of-school conditions?” 
This the author does not answer — nor can anyone until a very 
comprehensive study of life activities shall have been made. 
The alternative to the use of the project as a curriculum unit 
is the school subject. In the latter case the pupils study arith- 
metic, geography, and spelling. In the former case they study, 
following Miss Wells, for instance, playing fair, animals, flowers, 
peanut stands, side shows, playing city, playing house, playing 
store, police department, etc. 
The Revolution. — Nothing can show more vividly than |the 
two foregoing sentences the revolution which would be made in 
school procedure if projects were substituted for subjects. Arith- 
metic, geography, and spelling would disappear and in their places 
we would have such projects as personal cleanliness, the decoration 
of the home, the writing of letters, the growing of flowers, city 
sanitation, city beautification, purchasing, etc. Conceivably these 
might be listed as projects under subjects, but if the project idea be 
logically carried out, subjects must disappear except where, for 
pedagogical reasons, those service subjects which are difficult to 
learn incidentally are taught by themselves. _ 
But it must be insistently emphasized that, whether we teach 
by subject or by project, subject material is derived from life 
projects. We may discard the school project as a unit of instruc- 
tion, but we cannot discard life projects as a basis for deriving 
the material of the curriculum. To discover what shall be in- 
cluded in the subject of grammar we begin, let us say, with the 
life project of correct speech, and derive the broken rules and the 
necessary grammar as shown in Study 10. To determine what, 
tool processes to teach in manual arts we analyze home repairs, 
or some other activities, and derive the processes. Keeping fit 
leads to hygiene. From hygiene we go to physiology, and from 
that we derive biology to understand the physiological facts.
-P-A-G-E-149
  THE PROJECT AND THE CURRICULUM 143 
There is a constant procession of derivatives from the primary 
activities. 
That the material so derived differs from the conventional sub- 
ject material is clear, but that the amount of change is great is 
sometimes evident and sometimes not. For instance, in spelling, 
undoubtedly the lists based upon the recent studies are very 
materially different from those found in the textbooks. In gram- 
mar, the studies indicate that when correction of errors of speech 
is made the basis, the content of the grammar is lessened only by 
the omission of the more difficult and detailed parts of the subject. 
The mathematics necessary for chemistry is found to be very 
much less than the amount which chemists have usually thought 
to be necessary. In the study-in commercial engineering made by 
Strong (p.292) it was found that the addition of a very large field 
of information concerning the handling of men was necessary, and 
that a considerable decrease could be made in the fundamental 
subjects such as mathematics and chemistry. 
The content of the subjects — arithmetic, geography, and his- 
tory — is very difficult to determine. The great mass of activities 
common to all people irrespective of vocation must be determined 
and then analyzed. Methods of control must be collected. Some 
of the subject content will be found in these methods, and the 
rest of it will be found as a derivative from other primary sub- 
jects. From these two sources, by direct inclusion and indirect 
derivation, the material of each school subject is drawn. 
§3—InFoRMATION versus CONDUCT 
The curriculum which is so organized that life projects become 
school projects necessarily involves two types of change. 
Increase in range of subject matter. — In the first place it 
adds an enormous mass of method from which selection must be 
| made. For instance, if, instead of making information about rules 
and definitions the function of grammar study, the correction of 
error becomes the purpose of that study, there is needed not only 
a mass of information about rules and definitions, but also an        
-P-A-G-E-150
    144 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
assemblage of methods by which the children may learn to set up 
the correct habit. In a very real sense the project of correct 
speech involves both grammar and psychology. Without question 
the methods of developing good speech are as essentially a part 
of the subject of language and grammar as are the rules and 
definitions of grammar. Not only are they an essential part, but 
they are if anything more important than are the rules and defi- 
nitions. | 
Similarly, when we consider hygiene as a subject which in- 
volves conduct rather than as one which adds to information, we 
find that the psychology of health and happiness becomes a part 
of the school training. The student must certainly know the rules 
of hygiene — but he must also practice them. The teacher’s task 
becomes not merely that of giving important information, but 
equally of seeing that he puts the information into practice. When 
conduct displaces information as the aim of education, the methods 
of setting up right action after the necessary information has been 
learned become an integral part of the curriculum. 
In the second place, since conduct is made an element in the 
educative process the natural setting is included in the curriculum. 
As a school exercise, the making of a waist consists of three fac- 
tors: the material, the design, and the sewing; but if it becomes 
a project (7.e., is carried on as an act in its natural setting) several 
new factors enter. The student has to consider the matter of 
the preference of the family, the amount of money at her dis- 
posal so as to decide whether to make a general-purpose waist 
or one for special occasions, the amount of time she can spend 
making it and, therefore, the elaborateness of the design, the like- 
Jihood that the fashion may change before the article is worn out, 
and so on. 
The same thing is shown in the case of the boy who is lack- 
ing in ambition. As a school exercise the method of handling 
this is to provide him with reading material showing the advan- 
tages of ambition, with stories of the ambition of great men, 
and with talks upon the value of the virtue. As a project, in 
which he is not descrted until he has become ambitious, it is 
 
-P-A-G-E-151
  THE PROJECT AND THE CURRICULUM 145 
necessary for him to diagnose his failure to show ambition and 
to seek to remove these causes one by one. He must be watched 
for specific situations in which ambition functions, and he must 
be provided with devices which will enable him to show am- 
bition in these situations. 
All of these illustrations indicate that when conduct becomes 
an aim in education the situation becomes much more compli- 
cated and the subject material more diversified. Moreover, since 
conduct is specific rather than general and grows by small working 
units rather than by general principles, it is necessary that a great 
mass of detail be added. Character is built step by step under 
situations in which great principles affect character only by 
specific application to specific situations, so that the amount of 
material studied will need to be doubled. 
Change of boundary. — In the third place, if the project 
method is used as a medium of instruction the school plan will 
be revolutionized, as has been done in the case of vocational 
agriculture. Here, where the home project is used, many startling 
changes are found. The school year is twelve months long and 
the teacher takes his month’s vacation in February. The reference 
library becomes more important than textbooks. The school 
day is changed from the 9-to-4 period to irregular hours, during 
which the boys may be at home or in school or even trading work 
with each other. Automobiles become a necessary part of school 
equipment to enable the teacher to visit his classes. The training 
and equipment of the teacher must be more practical and wider 
in range than is necessary in the school-subject plan. Nor.is 
this peculiar to agricultural projects. Health projects necessitate 
the development of procedure for carrying the school influence 
into the life outside the school. It is very apparent that the 
movement for the use of the school nurse and for health clubs, 
for propagating the work among parents, will all have their 
definite place in the school work when health has been placed 
upon the project. basis. 
Further illustration is not necessary to show what revolution- 
ary results would follow the whole-hearted use of the project 
 
-P-A-G-E-152
  146 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
method of teaching, results so expensive and difficult of achieving 
that the matter cannot be settled without mature deliberations 
and fundamental changes. We shall undoubtedly find that some 
material can best be taught by projects and that other material 
will not lend itself easily to project instruction. If consideration 
is given to the economical use of the physical plant it will be 
found that certain projects may be taught in one school and not 
in another and that some projects cannot be taught in any schools. 
Summary. — The deciding facts in the relation of the project 
to the curriculum are these: First, a project curriculum may or 
may not be taught as a collection of project units, but second, 
even when taught.as a collection of subject units, the subject 
material is derived from life projects. Curriculum content is 
derived from an analysis of life activities and ideals even though 
it be not taught by the school project method. In the third place, 
the change from the ideal of information to the ideal of conduct 
will necessitate a wider use of the project method and many 
fundamental changes in the organization of school work.

Cuaprer XV 
THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CURRICULUM 
§1—IntTRoDUCTION 
The climax of all thought about curriculum construction is 
reached in the curriculum of the elementary schools of the nation 
in which some twenty million are educated each year. Here will 
be found the testing ground of effort and the verification and 
evaluation of methods and curriculum content. 
Unfortunately for ease of treatment, the field is so filled with 
complexities and problems that the determination of the exact 
content of the curriculum is beyond the possibility of immediate 
settlement. In order to determine the curriculum it is necessary, 
on the one hand, to apply the principles laid down in the fore- 
going pages and, on the other, to consider a number of specific 
problems which have emerged in the discussions of the last 
few years. 
The principles. — The principles to be applied are simply 
stated. The activities and ideals of society must be determined, 
evaluated, and selected; the best methods of performing the 
activities under the domination of appropriate ideals must be 
collected; and the material so determined must be presented 
at the psychological moment in the life of a child. These 
principles need no further elaboration at this point since they 
are the topics of the text, but attention can profitably be given 
to a few of the specific forms in which they have appeared in the 
expository statements and controversial discussions of the past 
few years. Specifically, it is important to consider, first, sub- 
jects versus activities ; second, normal child activity versus normal 
adult activity as the basis for the curriculum; and third, ease 
of learning as a curriculum factor.

                        Activities precede subjects.—In order of time, activities 
precede subjects. When, in the course of events, barter and 
exchange had progressed to a point where quantity became 
important, a system of numbering was invented. Geographies 
were first written after generations of men had traveled in pursuit 
of adventure and riches. Chemistry grew out of the effort to 
obtain a limitless amount of gold by the simple transmutation 
of the baser metals. | 
Subjects are abstracted from activities. — When concepts 
such as “number” or “place” have been discovered it has been 
customary to abstract them from their concrete settings and to 
study them in isolation. Number, in the guise of mathematics, 
is an outstanding example of the isolation of a factor from activi- 
ties and of a later magnificent exploration of what is implied in 
the product so abstracted. It likewise provides brilliant examples 
of the later use of certain portions of such abstractions in the 
handling of concrete activities. 
We have here the age-old distinction between the organized 
fields of knowledge and their use in human conduct. From all 
the activities we abstract the concept of number, and study it 
as a whole in the form of arithmetic. We add, subtract, multiply, 
and divide by means of symbols without immediate regard to 
their influence upon human relations. Skill is secured and tech- 
nical information is mastered in isolation from concrete situations. 
Social value of subjects. — But always behind the operation 
there lies in the minds of all (except the specialists) the significant 
hope that the technique may be used in the control of life activ- 
ities. The concept is drawn out of activity for study and is then| 
returned to activity to improve the performance of activity. We 
begin by bartering and use number, then we abstract number| 
and study it, and finally we return with the results of this study 
of number to the activity of bartering with the hope of makin, 
improvements. Such is the social justification of the specialize 
study of any subject.
-P-A-G-E-155
  ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CURRICULUM 149 
This simple procedure becomes the topic of heated contro- 
versy according as partisans lay emphasis on one or the other of 
these two points of view. Subjects in more or less abstract form 
have for the most part, until recently, formed ‘the material 
of the school, and teachers have not held their applications to 
be of significant importance. Arithmetic has been studied, while 
its applications, buying and selling, have been partially neglected. 
Spelling has been learned without sufficient regard to the writing 
of themes and letters. Grammar has been taught without atten- 
tion to its usein the improvement of the errors of speech. Physiol- 
ogy has been memorized without relation to the laws of hygiene. 
And tool processes have been learned without application to 
construction and home repair. 
Keenly conscious of the failure to apply the mastered subjects 
to practical subjects, educators have instituted a new movement 
for the emphasis of application. This has resulted in what we 
have described as the project. 
The neglect of subjects. — Owing to the notorious tendency 
of the voluble part of our pedagogical constituency to drop the 
old and familiar when in full pursuit of the new, the subjects are 
at the present time feeling the neglect (at least on paper) from 
which the staid portions of the profession have in the past pro- 
tected them. Already curricula are now being constructed as 
projects in which theoretically the subjects as such do not appear. 
In Meriam’s significant experiment in Missouri, for instance, the 
subject titles of arithmetic and writing, spelling and grammar 
do not occur in the program of study. The children are supposed 
to learn what they may need of these subjects as they need it 
for carrying on their activities, and it is found that when pupils 
of this school enter the conventional elementary or high school 
it is possible for them to keep abreast with’ those who have 
learned the conventional curriculum. 
It is perfectly clear to me after a number of years of fairly 
close study of the Missouri situation, that the failure to teach 
portions of these subjects as independent material is answerable 
for definite losses of time. For instance, occasions arose when,
-P-A-G-E-156
  150 CURRICULUM ‘CONSTRUCTION 
if the teacher had not surreptitiously introduced grammar or 
arithmetic, the students would not have gained enough of the 
necessary skill to enable them to save their own time. When chil- 
dren began the study of grammar in the high school without having 
had any in the grades a very heavy strain was placed upon 
mothers and fathers in helping the children to catch up. In the 
lower grades there were cases when instructions in the phonic 
construction of the word would have materially aided children 
with weak memories to learn to read with desirable speed. _ 
It is philosophically impossible to adhere to one extreme or 
the other. There are advantages in subject study which arise 
from the absence of concrete items to interfere with the learning 
of bonds and relations. There are advantages in project study 
which arise from the intensifying of motivation and the improve- 
ment of conduct. On theoretical grounds, therefore, any efficient 
system of instruction would include both methods of attack, until 
on scientific grounds it should be demonstrated that one is superior 
to the other. 
As has been pointed out elsewhere, some subjects need less 
independence of operation than do others. Handwriting and 
spelling may be learned incidentally to a much more complete 
degree than can arithmetic. This subject, and all others with a 
closely knit logical connection, are less amenable to incidental 
treatment than such loosely organized subjects as handwriting 
and spelling. 
Primary and derived subjects. — The derivation of the sub- 
jects from the activities is made still more complicated by the 
existence of two classes of subjects. As has been seen elsewhere, 
we have primary subjects which are found in the job analysis of 
life activities, and derived subjects which are obtained by the 
processes of derivation from the primary subjects. Hygiene is a 
primary subject since the rules of hygiene operate directly in the 
control of health. Service physiology is derived from hygiene 
because it explains why the rules of hygiene operate as they do. 
Civics is another primary subject and from it parts of service his- 
tory are derived. Language is likewise a primary subject and
-P-A-G-E-157
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CURRICULUM 151 
from it grammar, handwriting, and spelling are derived. As a 
matter of fact, most of the subjects in the elementary course of 
study are derived subjects, and before the content can be deter- 
mined it is necessary to determine the primary subjects by analysis 
of the activities. 
This fact shows clearly the magnitude of the task of reorgan- 
izing the elementary curriculum. We find it possible to eliminate 
the obviously useless from the subjects by a partial reorganization 
and thereby to perform a useful service, but to secure an objective 
basis for a complete reorganization we must carry through an 
analysis of life activities. The absence of such an analysis under- 
mines the validity of any comparisons between what the curricu- 
lum is and what it ought to be. 
As a matter of fact, and as has been said above, we must deter- 
mine the subject material from an analysis of life projects, and 
determine it in sufficient detail so that we may know which ele- 
ments of the subjects are of most importance and require the 
most attention, either because of importance or because of diffi- 
culty of learning. Then, school projects must be so selected that 
they will give drill and instruction on each of the items: so as 
properly to prepare the student to use them in the broader range 
of life activities. School projects cannot be selected haphazard. 
They are controlled by two factors: on the one hand they must 
parallel life activities, and on the other hand they must include 
the items of the subjects in their proper proportions. 
§3—Normat Curtp Activitius versus Norma ADULT 
ACTIVITIES 
The adult. — The traditional method of arriving at the cur- 
riculum has been to select adult subjects organized for mature 
people. In early days the schools taught the quadrivium, the 
trivium, and the classics in essentially the same form as these were 
used by experts. Within the memory of those now teaching, the 
textbooks in grammar, arithmetic, history, and morals differed 
from the treatises of the scholarly only in their smaller number 
of pages. 
 
-P-A-G-E-158
    
  152 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
The child. — Such treatment of subject matter obviously takes 
no account of the laws of learning or of interest, and the inevitable 
has happened — the champion of the child has arisen to demand 
that the form in which the material is taught shall be determine 
by theqeeds, interests, and ability of children rather than of oat) 
Such a requirement looks very simple on its face, but as soon as” 
it is subjected to analysis a number of tangles appear. Meriam* 
cuts one Gordian knot by asserting that the curriculum should 
be based upon the “normal activity of children.” But we 
find difficulty in determining what is “normal activity” for chil- 
dren. It is not easy to say even what is normal activity for adults, 
yet the task is not impossible. The housekeeper’s activities, both 
mental and physical, are ninety per cent standardized; the degree 
of variation in them is small, because physical circumstances 
determine them.to a considerable extent. 
It is a more difficult problem, however, to determine, with 
anything like the same degree of certainty, a list of normal child 
activities. The little daughter of the housekeeper may in part 
have duties prescribed as practical activities, as when she helps 
her mother, but for the most part practical conditions do not 
enter. The range of play activity is limitless, and so is the range 
of reading. Anything can be played and any book can be read. 
Yet in a very real sense normal child activity is determined by 
normal adult activity. The normal life of a Chinese child differs 
from the normal activities of an American child because, and 
necessarily because, adult Chinese civilization differs from adult 
American civilization. As a matter of fact, those who lay down a 
curriculum which is said to follow normal child life either copy a 
child life which is already a copy of adult life or they make their 
own guess about important adult activities and prescribe them 
for children. From Emile to Schools of Tomorrow, the educators 
who base their curricula upon normal child activities either con- 
sciously or unconsciously use adult activities as a guide. 
The balance. — Here, as always in educational ainsi) we 
have two forces which act together to determine the order of the 
*Child Life and the Curriculum, The World Book Canna 1921.
-P-A-G-E-159
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CURRICULUM 153 
curriculum; neither alone will produce a well balanced producti 
The adult curriculum must be adapted to child needs and abilities, 
and children’s interests must be molded by a considcration of the 
problems which they will face as adults. When Meriam, for 
instance, claims that “efficiency now is the best preparation for 
efficiency later,” the assertion will hold in direct proportion to the 
parallel maintained between the skills, ideals, and activities used 
“now” and “later.’”’ Much remains to be proved before it can 
be claimed with certainty that “efficiency now” in Russian child- 
hood is the best preparation for ‘‘efficiency later’? in American 
adult activities. 
This Meriam recognizes when he says that “adult activities 
in simpler form make up the lives of little people.” But I should 
prefer to turn the statement around: instead of saying that in 
improving their normal activities* we bring them in touch with 
a great range of adult activities, I should say that in touching a 
great range of adult activities we improve the normal activity of 
children. For, whether we do it directly or indirectly, the pat- 
terns of education are adult activities. 
Child activities are modifications of adult activities that are 
produced by differences in ability, interests, and character; but 
the core of the activities is the same. The social recreations, 
esthetic interests, and courtesies are of the same sort among 
children and adults, but because children are less able, they handle 
simpler forms than the adults use. Because their character, judg- 
ment, and wisdom differ in degree, the subject matter of the cur- 
riculum must be modified; the psychological moment in the pro- 
gram of studies for dealing with activities is moved forward or 
-back as the children’s interests change. 
On the other hand, if we approach the problem of directing 
and training child interests and instincts from the child’s point 
of view, it is apparent that there must be considerable symboliza-

tion of adult activities and ideals. The form that the adult 
needs may not suit the child, though any modification of the 
adult form for the child must reach the adult solution. The 
adult may be induced by argument to tell the truth, while the 
child, who would be unmoved by argument, may be deeply im- 
pressed by a narrative conveying the same idea; but the end in 
view for both must ke truth-telling — the solution of the situation 
is essentially the same for both. Modifications must necessarily 
be made because of the differences in ability, ideals, and activities; 
but the point to be remembered and emphasized is that these are . 
modifications of adult activities and not independent entities 
depending upon some concept called ‘normal child life.” 
The same idea appears in another guise when an attempt is 
made to build a curriculum upon the basis of instincts. Here 
again the program of instinct development or control is determined 
ultimately by adult instincts and activities. Whatever may be 
the material used in manipulation of the instincts, those who train 
either consciously or unconsciously keep the perfect adult in mind. 
The learner is trained to-day so that while living his life at this 
moment he will not be lacking to-morrow. If this is not done then 
the training is chaotic and ineffective.

§4—Fase or Learnina 
The amount of time devoted in a eat to items of a 
subject is determined by the importance of the material and its 
difficulty. That is to say, when we have decided that an item 
is of enough importance to be learned, the amount of time given 
to it is determined by how long it takes to learn it. Consequently, 
while the inclusion of an item in the curriculum may be largely, 
though not completely, determined by frequency of use, the em- 
phasis upon the included items is largely determined by frequency 
and persistency of error. ml 
The case is not handled so simply as ‘ib Mindat statement 
would suggest, because something depends upon the standard of 
satisfactory learning. Some items have to e learned until they 
| | 
ke ly

  ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CURRICULUM 155 
are automatic. For others, the mere gaining of a general idea 
is sufficient. And for still other material, a learning sufficient 
for temporary use but not for permanent retention is adequate. 
But speaking generally and without qualifications, it is approx- 
imately correct to say what when an item has been considered of 
enough importance to be included in the curriculum, the amount 
of time spent upon it will be determined by the difficulty of learn- 
ing it. 
Ease of learning affects the sequence of the material in the cur- 
riculum. Obviously, other things being equal, the easier items 
are taught first; and, other things not being equal (as for instance, 
when items of somewhat greater difficulty possess very much 
greater interest), interest rather than ease will be the deciding 
factor in placing the item. 
The enormous importance of the evaluation of difficulties is 
pointed out by Allen in The Instructor, The Man, and The Job, 
by Trilling and others in Home Economics in American Schools, 
and by many other writers. Part of the technique worked out 
in vocational education requires the instructor to list the tasks 
to be performed in a job according to the ease of instruction with 
the expectation that the simple material should be taught first. 
§5—PartiaL REORGANIZATION 
When school faculties are confronted with a periodical mod- 
ification of the course of study, the query naturally arises, How 
can all these methods help us, since we cannot radically reorganize 
our curriculum? Such a question is fair and the answer can be 
given rather concisely. While a radical reorganization may not 
be practicable, it is possible to work over the current curriculum 
and eliminate and add according to selected functions. Par- 
ticularly is it possible to add project and multi-problem material 
to supplement the subject material. When certain life activities 
are important but are not included within the subjects it is pos- 
sible then to add them in the form of projects or of problems.
-P-A-G-E-162
  156 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
A plan. — A plan for the reorganization of the course of study 
by a faculty which has worked under practical conditions, runs 
as follows: 
Place the study in the hands of a steering committee with a 
representative from each subject and one or more from the 
administration. The function of this committee will be (1) to 
lay down the rules of procedure, (2) to determine by conference 
the desires of the faculty as a whole and the ideals to be devel- 
oped in the system, and (3) to pass upon the general adequacy 
of the subject material after it has been worked over by com- 
mittees. On this steering committee should be one person for 
whom the whole project is the major duty. He should be, ex 
officio, a member of all committees. He should, if possible, have 
the major assistance of the bureau of research, if there be one 
in the system. In any case, he should have by him all the studies 
in curriculum material, the course of study used in systems of 
size about equal to that of his own, findings of expert commis- 
sions, and a collection of practical projects. 
The membership of the steering committee should include a 
chairman of each of the subject committees. Each subject 
committee should be composed of teachers of the subject and 
particularly, in addition, of teachers of other subjects. This 
latter group is included because those who teach a subject are 
inclined to magnify it at the expense of the education of the 
child, while those who do not teach it are likely to be better 
able to view it in an objective way and give it its proper 
emphasis. Consequently, in a committee composed of both 
types, the teachers of each subject are usually its advocates, and 
the remainder of the committee are more likely to sit in a judicial 
capacity upon the argument used for it. 
The function of the subject committee is to determine the 
objectives of the subject in relation to the major objectives of 
the whole school system as determined by the steering com- 
mittee. When the objectives of the subject have been deter- 
mined, the revision of the subject is necessarily left in the hands 
of those who teach it. They are responsible for the details of

ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CURRICULUM 157 
      
    
   
    
    
    
              
             the subject committee’s findings, and they report to it for review 
as to the adequacy of the material in fulfilling the objectives 
already agreed upon. 
There may be twelve of these committees: arithmetic, 
geography, history, reading and literature, language and grammar, 
writing and spelling, art, music, physical education, home eco- 
nomics, civics, and the handicrafts. To these, others may be 
added as needed, or combinations may be made. 
Particularly, there should be a committee on codrdination 
whose duty it is to collect a comprehensive group of projects 
and multi-problems. They could place their material at the 
command of the various subject committees and could add to 
the curriculum large and comprehensive projects which do not 
belong particularly in one subject or another. 
Administratively, the chairman of all committees upon whom 
the major portion falls should at the proper moment be relieved 
of other duties, since it is impossible to accomplish any adequate 
amount of revision if this is added to the other regular work of 
the individual. Unless the school provides for such plan in its 
budget, it is extremely doubtful whether the work should be 
undertaken. The course of study cannot be revised as a side 
issue. Even if undivided attention be given to it, the task is 
still difficult. 
§6—Some CurricuLum StupiEs 
Much work of a valuable sort remains to be done in the in- 
vestigation of individual subjects without waiting for the radical 
reorganization of the whole field. A few problems in several of 
the subjects are suggested in the following pages and to them 
numerous other studies can be added by anyone interested in 
the matter. Such investigation should be made by taking small 
problems rather than large and by doing a thorough job with 
insistence upon both care in devising technique and conscien- 
tiousness in reporting new methods or modifications of reported 
methods. The making of hundreds of technical studies is the 
outstanding need of curriculum construction at the present time.

158 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
Handwriting. — Superficially the curriculum in handwriting 
seems a settled matter. Twenty-six small letters, twenty-six 
capitals, a few figures, and some characters comprise the list. 
But, when we consider vertical versus Spencerian forms, and arm 
versus finger movement, as questions of content, we see that there 
are a few problems of selection in even this simple subject. In 
attacking the problem, the first step is to assume some objectives, 
which in this case we may state as the inscribing of ideas in script 
so that they may be preserved or be imparted from one to another. 
In analyzing this function’ we discover three sub-problems: 
the inscribing, or movement; the script, or form of the letters; 
and legibility. To this may be added by some the elements of 
beauty as part of the function. And since the imparting of ideas 
is an essential part of the function, speed becomes an item of 
importance. 
There are, then, several problems, such as the following, 
. which may be studied: 
(a) What movement will produce the greatest speed in sus- 
tained effort? 
(b) What forms of letters are the speediest? 
(c) What are the standards of speed for each of the grades 
expressed in maximum performance and percentiles for 
large groups? 
(d) What are the elements of legibility? 
(e) What movement produces greatest legibility? 
(f) What forms produce greatest legibility under normal 
writing conditions? 
(g) Assuming that handwriting has been learned with some 
degree of efficiency, what are the defects in the hand- 
writing of each individual which produce illegibility or 
slowness? 
(h) What are the most frequent class errors? 
(i) What rules for writing will tend to overcome these defects? 
(j) What is the place of beauty in handwriting? Does it need 
to be considered apart from legibility? If so, is it highly 
correlated with it? 
 
-P-A-G-E-165
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CURRICULUM 159 
(k) What ideals should dominate in handwriting? 
(1) How are these obtained? 
It will be noted that in problems g, h, and i, frequency of 
error is utilized, and this is important because of the probability 
that in the upper grades instruction in handwriting wil’ produce 
the best results when movement and form are directed toward 
curing specific defects in legibility and speed. 
It should be noted that deficiencies in any subject are depen- 
dent upon standards. Frequency of error cannot be utilized as 
a method in any subject in which standards are not available; 
it is one which, to be applied generally (outside such subjects 
as spelling and arithmetic, where absolute accuracy is the stand- 
ard), has had to wait until the past fewyears, when standards 
have been formulated. 
Spelling. — The investigation of the spelling curriculum 
content has been carried farther than that of any other subject, 
as the descriptions in preceding chapters have already made clear. © 
The assumed objectives may be several: adult writing, chil- 
dren’s writing, reading, and the correction of the errors of children. 
The problem of deciding the value of these assumed objectives 
is one worthy of attention. The standards of speed and accuracy 
should be formulated for classes and grades. Frequency of use 
has been the common method of investigation; but frequency of 
error is of primary importance for both individuals and classes 
in the upper grades. There the problems correspond to similar 
problems in handwriting as outlined above. 
An important question to study is the value of the individual 
curriculum in spelling for each class-member based upon his 
own errors, of which record is kept by the pupil or the teacher. 
It involves additional labor and it is important to know definitely 
whether or not it is worth while. 
Language. — The studies of language have all been based upon 
frequency of error. Several questions remain to be studied: 
(a) What is the best objective to assume? 
(b) How should the common errors be apportioned among 
the grades?

Hygiene, physical education, and physiology. — Assuming 
that the functions of this group of subjects are to keep the body 
at a high level of efficiency and to provide recreation, the analysis 
proceeds as follows: 
 
-P-A-G-E-167
  ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CURRICULUM 161 
For efficiency two factors are involved—the conditions under 
which each adult individual lives, such as occupation, opportuni- 
ties for exercise, and so forth; and an establishment of standards 
of a high degree of efficiency. The first is important because 
health is an individual matter in so far as exercise is concerned, 
though it is a group matter in infectious diseases. The second 
provides a basis for the detection of defects. The following 
problems may be listed: 
(a) A study of ‘“normal’’ conditions of adult life with regard 
to possibilities for exercise 
(b) The definition of standards of good health 
(ec) A defect analysis—functional and structural 
(d) Frequency of diseases 
(e) Remedies for functional and structural defects (c) and 
diseases (d) 
(f) Derivation of service physiology to explain c, d, and e 
(g) Collection of devices for putting facts and exercises to use 
For the assumed function of recreation, two problems are 
suggested: 
(a) Analysis of forms of recreation 
(b) Selection on basis of interest and of usefulness for a to 
f above . 
(c) Selection of dominating ideals and collection of methods

Civics. — The function of civics is to help people to realize 
the objectives of citizenship in relation tothe machinery of 
government. Several problems present themselves:

(b) What are the duties of citizens — local, state, national? 
(c) What are the defects of government in the local com- 
munity? 
(d) What information will help to solve these (a, b, and c)?

History. — One assumed function of history is to utilize past 
information and practices to explain modern problems and 
offer solutions. History is used informally in all subjects, and 
formally in history classes. The procedure in both cases is the 
same: list the modern problems and select the historical material 
that will explain them. 
The following problems are important: 
(a) List by frequency of occurrence all problems — moral, 
political, economic — upon which history can throw 
light. 
(b) Collect material (biography, etc.) which will help to solve 
these. 
(c) Decide what can be handled (1) informally and incident-

handling of numbers with speed and accuracy by laymen. The 
following problems suggest themselves:

(frequency of occurrence)? List the types of situation 
which should be examined in order to get a basis broad 
enough for a course in elementary arithmetic.

§1—InrRopUCTION 
The second part of this book is made up of a number of studies 
found in print and in manuscript. - No claims are made that this 
list is complete, although care has been taken to correspond exten- 
sively during the last two years with those likely to know of 
unpublished studies. But with no central magazine existing 
devoted to curriculum construction, or other central agency, it is 
impossible to be certain that all significant studies have been 
secured. Some of the studies have been found quite by accident. 
In deciding which among known studies to include, the choice 
has been made of those which present in some detail the methods 
used in their investigations, since we are primarily concerned 
with that phase of the studies. Because this book represents 
the first attempt to formulate the objective methods used by 
curriculum builders, historical considerations have influenced the 
compiler to select all the commonly known studies made up to 
this time, although in some cases they may not be of first rank 
nor described in sufficient detail to be verified. 
Critics who are accustomed to the exact procedure of the 
older sciences will find much to criticize in the gropings of the 
investigators after a new technique; but such criticism is to be 
expected, and indeed is to be desired, because only through criti- 
cism is improvement made. So, even when the methods are 
crude, they must be compiled and analyzed in order to be con- 
veniently at hand for both criticism and improvement. 
In the summaries which follow, citations are made to the 
original sources where the printed materials may be found fully 
described. Our object has been to describe the methods com- 
169
-P-A-G-E-176
170 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
pletely and to make briefer summaries of any conclusions which 
are of technical or popular interest. 
Apology may not be necessary but is, nevertheless, offered to 
a number of investigators who have been working in the field 
of curriculum construction, but whose methods are not in form 
for definite description. If the appearance of this fairly com- 
plete body of studies stimulates them to publish as soon as def- 
inite results are obtained, so that others may have. the benefit 
of their experience, definite good will result from the publication. 
of this book. 
The studies in spelling are particularly interesting for the 
following reasons: 
(a) The assumed functions and the material studied are 
varied. The members of one group assume that the function 
of spelling is to assist pupils to write themes; these collect 
themes from several states, from a large city, and from the high 
school children of a small town. One investigator collects all 
the errors made by all the children in a high school in all their 
written work. Another group assumes that the function of 
spelling is to assist adults to write letters, and collects social 
and business letters from many sources by going to the files of 
organizations, by obtaining access to the preserved letters of 
families, and by using current letters of the families of school 
children. 
(b) All the investigators use frequency of use or frequency 
of error as a basis for determining importance. Usually the lists 
presented in the studies are composed of words used or mis- 
spelled more than an arbitrarily determined number of times; 
but two investigators limit their lists to words used by more 
than a certain specified number of people. 
(c) Several investigators make secondary composite lists of 
words found in primary studies, and these are being widely 
adopted by the schools. 
(d) The instructional order of teaching the words is studied 
by two investigators. One bases his order by grades on the 
time of first emergence of the word into the vocabulary of the
-P-A-G-E-177
  SPELLING 171 
grades, and the other tries out composite lists in the grades of 
several cities. : 
(e) We are particularly fortunate in having two very detailed 
descriptions of methods used in collection and tabulation. In 
one of these the technique of delegating the task of collection 
to children and, in the other, to teachers, is described. 
§2—VocaBULARY OF PERSONAL AND Business LETTERS 
(Study 1) 
Ayres* endeavored “‘to find out whether or not there exists a 
fairly definite body of words so generally used in ordinary cor- 
respondence that they should form the core or basis of the spelling 
vocabulary taught in the lower grades of our elementary schools. 
The investigation was limited to the analysis of simple business 
and personal letters because the <rdinary person requires a knowl- 
edge of spelling only when he writes and he writes only personal 
memoranda and letters, but does not write books or articles.” 
The material consisted of 2000 letters obtained from adults 
who wrote to twelve sources as follows: a mail order business, a 
physician, the query department of a city newspaper, a lawyer, 
school teachers (from parents of pupils), a publishing firm, sec- 
retaries of the Y. M. C. A., a playground association, a philan- 
thropic organization, family letters, and a few love letters. 
The letters contained 110,160 words. A random sample was 
obtained by tabulating the first words of each line of every letter 
and making separate tabulations of the different salutations and 
endings. By this means 23,629 words were obtained. Of these 
the total number of individual words was 2001—that is, there 
was a total vocabulary of 2001 separate words obtained as a result, 
of tabulating nearly 24,000 words taken at random from 2000 
letters written by 2000 different people.

-P-A-G-E-178
172 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
Of the 2001 words, 751 appeared only once and one of them 
was repeated 1080 times. The records show that 43 words fur- 
nished one-half of the aggregate number. The first nine of these, 
consisting of one quarter of the occurrences, are as follows: J, the, 
and, you, too, your, of, for, and in. One-eighth of the occurrences 
were furnished by the three words J, the, and and. 
Special attention was paid to the salutations and endings. 
The 542 words which constitute seven-eighths of the words, tab- 
ulated with the figures showing the number of times each word 
appears, are given in the monograph. The writer calls attention 
to the fact that this is a very small group of words and that ad- 
ditional study should be made to discover which those words are 
that constitute the foundation of the vocabulary used in ordinary 
letter-writing, with the recommendation that these words should 
then be taught first and taught so thoroughly that through 
applying them to everyday use the children will permanently 
master them. 
§3—Tue Speriine Scalp 
(Study 2) 
Ayres* carried his investigation further and sought to de- 
termine a curriculum of 1000 words which could be arranged in 
order of difficulty with standards for the different grades. In 
doing this he combined the lists of Knowles, Eldridge, his own 
1913 list, and the Cook and O’Shea lists. The 1000 words were 
selected by “finding the frequency with which each word appeared 
in the tabulations of each study, weighting that frequency accord- 
ing to the size of the base of which it was a part, adding the four 
frequencies thus obtained, and finding their average. The re- 
sulting figure shows how many times the word was repeated in 
each 100,000 words of written English. The aggregate of written 
material analyzed in securing these results was approximately 
*Measuring Scale for Ability in Spelling, Division of Education, Russell 
Sage Foundation, Pamphlet No. E 139, 1915. 
 
-P-A-G-E-179
SPELLING 173 
368,000 words written by some 2500 different persons. More 
than two-thirds of the material consisted of personal and business 
letters.” 
When the 1000 words were collected they were divided into 
fifty lists of 20 each and these lists were given as dictated spelling 
lists of 70,000 children in 84 cities. By statistical computation 
the words were scaled and combined for the particular grades, 
so that eventually a spelling scale was obtained in which words 
were arranged in 26 columns each of which contained words of 
approximately equal difficulty, and the median standards for 
each grade from two to eight were determined. 
Many other scales and studies of relative difficulty have been 
made in this field. Buckingham* determined the difficulty of 
a small, ‘elected list of words in terms of distances from a zero of 
spelling ability. He has also added recently an extension to the 
Ayres Spelling Scale**. Ashbaugh took the three thousand words 
derived by Anderson and found the difficulty of each word for 
each grade ***. 
§4—InTensive Stupy or Famity Lerrers 
(Study 3) 
Cook and O’Shea * * * * studied over 200,000 words in the per- 
sonal correspondence of thirteen persons, of whom five were men, 
eight were women; six of this group were related. Their academic 
training ranged from third grade to college graduation. The letters 
bore forty postmarks from many sections of the country and 
from abroad. Six contributed 5,000 words each; three, 40,000; 
one, 24,000; one, 6,000; one 8,000 and one, 12,000. The investi- 
gators claim that the written vocabulary of letters between mem-

bers of a family is more nearly typical of a standard vocabulary 
than are business letters or themes, since the personal letters 
between members of a family. constitute the bulk of correspond- 
ence not performed by stenographers. 
In arranging the vocabulary a number of rules were kept in 
mind. The dictionary basis was adhered to, resulting in the list- 
ing of nouns in the singular nominative only, except where the 
plural is habitually used, and then the singular form does not 
appear. All forms of the personal pronouns were used except 
ours, yours, and theirs. Only the positive degree of adjectives 
occurs, except that the comparative or superlative occurs for those 
few that have no positive form. In verbs the present infinitive 
is considered the root form, with the result that is, are, was, etc., 
are always checked as be. Words of identical spelling and like pro- 
nunciation are not differentiated in any way; for instance, pin 
is not differentiated as a noun and as a verb when so used. Words 
of identical spelling but dissimilar pronunciation are included 
only once. J, a, and O are not included. All syncopations are 
entered as though written in full, except o’clock. All abbreviations 
are written in full, Mr., Mrs. etc., and O.K.; except the initials 
of persons, which are disregarded. Baby talk is excluded, but 
colloquial expressions if found in the Standard Dictionary are 
included. All dates, street numbers, all quantities of money 
expressed in figures, all hours of the day expressed in numerals, 
as 5.45, and all numbers over one hundred, except round numbers 
like a thousand, are excluded. Compounds are counted as two 
words. Foreign words and proper names are segregated in a 
special list. Their totals are noted but their occurrence in the 
vocabularies of individuals is not determined. 
The vocabularies of the thirteen individuals are kept separate 
so that the individual range and the common occurrence can 
be noted. The latter is significant because the relative frequency 
of totals needs to be supplemented by indications of the common 
use by all as against high frequency by a few. A word with high 
frequency and common use should be given greater importance 
than one of similar frequency but used by a smaller number.
-P-A-G-E-181
SPELLING 175 
Then, too, the excessive use of an unusual word by one person 
might give it undue importance in the totals if the individual 
lists were not used as a check. 
The words so obtained are classified in four lists. List I con- 
sists of 186 words used by all the correspondents; List II is made 
up of 577 words used by a majority of the correspondents; List 
III, composed of 2207 words, is used by less than a majority; 
and List IV comprises 2230 words used by one writer only, and 
of these 1804 occur only once. In these lists (only the first three 
of which are published) the frequency of total occurrence of each 
word is shown as well as the occurrence of each in three spellers 
which were used as checks. Their occurrence in the Ayres and 
Chancellor lists is also noted. Distinctions are noted to show 
whether the words are common to all women and all men, to a 
majority of men and of women, to less than a majority, and to 
only one correspondent among men and among women. 
Twelve hundred and nine different proper names occurred 
in the 200,000 running words, with a total of 9,740 occurrences. 
Words identical in spelling except for the final s (as William 
and Williams) were counted as a single word, all nicknames, pet 
diminutives,-and spellings based on personal predilections were 
reduced to standard orthography; and the envelope addresses 
were included when present. All towns of less than 10,000 popu- 
lation, all strictly local publications, organizations, and streets, 
all family names except those of historical characters or of men 
in the public eye, are omitted from the lists presented. These 
lists are composed upon the same basis as the lists described in 
the preceding paragraph. List I consists of the one word Saturday, 
used by all correspondents. List II is composed of 30 words 
used by a majority. List III of 137 words used by less than a 
majority. And list IV of 862 names used by only one corre- 
spondent, of which 544 occur but once. 
Comparison is made between these lists and the words found 
in 3 spellers, one of which is probably the most widely used 
speller in the schools of the nation. It is found that only 35 per 
cent of the words in the three spellers occur in the letters, but 
   
-P-A-G-E-182
  176 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
seventy per cent of the words common to the spellers occur in 
the letters. In spite of the fact that the common words should 
appear more heavily in List I and less heavily in Lists II and 
III, it appears that twenty-seven per cent of List I, thirty-three 
per cent of List II, twenty-eight per cent of List III and twelve 
per cent of List IV occur in the spellers. No proper name is com- 
mon to all spellers. The chances of any proper name occurring 
in two spellers range from sixteen in one hundred to forty-two 
in one hundred. Of the 110 different proper nouns in the spellers 
only six appear in the letters. 
Furthermore, one word, in, in General List I does not appear 
in the spellers; eleven in List II, 202 in List ITI, and 625 inList IV. 
Tabulations of the number of new words added per thousand 
words of each correspondent are made. This shows that even as 
many as 40,000 running words do not exhaust the vocabulary. 
Interesting analyses of individual writers’ vocabularies are made. 
Six comparisons are also made showing the wide variation between 
the vocabularies of men and of women. Among women, the 
dominant words are connected with articles of food, terms relating 
to consumption and preparation thereof; articles of wearing 
apparel, textiles, terms related closely thereto; parts of the body, 
care of them, personal appearance; animals; esthetics, color; 
diseases, their treatment, concrete sensitivity for good or ill, 
terms closely related thereto; parts of house, furniture and furnish- 
ings, measures; correspondence, other domestic activities and 
relationships, and an unclassified list of 180 words. The words 
dominant in the letters of men are classified as follows: terms of 
aggression, contest and domination, physical and mental; institu- 
tional life and social organization; and an unclassified list of 91 
words. 
Dominance is determined by the occurrence of a word in a 
higher list in one sex than in the other. For instance, blister is 
considered a dominant word among women because it belongs to 
List ITI for women correspondents and to List IV among male 
correspondents. In general there are 404 of these words found in 
women’s letters and 128 found in those of men.

§5—Tue VocaBuLary or CHILDREN’S THEMES 
(Studies 4 and 5) 
Jones* (4) investigated the problem: ‘What words, grade 
for grade, do children use in their own free written speech, and 
what words, therefore, do they need to know how to spell?” 
Themes were collected from 1050 students in grades two to 
eight in Illinois, Maryland, Iowa, and South Dakota. One-third 
were collected from Illinois, one-third from Maryland, and one- 
third from the other two States. Approximately 150 children 
from each grade above the first were included. Themes were set 
by the teachers as part of the regular class work, not on book 
topics (to avoid a reading vocabulary). They wrote not more 
than thirty minutes. Over-age students’ themes were not included. 
(A second-grade pupil whose age at the beginning of the year was 
over eight years and no months was considered over-age.) The 
theme-writing was continued until the tabulations showed the 
addition of no new words. By the time most of the students had 
handed in forty themes the flow of new words had almost ended, 
- and when for eight or ten themes no new words were added the 
student’s ‘word-well was counted approximately dry.” 
The number of themes ranged from 56 to 105 per student; 
the total number examined being “a little over 75,000” and the 
themes averaged a little less than 190 words. Thus the total 
number of words recorded was approximately 15,000,000. In 
this large array there were only 4,532 different words used by two 
per cent or over of the children in the grades in which the word 
first appeared. About 200 words in all were ruled out as being 
used by only one or two students. For spelling purposes derived 
forms, such as have and having, were counted as different words, 
but where there was little chance of misspelling, as in the addition 
of s or ed.to another word, the word was not counted as different, 
as in shoe and shoes.

  178 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
The words are classified according to the grade in which they 
first appear and are used by two per cent of the students in that 
grade. Consequently, the second grade has the largest number. 
The numbers run as follows from grades two to eight: 1927, 469, 
442, 432, 425, 419, and 418. The average vocabulary by grades 
from two to eight is as follows: 521, 908, 1235, 1489, 1710, 1926, 
and 2135. 
Practically every word in the list of 4532 was misspelled by one 
or more students; the highest number misspelled by any one 
student was 87, and the smallest, 18. The average for the 1050 
students was 48. 
The most frequently misspelled were which, 321 times; their 
and there, 612 times; and separate, 283 times. This investigator 
compiled the well-known list of “One Hundred Spelling Demons” 
as follows (the order is not significant after the first four) :

J. Smith (5) from the examination of 75,000 running words taken 
from the spontaneous composition of children from grades three 
to eight inclusive, in equal quantities from each grade, in the 
Madison, Wisconsin, schools. He omits personal, possessive, and 
demonstrative pronouns; the numerals, ordinals, and articles; 
about thirty of the most common prepositions, conjunctions, 
verbs, and adverbs; and local proper names. 
Following the classification of Cook and O’Shea he finds 272 
words used by all grades; 542 words used by at least three of the 
six grades; and 344 words used by only two different grades. 
§6—An Extensive Stupy or Letrmrs To PARENTS 
(Study 6) 
William N. Anderson, in his dissertation* on The Determina- 
tion of a Spelling Vocabulary, Based upon Written Correspon- 
dence, studied 3723 letters to. supplement and expand the work 
done in previous studies, to show, comparatively, the number of 
words that are common in the writing vocabularies among persons 
of various callings, to show the extent and range of vocabularies 
used by persons in certain different callings, and to point out the 
educational significance of these findings. 
The letters were written by adults engaged in over 35 different 
occupations and callings in the State of Iowa and, with a few ex- 
ceptions, were collected by the public school children of the 
seventh, eighth, and ninth grades of 23 towns and cities. 
The directions are as follows: 
“University of Iowa, unpublished.
-P-A-G-E-186
  | 180 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
“To the Superintendent and Teacher: 
“We are asking your kind assistance and codperation in this 
study on spelling, to be made according to the ‘Directions for 
Pupils’ sent you. Our purpose is to make a careful and extensive 
study of the words collected in this manner. We prefer to have 
the work done by any two grades above the fifth, including high 
school. Other things being equal, the seventh and tighth grades 
would probably be the most suitable. 
“Tn order to simplify the work we have endeavored to make 
the directions as complete as possible. These directions have 
been worked out while the work was carried on in different grades 
of the Experimental School of the University and in the public 
schools of Iowa City. We found most of the pupils very much 
interested and glad to do the work. The enthusiasm of the pupils, 
however, will depend largely on the attitude and spirit of the one 
in charge of the class. It is desirable that pupils use paper of 
uniform size. 
“Tn order to assure greater accuracy in the recording of the 
misspelled words, we ask that the pupils be drilled on the follow- 
ing list of words before they begin the work: 
to new hole foose 
too knew whole lose 
two seem brake principle 
there seam break principal 
their meet ate whether 
where meat, eight weather

as found by L. P. Ayres, and from the list of ‘One Hundred Spelling 
Demons’ as found by W. F. Jones. Many of the words occur in 
both lists. Hence, according to the findings of these studies, 
they are both commonly used and frequently misspelled. 
“After beginning the work it should be carried through with- 
out delay. We should greatly desire to have your returns in by 
December first as the work here cannot be started before all re- 
turns are in. 
“The data may be returned by Express C. O. D.” 
“DIRECTIONS FOR PUPILS 
“ Purpose 
“The purpose of this study is to find out what words are used 
in letter-writing so that we may be better able to tell what words 
we should first know how to spell. 
“Collecting of Letters 
“Each pupil is asked to collect from three to five letters, 
written in the State of Iowa by people over eighteen years of age. 
The letters collected by any one pupil should all be from people 
in the same occupation or profession, such as domestic or house- 
keeper, farmer, dry-goods merchant, druggist or drug clerk, teacher, 
minister, doctor, real estate man, milliner, etc. The letters should, 
as far as possible, be from different individuals in the same occupa- 
tion or profession; that is, not all from the same person. If you 
have difficulty in getting letters from your parents ask some other 
relative or friend to help you. No doubt some classmate can get 
more letters than he needs and help you out. Letters that you 
are not allowed to mark up or spoil can be copied word for word 
and the copy used for this purpose. 
“Misspelled Words 
“For misspelled words proceed as follows: Go over the letters 
and place a checkmark immediately over each word that is mis- 
spelled. If in doubt about the spelling consult a dictionary or 
write the doubtful words on a piece of paper and ask your teacher
-P-A-G-E-188
    182 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
about their spelling. Homonyms misused should be marked as 
misspelled. To illustrate: If the word pear or pare is used in 
speaking of a pair of shoes it is misspelled. If the word to or too 
is used in speaking of two men it is misspelled. Capitalization 
can be disregarded. 
“When ‘you have checked the misspelled words (if there are 
any) arrange them on a separate piece of paper in alphabetical 
order, in a vertical column. See any dictionary for alphabetical 
order. First write the word correctly and immediately following, 
on the same line, write the word as it was misspelled in the letter. 
Example: 
cabbage — cabage 
degrade — degrad 
enlarge — inlarge 
fought — faught 
“Recording All Words 
“On a large sheet of paper (about 8x10 inches) record all 
the words in columns. Use the long side of the paper for the top 
and write the words in vertical columns. By doing this you will 
be able to get more columns on one page and if you write small 
and distinctly you will be able to get all words beginning with the 
same letter in one column. There will be few words commencing 
with the letters j, k, q, v, x, y, z, and some others. Proceed as 
follows: First go through all the letters and draw a firm line 
through each word commencing with the letter a. Immediately 
after each line is drawn write the word on the large sheet of paper. 
Begin in the upper left hand corner and form the first column 
down the left side of the paper (the end or short side of the sheet). 
In this way go through all the letters and record all words com- 
mencing with the letter a, then all words commencing with 6, 
and so on through the alphabet. Keep your pencil well sharpencd 
and write small and distinctly so that you may be able to get all 
the words on one or two sheets of paper. Both sides can be used. 
The names of the parties need not be recorded, but all other words 
in the headings and closings of the letters should be included.
-P-A-G-E-189
SPELLING 183 
The single letters a, J, O, and all figures (numbers not written 
out) need not be recorded. Write all abbreviations as they occur 
in the letters. Any different spelling is to be considered as a dif- 
ferent word. For example: Such words as have and having, 
plan, plans and planning, and refer, referred, and referring, 
should be recorded as different words. When the same word 
occurs two or more times do not rewrite it but indicate its fre- 
quency by making a mark each time it occurs. If, for example, 
the word very occurs fourteen times, record it as follows: very 
TH THA 111-14. 
“Tn counting these words remember that the first mark was 
made when the word occurred the second time and that the word 
and marks must therefore be added together. Keep these marks 
close together so that they will not be in the way for the next col- 
umn of words. The marks can also be written immediately above 
the word. 
“When all words beginning with a have been recorded start 
a new column with the words commencing with b. In this way 
start a new column for each letter. By doing this instead of con- 
tinuing the first column you can add any word that may have 
been overlooked the first time. It is well to draw a line between 
the columns. You will find that you can pick out each succeed- 
ing list of words more easily and more rapidly because two or more 
successive words and even entire lines will soon be marked out. 
“Arranging Words in Alphabetical Order 
“You are now ready to rearrange and copy the words in ink 
as follows: On a new sheet of paper arrange the words in the 
same manner as before but in alphabetical order according to the 
first three letters of each word. You already have them arranged 
according to the first letter. After the first three letters the order 
can be disregarded.

“Note carefully the following: Before you begin to copy the 
words write (in ink) at the top of the first page the number of 
letters collected and the occupation or profession and sex of the 
persons who wrote and received the letters. Write this in the fol- 
lowing manner: 
“Five letters written by three doctors (two men and one 
woman). Three were written to a housekeeper (women) and two 
written to a druggist (man). It may be, of course, that your let- 
ters are from a farmer or dentist written to a grocer and tailor. 
Then your heading would probably appear as follows: Four letters 
written by two farmers (men). One was written to a grocer (man) 
and three to a tailor (man). You may have different occupations 
but they can always be recorded in the same manner. You will 
need to write this heading only once (on the first page) and your 
columns of words can be started immediately under it. You can 
tell from your first page whether any of the columns of words will 
be too long for your paper. If so, use the short side up; that is, 
write the heading at the top the short way and form the columns 
of words under it the long way. If none of the columns of words 
are too long, always use the long side of the paper for the top. 
“When these lines have been written on the first page proceed 
as follows: Number your first list of words 1, 2, 3, 4, ete., with a 
lead pencil in the order that they are to be placed (alphabetically). 
Then copy them (in ink) on the new sheet according to the order 
that they are numbered, drawing a line through each word before 
you copy it. In this list the number of times a word occurs can 
be indicated by the figures after the word. The word very 
would then be recorded as follows: very 14. This list of words 
and the list of misspelled words will be sent by your teacher or 
superintendent to the University of Iowa and will be published 
with your names later. It is necessary therefore that you do the 
work neatly. Write your name, grade, and town at the bottom 
on one side of each sheet of paper and fasten all your papers to- 
gether.

    “Grouping 
“Tf you have less than five letters analyzed in your list com- 
bine your work with that of some other pupil who has analyzed 
letters from people in the same calling or profession: that is, add 
the words of your two lists together and make a single list (in ink). 
It will not take long to do this after the words are alphabetically 
arranged. Each pupil can do half of this work or you can work 
together. This places a premium on getting five letters. If you 
can get as many as five letters in your own list you need not do 
this. If, however, one pupil has only three letters and another 
has four (from people in the same calling) combine the two into a 
list of seven. Where two lists are added together you need not 
write the letter again on this third combined list, but be sure to 
fasten the three lists together so that they will not come apart. 
Write both your names on this third list. The average pupil can 
do all the work in a few hours after the letters have been collected. 
“Always reread carefully that part of the directions which has 
to do only with the work which you are doing at the time. By 
doing this you will not become confused. 
“Summary 
“All papers sent in to the University should be neatly written 
in ink and should show the following: 
(1) All misspelled words and how they were misspelled. 
““(2) The number of letters analyzed in the list of words. 
“(3) Occupation and sex of the persons who wrote the letters. 
“(4) Occupation and sex of the persons who received the let- 
ters. 
“(5) All words should be alphabetically arranged. 
“(6) Where pupils have less than five letters two sets of papers 
should be combined into a single list. 
“(7) Your name, grade, and town should be on each separate 
sheet. 
“*(8) All papers of each pupil should be fastened together.” 
The lists were classified as professional; business; domestic, 
including homemakers and housekeepers, domestic servants and

employees; untrained nurses; personal; doctors; bankers; farm-. 
ers; automobile dealers; and miscellaneous. 
A total of 361,184 running words were compiled. The investi- 
gator reports that, on the whole, the work done by the pupils was 
very satisfactory. The lists so obtained were then compared with 
those made by other investigators. A total of 3105 words used 
five or more times was tabulated. 
In addition the misspelled words were also tabulated and these 
were found to include 238 words misspelled from 2 to 21 times 
each. Only about a dozen words showed any marked frequency 
of misspelling. These were: all right, coming, didn’t, don’t, for, 
haven’t, mamma, niece, thought, and until. These were missed 
ten times or over. The investigator draws the conclusion. that 
relatively few of the words tabulated in the total lists show any 
special spelling difficulty, 
§7—Gravep Lists 
(Study 7) 
Pryor* made comparisons of the lists obtained by Eldridge; 
W. F. Jones; Studley and Ware (a secondary source study); 
Woolfolk; in the Johnstown, Pa., course of study (also a second- 
ary source study); Ayres; Cook and O’Shea; and in the spellers 
of Chancellor and Hicks. As explained in the quotation just 
following, he obtained the common words, arranged them by 
grades, and gave them a trial in several schools. 
“After the lists had been selected, each one was numbered 
and all the words were checked off in a dictionary. The figure 
‘one’ was placed before every word in the dictionary which oc- 
curred in the Eldridge list. ‘Two’ was placed before each word 
that was found in the Jones list. The other ten lists were checked 
against the dictionary after the same fashion. Altogether, about

30,000 words were checked. By far the greater number occurred 
‘n only one list, a somewhat smaller number in two lists, and so 
on down to 121 that were common to 10 lists, 54 common to 11 
lists, and only 9, viz., again, any, believe, look, many, money, re- 
member, there, and through, that were found in all of the lists. 
“Tt was arbitrarily decided to include in the final list all words 
which occurred in at least six of the twelve lists examined; there 
were 1309 such words. To this number were added 169 words 
from the Ayres scale which were not among these 1309 words, 
making a total of 1478 words. 
“Arranging the words by grades presented a much greater 
difficulty than their selection. An examination of eight different 
graded lists, viz., the California and Johnstown spellers, Hicks’ 
Champion Spelling Book, and the Boston, New Orleans, Rich- 
mond, Smith, and Woolfolk lists revealed much difference of 
opinion as to where some of the words should be placed. Thus, 
accept was put in the 3d grade list by one author, in the 4th by a 
second, in the 5th by a third, in the 6th by three, and in the 7th 
by two. It appears among the 6th grade words in the appended 
list. Address, which appeared in three 5th, one 6th, and one 8th 
grade list, has been placed in the 5th grade of the appended list. 
Am, which was found in 1st, 2d, and 5th grade lists (most fre- 
quently in the last), was placed in the 5th grade. Each word in 
the entire list was assigned to the grade agreed upon by the 
majority of authors investigated, although in some cases the 
placing appeared to be pedagogically unsound. Some words, 
about whose location there was an exact division of opinion, were. 
placed in the lowest grade mentioned; others could be classified 
very readily because of the close agreement as to where they 
belonged. As was expected, most of the words fell in the primary 
grade lists, a considerably smaller number in the intermediate 
grade lists, and comparatively few in the grammar grade lists. 
The distribution was as follows: 343 words in the second grade, 
408 in the third, 216 in the fourth, 187 in the fifth, 157 in the sixth, 
131 in the seventh, and 38 in the eighth. 3 
“Obviously many of the words, such as am, are not properly

placed and therefore the list is not the best for school purposes. 
Lists are now being tried in the public schools of Antonito, Boulder, 
Carbondale, Central City, Cripple Creek, Del Norte, Fowler, 
Goldfield, Loveland, Manzanola, Matheson (rural school), 
Pueblo, and Victor, Colorado; Douglas, Wyoming; Hershey, 
Nebraska; and in one building in St. Louis, Missouri. Reports 
so far seem to indicate that there will be little alteration in the 
assignment of words to the several grades. It is hoped that a 
year’s use of the words in the actual school situation by capable, 
conscientious teachers will result in a highly satisfactory rearrange- 
ment. The writer invites the codperation of superintendents, 
principals, and teachers who would like to use the list and to 
assist in its revision.” 
Several other compilations of primary studies have been made 
and used as bases for grading spelling books by Starch and Mirick, 
Horne and Ashbaugh, and others. The method used by Horne 
and Ashbaugh is as follows: 
Words in the first grade had to show a frequency within the 
first 1,000, a spelling difficulty as evidenced by the accuracy with 
which children spelled these words without special instruction not 
greater than a certain degree, and occurrence in at least five of ten 
widely used first readers. Words to be placed in second or third 
grade were checked on the same three bases with a shift in the 
frequency and difficulty of the words and the use of second and 
third reader occurrence. Words in other grades were placed on 
bases of frequency of usage and difficulty of spelling, following the 
general principle that words of highest frequency should be taught 
first unless they were too difficult. 
§8—Spretiinc Errors in THE HicH ScHoou 
(Study 8) 
A. G. Capps collected errors made by all the students in a small 
high school in all written school work for eight months (the school 
year). In this time 956,000 words were written by 88 pupils 
and in these 3,388 errors in spelling occurred. Ten pupils made 
    
-P-A-G-E-195
ili SPELLING 189 
less than one error in ten pages of 150 words each, and one pupil 
made approximately three errors per page. The median pupil 
made one error per two pages, one-quarter of the pupils made 
less than one error in five pages, and one-fourth made more than 
eight errors in ten pages. 
The material was collected and tabulated as follows: 
“(a) Directions to Teachers 
“JT, Each pupil writing any school work either in school or 
at home should put in the upper left-hand corner of the first page 
of the composition his name, the date, and the number of words 
in the composition, as follows: 
  Date. cs. 2 08 
No. of words 
  “JJ. The teacher should underline with red ink or red pencil 
the incorrect words in all the written work of the students. (Formal 
spelling lessons are not included in these studies.) 
“TIT. After such use has been made of the papers as the teacher 
desires, they are to be finally returned unfolded, to the desk, and 
kept. 
“TV. Each set (or assignment) shall be kept separate from 
others. The papers in each set shall be arranged in strictly 
alphabetical order. On the top of each set shall be placed a sheet 
of paper on which is written the name of the course; the year, I, 
II, III, etc.; the section (if any), e.g., Eng. I, Sec. 1; the date 
on which the assignment was written, and the name of the teacher. 
Each assignment should be tied in a flat bundle with cord. Papers 
are not to be folded when bound in a bundle. 
“VY. These papers should be sent to the office on Monday 
mornings. 
“VI. In the case of loose-leaf note-books the teacher shall col- 
lect them once a week, and shall handle as other written work, 
except that a paper clip shall bind together the papers of any one 
student, and the material shall be returned to the teacher and the 
students as soon as the office is through with it.
-P-A-G-E-196
  
  190 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
“When note-books are not loose-leaf they are to be collected 
on the first and fifteenth of each month. The mistakes are to be 
marked and the books are to be sent to the office. They should 
be returned without delay. 
“VII. In spelling, abbreviations are supposed to have a period 
at the end; contractions have apostrophes. Disregard hyphens, 
syilabication and capital letters, except that if proper nouns are 
not capitalized they shall be counted as errors. } 
“Tn written work of foreign languages the student in counting 
_ the number of words used shall count only English words. Teachers 
shall mark errors only in these. 
“Simplified spellings should be accepted as correct only when 
a pupil uses them deliberately. 
“Tn mathematical work the student shall not count mathe- 
matical symbols; he shall count only full words and abbreviated 
words: 
“For instance, in the statement,‘Let « =No. of ac.,’ « and = 
are disregarded. 
“When you have examined your first set of papers please see 
the person making the study immediately concerning difficulties, 
if there are any. Do not mark a second set till you have seen him. 
If a new ruling is necessary he should write to Mr. Charters. 
Always refer cases of doubt to the person making the study. 
“VIII. At: the beginning of the school year, but only then, 
the students may be told about the study being made, and should 
be warned about always putting a period after abbreviations, and 
capital letters for proper nouns. If a student enters late he may 
be told these things privately. 
“Note: We are attempting to get at the normal spelling 
errors and teachers must, therefore, handle the spelling question 
just as they always have, giving no more attention to spelling 
with the class than usual. 
“(b) Directions for the Distribution of Error Slips 
“J, For preliminary distribution there should be kept five 
boxes, one for regular Freshmen, one for regular Sophomores, one
-P-A-G-E-197
  SPELLING 191 
for regular Juniors, one for regular Seniors, and one for irregular 
pupils. 
“TT. When the errors for each student have been written on 
the slips and the information tabulated upon the class record 
then the error slips shall be at once thrown into the appropriate 
box. Note: This means that an irregular in a Freshman class will 
have his errors thrown into the box of irregulars. 
“TI. For further distribution take the slips in one box and 
distribute these into 26 boxes, according to the first letter of the 
correct spelling — A, B, C, etc. Then take one of these boxes, 
for example A, and arrange all slips in strictly alphabetical order 
under A, etc. Each of these may then be tied into a bundle with 
a cord and preserved for future use. Each bundle should be put 
in a separate envelope appropriately marked. 
“(e) Directions for Keeping a Class Record 
  
  
  “A class record should be kept according to the plan above. 
Eng. I, Sec. I refers to Section I of Freshman English course. 
“Date (horizontal column) is that upon which the set of papers 
to be tabulated was written. 
“In the name column the students are to be arranged in 
strictly alphabetical order. 
“Tn the number column is to be set down the student’s number 
as described in later paragraphs. 
“In the columns marked thus, we qoc |, the number of 
errors made in a paper is given in the numerator, and the number 
of words in the paper is given in the denominator.

*“This record should be kept on loose-leaf ruled note paper, 
uniform in size for all the records. 
“At the end of the year there should be given by the teacher of 
this section a statement of how the spelling errors are handled 
with the class. 
“(q) Directions for Copying Errors 
“Errors shall be copied upon slips of paper of uniform size 
about 4 inches by 1 inch and shall contain the following informa- 
tion: 
  
6/24 Eng. 
aweful 
  “Explanation: the error is in the center; the correct spelling 
is in the upper left-hand corner; 6/24 refers to the date; Eng. 
refers to subject; I refers to Freshman course. 
“24 refers to number of the pupil, in a strictly alphabetical 
list according to classes — Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, Senior, 
with irregular students as a fifth group. 
“Regular Freshmen means students in the Freshman class 
who are spending their first year in this high school. They shall 
be numbered from 100 to 199. 
“Regular Sophomores means those who have credit for a full 
year’s work, are carrying a second full year’s work and are spend- 
ing their second year in this school. They shall be numbered from 
200 to 299. 
“Juniors similarly described shall be numbered from 300 to 399. 
“Seniors similarly described shall be numbered from 400 to 499. 
“All other students shall be called irregulars and shall be 
numbered from 500 on. 
“Tn case there are more than 100 students in any of these 
groups except the last, the same definition of groups should be' 
used, but other markings should be devised.” 
The errors were classified by years and subjects and by fre-

quency of occurrence. The list of errors occurring more than’ 
twice during the year was compared with the Ayres list, and it 
was found that 62 persisted into the high school and they were 
misspelled 497 times. These 62 words constitute 38 per cent of 
the words misspelled more than twice and 42 per cent of the 
total errors. The words misspelled more than nine times are 
the following: parliament (92), too (47), until (31), quantity 
(25), ete. 
“Misspelled 10 or more times.— Parliament (92), *too (47),

§1—Introduction 
     
             
     
    
               
       Several studies in language and grammar have been made as 
tabulated in the following lists. In so far as these have been 
published, references are found in Part I of the Sixteenth Year- 
book of the National Society for the Study of Education with the 
exception of W. Barnes’s study (15) which constitutes Vol. 3, No. 1, 
of the Bulletin of the Fairmont (W. Va.) State Normal School, 
and R. I. Johnson’s study (21). Mimeograph copies of the Hibbing 
study may be obtained by writing to W. J. Richardson, Public 
School, Hibbing, Minn. 
These studies all agree in the aim of discovering the errors of 
school children in language or grammar or both. The distinction 
between language and grammar lies in the fact that a grammatical 
error is one which can be referred to a rule in grammar for cor- 
rection. The use of “ketch” for “catch” is not strictly a-gram- 
matical error because it violates no rule of grammar, but rather 
one of pronunciation; while He don’t see me is a grammatical 
error since it breaks the rule of agreement of subject and predicate. 
The objectives of the studies are variously stated. Charters} 
and Miller say, “The purpose of this investigation was to find (1) 
what errors in the use of oral and written language forms violatin, 
rules of grammar were made by the children of the Kansas Cit 
elementary schools, (2) what rules in grammar were necessary i 
order to include and understand these items, (3) what items in thi 
present course of study in Kansas City were included but un 
necessary, and (4) what items should be included but wer 
omitted.”

  196 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
This, it will be noted, is a study concerned only with gramma- 
tical errors, but in both oral and written speech. Al! other 
studies listed collect only oral errors, except those of O. S. Thomp- 
son, W. Barnes, and H. D. Fillers, while seven collect grammatical 
errors only, and five collect errors in both language and grammar. 
Some of the investigators contend that the only objective 
which justifies the study of grammar is that of correction of 
errors; but for purposes of investigation it is necessary merely 
to assume this objective, not to defend it. This is discussed by 
the writer in the following quotation.* 
“There are at least five points of view from which the problem 
of determining the minimal elements in a course of study in gram- 
mar for the elementary grades may be attacked. Each has its 
own technique and all produce curriculums which have gram- 
matical elements in common, but in which there are different 
elements. 
“The five points of view referred to are the following: (1) 
discipline of mental activities, (2) a knowledge of the structure’ 
of thought as exhibited in the sentence, (3) the understanding} 
of literature, (4) the improvement of speech through the artistic 
use of grammatical information, and (5) the improvement of 
speech through the elimination of errors. Five differs from four| 
in this respect. Four seeks to raise speech which is grammatically 
correct to the plane of rhetorical effectiveness through a knowl- 
edge of grammatical elements which may become tools with 
which to manipulate the expression of ideas. Five aims to study] 
the errors of speech and present a body of information which} 
may be used to make the language as spoken, grammatical: 
accurate. 
“The methods of investigation utilized in each case hav 
elements in common. The first essential is to analyze the te: 
in order to tabulate the elements and arrange these in the orde: 
of their importance. The arrangement in order of importance i 
necessary because in practical use it is usually found that th 
element. of time for study makes it impossible to teach all th

-P-A-G-E-203
  LANGUAGE AND GRAMMAR 197 
items in any such list. In the case of the discipline of mental 
activities, a psychological analysis of mental activities must be 
made in order to obtain a list and in the list the function of each 
item and its bearings must be determined in order to evaluate 
the elements and designate their relative importance. In the case 
of the use of grammar as a means of studying the structure of 
thought, a logical or psychological study of thought processes 
and a philological study of the sentence must be made and the 
elements evaluated. In the study of grammar as an aid to the 
appreciation of written thought it is necessary to make an ex- 
haustive examination of the use of grammatical forms, to eval- 
uate these forms, and to arrange them in order of importance. 
A study of the elevating of speech from grammatical accuracy 
to rhetorical effectiveness necessitates a study of the technique 
of rhetorically effective writers and speakers in the manipulation 
of grammatical forms and rules. The forms and rules so manipu- 
lated must, as in the case of the others, be evaluated and arranged 
in order of importance. In the study of grammar for the elimina- 
tion of errors, it is apparent that the first step is to ascertain 
the rules which are broken and to determine their relative im- 
portance. 
“The second step in the procedure is the designation and evalu- 
ation of those grammatical elements which will give assistance 
in reaching the objectives discerned from each point of view. 
Such lists of elements or curriculums will in all probability have 
many common items; but on the other hand, some will have 
elements not found in others, and probably in no two curriculums 
will the items be arranged in the same relative order of impor- 
tance. For instance, if training in delicacy of discrimination is 
one element in the list of mental activities, we should find the 
stress laid upon those fine points of grammar which would give 
practice in discrimination of shades of meaning; or among those 
elements which are used in attaining rhetorical effectiveness, 
participial constructions and infinitives would have a position 
of high honor, while in the use of correction of errors as a basis 
of selection, we should find the participles and infinitives lightly

regardeA and the simpler tense form of verbs and cases of pro- 
nouns evaluated highly.” 
§2—Murnops or CoLLECTING AND CLASSIFYING 
In all the studies except that of E. D. Randolph, who obtained 
stenographic reports, and of Barnes, who collected at leisure in 
person, the oral material was collected by teachers. The detailed 
form used in Kansas City, Bonham, Columbia, Hibbing, Detroit, 
and Pittsburgh, is as follows except that where oral errors, only, 
were collected, the portion referring to written work was omitted, 
and when both language and grammar were studied the term 
“errors in grammar” was changed to “errors in language.” 
“The following directions for collecting both oral and written 
work were given to the teachers: | 
“Written Language 
“Aim of Investigation: To find what errors in grammar chil- 
dren naturally make in writing when not corrected by the teacher. 
“1, Who shall collect written work. All teachers of grades 
III to VII inclusive shall hand in to the principal the written work 
of their pupils. : 
“2. What written work shall not be handed in. No dictated 
work or work copied from books or blackboards shall be handed 
in to the principal. No work which is rewritten after corrections 
have been made by teacher or the class shall be handed in to the 
principal by the teacher. 
“3. Subjects of written work. Written work ordinarily done 
in the regular order of school work should be included. No 
special effort to get written work should be made, except that if 
possible the pupils should select or be assigned once a week some 
topic upon which they will write with great freedom and at some 
length. If they write freely and at some length, they will reveal 
their errors, which is the desired end. 
“4, Form. (a) Any kind of paper may be used. (b) Ink or 
pencil may be used. That which will give greatest freedom in 
expression should be used. (c) No unusual mention should be

              made of neatness or legibility. (d) At the top of each page each 
pupil should write the name, the school, the grade, the room, and 
the date. 
“5. How to bundle the papers. When the teacher has fin- 
ished with a set of papers, the set should be bound together 
securely with a cord, and in a conspicuous place on the bundle 
should be given the name of the school, the grade, the room, and 
the date. Each set should be bound by itself in one bundle, and 
on November 21 all the bundles should be bound securely into 
one large bundle, conspicuously marked as to school, grade, and 
room, and sent to the principal’s office. Along with this bundle 
should be sent, in an envelope, the names of all pupils in the room, 
arranged alphabetically by sex together with age in years and 
months on November 21. The principal will then forward all 
the bundles to the superintendent’s office upon the first visit of 
the trucks after November 21. The principal should, if conven- 
ient, fasten the room bundles together, marking each large bundle 
with the name of the school. 
“6. Length of period for collection. Papers written between 
October 27 and November 21, inclusive, should be handed in. 
“Note.—Children must not be told that their papers are being 
collected for grammatical errors, nor should anything be done to 
make them unusually careful or to make them unnatural or stilted. 
If papers are corrected or recopied, the rewritten work must not 
be handed in, but the original work must be. No corrections should 
be made on the original paper. 
“Oral Language 
“Aim of Investigation: To find what errors in grammar chil- 
dren naturally make in talking when not corrected by the teacher. 
“1. Who shall collect the oral errors. All teachers of grades 
II to VII, inclusive, and principals shall collect all oral errors in 
grammar made in the schoolroom and around the school building 
by children of any age. 
“2. Time to be spent in collecting errors. From eight o’clock 
Monday morning, November 17, to four o’clock Friday evening, 
November 21.

“3. Details of tabulation. (a) Carry a. notebook constantly 
for these five days and jot down every grammatical error made 
orally in your presence. If the same error occurs more than once, 
either with or without the use of the same words, note it each 
time it occurs. (b) Copy each error as nearly as possible with the 
exact words used. (c) In copying the errors from the notebooks 
to hand in to the principal, each error should be written in ink 
on a separate piece of school paper 1 inch by 4 inches in size. 
This will save the office much copying work. (d) Seal all these in 
one or more large envelopes, writing on the outside of each en- 
velope ‘Oral errors:reported by. .............0...0 0000s of the 
Meee aI school, grade .............?. (Name of teacher.) 
(e) The principal will bind all these envelopes into one package 
and conspicuously mark ‘Oral errors from ............ school,’ 
and send as soon as possible to the superintendent’s office.” 
Meek (12) modified this method by having his teachers make 
a preliminary collection of errors for a short period. These were 
then classified and the classification re-submitted to the teachers 
to note errors when they occurred and record the frequency of 
occurrence of each class. 
After the oral errors were collected, the classification was, in 
the W. W. Charters and E. Miller study (10), allowed to grow 
of its own accord. The method of listing all syntactical rules 
found in grammar and checking against these might have been 
used as is necessary in some obscurely delimited subjects like 
sociology or economics; but it seemed objectively better to let the 
classes grow, although it is quite apparent that one who has 
studied grammar is likely to follow unconsciously the grammatical 
rules which he knows. Those studies which followed this study 
(Bonham, Columbia, Detroit, Hibbing, and Pittsburgh) used the 
Kansas City classification as a basis. The method of classification 
used by the rest of the investigators is not stated in their reports. 
When the written material in the Charters and Miller study 
was examined, the oral list was used as a basis and additional 
classes grew as the material was read. Difficulties were met with 
here because some items which the tabulators later used were
-P-A-G-E-207
  LANGUAGE AND GRAMMAR 201 
omitted from the early reading — the capitalization of proper 
nouns, in particular —and a separate study of this had to be 
made. The later study of Betz and Marshall is much more 
completely classified. 
§3—Mersops or Dertvinc GRAMMAR 
When the classes of errors had been determined in the Charters 
and Miller study the problem shifted to that of determining upon 
the basis of these errors the grammatical rules which should be 
taught. It was necessary first to change the form from the state- 
ment of the error to the statement of the rule broken. For in- 
stance, the simple statement of error, “Subject of the verb not in 
the nominative,” had to be changed to a statement of the rule 
broken, namely, ‘“‘T'he subject of a verb is in the nominative case.” 
In a more difficult example where the error read “Wrong forms of 
noun and pronoun,” fifteen rules had to be listed. This procedure 
was carried out for all the errors and resulted in a list of about sixty 
rules which were found to have been broken by the children. 
At this point it was discovered that the children, if they were 
to understand and use the rules, must be taught certain gram- 
matical definitions. For instance, to undrestand the rule The 
subje.t of a verb is in the nominative case, a knowledge of subject 
and predicate and, therefore, of the sentence was necessary. In 
addition, a knowledge of subject involves acquaintance with noun 
and pronoun. Nominative case includes case and the nominative 
| case in pronouns, and predicate involves the verb. 
Each of the 29 classes of error was treated in this way, and 
finally a point was reached at which there lay before the investi- 
gators a complete list of the grammatical rules and definitions 
necessary to correct the errors of the children of Kansas City. 
This material was then classified under parts of speech as found 
in $4 of this chapter, Result No. 5. 
§4—_ResuLts 
1. All the inves igators agree in the finding that errors in 
verbs are most frequent, constituting, as they do, around sixty 
 
-P-A-G-E-208
  202 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
per cent of the grammatical errors, except Randolph, whose sten- 
ographic reports show the verbs to be about ten. 
2. Because it is a well-known fact that when errors become 
very common they cease to be thought serious and in course of 
time are accepted as good form, the query naturally arises as to 
whether or not the most common are considered to be the most 
serious. Obviously, the most common are serious from the point 
of view of frequency, but they may not attach so deep a stigma to 
the user as do some much less common errors. 
With this in mind the teachers of Pittsburgh were asked to 
list the ten errors which each considered to be the worst. These 
were compiled. The relative frequency with which each was 
mentioned by teachers and the proportional percentage which each 
was of the total “worst list” was compiled. This percentage 
was compared with similar percentages of frequency of occurrence 
of the error. It was found in the case of 41 specific items that 
the correlation between the frequency of mention by teachers as 
being one of ten worst errors, with frequency of occurrence was 
.63 by the Spearman Foot rule. This is fairly high and sug- 
gests that, in general, the gravity follows the frequency when 
measured in this rough way. 
The twelve errors in which there was the widest divergence 
between frequency of occurrence and frequency of mention by 
the teachers may be d:vided into two classes. Five errors were, 
in the opinion of the teachers, much worse than they were frequent. 
The use of was for were was ranked 30.5 in the frequency of error 
list, but in the teachers’ opinion was second to worst; learn for 
teach (18) frequency, (36.5) gravity; that_there (4), (15.5); double 
comparatives (26), (34.5), and-them: there (20), (27). In seven 
extreme cases the reverse was true. The teachers did not think 
the errors so bad as they were frequent. Ain’t got ranked twenty- 
eighth in seriousness in teachers’ opinions, but ninth in frequency 
of occurrence; give for gave (31.5), (15.5); zs for are (16), (6); 
misuse of me as in It is me (22.5), (14); wrong sequence of pro-— 
nouns as in Hveryone must do their work (36), (28); come for came 
(18), (11); and will for shall (31.5), (24.5).

This table should be read as follows: The error, “The subject 
of the verb not in the nominative case,’ constitutes 4 per cent of 
the total of 5883 errors reported in Kansas City, 4 per cent of 
the 11,207 errors reported in Detroit, and so forth. Any type of 
error given 0 percentage appeared with a percentage of less than .5. 
Randolph* (14), in his stenographic report of the speech of 
children, lists 1412 errors in sentence structure out of a total of 
2954 errors. None of these are collected from teachers in the 
other studies. This is a significant difference and, while incom- 
plete answers may have constituted a very large part of Ran- 
dolph’s list, other errors not belonging to this class were present. 
It is, therefore, quite certain that the stenographic report is 
superior to collection by teachers.

course of study based on the errors of Kansas City children may 
be summarized as follows:

(d) The extent to which the parsing will be carried should

Barnes (15), in general, agrees with the foregoing items. Dif- 
ferences are as follows: He adds collective nouns, although the 
one who listens to a speaker can only infrequently tell that he has 
made a mistake in number. He also adds appositives in nouns, 
none of which were noted in the Kansas City study. He also adds 
the plural of demonstrative adjectives, which was an oversight 
in the Kansas City study. He adds gerunds but omits negatives 
and syntactical redundance, which are possibly not. strictly 
grammatical in nature. 
6. An examination of these lists shows that grammar is 
greatly simplified as to both the complexity of the sentences used 
and the narrow range of facts to be learned. Much of the diffi- 
culty of grammar is eliminated. Unusual tenses, gerundives, 
infinitive constructions, and most of the mood forms are among 
those in which mistakes are infrequently made or not made at all. 
In the Kansas City study it was found that the following 
could be omitted from the course of study which was in operation 
in the schools at the time of the investigation: the exclamatory 
sentence, the conjunction, the appositive, the nominative of 
address, the nominative by exclamation, the objective comple- 
ment, the adverbial objective, the indefinite pronoun, the objec- 
tive used as a substantive, the classification of adverbs, the noun 
clause, the conjunctive adverb, the retained objective, the moods 
(except, possibly, the subjunctive of to be), the infinitive (except 
the split infinitive), the objective subject, the participle (except 
 
-P-A-G-E-214
  208 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
the definition and the present and past forms), the nominative 
absolute, and the gerund. 
It is evident that some of the items in this list could not have 
been revealed by this method. For instance, one cannot tell from 
reading whether or not the writer should have used an exclamation 
mark to convey the meaning he intended. Again, the material 
read did not happen to include any cases of the nominative of 
address where the comma was not used correctly; and, in fact, 
the use of the nominative of address was very slight. The oral 
sentences reported by the teachers did not include noun clauses; 
and the children’s themes which were read seldom used the 
complex sentence, the preference seeming to be for the compound 
sentence. 
It is quite clear that a much more simple set of sentences could 
be used for analysis and parsing than are presented to children 
when it is necessary for them to learn to analyze and parse sentences 
involving subtle rules in grammar which they do not naturally 
break, 
7. W. J. Richardson (19) and Charters (Pittsburgh) (21) 
classified the errors by grades, to see what natural eliminations 
occurred during progress through the grades. Clearly, no absolute 
standard could be set up, because certain errors may be stressed 
more heavily and, therefore, noticed more sharply by teachers 
in the upper grades. But, if a type of error has completely 
disappeared, the fact is of some significance. None such, how- 
ever, were noticed except the use of quite childish incorrect 
forms of the past and perfect tenses; and in many cases, due to 
the reason just mentioned, some errors increased in number or 
total per cent. ‘

City, Mo., in which the former wrote 50,371 words and the latter 
32,693 words on elective themes written upon for fifteen minutes 
during three successive class exercises at the beginning of the 
year. On the first day of the three the following instructions 
were given to the pupils: ‘Tell about any incident suggested by 
(1) ‘Missing the Train’, (2) ‘A Day’s Journey’, or (8) ‘A Lucky 
Mistake’.”’ On the second day the instructions were: “Describe 
(1) a person you know, (2) any scene that has impressed you, or (8) 
a department store during a busy hour.” The instructions on the 
third and last day were: “Explain (1) how to use a dictionary, 
(2) how you would spend a vacation at home to the best advantage, 
or (3) your ideas of a Freshman’s responsibilities.” 
Following is a statement of methods of scoring and tabulation: 
“1. The category of error. — In tabulating the errors, it was 
necessary to decide upon some sort of classification. First, a 
temporary working list of errors was made. This was modified 
from time to time as new kinds of mistakes appeared in the 
papers, until, finally, when the tabulation was completed, it was 
found that forty-seven different headings had been utilized. 
These forty-seven kinds, however, grouped themselves by the 
laws of natural relationship into fourteen major classes, or types — 
if the inevitable miscellaneous group can be said to constitute a 
type. 
“Only technical errors, of course, were included in the tabula- 
tion: errors that relate to the ‘mechanics of writing,’ such as 
errors in grammar, spelling, the use of the apostrophe, etc. The 
thought of the sentences and paragraphs was not criticized, unless 
by some violation of grammatical principle it was rendered 
ambiguous or otherwise confusing in meaning. Furthermore, no 
doubtful errors were tabulated. Anything about which there is a 
common difference of opinion, such as the observance of some of 
the mooted rules of punctuation or the use of simplified spelling, 
was omitted from the study. 
“2. Distribution of errors according to kinds. — With the 
foregoing list as a basis, all the errors in the 83,064 words of 
manuscript were carefully classified.”

            Table IV, which is compiled from data given in the investi-

case in pronouns were found in the 2160 errors made by high school 
Freshmen. This class of error ranked fourteenth in frequency 
among the errors made by these students and occurred at the 
rate of two per ten thousand words. The college Freshmen made 
two mistakes of this kind out of a total of 787 errors. These two 
were fourteenth in order of frequency of error and occurred at , 
the rate of one (approximately) per ten thousand words in’ the 
32,693 words written.

  LANGUAGE AND GRAMMAR 211 
The percentage ranking compares closely with those found in 
the study of grammar in the written work of the sixth and seventh 
grades in Kansas City (p. 194). 
Johnson finds that the relative rankings of errors by frequency 
of occurrence do not vary greatly as between high school and 
college Freshmen. That is to say, the most frequent high school 
error was likely to be the most frequent in college. But the 
columns marked 3 in the table, which have been added by 
the writer, show that in errors per ten thousand words the fre- 
quency has materially decreased during the four years of the high 
school. The totals have decreased from 43 to 24 or nearly 45 
per cent. Most noticeable improvement is found in ability to 
use good sentence structure,.the decrease in errors being 75 per 
cent, and in ability to spell, with a decrease of about 50 per cent. 
The only marked increase is in punctuation, which is explained 
on specific accidental grounds. 
Generally speaking, if 150 words are counted as a page, the 
total number of errors per page found in the high schoo] Fresh- 
men’s themes is about 6.4, in the college Freshmen’s themes about 
3.6. The errors in spelling run about two and one per page re- 
spectively. Spelling and punctuation together constitute 42 per 
cent of the high school Freshmen errors and about 39 per cent 
of the errors of college Freshmen. 
From the data, by an unstated method, Johnson derives the 
following order of teaching emphasis upon the different classes 
of error, the first being most important: 
(1) Mistakes in capitalization. (2) Mistakes in the use of the 
apostrophe. (3) Mistakes in punctuation. (4) Mistakes in the 
use of adjectives and adverbs. (5) Mistakes in spelling. (6) 
Mistakes in pronouns, not including case. (7) Careless omissions 
and repetitions. (8) Mistakes in the use of verbs. (9) Mistakes 
in the use of prepositions and conjunctions. (10) Sentence mean- 
ing not clear. (11) Sentence structure not grammatical. (12) 
Mistakes in the use of quotation marks. (13) Mistakes in the 
cases of pronouns.

MATHEMATICS 
(Studies 23-30) 
§1—InTRODUCTION 
In examining the studies in the field of mathematics, the 
reader’s attention is called particularly to the following points: 
1. Except for the item of instructional order, four of the 
studies analyze the mathematical material in sufficient detail to 
permit of the construction of a limited course of study. Wilson 
gives the Jimits of complexity that need to be taught in connec- 
tion with the operations which were found to be necessary in 
his material. The same is true of the studies of Williams, Calla- 
way, and Charters. These studies show not only that an oper- 
ation such as addition is used, but also that 90 or 95 per cent 
of the cases of addition involve the adding of four addends of 
three places. This detailed information is significant because it 
is quite one thing to show that business men believe that ad- 
dition should be taught, or that superintendents are convinced 
that more attention must be paid to addition, and quite another 
to be able to limit the range of addition to operations of definite 
complexity, beyond which it is relatively immaterial to give 
practice. 
2. A wide variety of classification of the material is illus- 
trated. Mathematical operations constitute a convenient method 
of classifying the information for technical purposes, and this is 
used by all the investigators; but, in addition, the material is 
classified according to other criteria. Monroe and Wilson com- 
pare the frequency of the occurrence of problems dealing with 
occupations, with the lists of occupations used in the Federal 
Census. As has already been noted, classifications have been 
212 
 
-P-A-G-E-219
| MATHEMATICS 213 
made according to the magnitude of numbers and the range of | 
complexity of the operations. 
3. Methods of deriving service mathematics are illustrated. 
Textbooks dealing with the subjects of chemistry and clothing 
have been read and their exercises worked out. In doing this 
the investigators have described all the concepts and operations 
which are mathematical in nature. This enables them to deter- 
mine with considerable exactness how much mathematics it is 
necessary for students to know in order successfully to understand 
the texts and work the exercises. 
4. Descriptions of method are stated in detail in several 
studies. Monroe’s study and Wilson’s second study are particu- 
larly full. Williams’s statement, while short, involves simple 
elements and is sufficiently exact to be followed and verified. 
As has been noted in Chapter XIII, §2, detailed descriptions of 
methods are particularly necessary at this stage of the science 
of curriculum construction. Only by recording methods is it 
possible to avoid duplication and secure refinement of the pro- 
cedure.

G. M. Wilson* addressed a questionnaire to the business 
men of Connersville to get their advice concerning the content 
of arithmetic. The questionnaire follows. Interspersed among 
the items are the conclusions drawn from the returns. 
“ “QUESTIONNAIRE TO Business MEN 
“ «The teachers are working with me on the problem of mak- 
ing changes in our course of study in arithmetic, as suggested 
by advanced educational thought and the commercial progress 
of our community. I desire the assistance and support of the 
best thought of our business community. You are therefore

“1. At present the school time in the grades is divided 
approximately as follows:—Reading, 26 per cent, Arithmetic, 
16 per cent, Language, 12 per cent, History 11 per cent, Geogra- 
phy, 8 per cent, Spelling, 7 per cent, Music, 6 per cent, Drawing, 
6 per cent, Writing 4 per cent, Physiology, 4 per cent. 
“ ‘Toes this appeal to you as a proper division of school 
time in the grades?’ 
“The replies indicate a general agreement with the above 
division of school time in grades. The exceptions are, calling 
for less time in drawing and more time in spelling and writing. 
The arguments given are based upon the fact that our graduates 
do not write and spell as well as they should. This we do not 
deny, nor do we attempt to defend it. The fact remains, however, 
that pupils of to-day write better and spell better than formerly. 
This is proved by every actual test that has been made, the 
Springfield test being most conclusive. The studies of Corman 
and Rice on spelling show that extra time on spelling does not} 
improve the results. Their studies are exhaustive and involve| 
tests including thousands of pupils, and their conclusions are 
therefore more or less authoritative. 
“*9. Stated differently, English receives 49.27 per cent of 
the school time in the grades; the three R’s receive 65.24 per 
cent; the fundamentals (the three R’s plus geography and his 
tory) receive 86.09 per cent; the special subjects (physiology, 
music, and drawing) receive 13.91 per cent. 
“<Does your experience suggest any changes of emphasis?’ 
“No points are mentioned here which are not included in on

««¢3. Following are some of the topics we, as boys, studied 
in arithmetic in the grades. Check (¥) the topics for which 
you have had considerable use during the past six months. Cross 
(x) the topics for which you have had little or no use during 
the last six months:— 
Troy weight Compound fractions 
Apothecaries’ weight Foreign exchange 
Longitude and time Compound proportion 
The surveyor’s table True discount 
The greatest common divisor Cases 2 and 3 in percentage 
The least common multiple Compound interest 
Complex fractions Partial payments 
Cube root Partnership 
“*May some of these topics be omitted from our arithmetic 
work without material Joss? What ones?’ 
“The sentiment of the replies is strongly in favor of the 
elimination of the subjects indicated above. The G. C. D., 
L. C. M., and complex fractions failed to get any support. Cube 
root, compound proportion, cases in percentage, and the sur- 
veyor’s table received only the meagerest sort of support. All 
told there were thirty-four votes for and seventy-seven against 
these topics. The reasons given for eliminating these subjects are 
that they have no practical value to most people, and that the 
time is needed upon the fundamentals. These reasons appeal to 
me as getting at the truth of the matter. 
“<«4, Following are some of the topics we did not study in 
arithmetic as boys:— 
Saving and loaning money 
Mortgages 
Modern banking methods 
Building and Joan associations 
Keeping simple accounts 
Investing money 
Bonds as investments

Real estate as investment (cheap rentals, good residence 
property, business blocks, or farm lands—as investments). 
Marks of a good investment. (It is estimated that the get- 
rich-quick concerns fleece the American people out of 
$60,000,000 a year.) 
Taxes, levies, public expenditures 
Profits in different lines of business 
Life insurance as protection and investment 
“ «Check (¥ ) any of the above that appeal to you as worthy 
of a place in present-day arithmetic work.’ 
“Almost without exception every topic in the above was 
checked by everyone replying. This was indeed a surprise, and 
a pleasant one. Much of the work on these topics will necessarily 
be handled as informational work. The figuring involved will 
be simple and will center in the fundamental processes and per- 
centage. We are certainly glad to have the approval of the busi- 
ness men of the community upon the work attempted along 
these lines. 
«5. Connersville is developing important industrial and com- 
mercial interests. To what extent should those interests have 
an influence in shaping a course of study for our schools, especially 
the course in arithmetic?’ 
“The sentiment is almost unanimous that the schools and the 
course of study should take into consideration the industrial and 
commercial interests of our community. 
“<6. Suggest some feasible plan of bringing the school into 
closer relations with the industrial, commercial, and business 
interests of our community. Give some figures or problems fro 
your own business.’ 
“Few of those replying attempted suggestions as to feasibl 
plans for accomplishing the purpose indicated above.”

This questionnaire would have yielded more valuable returns 
if the topics in arithmetic had not been divided and if a system of 
underscoring had been used to indicate increased attention, slight 
attention, and elimination. For instance, it would have been 
possible to double-underscore increased attention, single-under- 
score slight attention, and cross out eliminated topics. The 
difficulty with the present form is that there is no opportunity 
to indicate elimination or slight attention in the second group, or 
added attention to the items of the first group. 
These returns were tabulated, showing the reaction of the 
superintendents (1) of cities, (2) of counties, and (3) of cities of 
100,000 and over. The tables were thrown into percentage and 
graphic form. The material shows that the superintendents of 
the larger cities are inclined to favor more elimination than are 
the superintendents of the smaller cities. Tabulation by districts 
shows that there is a slight difference between the North and 
the South, but this difference is not greater than between the 
North Central and North Atlantic States. 
Tables were made to show that the amount of time spent in 
minutes per week on arithmetic recitations varies from none to 
450 in the first grade, and from none to 450 in the eighth grade. 
The percentage of time given all the way through the grades was 
shown to run in the city schools from a median of 43 per cent in 
the first grade to 53 per cent in the third grade, with a decreasing 
amount of time spent upon drill through the grades to the eighth. 
The study shows that there is a normal tendency on the part 
of half of the superintendents in favor of either eliminating or 
lessening the attention to be given to certain subjects in arith- 
metic, such as alligation, cube root, unreal fractions, progression, 
and certain obsolete tables such as folding paper, surveyor’s 
measure, etc. It reveals also an overwhelming total in favo 
of increased emphasis on the four fundamentals, and a strong dis: 
position towards increased emphasis on social and economic ap: 
plications in arithmetic. It is recommended in the study that 
the 50 per cent of the cities spending the most time on arithmeti 
reduce this to the amount being expended by the 50 per cen‘

spending the least time. It is further suggested that the median 
percentage of recitation time given over to drill in each grade be 
adopted as a standard until scientific investigations have proved 
this to be an error. 
§4—ProBiems IN Four TEXTBOOKS 
(Study 25) 
Monroe* in a preliminary study of the economy of time in 
arithmetic utilizes four textbooks as material for study. 
“The investigation described in this report is based upon the 
assumption that the primary purpose of teaching arithmetic in 
the elementary school is to equip the pupil (1) with that knowledge 
of facts, principles, and relationships existing between quantities, 
etc., which is needed to decide what arithmetical operations are to 
be performed in solving valuable practical problems; and (2) with 
the skills which are necessary to perform these operations. A 
practical problem is defined as a problem which occurs in the 
course of a human activity. Human activity is not restricted to 
vocations or occupations, but, as the following pages show, four 
major divisions of human activities have been recognized: (1) 
occupational activities, (2) activities of the home, (3) personal 
activities, and (4) activities of school children. This definition of 
a ‘practical problem’ has no reference to the economic or social 
importance of the problem It simply means that in order to be 
classed as ‘practical’ a problem must be one that occurs in some 
human activity. 
“One major purpose actuated this study, namely, to secure a 
list of the arithmetical problems which arise in human activities 
and which possess a sufficient degree of utilitarian or socializing 
value to justify their being designated as minimal essentials of 
purpose. At this time it is possible to give only the method of 
investigation and certain tentative observations on the data which 
have been collected. 
*Part I, Sixteenth Yearbook, pp. 111-127, W. 8. Monroe. 
 
-P-A-G-E-226
      220 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
“In determining this list of problems the plan has been, first, 
to secure as complete a list as possible, and, second, to determine 
which problems possess sufficient value to be designated as minimal 
essentials of purpose. In accomplishing the first purpose prob- 
lems have been collected from textbooks and other available 
sources. Since the final list is to consist only of problems which 
arise in human activities, problems which did not contain some 
clue to identify them with a human activity have been rejected. 
For example, the following problems probably do not occur in any 
human activity: 
“880 times the area of Porto Rico is 2,800 sq. mi. less 
than that of the United States. Find the area of Porto Rico. 
“One year Montana produced 30,820,000 pounds of 
wool. If this was 2.17 of the total production of the United 
States that year, how much did all other states produce? 
“Problems such as the following do occur in several human 
activities, but the statements of the problems contain nothing to 
identify them with any particular activity. For this reason such 
problems have been rejected: 
“The sides of a triangular field are respectively 236.7 
ft., 257.9 ft., and 248.4 ft. What is the perimeter? 
“The plan of this study involves the assumption that the 
problems possessing sufficient value to be included in the list of 
‘minimal essentials of purpose’ are to be found in our present 
arithmetic texts and in other accessible printed problem lists. The 
validity of this assumption cannot be tested until the examination 
of texts and other printed lists of problems is completed, but the 
study has been carried far enough to show that the list which is' 
obtained will be far more complete than is now found in any one 
textbook. It should also be noted that since our purpose is to 
obtain a list of minimal essentials of purpose, all problems that 
do not possess a sufficient degree of value will be excluded from 
this final list. Since this is the case, the fact that unimportant 
problems are found in the textbooks will not influence the fin: 
list. 
“The writer recognizes that the ideal procedure would be t    
    
        
    
      
        
-P-A-G-E-227
MATHEMATICS 221 
make a complete survey of activities to ascertain what arith- 
metical problems exist and the frequency of their occurrence. 
However, the plan now being followed was chosen because, it was 
felt to be far more feasible. It is not believed that the assump- 
tion which it involves will place serious limitations upon the 
results, but after the sources of problems now being used have been 
exhausted, the writer proposes to test the validity of the assump- 
tion and its influence upon the final list.” 
The problems were classified and sub-classified_first_on_the 
basis of occupational activities, activities of the home, personal 
activities, and activities of school children. This classification into 
four groups is based on the investigator’s own opinion and is 
adopted because it seems to him to suit his purposes. The sub- 
classification of occupational activities followed the Federal Census 
and took cognizance of the relative importance of each in terms 
of the number of people engaged in it. 
The problems are further classified under arithmetical types 
or difficulties which are included in the solution of each. The 
two following problems present different difficulties: (1) A family 
buys a quart of milk a day at 8c. a quart. How much is its milk bill 
in a month of 30 days? (2) How much will be left of $1 after 
paying for 8 pounds of sugar at 614 cents a pound? The first 
involves multiplication of integers while the second involves mul- 
tiplication of fractions and subtraction. These are then listed as 
different types. 
With these classes, social and arithmetical, in mind, the 
practical problems of the four books were listed. From the study 
it was possible to make two comparisons. First, the numerical 
importance of the occupations could be determined from the 
census and the number of types of problems could be determined 
for each with observance of absence or great frequency in each 
case. Second, the frequency of problems of each technical type 
could be ascertained. This frequency was quite interesting 
because it appeared that 511 type problems occurred only once, 
and 140 only twice, out of a total of 1023 types; while on the 
other hand, one type occurred 434 times and a second 256 times 
  4

out of a total of 5936. And, indeed, 18 per cent, or approximately 
one out of five, of all the problems listed were from the following 
types: 
“At $1.75 each, what will 17 books cost? (Multiplication.) 
A man borrowed $250 on January 15, at 6%. How much was the 
interest on October 15? (Simple interest.) If I borrow $50, at 
6%, on February 8 of this year, how much will be due on May 2 
on next year? (Amount.) What change should be received from 
a five-dollar bill in paying a monthly bill for 30 qts. of milk at 8c a 
quart, and 5 jars of cream at 15c a jar? (Multiplication.) What 
is the cost of 50 gals. of paint at 6624 cts. a gallon, and 41 gals. of 
varnish at $1.25 a gallon? (Multiplication of fractions and 
addition.) 
“Conclusions 
“1. Out of a total of 1023 types of practical problems found 
in four textbooks, 720, or 71 per cent, occur in occupational 
activities. 
“2. No problems have been found to assign to a large number 
of the specified occupations. These occupations make up 55 per 
cent of the total working population. If further research does 
not reveal a considerable number of occupational problems which 
come under these heads, a limitation of arithmetic as a vocational 
subject will be obvious. 
“3. The authors of four textbooks are far from being in 
agreement on the type problems of arithmetic. Only one author 
out of four has recognized 511 out of 1023 type problems, and 
140 type problems have received the recognition of only two 
authors out of four. 
“4. Tf we take the judgment of authors of textbooks as a 
basis for determining the importance of the problems in arithmetic, 
we arrive at the conclusion that there are not more than 372 
type problems which are judged important enough to be included 
in a text by three out of four authors.”

§5.—Soctat anp Business ARITHMETIC 
(Study 26) 
A study was made by Wilson* “to determine the arithmetic 
actually used by adults in their social and business relations.” 
The material was collected in the following manner: 
A sheet containing the following instructions was sent to 
each superintendent and teacher assisting in the study: 
“ Arithmetic Survey 
“The purpose of this study is to find out by a simple and 
direct method what mature people are figuring, and to get some 
idea of the amount of figuring which they actually do. The ma- 
terial should be collected by sixth, seventh, and eighth grade 
pupils and this should be done in such a way as to interest these 
pupils in gathering the data. The following details should be 
observed: 
“Every father and mother of a sixth, seventh, or eighth grade 
pupil in your schools should be represented in the final returns. 
The effort should be made to get these data without particularly 
bothering or worrying the parents. In the evening, after the 
dishes are washed and the members of the family are together, 
the pupil should simply ask the mother (and father) whether or 
not she had any use for arithmetic during the day; if so, what? 
Then note the problems. They may relate to buying some eggs 
of a neighbor, or to figuring the bill from the grocer. In each 
case, the pupil should simply note the arithmetic involved and 
the statement should appear in simple problem form. No solutions 
are required. Where there is more*than one child in the same 
family, the work should be divided. If the mother reports no 
use whatever and this continues for the two weeks, the report 
should be turned in just the same, giving the name of the person, 
the occupation and the dates covered.

“Tt will doubtless be more satisfactory if the pupil will note 
on rough paper and then copy the problems the next day at 
school under the teacher’s direction, using the regular sheets which 
give the necessary general data at the top. 
“Please note that it is particularly desirable to get all of the 
data from every father and every mother, and not to get any 
extra data ‘trumped up’ for the occasion. These directions 
should be followed and the pupils should be so thoroughly in- 
structed that they will get into the game and get things right. 
If they see the purpose of the study, they will quite surely be 
interested. They will want to solve problems that actually come 
up for solution by mature people and they will want, also, to omit 
problems which do not have any practical value. Both of these 
are purposes in which the school is very greatly interested.”

to in the above instructions, contained the following heading:

“Problems figured during two weeks following date.......... 
“(List problems briefly; do not solve.)”’ 
Many teachers had their pupils indicate the date of each 
day reported on. This had the additional value of checking 
more closely the work of the pupils. Many schools used uniform 
paper for making reports; while this is not essential, it added to 
the convenience in scoring. These added details are recommended 
in future applications of the study. 
Some 14,583 problems were obtained from 4068 persons who 
were parents of the sixth, seventh and eighth grade children in the 
country, in sma!l towns, and in large cities. Small schools in lowa 
and the large school systems of Topeka, Sioux City, and Duluth 
are represented. The adults were listed by occupations; this 
list was compared with Ayres’ list of wage-earning occupations 
and found to include all except six out of the total of 68 occupa-

tions. Comparison with the nine groups of occupations of the 
Thirteenth Census (1910) showed a smaller percentage in agri- 
culture and domestic and personal service, and a greater per- 
centage in trade and transportation. 
The material was scored as follows: 
“Directions for Scoring 
“Each problem should be studied and scored on the following 
points: 
“1. Cross out any problem that appears to be made up for 
the oceasion. Only real problems should be scored. 
“2... Buying or selling. 
“3. United States money involved and the number of places 
involved in the factors of the problem. 
‘4, Topic or article bought or sold (or involved). 
“5. Arithmetical processes, as addition, subtraction, ete. 
“(a) In addition, subtraction, multiplication, and divi- 
sion, the degree of difficulty is to be noted as one 
place, two places, three places, etc. In addition 
and subtraction this means the addends or the 
terms involved and not the answers. In multiplica- 
tion the multiplier is to be considered, in division 
the divisor. 
“(b) In fractions, every fraction appearing is to be 
scored. The list will be sufficiently short. 
“(e) Other processes are to be scored without noting 
the degree of difficulty.” 
The following is a sample of the scoring:

The following are difficulties encountered in scoring, which are 
illustrated in the sample papers above: 
1. The problems of Father and Mother were seldom reported 
separately. It was necessary, in order to avoid confusion and 
misrepresentation, to indicate the problems belonging to each, and 
this was done by marking with an ‘‘H”’ (meaning housekeeper) 
all problems belonging to the mother. The problems so marked 
were collected and tabulated under housekeepers, leaving the 
others to be tabulated under the occupations of the fathers. 
2. The difficulty of indicating the topic or articles involved in 
Christmas shopping first led to the use of the class, ‘‘Miscellane- 
ous,” for this purpose. This is illustrated in problem 2, paper 247— 
Marshalltown. Occasionally department store purchases are so 
listed. In spite of the instruction to list nothing under “ Miscella- 
neous” that could be classified elsewhere, the total scores under 
this caption reached 630. 
   
-P-A-G-E-233
  MATHEMATICS 227 
3. Problem 4 of paper 247—Marshalltown, shows dollars with- 
out any cents being involved. The scorings under “U.S. Money” 
are 4 place and 5 place, but under “Addition” only 3 place. Since 
it is unnecessary to express the cents, it is manifestly an addition 
problem of only 3 place—$150+ $75. The scoring for “U. S. 
Money” is therefore two places too high. This is a common error, 
as explained elsewhere. 
These typical papers, as scored and commented upon, should 
make clear any ambiguities in the directions for gathering the data, 
or scoring and evaluating the returns. 
The instructions required that only real problems be scored. 
In order to determine how fully the spirit of the work was under- 
stood, a careful study was made of the problems thrown out. One 
cannot help being impressed with the fact that the work was 
taken seriously and performed in the spirit of honest codperation. 
There is an occasional problem (estimated at about 1 in 1,000) 
which is apparently a “‘made-up”’ problem; at any rate no motive 
was apparent to the scorer and it was thrown out. The following 
is an illustration: ‘‘If a stream flows at the rate of 10 yards in 
1 minute, how long will it take it to go 5 miles?”’ One can con- 
ceive a situation where the above might be a real problem, but 
no such situation is apparent in the report. 
The most common cause for throwing out problems was that 
the facts given were not sufficient to permit a solution, or were 
too simple to require a solution. The following are illustrations: 
1. The cost of two flower boxes including the dirt and flowers. 
2. My mother had to add up the grocery bill to see how ae 
was required to pay it each week. 
3. Mamma wanted to get me a dress. She knew how much a 
yard would cost and she had to figure out how much 
41% yards would cost. 
4. If I pay ten dollars a month for board and room, five dollars 
for clothing and five for amusements, putting the rest in 
the bank, how much do I put in the bank? 
5. My mother wants to buy a peck of potatoes. They are 
28c. a peck. How much will she have to pay?

Additional problems marked out of papers left in.... 113 
The papers were thrown out chiefly because the occupations 
were not reported. The individual problems thrown out contained 
insufficient data and are well illustrated by the ‘thrown-out” 
problems given above. Throwing out papers and problems not 
usable was one of the important tasks of the scorer, and in the 
later scoring this and the separation of papers according to occu- 
pations were the first things done. 
The material is classified both by ‘social topics” and by 
technical arithmetical processes involved. The “social topics” 
are as follows: 
9804 problems involved buying, 1500 involved selling, and 
1441 involved money where there was neither buying nor selling. 
Money was involved in 83 per cent of all the problems. One 
thousand unselected problems, involving money but neither 
buying nor selling, were analyzed and found to be concerned with 
(1) labor and wages, 45 per cent; (2) interest, 11 per cent; (3) 
rent, 6 per cent; (4) insurance, 4 per cent. One hundred other 
items are included in the remaining 34 per cent. Problems in- 
volving no money are equally widely distributed. Time or hours 
of labor constitute 20 per cent of these problems; measurement 
of capacity, 12 per cent; and estimates of building material, 10 
per cent. Housekeepers turned in 7345 problems; farmers, 1077; 
mechanics, 330; and merchants, 550. Ninety-four kinds of material 
are represented. Those most frequently mentioned are gro- 
ceries, 3398; dry goods, 1195; miscellaneous (Christmas), 834; 
labor and wages, 743; milk, 736; meat, 663; eggs, 462; clothing, 
430; and butter, 394. 
The arithmetical processes were determined for each problem 
as shown above and were then classified. Forty-three processes 
are listed and contained 21,898 cases in the 14,583 problems.

  MATHEMATICS 229 
Multiplication is used 6974 times; addition, 4416 times; subtrac- 
tion, 2833 times; division, 2437 times; fractions, 1974 times; 
accounts, 1212 times; and percentage, 417 times. These are the 
most frequent. Decimals, other than found in money, occurred 
only seven times. Ten problems, “possibly but not probably,” 
in proportion are listed. Apothecaries’ weight was reported four 
times — by physicians. Three problems involve square root and 
one involves partial payments. Single instances of Troy weight 
and partnership occur. 
In the fundamental process of addition occurring 4416 times, 
79 were one-place numbers; 2143, two-place; 1655, three-place; 
467, four-place; 66, five-place; and 6, six-place numbers. Three- 
place or less constitute 90 per cent of the cases. The ad- 
dends computed for two cities were 1737 cases. Of these 542 
contained two addends; 508, three addends; 291, four addends; 
and 184, five addends. The greatest number reported was 28. 
Problems involving five addends or less constitute 90 per cent of 
the cases. The chances are, therefore, 9 in 10 that no problem in 
addition will occur more complicated than the addition of five 
quantities of three places. 
In subtraction, 97 per cent of the problems have four places 
or less in the minuend and obviously no more than that number 
in the subtrahend. 
In multiplication, 99 per cent of the 6974 cases have three 
places or less in the multiplier. Fifty-three per cent are one-place 
multipliers and 39 per cent two-place. 
In 2347 division operations four places or less in the divisor 
constitute all the cases but one. The per cents run from one to 
four as follows: 40, 48, 13, and 5, neglecting decimals. 
Ninety per cent of the 1974 fractions tabulated consist of 
4, 4, ™& and % One-half is most frequent with 1289 cases (65 
per cent), followed by % with 189 cases, 4 with 159 cases and % 
with 119. Fifty separate fractions are met. The complete list 
occurring more than twice is: %, 4 and %; %, and %; %, %, and %; 
1; Ms, 3%, %, and %; 4; Mo, %0, and %o. Occasional appearances of
-P-A-G-E-236

fractions with the following denominators are tabulated: 11, 12, 
15, 16, 17, 18, 24, 25, 32, and 100. 
Conclusions 
1. The omission of the following processes which appear in 
the study is suggested: Decimals, except United States money; 
apothecaries’ weight; partial payments; partnership; square root; 
proportion; and Troy weight. 
2. The following processes do not appear, from which fact 
“it would appear to be a safe and conservative procedure to re- 
commend (them) for omission from the elementary work in arith- 
metic:” 
(a) G. C. D. and L. C. M. beyond the power of inspection. 
(b) Long, confusing problems in common fractions. (c) Complex 
and compound fractions. (d) Reduction of denominate num- 
bers. (e) Tables of folding paper, surveyor’s tables, and tables 
of foreign money. (f) Compound numbers. (g) Longitude and 
time. (h) Cases 2 and 3 in percentage. (i) Compound interest. 
(j) Annual interest. (k) Exchange. (1) True discount. (m) 
Partnership with time. (n) Ratio beyond the ability of frac- 
tions to satisfy. (0) Most of mensuration. (p) Cube root. 
(q) The metric system. 
3. The processes left are the four fundamental operations, 
fractions, accounts, percentage and its applications, simple de- 
nominate numbers, cancellation, mensuration, decimals, counting, 
and square root. 
4. The study, as it stands, while having some sources of error, 
is believed to be the best single basis yet available for determining 
the content of arithmetic as it should appear in schoolroom prac- 
tice and courses of study. 
5. The situation revealed in these adult problems is a surpris- 
ingly simple one when compared with present school practice. 
6. It is doubtful if arithmetic is entitled to the large time- 
expenditure which is now allotted to it in the elementary grades. 
7. On the negative side, this study shows that adults do 
not figure through complete situations, such as budgeting the 
 
-P-A-G-E-237
  MATHEMATICS 231 
family income, determining by careful estimate in advance the 
desirability of buying a carload of steers and finishing them for 
market, or determining the relative advantages of renting or 
buying city property. Work of this kind would not involve more 
difficult arithmetical processes, but it would indicate a more 
intelligent application of arithmetic to complete business situa- 
tions. The entire absence of work of this character may indicate 
a need which the schools have not formerly met, and which can be 
adequately met only by definitely organizing large motivated 
business situations for public school work. 
8. The present study is more extensive than necessary; 
the problems for a single week would have shown the same distri- 
bution. . . . If two weeks are used in such a survey, the 
second week should come at a different season of the year. 
9. The study shows the arithmetic needed by the masses, 
the 95 per cent of the population. It does not attempt to analyze 
the specific requirements of different business and commercial 
pursuits. 
10. Certain possible sources of error suggested by the author 
are: Parents may have invented problems to be accommodating, 
some parents did not contribute, pupils have not reported accu- 
rately in all cases, the parents contributing may have been too 
highly selected, the addition and subtraction problems may have 
been scored too high because of carrying ciphers when no cents 
were involved, and the scores had a constant probable error. 
§6—Department Store ARITHMETIC 
(Study 27) 
Department-store salespeople have presumably been taught 
the fundamental operations, fractions, and decimals in the ele- 
mentary grades; but frequent errors are found in their computa- 
tions. To discover exactly what operations are of importance 
for salespeople, several thousand sales checks were examined as 
follows by Charters: 
In addition, 7337 charge checks (records of purchase trans-
-P-A-G-E-238
  232 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
actions in which the goods are charged to the customers’ ac- 
counts), selected at random, were examined. In 75 per cent of 
the cases no addition was necessary because the customer pur- 
chased only one item. In 16 per cent of the cases two items were 
purchased; in five per cent, three; in two per cent, four; in 
one per cent each, five, six, and seven items. There were a few 
cases of purchase of more items up to the maximum of eighteen. 
In only one check out of twenty-five is it necessary to add more 
than three items. Five places constituted the maximum ($456.00). 
The typical case then corresponds closely to that found by Wilson. 
In 90 per cent of the cases involving addition the problems are 
not more difficult than four places and four addends. 
With this material at hand, it was possible to construct a 
review curriculum. This was done by the preparation of “practice 
tests” in which drill upon all facts (as 9-++8) was given equally. 
Unfortunately, it was impossible to pay special attention to the 
relative difficulty of the combinations, and to give additional drill 
on those of greater difficulty. 
For subtraction, 4304 cash checks were examined. In 24 
per cent of the cases the exact amount of the purchase was given 
by the customer and no subtraction was necessary. In tabulating| 
the remainder of the cases, the minuends (amount given in pay-| 
ment) were classified. Eighty-three per cent of these were listed 
as follows: { 
         
   
          
     
   Amount received Frequency Per cent 
$1.00 725 22 
5.00 701 21

20.00 141 4 
25 110 3 
3.00 09 3 
A complete table of each actual transaction was arrange 
showing how many times, for instance, one dollar was presente: 
 
-P-A-G-E-239
  MATHEMATICS 233 
in payment of a bill of 19 cents. From this table it was possible 
to determine exactly what subtraction facts (as, 16—9), were 
involved in the operations. 
At once it became apparent that salespeople in making change 
use only 45 of the possible one hundred subtraction facts. For 
instance, they never subtract 9 from 18. The reason for this 
limitation lies in the fact that change is always given in fives or 
multiples of five. Thus, if the bill is nine cents, the customer 
gives in payment 9 cents, 10 cents, a quarter, a haf dollar, a 
dollar or some larger bill but never 18 cents. Obviously this 
limits the range of subtractions. It easily follows by analysis of 
all possible cases that the subtraction facts used are: 15 minus 
9, 8, 7, and 6; 10 minus 9, 8, 7, 6, to 1; 9 minus 9, 8, 7, to 0; 8 
minus 8; 7 minus 7, 6, and 5; 6 minus 6 and.5; 5 minus 5, 4, to 
0; 4 minus 4, 3, to 0; 3 minus 3; 2 minus 2, 1, and 0; 1 minus 1 
and 0; and 0 minus 0. 
But it was found upon further examination that salespeople 
do not subtract at all; they add. If the purchase amounts to 9 
cents and a dollar is tendered in payment, the salesperson calcu- 
lates as follows:. The amount necessary to make 10 is added. 
This, a penny, is taken in the fingers from the penny compartment 
of the cash register, then a nickel and a dime, bringing the total 
to a quarter. This is followed by the selection of a quarter and a 
half. His statements to himself as he manipulates the money are 
“nine, ten, fifteen, twenty-five, fifty, one dollar.” 
This being the case the amount of subtraction used by a sales- 
man is negligible. A curriculum in subtraction was, therefore, 
made by the selection of quantities which would require the 
use of all compartments of the cash register and appeared as prac- 
tice tests as follows: 
        
        Amount of Sale Amount of Change Amount 
Received     
      
         
  1.00 16 64 
In studying multiplication the 7337. charge checks used in 
 
-P-A-G-E-240
    
  234 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
studying addition were analyzed. On the checks appear items 
such as 6 collars at 25 cents, amounting to $1.50, a process com- 
monly known in store terminology as an extension. In the checks 
were found 2771 extensions as against 1853 additions. 
Classifying these first upon the basis of multipliers (number of 
like articles bought) it was {found that in 54 per cent of the cases 
the multiplier 2 was used; in 18 per cent, 3; in 9 per cent, 4; 
in 5 per cent, 5; and 6 per cent, 6. These constituted 92 per 
cent of the cases. Multipliers within the limits of the conven- 
tional multiplication tables (from 2 to 12) constituted 97 per cent 
of the cases. Twenty-five was a multiplier in 19 cases and the 
remainder were under 20 except for a few multipliers ending in 
ciphers. 
On the other hand the multiplicand (price per article) showed 
that 10 cents was the most common price of articles bought more 
than one at a time. A few of the more frequent ran as follows, 
constituting 67 per cent of the cases. 
Price Frequency Price Frequency

There are 8 cases of four places in the multiplicand, 288 cases 
of three places, 310 cases of single-place numbers, and the balance, 
2173 (78 per cent), consisted of two places. 
From these facts it will be seen that in 97 per cent of the 
cases, at least, the multiplier is 12 or less, and the multiplicand 
three places or less. 
A review course of study was constructed within these limits 
in the form of practice tests. In one of these, the hundred most 
common extensions were included. In others, systematic exer-
-P-A-G-E-241
MATHEMATICS 235 
- cises with multipliers up to 12 were used. The value of the study 
lay in setting the limits of complexity. 
No division is used by salespeople except in the form of frac- 
tions. Everything is done to relieve them of calculations. In 
mark-down sales the reduced price is usually given. In adding 
per cents for the luxury war tax, the amount is placed on the 
sales tag. With some goods sold by the yard measuregraphs are 
used on which pointers on dials may be set, a crank turned, and 
the exact length and price are both indicated. But notwithstand- 
ing this it was found that in the 7337 checks referred to twice 
before, there were 444 cases of common fractions. In addition 
2458 sales checks were used to, supplement the study. From both 
sources 1178 cases were obtained. The distribution is shown as 
follows: 
  Denominators Pure Mixed Total Per cent. 
2 247 413 660 56 
4 137 160 297 25

10 il 0 1 0 
Total 454 727 1178 100 
It will be observed that one-half constitutes 56 per cent of 
the cases, either as a pure fraction (14), or as a mixed number, 
(414). Eighty-one per cent are halves or quarters. Sixteenths 
are more frequent than eighths. Obviously the range of denomina- 
tors is very narrow. 
Practice tests were constructed in which the fractions were 
drilled upon with equal attention to each denominator and with    
-P-A-G-E-242
  236 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION | 
varying numerators. Mixed multipliers were not used because 
these are not more complicated than pure fractions except that 
addition and multiplication are necessary. 
Decimal fractions were found to a very limited extent for 
reasons given above, and they consist of ten, fifteen, and twenty 
per cents in the stores studied. One “rule of thumb” method of 
computation is as follows: To get ten per cent of $11.73, for in- 
stance, ‘‘put your thumb over the three” and the part appearing, 
1.17, is ten per cent. To get twenty per cent multiply this by 
two, and to get fifteen per cent divide it by two, and add the 
quotient to ten pez cent. From this it is clear that decimals involve 
only “putting the thumb over the right-hand figure,’”’ addition, 
multiplication, and fractions. 
The conclusion is obvious. In this one vocation of department- 
store selling the chances are nine out of ten that no problem in 
addition will be more complicated than the addition of four four- 
place addends; no subtraction is used in making change, and if 
it were, only forty-five out of one hundred subtraction facts would 
be used; the chances are ninety-seven out of one hundred that in 
multiplication the multiplier will be 12 or less and the multipli- 
cand three places or less; in fractions only eleven denominators 
are found, all being under ten except ten, twelve, and sixteen; 
and by the simple device of using the thumb, decimals disappear. 
§7—ARITHMETIC AND OTHER CoMMERCIAL UsEs 
(Study 28) 
Mitchell* studied a standard cookbook, the payrolls of a 
number of artificial flower and feather factories, mark-down-sales 
advertisements, and a general hardware catalog. 
He states his purpose as follows: “The following study is 
presented to illustrate the use the author is making of the statistical 
method in discovering and in determining the relative importance 
of the various content elements of the course of study in arith- 
metic. . . . An index of the relative importance, from the

standpoint of social usage, of the different content elements is 
found in the frequency of their occurrence and in the manner of 
their use, 7. e., whether used in computations or merely in de- 
scriptive terms.” The four sources were analyzed and the arith- 
metical elements in each tabulated. 
Summarizing the tabular display of the cookbook arithmetic 
we find the following units of measurement: teaspoonful, table- 
spoonful, cup, pint, quart, gallon, peck, ounce, pound, and unit. 
The quantities used were %, %, %, %, 4, %, %, %, 1, and 32 
other whole and mixed numbers with the same denominators as 
in the pure fractions, in their fractional portions. The integer 
one affixed to the denominate numbers occurred most frequently, 
1836 times. One-half was next in importance, 1127 times, and 
2 followed with a total of 1101. Then appeared 3 with a score of 
484, % with 353 mentions, and 1% with 300. 
In the factory payrolls the dozen is the sole unit of measure- 
ment. The fractions are twelfths, sixths, fourths, thirds, and 
halves. The figures were obtained from the weekly payrolls of 100 
piece workers selected at random from 300 records examined in 
ten factories. Sixty-nine different fractions, integers, and mixed 
numbers were tabulated. The number of greatest frequency 
was %, which occurred 528 times out of a total of 2364 cases. 
Following this occurs 1 with a score of 476, M2 with 442, with 
292, % with 130, and 2 with 101. No mixed number occurred 
oftener than 25 times. 
“To compute accurately the earnings of any given worker, 
it is necessary to add to get the total number of dozens of articles 
made at each of the different rates per dozen, and then to multiply 
together each given rate per dozen and the total number of dozens 
of articles made at that rate. The arithmetical processes involved 
are, therefore, addition of all possible fractions with 12 as de- 
nominator to integers and mixed numbers. The fractional parts 
of the mixed numbers likewise include all possible fractions with 
) 12 as denominator; multiplication by a fractional integral, or 
mixed number of dozens, of decimals in terms of dollars and 
cents; and addition of United States money.”

238 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
In the 300 sales advertisements studied to find the nature of 
the arithmetical operations which the customer must know to 
understand the advertisements, both decimals and common frac- 
tions were found and tabulated together with the departments 
in which the discount applied. The 175 discounts, in per cents, 
were 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 33%, 40, 50, 60, and 75. Of these the 
most common were 20 per cent (31 times), 10 per cent (26 times), 
25 per cent (21 times), 10-50 per cent (16 times), and 50 per cent 
(13 times). The others probably ran less than ten in each case. 
The 125 fractional discounts were %, %, and %. Among these % 
occurred 57 times. 
The general hardware catalog reveals the following units of 
measurement: inch, foot, yard, ounce, pound, quart, dozen, 
gross, hundred, square foot, hundred-foot, and hundred square 
feet. Fractional parts have denominators as follows: 2, 3, 4, 6, 
8, 16, 32, and 64. Mixed numbers, with never more than two in- 
tegral places, are more common than pure fractions but less com- 
mon than integers. The dozen and gross were units of measure- 
ment in 1974 cases out of a total of 4075. 
His conclusions are as follows: 
1. The relative frequency of small numbers is great. 
2. The prominence of the dozen as a unit of production and 
of trade suggests the importance of familiarity with the aliquot 
parts of 12. 
3. Decimalization is much more important in school arith- 
metic than in production and trade. 
4. Discount rates in advertisements of mark-down sales 
are most often worked in per cents.

chemistry department that their students needed more than two 
years of high-school mathematics. In studying the text he exam- 
ined both the expository body and the problems of the text. In 
the expository portions of the text he determined what words and 
expressions were present which either were distinctly mathe- 
matical or implied mathematics. These were classified and the 
frequency obtained. The exercises were worked out by the 
simplest methods and both the operations and the quantities were 
tabulated. 
In determining what to select as mathematics, the following 
rules were laid down: 
1. Expressions giving dates, either specific or general, imply 
mathematics. Examples: 1844, last century. 
2. Denominate numbers are distinctly mathematical. Ex- 
amples: 50° F., 76 cm. 
3. Expressions having several meanings or uses are distinctly 
mathematical if, from the context, a mathematical meaning is 
evident; if not, they are omitted. Examples: equivalent, constant. 
4, Expressions having no use or meaning other than in a 
mathematical sense are distinctly mathematical. Example: 
volume and number. 
5. Expressions not classified under Rule 4, but involving a use 
of mathematics, are considered as implying mathematics. Ex- 
amples: rate of expansion, equilibrium, divisions of a scale. 
6. Cardinal, ordinal, and numeral adjectives are distinctly 
mathematical. Examples: three, first. 
7. Equations, formule, symbols, etc., are distinctly mathe- 
matical. Examples: F-32 C R 
ie 10k a0 
In the body of the text, 124 mathematical concepts were 
used 1156 times of which per cent (310 cases) and volume (208) 
constituted nearly half. Denominate numbers to the extent of 73 
were used 1937 times and of these, degree, °, was used 865 times. 
First, second, once, twice, double, and triple were used 301 times, 
first being used 116 times, second, 55 times, and twice, 20 times.

Fifty-five different fractions were used 242 times, and of these one- 
half occurred 47 times, one-fifth 32 times, one-tenth and one-third, 
23 times each, and one-fourth 17 times. The denominators of the 
fractions were ten or less in all cases except 43 cases and among 
these eight were less than one hundred and twenty-four ended in 
hundreds or thousands. Only five denominators were mixed 
decimals. 
In the body of the text 434 decimal fractions were used, of 
which 33 were one-place; 140 two-place; 125 three-place; 
and the remainder ran to eight places as the maximum. Mixed 
decimals occurred 1020 times. The most common form was 
found in 256 cases of two integers and one place, as 27.3. Other 
common forms were, two integers and two places, 186 times; 
one integer and two places, 173 times; three integers and one place, 
154 times; and one integer and one place, 121 times. Integral 
quantities occurred 4120 times. One-place integers, such as 9, 
occurred 1545 times; two-place, 1189 times; three-place, 902 
times; and four-place, 391 times. One twenty-place integer 
occurred. 
In the problems, which were solved and the quantities and 
operations tabulated, 19 denominate-number units occurred 173 
times, the most frequent being gross, 32 times; liter, 32 times; 
and degree, 17 times. Twenty-one operations are listed as occur- 
ring 962 times. In these, chemical equations occurred 134 times 
and multiplication with integers, 149 times, and with decimals, 
118 times. Equations of first degree and one unknown occurred 
7 times, and with two unknowns, twice. There were no equations 
of two unknowns. Fractional equations occurred six times, and 
algebraic addition, twice. Algebraic subtraction, multiplication, 
and division did not occur. There were nine cases of substitution 
in formule and 77 cases of ratio and proportion. No other 
algebra occurred. 
In the problems, arithmetical addition is shown in its most 
complicated form, as for instance the addition of three numbers 
consisting of one integer and three decimals, such as 8.456, two 
integers and three decimals, and three decimals. The range of
-P-A-G-E-247
MATHEMATICS 241 
subtraction is very narrow, the most complicated being the sub- 
traction of one six-place decimal from another. In the 235 cases 
of multiplication, 93 consisted of the multiplication of a two-place 
integer by a one-place integer. In 156 cases the operation involved 
nothing more complicated than a four-place integer by a six- 
place. In decimals 63 cases were found in which a decimal frac- 
tion or a mixed decimal is multiplied by an integer. Of these the 
decimal is never more extended than four places and the mixed 
decimal than five places in the integral portion and three places 
in the decimal portion. In 16 cases mixed decimals are multiplied 
by mixed decimals, the most complicated being 34.875 by 326.74. 
In 139 cases of division, 46 consist of the division of one integer 
by another, mostly two- and three-place integers. In 25 cases a 
decimal was divided by an integer. In 26 cases an integer was 
divided by a decimal. In 42 cases a mixed decimal was divided 
into another mixed decimal, the most complicated being 874362.73 
divided by 847.2. 
The study shows quite clearly that the mathematical informa- 
tion needed in freshman chemistry is limited to arithmetic and to 
simple algebraic processes with a wide range of denominate 
number units. The arithmetic is quite complicated and the 
algebra quite simple. 
Mrs. T. T. Callaway (30) made a companion study* to that of 
Williams for the freshman clothing course. Using the same rules 
of procedure, she examined a freshman text, ‘Clothing for 
Women,” by Laura I. Baldt, which is used in Stephens College. 
The report is summarized as follows: 
The mathematical concepts, a reading knowledge of which is 
necessary for understanding the text, are 111 in number. Of 
these, 44 are geometrical terms chiefly included in simple men- 
suration, and all the others are arithmetical. The pupil may be- 
come familiar with all the facts by the time she has completed the 
_ eighth grade, except a few facts in geometry which are involved 
in pattern-drafting and which can be Jearned easily on the job.

The most commonly mentioned concepts are line (613 times), 
equal (447), center (311), measure (285), width (171), length (132), 
point (107). The tota] number of mentions of concepts was 3115. 
The denominate numbers used are those which occur in ordi- 
nary grade arithmetic, with two exceptions, the head and the 
skein. Long measure and United States money are the two most 
important measures used in making clothing. The inch occurs 
1122 times out of a total of 1723 uses of denominate numbers, 
while the word foot does not occur at all. The dollar sign occurs 
454 times. 
The order runs as follows: inch, 1122, the dollar sign, 454 
times; the yard, 70 times; head, 14; year, 12; and the remainder 
below 12. 
The common fractions occur as follows: one-half, 214 times, 
quarter 248 times, sizth 15 times, eighth 108 times, tenth 16 
times, twelfth 5 times, and sixteenth 9 times. Only 59 cases in- 
cluded in the above list were given in figures. There were twelve 
cases of a decimal fraction (.5). There were 176 cases of frac- 
tions other than that of United States money, but distributed in 
about the same proportion among the various denominators. 
Integers occur as follows: Of 532 words, 523 were one-place 
integers. In addition to this, there were eight two-place and one 
larger. In Arabic figures there were 1048 occurrences, of which 2 
were zero, 566 were one-place, 161 two-place, 289 three-place, and 
30 four-place quantities. There were 77 Roman numerals, of 
which 71 were one-place and 6 two-place. 
“Tt did not seem necessary to make a table showing the opera- 
tions and processes required in this text, for the reason that prac- 
tically all the problems in which they are used are contained in the 
five chapters on the drafting and use of patterns. These are 
usually stated in the form of rhetorical algebraic equations, con- 
_veniently listed and accompanied by a small drawing of the pat- 
tern to be drafted. These equations represent arithmetical prob- 
lems to be solved, geometrical constructions to be made, or, more 
frequently, a combination of the two. Relatively few processes 
are required in the solution of the problems, but every possible

have been listed with reference to the relative emphasis which 
the different texts lay upon them in so far as this emphasis can be 
determined by proportions of space and frequencies of reference. 
“Method. At the outset the following method was adopted: 
the number of words in each of the books was carefully computed 
by one person; each book was then assigned to an individual for 
analysis, with the expectation that the topics and the amount 
of space devoted to each could be determined for each book and 
the results be brought together later for comparison. A brief trial 
proved this method to be unsatisfactory, and the procedure was 
so modified that each member of the group was assigned a single 
period or epoch and asked to analyze each of the books with refer- 
ence to this period, noting the topics and names common to all 
of the books, the topics and names common to at least three- 
fourths of the books, and the topics and names common to at 
least one-half of the books. The brief statement of preliminary 
results published in the Fourteenth Yearbook is based upon this 
analysis. 
“At the conclusion of this work the results seemed to justify 
a careful ‘checking’ in order to reduce the error as unavoidable 
when so many individuals collaborate in work-of this sort.” 
An examination was made to show changes in the tendencies 
of the organization of the tests, appendices, references, and bibli- 
ographies; questions, outlines, and problems; style; anecdotal 
materials; pictures and maps. 
The periods of American history were listed as the following: 
Discovery and exploration; Colonial development; Colonial wars; 
pre-Revolution; Revolution; 1783 to 1812; 1812 to 1861; Civil 
War; and 1865 to date of publication. 
The percentage of space devoted to each period in each book 
was tabulated and from this tabulation tendencies were observed. 
Each of the periods was sub-classified and the average per cent of 
the total space of the period devoted to each was tabulated. For 
instance, the amount of space devoted to Spanish exploration in 
the period of discovery and exploration rose from 9 per cent in 
the books published between 1865 and 1874 to 37 per cent in  
-P-A-G-E-250
    
  248 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
the next later group of texts, and in the latest period it is 29 per 
cent. 
Similar analyses and tabulations were made for each period. 
Relative emphasis was determined upon a word basis; as, for 
instance, in Goodrich’s text it was found that 23.8 per cent of the 
words were devoted to a consideration of the Civil War. In some 
periods the presence of topics in all the books, in three-fourths, 
and in one-half was calculated. 
For each period the persons whose names are mentioned in 
connection therewith in each book were enumerated. The names 
appearing in all the books, in three-fourths, and in one-half were 
determined. In some periods the division between civil and mili- 
tary leaders was observed. The proportion of space devoted 
by the latest group of books to the exploits and achievements of 
the persons in the period of discovery and exploration was calcu- 
lated and, rating the one with the greatest amount of space 
devoted to him at 100, the others were evaluated and ranked. 
The distribution runs as follows: Columbus, 100; Raleigh, 26; 
Champlain, 20; ete. 
A “Hall of Fame” was constructed by noting the “relative 
frequency of reference” of the names of each period. Two classes 
of leaders were made, civil and military, although some appear in 
both. The person obtaining the most frequent mention in each 
was rated at 100 and the others in their respective proportions. 
In the period from 1765 to 1865 among civil leaders Lincoln is 
rated at 100, Washington at 84, Jefferson at 82, Jackson at 49. 
Among military leaders the ratings run: Washington, 100; R. E. 
Lee, 83; Grant, 76; Sherman, 48; Cornwallis, 42; and so forth. 
As a check upon the relative emphasis accorded these leaders 
in school texts, the relative proportion of space devoted to the 
same names among civil leaders in the “Encyclopedia Britannica” 
(11th Edition) was computed. The Pearson co-efficient was found 
to be .27, the most notable shift being Franklin, who was accorded 
eleventh rank in the school texts and second in the Encyclopedia. 
A list of the topics common to all of the twenty-three books and 
a further list common to three-fourths of the books are sum-

   marized.* A few additional found in less than three-fourths are 
included, particularly where they coincide with the recommenda- 
tions of the Committee of Eight of the American Historical Asso- 
ciation. This list indicated by plus and minus signs whether the 
amount of space devoted to each topic has noticeably increased or 
decreased chronologically in the groups of texts. Asterisks indicate 
the topics recommended by the Committee of Eight. 
The more important facts set forth in the preceding pages 
may be summarized as follows: 
“(1) In so far as can be determined from the materials pre- 
sented in the textbooks, elementary American history as taught 
in the seventh and eighth grades has been and still is predom- 
inantly political and military history. 
“(2) Within the past fifty years, the emphasis upon military 
affairs as measured by the proportion of space devoted to wars 
has declined. In general, battles and campaigns are treated less 
in detail than was formerly the rule, while proportionately more 
space is devoted to the causes and the results of the wars. The 
lessening emphasis upon the details of the wars is first noticed in 
some of the textbooks published between 1881 and 1888, and the 
tendency has been general and decided since that time. 
(8) The later books give a perceptibly heavier emphasis to 
the facts of economic and industrial development than do the 
earlier books, although political development still constitutes the 
essential core of elementary historical instruction. 
“(4) As regards the treatment of specific eras or epochs, the 
principal increases in emphasis are to be noted in connection with: 
(a) the period 1783-1812 (especially in the treatment of the so- 
called ‘critical period’ between the close of the Revolution and 
the adoption of the Constitution); (b) the non-military affairs 
of the period 1812-1861; and (c) European events preceding and 
during the periods of discovery, exploration, and settlement. 
““(6) The persons whose names are most frequently men- 
tioned in the elementary textbooks are very predominantly those 
*Part I, Sixteenth Yearbook, pp. 143 to 155. 
 
-P-A-G-E-252
250 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
who have been most intimately associated with political develop- 
ment and with military and naval affairs. 
““(6) Variations among the several textbooks in respect of 
persons mentioned are numerous and wide. Most of the books 
mention a very much larger number of names than the average 
pupil will be likely to remember. Certain names, however, are 
made to stand out through repetition. Whether these are the 
names that should in justice be perpetuated through the powerful 
agency represented by universal education is a question which it 
is not the province of this paper to consider. 
“(7) Variations in the topics and events which constitute the 
chief content of elementary historical instruction are probably 
less numerous and less wide than variations in names of persons 
mentioned. In any case there is a rather distinct ‘core’ of topics 
common to most of the books, and these topics may be looked 
upon as constituting the present ‘standardized’ content of ele- 
mentary American history. Again it is not the province of this 
paper to consider the right of these common topics to the important 
place that they now occupy as basic elements in the culture of the 
next generation. 
(8) Numerous changes have taken place in the construction 
of elementary textbooks in history during the past fifty years. 
The more important of these are: (a) a movement toward a sim- 
pler ‘style’ with larger emphasis upon clear statements of causal 
relationships; (b) the introduction and development of the ‘prob- 
lem’ as a method of teaching history, and a consequent encourage- 
ment of ‘judgment’ as contrasted with rote memory — of rational 
as contrasted with verbatim mastery; (c) a marked decline in the 
employment of imaginative pictures as illustrations and an in- 
crease in the use of pictures that represent sincere attempts to 
portray actual conditions; (d) a marked decline in the use of 
anecdotal materials; (e) a larger and wider use of maps.”

HISTORY 251 
§4-Smrvice History ror THE Soctan ScrENCcES 
(Studies 33 and 34) 
Horn* assumed that the chief purpose of teaching history in 
the elementary school is “to make pupils more intelligent with 
respect to the more crucial activities, conditions, and problems of 
present-day life.” The crucial problems -were obtained from the 
heads of the university departments of political science and sociol- 
ogy and economics. The books in which each problem was given 
the most intelligent treatment were obtained from the same expert 
source. The following historical data were obtained from each 
book examined: (1) The percentage of historical material in each 
book. (2) The specific and approximate dates referred to in each 
book. (8) The historical characters referred to in each book. 
(4) The frequency of reference to each period in history (following 
Bagley and Rugg). (5) The frequency of reference to each of the 
most important phases of history (following Langlois and Seig- 
nobos). (6) Movements, events, conditions, problems, etc., used 
as check on the material collected under 5. 
The investigator points out certain difficulties encountered, 
such as variations among scorers, unavoidable indefiniteness in the 
directions dealing with the phases of history, and the question as 
to whether the best books had been selected. 
To check the study the historical material in thirty-eight 
topics of the International Encyclopedia was analyzed. Three- 
fourths of the dates compiled from both sources were census dates, 
and outside of these only one date, 1803, is included in the Wooters 
list obtained from members of the American Historical Associa- 
tion. Period reference was distributed under ancient, medieval, 
and modern, American, and modern history not American, by coun- 
tries (showing the frequent mention of many small countries, such 
as New Zealand), and by periods in ancient history. 
Persons were listed for each problem with which they were 
mentioned. Mention was tabulated first as the product of the 
number of mentions per problem and the number of separate 
*Sixteenth Yearbook, Part I, pp. 156-172, Ernest Horn. 
 
-P-A-G-E-254
252 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
problems in which they were mentioned in the book; second, the 
same procedure was followed for the articles; third, a combination 
of these; and fourth, a ranking of the separate mentions in prob- 
lems in encyclopedias and books. Sixteen hundred individuals 
were mentioned, most of them once. Two hundred and sixty- 
one occurred in both books and articles or in one or the other with 
a score of 6 (by products). Roosevelt receives most frequent 
mention among living or dead characters. Adam Smith and John 
Stuart Mill stand higher than Napoleon, Washington, or Jefferson. 
References to phases in history were compared with the Com- 
mittee of Eight report and the Bagley and Rugg study of modern 
textbooks. Naturally, the books and articles analyzed devote 
much more attention to social and economic phases of history 
than to military and political. The figures run in the books 
analyzed as follows: political, 18.7 per cent; military, 4.7 per 
cent; and social and economic, 76.3 per cent. In the Bagley and 
Rugg study they run 42, 40, and 18 respectively. 
Bassett* (34) made a similar study, following Horn, and limited 
his investigations to the history “most necessary to the intelligent 
understanding of modern political problems, conditions, and activi- 
ties.” (Political is substituted for social, found in Horn’s study.) 
The method of procedure was essentially the same with a few 
exceptions. Members of the staff in the department of political 
science in the University of Iowa were asked to make a list and 
indicate the books in which they were best treated. The Cyclo- 
pedia of American Government was substituted for the Inter- 
national Encyclopedia, and Small’s outlines, found in his General 
Sociology, were used as a basis for classification instead of Langlois 
and Seignobos. 
In checking and classifying these historical data, the following 
rules and regulations are observed: 
“(1) Score only those references that are clearly historical. 
“(2) In case of historical movements, events, and problems, 
indicate them in the specific terms of the author, and place the

  HISTORY 253 
reference under the main section of the outline where it seems most 
logically to belong. In case the reference clearly has a double 
significance it may be checked under two headings, as, for example, 
under ‘Protection of Health’ and under ‘Achievements in Har- 
monizing Human Relations.’ 
““(8) Score any given item but once in a single paragraph. 
““(4) Dates in parentheses are not to be checked. 
“The analysis of a single paragraph may serve further to 
illustrate the classes of data desired, and the method used in 
checking the material. The following paragraphs taken from a 
contemporary writer upon ‘Equal Suffrage’ will serve as the basis 
of this analysis: 
“«The movement for equal suffrage may be said to have begun 
in England toward the close of the eighteenth century. In 1792 
Mary Wollstonecraft published a book on the Vindication of the 
Rights of Women which, though greeted with a storm of ridicule 
and abuse, gave the first considerable impulse to a discussion on 
the subject. In 1797 Charles Fox is quoted as saying that all the 
superior classes of the female sex in England must be more capable 
of exercising the elective suffrage with deliberation and propriety 
than the uninformed individuals of the lowest class of men to 
whom the advocates of universal suffrage would extend it. Ben- 
tham likewise remarked upon the injustice of refusing women 
the right to vote. In 1835 Bailey strongly advocated the exten- 
sion of the suffrage to women in his treatise entitled ‘The Rationale 
of Political Representation.’ Likewise, Benjamin Disraeli, in 
1848, declared in the House of Commons that he saw no reason for 
denying women the right to vote. But the most influential advo- 
cate of equal suffrage in England was John Stuart Mill, who 
espoused the cause with great power in his book on ‘The Subju- 
gation of Women,’ published in 1869. Moreover, in 1867 Mill 
championed the cause of equal suffrage in the House of Commons 
by proposing it as an amendment to the Reform Bill then pending.’ 
“The specific items of historic interest in this paragraph are 
(1) Equal Suffrage, a subject to be classified under ‘Achievements 
in Harmonizing Human Relations,’ (2) the Reform Bill, likewise  
-P-A-G-E-256
  254 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
under ‘Achievements in Harmonizing Human Relations’ and (3) 
England, to be placed under ‘Leading Foreign Countries.’ Equal 
suffrage is mentioned three times, but since it is within a single 
paragraph, the subject is checked only once. England is mentioned 
twice, but is checked once. 
“The specific dates occurring in this paragraph are 1792, 1797, 
1835, 1848, 1867, 1869. The general period of the eighteenth cen- 
tury is also mentioned. 
“The historical characters mentioned are Bailey, Bentham, 
Benjamin Disraeli, Charles Fox, John Stuart Mill, and Mary 
Wollstonecraft. Each of these persons is checked once, notwith- 
standing the fact that Mill’s name appears twice. 
In Bassett’s study of twenty-two books, 653 names were found, 
23 of which occurred in connection with three or more subjects. 
These were rated by products; that is, Roosevelt, being mentioned 
25 times in connection with ten different problems, was given a 
rating of 25 times 10, or 250. Roosevelt occupies first rank with 
the score just mentioned; then come Cleveland, 63; Adam Smith, 
55; McKinley, 45; Taft and Jackson, 44 each; and so forth. In 
the Encyclopedia of American Government seventy-nine names 
were found. Only five were mentioned in connection with more 
than one subject: Cleveland, Taft, Roosevelt, Wilson, and Francis 
Wright, rated in the order named. 
In the books 214 dates, and in the Encyclopedia 89, were 
found. These show a marked divergence from Wooters’ list. The 
dates 1492 and 1607 appeared only once; 1812, six times, and 1765 
and April 14, 1861, not at all. More than 90 per cent were sub- 
sequent to 1812 as compared with 46 per cent in textbooks. 
Comparisons were made with Bagley and Rugg for frequency 
of reference by periods with the observable difference that the 
history textbook devoted 25 per cent of its space to the period 
1861-1916, while the figures in this study were 74 per cent.

HISTORY 255 
§5—History in Porrry 
(Study 35) 
Mrs. Dodd* studied the technique of determining the specific 
historical references contained in the 118 English poems required 
for entrance to the University of Illinois. To her the term “specific 
reference” means dates, institutions, persons, places, and written 
productions. 
The plan to consider the historical references in each word and 
phrase was the first to present itself, but obviously such a plan 
would resolve itself into a study of the etymology of each word 
and the connotations which have grown up around it. It is diffi- 
cult to determine what historical flavors and fragments of informa- 
tion are connoted in the phrase ‘“‘ivy-mantled tower” when Gray 
speaks of “In yonder ivy-mantled tower, the moping owl does to 
the moon complain.” Equally difficult is it to determine what 
history one should know to obtain the full flavor. Important as 
such a study would be, it was discarded because of practical 
difficulties, and the plan of collecting only specific references was 
decided upon. 
The classification of the items was developmental, growing as 
the study progressed, rather than systematic, following an ac- 
cepted expert classification. The classes were the following: char- 
acter, event, place, social class, symbol, institution, date, docu- 
ment, people, principle, and established fact. 
The second difficulty faced, when specific references are listed, 
was the determination of the historical background included in the 
thoughts, feelings, resolutions, beliefs, and customs of the indi- 
vidual characters and of the peoples treated in the selections. The 
lyrics and the drama are rich in feeling, but none of this adheres 
to the specific references. Furthermore, the historical references 
frequently lose their significance when taken out of their setting 
in the poem. In addition, literary references are likely to distort 
historical facts. These difficulties were not solved. 
*Journal of Educational Research, Vol. IV, No. 4, Mrs. S. H. Dodd.
-P-A-G-E-258
256 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
A third problem was that of scoring. A quotation of fifteen 
lines from “‘Alexander’s Feast” will facilitate the discussion: 
“oTwas at the royal feast for Persia won 
By Philip’s warlike son; 
Aloft in awful state 
The godlike hero sate 
On his imperial throne; 
His valiant peers were placed around, 
Their brows with myrtle and with roses crown’d, 
(So should desert in arms be crowned); 
The lovely Thais by his side 
Sate like a blooming eastern bride 
In flower of youth and beauty’s pride:— 
Happy, happy, happy pair! 
None but the brave, 
None but the brave, 
None but the brave deserve the fair.” 
It would be impossible to score all references to Alexander, for 
instance. There are eight such references, including the title, as 
follows: Alexander; Philip’s warlike son; hero; his (three times); 
pair (distributed as reference to Alexander and Thais); and, pos- 
sibly, brave. 
It is quite evident, however, that in a total summary of refer- 
ences to Alexander there would be a quite different significance 
attached to the importance of knowledge of Alexander if the eight 
references were gathered from eight different poems or from fifteen 
lines of one poem. In the former case he would be a character 
referred to frequently in literature; in the latter, only once, though 
frequently on that occasion. This line of reasoning led to the 
decision to score characters, places, dates, institutions, and written 
productions only once for each selection. 
A fourth problem was connected with the scoring of dates. 
Take, for instance, the question of how to dispose of ‘‘Written in 
Early Spring” and ‘St. Cecilia’s Day, 1687”; the first was dis- 
carded on the ground that it was not a specific reference to a date, 
 
-P-A-G-E-259
Ee RET, eT ee pe eee Eee ee ye ee ee ee ar ee 
HISTORY 257 
and the second included because it was specific. So also was 
discarded for the same reason: December, Christmas, Martian 
Kalends, Marathon Day, and One hundred fourscore and thirteen 
years in the ‘Battle of Lake Regillus.” Dates appearing in the 
titles of poems were included, while dates showing the year of 
publication were omitted. 
Only twelve dates appeared in the 118 poems. These were 
Marathon Day, 490 B.C., in Browning’s “Pheidippides”; St. 
Cecilia’s Day, Nov. 22, 1687, in Browning’s “A Song for St. 
Cecilia’s Day”; Drummessie Day, April 16, 1746, in Burns’s 
“Lament for Culloden”; 1692 and May 31, 1692, in Browning’s 
“Hervé Riel”; 1746 in Collins’s “Ode Written in MDCCXLVI”; 
1802 in Wordsworth’s ‘England and Switzerland, 1802”; 1802 
in Wordsworth’s “London MDCCCII”’; Sept. 3, 1802, in Words- 
worth’s “Upon Westminster Bridge, Sept. 3, 1802’; 1803 in 
Wordsworth’s ‘Yarrow Unvisited, 1803’; 1803 in Wordsworth’s 
“Composed at Neidpath Castle, 1803;”’ and September, 1814, in 
Wordsworth’s “Yarrow Visited.” 
A fifth problem arose in connection with specific references to 
persons including references to individuals and peoples. The 
characters fell naturally into four groups: historical, Biblical, 
legendary, and mythical, with shadowy lines between the groups. 
Historical characters were considered to be those appearing in 
“The Century Cyclopedia of Names,’’ Brewer’s “The Reader’s 
Handbook”, or in the editorial textual exposition of authors’ 
writings found in special editions. To be tabulated as an historical 
character the person must have actually lived and must have a 
definite record in addition to that made in the poem. References 
to “brother” in ‘“‘Snowbound”’ and to “doctor” and “sergeant” 
in “Macbeth” were not included on the ground that only specific 
names should be listed. Similar action was taken in the case of 
common nouns, such as “peers”’ in ‘‘ Alexander’s Feast.’’ Where 
different names for the same person were used, they were included 
if they carry different connotations, as, Macbeth, Thane of Caw- 
dor, and King of Scotland. Names of authors of poems were not
-P-A-G-E-260
    
| 258 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
included unless they appeared within the poems analyzed. Per- 
sonal references by pronouns were not included. 
One hundred and twenty-seven different characters appear in 
the 118 poems and none appear in more than one poem. Biblical 
characters are designated on the basis of their mention in the 
Bible. Of these there were twenty. Six Biblical peoples are 
listed: Christians, Hebrew-Jews, Ephesians, Midianites, Phil-| 
istines, and Romans. Historical peoples are defined as those not 
now in existence and include references to clans (Clan Alpine), 
line of descent (House of Beaudesert), family groups (Douglas), 
religious groups (Druids), groups by nickname (Yankee), city- 
states (Athenian), and races (Angles). Proper adjectives were 
scored under the name of proper noun (Lydia for Lydian). Ref- 
erences to persons in ‘The Lays of Ancient Rome’’ were, upon 
expert advice, not included among historical characters. Legen- 
dary characters—human beings of whose actual existence there is 
no authentic record (Robin Hood),— and mythological char- 
acters — superhuman beings conceived of as possessing divine 
characteristics (Apollo) — were not included. 
Nine references to written productions were found: Bariffe’s| 
“Artillery Guide” and Goldinge’s ‘‘Commentaries of Casar”’ in| 
“The Courtship of Miles Standish’’; Chalkley’s “Journal” in| 
“Snowbound”’; Chapman’s “‘Homer”’ in ‘On First Looking int 
Chapman’s ‘Homer’ ”’; Sewell’s ‘History of the Quakers” an 
“Arabian Nights” in “Snowbound”’; and the Bible, the On 
Hundredth Psalm, and Proverbs, in “The Courtship of Mile 
Standish.” 
Mrs. Dodd’s summary of technique is as follows: 
“At best this investigation has secured only a partial amount’ 
of the historical content contained in the poems analyzed. I 
securing this content the following methods were used:    
    
      
     
   
    
   
       
   “1. To score only once each reference of a kind in a give 
poem.

GEOGRAPHY 
(Studies 36-39) 
§1—InrRropucTION 
Four quite distinct problems are attacked in the geography 
studies. One writer obtains a consensus of teachers’ opinions con- 
cerning the relative rankings of countries for purposes of emphasis 
in geography instruction. This study is the earliest reported upon 
in the literature examined and consequently does not use rigorous 
methods. The second study is concerned with the technique of 
determining the content of geography from an examination of 
newspapers and magazines, proceeding on the assumption that 
the content of school geography will be determined by its use in 
current literature. Here again, as in history, explicit mention of 
geography was investigated and no further attention was paid to| 
the problem of determining the geography ‘‘necessary to under-| 
stand” the material read. The third study, of a comprehensive 
sort, seeks to determine the importance of countries by setting up 
objective, quantitative standards, obtained by composite ranking, 
according to. area, population, exports, imports, etc. The fourth 
study uses geographical material as the basis for a technical study] 
which seeks to determine short methods to obviate the drudgery 
of exact tabulation.

their locations are permanently learned.

  GEOGRAPHY 261 
The method used is that of obtaining a consensus. The details 
are as follows: Seventy-five teachers, principals, and superintend- 
ents in the geography class at Cornell University, from twenty or 
more states and representing all kinds of schools, were used as 
judges. The teachers were divided into committees and each com- 
mittee was asked to decide upon what cities in the continent 
assigned to it are of primary importance — “cities that are so im- 
portant that the American school teacher should teach their loca- 
tion rather accurately, teach why they are important, and for 
what they stand in world affairs. It was agreed that a city must 
stand for more than one important thing in order to be included 
in the list.” 
The findings of these committees were passed over to a com- 
mittee of the faculty of geography consisting of three geographers, 
a professor of education, and two superintendents. By a method 
which is not clear it was found that two-thirds of the cities listed 
by the first committees failed of approval by the faculty committee. 
Any city in the United States which received two or more of the 
faculty votes was listed. 
The cities of the United States obtaining full votes were: New 
York, Chicago, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Boston, Pittsburgh, San 
Francisco, New Orleans, Washington, and Minneapolis-St. Paul. 
Those receiving four votes were: Puget Sound cities and Galves- 
ton. Next in rank were Cleveland, Buffalo, Salt Lake City, 
Scranton-Wilkes-Barre, and Lowell. Those receiving two votes 
were: Baltimore, Cincinnati, Milwaukee, Louisville, Kansas City, 
and Indianapolis. 
The outstanding cities of Europe were: London, Liverpool, 
Edinburgh, Glasgow, Berlin, Hamburg, Rome, Athens, Constan- 
tinople, St. Petersburg, and Paris. Cities of Asia receiving full 
votes were Bombay, Calcutta, Pekin, Jerusalem, Tokyo-Yoko- 
hama. On the Western continent, outside of the United States, 
cities included were Montreal, Quebec, Rio de Janeiro, Buenos 
Aires, Havana, and Mexico City. In the rest of the world were 
listed: Manila, Honolulu, Cairo, Cape Town, Melbourne, Johan- 
nesburg, Sydney, and Batavia.

§3—-NEWSPAPERS AND MAGAZINES 
(Study 37) 
W. C. Bagley* made a preliminary study of newspapers and 
magazines to “record geographical references and determine from 
the frequency of*these references the relative value of the different 
types of geographical information. 
“A large number of newspapers and magazines were read by 
members of the seminary, the geographical . . . references 
were recorded and classified, and an attempt was made to evaluate 
the general procedure as a means of determining minimum essen- 
tials. 
“The methods of counting references is an important detail in 
the technique of this work. Two methods were tried: (1) counting 
one for each term (such as the name of a place or of an historical 
event) or each statement with a geographical or historical con- 
tent; and (2) taking as the unit the article in which the reference 
occurs, and counting one for each article containing a certain type 
of reference. (Thus, if London as a commercial center is referred 
to in an article, this group of references receives one credit, no 
matter how many times the word London may recur in the course 
of the article. But if in the same article London is referred to in 
another way, a separate count under its appropriate group is 
made for this reference.) A comparison of these two methods 
showed clearly that the latter is to be preferred, and this was used 
in two out of the three investigations reported.” 
Eighteen issues of The Outlook and The Literary Digest. from 
1906-13 yielded 2237 geographical references. The distribution 
was as follows:

“A grouping of this sort is obviously subject to the errors or 
peculiarities of individual judgment, but it may be said that the 
classification just presented is quite consistent with those furnished 
by other readers. Except for the absence of explicit reference to 
physiographical principles, this grouping represents fairly accu- 
rately the distribution of emphasis in the textbooks ordinarily used 
in the seventh and eighth grades. The physiographical principles, 
however, are precisely the ‘general’ principles to which we referred 
above; that is, their function is broadly interpretative and adaptive; 
they ‘cover’ a host of particulars too numerous in the aggregate, 
and too insignificant separately to warrant specific attention. 
“Another suggestive grouping is based upon the frequency of 
references to the various continents. If one is to read intelligently 
the journals which formed the basis of this test, one will find 
occasion to apply one’s knowledge of the continents in approxi- 
mately the following proportions (the maximum frequency of ref- 
erence being represented arbitrarily by 100):

“The countries and colonies of Asia show the following propor-

divisions), 4 each. 
This order of frequency in references to European and Asiatic 
countries is fairly constant in ne two reports which furnish com- 
parable data. 
“The frequency of reference to cities is perhaps not so sig- 
nificant, although here, too, there is a goodly measure of similarity 
among the different reports. A combined rating, which may mean 
much or little, is given herewith:

“There is, in general, a direct, although not a perfect, correla- 
tion between the number of references to cities and the size of the 
cities — except, of course, that capitals of countries have an impor- 
tance not always represented by their size.
-P-A-G-E-267
GEOGRAPHY 265 
“Compared with references to countries and cities, the refer- 
ences to physical and physiographical features are not numerous. 
For readers of the journals used in the investigation, information 
about the following rivers seems to be of the greatest importance 
and approximately in the order named for the first five: Missis- 
sippi, Hudson, Ohio, Missouri, Rhine, Nile, Danube, St. Lawrence, 
Potomac, La Plata, Seine, Niagara, Rio Grande, Columbia, 
Amazon, Congo. References to seas and gulfs follow the following 
order: Mediterranean, Aigean, Mexico, Black, Adriatic, Marmora, 
Red, and Caspian. The straits most frequently mentioned are the 
Dardanelles, Bosphorus, Magellan, and Bering.” 
Bagley ‘ventures the following opinions”’ as a result of this 
trial with geography and parallel study with history: 
“1. A thoroughgoing application of the method might well 
result in a table showing the relative frequency with which certain 
geographical and historical references recur in the discussions of 
current problems, and this table might prove suggestive to teachers 
and administrators, and especially to textbook writers, as indi- 
cating the relative emphasis to be placed upon different topics. 
“2. So far as the results of our initial test justify inferences, 
they suggest that the present content of history and geography in 
the elementary school is not radically inconsistent with the need 
for geographical and historical information as revealed by a study 
of current publications; that is, the historical and geographical 
references that seem to recur most frequently in current literature 
commonly involve types of information already well represented 
in the school program. 
“3. If one were to take the newspapers and magazines of a 
single month as a basis for applying the method, one would be 
likely to get results that would make the materials taught in the 
school appear to be somewhat ill adapted to real needs; but when 
‘samplings’ of these publications are taken representing periods of 
from seven to ten years the recurring references stand out dis- 
tinctly. The actual facts to be taught in the schools should, in the 
writer’s judgment, emphasize the kind of information represented 
by these recurring references. To provide a basis for interpreting 
   
-P-A-G-E-268
  266 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
the numerous non-recurring references the pupil should be sup- 
plied with geographical principles of general applicability and with 
general methods of procedure in finding and interpreting specific 
information. The recent developments in the teaching of geogra- 
phy have certainly emphasized this type of compromise — a com- 
promise that is inevitable in framing curricula for the elementary 
and secondary schools. It is quite impossible to predict the pre- 
cise type of particular knowledge that one will need in order to 
understand the current literature of ten years hence. To limit 
our instruction to the specific information that happens to be 
necessary at the present time would be a most short-sighted 
policy, but the particular facts that have been of outstanding 
value for the past decade may reasonably be predicted to retain 
their value for some time to come. Beyond a careful impressing 
of these — using them, indeed, as a basis — it is impossible to” 
develop general principles and methods of work that will serve to 
adapt intelligence to the varying and non-recurring situations. 
“4, Tt would be reasonable to infer that, in the material which 
they furnish to their readers, newspapers are somewhat limited by 
the basis of interpretative knowledge that they may assume on the 
nart of their readers. This inference is strongly borne out by the 
results of our initial tests. In certain newspapers we found geo- 
graphical and historical references very few and far between. In 
such papers the appeal is largely upon the basis of primitive 
interests (or instincts) which can be safely assumed to be common 
to all; hence the so-called ‘sensational’ character of such journals. 
On the other hand, there are journals that presuppose a large 
capital of interpretative information among their readers, and which 
are, for this reason, commonly limited in the number of their 
readers. This is strikingly illustrated by one periodical which was 
taken over by a publisher some years ago with the avowed inten- 
tion of increasing its circulation. He succeeded admirably. We 
computed the number of historical, geographical, and literary refer- 
ences from an equal number of samplings over a period of five 
years before and five years after the magazine changed hands. 
As the circulation increased the number of references decreased,
-P-A-G-E-269
GEOGRAPHY 267 
and for some classes of references the decrease was almost pre- 
cisely in proportion to the increase in circulation. 
“5, It would appear from these suggestions that any method 
that attempts to utilize current literature as a criterion for the 
selection of educational materials should be applied with a distinct 
understanding that it may simply result in a circular form of 
reasoning: current literature of a ‘general’ nature is likely to 
represent pretty accurately the level of ‘general’ education. In 
some respects it is just as valid to infer from the content of the 
school program what the character of current literature will be as 
to infer from the character of current literature what the content 
of the school program should be. Certainly, if there is a causal 
relationship, it is from the school to current literature, and not 
vice versa.” 
§4—EssmntIALs SELECTED By STANDARDS 
(Study 38) 
Branom and Reavis* assume the functions of geography teach- 
ing to be “to impart the more important facts of conventional or 
practical value; to secure on the part of the pupil ability to inter- 
pret properly the geographic factors that enter into problems of 
timely moment, and to develop an appreciation of the importance 
of the United States intrinsically, and its relational aspects to the 
world as a whole.” 
“The realization of these aims requires a general knowledge of 
(1) the relative location of the large land and water bodies, (2) the 
location of the more important countries of the world, (3) the loca- 
tion of the more important cities of the world, (4) the physical con- 
ditions of the more important countries, (5) the occupations of the 
people and the conditions of transportation, (6) our commercial 
relations with these countries, and (7) the fundamental relation- 
ships between the physical factors and human activities. 
“Tn determining a minimal essential list of countries of the 
world, the following standards were employed: (1) the area of the 
*Seventeenth Yearbook, Part I, pp. 27-39, M. E. Branom and W. C. Reavis.
-P-A-G-E-270
268 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
country in square miles, (2) population, (3) total value of imports, 
(4) total value of imports from the United States, (5) total value 
of exports, and (6) total value of exports to the United States. 
These criteria not only offer objective data of great significance 
in the study of a particular country, but also afford a means of 
measuring the relationships of the United States to other countries. 
, “The statistical data for each of the above criteria were secured 
from the ‘Statistical Abstract of the United States’ (1915) in 
which reports covering the latest year for which statistics were 
available, for the fifty-two more important countries of the world, 
were given. The countries were ranked according to their relative 
importance with respect to each of the six criteria. 
“The fifty-two countries were then divided into quintiles under 
each of the six criteria previously discussed, and values were 
assigned to rank in the various quintiles as follows: (1) rank in 
the first quintile in each criterion received a score of 5 points; (2) 
rank in the second quintile, a score of 4 points; (3) rank in the 
third quintile, a score of 3 points; (4) rank in the fourth quintile, 
a score of 2 points; and (5) rank in the last quintile, a score of 1 
point. The total score thus received by a country would serve as 
an index of the relative importance of that country among the 
countries of the world in area, population, import and export 
trade; and of its relative importance to the United States in 
import and export trade. 
“Tn the selection of a minimal list of cities, several factors, 
such as import and export trade, advantages of location, impor- 
tance of hinterland, and advantages of transportation, were tried 
as standards; but the lack of sufficient data for many cities ren- 
dered such work unsatisfactory. A very close correlation, how- 
ever, was found to obtain between these standards in cases where 
such data were available and the single standard of population. 
It was decided, therefore, to use the standard of population as a 
eriterion for determining the list of cities. After considering the 
list of cities determined by the single standard of population, it 
was believed that the largest city of each of the 21 ‘essential’ 
countries of the world (as previously determined) should be in- 
 
-P-A-G-E-271
GEOGRAPHY 269 
cluded in the list, with the addition of all other cities of more 
than 200,000 population in the Western Hemisphere, of all other 
cities of more than 600,000 population in Europe, and of all other 
cities of more than 800,000 population in the rest of the world. 
This standard of population was established on the basis of Amer- 
ican relations to the different regions of the world. 
“This gives a list of 29 cities for the United States; 10 for the 
Western Hemisphere, exclusive of the United States; 18 for 
Europe; and 9 for Asia, Africa, Australia, and the scattered 
islands. : 
“Tn selecting a minimal list of products, dependence has been 
placed upon the value of production in the United States, supple- 
mented by the value of products imported into the United States. 
The aggregate value of a class of products may be large with 
large quantities in use, and a low price; or with small quantities 
in.use, and a high price. Neither price nor quantity is an exclusive 
index of the importance of the products to man. Ranking products 
in the order of aggregate values has the advantage of taking both 
these factors into consideration. 
“Ranking the products on the basis of the aggregate values of 
each product for all countries is desirable, but, because of unsatis- 
factory data, impracticable. Fortunately, from a somewhat dif- 
ferent point of view statistics almost as satisfactory can be ob- 
tained. Recent world events have brought out in an emphatic 
- manner the commercial dependence of every first-class power upon 
practically every part of the earth. The United States, conse- 
quently, either produces practically all important materials or 
imports them in important quantities from other producing areas. 
Hence, a consideration of the products of the United States and 
the products imported into the United States offers a comprehen- 
sive list of the world’s industrial products. 
“Tn working out the relational material, it has been assumed 
that location, area, surface features, soils, climate, distribution of 
plant and animal forms, and distribution of minerals are the sig- 
nificant physical factors.”

§5—A Snort Cur In TABULATION 
(Study 39) 
An extended study of the items of place geography referred to 
in the first October number of The Literary Digest in alternate years 
from 1899 to 1918, inclusive, was made by Charters and members 
of a seminar. The object was primarily to examine methods of 
analysis. |
-P-A-G-E-273
GEOGRAPHY 271 
For purposes of the study, advertisements, maps, and lists of 
places were omitted, while cartoons were included because they are 
essential parts of reading matter widely used to make ideas clear. 
In this analysis geographic names (as England) were at once 
included. Then it was decided to add the names of people (as 
English) since to obtain a gauge of the importance of a country, 
mention of the activities of the inhabitants was as important as 
mention of the country, and in any event the name of the people 
could awkwardly, but logically, be changed to a statement of the 
name of the country, as by substituting the people of England for 
the English. Following this line of reasoning it was found that the 
people of a country were frequently referred to by nicknames, as 
Yankee, Hun, etc. It was further found that one could not omit, 
proper adjectives (as the American navy); and, to make the list 
complete, pronouns would have to be included when reference was 
made to peoples or countries. For instance, in ‘The American 
nation and its associates,” if American is included as a reference, 
obviously zts would have to be in a complete enumeration of 
references. : 
One large source of difficulty was the disposition to make of 
“distributed terms.’”’ For instance, the term “Allies” and “Triple 
Entente” would necessarily need to be distributed among the 
countries included in the terms, because, if the term was important, 
the nations which constituted the groups were of enough impor- 
tance in world affairs to receive a tally in the total findings. Terms 
such as the Western States required a careful reading of the con- 
text and the consultation of authoritative geographies, dictionaries, 
and encyclopedias before exact distribution could be made, and 
a few terms were so indefinite as to escape distribution by any 
methods which were found. Every reference was tabulated (in 
contra-distinction to one reference per paragraph or article as is 
the rule in some studies). This was done because of the effort to 
obtain a complete analysis. Places of the most minute sort, as 
the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, were included. Rivers, mountain 
ranges, lakes, bays, channels, gulfs, seas, and oceans were not 
included. 
 
-P-A-G-E-274
  272 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
On the basis of this claeaifiation the totals for all numbers of 
The Literary Digest were calculated. The references by continents 
were: North America, 3112; Europe, 1835; Asia, 597; Africa, 
190; South America, 38; and Australia, 28; total, 5800. 
The most frequent references by countries were, for the first 20: 
United States, 2712; British Isles, 725; Germany, 257; France, 
205; Japan, 202; China, 136; Russia, 121; Italy, 108; Turkey, 
82; Canada, 78; India, 73; Mexico, 61; Russia, 57; Transvaal, 
54; Turkey, 43; Orange Free State, 34; Spain, 33; Austro- 
Hungary, 32; Congo Free State, 23; and Greece, 23. 
An attempt was then ae to determine whether the same 
rankings of countries could be obtained by the use of fewer than 
six items: (1) geographical names, (2) names of people, (3) nick- 
names, (4) proper adjectives, (5) pronouns, and (6) distributed 
terms. To this end, several correlations were made, using the 
Spearman foot rule. The correlation between the rankings obtained 
by the totals with that obtained by the use of geographical names 
alone was .95; a second correlation between the total and the 
sum of geographical names and names of people was found to be 
.98; but in both of these correlations nine of the sixty-six countries 
did not appear. The correlations between rankings of all items 
and those derived from geographical names and distributed terms 
is only .90. Finally, a correlation between the rankings obtained 
in the totals with those obtained by combining geographical names, 
names of people and distributed terms was calculated and found 
to be .99 with all countries represented. 
This is so nearly a perfect correlation that for. practical pur- 
poses it appears that in making such an analysis to determine 
relative emphasis it is sufficient to include only the three iteras.

VOCATIONAL COURSES 
(Studies 40-46) 
§1—IntrRopucTION 
The studies that have been made in the field of vocationa “ (E 
education are more varied than are those that have been made in 
any other field, and more complete than in any except spelling. 
They include investigations of the machinists’ trade, the occupa- 
tion of salesmanship, and that of sheep husbandry. A course in 
commercial engineering, based upon extensive job-analysis, has 
been made, and two studies into the objective bases of manual 
arts courses. 
The studies in the machinists’ trade include a complete course 
in the shop work and the subjects related thereto. For sales- 
people control elements are set up and the material is gathered 
from many sources. In sheep husbandry a cycle calendar of 
operations for the year is determined, and all the methods for 
handling them are gathered together, and to this are added the 
basic facts which give this information its scientific validity. In 
commercial engineering, job-analyses of executives’ duties are 
made and the information necessary for performing them is de- 
rived, after which it is arranged in a four-year course with credit 
hours and a yearly program provided. One of the studies in 
manual arts lists all the construction projects that farmers carry 
out, while the second study does this for home repairs and takes 
the additional step of determining the tool processes involved in 
each project. 
In accomplishing these results, service mathematics is worked 
out for the machinists’ trade and service science for sheep hus- 
bandry.

collecting methods of solving the problems listed as topics, giving 
the basic sources for the solutions, arranging the material in

to determine the working units. This is the one single study 
which carries the steps of curriculum construction through from 
beginning to end.

Allen* has derived curricula in mathematics, drawing, and

The method used is to analyze each process into its subordinate 
operations and determine for each subordinate part the informa- 
tion necessary to its performance. The plan of procedure can best 
be shown by a sample page of the Drilling Chart. 
For our purposes attention needs to be paid to all the items. 
Checking level is meant to indicate the relative complexity of the 
operations, number one being simpler than number two. Objective 
describes what the operative can do when he has mastered item 
number one. Type job specifications is a description of the sub- 
ordinate operations. Auailiary information refers to the technical 
shop names of tools and operations. Trade mathematics, trade 
drawing, and trade science indicate the items of each necessary for 
carrying on the job in an intelligent manner. 
It will be observed that in the column marked “Trade Mathe- 
matics,” for instance, there is found a list of all mathematics 
needed for all the operations, and so for drawing and science. This 
gives the complete curriculum. It shows what denominate num- 
bers are used, the fractions, integers, fundamental operations, and 
so forth.

276 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
To these applied items will be added other elementary items 
which are necessary for the understanding of each. Consequently 
the curriculum in each will consist of both applied items and 
elementary items which, when determined, will give a complete 
curriculum. 
When these have been determined, the organization of the 
curriculum will be further modified by two methods of teaching. 
If the items are taught incidentally along with the operation by 
holding up the operation while the derived mathematical or scien- 
tific items are being taught, the curriculum will need no further 
modification. It is arranged in the proper order as it stands. 
However, if the derived subject is taught at another time, ante- 
cedent to or parallel with the operations of the job, it is advisable 
and probably necessary to alter the order of the items in the interest 
of simplicity or logical relations. Instead of teaching linear meas- 
urement first it may be preferable or necessary to begin with the 
fundamental operations or at some other point. 
This Allen has done in the case of each of the derived subjects. 
To illustrate, we may select the first item of General Trade Mathe- 
matics. 
This unfortunately sets no definite limits to the operations 
which could be wisely done.’ It shows the relations to school 
methods; it gives special methods of calculation; it furnishes 
auxiliary information and suggestions for teaching. 
The mathematics necessary consists of addition, as shown; sub- 
traction of whole numbers by ordinary methods; multiplication 
of whole numbers with the aid of four-place logarithm tables and 
slide rule; division of whole numbers by the use of the four-place 
logarithm tables and slide rule; powers and roots, square, cube, 
and any root, with the use of the slide rule, logarithm tables and| 
tables of powers and roots; addition of pure fractions and mixed 
numbers with fractional denominators of 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and 
128, by the aid of a scale or foot rule, fractions by use of highest} 
denominator and tables of equivalent fractions; subtraction of| 
fractions by use of scale and of largest denominator; decimals to}

mating; and multiplication of fractions. 
This shows the comparatively narrow range of the mathematics. 
required, a characteristic common also to drawing and science. 
§3—Dertaitep DERIVATION 
(Study 41) 
A considerably greater amount of detail is shown in the follow- 
ing excerpts from an unpublished study by B. W. Noel of St. 
Louis. While Allen gives a general description of what is 
done, Noel in the following three fragments indicates what the 
operations are in detail sufficient for the description to carry itself 
without teaching. 
(1) In machine-shop operations one of the minor objectives is 
the computation of the revolutions per minute (R. P. M.) for cut- 
ting stock of different diameters and of different materials. In 
this case the first step is the analysis of the processes involved, 
which are as follows:      
   
       
     
      “Use formula R. P. M. _ where R. P.M. = revolutions per 
minute, K =a constant, and d = diameter of the part of the| 
material being cut. 
“A. Find K. 
“T. Select cutting speed of the tool. 
“(a) Depends upon the material being cut, kind of tool, 
depth of cut, amount of feed, ete. 
“(1) Consult handbook for tables of cutting speed: 
for different materials. 
“(b) Reduce cutting speed in feet to cutting speed i 
inches. 
“(c) Find the circumference of a piece of stock 1” i 
diameter. 
“(d) Divide the cutting speed in inches by 3%, th 
circumference of a piece of steel 1” in diameter 
“ Answer = 
*B.-Find RiPiM.
-P-A-G-E-281
VOCATIONAL COURSES 279 
“T. Substitute value of K and of d in the formula 
R.P.M.=— 
“TI. Divide the value of K by the value of d. 
“The degree of accuracy in the result requires only a whole 
number.” 
If from these operations we draw off the mathematics required 
we find the following: To understand the first item the student 
needs to have enough acquaintance with substitution formulas to 
know what they are and to understand the meaning of a constant. 
None is needed for AI a. For AIb he must know how to re- 
duce feet to inches. For AIc he must know the meaning of 
1” and of 3.1416, and the more erudite fact that the circumference 
is 3.1416 times the diameter. For A Id he must know how to 
divide a whole number (the cutting speed) by 3.1416, or, as an 
alternative, how to reduce 3.1416 to its equivalent (for shop’ pur- 
poses) 3%, and then to divide a whole number by 3%. For 
BI he must know how to substitute arithmetical quantities for 
the symbols, and for B II he must know how to perform the 
necessary division. 
No ability to speak or write English correctly is necessary for 
this operation, and in “science’’ only a few elemental facts are 
necessary. For A I he needs to know the kinds of steel, and for 
A Ia 1 he must have some familiarity with the arm speed. Finally, 
the formula R. P.M. se based upon the fundamental fact that 
the R. P. M.’s of two wheels having the same surface speed vary 
inversely as their diameters. 
In this case the last of these items is basic in the negative sense 
that the operation could be carried on without any knowledge of 
it by the operator and in the positive sense that the formula is 
based upon it. All of the other items are necessary for the suc- 
cessful completion of the operation. 
As an illustration of the method by which the items of the 
fundamental subjects are derived from the analyzed processes 
involved in controlling the objective, the following will serve. As 
 
-P-A-G-E-282
280 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
said above, it differs from Allen in the greater detail with which 
the exact range of content is described so that curriculum limits 
may be set concerning the degree of complexity of operations 
which must be taught. 
In this process of derivation the items of the related and funda- 
mental subjects are drawn off one by one without organization 
within the subjects. The order in which the mathematics was 
drawn off in the illustration above was first a substitution formula 
and a constant, then the reduction of feet to inches, followed by 
the determination of the circumference, the diameter being given, 
and so forth. Obviously, this is neither a logical nor a pedagogical 
organization. As a result of this it is necessary to collect all the 
items and classify them in some adequate order. For instance, 
in turning a cylinder (1 inch in diameter and 6 inches long between 
centers) a classification of the mathematics involved is made 
in Table I: 
If a course of study in mathematics were constructed to show 
exactly what of the foregoing material should be taught, it would 
consist of items found in Table II. (This constitutes the raw 
material of a course based upon this fragmentary job. That it 
may be taught efficiently it is still necessary to arrange it in proper 
instructional order)

§4—-MeERcHANDISE INFORMATION 
(Study 42) 
The problem of collecting merchandise information to be made 
available for the use of salespeople was studied by Miss Elizabeth 
Dyer and the writer. The question to be answered is, What 
information should salespeople have about the merchandise which 
they sell? The practical difficulty faced is that of the proper selec- 
tion of information so that enough will be given to meet the needs 
of the salespeople, but not more than enough. 
In order to answer this question, it was necessary to set up 
control elements, delimit the field, and collect the information. 
The methods used can be illustrated from a textile study. 
(1) The first step taken was to list all the articles made of 
textile fibers which are carried in seven department stores. This 
constituted a very large number. 
(2) The second step was to examine the articles and list the 
different raw materials (fibers) and fabrics used in each article. 
This list was found to contain sixty-four fabrics of one kind or 
another. These two steps provided the investigators with the 
materials to which attention needed to be given. 
(3) The third step was to determine the values which cus- 
tomers looked for when they were purchasing textile fabrics. 
These were discovered by several methods. One method was that 
of collecting many hundred questions which customers ask when 
they are buying. The second method was to interview customers, 
of whom some seventy were seen. The majority of these were 
married, kept house, and had children. There were also included 
stenographers, secretaries, teachers, and some students. As a 
result of this it was found that consumers are interested in the 
following six classes of values: They are concerned about the 
beauty or appearance of the material, or article; about the style; 
the becomingness; the serviceability or durability; and the com- 
fort, as, for instance, the use of cotton in summer and wool in 
winter. Finally, they are interested in sentiment, by which is 
meant the satisfaction which a customer obtains from knowing 
 
-P-A-G-E-288

286 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
that she owns something which is imported, rare, and expensive, 
although the difference between such articles and others more 
common may not be apparent to most other persons. 
Superficially it would seem that the customer is also interested 
in price, but fundamentally this is not accurate, for the reason 
that she wants to obtain the largest amount of the values which 
she considers to be most important for the least amount of money. 
If, for instance, she is more interested in serviceability than in any 
other quality, she then seeks to purchase materials which possess 
the greatest amount of value for the money which she feels that 
she can spend. 
(4) When these values had been classified, a study was made 
to determine the classes of merchandise information upon which 
these values depend. This revealed five important classes. One 
or another of these values is dependent upon the fiber, the char- 
acter of the yarn, the construction of the cloth, the finishing 
process, and supply and demand. 
The following chart shows the problem graphically:

in the rectangle formed by the intersection of the columns headed 
“Fibers” and “Style.” All facts concerning the relation of yarn 
to serviceability were likewise inserted in the rectangle formed by 
the intersection of the columns under the headings “Yarn” and 
“Serviceability.”” In this way it was possible to obtain the mini- 
mum essentials of merchandise facts which are useful in explaining 
values to salespeople and to customers. 
The information was collected from several sources, as follows: 
textbooks, buyers, assistant buyers, expert salespeople, mills, fac- 
tories, home-economics teachers, advertisements, and experienced 
customers. 
(6) The material was then organized for use; this meant that 
it had to be divided according to departments, because the sales- 
person in the suit department must have different information 
from one of the people in the yard goods. As a result a basic 
manual was prepared for use by high school students who have 
not yet selected the departments in which to work, and merchan- 
dise manuals for specific departments were drawn off from this 
master manual. This resulted in a general manual and in several 
departmental manuals. 
(7) After the material was collected and organized in this form, 
it was checked by experts in textiles in order to see that the infor- 
mation was correct. ‘ 
(8) For instructional purposes in the stores the material was 
then thrown into the form of question and answer, because of the 
fact that salespeople are not “eye-minded” and will not read 
material if they have to dig out the ideas for themselves. Finally, 
it was used and checked to see whether it was within the compre- 
hension of salespeople and reached the level of their working units. 
§5—A Surrp Huspanpry CURRICULUM 
(Study 48) 
J. H. Greene, in an unpublished thesis, The Construction of a 
Project Curriculum in Sheep Husbandry (University of Illinois), 
constructed a project curriculum following the annual cycle of sheep 
husbandry. The cycle was divided into the following problems:
-P-A-G-E-290

288 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
(1) Should I raise sheep? (2) Location, selection, and purchase 
of breeding stock. (3) Getting the animals into breeding condi- 
tion and breeding them. (4) Preparing winter quarters and laying 
in a stock of feed. (5) Caring for pregnant ewes. (6) Preparing 
for lambing. (7) Caring for the ewe and the lamb at lambing time. 
(8) Starting the lambs on feed, docking, and castrating them. 
(9) Providing early pasture; shearing the flock and caring for and 
selling the wool. (10) Caring for the flock on pasture. (11) Wean- 
ing the lambs and selling the surplus stock. 
Each problem is subdivided into “sub-problems” of which the 
following is typical: 
Problem: Docking and castrating lambs and starting them on 
feed. 
Sub-problems: 1. Docking lambs 
2. Castrating male lambs 
3. Starting lambs on feed 
4. Keeping records. 
The sub-problems are solved one by one and basic facts upon 
which the solutions depended are given. Table I is a complete 
tabular statement of sub-problems 3 and is typical of the treatment 
of all problems. It will be noted that the column headed Solutions 
gives information about the procedure, while the column headed 
Basic Facts gives the reasons for the procedure. In some cases 
there is no reason except consensus of sheep experts, while in 
others experimental evidence is available. 
From the column “Basic Facts’? Greene has selected all those 
in the whole study which can be labeled chemistry, physics, and 
zodlogy. He finds six in zodlogy; life history of stomach worm, 
sheep louse, sheep tick, maggot fly, tape worm, and sheep bat fly. 
Six are included in chemistry: carbon dioxide cycle, nitrogen cycle, 
classes of food nutrients, carrying of oxygen by the blood, use of 
litmus paper in testing soil, and sodium chlorate. Physics is rep- 
resented by five items: osmosis, heat conduction, adhesion, capil- 
larity, and vaporization. 
In addition to determining the content of the curriculum he 
taught it to see whether he had reduced it to the level of the work-

3 1. When lambs are from 8 tol 16 days old the following 
mixture is recommended:

Wheat bran, 1 part 
Only a very small amount of grain

should be fed. a. It is better to give them (lambs) about the amount 
of feed they will clean up 
in a day than to place a large quantity before them 
to nose over and spoil. The 
wheat bran is very essential 
to this mixture because it contains the mineral matter 
the growing lamb needs, and being somewhat like a 
roughage it adds bulk to the ration and aids in develop- 
ing capacity for feed. The hulls from the oats serve 
the same purpose.—Cof- 
fey,—Prod. Sheep Husb., 
pp. 272 and 274. 
“In experiments at the Wisconsin Station it was 
found that lambs fed grain 
up to ten months old reached a given weight four to seven 
weeks sooner than when no 
grain was fed before weaning time, and the lambs were 
ready for the market at any 
time during this period, so 
that advantage might betaken 
of favorable market condi- 
tions. In experiments with different grain feeds for un- 
weaned Shropshire lambs, for periods averaging ten weeks, 
0. 3 to 0.4 pound of grain was eaten daily, with resulting laverage gains of about one- 
half pound per head dail; 
'The following amounts of di 
ferent grain feeds were re- 
quired per 100 pounds of gain in body weight: wheat bran, 
71 pounds; corn meal (4 
trials), 74° pounds; whole oats, 78 pounds; and cracked 
eas, 81 pounds. Unweaned 
lambs that go into the breed- 
ing flock should receive feed 
like oats and peas, wheat or 
bran, while corn is preferable 
for lambs intended for the 
butcher, as it tends to produce

ing units of a group. The procedure was as follows: A group of 
farmer boys in the ninth and tenth grades was selected in a small 
high school which by mental test was found to consist of pupils of 
average intelligence, the boys representing a fair sampling of the 
school. To give the curriculum a thorough test he wrote up the 
tabular material, a sample of which is given above, in textbook 
form, and placed it in the hands of the students. Before each 
problem was presented the students were formally tested by pre- 
pared questions to see what they already knew about the subject. 
The problem was then raised and the chapter in the text given 
to the pupils. At the close of the treatment of each major problem 
a test of equal difficulty was given and the improvement noted. 
To obtain an additional check, the students were put into a 
hypercritical attitude after the test was given and asked to care- 
fully criticize the text for difficulties and obscurities, to see if it 
had been reduced to their working units. This criticism, with the 
criticism of the author as he taught, was used to modify and clarify 
the text. 
To assist in the criticism the pupils were asked to keep a diary 
in which they recorded facts according to the following outlines: 
“Members of the class are to write a book on sheep husbandry, 
based on study and practical experience. The instructor will help 
to supply some facts; others will be found in books and be obtained 
‘rom the practical experience of sheep men and of students. 
“A. Be sure you understand every word in the text as you read. 
Underline all words you do not understand. 
“B. Be sure you record: 
“1, Every word you do not understand. 
“2. Every additional explanation found in another book or 
explained by a sheep man, a farmer, or the instructor. 
“3, Every observation as to how the ‘Solutions’ succeed.” 
The study of the text showed that very little material of con- 
sequence had been omitted in its original construction. In getting 
back to working units, the life history of the stomach worm and 
some practical facts concerning the economic returns from western 
ewes were found necessary in helping the pupils to solve the prob-

lem: ‘The Kind of Breeding Ewes to be Purchased.’ In the 
preparation of the test the discussion of the phenomenon of birth 
seemed to render prerequisite a preliminary treatment of the 
anatomy of the reproductive organs of the ewe, a discussion not 
included in the original curriculum, and a threatened outbreak of 
hemorrhagic septicemia made this consideration actually neces- 
sary. The foregoing modifications were practically the only im- 
portant ones made. Many words were used which were not intel- 
ligible to the class and a glossary would have been a very valuable 
and necessary addition. 
§6—A CommurciAL ENGINEERING CURRICULUM 
(Study 44) 
Strong* bases a curriculum for executives of production, build- 
ing construction, and printing upon a job analysis. 
“Let me trace for you the steps which have been employed 
during the last seven months in working out the contents of certain 
curricula designed to train men to become executives in the three 
fields of building construction, printing, and production. 
“A staff of fourteen men spent the summer in making careful 
job analyses of six production companies, five printing companies, 
and twenty-seven building construction companies. Most of the 
latter were very small, involving only one, two, or three executives 
each. In nearly all of these companies a job analysis was made of 
the duties of each executive from foreman to president, inclusive. 
The companies were selected so as to represent as wide a variety 
of features as possible. Thus we studied in each of the three fields 
the largest company in this district and one of the smallest; we 
studied companies with mass production and with specialized pro- 
duction; companies truly typical of the field and companies on 
the boundary line; etc. 
“Our job analyses contained six parts. First we listed the

duties of the position—what the executive did. Second, we noted 
the essential qualifications—that is, what he had-to know in 
order to perform those duties. Third, we added the qualifications 
not essential but of value. Here were recorded such groups of in- 
formation as the executive himself pointed out that he ought to 
possess to handle his job better, or such as appeared to the investi- 
gator to be of value to the executive. Command of English was 
a. frequent entry under this heading. Fourth, the route to the job 
the official had himself pursued. Fifth, the probable line of pro- 
motion. In most cases this was not known to the executive, and 
in many cases it was not clear to anyone in the company. Sixth, 
recommendations and notes of any sort. 
“Let me illustrate these six points by giving the first three or 
four items under these six headings from a job analysis of a super- 
intendent of a pattern shop. 
“1, Duties of Position: 
““(a) Supervises the work of about seventy men and takes 
the responsibility for the correctness and accuracy 
of both the pattern-maker and the checker. 
““(p) Selects work to be given men according to their natural 
ability and training. 
““(e) Studies drawings sent in to see that the principles 
embodied are sound from the standpoint of pattern 
construction, moulding, and casting. For example, 
areas of sections may be so proportioned that undue 
shrinkage stresses will be set up during the cooling 
of the casting. 
““(d) Secures cost estimates from jobbing pattern shops and 
decides whether it is more economical (considering 
here the time element) to have patterns made out- 
side or in own department, etc. 
«2. Essential qualifications: 
““(a) Must be a first-class pattern-maker. 
““b) Must know the traits and abilities of each man, 
whether always inclined to work slowly and accur-

ately, or whether able to judge when accuracy may 
be sacrificed without detriment for the sake of 
speed. (May get into difficulty with the cost office 
through assigning the wrong man to a particular 
piece of work.) 
““(c) Must be expert in reading drawings in order to visual- 
ize patterns in detail, the relationship of parts, the 
placement of cores, and the appearance of the mould 
when finished. 
““(d) Must be able to calculate cost of construction of pat- 
tern, etc. 
“3, Qualifications not essential but of value: 
““(a) Calculation of weight of castings from drawings. 
““(b) Some knowledge of chemistry and metallurgy for in- 
formation during discussions in conferences, etc. 
“4, Route to the job: 
““(a) Finished eighth grade. 
““(b) Worked in foundry about eight months. 
““(e) In drawing room about three months. 
““(d) In pattern shop, chiefly on loam sweep work, about 
five years. 
“(e) During this time attended school at night taking draw- 
ing and mechanical engineering. Also did a great 
deal of home study, particularly on drawing, receiv- 
ing instruction from his father, who was a superin- 
tendent of a pattern department. 
“5, Line of promotion: 
““(a) Not definitely marked. 
“<6, Recommended by executive: 
““(a) Since the average age of men finishing a four-year 
technical course is twenty-two years, they are too 
oid to train the memory for the details connected 
with the work. They should start at not later than 
about sixteen years of age.’
-P-A-G-E-297
VOCATIONAL COURSES 295 
“So much for how we gathered our data. Now how are we 
using the data to improve our existing curricula? 
“We have gone through all our job analyses and noted down 
every item that pertains, for example, to the subject of English. 
All of these details have been carefully studied and finally sum- 
marized. Here is our conclusion as to the function of English in 
our Production Course. 
“English is to be taught in order that the student will be 
enabled to do five things: 
“1. To express more or less technical ideas in a form which 
will secure the attention and action of another executive. 
(This seems to require, among other things, training in 
the handling of topic sentences, avoidance of ambiguous 
expressions, the expression of ideas in their logical order, 
and the emphasis and forceful expression of important 
points.) 
“<2.To write letters of all kinds, such as acknowledgments, 
inquiries, claims, and complaints. 
“«3.To express himself orally in conversation with workmen, 
officials, customers, and the general public. 
“‘4. To express himself orally in conferences and public meet- 
ings, either from the floor or in the capacity of presiding 
officer. (This seems to require, among other things, 
practice in extemporaneous speaking and drill in ‘“‘Rob- 
ert’s Rules of Order” so that the presentation of ideas 
will not be interfered with through lack of confidence or 
the inability to cope with parliamentary technicalities.) 
«¢5.To write technical specifications according to established 
standards so that they may briefly, but fully, cover the 
subject and be easily understood.’ 
“In addition to these five objectives which we should like to 
hold the English Department responsible for putting over, we have 
 
-P-A-G-E-298
  296 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
three other objectives somewhat closely related but yet outside 
any existing English Department today. These three are: 
“1 To compile statistics in economical ways and to evaluate 
statistical results and present conclusions in a clear and 
interesting manner. (This seems to require, among 
other things, familiarity with methods of statistical 
tabulation, such as the Hollorith machine, with concep- 
tions of probability and correlation, and the like.) 
«2. To express statistical facts in the form of curves, diagrams, 
and charts, as well as to understand and interpret them. 
(Much of this should be established in college algebra, 
in drawing, and in the writing-up of laboratory notes.) 
“¢3.To take an assigned problem, collect proper data, draw 
valid conclusions, express facts and conclusions in con- 
cise and interesting form, and fit the whole into a report 
so as to meet the idiosyncrasies of an executive or the 
interests of the general public.’ 
“These eight objectives make up very clearly and without 
question the second most important and second most common func- 
tion of all executives from foremen to president, whether in building 
construction, printing, or production. The most common and 
most important function, I might say in passing, is that of handling 
men. These two stand head and shoulders above all other func- 
tions. Yet there is scarcely a course in the country on the han- 
dling of men and very little attention is given to English in our 
technical curricula — that little hardly meeting any one of these 
eight objectives outlined above.” 
The material so collected was presented to a central committee 
composed of all faculty members concerned and was referred to 
the departments which would deal with each of the subjects — 
mathematics to the mathematics department, chemistry to the 
chemistry department, etc. These departments were asked to 
organize or reorganize a course to meet the objectives revealed by 
the job analysis, and to report their results to the central com-
-P-A-G-E-299

mittee. The content of all the subjects has been determined, the 
number of hours to be devoted to each, and the year in which 
each shall be taught. In other words, the study has been carried 
through all the stages from job-analysis to schedule-making. 
§7—A Farm Suor Course 
(Study 45) 
Struck* investigated four questions as follows: 
“1. What kinds of construction work do farmers perform in 
wood, concrete, and iron and steel? 
“2. What kinds of repair work do farmers perform in the same 
materials? 
“3. What kinds of construction work in the materials men- 
. tioned do farmers leave to expert mechanics such as 
carpenters, concrete workers, and blacksmiths? 
“4, What kinds of repair work in the same materials do farmers 
leave to expert mechanics? 
“The data for Part I of the study were secured from four hun- 
dred farmers who are distributed in thirty of the thirty-three com- 
munities of the State in which rural community vocational schools 
and vocational agricultural departments in high schools were in 
operation during the school year 1918-1919. 
“Tt was deemed advisable to secure the data desired from the 
farmers through the pupils in the schools concerned. In order to 
accomplish this, personal visits were made to all of the schools. 
These visits were made in the course of two months, at the rate of 
four or five schools per week. In two cases slightly less than half a 
day was spent in the schools; in two other cases two days were 
spent in the schools; in the remainder the time spent varied from 
a half to a whole day. Owing to the topography of the State; and 
to distances traveled, it was not feasible to visit more than five

schools per week. During the visits, printed questionnaires were 
distributed among the pupils, and were then carefully explained 
to both teachers and pupils. Pupils were asked, provided they 
lived on farms, to take the questionnaires to their fathers or to 
friends who were farmers. The pupils were further asked to ex- 
plain the questionnaires to whoever was to fill them out and to 
render assistance where it seemed advisable in the mechanics of 
scoring the questionnaires. Upon being filled out, the latter were 
in all cases first returned to the respective schools, in order that 
they might serve as a basis for discussion and for action in con- 
nection with the educational work affected. Later the question- 
naires were sent to the writer.” 
Unfortunately, no statement is given of the method of obtaining 
the original lists or of the form of the questionnaire. | 
“The information secured from the farmers was grouped in | 
three distinct ways: 
“1, In view of the fact that over 70 per cent of the farming 
in the State is of the general farming type, it was thought 
advisable to group all of the data secured in the first 
classification; namely, on the basis of all farms studied. 
It is believed that the facts brought out in this classifi- 
cation closely fit conditions in the entire State. It may 
be argued that poultry-raising is quite different from 
dairying, but the former, as a distinct type of agriculture, 
is found on only half of one per cent of the farms. 
“2. The data secured were next grouped on the basis of the 
ages of the farmers, giving the information in order to 
show a possible relationship between age and the kind 
or variety of repair and construction work performed. 
“3, The information was grouped according to the type of 
farming pursued, in order to see if this has a material 
influence on the kind or variety of repair and construc- 
tion work undertaken by farmers.  
-P-A-G-E-301
VOCATIONAL COURSES 299 
“Tn presenting the data secured from the farmers, the following 
distinctions have been made: 
“1. Construction work in a given material is taken to mean 
‘making’ work. It also includes repair work when per- 
formed on the objects originally constructed by farmers, 
as it is assumed that with a possible few exceptions more 
skill is required to make an object than to repair it. 
“2. ‘Repair work’ includes only the repair work done on 
objects not made by farmers. It will be kept in mind 
that the actual amount of repair work done is greater 
than shown in this classification as explained in the pre- 
ceding paragraph. 
“3. Work done by expert mechanics is that work which farmers 
leave to men who follow vocations such as that of car- 
penter, concrete worker, and blacksmith.” 
The ten most common kinds of construction work with their 
frequency per thousand farms were: wire fence (710), nests for 
laying hens (672), chicken coop (645), milking stool (642), nest 
for setting hens (640), farm gate (612), jockey stick (517), hammer 
handle (512), feeding trough for chicks (452), pig pen (445). 
The ten most common kinds of repair work in wood with their 
frequency per thousand farms were: door screen (235), wheel- 
barrow (232), rail fence (185), window screen (185), horse manger 
(182), cattle manger (182), bins for grain (172), wire fence (170), 
wagon box (167), horse barn (160). 
The ten most common kinds of work in wood done by expert 
mechanics with their frequency per thousand farms were: com- 
bination barn (192), kitchen sink (152), poultry house (132), dairy 
barn (122), horse barn (97), kitchen cabinet (90), door screen (87), 
kitchen table (87), privy (85), hog house (82). 
The eight most common kinds of construction work in con- 
erete done by farmers with frequency per thousand were: Floor 
(310), foundation (270), walk (220), cellar (170), steps (170), 
watering trough (135), gutter (117). 
   
-P-A-G-E-302
  The nine most common kinds of repair work in concrete were: 
Cellar (47), floor (45), foundation (40), steps (32), walk (80), 
silo (30), cistern (25), fence post (25), gutter (20). 
The five most common kinds of construction work in concrete 
done by mechanics were: Cellar (130), cistern (122), walk (102), 
floor (92), silo (87). 
The seven most common kinds of work done by farmers in 
iron and steel with frequency per hundred were: Chain link (7), 
gate hook (7), chain hook (6), singletree hook (6), clevis (6), ring 
(6), staple (6). 
The material was further classified according to the kinds of 
construction and repair done by farmers of different ages and upon 
different types of farm. 
No analysis of the jobs into processes as in Fuller’s study 
was made, probably because the investigator assumed that the 
work would be taught by the project method. ]

§8—Manvat Arts Basep on Home Repair

Fuller* undertook ‘to determine what problems and processes 
would be involved in a manual arts course, based upon work 
which is done or may be done around the home by a handy man 
with a common carpenter’s and painter’s tools. The problems 
of investigation were: first, to discover the jobs; second, to list 
and classify them; and third, to determine what processes were 
involved. 
“The method of procedure in the investigation was as follows: 
“1, By personal interviews with fifty people, I made a prelim- 
inary list of the things which they in their own experience had had 
to do or have done about the house. These people consisted of 
housewives of Columbia, Missouri, school teachers from various 
sections of the State who were attending summer school, real es- 
tate and rental men of Columbia, and business men. In conduct-

VOCATIONAL COURSES 301 
ing these interviews I explained what I wanted and asked the 
people to take twenty or thirty minutes to go into the matter in 
detail. At first I helped a little by asking if this or that had ever 
needed repairing and usually they took great pains to recall every- 
thing. When we had gone as far as we could, I asked specifically 
about other things which were mentioned previously by someone. 
“2. I supplemented these interviews by personal inspection of 
twelve houses — in many cases the dwellings of the people I had 
interviewed. Using a list of two hundred items, I made a com- 
plete survey, in a small rural community of Missouri, of the prob- 
lems of household construction and repair. In this way I reached 
the point where additional inspection or additional conversation 
added only an occasional item to the list. 
“3. All the items were then grouped under general headings 
of painting, furniture repair, house repair in general, house repair 
inside, doors, windows, screens, general repair, shoe repair, sharp- 
ening, plumbing and metal work, and new things made for the 
house. In all there were 328 items. These were printed with 
the following directions. (The first section in painting is also 
included to show the form used.) 
“DIRECTIONS 
“Our purpose 
“To find out what has to be done about the house, the 
doing of which requires the use of tools. 
“What you are asked to do 
“First: Examine carefully the following list of things which 
are suggested as possible things to be done. 
“«Second: Take the list and with the help of your parents 
or the landlady examine the house in which you live. Under- 
score all things which need to be done. Also underscore all

things which you, your parents, or landlady recall have been 
done in this house or any other house ith which you, or they, 
have been acquainted. 
“«Third: Write in the blank space provided all those things 
which need to be done or have been done, which are not found 
in this list. This is especially important, as we wish to make 
this list as complete as possible. 
“‘Pourth: Please fill this out tonight. Mark as directed 
above. Have sheets fastened together. Bring them to your 
first class tomorrow. Lay them on the teacher’s desk as you 
enter. 
“Painting 
“Paint house, paint outbuildings, paint repairs, paint 
screens, paint interior woodwork, paint floor, paint gutter, 
paint tin roof, tint walls, enamel bed, varnish furniture, stain 
furniture, patch scarred varnish, remove varnish, varnish 
woodwork, varnish floors, shellac floors, oil floors, wax floors, 
clean and oil furniture, polish furniture, apply wood filler.’ 
“These questionnaires were presented in person to the students 
at assemblies in the Columbia High School, the University High 
School, and to the college students in the university shops. In 
all 430 blanks were used and returned. The frequency of mention 
of each job was then determined as shown in Table I for the ‘first 
54 jobs. 
“ Assuming for purposes of study that these jobs would deter- 
mine the content of a manual arts course, two alternatives pre- 
sented themselves. First, the course might be taught as a project 
or home-project course, and the students might be given the jobs 
to do at home or in the shop. Or, second, the tool processes neces- 
sary to perform these jobs might be drawn off the jobs and the 
tool processes might be taught systematically or by the problem 
method. Of these two the second alternative was selected; and a 
type of analysis is shown in Table II.

          “Tn Table I a standard is found for judging the practical value 
of the common manual arts course for the communities studied. 
That there is little similarity between the two is remarkably clear. 
As one runs over the list it is noticeable that fewer than half the 
processes are taught either as projects or in elementary form in 
the present courses. If home repair and construction were the 
objectives of the manual arts course, then present courses would 
need to be radically changed. For instance, painting, including 
puttying holes, filling, mixing, applying, and removing paint, should 
be taught. 
“In Table III are shown the processes involved in performing
-P-A-G-E-309
VOCATIONAL COURSES 307 
the 54 jobs listed in Table 1. In order that all processes listed be 
determined, all the jobs are analyzed in terms of processes not 
only of woodworking, but also of painting, etc. 
“When these have been derived it is possible to determine the 
relative frequency of each process. This has been done in Table 
IV, which shows that planing occurs ten times in the 54 jobs. 
Upon such a basis it would be possible to determine the more or 
less commonly used processes so that relative emphasis might be 
determined. It should be noted that the first 31 processes are 
those commonly taught in school shops. The remainder are not 
usually found in any manual arts course now in use. It is appar- 
ent that if home repair and construction be made the basis for a 
course in manual arts, it is not necessary to use the project method. 
For once the processes have been derived, it is a matter of choice 
as to whether they be taught systematically and in isolation from 
practical jobs as projects at home, or as problems in the shop. The 
important point to bear in mind is that it is entirely practicable 
to draw off the processes from home projects and determine 
which of them to teach and emphasize.” 
For purposes of curriculum construction Fuller’s advance in 
analysis over that of Struck is significant. By Fuller’s method it 
is possible to determine the frequency of the technical processes 
and thereby to safeguard the selection of projects which will pro- 
vide skill in a desirable variety of tool processes. 
To determine the amount of attention which should be given to 
each process, a definite standard of difficulty should be arrived at 
for each in terms of the amount of repetition which each requires 
Then when the importance of the process is combined with its 
difficulty of learning, an index is obtained which will guide in the 
selection of projects where less than a complete list of home re- 
pairs is selected. For instance, if screwing requires 50 repetitions 
and nailing 75, in order that the standard of efficiency may be 
reached, the selected projects when analyzed must provide this 
amount. If a few projects were selected which, however valuable, 
did not involve either of these processes which stand first in fre- 
quency of use on jobs, the projects would be poorly selected.

Bassett* sought to derive a course of study in civics from a 
study of political platforms. 
Method.—This, according to Bassett, is an appeal to experts 
for a definition of political problems, since the politician is an 
“expert’”’ in politics and particularly in sensing the problems of 
the state. 
Six classes of data were examined. First, an analysis of the 
national platforms of all political parties since 1832; second, an 
analysis of state party platforms in non-Presidential years since 
1889 so far as they deal with national issues; third, an analysis 
of all state platforms of the major parties in the year 1910; fourth, 
an analysis of all the platforms of major parties in California, 
Indiana, and New York since 1850; fifth, an analysis of all plat- 
forms of the parties in Iowa since 1889; and, sixth, an analysis of 
the platforms of one Southern state. : 
Three measures were used: the linear inch; frequency of men- 
tion (the number of platforms in which the topic occurs); the 
number of distinct proposals falling under each topic. A list of 
twenty-six major topics was drawn off by trial and these were 
further subdivided as necessity demanded, 
The usual tabulations occur, showing the linear inches de- 
voted to the twenty-six items by the various parties issuing 
platforms in 1900; the linear inches in the Iowa state platform of 
1914, devoted to the items by the parties issuing platforms; and 
the proposals in state platforms in 1910 by the Republicans and

the Democrats. Tables also are shown showing the summary 
of ranks of each item by years in the national party platforms 
from 1844 to 1916. 
This tabular information was given further treatment by as- 
signing to the lowest item the value of one, to the next highest 
the value two, and so on. On this basis Public Finance made 
the highest score of 440 and Public Office the second with 449 (?). 
Industry with a score of 202, and Health with 32, were the lowest. 
This was checked by giving the highest ranking topic in each 
campaign a value of five, the next four, ete. The relative rankings 
in this case were similar to those described in the preceding para- 
graph. 
A further tabulation was made to show by years the number of 
inches devoted to each topic in the National platforms. 
“1. Certain problems, in their broad outlines, are necessarily 
persistent, since they are inherent in the structure or constituent 
functions of government, e. g., public finance, public office, foreign 
relations, and national defence. 
“2. Certain other problems are persistent from the economic 
organization of society, e. g., corporations (representing the 
capitalist), labor (representing the producer), and natural re- 
sources (representing the third factor of production). 
“3. A third group of problems, which the writer has classified 
under ‘moral reform’, is necessarily persistent so long as there 
are men and women who are forward-looking, and subject to 
humanitarian impulses; and so long as a democratic form of gov- 
ernment renders all social problems potentially political. The 
term ‘moral reform’ has been used in lieu of the more commonly 
employed term ‘social reform,’ for the reason that a moral judg- 
ment rather than an economic or administrative judgment is 
the determining factor in the voter’s decision. 
“4, Certain other problems are relatively persistent as corol- 
lary to our governmental or economic organization and status; 
e.g., immigration (a result of better economic opportunities in 
this country than obtain in other parts of the world), foreign com- 
merce (a result of our power of economic production), state rights
-P-A-G-E-312
ee re he ne me ee

(a result of the historic origin of the Federal government), consti- 
tutions (fuhdamental limitation of governmental action), and 
political parties (arising from the problem of registering the popu- 
lar will). 
“5, The responsibility for the solution of these various prob- 
lems has been distributed among the three most important units — 
of government in this country—viz., national, state, and munici- 
pal (or local) government. For example, foreign relations belong 
exclusively to the Federal government; conduct of elections and 
suffrage qualifications largely to the states; eer is delegated 
largely to the local units. 
“6. There are certain tendencies evident thes a careful study 
of the data: the problems of strict or liberal construction of the 
Constitution, state rights, personal rights, etc., tend to become 
of less importance in political discussion; while labor, corporations, 
and foreign relations tend to become of more importance; still 
other problems like public finance, commerce, and defence, about 
hold their own; health, industry, and justice appear to be gaining 
in importance; all topics of discussion are fundamentally affected 
by the two general trends which the writer believes he discovers 
beneath the surface of our national life — the trend toward more 
efficient nationalism and that toward more complete democracy, 
through the socialization of industry and the democratization of 
parties. 
“7, From all that has gone before, it is safe to assume that 
any course of instruction whose purpose is to prepare for intelligent 
suffrage through the exercise of civic judgments upon concrete 
problems should contain at least the following topics: finance; 
federal, state, municipal, and school district; office, elections, 
civil service, etc., including the related topics of parties and suffrage 
as applied to the locality; corporations; labor, foreign relations, 
including relations to defence and commerce; natural resources, 
conservation, and reclamation; monetary system — money, bank- 
ing, and credit; and the present moral issues of nation, state, 
and community.”

§2—A Socian Srupies CurRicuLUM 
(Study 48) 
H. O. Rugg and Emma Schroeppe in the Lincoln School are 
working upon a social-studies curriculum along lines presented 
in outline in an informal bulletin of information for visitors to 
the school. This report runs as follows: 
“We are attempting to make a course of study which will deal 
with the important phases of the economic, industrial, social, and 
political world to-day, and how it came to be. We believe that in 
each of the twelve grades the children should study the importance 
of modes of living, activities and problems of contemporary life on 
as mature a plane as their mental growth permits. In each grade, 
along with the study of contemporary matters, sufficient historical 
background should be given to make clear the consideration of 
current affairs. 
“We are incorporating in a single continuous course of study 
the essential and socially worth-while materials which have hereto- 
fore appeared in the separate subjects of history, geography, com- 
munity civics, government, and economics. This material is taught 
in a fifty-minute class exercise each day in the fifth and sixth 
grades, and three times a week in the ninth grade. In addition, 
new materials are being incorporated from the study of industry, 
sociology, economics, primitive man, and the like. 
“Tn 1921-22 we are writing and teaching daily the details of 
a new curriculum in the fifth, sixth, and ninth grades. In addition, 
and in order that our materials in these three grades may be 
placed in a total graded scheme, we are tentatively assigning 
materials to the other grades. Eventually, the curriculum research 
in the social studies should include the construction of a continu- 
ous course of study from the lowest grade through the senior high 
school. 
“There are two such tasks. The first is to assemble and select 
such materials as will deal definitely with the social, economic, 
industrial, and political activities in which the masses of the 
people actually engage. The second is to organize this material  
-P-A-G-E-314
    312 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
in such order and form that (to the limit of their mental capacities) 
children shall develop: 
“(1) A scientific attitude toward the economic, social, indus- 
trial, and political problem situations which they meet. 
“(2) Skill in meeting problems of various degrees of complexity. 
“(3) A clear acquaintance with established modes of living. 
“(4) Active recognition of, appreciation of, and interest in, the 
great ‘issues’ of contemporary civilization. 
“We are now carrying along, together, two sets of investiga- 
tions: one that will reveal the present teaching of the social studies, 
and another that will enable us to construct a new course of study. 
The former task consists of the tabulation and the evaluation of 
material which we are collecting from schools throughout the 
country. This includes question blanks on the purpose and scope 
of course, time allotments, the evaluation of printed courses of 
study and of school textbooks, the critical study of existing experi- 
mental curricula, and the like. 
“On the hypothesis that children shall deal only with materials 
that concern actual activities of people (with the crucial historical 
backgrounds), investigations are being made to determine what 
activities, modes of living, and problems are of sufficient importance 
to be incorporated in the course. 
“A tentative statement of some 75 major contemporary prob- 
lems—economic, social, industrial, and political—has been pre- 
pared from the careful analysis of about 140 books of outstanding 
prestige in the different fields. Four steps were taken to select 
this list of problems: 
“1, About 80 leading authorities (economists, students of 
government, business and labor experts, editors, and men of 
academic prestige) gave their judgments as to the very outstand- 
ing books in each field, from which the deepest statement and 
analysis of contemporary problems could be obtained. 
“2. A tabulation was made of the reviews of all books in 
respective fields, published since 1915, which dealt with any of 
these contemporary problems. 
|
-P-A-G-E-315
MISCELLANEOUS STUDIES 313 
“3. The reviews in six weekly journals have been read for 18 
months for the purpose of selecting only those books which, irre- 
spective of faith, were regarded by reviewers as thoroughly funda- 
mental discussions of contemporary matters. 
“4, Each book on the shelves of Columbia University Library 
which dealt with any one of those problems (some 11,000) was 
examined. The title of any one book which was regarded by our 
group as crucial was included in our complete bibliography. This 
bibliography consists now of 1100 titles. 
“From these four steps the list of 140 books has been compiled. 
“We have selected tentatively the fundamental generaliza- 
tions, principles, ‘laws’, which need to be used in order to discuss 
the crucial contemporary problems. These generalizations are 
now being distributed according to the problems to which they 
apply. They are so arranged as to be dealt with through the 
consideration of concrete materials. 
“We are working on the principle that the consideration of 
problems and the utilization of principles and generalizations shall 
grow out of the study of specific incidents in human experience. 
In our course, therefore, hundreds of definite and concrete episodes 
are being incorporated. One principle controlling these episodes 
is that they shall deal with concrete descriptions of events and 
experiences which fit naturally into the lives of the children in 
the respective grades. 
“An elaborate tabulation of allusions in magazines and news- 
papers is being made by Dr. Carleton Washburne, Superintendent 
of Schools in Winnetka, Illinois. Our episodes will be checked 
against the conclusions of this investigation to make sure that the 
minimum essential reading vocabulary of historical and geographi- 
cal reference is incorporated in the course. In addition, we our- 
selves are making a tabulation of the current activities which are 
set forth in condensed form each week in some six weekly 
journals — The Outlook, The Independent, The Literary Digest, 
The Nation, The New Republic, and The Survey.”

§3—An Exrenstve VocaBuLary Strupy* 
(Study 49) 
Thorndike has prepared ‘‘The Teacher’s Word Book” ** 
of 10,000 words according to methods described in Teachers’ 
College Record, September 21, 1921, pages 334-370. This material 
was obtained from counts of over four and one-half million words, 
from forty-one different sources. In material read by children, 
counts were made in part or in whole from such books as “Black 
Beauty,” “Little Women,” “Treasure Island,” and “The Legend 
of Sleepy Hollow,” from ten primers, twenty readers, and text- 
books in arithmetic, geography, history, and Spanish. In standard 
literature, counts were made in concordances of the Bible, Shake- 
speare, Wordsworth, Tennyson, and several other poets. Counts 
were made of books dealing with common facts and trades, such 
as books on carpentry, The Garden and Farm Almanac, and the 
Army Trade Tests; two newspaper counts were made. The 
correspondence studies of Anderson and of Cook and O’Shea were 
also used. A value was given to each word according to the 
number of times it appeared in each unit. For instance, in the 
reading of “Black Beauty,” chapters 10-19, all those words which 
showed a frequency of 1-4 were given “source value” of one. 
Those occurring from 5-9 times were given a value of two. Those 
occurring 10-19 times were given a value of three; those from 
20-29, a value of four; and to those occurring over 29 times a 
value of five was attached. 
In tabulating the words, plurals in s were not counted sep- 
arately. Usually words in which y was changed to ies were not 
*Two other studies, by Knowles and Eldridge, which are frequently 
referred to in spelling literature, are not included here. Eldridge attempted to 
determine a common vocabularly for an international speech by a count of 
the words in the Sunday supplements of Buffalo papers. The Knowles study,

counted separately, nor were adverbs formed by ly, comparatives 
by er or r, superlatives by est and st, or verb forms ending in s, ed 
or d, n or ing, ‘in cases where the derived form would probably 
be easily read and understood by the pupil when he experienced 
it, if he knew the primary word.” Adjectives formed from proper 
nouns by the addition of n were usually not counted. Every 
word and abbreviation in the investigator’s own lists was counted. 
Of these there were some 20,000, with a credit of one or more. 
Rare names were omitted. 
A credit sum for all words was obtained by adding all the cred- 
its. For instance, the word and received a credit of five from the 
Bible, four from Wordsworth, four from Cowper, etc., with a 
credit sum of 210, while the word angel receiving five from the 
Bible, three from Wordsworth. and two from Cowper, etc., had a 
total of 40. 
The word receiving the. highest vaiue, that of 211, was in. 
Words with a value of 200 or over were such as for, zt, on, etc. 
Words with credit sums of 180-199 were such as one, an, no, or, 
some, etc. The investigator presents calculations to show the 
theoretical placing of the words in an infinite count and demon- 
strates the close approximation of his count to a true list. 
The “Teacher’s Word Book” contains about 10,000 words al- 
phabetically listed, with key, showing the credit sum of each word 
and its position in the list. For instance, the word a is followed 
by the symbols 208 and lal. 208 indicates the credit sum and 
lal means that it is in the first thousand, the first one-half, and 
the first hundred. The symbols 23 and 3a which follow the word 
adopt indicate that it has a credit sum of 28, and that it belongs 
to the first one-half of the third thousand. 
The following are the practical uses to which, in the opinion 
of the author, the book can be put. It helps the teacher to decide 
quickly the proper treatment of a word by telling her just how 
important it is. It provides the less experienced teacher with 
that knowledge, both of the importance of words and their diffi- 
culty, which the expert teacher has acquired by years of experi- 
ence with pupils and with books. It also provides a convenient

place to record any useful facts about these words by which 
teaching can be guided and improved.

Uhl* investigated the selection and grade classification of 
reading material according to the interests of children, as reported 
by teachers and pupils. This very thorough study consists of 
several steps, described as follows by the author.

After the returns from the first questionnaire had been tabu- 
lated, it was found that many standard selections had been named 
by large numbers of teachers. The questions were so worded, 
however, that selections with outstanding good or bad qualities 
were most likely to be mentioned. Also, the mentioning of a 
selection depended upon its occurrence in a reader. Conse- 
quently, many standard selections were mentioned only a few 
times. In order to obtain more judgments on these standard 
selections, and to obtain the judgments of many teachers of each 
of the successive grades on the same material, another question- 
naire was prepared. 
The second questionnaire, which was sent in February, 1917, 
was based largely on the results of the first. It consisted of titles 
of selections arranged in lists of about fifty for each of the eight 
grades. In order to obtain a uniform terminology, a descriptive 
list of desirable and undesirable terms used in the responses to 
Questionnaire I was included with the directions for judging the 
selections. 
The choice of selections to be submitted in the second ques+ 
tionnaire was determined on the basis of several considerations 
Although close agreement existed in Questionnaire I upon som 
selections, there was either disagreement or a paucity of ne

    upon other widely used selections. The second questionnaire was 
planned with a view to obtaining (1) confirmatory evidence upon 
certain selections which the earlier questionnaire had indicated as 
either desirable or undesirable — the lists were not so repre- 
sentative of inferior as of superior selections; (2) more ample 
comments upon selections regarding which the responses to 
Questionnaire I were divided; and (3) judgments upon standard 
selections which were seldom or never mentioned in Questionnaire 
I. The descriptive list of qualities together with other directions 
was as follows:

Returns were received from 741 teachers in 49 cities. In order 
to obtain a different kind of data, the selections were presented 
directly to 529 pupils of four different schools. The selections were 
shosen because of their use in nearly every city responding to 
sither questionnaire, the variety of appeals to children as stated 
by teachers, and their common use in more than one grade. To 
provide a uniform appearance they were printed in seventy-page 
booklets. Before the selections were presented to the pupils the 
teachers were personally consulted so that the nature of the 
problem and of the work already done would be understood. The 
lirections given to the teachers are as follows: 
**PLAN FOR THE Stupy or REapiInG SELECTIONS 
“This study of reading selections is being made in order to 
supplement the judgments of a large number of teachers who have 
ulready reported upon them. It is desired, therefore, that the 
real likes and dislikes of pupils be shown in the responses. Before 
peginning their reading, the children should have the general plan 
und purpose told to them in words about as follows: 
““One of the teachers at’ Northwestern University is anxious 
(0 find out just what kind of stories and poems children like. He 
vas already asked many hundreds of teachers about this. The 
eachers made out their lists from the readers which the children 
ised. There may be many others which were not included, but 
hese could not be judged because they were not in the readers 
hich the children used. 
“<This teacher from Northwestern has gathered together the 
elections receiving a large number of votes and had them printed 
n this little volume. 
“You may each have a copy to read over. Perhaps you may 
ecall having read some of them before. If so, reread to refresh 
our memory. Later you may tell on paper which ones you like 
est and why; also which ones you like least and why. Be very
-P-A-G-E-324
  322 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
frank in expressing your opinions, pee you can help most by 
describing fully and truly your likes and dislikes.’ 
“1, Ask pupils to read the selections for their grade without 
aid or discussion. All reading is to be done at school. 
“2. After the reading has been done, ask the pupils to state 
on paper whether they liked or disliked each of the selections 
and why. Ask them to be as definite in replies as possible. The 
pupils should have their books for this work. 
“3. Have a brief class discussion of the selections or parts of 
selections which seem most in need of such discussion. 
“4, Ask the pupils to write responses to the mimeographec 
questions. Ask them to reply as briefly as possible. After the 
pupils finish their replies to each of the selections, ask them tc 
state again whether or not they liked the selection. 
“The pupils should have the books before them for all of the 
exercises. All of the work is to be done in school. If they want 
to use dictionaries of their own accord, allow them to do so. The 
purpose here is merely to find out what the pupils can do with 
these selections. In the class discussions as directed under 3. 
try to avoid influencing the pupils’ judgments.” 
In addition to this, a fourth test was given upon material 
drawn from the set of national selections published by the United 
States Bureau of Education in the Community and National 
Life Series. 
Fifty-nine teachers were asked to state their opinions of them 
according to the following directions: 
“Please indicate in the columns headed ‘Grade Actually Tried’ 
the grade or grades where you personally used the lesson named 
in the preceding column. (For this purpose call the first grade of 
the high school the ninth grade, and so on). 
“Rate the exercise in the column headed ‘Degree of Success’ 
so as to indicate your judgment of how the particular lesson suc- 
ceeded, using letters defined as follows: 
‘A =highly satisfactory and understood by pupils. 
“B =usable but not excellent,

“C =poor. 
“D =complete failure. 
“Tn the column headed ‘Grade Recommended,’ put a figure 
giving your judgment as to the grade for which the lesson is 
appropriate. 
“Tn the column for remarks, indicate a word or two for each 
exercise which you rate A or D the chief characteristics which 
ontributed to the result. Notes on others will also be welcome.”

and show the amount of appeal that each selection makes to chil-

The returns from the other studies are not available at the

The investigator concludes by setting up standards and guid- 
ing principles for the selection of reading material for each grade. 
§5—A CurRRICULUM For CorrecTING PuysicaL Dreructs 
(Study 51) 
Todd* studied the problem of giving attention to physical 
defects in arranging the curriculum in the high school. The 
problem was two-fold: first, to collect correctives for defects and 
second, to arrange a high school program so that attention could 
be given to special cases. 
His first step was to select items for measurement. Thesé¢ 
were those commonly used in physical examinations, as follows 
standing height, sitting height, weight, chest girth, expansion, 
grip of right and grip of left hand, and to the less definite items at 
bad posture, under-developed legs, under-developed arms, ab; 
normal heart, uncleanliness, bad teeth, adenoids, chronic throat 
trouble, deformed feet, and eye strain. 
For the first group it was necessary to procure standards fo} 
each by years. Some of these were found in Porter’s tables and th¢ 
remainder were obtained by Todd by the examination of 250 boy: 
of each age. Standards for the second group are less definite. 
The standards for the first group were prepared, not on th 
basis of averages, but on that of eleven percentiles. That is 
say, chest expansion standards, for instance, showed the expansio! 
of the upper five per cent of those examined, the upper ten pe 
cent, the upper 20 per cent, and so forth. This, obviously, is 
better standard than the average or median because of the fac 
that it provides an incentive for improvement which is not ob 
tained if only the average is given. If a boy of thirteen has

fects”, E. M. Todd, Journal of Educational Research, Vol. III, No. 1.

expansion of 2.8 inches where the median is 2.5 inches, he is up to 
median standard; but if he knows objectively that he is in the 
upper forty per cent and that if by exercise he adds .4 inches 
to his record he becomes a member of the upper 30 per cent, 
or that if he adds a full inch he belongs to the upper five per 
cent, he has an added incentive for improving this very vital 
characteristic. 
The table for expansion (in inches) is as follows: 
Percentile   
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The students are then examined and their cases recorded on a 
Data Card which shows their ranking in the first group in Septem- 
ber, January, and May, and their defects in the second group. 
With these records before the physical instructor he divides 
his boys into three groups: (1) Class A, or normal boys; Class B, 
or those found to be organically and mechanically sound but with 
poor general musculature; and Class C, or those boys in need of 
special corrective attention. 
Class A boys participate in the usual athletic games, Class B 
boys are placed in a special gymnasium class to develop them 
and stimulate interest in physical development. Class C boys can 
be divided into three groups and handled upon that basis. In  
-P-A-G-E-328
  326 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
the first group Todd included those with flat feet, sub-normal 
heart, very poor expansion, and permanent or temporary cripples. 
Not more than ten can be handled in this group at one time and 
only about one in forty in a high school student body will be 
found in it. The second group is composed of those with postural 
faults, those needing especially development of the shoulders, arms, 
and chest. In the third group are placed those needing develop- 
ment of the legs, those with digestive troubles, the extremely fat, 
and the extremely thin. The second and third groups are not 
limited in numbers. 
For each defect the exercises useful for correction are collected 
from the body of exercise material available. 
Todd studied the problem of programming these classes and 
arranged a suggested schedule for the high school which will make 
it possible, on the one hand, to utilize the full time of the physical 
director and, on the other hand, permit the special cases scattered 
throughout the student body to be programmed in classes and 
sections. 
This study is of interest as showing a method of determining 
and displaying standardsfor detecting defects and stimulating — 
the desire for improvement, collecting correctives for defects, — 
grading students on the basis of athletic efficiency, and so pro- 
gramming them as to group together those with like defects. 
§6—INFoRMATION ror BANK DEPosITORS 
(Study 52) 
Miss Camerer* studied the problem of determining what bank 
employees think depositors ought to know about banking. 
Method. — Questionnaires were mailed to fifty bank employees 
and replies were received from thirty-five, representing the States 
of Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, Nebraska, North 
Dakota, Oregon, and Texas. To obtain still further information 
the same questions were submitted to parents of children in the 
elementary school of the University of lowa. The questionnaire, 
*Part I, Seventeenth Yearbook, pp. 18-26, Alice Camerer. 
 
-P-A-G-E-329
MISCELLANEOUS STUDIES 327 
which included fifty items in its list (method of selection not 
stated), was as follows: 
“Questionnaire 
‘What, from your experience, do you think the citizens of your 
community, or of any community, ought to know about the fol- 
lowing items? Please state after each item.” 
A list of banking facts followed, relating to making and endors- 
ing checks, letters of credit, and so on. Directions for checking 
these were as follows: 
“1. If knowledge of the item is very important, put a double 
check (xx) before it. 
“2. If knowledge of the item is less important, yet of some 
value, put a single check (x) before it. 
“3. If knowledge of the item would be of no value, cross it out.” 
Tabulations show the items listed in the order of their impor- 
tance as finally determined by the number of double cross checks 
given them by bankers. (The method of giving two units to 
double crosses and one to single crosses was tried out but did not 
decidedly affect the rankings.) 
The order of the items was as follows for the first five: How 
to write a check; How and why to fill out the stub; When check 
should be cashed; How to stop payment of a check; How to sign 
your name when endorsing a check. The five least important in 
ascending order were: How to secure a letter of credit; How to 
secure traveler’s checks; How to use a letter of credit; How to 
write a produce note; Purpose of days of grace. 
The returns from parents resulted in a ranking which had a 
very low correlation of r =32 by the Spearman Footrule method. 
Proceeding to the formation of a curriculum Miss Camerer 
prepared a composite answer made from ten replies to the ques- 
tion of what knowledge was necessary for the depositor to have. 
The information is presented in the following typical form: 
“1. How to endorse a check in full. 
‘A check is endorsed in full by the payee’s making it payable 
to the order of some bank or individual and then signing his name.’

§7—Srupies in Women’s EpucaTion 
(Study 53) 
The organization of women’s education upon the basis of a 
job analysis is under study for Stephens College by the writer. 
While the investigation has not gone far enough to produce results, 
a description of the methods being used may prove interesting. 
In general the method of attack involves some sort of job 
analysis of women’s activities. This means, essentially, that a list 
of the physical routine activities must be made, and that to these 
must be added, obviously, those mental activities which may be 
included in the term “what she thinks about.” Lists of interests 
and activities of an avocational sort need to be checked. 
While this task seems superficially to be impossible of accom- 
plishment because so complex, it may be affirmed with conviction 
that the broad outlines of women’s activieies can be obtained with 
illuminating details and without undue difficulty. 
The methods used in the study are based fundamentally upon 
the keeping of many hundred diaries with supplementary exhaust- 
ive check-lists of activities and interests. 
On the following pages are given graphs for (1) the fundamen- 
tal investigation, (2) the method of arriving at a vocational 
curriculum, (3) collecting material upon politico-social problems, 
and (4) the derivation. of the fundamental service subjects. 
Chart I, Column 1, shows the methods which are being used in 
the primary analysis. It will be noted that numerous diaries kept 
for a week by college graduates are being analyzed to find what 
college women do and think about after graduation. A number of 
_ more extensive diaries are being kept by a selected group of women, 
and still more intense analyses of physical and mental activities 
are being secured by expert investigators. Accompanying this 
procedure an exhaustive check-list of possible interests of women 
was submitted to a very large number of college graduates, to 
determine the trend of their interest for a number of years after 
graduation. In addition to this, certain vocations for which train- 
ing may be given with the facilities which the college possesses,

will be analyzed and courses of study built up on the basis of the 
analysis. In Column 2 is shown a tentative analysis of the activi- 
ties revealed in Column 1. The ideals which should dominate 
graduates of Stephens College, and upon which major emphasis 
will be placed during the college course, are obtained by expert 
opinion of the college faculty and checked by the opinions of out- 
standing men and women with national perspective. 
When the ideals and activities have been determined a number 
of sub-studies are ready, such as those connected with political 
and social life, the maintenance of health, the decoration of the 
home and person, etc. 
Chart II shows the method by which a course in political and 
social activities is being constructed. Column 1 indicates the 
methods by which the list of fundamental current problems will be 
obtained. These will be evaluated, and in the most important, 
instruction will be given. The ideals which should control in 
carrying on all political activities will be determined by expert 
opinion. When these have been obtained, the possible solutions 
to current problems will be presented. An appeal to historical 
material will be made, and the advantages and disadvantages of 
each solution will be shown, in order that the ideal of open-minded- 
ness may be developed. 
After the subject matter has been collected, the problem of 
the teaching of the material emerges. This is divided into two 
minor problems. Teaching objectives must first be determined 
upon the basis of the ideals and subject matter. The technique 
of teaching, by which instruction can most efficiently be given, will 
be investigated. Then when the task has been completed in the 
college, it is the intention of the administration to have all findings 
of more than local interest published as a service to the teaching 
profession. 
Chart III shows the method by which a vocational course will 
be determined. This follows Chart II so closely that no additional 
explanation is necessary. 
The fourth type of study will be made in connection with 
the fundamental subjects, which are to be derived from the prim-
-P-A-G-E-336
334 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
ary activities. It will be noted that no attention will be paid to 
elective subjects. Only the service phases of the fundamental 
subjects will be considered and these will be derived from the ma- 
terial found in Column ITI in all the studies of which Charts IL 
and III are examples. When this material has been arranged 
in instructional order, it will be taught and later published. 
It should be noted particularly that the courses in the service 
subjects are determined only after the primary subjects have been 
derived from the analysis; they cannot be determined beforehand. 
Only after the courses in foods and hygiene have been set up is it 
possible to discover what chemistry, for instance, is needed to 
master them. This is also true of such subjects as biology, physics, 
or mathematics. Each subject, after it has been set up, can be 
made to reveal the content of its service subjects. When the 
material of the service subject as derived in small portions from all 
superior subjects, is gathered together, the composite can be or- 
ganized, and this with its connective tissue will constitute the total 
content of each service subject. Whether the program of studies 
will include all of a service subject in one course, as a course in 
service mathematics, or in a group of courses, such as service 
mathematics for chemistry or service mathematics for textiles, 
etc., is a matter of pedagogical administration. As a practical 
probability, the single general course is more likely to prevail 
under ordinary circumstances. 
§8—Cotiectine Unrecorpep Mrrnops In Various

(Studies 54 and 55) 
By interviews. — The writer has experimented with methods 
of collecting information to solve problems of teaching, of retail 
salesmanship, and of administration of departments in depart- 
ment stores. 
In the first of these* a group of inexperienced instructors in 
college made a simple job analysis of their duties as instructors 
*“Tmproving College Teaching,” School and Society, April 23, 1921. 
 
-P-A-G-E-337
MISCELLANEOUS STUDIES 335 
and checked their difficulties. This resulted in the listing of 
fourteen problems as follows: (1) Learning to know students, (2) 
Apportioning material to time, (3) Preparation of lessons, (4) 
Handling discussion, (5) Getting students to think, (6) Securing 
interest, (7) Testing (daily and session), (8) Grading papers, (9) 
Grading students, (10) Getting students to work consistently, 
(11) Making assignments, (12) Training students to use what they 
know, (13) Training students to memorize and form habits, and 
(14) Kinds of examinations. 
The topics of the curriculum in methods of teaching thus 
obtained do not include all difficulties; but all topics were diffi- 
culties for the seminar group and were sufficient in number to 
occupy the full time of instruction. 
To obtain the subject matter of the course, the method used 
was that of interviewing expert teachers. The members of the 
seminar were trained to interview by having each interview a 
different successful teacher and write up the answers to the four- 
teen points and then have this material criticized. 
The methods of training are so important that they may he 
described in detail. At the first meeting of the group after the 
interviews had been written, the answers to each question were 
read in class. It was found that the interviewer can improve his 
report by a few devices. He should continually ask “How?” 
to make sure that he is obtaining all the methods used by the 
teacher; for the tendency is to forget that the methods are import- 
ant and to accept generalities. Illustrations should be asked for; 
when the teacher makes a statement, the interviewer may often 
say “For instance — ” or “Give me an illustration”? with good 
results. Our interviewers found difficulty in realizing that they. 
must write everything that they would say in reporting. For 
instance, we had to check the tendency of the interviewer to read 
a sentence from his report and then supplement it orally. This 
was done by asking him when he looked up from his paper and 
talked, ‘Is that down in your report?” Jocular insistence upon 
sticking to the written text produced good results. Occasionally 
it is found that supplementary questions have to be framed to 
 
-P-A-G-E-338
  336 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
get information because the original question does not open a 
lead. Care has to be observed by the interviewer not to rest 
content with the answer “I don’t know how I do it.””. The teacher 
should be encouraged to talk, for, as his mind plays upon the 
topic, he begins to reveal his methods so that the interviewer is 
able to obtain significant fragments and jot them down. The 
interviewer must, also, write very rapidly, as the teacher talks, 
to get all that he can whether strictly on the point or not, and 
then select what he wants during the write-up. Considerable 
ability is rapidly developed by the interviewers in keeping the 
teacher on the point and in keeping him from talking too much; 
but this is a difficult task for a young instructor when interview- 
ing an august and dignified senior colleague. Finally, the inter- 
viewer must preserve the exact language of the teacher so that 
vivid and effective expressions can be preserved. 
When these criticisms had been made the interviewers visited 
other teachers until the results from about forty selected teachers 
had been obtained. 
For mechanical ease each topic was answered on a separate 
half-sheet so that the forty answers to the first topic could be seg- 
regated. These answers were then read by an editor, who sum- 
marized the material with the purpose in mind of preserving all 
suggestions. Care was taken to avoid the editor’s own more or 
less stereotyped expressions and to keep the language of the 
reports, which presumably were in the language of the persons 
interviewed. 
The summarized material was then interpreted in terms of 
the underlying principles of teaching and of psychology. But it 
was found that some of the methods described were based on prin- 
ciples not to be found in textbooks, and consequently new prin- 
ciples had to be formulated to cover them. 
The same plan was followed in handling the problems of retail 
selling. In this case the difficulties were obtained from three or 
four sources. Salespeople were asked to state their difficulties, 
but this yielded disappointing results because salespeople are not 
highly analytical. Executives were asked to list the difficulties
-P-A-G-E-339
MISCELLANEOUS STUDIES 337 
of salespeople, but for the same reason little came of the effort. 
The best results were obtained by sending one of the faculty into 
the store to sell and watch the sales and note difficulties. This 
was checked by having her read a number of books on salesman- 
ship. 
After the difficulties had been listed, interviewers were trained, 
and the material was treated as in the teaching methods already 
discussed. 
It will be of interest to learn that about seven to ten topics are 
enough for one interview on selling, and that thirty is the most 
satisfactory number to interview on any one topic, since we get 
no more suggestions from sixty than from thirty, above which 
number repetition begins to appear. In this way a great mass of 
information was obtained from 300 expert salespeople. The 
answers to about sixty questions from 300 salespeople, when di- 
gested and summarized, provided about one hundred thousand 
words of written material on selling methods. 
In securing the difficulties of heads of departments three 
sources were canvassed. The salespeople were asked to state 
“the difference between a good head of a department and a poor 
one.’”’ Heads of departments were asked the same questions, 
and executives above the heads were invited to give their opinions. 
The collection of difficulties obtained from all these sources was 
thrown into a series of twenty-three questions, and one hundred 
of the best handlers of people in the stores of several cities were 
interviewed, after which the material was digested and sum- 
marized. 
It must be recognized that the subject matter so collected is 
uneven in quality. We may feel quite sure that some of the 
methods described are better than others, although we have no 
means of objective measurement. The same plan of collecting 
information about agriculture or medicine would bring to light 
the common practices of expert farmers and doctors, yet it might 
well happen that a single farmer or doctor would have a better 
method than most experts as measured in crops or cures. Obvi- 
ously, then, the material so collected is worth while only because
-P-A-G-E-340
  338 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
it is better than a statement of principles without illustration. And 
such a body of material affords the basis for the scientific evalua- 
tion of the methods used by experts. 
Furthermore, such a body of methods is more useful in teach- 
ing, in selling, and in other inexact arts than are the mere state- 
ments of principles whose application is left to individuals. It is 
better for salespeople to know the eleven methods of keeping the 
temper with disagreeable customers than to be told merely that 
one way of becoming efficient is to learn to keep one’s temper. 
By a central agency. — The following method for the collection 
of curriculum material is presented by the ‘Committee of Social 
Studies in the High School”’ of the National Association of Secon- 
dary School Principals (Study 55). 
~ “A further broad matter which we wish to present with 
emphasis is the necessity of codperation in the organization of the 
material for instruction in the social sciences. The field is broad 
and we shall develop very slowly if we depend on the purely 
personal initiative of authors and publishers to try out various 
lines of possible work. There must be codperation in creation. 
When a teacher finds some topic which works well he must make 
his experience available for use by all. When there are criticisms 
of existing material which will serve to guide revision, these 
criticisms must be formulated in such a way as to advance the 
course in other centers. 
“The suggestion just made is not an easy one to carry into 
practical operation. American teachers and principals are not in 
the habit of working on the course of study in a creative way. 
There are no agencies which are able easily to collect experience 
and make it available to many. Committees can indeed be 
appointed and can be told to find out something, but committees 
are like the rest of the world — slow to create. 
“We believe that American schools are in need of any agency 
which will seriously attack the problem of coéperative making of 
materials of instruction. The members of this association are 
able, if convinced, to do more than almost any other group in the 
American school system toward such an organization. Our recom- 
 
-P-A-G-E-341
MISCELLANEOUS STUDIES 339 
mendation is that a group of principals of high schools who will 
volunteer for this service undertake to do, each at his own school, 
some definite constructive work. This shall be of three types: 
first, the preparation in full detail of five lessons in any aspect 
of social studies which appeals to him; second, a trial of these 
lessons with a view to determining whether they work and in 
what grade they work best; and third, the exchange of such 
prepared and tested material with other members of the group. 
This third obligation involves the duplication in some form of the 
five lessons to be exchanged and the assumption of the small 
expenses for postage and correspondence necessary in effecting 
the exchange. 
“The business of the Central Committee of this Association 
would then become merely the business of preparing and circula- 
ting lists of volunteers, of receiving one copy of each lesson pre- 
pared for exchange, and of serving as a central repository for the 
experience accumulated during the experiment. It should be 
noted that the Central Committee would not be responsible under 
this arrangement for the creation or even the criticism of the 
material. 
“The Central Committee could serve another useful purpose 
if such a group of volunteers really began work. It could be a 
center to which reports might come of progress made in the 
direction of really introducing this kind of work into schools.” 
§9—Jos ANALYsIS oF TEACHING 
(Study 56) 
A. J. Jones, as Chairman of a committee of the Society of 
College Teachers of Education,* reports upon a job analysis of the 
duties of teachers. 
The method used by the Committee in arriving at the duties 
of teachers is as follows: 
“Hach one of a group of graduate students, all actively engaged 
*Educational Monographs, Society of College Teachers of Education, 
No, 10.
-P-A-G-E-342
340 CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
in teaching, made out a list of the things he actually did in connec- 
tion with his teaching job. This covered a period of several days 
and ranged from giving advice to pupils regarding choice of occu- 
pations, through conduct of the recitation to answering the tele- 
phone and inspecting toilets. These were listed with no attempt 
at organization and with no presuppositions.about whether any 
training would be necessary to prepare for these activities, or, if 
| training were necessary, what it should be. These were then 
| placed in the hands of one member for combination and organiza- 
tion in order to facilitate the study. The next step was a careful — 
and detailed study and discussion by the group, and the addition 
of activities overlooked and of those which came at frequent in- 
tervals. This list was reorganized, printed, and distributed as a 
questionnaire to teachers in various parts of the country in order 
to correct, supplement, or verify it and to find to what extent the 
activities listed were common in the life of the teacher.” 
A list of 139 duties was obtained by this means, and the returns 
from the questionnaire are now in process of being compiled to 
show the amount of participation, the frequency, the presence or 
absence of professional preparation, and the presence or absence 
of assistance from superiors. These are obtained by the following 
directions: 
“Tn Column 1, marked PARTICIPATION 
“Place a double cross (xx) before each activity in which 
you have actually taken part during the present school year. 
“Place a cross (x) before each activity in which you have 
NOT taken part so far this year, but in which you have taken 
part during the past four or five years in your capacity as a 
teacher. 
“Place a circle (0) before each activity in which you have 
NOT taken part within the past four or five years, or never. 
“Tn Column 2, marked FREQUENCY 
“Write D before each activity which you perform daily or 
nearly so; W for weekly or nearly so; M for monthly or nearly 
so.   
 
-P-A-G-E-343
  
MISCELLANEOUS STUDIES 341 
“Write R before each activity which you perform (or per- 
formed) rarely — not more than three or four times a year. 
“In Column 3, marked PREPARATION 
“Place the letter U before each activity listed for which 
you can definitely demonstrate that you have received assist- 
ance in the course of your professional training in normal school 
or college (UNDERGRADUATE). 
“Place the letter G before each activity for which you can 
definitely demonstrate that you have received any assistance 
in graduate professional courses. 
“Tn Column 4, marked ASSISTANCE 
“Place a check (¥ ) before each activity in which you feel 
that you have received real assistance from superintendent, 
principal, or supervisor since you began to teach. 
“Tn advance of the report of the results of this study we may 
properly consider the steps which must be taken in the preparation 
of curricula, utilizing the facts obtained. 
“1. After the complete list is obtained the first step will be to 
determine the activities for which no formal preparation is neces- 
sary, and to eliminate these from the professional courses. Great 
care must here be taken to find whether teachers, as they are, can 
really perform these activities effectively without help. These 
activities would include those which can safely be left to the 
teacher, where no help is needed, and those in which help can best 
be given by principal or supervisor to teachers after they have 
begun to teach. 
“2. When this step has been taken there will presumably be 
left those activities for which formal preparation is necessary or 
helpful. These must then be subdivided into activities, prepara- 
tion for which should be given to inexperienced undergraduates 
and those which should be given to experienced teachers. The 
latter should probably be again divided into undergraduate and 
graduate groups. 
“3. The usual problem is not the mere separation of activities 
into these subdivisions, but the determination of what part of the
-P-A-G-E-344
    342 _ CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
preparation for deigie activities can best be given to inexperienced 
teachers and what part should be left until after experience has 
been gained. 
“4, The next step is the organization of courses and curricula 
to give the preparation necessary. To do this effectively a further 
refinement of job analysis will be necessary. We must distinguish 
between different teaching jobs; e.g., first grade, second grade, 
fifth grade, high-school English, composition, high-school algebra, 
etc. We must determine the elements common to all or to cer- 
tain groups and the elements peculiar to each. 
“After this has been done we must determine the groupings of 
activities that will be most convenient and effective for teaching 
purposes. These should be organized into courses and curricula 
with three aims in view: (1) To prepare undergraduates to begin 
teaching. (2) To improve the teaching of teachers now in service. 
(3) To broaden and liberalize the work of teachers. These three 
aims are usually confused in the plans for professional curricula, 
and this is largely responsible for the ineffectiveness and pointless- 
ness of our work. We have failed to keep clearly in mind the 
steps necessary in the professional training which are, in a measure, 
comparable to those taken in the preparation of the master work- 
man in industry. These steps are, roughly: (1) Definite prepara- 
tion for doing those specific things that will make up the large 
part of the teacher’s time. These will include facts, habits, and 
skills which are definitely related to specific situations. (2) Such 
training as will enable the teacher to do better the things he is 
doing — to improve his methods and provide the basis for meeting 
new situations successfully. (3) Such training as will give the 
teacher an intelligent understanding of and appreciation for the 
reasons for those activities, for the place of the teacher in the 
school, the place and function of the school in the social order, and 
the meaning and purpose of education in a democracy. While 
these need not be taken absolutely as serial steps in the preparation 
of teachers, yet they do afford a point of view from which such 
steps should be planned. They are arranged in the order of most 
immediate need. The usual method of procedure is to reverse the
-P-A-G-E-345
  MISCELLANEOUS STUDIES 343 
order and either to leave out altogether the preparation for specific 
activities or to reduce greatly the relative amount of time given 
to it. We have signally failed to recognize elements of preparation 
that are appropriate to the apprenticeship stage of teaching, and 
have attempted to prepare master workmen all at once out of those 
who have had little or no experience on the job. 
“Tf the analysis thus far made is correct the best general plan 
for courses and curricula would be as follows: 
“1, Courses for inexperienced undergraduates. 
“These should center very largely around the practical work.* 
Just what these should be must be left for a later study. How 
much background, perspective, or ‘liberalizing’ elements it is wise 
to include must also be left to later investigation. This would 
depend, in part at least, upon the intelligence level of the group of 
undergraduate students preparing to teach. It seems probable 
that we are now presupposing too high a degree of intelligence on 
the part of the average undergraduate and too extensive a back- 
ground to profit by much of this work, especially when it is divorced 
from the practical work above mentioned. 
“2. Courses for experienced teachers. 
“These should take the form of: 
“(1) Practical courses based primarily upon the actual, specific 
needs of the teachers constituting the group. These should be 
organized around their needs and not around the stereotyped 
divisions of the field of education, methods, history of education, 
school administration, etc. They should begin with actual con- 
ditions, point the way to improvements in procedure, and attempt 
to give the fundamental principles underlying the best practices. 
When this can be done it will give the teacher a basis for self- 
improvement and superior adjustment not otherwise possible. 
We must, however, not blind ourselves to the fact that many 
teachers will fail to get the underlying principles, no matter how 
*Practical work is here used to include observation, supervised practice 
teaching, and any other exercise or activity which places the prospective 
teacher in actual touch with teaching situations and conditions.

hard we try. In other words, the ability to grasp these principles 
is one of the marks of the master workman, or at least of the 
journeyman stage. 
“(2) ‘Fundamental’ or liberalizing courses, such as history 
of education, principles of education, educational sociology, etc. 
Indispensable as these courses are to the superior teacher, the 
master workman, their value is certainly much lessened when 
they are made basic for the practical work and given to immature, 
inexperienced undergraduates. They should be recognized as the 
culmination of the professional training of the teacher rather than 
the beginning of such training. It is only thus that they can have 
their full value and that time may be given for the more immedi- 
ately necessary courses needed by the prospective teacher.”

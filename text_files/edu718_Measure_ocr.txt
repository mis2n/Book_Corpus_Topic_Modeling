PREFACE 
THE present volume on educational measurement is dom- 
inated by two main ideas, first, that the work in measurement 
should be handled more and more by the individual class- 
room teacher; and second, that the chief purpose to be served 
by standard tests is the diagnosis of pupil ability and pupil 
difficulties. When standard tests were first devised and dur- 
ing the experimental stage, it was well to leave their adminis- 
tration largely in the hands of experts. But now that the 
value of such tests has been fully demonstrated, it is important 
that all teachers master the technique of scientific testing, 
and that courses in educational measurement be included as 
a necessary training for all teachers. Standard tests are a 
new and valuable educational tool or set of tbols. No teacher 
is fully equipped who has not mastered their use. 
The value of standard tests for diagnostic purposes is now 
generally recognized. Diagnostic tests are replacing others 
not well adapted for such purposes. This means that the 
tests are used to locate pupil weaknesses in order that such 
weaknesses may be corrected. The individual child thus 
becomes the center and object of the work. It is not school 
systems as such but children that are important. That we 
have so quickly, in the use of standard tests, come to recognize 
that the child is the true center and the true object of consid- 
eration, is an indication that to-day as never before the spirit 
of progress and service is dominating and determining all 
educational effort. 
The purpose of this volume is not a critical evaluation of 
all the available tests on different subjects, but a treatment 
of those tests which on account of their use, purpose and adapt-

ability have been found to be most serviceable to the class- 
room teacher. To this end classroom results from the use 
of certain tests and the teachers’ reactions to them expressed 
in their own words have been freely used. The work will 
serve as a handbook for the classroom teacher and also as a 
text for use in teacher training classes in high schools, normal 
schools, and colleges, or as a basis for reading circle work. 
The authors have drawn freely from the many available 
sources and they acknowledge the many courtesies, little and 
great, extended by authors of standard tests and by codperat- 
ing teachers and superintendents. 
While the present work is issued as a completed volume, 
it is expected that revisions will be necessary, since standard 
tests have undoubtedly not reached their final development. 
It will be the purpose of the authors to keep the work up to 
date by as frequent revisions as may be necessary in order to 
provide teachers with the latest and best essential data on 
educational measurements.

  HOW TO MEASURE 
CHAPTER I 
THE NEW ATTITUDE TOWARD MEASUREMENT 
WHEN Dr. J. M. Rice, a little more than twenty years ago, 
published his studies applying scientific measurement to the 
results of teaching, there was a storm of protest by educators 
from one end of the country to the other. It was apparent 
that the educational leaders of the country were not ready to 
follow Dr. Rice’s lead. The present movement started with 
studies of a somewhat different nature, such as Thorndike’s 
notable study on ‘‘The Elimination of Children from the 
School’? and studies by Strayer and Elliott upon school 
costs. The application of scientific methods to these phases 
of education was received with more favor by educators, 
and the emphasis was gradually shifted to the measure- 
ment of subject matter through the use of scales and 
standardized tests. Thus, after two decades, Dr. Rice’s 
viewpoint was accepted and his methods improved upon. 
It was fortunate that the first scale for the measurement of 
subject matter was the one in handwriting. The value of 
this scale became apparent immediately, and by degrees 
standards for grade attainment in speed and quality were 
set up. These standards were first developed by practical 
school men through the actual use of the scale.

2 How to Measure 
Even so, when it was proposed at the Philadelphia meeting 
of the department of superintendence in 1913 that a com- 
mittee on school efficiency be appointed, there was vigorous 
opposition. The proposal was merely for the appointment 
of a committee, yet a decision required a standing vote and 
carried by a majority of only one. The next year, at the Rich- 
mond meeting of the department of superintendence, it was. 
surprising to note the change in sentiment. 
The growth that may take place with an individual 
in a single year is well illustrated by the remarks of Super- 
intendent Ben Bluett, of the St. Louis public schools. 
At the Philadelphia meeting, in his usual sincere and 
thorough way of thinking, he was very much disturbed 
that a group of young men should propose the measure- 
ment of “childhood,” “mother love,” and other intangible 
elements of the educative process. There was, in fact, 
never any intention of trying to measure these elements, 
but such terms were used by the opposition, and it was Ben 
Bluett’s impassioned appeal against such procedure which 
had much to do with the large vote against the proposal for 
the appointment of a committee on measurement and school 
efficiency. A year later it was generally agreed that the 
feature of the Richmond meeting was Ben Bluett’s confession. 
He had been made a member of the committee appointed at 
Philadelphia. He had met with this committee, fifteen in 
number, several times during the year, and had studied the 
question earnestly with the other members of the committee. 
He had begun to realize the significance of the movement 
and had secured the codperation of Dr. Withers of the St. 
Louis College for Teachers in applying some of the tests in 
the St. Louis schools. The loyal, sincere, whole-hearted 
manner in which Ben Bluett acknowledged his lack of under- 
standing of the movement a year before, and his thorough 
conversion to the advantages of the movement, swept away 
whatever opposition there may have been in the Richmond
-P-A-G-E-11
The New Attitude toward Measurement 3 
meeting. From that time forward the progress of the move- 
ment has been only a question of ways and means, and 
better adaptation to secure the desired results. Even the 
school survey movement, that phase of the school efficiency 
movement which has been most feared by superintendents 
because of its frequent use by an opposition to discredit 
the work of the schools, has entered upon new life and 
has become an integral part of the American public school 
system. 
It must not be assumed, however, that the work in measure- 
ment in the public schools has been perfected. It has passed 
the first stages. Leaders are convinced. Useful scales and 
tests have been developed. The technique of formulating a 
test has been further perfected and the value of a scientific 
test is better understood. In some respects we have entered 
the second stage of measurement. We have come to the 
point of discriminating between good and bad tests. Already 
a few standardized tests have been discarded. 
We are now quite surely approaching a third stage of 
development, and that is the stage in which the tests shall 
be thoroughly weighed and judged as to the fundamental 
considerations of curricula making involved, whether they 
are or are not testing desirable school products, and whether 
their use will or will not lead to better methods of teaching 
and better selection of subject matter. In this stage the 
standard tests will be used more and more for the diagnosis 
of the weaknesses of individual pupils, more and more in 
testing the efficiency of methods of teaching. It is in this 
third stage that the rank and file of the teaching profession 
are necessarily involved. If the tests are to be of service, 
not merely as a general measure of the efficiency of a school 
system, but also of service to the teacher and for the pupils in 
the schoolroom, then it becomes necessary that the individual 
teacher shall master the details for actually using the tests 
in her own schoolroom. This is not too much to expect if a
-P-A-G-E-12
4 How to Measure 
man well beyond sixty, as was Superintendent Bluett, 
could approach this movement with an open mind and 
accept its benefits after a year of conscientious study. 
That teachers are interested and keen to master the 
accumulated knowledge with regard to measurement is more 
and more apparent. Hence this effort is made to bring to- 
gether the various contributions on the subject in form for 
use by the teacher. It is true, of course, that we shall make 
slow progress in educating the entire teaching profession 
until teachers become a trained body of professional educa- 
tors with permanent tenure. But for this it were unwise 
to wait. In the meantime, may we not expect that any 
one who has accepted the responsibilities of the teaching 
profession will consider that she owes it to herself and to her 
pupils to master the details of using scales and standard- 
ized tests for the measurement of subject matter? 
   
-P-A-G-E-13
CHAPTER IT 
THE MEASUREMENT OF SPELLING 
THERE are at present several spelling tests available. Before 
deciding on which one to select for use, it will be well to 
consider what should be tested in spelling.? 
It appears that a person needs to spell only when he writes. 
People are therefore good spellers, for all social purposes, 
when they spell correctly the words which they use in their 
written work, such as writing letters, articles, club papers, 
compositions, school exercises, business notes, and the like. 
Manifestly the words used under such circumstances are the 
foundation words of the English language. The first require- 
ment of a test in spelling, therefore, is that it be based upon 
the common fundamental words of the English language. 
What to Test. — Much progress has been made in deter- 
mining the fundamental words in the English language. 
Dr. W. Franklin Jones, at the University of South Dakota, 
studied the writifig"vocabulary of grade pupils by analyzing 
the words in the composition work of 1oso0 pupils residing in 
four different states. The work was so managed as to lead 
pupils to cover all the various fields of experience, and so 
exhaust the words in their several vocabularies. The pupils 
continued to write until new words ceased to appear in their 
compositions. In all, 75,000 themes were secured, consisting 
1 The teacher who wants further help on the value of measurement in edu- 
cation should take time to read Chap. XII before proceeding with the present 
chapter. The teacher unfamiliar with statistical terms will need to consult 
Chap. XI as terms occur in this and succeeding chapters. For the practical 
uses of the spelling tests, see the last section of this chapter, beginning on 
page 9.

of a total of 15,000,000 words. Dr. Jones spent eight years 
collecting and scoring these data. When completed, it was 
found that a total of only 4532 different words had been 
used by all these pupils. The largest single vocabulary 
consisted of 2812 words, the vocabulary of an eighth grade 
girl. The result of this study was to give a list of words 
which accurately represents the fundamental words used by 
school children. Apparently, it contains also the funda- 
mental words of the English language. 
Other studies have been made. One of similar character, 
which has led to the formation of a spelling scale, was 
conducted by Dr. Leonard P. Ayres. Dr. Ayres examined 
a total of 368,000 words written by 2500 different persons. 
This was a summary of previous studies. The first of these 
studies included in all about 100,000 words taken from 
standard literary selections. The second was an analysis of 
250 different articles which appeared in four Sunday news- 
papers published in Buffalo. The third consisted of, the 
tabulations of 23,629 words from 2000 short business letters. 
The fourth consisted of some 200,000 words taken from the 
family correspondence of 13 adults. 
The Ayres study has the advantage of being based upon 
the words used by adults, and if we assume that the schools 
must prepare for active social participation on the adult 
level, then certainly Dr. Ayres’ study would be above criticism 
from the standpoint of determining the fundamental words 
of the English language in common use for writing purposes. 
The Jones study and the Ayres study are in complete agree- 
ment as to the simplicity and small compass of the writing 
vocabulary. oe 
Any adequate test must be based upon the words of the 
language that are in common use and fundamental in written 
work. 
The Ayres Scale. —In undertaking to form a scale for 
testing the spelling of school pupils, the first thing which
-P-A-G-E-15
  
The Measurement of Spelling 7 
Dr. Ayres did was to determine the words which were most 
fundamental. The 368,000 words of his study were made up 
largely of repetitions. Fifty different words were repeated 
so frequently that they made up approximately half of the 
entire list. Dr. Ayres had fixed upon 1ooo words as the 
number which he should select. In order to get the 1o0oo 
words, he finally took all words which had been repeated as 
many as 44 times in the entire study. 
The next step was to arrange the different words according 
to difficulty, in order to secure a graded test, or, in other 
words, a spelling scale. To determine the relative difficulty of 
the words in the 1000 list, Dr. Ayres arranged to have the 
words spelled by school pupils. Fifty lists of 20 words each 
were constructed, and the words included in these lists were 
pronounced to the pupils of the various grades in the middle 
of the school year in the schools of 84 cities scattered through- 
out the United States. The data secured from these tests 
gave a total of 1,400,000 spellings by 70,000 school children. 
On the basis of these data, the 1000 words were divided into 
26 groups according to difficulty. This will be understood 
by reference to the scale. (See scale inserted herewith.) 
Group “A” consists of “me” and “do,” and_ these 
words were spelled by 99% of the second grade pupils. At 
the other extreme, Group “Z,” consisting of “ judgment,” 
“yecommend,” and “ allege”? were spelled by only 50% of 
the eighth grade pupils. The scale is simple, and easily 
understood. At the top of each column is shown the average 
per cent of the words spelled by each grade, except that 
report is not made upon any grade for per cents below 50. 
The blank spaces to the left, however, if filled in, would 
indicate in each case 100%, — that is to say, the eighth grade 
pupils spelled all of the words correctly from columns “ A” 
to “N” inclusive. 
Giving a Test.— A good test should be so difficult that 
no pupil in the grade will make a perfect score, and sufficiently  
-P-A-G-E-16
  8 How to Measure 
easy that most pupils in the grade will secure a fairly satis- 
factory score. In selecting words, therefore, to test the 
spelling ability of a particular grade, it would be well to 
choose the words spelled correctly by about 70% of the 
children of that grade. If pupils in the third grade were 
being tested, the best test would result from the use of words 
selected from column “L.” A test, in order to be valid for 
individual pupils as well as for the group, should consist of 
at least 20 words. A smaller number of words would be 
equally valid for an entire school system, but the teacher 
will desire to know the standing of individual pupils, and so 
will need to use 20 words for the test. If 40 words were used, 
the results would be more reliable for individuals. 
The tabulations of the scale are based upon tests given by 
the column method. This is the usual method of dictating 
words for pupils to spell by writing in columns. The Cleveland 
Survey shows that the returns from testing by this method 
differ very little from returns secured when the words are 
used in context. Other studies show that the contextual 
method (including words in complete sentences, the entire 
sentence being written) gives a slightly lower score. It is 
recommended, therefore, that teachers test by the column 
method. All that is necessary is that the pupils be given 
sufficient time to write a word before proceeding to the next 
word. The teacher should also be accommodating in re- 
pronouncing a word when necessary, in order to have it 
understood. Pronounce the words clearly, but do not sound 
them phonetically, or inflect them so as to aid the pupils in 
spelling. Give the meaning of words that sound like words 
with a different meaning and spelling. In case of difficulty 
in understanding a word, the best way to explain it is to use 
it in a simple sentence. 
Scoring the Papers. — If there were 30 pupils in the third 
grade class above referred to, that would give a total of 600 
spellings. Suppose that of these 600 spellings, 480 were   
      
 
-P-A-G-E-17
  The Measurement of Spelling 9 
correct. Then 80% of the words were correctly spelled. 
Referring now to column “ L ” of the scale, it will be observed 
that the class, as a whole, is 7% above the standard of third 
grade pupils in the 84 cities which formed the basis for the 
scale. They are at the same time 8% below the standard 
for fourth grade pupils. Suppose that a particular child in 
the grade has spelled 17 words out of the 20, — that would 
mean a grade of 85%. This is better than the class average 
and only a little below the standard for the fourth grade. 
In the same way, the standing of each pupil in the grade may 
be determined. 
In order to see at a glance the condition of her class, the 
teacher will find it worth while to arrange the scores for her 
grades in a distribution somewhat as follows:

This table means that one pupil made a score of 55, one 
a score of 60,’ two a score of 65, four a score of 70, etc. 
This distribution emphasizes the needs of particular pupils. 
If the teacher of this particular third grade class can, by special 
work with the one pupil at 55, the one at 60, the two at 65, 
and the four at 70, bring these pupils up to the grade’s stand- 
ard, she will have a very satisfactory situation. 
One of the advantages of the Ayres spelling scale is its 
simplicity and the ease with which it can be used. Because 
it contains the fundamental words of the language and the 
words on which the pupil should place his attention, the 
changes which it effects in the character of the spelling work 
‘
-P-A-G-E-18
  Io How to Measure 
will be entirely in the right direction. To the extent that it 
does thus direct the attention to the proper kinds of words, 
we may expect that scores in particular cities will rapidly 
become higher than those indicated on the Ayres scale. 
This fact is indicated by the returns from the use of the 
Ayres scale in Boston, after considerable attention had been 
given by the teachers to the proper selection of word lists. 
Dr. Ayres himself has recognized this possible limitation, 
closing the discussion of his spelling scale with the following 
words: 
“Tn all such testing, it must be remembered that the present 
scale or any scale for measuring spelling attainment will become 
increasingly and rapidly less reliable for measuring purposes as the 
children become more accustomed to spelling these particular 
words. In proportion as these lists are used for the purposes of 
classroom drill, the scale will become untrustworthy as a measur- 
ing instrument. Probably the scale will have served its greatest 
usefulness in any locality when the school children have mastered 
these 1000 words so thoroughly that the scale has become quite 
useless as a measuring instrument.” 
Other Tests. — While it is recommended that the grade 
teacher use only the Ayres scale in testing her pupils as in- 
dividuals and her room for comparison with other rooms 
within the city or elsewhere, many teachers, and especially 
superintendents, will desire at least some information con- 
cerning other lists which have been used as spelling tests. 
The most notable of these are the Buckingham extension of 
the Ayres scale, the Iowa Spelling scale, the Buckingham 
scale, the Rice test, the Starch test, the Courtis Spelling 
test, the Boston Minimum list, and Jones’ One Hundred 
Demons. : 
Buckingham’s Extension of the Ayres Scale. — Dr. Bucking- 
ham’s extension of the Ayres scale (first available in 1919) 
consists of the addition of 505 words chosen on the basis of 
agreements among spelling books. The words are added, for
-P-A-G-E-19
  The Measurement of Spelling Il 
the most part, to the upper end of the Ayres scale. This 
increases the number of words in the columns at the upper 
end of the scale and also extends the scale six steps to the 
right. The added words are not offered as constituting a 
fundamental vocabulary in the same sense as were the 
original tooo words selected by Ayres. In using this ex- 
tension, therefore, teachers should keep in mind that the 
added words have less value from the standpoint of social 
utility than the rooo original words of the scale. The addition 
of these words, however, makes it possible to use the scale 
more extensively in upper grades and high school. It should 
be of particular value in testing the spelling efficiency of the 
pupils in the high school who are specializing in commercial 
studies. 
The Iowa Spelling Scale. — This scale includes 2977 words 
from the written correspondence of Iowa people. Accuracy 
of each word was determined on the basis of 200 or more 
spellings by children in each grade. Thus, more than 650,000 
spellings were used in each grade, or a total of nearly 4,750,000 
in the seven grades. In all essential features the scale is an 
imitation of the Ayres scale. The placing of the words is 
determined in practically the same manner and the form of 
the scale is similar. It has decided value, however, as 
showing the possibility of basing the spelling work directly 
upon the words of a particular section of the country. The 
scale is published in three parts in order to reduce the error 
in the placement of words. Part 1 is a scale for grades 2, 3, 
and 4; part 2, a scale for grades 4, 5, and 6; and part 3, a 
scale for grades 6, 7, and8. The large increase in the number 
of words makes the scale particularly valuable for individual 
testing. 
The Buckingham Scale. — The work of Dr. Buckingham in 
evaluating a list of 50 words, has to date proved of value 
chiefly ‘in calling attention to the importance of the proper 
selection of word lists, the difference in the difficulty of words,
-P-A-G-E-20
  I2 How to Measure 
and the methods to be used in the further study of words for 
spelling lists. The scale first appeared in 1913, and apparently 
has not come into general use in school testing and school 
survey work. The Ayres scale, which made its appearance 
a little later, is so convenient and so satisfactory that it has 
been extensively used by superintendents, bureaus of efficiency, 
and survey committees. 
The fifty words resulting from the Buckingham study are 
given herewith, in the order of their difficulty. These words 
vary in difficulty by even distances, so that the scale, as it 
appears, is a step scale. Theoretically it should be used in 
such a way as to determine how far up the scale a pupil can 
spell successfully. It can be used in grades three to eight. 
Dr. Buckingham, in deriving the scale, pronounced all of, 
the words to the children in contextual form. In view of other 
studies which have been made, it appears that they could be 
used in column form with results slightly varying and equally 
satisfactory for comparative purposes. Although not in 
general use, the scale is mentioned because of the high quality 
of the scientific work involved in its formation. It has not 
been evaluated in terms of grade achievement. However, 
Dr. Buckingham is working on an extension of his scale. 
In time, he expects to extend it to include 1000 words and 
evaluate it in terms of grade achievement.

The Rice Test.—It was Dr. J. M. Rice, in his Forum 
articles of 1897, who first began the work of attempting a 
definite measurement of spelling. He gave three different 
tests, the number of children examined reaching nearly 
-33,000. ‘The first test consisted of 50 words pronounced by 
the teachers for written spelling in the usual manner. The 
words used in this test were the following : 
furniture beggar breakfast Missouri 
chandelier plumber chocolate Alleghenies 
curtain superintendent cabbage independent 
bureau engine dough confectionery 
bedstead conductor biscuit different 
ceiling brakeman celery *‘ addition 
cellar baggage - vegetable division 
entrance machinery scholar arithmetic 
building Tuesday geography decimal 
tailor Wednesday strait lead 
doctor Saturday Chicago steel 
physician February Mississippi pigeon 
musician autumn 
Dr. Rice had some question as to the value of word lists 
for spelling work, recognizing that spelling was useful only 
as a means for recording or communicating thoughts. This 
is the same point which we now recognize in different form ; 
viz. that only the written vocabulary needs to be mastered 
for spelling purposes. 
 
-P-A-G-E-22
  14 How to Measure 
In line with this thought, Dr. Rice gave a second test to 
more than 13,000 children. This test contained 50 words 
placed in composition form. The following sentences were 
used, the underscored words forming the basis of the test : 
“While running he slipped. I listened to his queer speech, but

composition test based upon a picture and a story told by 
the teacher. This test was valuable particularly in that it 
required pupils to choose their own words and to spell them. 
The results on the third test are not tabulated by Dr. Rice, 
but we do have some tabulations on the first and second 
tests and the averages are given herewith.

Since Dr. Rice gave these tests to a sufficiently large number 
of pupils, the teacher may accept the averages given above 
as norms or standards of performance, and by comparison 
with them may determine the spelling ability of her own pupils. 
The chief objection to the Rice list is that the words are 
not evaluated, and do not form a scientifically constructed 
scale. The words are given uniform values, but are far from 
being uniform in difficulty. In the Ayres and Buckingham 
scales, the words are assigned values according to difficulty. 
In the Rice test, a pupil gets as much credit for spelling an 
easy word as he does for spelling a difficult word. 
The Starch Test. — Any one making use of the Starch test 
in spelling will do it with quite different purposes in mind 
than those for which he uses the Ayres scale. The words were 
secured by taking the first defined word on the even-numbered 
pages of the 1910 edition of the New International Dictionary. 
Proper names, technical words, and obsolete words were dis- 
carded from the list. The list, thus reduced to 600 words,
-P-A-G-E-24
    16 How to Measure 
was arranged alphabetically according to the size of the words. 
These were then divided into six lists of 100 words each by 
assigning words in turn to the six lists. A test is made by 
using one of these six lists, which are assumed to be of equal 
difficulty as lists. 
By using words selected at random from the entire English 
language, Starch proposes to test general spelling ability, 
and his tests will be found to be of service in the grammar 
and high school grades, provided the test is not permitted in 
turn to exercise an influence upon the teacher in determining 
the materials of the spelling lessons. The influence of the 
Starch test is surely in the direction of the old “ spelling grind ” 
described by Rice. The Starch lists contain such words as 
the following : 
nunciature conterminous anthropometric 
quarantinable photosphere imperturbation 
Such words are manifestly not suitable for use with grade 
pupils. 
The Boston Minimum List. — The Boston School Document 
No. 8, 1914, contains a minimum spelling list of 840 words. 
They are well selected, and similar in many respects to the 
Ayres list. However, they have not been evaluated for use 
as a standard test. The document containing this list, and a 
supplementary list of 2525 words, is no longer available 
except in libraries of departments of education. It is of 
interest chiefly in showing the tendency to get away from 
the old type of speller which contained 10,000 to 15,000 
words, selected with little regard for use. The California 
list! is similar to the Boston list and is constructed. along 
similar lines. It is of value for curriculum making in spelling, 
but not for testing. 
Jones’ One Hundred Demons. — Dr. Jones has given a list 
of the 100 words most often misspelled by pupils in written 
1 Bulletin No. 7, Chico State Normal, Chico, California. 
 
-P-A-G-E-25
The Measurement of Spelling a7 
work, as shown by his study involving the tabulation of 
15,000,000 words. ‘This list he has designated as the “‘ spelling 
demons.” The list has been widely used for testing, but to 
date it has not been sufficiently evaluated in terms of grade 
standards, although Dr. Jones promises such evaluation in 
the near future. The list appeals to children because of its 
simplicity, and its known difficulty. If a pupil thoroughly 
masters this list of “‘ demons” he will very probably correct 
the spelling of most of the words which he has been mis- 
spelling. Dr. Jones did not find any pupil among the 1050 
who missed as many as 100 words, 87 being the largest list 
for any one pupil. 
The list of “ spelling demons,” together with their relative 
difficulty as shown by preliminary tests which Dr. Jones has 
summarized, follows herewith:

The Pupil’s Own List of Misspelled Words. — The final 
test of spelling is a gradual decrease in the pupil’s own list of 
misspelled words. A necessary precaution in this connection 
is that pupils should not consciously avoid good words because 
they do not know how to spell them. They should be taught 
to use the dictionary instead of replacing good words by 
simpler words which they are able to spell. If every child 
is told to keep a list of his own misspelled words and, to 
build up a spelling consciousness with the aid of the dic- 
tionary, and if he is urged constantly to extend his vocabulary 
and to study the choice of words in order to get appropriate 
and accurate expression, a pupil’s spelling in regular written 
work may be considered as the best and the final test of spelling. 
At stated intervals, a pupil should be encouraged to go over 
8 or 10 pages of his written material and determine carefully 
the number of misspelled words. The teacher can help the 
child in doing this. But for the teacher to do it without 
the child’s help has been in general the mistake of the past. 
In proportion as the number of misspelled words decreases, 
the child is improving in spelling. 
While this test is not scientific, we can conceive of teachers 
making it even more valuable than scientific tests as they are 
frequently used. We do know that the time which a pupil 
spends upon his own list of misspelled words involves nov 
lost effort; and that his spelling improves in the same pro- 
portion that this list is reduced. Indiscriminate drill in 
spelling, as indicated in the Butte, Montana, survey, must 
be replaced by attention to the needs of individual pupils. 
There were 278 of the Butte children, or over 18% of the 
total, who made scores of less than 60%, although the total ©
-P-A-G-E-27
  The Measurement of Spelling 19 
score for the city was 10.3% above the Ayres standard. 
Much time had been spent upon indiscriminate drill. 
The Practical Uses of a Spelling Scale. — Teachers will 
find a spelling scale of very great use in their regular school 
work, aside from any supervisory use which the superintendent 
may make of the tests given. Tests administered under uni- 
form conditions and with a scientifically constructed scale per- 
mit the teacher to compare one class with another very accu- 
rately. If the fourth grade teachers in a city system would 
agree among themselves to give a test on a certain day, they 
could then come together after the papers had been scored and 
find out, first of all, which room was doing the best work. 
This would be shown not only by the median score, but also 
by the total distribution which shows the number of pupils 
at lower as well as at higher levels. 
After the teachers have agreed that a certain one of the 
fourth grade rooms has made, all told, the best score in the 
test, a second question naturally arises; namely, what 
method was used in securing these results with your children? 
This question suggests the second use which the teacher may 
make of the scale. She can test out different methods in her 
own room, or the particular group of fourth grade teachers to 
which we have referred may separate their rooms into groups 
of approximately equal ability and assign different methods 
for different groups. Then, at the close of a given period, — 
one, two, three, or six months, — they may again give a test 
and so determine which methods are most effective. If the 
teachers have been wise they have determined in great detail 
how the methods were to be applied and the amount of time 
to be devoted to the spelling work, so that the one thing 
which is upon trial is the method of presenting the work; such, 
for instance, as the column method, the contextual method, 
the method of studying at home or in the seat and then testing 
. in class, the method of teaching in class with very little 
testing, and various other methods.
-P-A-G-E-28
    
20 How to Measure 
The above paragraph suggests a third point which teachers 
may try out by the use of a scientific scale; namely, the 
amount of time which can profitably be devoted to spelling. 
Dr. Rice, in his discussion of the spelling grind in 1897, showed 
that the time element had very little to do with results. We 
now know that this was because of the character of the spelling 
lists. When the words used in the spelling work with children 
are unintelligible to them, the results will be poor, regardless 
of the methods and the time devoted to the work. But if 
we assume words with correct social values, then the Ayres 
scale may properly be used for determining the amount of time 
which can be spent upon the spelling work with greatest profit. 
A fourth use of the spelling scale has been suggested in 
asking the teacher to make a distribution of the grades. This 
use is to locate the spelling ability of individual children. 
By doing this, the teacher will probably find in her classes a 
small number of pupils who spell so well that it is unnecessary 
to require them to submit to any regular spelling drill. If 
such pupils are excused from spelling drill, being told merely 
to attend to their own misspelled words and to use the dic- 
tionary when in doubt, and if the teacher finds in future testing 
that these pupils do not lower their scores, then she may 
feel that she has saved their time for other more valuable 
work without detriment to them, so far as spelling is con- 
cerned. At the other end of the scale, however, will be 
pupils who spell very poorly, and it is only by use of the 
scale that these pupils can be located with any degree of 
accuracy. Taking these pupils as individuals, or as groups 
according to their several needs, the teacher can work in a 
definite manner, giving additional time to some pupils without 
boring others, and really follow out the injunction of William 
Hawley Smith to “ put the oil where the squeak is.” It is 
quite probable that this result of the use of the scale in 
spelling, as in writing, will in time become one of its most 
valuable contributions.
-P-A-G-E-29
  The Measurement of Spelling 21 
Some pupils will make low scores in their spelling work 
because of the lack of general intelligence; others, because of 
the lack of an adequate vocabulary, which can come only 
from reading; others because their attention has never been 
directed to the difficulties of words, etc., etc. The teacher 
will know that she is working at the problem in a definite 
manner, and that she is working only with the pupils who 
need attention. This she has known more or less before in a 
general way, but the use of a scientific scale permits her to 
know it beyond peradventure of a doubt. 
It is not the purpose of the present work to discuss methods 
of spelling. The teacher is directed to other works dealing 
specifically with this problem. The teacher will do well, 
however, to make her spelling work as specific as possible, 
both as to words and pupils. Many words spell themselves 
and require no attention, others are very difficult for large 
numbers of pupils. It is not only necessary to locate the 
words, but to analyze each word to see in what the difficulty 
consists. In short, drill which is general and blind must 
become specific and intelligent. 
The discussion throughout has directed the attention of the 
teacher to the Ayres scale. Some teachers may properly 
ask if other scales may not at times be used to advantage. 
There will be no harm done in using other scales and the 
teacher may learn to use the Buckingham scale very effec- 
tively. The Jones’ ‘‘Demons” have the advantage of being 
the words most frequently missed by school pupils. They are 
common words, and it is safe to assume that every pupil in 
the upper grades should study these words until he can spell 
the entire list without a mistake. In general, however, the 
Ayres scale is the one to use, for reasons which have been 
previously stated. There is this caution only, and that has

  22 How to Measure 
been anticipated by Ayres himself; namely, that as the scale 
is used more and more with the same pupils, a teacher should 
expect that gradually the scores will become higher. This, 
however, is quite satisfactory, since the words are of the right 
kind and since, by using the scale, the pupil’s attention has 
been turned from unfamiliar, useless dictionary words to the 
words which he will use in his own work.

CHAPTER IIT 
THE MEASUREMENT OF HANDWRITING 
Tue writing supervisor had given Wilbur a grade of 95. 
Wilbur was dissatisfied. When the supervisor next came to 
the building, Wilbur made known his dissatisfaction, and 
asked why his grade was not higher. The supervisor answered 
that 95% was a good grade, that she never gave 100%, and 
that there was opportunity for him to further improve his 
work. Wilbur answered that he had received 95% from the 
fourth grade up, and he knew that he was writing much 
better than in any previous grade. The supervisor had no 
conclusive or satisfactory argument. She resorted to her 
authority as teacher, and left Wilbur still dissatisfied. What 
teacher has not had a similar experience with reference to the 
grade in writing? 
This situation is rapidly changing in the public schools. 
Writing can be definitely measured, and the ratings can be 
made so accurately that the pupils themselves fully under- 
stand and appreciate that exact justice has been done. ‘This 
has been brought about by’ the development of scales for the 
measurement of handwriting. 
If a teacher has not been accustomed to make use of 
scales and standardized tests in her work of grading, she 
would do well to begin with the subject of writing. Writing 
is one of the mechanical subjects and one of the most easily 
and quickly measured. In order to avoid confusion on her 
part, she should study and practice scientific measurement in 
this subject alone until she has become reasonably proficient. 
It will be well for the teacher to read through a large num- 
ber of the works mentioned in the bibliography at the close 
23
-P-A-G-E-32
  24 How to Measure 
of this chapter, and as a beginning in this work, particular 
attention is called to numbers 1 and 2. 
The first scale in handwriting was developed by Dr. E. L. 
Thorndike, of Teachers College. It is based upon general 
merit in handwriting as determined by the judgment of a 
large number of competent graders. Thorndike’s scale is 
widely used at the present time, and many think that it 
gives more satisfactory results than any other. It had, 
originally, the disadvantage! of being mechanically in- 
convenient, and for that reason the Ayres scale has become 
much more widely used. 
The Ayres scale consists of twenty-four samples of writing, 
eight each of vertical, semi-slant, and full slant style. The 
scale is arranged on a heavy sheet of paper 9’’ high and 36” 
wide, in the form of the following diagram : 
  
  
  
It is so convenient in form that it may be placed in the 
schoolroom, where pupils may compare their handwriting 
with it at any time. This is desirable, and it is recommended 
that every schoolroom in which there are intermediate and 
upper grade pupils should have a copy of the Ayres scale 
available for pupils as well as for teachers. (See pp. 28-35.) 
What to Measure. — Ordinarily the teacher will measure 
only two elements in handwriting ; namely, speed and quality. 
By speed is meant the number of letters written per minute. 
By quality is meant general merit, or what the teacher indi- 
cates when she gives a grade in writing. Speed is determined 
1 A defect since remedied in large measure.
-P-A-G-E-33
  
The Measurement of H andwriting 25 
by simply counting the number of letters written during a 
given time and reducing to the one-minute basis. It is 
quality or general merit which is measured by the use of the 
writing scale. These terms are relatively simple, and their 
significance will appear during the further discussion. It 
is just as well for the teacher to begin by giving a regular 
test, and in this manner to apply herself to the work of master- 
ing the details of grading and evaluating papers in handwriting. 
Giving the Test. — In order to make the test valid for 
comparative purposes, uniform conditions must prevail. 
The rules of the game are simple, and the teacher should 
follow them carefully, since it is only in this way that valuable 
comparison will be made possible. The directions for tests 
in handwriting are so generally standardized at the present 
time that comparison is possible, not only within the class, 
but one room with another and even one school system with 
another. The invariable aim is to secure results in such form 
as to make them easily comparable with like results obtained 
elsewhere. The rules are as follows: 
1. The copy must be simple enough for seosal grade 
pupils. While it is not necessary to use the same copy each 
time, it should be similar in difficulty. A copy which has 
been much used is the line: ‘ Mary had a little lamb.” 
Others have used the entire first stanza of this selection. 
Another copy which has been used is “‘ Sing a song of sixpence, 
a pocket full of rye.” The idea is to have a simple, easily 
understood copy, which will not deter the pupil in his speed 
test. Some tests have been given with copy which was too 
difficult, making the results in speed unsatisfactory for com- 
parative purposes. 
2. Before the test is given, the copy should be memorized 
by all of the pupils. The purpose of the test is to determine 
speed and quality of handwriting. If the pupil must stop 
and think, he falls behind in speed. In one survey a rather 
difficult copy was placed in the hands of the pupils. They
-P-A-G-E-34
  26 How to Measure 
were instructed to write the copy, repeating the same during 
the period of the test. The results were so unsatisfactory 
that speed was not reported upon by the survey committee. 
In addition to having the copy committed, it is a good plan 
to place the same upon the blackboard at several different 
places, so that any pupil who does happen to forget for a 
moment may reassure himself by a glance at the copy. 
3. The time for the test should be exactly two minutes. 
In order to make sure that all pupils start together, it is well 
to rehearse the details before actually starting the test. This 
makes sure that all pupils understand, clears away any con- 
fusion, and so secures the test papers in reliable form. 
4. Everything should be in readiness for the test before the 
pupils begin. This means that every pupil must have paper, 
a good pen, ink, and the copy committed. In order to make 
sure that all have pens, it is well to ask every pupil in the 
room to hold up the pen (or pencil, if used in second or third 
grade). Since the teacher will want to use the results of the 
test for the benefit of individual pupils, it is well at this point 
to place certain items at the head of the paper. The usual 
items are—name, grade, building, city, and date. If for 
any reason it is desired to make the test impersonal, these 
items may be omitted, or placed on a separate card with a 
number scheme as a key. 
5. When all is ready, the teacher gives some simple direc- 
tions. ‘‘ Write as well as you can at your usual speed, using 
the following copy: ‘ Mary had a little lamb.’ Write the 
copy again and again until I say ‘stop.’ At the command, 
stop at once, even if in the middle of a letter.” After this 
explanation has been given the teacher says, “ All in position. 
Dip the pens. Pens up. Begin.” 
6. In exactly two minutes, pupils should be given the 
order to stop, and required to place their pens on the desk. 
7. At this point the teacher may save herself considerable 
work by having the pupils count the number of letters in the
-P-A-G-E-35
  
The Measurement of Handwriting 27 
copy. It is suggested that pupils place this number below 
the copy to the right, using pencil for the same, and -then 
divide the number by two, thus reducing the score to a one- 
minute basis, as 2)146. The papers may then be collected 
73 
in the usual manner. 
Scoring for Speed. — The speed is calculated in terms of the 
number of letters written per minute. The test is given over 
a two-minute period in order to reduce the error. Some 
examiners have used other units, as three or four minutes, but 
evidence is not at hand that the results have been improved. 
In the first report upon speed in handwriting,’ two minutes 
was made the basis of the test, and this unit has quite generally 
been used in later tests. The practice is common, also, of 
reducing to the one-minute basis, thus making comparison easy. 
The speed measurement is secured by counting the letters 
in the pupil’s copy and dividing by two. Although the 
pupils have been asked to count the number of letters, the 
teacher should carefully check the results. The teacher may 
reduce her work by knowing the total number of letters in the 
copy used, multiplying by the number of repetitions of the 
full copy, then adding the extra letters. Suppose a particular 
pupil has written the copy, “ Mary had a little lamb,” eight 
times, and has written the first three words the ninth time. 
The teacher in figuring the number of letters will multiply 18 
by 8 which gives her 144 and then add the number of letters 
in the three words, — ‘‘ Mary had a,” namely, eight. This 
gives a total of 152 letters, Dividing by 2 she gets the pupil’s 
score, 76 letters per minute. In case the teacher gets a result 
different from the pupil’s result, the same should be placed 
in the lower right-hand corner, the pupil’s figure being crossed 
out. This completes the scoring of the papers for speed.

for speed in handwriting.

  36 - How to Measure 
Scoring for Quality. — The teacher will be surprised how 
quickly she can learn to grade papers by using the Ayres 
scale. While it is helpful to have a demonstration and some 
practice in a teachers’ meeting, this is not at all necessary, 
and the teacher who is patient and willing can train herself 
very quickly to use this scale and to secure satisfactory results. 
‘The teacher should give herself preliminary drill of at least an 
hour or two. If this drill is divided into half hour periods, 
and continued during a considerable part of a week, the 
teacher will become reasonably uniform in grading papers, 
and will feel competent to score the papers from the test in 
her room. At this point it would be well for her to consult an 
expert, in case one is available. This expert by a little observ- 
ing and advising will correct any marked defect, — such as a 
uniform tendency to grade too low or too high. In the absence, 
however, of a teacher, a supervisor, or a superintendent, in the 
system, who can give this expert help, a teacher need not be 
deterred. She can master the details, working entirely alone. 
Directions for grading a sample, while not uniform, have 
in mind the common object of helping the teacher to locate 
the specimen on the scale which most nearly corresponds in 
merit with the pupil’s copy. Apparently the best way to do 
this is to glide the pupil’s copy back and forth underneath the 
scale, comparing it with one sample after another in the scale 
until a decision is reached as to which sample most nearly 
corresponds with the pupil’s copy. The teacher will fre- 
quently have difficulty, and especially where the pupil’s copy 
is better, for example, than 50 on the Ayres scale, but not as 
good as 60. Some scorers recommend the use of intermediate 
units in such cases, permitting the teacher thus to indicate 
54, 56, or whatever the proper value may appear to be. 
Practice on this point varies. If the number of papers to be 
scored is not too large, intermediate values may be used. 
The score for quality when determined upon should be 
placed in the upper right-hand corner of the paper.
-P-A-G-E-45
  The Measurement of Handwriting 37: 
Recording the Scores. — From the beginning the teacher 
should acquire the habit of distributing her scores, showing 
both speed and quality on a single sheet. This will be found 
exceedingly helpful. Table 3, which follows herewith, shows 
such a distribution for a sixth grade. By reference to this, 
it will be seen that of the 33 pupils in the grade, 2 are writing 
at quality 20 (see totals at the bottom of the sheet), 4 at 
quality 30, 5 at quality 40, 8 at quality 50, 8 at quality 60, 
5 at quality 70, and 1 at quality 80. The middle! score 
  
  
    
        
          
  on the basis of quality will fall therefore in the group of 8 at 
50 and this is noted below as the median quality.

The totals for speed are indicated in the right-hand column. 
It is observed that the median speed falls between 51 and 60. 
In this particular case, however, the teacher has determined

33 papers, the middle score in this case will be that of the 17th paper from 
either end.

  38 How to Measure 
the exact median for speed, and it is recorded below as 56. 
To determine the exact median for speed all that is necessary 
is to arrange the papers in order, from lowest to highest on the 
basis of speed, then count in to the middle paper. In this 
particular case the middle paper would be the 17th one from 
either end, and it appears that the 17th one had a speed of 
56 letters per minute. 
Standard Scores.— With the scores fully tabled the 
teacher’s next question naturally is, “ How does the writing 
of my pupils compare with others, and what are the 
standards? ”’ She wonders if sixth grade pupils should show 
a range in quality from 20 to 80, and if a median quality of 50 
is too low. In speed she notes that they are distributed from 
less than 30 to nearly 100. This means that some of the 
pupils are writing three times as rapidly as others. How 
rapidly should they write? So far as known this question 
was first raised only six years ago, and at that time a tentative 
standard for speed was indicated on the basis of results from a 
single city system.

indicate rather definitely how well pupils in any particular 
grade should write. 
Table 4, given herewith, shows the median attainment in 
speed for Cleveland, Kansas City, Denver, South Bend, 
fifty-six cities combined, Brookline, Newton, the Missouri 
Training Schools, and over 33,000 Iowa children. 
From this table it will be seen that sixth grade children 
from different parts of the country are averaging from 63 
up to g2 letters per minute. It should be noted, however, that 
the 82 for South Bend is a May average and was secured by 
special attention after a test given earlier in the year had 
shown the need for improvement. It is apparent, then, 
that the particular sixth grade shown in Table 3 is quite 
definitely below standard, if we take as a standard the per- 
formance of other sixth grade children throughout the country. 
In this connection, it may be well to note two proposed 
standards made by men who have given considerable thought 
and attention to the subject.

Tables 4 and 5 will give plenty of opportunity for com- 
parison with actual performance and with proposed standards, 
to enable the teacher to judge of the writing in her own room. 
It appears that the median speed of 56 for her sixth grade is 
lower than the sixth grade median of any system appearing 
in Table 4, and indicates that the teacher should increase the 
speed of writing in this particular grade. She should at 
least aim to reach 63, the average of Freeman’s 56 cities, the 
average also for Denver and the lowest sixth grade median 
appearing in Tables 4 or 5.

40 How to Measure 
Standards for Quality.— In measuring quality for com- 
parative purposes it is necessary to use one of the standard 
scales of handwriting. Not all studies in the measurement 
of handwriting have made use of the Ayres scale, but Table 
6, given herewith, shows several returns in the Ayres scale 
and will permit comparison.

It will be observed from this table that quality in hand- 
writing for the sixth grade has ranged from 42 in the Missouri 
Training Schools to 59 in the 56 cities reported by Freeman. 
It appears therefore that the particular sixth grade reported 
in Table 3, is writing better than the sixth grade pupils in the 
Missouri Training Schools, Brookline, Cleveland, and Denver, 
but not so well as those in South Bend, Newton, Iowa, or 
Freeman’s 56 cities. 
The standards proposed by Freeman and Starch for quality 
are likewise given herewith:

-P-A-G-E-49
The Measurement of Handwriting 41 
It will be observed that the particular sixth grade writes 
better than the standard indicated by Starch, but not so well 
as the standard indicated by Freeman. 
Social Standard of Writing.— In attempting to set up 
standards, there is one danger which school people are likely 
to encounter, and that is the danger of considering writing as 
a school exercise, wholly apart from the social and business 
demands of life outside the school. In the last analysis it is 
this latter which should determine the proper standards. 
While it is difficult to get at the standards required by society, 
there are at least some evidences of social standards of hand- 
writing. Dr. Ayres has constructed a special handwriting 
scale for the Municipal Civil Service Commission of New 
York City. On the basis of this scale, the Commission con- 
siders that applicants pass in handwriting if they make 
a grade corresponding to quality 4o of the Ayres public school 
scale. Where handwriting is a special requirement a grade 
equal to quality 50 is required. These standards are lower 
than the Freeman standard for the sixth grade, and correspond 
fairly well with the Starch standard. However, sixth grade 
pupils will be in school two years longer, and under the present 
régime will write and continue to improve their writing for 
two years. This naturally raises the question as to whether 
the school standard for handwriting is not an artificial one, 
whereas it should be based directly upon the demands of 
society. 
There is additional evidence on this matter, as reported 
on page 24 of the First Iowa Elimination Report, as follows: 
“ One hundred graduate students of Teachers College wrote at 
a median quality less than 50. Three hundred Indiana teachers 
in Perry, Green, and Ripley Counties wrote at median quali- 
ties less than 50. One hundred inquiries for help received by 
the Social Service Bureau of New York City showed a median 
quality less than 50. One hundred applications for positions 
ranging from $10 a week to $5000 a year, received by the   
     
-P-A-G-E-50
  42 How to Measure 
Social Service Bureau of New York City, showed a median 
quality of 60. Signatures on 1oo bank checks showed a 
median quality of 41. 256 signatures on a hotel register 
showed a median quality of 41.1.’ It appears from the above 
that the adult social standard is fully satisfied by a quality of 
50 for practically all purposes. Even in the case of appli- 
cants for positions, where there is a special incentive for good 
writing, the median rises only to 60. On the basis of social 
usage, therefore, it appears that a quality of 60 on the Ayres 
scale should be accepted as satisfactory for any grade of 
school work, and that when pupils have attained a quality of 
60, with reasonable speed, they should be excused from further 
writing drill unless a pupil voluntarily chooses to continue. 
It will be observed from Table 6 that most 7th and 8th grade 
medians fall between 50 and 60. A quality of 60 therefore 
appears reasonable and attainable for upper grades. A 
higher standard except for special commercial positions would 
be artificial and unreasonable. 
What should be accepted as a reasonable speed from the 
standpoint of society has not been determined in any authori- 
tative manner. It is quite probable that a speed of 60 or 70 
letters per minute is sufficient to meet almost any situation. 
It would seem, therefore, that a teacher who brings her 
pupils to a quality of 60 and a speed of 60 has prepared them to 
meet the handwriting demands of society. Many pupils, 
because of special interests or superior abilities, will prefer 
to go above this, easily meeting the extreme social demands 
where handwriting of superior quality is required. 
Remedial Instruction. — When the sixth grade teacher has 
distributed her scores as shown in Table 3, and has decided 
what should be considered a reasonable standard in speed and 
quality for sixth grade pupils, her next question is how to 
remedy the situation for the pupils who are below standard 
in speed and quality. Studies have indicated that merely 
extending the time for the writing work will not solve the   
      
 
-P-A-G-E-51
  
The Measurement of Handwriting 43 
problem. In fact, there is much evidence that children write 
too much and fall into careless habits for that reason. The 
story of how to remedy the defects is a long one, and will not 
be taken up fully in this discussion. The teacher is referred 
to other sources, particularly to the ‘“‘ Teaching of Hand- 
writing,’ by Frank N. Freeman. There are certain phases of 
the work of remedying defects, however, which have been 
subjected to definite measurement. 
Freeman has constructed a series of writing scales or charts, 
based upon the most common defects of the pupils’ writing. 
These scales or charts deal respectively with — 1, Uniformity 
of slant; 2, Uniformity of alignment; 3, Quality of line; 
4, Letter formation; 5, Spacing. Each chart contains 
three qualities of excellence, illustrating good, average, and 
poor qualities of handwriting from the standpoint of the 
characteristic dealt with in the particular chart. 
The teacher who is especially interested in writing, and 
especially the writing supervisor, will find it worth while to 
make use of Freeman’s analytical charts. By carefully 
selecting samples of the pupils’ writing she can for her own 
use make up charts similar to the Freeman charts, thus 
having available for showing to the pupils samples that 
illustrate desirable and undesirable features under uniformity 
of slant, uniformity of alignment, etc. 
Table 8, given herewith, should prove especially helpful, 
as it indicates the causes for the various defects. The teacher 
and pupil should work together in applying this table to the 
pupil’s writing. If a pupil is writing with too much slant, 
the teacher will do well to study the pupil in the light of 
the five suggested causes. It may be a matter so simple as 
having the paper in the wrong position — and so with other 
defects. It is a matter of studying the situation with the 
particular pupil, analyzing the defect, finding the cause, and 
helping the pupil to apply the remedy.

The teacher may find it advisable to extend the list of 
defects, and this can doubtless best be done by making use of 
the analytical score card for handwriting, developed by Dr. C. 
Truman Gray of the University of Texas. It is indicated 
herewith, Figure 2. Dr. Gray’s score card is in many respects 
more complete than the detail of defects listed by Dr. Free- 
man. 
The teacher will do well to enlist the pupil fully in the 
attempt to improve his writing. For the most part the pupil

simply knows that his writing is poor. He doesn’t know why 
it is poor, and he is given no help in applying proper remedies. 
If he realizes, for instance, that it is a question of slant, or of 
uniformity in spacing, or uniformity in height, or neatness, — 
that is, if he can be made to place his attention upon some 
particular defect and work toward the correction of that 
defect, he can feel that he is working toward some definite 
end and not merely drilling aimlessly upon writing. The 
teacher’s business here is to teach, not to scold, not to find 
fault. The teacher may not find it advisable to use the Gray 
score card, so far as actually scoring the pupils’ work is con- 
cerned, but she can use it along with Freeman’s suggestions 
in discovering with the pupil the defects which need remedy- 
ing. In time the teacher may be able to construct a chart 
showing letter defects similar to Freeman’s, but made up en- 
tirely from work of her own pupils. Freeman’s chart! shows 
the correct form of a letter, together with the usual defects. 
It will help to furnish an answer to the pupil’s “ Why,” 
when he asks why he was marked down in writing. All 
pupils appreciate being treated with consideration and given 
an opportunity of doing a reasonable amount of thinking in 
connection with their work. 
Locating the Individual. — The discussion date remedial 
instruction shows the necessity of locating the individual. 
It is suggested that the teacher be not satisfied with the 
distribution as indicated in Table 3, but go a step farther, 
placing in the names of the particular pupils, as in Table 9. 
This will individualize the work, and will also make it more 
intelligible to the children. Raising the score in quality for 
her room then becomes a question not of blind unintelligent 
drill, but a question of improving the work of John, Mary, 
Jane, William, etc. In fact, taking the particular sixth grade 
as an example, and accepting quality 60 as the standard, it is 
observed that 14 of the pupils are already writing satisfactorily. 
1 The Teaching of Handwriting, page 135.
-P-A-G-E-55
  The Measurement of Handwriting 47 
From the standpoint of speed, 12 are writing above 60 and it is 
possible that some of the 8 writing between 51 and 60 are on 
a satisfactory basis. This analysis of the situation limits 
the teacher’s efforts to particular pupils, and enables her 
to apply her instruction where it is most needed. It also 
eliminates useless drill. At least two of the pupils writing 
at quality 60 or above are below inspeed. These are Jeanette 
and Mark. Four others, Grace, Lily, Henry, and David, are 
also below in speed or just on the line. Four who are satis- 
factory in speed are below in quality. These are Bruce, 
Ruth, Bert, and Thomas. The eight to the right and below 
the heavy lines are satisfactory in speed and quality, and 
further drill by them may be left to choice. If this plan 
were generally followed in school systems, a large amount 
of effort would be released in handwriting alone, for applica-

children, or a total of 31.3%, were writing at quality 60 or 
above. The Springfield, Illinois, survey showed that 33.3% of 
the upper elementary grade pupils were writing at 60 or above. 
In the Butte, Montana, survey 23.8% of the pupils in grades 
2 to 8 were writing at quality 60 or above. In Kansas City, 
in 1915, 16.4% of all pupils were writing at quality 60 or 
above. In the three upper grades in Kansas City these 
percentages were as follows: 
Fifth grade — 25.1% at quality 60 or above. 
Sixth grade — 39.7% at quality 60 or above. 
Seventh grade — 48.4% at quality 60 or above.

This means that in the seventh grade in the Kansas City 
schools, practically half of the children were writing at a 
satisfactory standard of quality, and should have been excused 
from further drill. 
These figures taken from city reports and surveys make it 
evident that many upper grade pupils should properly be 
excused from further writing drill, and that our illustrative

its distribution of writing ability in an intermediate or upper

applied quite generally. Some teachers, however, may 
want to require pupils to reach and maintain in all written 
work a quality somewhere above 60, even as high as 70, 
before excusing them from further drill in writing. Some

larly useful :

these distributions, and so see its rank in terms of the median 
scores.

established norm or standard. Table 1o will aid in this work.

The Freeman standards have been much used for such 
comparisons. 
3. After building scores and medians have been ascertained, 
a superintendent of a school system may desire a total city 
summary. Table 11, following herewith, permits comparison 
of the writing in any particular building with writing in the 
other buildings and the city average. This will be particularly 
interesting and stimulating to teachers, principals, and super- 
visors. 
In speed, Cleveland excels the other cities in grades five 
and six, but is below in grades seven and eight. However, 
there is some evidence that Cleveland is more nearly right 
in the matter of speed in writing than is the average of the 
twelve other cities. Likewise in quality, grades five and six 
of the Cleveland schools do better than the average of the 
twelve other cities, but grades seven and eight are below the 
average of the twelve cities.

Table 12 shows a total distribution of quality in writing 
for Salt Lake City. It will be observed that this table gives 
a different view from the distribution of medians shown for 
Cleveland in Table 6. It gives a worth while bird’s-eye 
view of the writing for the entire city. This distribution is 
particularly valuable to the superintendent and supervisors in 
showing the work yet needed on handwriting. Quality 12 
of the Thorndike scale corresponds to 60 of the Ayres scale.

explained further on in the chapter.

The Thorndike Scale.— While it is assumed that the 
teacher will doubtless use the Ayres scale, because of its 
convenience and availability, yet teachers should know of the 
Thorndike Scale, and should appreciate the fact that it was 
Dr. E. L. Thorndike who first gave us a usable scale for hand- 
writing. 
The Thorndike scale is based upon general merit, as 
determined by the judgment of a large number of competent 
judges. In this respect it differs from the Ayres scale, which 
is based entirely upon legibility. It is unnecessary at this 
point to go into the discussion of the merits of the two scales.

54 How to Measure 
It is agreed that either scale can be understood, and will give 
much better results than the old method of grading. Because 
the Thorndike scale was first developed, and its value was 
immediately appreciated by school men, it was introduced 
into a large number of school systems, and is still retained in 
many of them. For this reason it will be well to indicate 
standards of quality according to the Thorndike scale. 
The numbers are quite definite since the samples on the 
Thorndike scale range from 4 to 18. The Thorndike scale 
was used in the Butte survey, and Table 13 shows the 
complete distribution of scores in quality.

Lister-Meyers Handwriting Scales.— These scales are in 
use in the schools of Greater New York. They were pre- 
pared by Professors Lister and Meyers of the Brooklyn 
Training School for Teachers. They are printed on a sheet 
24'’X26’’ and show rankings from 90 to 20 on the three 
items: form, movement, and spacing. ‘This scale is a good 
illustration of a special adaptation based upon the type of 
writing which the supervisors are endeavoring to secure in 
the particular city. 
The teacher who is merely interested in putting her grading 
system on a scientific basis may neglect some of the present 
discussion and may secure good results by simply following 
the rules laid down for giving the tests, scoring the results, 
distributing the scores, and applying remedial instruction. 
What now seems theoretical and abstract in the measure- 
ment of handwriting will take on new significance as the 
teacher gradually masters the details of applying the work 
to her own schoolrooms. The practice will illuminate the 
theory; that which is theoretical will become practical. The 
work is of value as it modifies and improves school practice. 
Many teachers, however, will desire to know the history and 
development of the work, and in addition to a thorough 
study of the present chapter, will use the following bibli- 
ography to further study the subject.

       CHAPTER IV 
THE MEASUREMENT OF ARITHMETIC 
MEASUREMENT in arithmetic is not so simple as in spelling 
or in handwriting. Arithmetic taken as a whole involves 
many processes, and each process in turn involves particular 
difficulties. No one has attempted to measure general 
mathematical ability,’ and no one has attempted a test which 
covers the entire range of arithmetical processes. However, 
in its more essential and mechanical phases, arithmetic is 
susceptible of quite definite measurement. Since our purpose 
is to help the teacher in measuring her work to the extent that 
scales and standardized tests are available, it will be necessary 
to consider what can be measured at the present time, and 
what are the means available for doing it. 
There are at the present time five series of tests reasonably 
well standardized. The one first developed and most exten- 
sively in use is the Courtis Standard Research Tests. At the 
present time Courtis is confining his work to measurement 
of the four fundamental processes by his tests known as 
# Series B.”’ 
The Courtis tests were first made available during the 
school year of 1909-10. The first tests, known as “ Series 
A,” were tentative in nature, and have since been discontinued. 
The use of Series B has extended very rapidly. During the 
1The discovery of mathematical ability among secondary pupils has re- 
cently been attempted and a prognostic test devised. See Rogers, Agnes Low: 
“Experimental Tests of Mathematical Ability and Their Prognostic Value.”

year 1915-16 they were used in forty-two states of the Union, 
Hawaii, and two foreign countries, a total of one half million 
copies being sold. The teacher will see, therefore, that in 
making use of the Courtis tests she is becoming acquainted 
with a method of measurement which is used widely and is 
likely to be used even more extensively in the future, unless 
they are replaced by something better. The chief attention 
of the teacher will be directed to these tests. 
Courtis Arithmetic Tests, Series B.— Series B consists 
of tests in addition, subtraction, multiplication, and divi- 
sion, respectively. The test in addition consists of twenty- 
four examples, each made up of nine three-place numbers. 
They are constructed mechanically in such a way that 
each example is equal in difficulty to every other. The 
addition problems, therefore, consist of 24 different units of 
measurement, more or less in the nature of 24 foot rules, 
although not as accurately equal one to the other. The 
point of the test is to see how many of these examples can be 
solved by a pupil in a given time, — the time in this case 
being eight minutes. The examples in subtraction, multi- 
plication, and division are likewise made up on the basis of 
uniform difficulty and a definite time limit is set. The details, 
which follow herewith, give a few samples from each of the 
tests, together with the time limits.

You will be given eight minutes to find the answers to as many 
of these addition examples as possible. Write the answers on this 
paper directly underneath the examples. You are not expected 
to be able to do them all. You will be marked for both speed and 
accuracy, but it is more important to have your answers right than 
to try a great many examples.

The Measurement of Arithmetic 61 
Nature of the Examples.— The teacher may properly 
question whether the examples appearing in these tests are 
such as commonly appear in ordinary business transactions. 
That the examples of the Courtis test are more or less artificial 
from a social standpoint, and considerably more difficult than 
the transactions actually occurring under business conditions, 
is borne out by a study of the social and business use of arith- 
metic reported in Chapter 8 of the Sixteenth Yearbook of 
the National Society for the Study of Education.1 The 
teacher should remember, however, that the purpose of the 
Courtis examples is merely to test the ability of the pupils 
in the fundamentals. Examples as difficult as those appearing 
in Test 1, for instance, will involve all of the difficulties of 
simpler examples, and so in a measure justify themselves in 
that they test the extreme ability likely to be required not 
only of pupils in the public schools under any system, but 
even by the exigencies of business and social situations of 
adult life. Mr. Courtis himself has recognized the fact that 
the multiplication and division problems are entirely too 
difficult for third grade pupils, and as a result his 1916 
standards indicate a zero score for third grade pupils in 
multiplication and division. It is possible that in time 
further adjustment will be made in this same direction. 
Directions for Giving the Tests. —It is assumed that the 
teacher is not interested in a merely theoretical discussion of 
arithmetic tests, but in using them for the measurement of 
the work in her own schoolroom. ‘The next step, therefore, 
in connection with the Courtis tests is to write ? for a sufficient 
quantity of the research tests in arithmetic, series B, to enable 
her to give the test to the number of pupils which she has in 
her room. 
1This study has since been confirmed by a larger study. Wilson, G. M.:

62 How to Measure 
The teacher will have no difficulty in administering the 
tests. One or two of the tests can be given during a single 
recitation period. The time for addition is 8 minutes, for 
subtraction 4 minutes. It will doubtless be better to give 
these two tests on one day, deferring the tests in multiplica- 
tion and division until the next day. The instructions follow 
herewith. 
INSTRUCTIONS TO EXAMINERS 
1. For each room, prepare as many bundles of papers as there 
are rows of seats, putting into each bundle as many papers as there 
are seats in each row. 
2. Begin by saying, ‘‘My purpose this morning is to measure 
how well this school teaches its children how to add, subtract, 
multiply, and divide. I have here some printed tests. They are 
not examinations, because exactly these same tests are given to 
all the grades from the third through high school. They are also 
being given in other schools in this city, and in other cities all over 
the country. It is the school that is being examined to-day. If 
you treat the tests as though they were a game, you will enjoy 
them and do your best for the honor of your school. I am going 
to give each of you a set of these papers, but do not look at them 
until I tell you to do so. Will the boys and girls in the front seats 
please distribute them for me?” 
3. Distribute the papers by putting a bundle on the first desk 
in each row and letting the children do the rest. 
4. Have the children fill out the blanks at the top of the first 
page. Write the date in figures, and the time to the nearest half 
hour; thus: 9-25-1913-10: 30. 
5. Have the children read instructions for Test 1 aloud in 
concert. 
6. “Now please listen closely. In these tests it is important 
that we all start at the same time and stop at the same time. We 
can do this easily, if you follow my instructions exactly. Lay 
your papers on your desks in position to work the examples, but 
close the cover with your left hand, keeping it between your thumb 
and finger, like this (illustrate), so that you can open it quickly
-P-A-G-E-71
The Measurement of Arithmetic 63 
when I tell you to start. Take your pencil in your right hand, 
and when I say ‘Get ready,’ raise your pencil hand in the air as 
if you were going to ask a question. (Illustrate, by suiting the 
action to the words.) Then when I say ‘Start,’ you can bring 
your pencil down as you turn the cover back, and every one will 
start at the same time. When I say ‘Stop,’ I want you all to stop 
at once, and to raise your hands again so that I can see that you 
have stopped. Now I think we are ready to try the test.” 
When the second hand of the watch reaches the 55-second mark 
say “Get ready for the addition test. Hands up.” Exactly at 
the 60 mark say “Start.” 
Attow Exactity E1rcut MInuTES 
“Stop. Hands up.” Make sure all have stopped. “Count 
how many examples you have finished, and write the number in 
the score card in the corner under the number attempted. Do 
not count examples you have begun but have not finished. Your 
score is the number of the examples you have finished. I am 
coming to your desk to see that you have written it in the right 
place.” : 
7. Read the answers from an Answer Card (be sure the form 
number corresponds with that of the tests), and have the children 
check answers right or wrong, counting the number right, and 
writing it in their score cards. 
8. In similar fashion give and score the other tests. 
For Test 2, Subtraction, allow exactly FOUR minutes. 
For Test 3, Multiplication, allow exactly S[X minutes. 
For Test 4, Division, allow exactly EIGHT minutes. 
9. Give Tests x and 2 the first day, and Tests 3 and 4 the next. 
All may be given at one time if desired. 
Scoring the Results.— The teacher may save herself 
much work, and on the whole secure equally satisfactory 
returns if she has each child score his own paper at the close 
of the tests (or papers may be exchanged for scoring). This 
method has the added advantage of enlisting the interest of 
the children.
-P-A-G-E-72
  
  64 How to Measure 
Ask the child to count the number of examples for which 
he has a complete answer. This number is to be placed in the 
little square at the upper right-hand corner of the test paper, 
in the blank following “ Number Attempted.” The next 
thing to do is to read from the key, furnished with the tests, 
the correct answer to the various examples. Each pupil 
should follow, crossing out on his sheet any answer which is 
not correct. Have pupils then count the number of correct 
answers, and place the result in the upper right-hand corner, 
in the blank following ‘‘ Number Right.” If the pupil is 
made to understand the purpose of the work and the necessity 
of knowing exactly the condition of the class, and for that 
matter his own condition, there will be no difficulty in getting 
full codperation on the part of the pupils and honesty from 
every member of the class. 
At the conclusion of the test the pupil should make his 
own graph, showing attempts and rights in the four funda- 
mental processes, as per the example which follows.

progress of the children. The teacher may find it worth 
while to arrange all of the score sheets in order of excellence 
by pinning them on a piece of burlap on the side of the room. 
The pupil’s score (dotted line) appearing on the individual 
score sheet above is the record of an eighth grade pupil who 
is about average in ability. 
In order that the teacher may get an intelligent view of the 
performance of her class, it will be necessary to make a 
distribution of the class scores, and it is suggested that this 
be made in such a way as to show both speed and accuracy. 
Table 16, which follows herewith, shows such a distribution for 
35 eighth grade pupils.

  The Measurement of Arithmetic 67 
The table is to be read as follows: Out of 35 eighth 
grade pupils taking the addition test, one had a score of 
7 attempts and 4 rights, one had a score of 8 attempts and 
4 rights, etc. 
It will be observed by reading the totals at the bottom 
of the sheet that one pupil attempted seven examples, two 
attempted eight, etc. One pupil in the class attempted as 
many as sixteen examples. The median score for attempts 
is 01) 
The next question is, what proportion of the examples 
attempted were solved correctly. Totals for this may be 
read from the right-hand column. It will be observed that 
the one pupil who attempted seven problems solved four of 
them correctly. Of the two pupils who attemted eight, one 
solved four correctly, the other five. The one pupil who at- 
tempted 16 problems solved twelve of them correctly. The 
median performance of the group was seven problems solved 
correctly, and this is 63.6% of the median for attempts. 
It is quite evident from a study of the distribution that there 
is a wide range of ability in the class. The two pupils who 
solved twelve problems correctly certainly did three times as 
well as the two pupils who solved four problems correctly. 
Naturally the next question is, what is a reasonable standard 
for this particular eighth grade, and likewise for each of the 
grades. 
Standard Scores.— The question is best answered by 
indicating the standards set up by Courtis, and by noting 
the performance of children throughout the country. The 
standards set up by Courtis are based upon an experience of 
five years and the scoring of thousands of test papers. In 
general, Courtis has placed his standards slightly above the 
median performance of children throughout the United 
States. The standards are indicated in Table 17, which 
follows herewith, and the median performances are shown in 
Table 18.

  Standard of Accuracy 100% 
The standards are given in Table 17, for the year 1915 as 
well as for 1916. The fact that after four or five years of 
work Courtis is still changing his standards tends to give the 
teacher a feeling of security in case her own results vary con- 
siderably from the standards. In fact, the individual teacher 
should not worry greatly about the standards, although they 
will be found valuable, and an attempt should be made to 
reach them. The work most helpful to the teacher, however, 
is the distribution of the scores for her own children, and the 
next section will discuss the significance of such distribution 
for a class. 
The teacher who is interested in knowing what the per- 
formance of children elsewhere has been, is directed to Table 
18. This gives the median performance of thousands of 
children for grades 4 to 8 inclusive throughout the country. 
Under each grade the first line gives the median as deter- 
mined by Courtis in 1916, and on which he has based his 1916 
standards. The second line under each grade gives the 
same data for 1915. The next four lines under each grade 
give the 1915 performance as reported from Indiana, Iowa, 
Kansas, and Boston, respectively. It is suggested that the
-P-A-G-E-77
    
The Measurement of Arithmetic 69 
teacher study this table with particular reference to the grade 
or grades included in her own room. Is a spéed of 11 and 
an accuracy of 63.6%, as shown for the eighth grade in Table 
16, up to the average of children throughout the country? 
How much better is it than the average eighth grade child 
did in Indiana in 1915? How much below the Boston median 
performance? The answer to these questions will interest 
the children fully as much as they interest the teacher. 
With the above questions in mind, and with the standards 
as given in Table 17, and the median performances as given 
in Table 18 before her, the teacher may now return to the 
distribution of grades for the 35 eighth grade pupils shown in 
Table 16. The median attempts for the 35 pupilsare rz. The 
Courtis standard in addition for 1915 and 1916 is 12. It 
appears, therefore, that the median performance of the class 
is one below standard, so far as speed is concerned. It will 
be observed, however, that Boston alone, as shown in Table 18, 
equals or exceeds the Courtis standard. Courtis’s own sum- 
mary for performance in 1916 shows 10.2 as the median for the 
eighth grade (Table 18). It appears, therefore, that this 
particular eighth grade has done a little better than the eighth 
grade pupils reported on by Courtis in 1915 or 1916, and also 
a little better than the eighth grade pupils included in the 
summaries for Indiana, Iowa, or Kansas. In view of this 
comparison, the teacher may feel that her grade is on a 
reasonably satisfactory basis so far as speed is concerned. 
Turning now to accuracy, it is observed that this particular 
eighth grade class has an accuracy of 63.6%. Courtis calls 
for 100%. This, however, was not attained by any of the five 
groups included in Table 18. In addition the Boston eighth 
grade did best with an accuracy of 78%. It will be observed, 
however, that no one of the five groups goes quite as low as 
this particular eighth grade. This fact and the scattered 
distribution noted above emphasize the importance of giving 
attention to the addition work of this particular eighth grade.

The Measurement of Arithmetic 7 
Remedial Instruction. — In discussing remedial instruction 
it will be well to recur again to the distribution of the eighth 
grade pupils shown in Table 16. The fact that no pupil 
reaches 100% accuracy indicates that the addition com- 
binations are not fully mastered by any member of the class, 
that the addition problems in the test are too difficult for the 
mental attainments of the group, or that pupils are careless 
in their procedure. There may be other explanations of in- 
accuracy. Let us assume, however, that the first reason is the 
one which obtains with this particular grade, and it is quite 
likely the correct reason for most members of the class, since 
we may assume that an eighth grade class should be able to 
solve problems as difficult as those used in the test, and that 
if the test is administered properly, carelessness will not be 
very evident in the returns. The question, therefore, is 
how to re-teach the number combinations in such a way 
that they will be thoroughly known by every member of the 
class. It is not the province of the present work to discuss 
methods in any extended way, but merely to show the use of 
standard tests. If this test has revealed the defect correctly, 
it is then the teacher’s problem to become acquainted with 
the methods which will enable her to teach the addition com- 
binations. In brief, one of the best courses in arithmetic! 
indicates three steps in teaching the addition combinations: 
first, the mastery of the 45 elementary combinations and their 
reverses; second, carrying these same combinations up 
through the decades and drilling on the same until proficiency 
is obtained; and third, column addition. 
If the teacher does not understand the details involved in 
these three steps, she will of course need to become acquainted 
with them. In discovering exactly what a particular pupil’s 
difficulty is, the teacher will find it exceedingly valuable to 
have the pupil take one of the test examples at the board and

published by Warwick and York (in press).

72 How to Measure 
proceed with his work orally. This will enable the teacher 
to follow and accurately observe the pupil’s mental processes. 
The above discussion emphasizes the fact that drill alone 
is not the most important consideration. The first duty 
of the teacher is to discover the difficulties of individual 
pupils. Then pupils can be grouped according to common 
difficulties. In this connection it may be mentioned that the 
Boston score, which stands well at the top, is a result obtained 
after careful procedure in diagnosis and correction, followed 
by needed drill, according to directions similar to the above, 
for a period of three years. Equally satisfactory results have 
been obtained in other cities where superior skill has directed 
the work in the mechanical phases of the fundamenial pro- 
cesses. For example, the results obtained in an Indiana 
city ' under a teacher who helped in making the Connersville 
course of study in arithmetic and was interested in the first 
use of the Courtis tests in that city, are not only much above 
the Indiana median, but they are even above the Boston 
average. These results were obtained by (1) systematizing 
the drill for the class as a whole, and (2) discovering the 
difficulties of individual pupils and giving the necessary 
specific help. All agree that drill, to be effective, must be 
intelligently systematized, and given at frequent intervals. 
Retesting.— After the teacher has worked with her 
pupils faithfully, as individuals and as a class, she will want 
to retest the class in order to measure the results of her 
efforts. This may be done at any time, and the results will 
interest the members of the class fully as much as the teacher. 
The rules must be observed carefully in order that the test 
may be real and in order that comparisons may be valid. 
Table 19 shows the results of a retest of the 35 pupils 
shown in Table 16, after four months of careful work. The 
table shows that the pupils are still widely scattered in 
ability, but that the class as a whole has made good improve-

ment. The median of attempts has been raised from 11 to 
12, and of rights from 7 toro. The improvement in accuracy 
from 63.6% to 83.3% is very satisfactory. Because of in- 
dividual differences, a teacher may expect wide variations in 
speed within an eighth grade class, but she should not be

Since the results in addition as shown in Table 16 were

and since the standards as brought out in Tables 17 and 18 are 
based upon May tests, the teacher of the grade whose results 
are shown in Tables 16 and 19 may reasonably expect that 
her pupils will be up to standard when she gives the tests in 
May.

Other Arithmetic Tests. — Other available tests at the 
present time are the Stone Reasoning Tests, the Woody 
Arithmetic Scales, the Boston Tests in Addition of Fractions, 
the Cleveland Survey Arithmetic Tests, and the Monroe 
Diagnostic Tests in Arithmetic. These tests will in turn be
-P-A-G-E-83
  
The Measurement of Arithmetic 75 
described briefly, more particular attention being given to 
the Stone Reasoning Tests and the Woody Arithmetic Scales, 
as these are needed to supplement the Courtis tests, and can 
be used by teachers without particular difficulty. It is 
evident that what can be measured in arithmetic depends 
somewhat on the test being used. In general it is the per- 
formance of the pupils which is tested, and this may include 
speed and accuracy, or accuracy only, according to how the 
tests are administered. The purpose in arithmetic, as in all 
testing, should be to find out the present condition of the child, 
in order to prescribe remedies in case he needs help, or in 
order to release him from further drill, in case he is fully up 
to reasonable standards. 
Reasoning Tests. — When arithmetic is put to practical 
business use, it is always connected with an actual situation, 
and the solution requires judgment or reasoning as to the 
processes involved. For upper grade work no test of arith- 
metic is complete which fails to test reasoning ability. The 
Stone Reasoning Test has been most used. It consists of 
twelve problems, ranging in value from 1 to 2, as follows:

after it has gone 56 miles? 
  
  
The papers are scored by giving to each problem solved 
correctly the value as indicated at the left of each problem 
in the above. The test was first formulated for upper sixth 
grade pupils, but it is equally good for seventh or eighth
-P-A-G-E-85
    The Measurement of Arithmetic 77 
grade pupils. It is too difficult for good results in grades 
below the sixth. 
Dr. Stone has recently issued‘ the following grade 
standards : : 
  Grane | StaNDARD 
5 Score of 5.5, reached or exceeded by 80%, 75% accuracy. 
6 | Score of 6.5, reached or exceeded by 80%, 80% accuracy. 
a Score of 7.5, reached or exceeded by 80%, 85% accuracy. 
8 | Score of 8.75 reached or exceeded by 80%, 90% accuracy, 
  
It is quite probable that the median scores secured through 
the use of the Stone reasoning tests in various surveys form a 
more usable standard than the one suggested by Dr. Stone. 
These scores are shown in Table 20.

The teacher will find it worth while to use the Stone reason- 
ing tests, although the standards are not so definite as for 
the Courtis tests in the fundamentals. It will be simpler 
to take the returns from a single city, as for example, Salt

Lake City standard, they aré not doing as well as pupils 
have done in an average city system. 
Diagnostic Tests.— The teacher who has followed the 
discussion closely will appreciate the fact that the Courtis 
tests, while measuring ability, do not analyze the difficulties 
and do not permit the teacher to use them easily for analyzing 
a pupil’s shortcomings. This defect of the Courtis tests is 
being overcome gradually by the formation of other tests 
which have better diagnostic possibilities. Among these are 
the Woody Arithmetic Scales. 
Woody Scales. — The Woody scales were not originally 
designed for diagnostic purposes, but they are being made to 
serve that purpose, as well as their original purpose of measuring 
the ability of children. They are constituted quite differently 
from the Courtis tests. Each Courtis test consists of a series 
of problems of equal difficulty in one of the fundamental 
processes. The Woody scales consist of a series of problems 
of increasing difficulty. They are designed to measure work 
in the four fundamental operations: addition, subtraction, 
multiplication, and division. Whileconstructed ona statistical 
basis rather than for the purpose of serving as the basis of an 
analysis of subject matter needs, yet at the same time they 
do cover subject matter reasonably well. The addition scale, 
for instance, covers simple combinations in one, two, three, 
and four column addition; examples with addends from two 
to sixteen ; addition of simple fractions; addition of decimals ; 
addition of U. S. money; addition of denominate numbers ; 
and addition of mixed numbers. The additions are ex- 
pressed in column form and by the plus sign. Thus the 
pupil is tested, more or less, over the entire range of addition 
possibilities, by a series of problems ranging in difficulty 
from those so simple that any third grade pupil may solve 
them, up to other problems so difficult that few eighth grade 
pupils succeed in solving them. This will appear by exami-

Directions for Giving Woody Tests. — The directions for 
‘administering the Woody scales accompany the sheets, 
which may be secured from Teachers College Bureau of 
Publications. It is quite essential that uniform methods be 
followed in order to make results comparable. The papers 
are distributed with face down. When pupils are ready with 
pencils in hand, they are told to turn over the paper and 
answer the questions at the top of the page. The specific 
directions for the addition test as given by Dr. Woody are as 
follows: ‘‘ Every problem on the sheet which I have given 
you ‘is an addition problem, an ‘and problem.’ Work as 
many of these problems as you can and be sure you get them 
right. Do all of your work on this piece of paper and don’t 
ask anybody any questions. Begin.” 
For the series A scales, twenty minutes are allowed for 
each test. There are shortened scales, series B, which are 
given in ten minutes each, but since the purpose in using the 
Woody scales will doubtless be to benefit more or less by their 
diagnostic values, it is assumed that teachers will prefer to 
use the longer scales of series A. It may be noted at this 
point that the time for giving the tests has been varied.? 
While a shortened time gives slightly better distributions, 
particularly in the upper grades, yet the problems at the upper 
end of the scales are so difficult that few pupils will solve 
them even when given all of the time necessary. As a 
matter of fact, 20 minutes, the time allowed, is sufficient for 
most upper grade pupils to complete any one of the tests. 
The result is that in the upper grades, accuracy only is 
measured. But in using the Woody scales, it is likely that 
accuracy is the thing in which the teacher will be chiefly 
interested. 
In using the other Woody scales, the directions are the 
same as for addition except the substitution of such expressions 
as “ subtract or ‘ take away’ problems ”; “ multiplication or

‘times’ problems”; “ division or ‘into’ problems,” for 
“addition or ‘and’ problems.” In case the teacher has used 
other expressions to indicate one of the processes, these may 
be substituted for the expressions “and” problem, etc. 
The purpose in using these extra expressions is to make clear 
to the child the process which is involved in the particular 
test. 
The standard for marking the examples in the Woody scales 
is absolute accuracy, and the final answer should be in its 
lowest terms. The table on the opposite page gives the cor- 
rect list of answers. 
The method of tabulating the results of the Woody tests is 
very simple. Assuming that a test has been given, indicate 
on the upper corner of each page the number of problems 
solved correctly. Then, for convenience, arrange the papers 
in order according to the number of problems solved. With 
the papers thus arranged, it will be possible to draw off di- 
rectly the results of the test as shown in Table 22. This table 
shows the distribution of a class of 35 with reference to the 
number of problems solved by the different members. 
Table 22 is taken directly from the results of a division test 
given in an intermediate grade,! November 1, 1917. The 
distribution of pupils’ scores resulting from giving the Woody 
Test in Division, Series A, is shown for the entire school 
system in Table 23. 
This is the same form as shown in Table 22, except that it 
covers five grades, and the number of pupils in each grade is 
the complete number for the entire city. The superintendent 
of this school system has shown, exceptionally well, the 
diagnostic possibilities of the Woody scales. In the study 
referred to, he analyzes the division difficulties of pupils as 
shown by the errors they have made in attempting to solve 
the problems in the division scale. It will be well for the

teacher to summarize for her class the number of wrong 
solutions for each problem attempted. This can be shown 
for a single test by a table similar to Table 22, in which the 
problems are listed by number on the left, and the number of 
incorrect solutions shown on the right. In the final analysis, 
however, the teacher should study each paper to see what 
mistakes each particular pupil made. This should be done 
in each of the fundamental processes. If the Woody scales 
are used to supplement the Courtis tests for the purpose of 
finding out where the pupil made his mistakes, it will be found 
exceedingly valuable. The various types of errors made in 
division in the city referred to were summarized by the 
superintendent and his teachers as follows: 
1. Ignorance of multiplication tables, 30 per cent. TIlustra-

The teacher with her particular grade should proceed in a 
similar manner, taking up each fundamental process and dis- 
covering the types of errors made. It will be well to note, 
not only the errors made, but after each, the names of the 
pupils making that particular mistake in order that she may 
give special attention to all of the pupils making a particular 
mistake. Suppose, for example, that one of the teachers in 
the above city, on a certain day, desires to work upon the 
fourth one of the listed errors, namely inability to handle the 
remainder. In an intermediate class of 35 pupils, she may 
have four who need help on this point. By referring to her 
paper she will be able to call the names of the four who need 
special instruction. So with each particular mistake, she 
will be able to call for the pupils who need help, permitting 
others in the class to spend their time in some other way. 
The superintendent and his teachers in the city referred to, 
noted that long division was difficult for the pupils, and so made 
a special summary of the errors in long division, as follows: 
1. The assumption that the first integer of the divisor may 
be used always as a trial divisor. 
The trial-and-error method of finding quotient. 
Ignorance of multiplication tables. 
Carrying wrong number when multiplying. 
Borrowing in subtraction. 
Ignorance of value of cipher. 
Forgetting to place integers in quotient. 2.

This is a good illustration of the diagnostic use of tests 
as a basis for remedial instruction. Such use of tests makes 
them of direct service in the work of helping pupils, and this 
is a use that must in future receive more and more attention. 
The Woody tests are being quite extensively used. During 
the year 1917-1918, 300,000 copies of the tests were used by 
school men in the United States. This extensive use is 
gradually developing standards of performance. Instead of 
giving standards alone, it will be more helpful to list the 
returns from a number of cities. Accordingly there are given

Boston ResEArcH TESTS IN FRACTIONS 
These tests are not generally available and are given in this 
connection to suggest to the teacher the possibility of becoming 
keen and active in the work of discovering pupils’ errors. The 
Boston test in addition of fractions consists of six simple 
tests of four problems each, each test having a two-minute 
time limit. They cover the various types of problems in the 
addition of fractions, and they increase in difficulty from the 
first example in which the denominators are the same, up 
to the last in which the common denominator can be deter- 
mined with difficulty by introspection. The test follows 
herewith :

These tests as given in the Boston schools proved especially 
helpful in the work of analyzing the difficulties of pupils and 
devising drills to raise the efficiency of the children. This 
was evidenced by the increase in both speed and accuracy in 
tests given during the following spring to selected sixth grades. 
The teacher should find these tests in addition of fractions 
very useful, and she can make comparisons on the basis of 
her own rules for scoring. 
The Boston tests in the subtraction of fractions will be 
equally suggestive and helpful to the teacher who is attempt- 
ing to analyze the types of problems and the difficulties en- 
countered by children in the solution of problems in sub- 
traction of fractions. The tests as given follow herewith.

Tests were also devised in the multiplication and division 
of fractions. Some of these tests are quite difficult and yet 
for diagnostic purposes they will show the ability of children 
to multiply or divide fractions and mixed numbers. The 
tests are indicated herewith, and city medians are summarized 
in Table 27.

It will be observed, from Table 27, that the scores in tests 2, 
4, and 6 are very low, indicating that they were not well 
chosen. Referring to these particular tests, Dr. Ballou of 
the Boston bureau says:
-P-A-G-E-104
    
096 How to Measure 
“It is probably true that there is no great use for the type of 
work shown in these three tests in practical life, but the business 
world does require it to some extent; business courses in our high 
schools require the processes, and the new course of study requires 
this work. In view of these three conditions, it was thought best 
to include these three tests in order that we might have some facts 
on which to base the development of our work in multiplication 
and division of fractions.”

On the basis of this statement we may expect that the 
course of study in Boston will be improved by much elimi- 
nation and better adaptation to business usage. Tests will 
be used more and more in the work of revising courses of 
study. 
Cleveland Survey Tests. — One of a number of hopeful 
signs in the development of arithmetic tests is the clear 
recognition that they should be of direct value in helping the 
children. This recognition is leading quite clearly to the 
more extensive development of diagnostic tests. The tests
-P-A-G-E-105
The Measurement of Arithmetic 97 
used in the Cleveland survey were prepared in codperation 
with Mr. Courtis, who recognized as clearly as any one else the 
need of supplementary work in order to make his standard 
tests, series A and B, of sufficient value to the teacher whose 
duty is to improve the pupils in their work. No attempt will 
be made in this place to describe or discuss fully the Cleveland 
survey tests.! The tests, now slightly revised, are composed of 
15 different sets of examples designated as A, B, C, D, E, F, 
G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O. They are intended to cover the 
“fundamentals” of arithmetic. Of the 15 tests, four are 
in addition; two in subtraction; three in multiplication; four 
in division; and two in fractions. They constitute to an 
extent a spiral arrangement of tests, increasing in difficulty 
from A to O. The actual time covered. by the tests is 22 
minutes, and this combined with the time necessary to pass 
from one test to another led to the direction, in connection 
with the Grand Rapids survey, that two days be taken for 
the tests; the first nine sets being given on the first day and 
the remaining six sets being given on the following day.- As 
indicated, the sets were devised in codperation with Mr. 
Courtis and they follow the Courtis Practice Forms more or 
less closely. These forms were used in the Grand Rapids 
schools so that the results secured in Grand Rapids may be 
considered quite satisfactory. The results in the Cleveland 
schools were more satisfactory in the lower grades but a little 
less so in the upper grades. Table 28, following herewith, 
shows the average of the median scores in each of the arith- 
metic tests for grades 3 to 8 in Cleveland and Grand Rapids. 
This table may be considered as setting tentative standards 
for the Cleveland survey tests for the various grades.

School,” a volume of The Cleveland Survey; School Survey of Grand Rapids, 
Mich., Chap. VI; “Arithmetic Tests and Studies in the Psychology of

lend themselves quite well to diagnostic purposes. Set A 
tests the pupils’ knowledge of the addition combinations; 
set E is a simple test in column addition; set J involves 
more difficult column addition; and set M requires carrying 
as well as column addition, and conforms to business usage 
more closely than the Courtis Series B. 
Subtraction is tested in sets B and F; multiplication in 
sets C, G, and L; division in sets D, I, K, and N; and frac- 
tions in sets H and O. In each of the fundamental processes 
and in fractions, the first set is quite simple and each later 
set grows more difficult. The detail shown above in addition 
represents the plan in each process. The diagnostic use of the 
Cleveland tests may best be illustrated by taking some actual 
cases. Mary S., a pupil in the eighth grade, thirteen years 
old, makes no mistakes in any of the tests in addition. She 
solves every problem attempted, but her score for the various 
tests in addition is low. They run as follows: A 19, E 5, J 4, 
M 4. The standards for these tests in the eighth grade as 
shown by the Cleveland and Grand Rapids reports (see Table 
28) are A 28.9, E 8.0, J 6.1, M 5.4. It appears, therefore, 
that Mary S. needs to continue her present accuracy in addi- 
tion but increase her speed. In subtraction she makes a 
mistake in test B in subtracting 9 from 11, but her score in 
subtraction is low in both test B and test F. In multiplication 
she is inaccurate as well as slow, making two mistakes in 
set C which are the simple combinations. In division she is 
exceedingly slow. In set K in division the standard score for 
the eighth grade according to Table 28 is 11.4. Mary S. has 
a score of 1. 
Turning to the record of Hazel R., a thirteen-year-old girl
-P-A-G-E-109
  The Measurement of Arithmetic IOI 
in the eighth grade, it appears that her scores are down 
throughout, but that her inaccuracies are chiefly in sets H 
and O. These tests, as will be noted above, relate to simple 
fractions. However, in addition, Hazel R. has difficulty. 
She solves twenty problems in set A all correctly and four 
in set E correctly, but in set J involving a column of thirteen 
figures she fails on every problem attempted. In set M, 
five addends of four-place numbers, she fails on one out of 
three attempted. 
It is evident, from the above, that rather detailed analysis 
of the pupils’ difficulties is easily made from the results of the 
Cleveland tests., When pupils pass set A with proper speed 
and accuracy it means that they know the addition com- 
binations. When they fail on set J it means that the more 
complex numbers involve too much mental effort or that the 
drill on decades has not been sufficient, doubtless the latter, 
because many pupils who know that four and eight are twelve 
fail when the combination is twenty-four and eight. In like 
manner, a pupil’s paper will show for the other fundamental 
processes and simple fractions just where his difficulties be- 
gin and, therefore, just where the teacher needs to begin in 
order to give the necessary help. How to analyze the arith- 
metic difficulties in an entire city system through the use of 
the Cleveland survey tests has been shown by Dr. George 
S. Counts in the School Review Educational Monograph, 
number IV. 
Kansas Diagnostic Tests in Arithmetic. — The Bureau of 
Educational Measurement and Standards, of the State 
Normal School at Emporia, Kansas, has done a notable work 
in connection with the measurement of subject matter. The 
fact that the tests in arithmetic, finally put out by this 
Bureau, were diagnostic in nature, may be taken as a further 
indication that, in the future, increasing importance will be 
attached to diagnostic tests. The Kansas Tests in Arithmetic 
have not been extensively tried out and so are not well

covering the 21 tests. These are the midyear scores and are 
based upon results of testing from 300 to 1200 pupils in each 
of the grades. Table 29, which follows herewith, gives these 
tentative standards for the first six tests.

The value of these tests can be ascertained only by extended 
use. They follow rather closely the line of testing marked 
out by the Cleveland survey tests. Tests 7 to 11 cover 
operations with integers in the fundamentals and are similar 
to tests 1 to 6, except that they are more difficult. Tests 
12 to 16 cover operations with common fractions. These 
tests are simple and not beyond reasonable business demands. 
They should be of value in helping teachers to locate a pupil’s 
difficulties in handling fractions. Tests 17 to 21 deal with
-P-A-G-E-113
The Measurement of Arithmetic 105 
the multiplication and division of decimals and relate par- 
ticularly to the problem of placing the decimal point. There 
will quite surely be objections to these tests because the 
examples in the tests are more difficult than problems in 
decimals which appear in common business practice. It is 
' apparent that the test in decimals has been based upon an 
analysis of textbook material rather than actual usage. 
The Teacher’s Problem. — In view of the many tests in 
arithmetic which are now available, the teacher may feel 
confused and uncertain as to just how she should proceed. 
Apparently the best method would be to master, one at a 
time, the details of testing achievement in arithmetic. The 
teacher will do well to start with the tests which developed 
first historically, namely, the Courtis tests, series B. While 
these tests have defects which are admitted even by their 
author, yet they are better standardized than any other tests 
at the present time and so will best answer the purpose of 
measuring achievement in arithmetic, particularly for upper 
grade pupils. They are as serviceable as any other tests at the 
present time. When the teacher feels confident that she 
understands the Courtis tests, knows how to administer them, 
to grade them and to apply them to the remedial work in her 
own schoolroom, then she may properly take up the Woody 
scales for the fundamentals. Theseare quite well standardized. 
They are easily administered and they are valuable for diag- 
nostic purposes. Many teachers will not use other tests. 
Some however, will begin to see the advantage of standard 
tests and will desire to take up the Cleveland survey tests, 
applying them to their own schools, comparing their schools 
with others which have been measured by these tests, but 
particularly using them for locating the weaknesses of their 
own pupils. These tests were originally designed for diagnostic 
[purposes and they seem well calculated to serve this purpose. 
In a year of earnest work, the teacher should master testing 
upils in abstract numbers, should locate the shortcomings

  106 How to Measure 
of her class, and should make decided progress toward bringing 
the entire class to standard. Many teachers will prefer to 
wait until a second year to begin the use of the reasoning tests. 
This may be a wise procedure because their use should be 
followed by a thorough study of reasoning problems, the 
progressive steps which pupils must take in mastering such 
problems, and the business demands for such problems. A 
valuable study on reasoning problems, and the successive steps 
in their mastery, is found in the Connersville Course of Study 
in Elementary Mathematics. Since figuring which is done in 
actual business is always connected with situations requiring 
reasoning, the teacher should not fail to carry forward her 
work until she has mastered the details of administering, 
scoring, and interpreting reasoning tests. 
The Next Step. — What is the next step in measurement in 
arithmetic? Some say it is to devise tests for the measure- 
ment of the higher processes in arithmetic. This may be so, 
but it is to be hoped that before such tests are formulated, 
the needs of common business practice will be more fully 
determined. If tests were now formulated for denominate 
numbers, percentage and its applications, mensuration, etc., 
they would almost surely represent merely textbook and 
schoolroom viewpoints. The results would doubtless be less 
satisfactory than the Kansas tests in decimals. It is to be 
hoped, therefore, that the more fundamental work of deter- 
mining the actual community and business demands of 
Arithmetic will be carried much further before any attempt 
is made to extend measurement in arithmetic to the higher 
processes. Progress is being made along this line! and in 
time we may hope to have a type of arithmetic throughout

the entire course, which is directly applicable to business usage 
and which is so taught as to further the intelligent use of 
arithmetic in business. In the meantime, teachers are quite 
safe in furthering the work of measurement in arithmetic 
in the fundamental processes and simple fractions. Teachers 
may assume that mastery here is essential, and that measure- 
ment is valid so long as applied only to the formal aspects 
of the subject.

CHAPTER V 
THE MEASUREMENT OF READING 
“Most of the reading done by people after leaving school 
will be silent reading. I am of the opinion that much more 
stress should be laid upon it in the schoolroom. The Monroe 
Standardized Silent Reading Tests are a help to the teacher at 
the beginning of the school year in finding just where the 
pupils stand in reading. They also help her to discover the 
individual needs of each pupil. Tests given at the close 
of the term show the progress made.” This statement was 
made by a teacher of a third grade after she had used the 
Monroe Standardized Silent Reading Tests for one half 
year to determine the ability and the progress of her children 
in reading. It reveals two or three important considerations 
for successful reading achievement. 
Teachers are beginning to realize the importance of placing 
more emphasis upon silent reading, since so much reading 
outside of the schoolroom is silent and since success in a voca- 
tion and happiness in leisure time depend upon the individual’s 
ability to grasp the thought on the written page. The 
statement also reveals to the teacher the importance of 
knowing in a definite and objective manner what her class 
as a whole and what each individual in her class can do in 
reading. It is also necessary to know in definite and objective 
terms the amount of progress made by the class as a whole 
and by each individual student at the expiration of a certain 
period of time. 
The importance of silent reading cannot be overestimated. 
The ability to grasp quickly the thought in a paragraph, a 
chapter, or a book, is one of the biggest contributing factors 
IIo
-P-A-G-E-119
  
The Measurement of Reading IIl 
to the success of any individual. The ability to master 
quickly the thought in modern literature, current events, 
history, etc., determines to a large extent the progress and 
development of the individual among his fellow men. It has 
much to do with his happiness during his whole life. If, 
therefore, reading plays such a significant part in life, is it 
not a matter of considerable importance that, in the training 
of the child to master the symbols with which ideas are ex- 
pressed, the best methods of instruction be used, his capacity 
be trained to the fullest extent with the least degree of waste, 
and his appreciation of the best that is said and written be 
developed? ‘To this end the reading test as has been indicated 
is a most helpful instrument. 
Among the different factors that contribute to good reading, 
which is made up of the ability to interpret and remember, 
there are two which are of great importance and which 
the teacher can determine in a definite manner. These 
factors are, first, the power of comprehending thought, and 
second, the rate of reading. These two factors are important 
in both kinds of reading, namely, silent and oral. 
Since it is not the purpose of this work to make an ex- 
haustive study of all the tests on any one subject, a treatment 
is given of those reading tests only which, on account of their 
aim, simplicity of application, and extent of use are most 
serviceable in the hands of teachers. The following tests 
meet this purpose: Thorndike’s Scale Alpha 2, Courtis’s 
Silent Reading Test No. 2, Monroe’s Standardized Silent 
Reading Tests, Haggerty’s Visual Vocabulary Test, and 
Gray’s Oral Reading Tests. i 
Mownroe’s STANDARDIZED SILENT READING TESTS 
Aim. — The aim of these tests is to determine the rate at 
which children read and the extent to which they are able 
to comprehend the thought in written discourse. This is 
accomplished by having them read silently a given sentence
-P-A-G-E-120

or paragraph and then write answers to questions on the 
subject matter they have read. : 
Description of Test. — Monroe’s Standardized Silent Read- 
ing Tests have been constructed from sentences taken “ from 
school readers and other books which children read.” They 
are intended for grades three to twelve inclusive. They 
consist of three tests: 
Test one for Grades 3, 4, and 5. 
Test two for Grades 6, 7, and 8. 
Test three for Grades 9, 10, 11, and 12. 
Tests one and two have each three forms, forms 1, 
2, and 3; test three has two forms, forms 1 and 2. Each 
form is of the same degree of difficulty, but has different 
subject matter so that the same class can be examined three 
times without using the same information. The first six 
paragraphs of test 1, form 1, which has in all sixteen para- 
graphs, are given in order to show the nature of the tests:

Each test begins with a simple exercise and increases in 
comprehension value with almost each succeeding exercise. 
The measure of a child’s ability to understand or comprehend 
what he reads in each exercise forms the comprehension 
value and is placed in the right-hand margin opposite each 
I
-P-A-G-E-122

exercise. The sum of the values of those exercises done 
correctly in five minutes forms his comprehension score. 
It is important not only to know the extent to which a child 
can grasp the thought in an exercise, but also the time in 
which it takes him to grasp this thought. The child who can 
grasp the thought in an exercise in three minutes has greater 
reading ability than the child who requires five minutes to 
grasp the thought in the same exercise. Each exercise is, 
therefore, given a rate value which represents the number of 
words read per minute in careful reading. This value is 
placed on the left-hand margin opposite each exercise. The 
pupil’s reading score is the sum of the rate values given to the 
different exercises which he reads in five minutes. 
Giving the Test. — The application of this reading test is 
very simple. Full instructions are given on the front page 
of each test. Each child is provided with a separate test. 
After he has written his name, age, grade, etc., he is given 
a preliminary test which explains how he is to proceed with the 
regular test. The value of the results will depend on the 
accuracy with which these simple instructions are observed. 
Scoring the Results. —A class record sheet is provided 
with each test. A copy of this record sheet with the results 
from a 3-A grade is given in Table 30. 
The score for the class of thirty-nine children reported 
in Table 30 is given in terms of a median instead of an average. 
This median score is the score on the middle paper in the 
group of papers that is being recorded. In March, thirty- 
nine children were tested. The comprehension score on the 
zoth paper, counted from the paper receiving the lowest 
score, was 10.6. In a similar manner the median score for 
the rate of reading was determined. 
Interpreting and Using Results. — After a class has been 
tested and the results tabulated, the important work of inter- 
preting these results and applying them to particular needs 
still remains. Unless these two steps are developed to the

fullest extent the time and the energy of teacher and pupils 
are not justified. The extent to which the teacher has been 
trained or trains herself to complete the testing operation will 
determine her degree of success or failure in the use of measure- 
ments in her classroom work. 
One of the first things the teacher considers after she has 
attained the final scores for her class is the relation which they 
bear to any established standards for the test which she has 
given. 
The standards (middle of year) for the Monroe Standardized 
Silent Reading Tests are as follows: 
  
  
  Grave mt TV. AV. | vi | vir | vir | x | x | bf ||5-a0 
tones. cs, . || 52 73 | 89 | 88 | 99 | 106 87 | 81 | 88 89 
Comprehension | 7.2] 13 | 19 | 20 | 23 | 26.4] 25 | 25 | 26.4 | 27.2 
        
The scores for the 3—A class reported in Table 30 are, rate 
zo and comprehension 10.6. It will be seen, therefore, that 
the class is above the standard in both comprehension and 
rate. 
In the second place, the large spread of ability in rate and 
comprehension called for intimate knowledge with, and in- 
dividual instruction to suit, these abilities. 
By referring to the class record sheet, it will be seen that 
in rate of reading at least 21 pupils surpassed the standard 
(52) for the third grade, 15 pupils scored above the standard 
(73) for the fourth grade, and 10 pupils above the standard 
(89) for the fifth grade. In comprehension at least 26 pupils 
scored above the standard (7.2) for the third grade, at least 
7 pupils scored above the standard (13.0) for the fourth grade, 
and at least 3 pupils above the standard (19.0) for the fifth 
grade. 
A clearer picture of this situation may be secured by

Another way of seeing clearly the wide spread of ability 
in this class is by a comparison of the highest and lowest 
scores. The rate scores range from 31 words to 129 words 
per minute, and the comprehension scores from 1 to 26. 
Remedial Measures. — The first problem for the teacher 
who gave the test reported in Table 30 was to reclassify her 
grade. It would be exceedingly unfair to keep the 7 pupils 
(using comprehension as a basis) who score above the fourth 
grade standard continuing in third grade reading. These 7 
pupils should, therefore, either be promoted to a fourth grade 
(in a short time some of them may be advanced to a fifth 
grade) or given fourth grade reading work under the same 
teacher. 
A second problem is emphasis on thought getting in silent 
reading. From the low scores in both rate and comprehension 
when compared with the highest scores, it is quite cleax that 
 
-P-A-G-E-126
  118 How to Measure 
there are a good many pupils who do not grasp quickly the 
thought in what they read. The teacher who gave the test 
reports as follows: “In most cases those who received high 
rate scores also received high comprehension scores, tending 
to show that the rapid reader usually understands better 
what he reads. I, therefore, planned to give more time to 
silent reading. The pupils were questioned and marked on 
the number of questions which they were able to answer 
correctly.”’ This plan helped them to understand what they 
read and made the lesson interesting.” 
In addition to the above plans, the teacher found the follow- 
ing devices helpful: 
1. Practice was given in the selection and planning of the 
most interesting part of a story for dramatization. 
2. Directions for reading were given by indicating thought 
units rather than paragraphs or lines. For example the 
teacher says, “ William, read from the place where it tells us 
he (the character) decides to leave home,” rather than 
“ Read the next.” 
3. The pupils were given an opportunity to work up in- 
dividual assignments. 
4. The pupils were trained to outline the main points or 
events in the lesson. 
5. Considerable opportunity was given for the pupils to 
question one another on the content without quibbling or 
asking silly questions. 
6. Other examinations with the same tests were made to 
show progress. 
No one can question the value of such a procedure in which 
the teacher gives a diagnosis of a teaching problem, and 
applies corrective measures in the form of intelligent and 
systematic practice. The plan is simple so that what this 
teacher has done any teacher can do. Surely the gratification 
of knowing without a doubt whether or not success is attending 
one’s effort is worth while.

SireNT READING 
Thorndike’s Scale Alpha 2, for Measuring the Understanding 
of Sentences 
Aim. — The purpose of Thorndike’s Scale Alpha 2 is to 
measure the student’s ability to comprehend the meaning 
of sentences and paragraphs. The rate of reading is not 
measured. 
Description of Tests. — The test is divided into two parts. 
Part I may be used in grades 3 to 5; Part II in grades 6 to 12 
inclusive. The test is made up of a series of paragraphs with 
questions on the content of each paragraph. Each para- 
graph increases in difficulty over the preceding one with 
equal steps. Below are given the four sets of paragraphs in 
Part I to show the nature of the test :

eight they came, bringing two other boys with them. Tom was 
very glad to see them and gave each of them one of the apples he 
had kept. They ate these and he ate one too. Then all went on 
down the road.

It may seem at first thought that every boy and girl who goes 
to school ought to do all the work that the teacher wishes done. 
But sometimes other duties prevent even the best boy or girl from 
doing so. If a boy’s or girl’s father died and he had to work 
afternoons and evenings to earn money to help his mother, such 
might be the case. A good girl might let her lessons go undone

Hay fever is a very painful, though not a dangerous, disease. 
It is like a very severe cold in the head, except that it lasts much 
longer. (The nose runs; the eyes are sore; the person sneezes ; 
he feels unable to think or work, Sometimes he has great diffi- 
culty in breathing. Hay fever is not caused by hay, but by the 
pollen from certain weeds and flowers. Only a small number of 
people get this disease, :perhaps one person in fifty. Most of those 
who do get it can avoid it by going to live in certain places during 
the summer and fall. Almost every one can find some place where 
he does not suffer from hay fever.

Giving the Test.— The fact that the test can be easily 
given to large groups of children at once makes it a useful 
instrument in the hands of the teacher. Before the children 
are asked to take the actual test, a preliminary test with 
instructions and subject matter very similar to the regular 
test is given to make sure that every child knows exactly 
what he is to do. 
 
-P-A-G-E-130
  122 How to Measure 
A test sheet is then placed in the hands of each child. 
After he has written his name and age, he is asked to follow 
instructions which are at the head of each paragraph. He is 
given as much time as is needed to do all he can. 
Recording and Determining Scores. — The correct answers 
to the different questions under each paragraph have been 
carefully determined and arranged on an answer sheet which 
should be in the hands of each teacher. A portion of this 
answer sheet is given below: 
Key For ScALE ALPHA 2 
Difficulty 4, Element 1. “Short.” 2. “Two.” 3. “Mary.” 
Difficulty 54, Element 1. “Half past eight,” “eight thirty,” 
“8:30” or equivalent. 2. ‘Went down the road,” or equivalent 
(call “went on,” or “went on to Boston,” wrong). 3. “Two 
other boys,” or “two boys.”’ 4. “Nine o’clock.” 
Difficulty 6, Element 1. Right responses are such as: “If he 
has to work afternoons and evenings to help his mother.” “When 
their parents died.”’ ‘When the father dies.” “If his father died 
and to work.” “If his father died or if sick.” ‘His father 
might die.” ‘His father may died.” “Tf his father died he has to 
work.” “If his father or mother died.” 
Etc. 
This answer sheet in the hands of each teacher reduces the 
amount of error due to personal opinion. The rating, there- 
fore, becomes accurate to a remarkable degree. The answer 
to each question is marked right or wrong according to the 
answer on the answer sheet. 
After the marking of the papers is completed these markings 
are transferred to a class record sheet. This sheet has on 
it the number of each question under each set. It calls for 
the name of each child and his scores opposite under each set. 
Table 31 shows a copy of a record sheet from a 5—B grade 
in‘a city school system in which the Thorndike Scale Alpha

If a child’s answer to a question is correct the space opposite 
his name for this question is left vacant. If the answer is | 
wrong a zero representing an error is recorded. The total 
number of errors which each child makes on each line is then 
determined. The value of the line on which he makes errors 
not to exceed 20% is his score. The total number of errors 
for the entire class is determined for each line. The value of 
the line which gives 20% of error is the score for the class. 
If no line gives exactly 20% of error the value of the line which 
gives nearest to 20% is used. 
On the preceding record sheet, the class made 10.4% of 
errors on the line under Set II and 38.8% of errors on the 
line under Set III. The line which gave nearest to 20% of 
errors is Set II, Difficulty 5.25. By referring to a table of 
errors (index) it will be seen that when a line gives 10.4% 
of errors, .62 is to be added to the value of this line to secure 
the score. The score for this class is, therefore, 5.25, the 
value of Set II, plus .62, or 5.87. 
Interpreting the Results. — This test is of great assistance 
to the teachers on account of its diagnostic value. Teaching 
the child to get the thought in what he reads is one of her 
most difficult and yet most important tasks. With the aid 
of this test the teacher can determine accurately his ability to 
comprehend the thought in a sentence or paragraph in con- 
junction with the class as a whole or with each member of 
the class. 
The class record sheet given above reveals the fact that 
the ability of the different children to understand the thought 
in these paragraphs varies widely. For example M. H. and 
G. S.1 answered each question correctly in Sets II and III. 
On the contrary A. S. answers three questions out of four 
correctly in Set II and only two out of seven in Set III. 
D. C. answers all the questions in Set II correctly but only 
one out of seven in Set III. Every teacher should keep before 
her the class record sheet and also each child’s test sheet.
-P-A-G-E-133
The Measurement of Reading 125 
From these sheets she can tell the kind of instruction each 
child should receive; they will likewise tell her if he should be 
advanced to another grade. In fact, since thought getting is 
such an important factor in practically all subjects, the teacher 
will have considerable information about each child’s general 
progress. 
The following table shows the grade scores in a particular 
school in comparison with the Indiana medians : 
  
  
    TABLE 32

Indiana medians 5.48 6.56 7.56 8.46] 8.72) 9. 
  
  
The above comparison reveals the fact that the reading 
ability in the school was below the median scores in the 
Indiana cities. 
The general conclusion of the teachers in this building was, 
therefore, that the children were not able to interpret the 
thought in a written sentence or paragraph. 
Using the Results. — The value of this test will be found 
in the direct application of the results to classroom practice. 
Practically every recitation affords such an opportunity. 
Getting the thought in what has been said or read is the big 
problem in all teaching. The teachers of the school in which 
the results in Table 32 were secured report as follows: ‘‘ We 
stressed thought getting in all subjects such as geography, 
history, arithmetic, and reading. The assignments included 
questions calling for thought getting. The children were also 
asked to prepare questions calling for the thought in a certain 
paragraph or chapter which the members of the class were 
asked to answer.”
-P-A-G-E-134
  
126 How to Measure 
One of the teachers in this school points out the following 
advantage of this test: “Another valuable service which 
these tests rendered was in determining promotions. In the 
June promotions the mother of a little girl who took the test 
questioned her child’s promotion mark. When the mother 
was shown the rate which her child received on the reading 
test in comparison with the rating of other children and the 
answers to her questions on the different paragraphs, she 
was entirely reconciled to the justice of the teacher’s marks. 
The mother also learned facts about her child which were 
unknown to her before. The child’s answers to the ques- 
tions emphasized the fact that she frequently had flights 
of fancy which carried her far from the point in question.” 
The teacher of a 4-A grade in which the test was given in 
March and June 1918 reported that “a class score of 5.55 
was obtained in March and a class score of 6.11 in June. 
Some of the weaker pupils improved from 4 to 5.25 and in one 
case from 4 to 6.” The teacher further suggests that, “ If 
these tests were given during the first week of the term, the 
teacher would know in a general way how the class ranks and 
would also know the ability of each individual pupil in the 
understanding of sentences.” 
The Thorndike Scale Alpha 2 for Measuring the Under- 
standing of Sentences can easily be given by the teacher. To 
the child it means nothing more than a class exercise in which 
instructions are carefully given. It measures one of the most 
important results of a teacher’s efforts. For this reason it is 
strongly recommended to teachers in the teaching of reading. 
It is one of the best silent reading tests available. 
Courtis Strent Reapinc Test No. 2 
Aim. — The aim of the Courtis Silent Reading Test No. 2 
is to measure the rate and the amount of comprehension in 
silent reading.

The Measurement of Reading 127 
Description of Test. — This test is published in two editions, 
Form I, in which appears a story entitled ‘“‘ The Kitten Who 
Played May Queen,” and Form II, “ The Kitten Who Went 
to a Picnic.” Each story is of equal difficulty. The test is 
suitable for Grades 2 to 6 inclusive. Each test is divided into 
Part I and II. Part I measures the rate of reading. Part 
II measures the comprehension of reading. 
Giving the Test. —Instructions to the pupils are printed 
on each test. These instructions are simple and easily under- 
stood by the children. Each child is permitted to read for 
three minutes, at the expiration of which time a line is drawn 
around the last word that is read. This will determine the 
rate of each child’s reading. The child is then given five 
minutes in which to answer questions on what he has read. 
The number of questions answered correctly will determine 
the extent of his comprehension. 
Scoring the Results and Computing Class Scores. — The 
author has provided careful instructions for the giving and 
scoring of the tests and the recording of the results in Folders 
B and D, series R, which should be in the hands of each 
teacher. The children in grades 5 and 6 and usually grade 4 
can score one another’s papers. The papers of children 
in grades 2, 3, and backward 4th grade classes can be scored 
and recorded by the children of higher grades. Answer 
cards are provided for this purpose. 
“After the median rate of reading and the median number 
of questions correctly answered are determined, the index of 
comprehension, which is ‘‘the relation the difference between 
the right and wrong answers bears to the right answers, ” is 
estimated. The method of determining this index of com- 
prehension is thoroughly outlined on pages 2 to 5, Folder D. 
Each child’s scores are then tabulated on a class record 
sheet. Such a record sheet for a 6-B grade in a city 
school system which was tested in January, 1919, is shown 
on pages 128 and 129.

Interpreting and Using Results. —The preceding record is 
read as follows: The class is slightly below the standard for 
the grade in the rate of reading but considerably below the 
standards for the grade in number of questions answered and 
in the comprehension of thought. The rate of reading ranges 
from 100 words to 240 words in 3 minutes, a range which is ° 
entirely too great and which indicates a large number of slow 
readers and likewise a large number of poor readers. 
From this same record sheet (back) the scores are classified 
according to the number of questions answered and the index 
of comprehension. An analysis of this classification shows 
only two children with satisfactory rate and comprehension 
and an additional four children with satisfactory rate and 
poor comprehension, making a total of six children out of 
twenty-five with a satisfactory rate. The record shows also 
seven children with satisfactory comprehension and poor 
rate, and an additional twelve children with poor rate and 
poor comprehension, making a total of nineteen children un- 
satisfactory in the rate of reading. 
The standard scores for the Courtis Silent Reading Test 
No. 2 are as follows:

In order that all of the teachers in the above school could 
profit from the results of these tests, the following table, which 
compares the scores of each class with the respective grade 
standards, was prepared by the principal of the school and ex- 
plained in detail to the teachers in conferences called for this 
purpose.

    This table is read as follows: In the 4-B grade there were 
61 pupils. In this class as many pupils made a score above 
108 words per minute and 25 questions answered in 5 minutes 
as below these scores respectively. The index of com- 
prehension is 69. This grade is therefore below the standard 
in all three scores. 
If the class scores are compared with class standards it 
will be seen that the comprehension scores with the exception 
of the 4-B grade (Index of comprehension 69 Standard 89) 
are more regular and nearer the class standards than the class 
scores in the other two points. The teachers of this school 
report: ‘“‘ The school as a whole measured more nearly to 
standard in comprehension than in the other two items. 
It made the poorest record in the number of questions answered 
in five minutes. Not a single grade reached the standard. 
Three fifth grade classes and one sixth grade fell below the 
standard for the fourth grade.”

An analysis of the individual papers made by the teachers 
is presented in the following summary :

The outstanding fact in this summary is the 3.6% of children 
scoring above and 43.5% of the children scoring below the 
standards for all three points. 
A further analysis of the individual papers shows that 
“four pupils in the 5-A grade and four in the 4-B grade 
showed negative indices of comprehension. They wrote 
more incorrect than correct answers to the questions. They 
not only failed to get the correct meaning from what they 
read but obtained one absolutely opposed to the correct 
meaning. One of these pupils has been tested by the psy- 
chological examiner and found to be a normal child.” 
Remedial Measures.— The report from the teachers 
continues: ‘The poor showing in the number of questions 
answered and the almost uniformly better showing in com- 
prehension indicates a desire for accuracy even at the expense 
of speed. Probably it was necessary for the children to read 
each paragraph several times in order to answer the questions 
correctly.” % 
“Tt would seem that some time exercises in silent reading 
followed by a test for accuracy of comprehension might help 
to overcome this deficiency and I have recommended such 
exercises to the teachers to be used in the place of their 
regular reading lesson. Emphasis is being placed upon the 
time element.”
-P-A-G-E-141
    The Measurement of Reading 133, 
In carrying out the above plan the following devices were 
found helpful : 
1. “Expose a paragraph of reasonable difficulty on the 
board for a few seconds. Have the children read silently and 
then have them answer questions revealing their compre- 
hension of the content of the paragraph. 
2. Expose another paragraph of directions on the black- 
board for a few seconds and permit the children to follow 
them out as soon as they get the thought. 
3. Expose a word picture briefly and permit the children 
to draw what they get from the brief exposure. Emphasize 
the time factor in order to show children the relative rates of 
reading. 
4. Let a child begin to read at any point in the story. 
The child who discovers the place first will continue the 
reading.” 
ORAL READING 
School practice has in the past given an undue amount of 
attention to the training of children in oral reading. It is 
not unfair to say that a much larger proportion of the school 
time allotted to reading is given to oral reading than to silent 
reading and yet, when the child becomes an adult, he will have 
little opportunity to practice it. Oral reading to the adult is 
the incidental means of expression. It is the person gifted 
in expression who makes a great use of oral reading. Oral 
reading should receive proper attention in the classroom not 
only as a means to successful silent reading, but also for the 
use that will be made of it by all individuals occasionally 
and a few individuals widely. It should not, however, be 
taught at the sacrifice of silent reading. 
Gray’s ORAL READING TEST 
Aim. — The aim of Gray’s Oral Reading Test is to determine 
accurately the extent of the child’s mastery over the mechanics 
 
-P-A-G-E-142
  134 How to Measure 
of reading. This is shown by the rate of his reading and the 
accuracy with which he reads. The rate is determined by the 
number of seconds it takes to read a given paragraph. The 
accuracy is determined by the number of errors made in 
reading a paragraph. Six kinds of errors are noted, namely, 
complete mispronunciation, partial mispronunciation, — 
omissions, substitutions, insertions, and repetitions. 
Description of Test.— The test consists of twelve para- 
graphs intended for grades one to eight inclusive. Each 
paragraph increases in difficulty over the preceding one by 
equal steps which have been scientifically determined. 
Giving the Test. — Complete instructions for giving the 
tests are found on the back of the score sheet, which must be 
in the hands of each teacher using the test. These instructions 
should be rigidly followed. No teacher should attempt to 
examine her class before she has completely mastered the 
instructions for giving the tests and scoring the results,and 
until she has had some practice through the examination of 
two or three children. The tests can be given to only one 
child at a time and then not in the presence of the other 
children. There should be no interruptions. For this reason 
the test takes a much longer time for its application than is 
required for most tests. One teacher reports that it took 
her three hours and forty-five minutes to test a class of 
twenty-five children. This time was distributed over a 
number of days. The test was given after school, at noon 
periods and during the regular school hours in another room 
where there could be no interruptions. In the selection of an 
appropriate time for giving tests care should be taken to see 
that normal working conditions for the child prevail. This 
same teacher also reports that: “ The children loved this 
test. Ihave never seen them any happier than when they were 
reading it for me. They liked the easy paragraphs because 
they were easy and they thought it was great fun to try to 
pronounce the difficult words in the more difficult paragraphs.”
-P-A-G-E-143
  
The Measurement of Reading 135 
From the preceding quotation it is evident that the success 
with which the tests are used by a teacher depends upon the 
spirit with which she approaches her work and the accuracy 
with which she follows instructions. As the child reads 
from one copy of the test, the teacher follows on another 
copy and marks the errors as indicated on the author’s instruc- 
tion sheet. 
Scoring Results. — The instructions for scoring the results 
are simple. The time taken to read each paragraph can be 
recorded in seconds on the left-hand margin of the test sheet ; 
the number of errors made in reading each paragraph can be 
recorded on the right-hand margin of the test sheet. The 
score for each paragraph is determined from the number of 
seconds and the number of errors according to the following 
key provided by the author on the score sheet :

“The numbers in the left-hand column refer to the number of seconds 
required to read a paragraph. The numbers in the horizontal line at the 
top of the table refer to the number of errors made in reading. The 
numbers in the horizontal line to the right of 40 mean that if a paragraph 
is read in 4o or more seconds with no errors a credit of 4 is given; with 1 
error, a credit of 4; with 2 errors, a credit of 3; with 3 errors a credit of 
2; etc.” 
The following is an actual reproduction of a child’s mis- 
takes in reading paragraph IV and the teacher’s scorings:

were then happy. 
It took him 94 seconds to read this paragraph and he made 
five errors. By referring to the key, it will be seen that the 
score for reading a paragraph in 4o or more seconds with five 
errors is zero. Therefore, his score on paragraph IV is zero. 
His record on all of the paragraphs is as follows:

A record of 86 seconds with 3 errors entitled him according 
to the key to a score of 2 for paragraph III. The record of 
48 seconds with 4 errors entitled him to a score of 1 for para- 
graph II. The record of 36 seconds with 5 errors entitled 
him to a score of 1 for paragraph I. The teacher then entered 
his score for each paragraph opposite his name on the score 
sheet. 
Below is given the exact record and also pupil score for 
each pupil in a class of 25 children in a 2-A grade of a city 
school system which was tested with Gray’s Oral Reading 
Test.

In this table the initials of the children are given together   with the sex, age, and nationality. It is read as follows:

of four on paragraphs one to seven inclusive and a score of 
two on paragraph 8; A.N., a girl, seven years old, of Swedish 
descent made a score of four on paragraphs one to six inclusive 
and a score of two on paragraph seven, etc. 
After each individual’s paragraph score is determined the 
pupil’s score for the test is found as follows: Multiply the 
score on paragraph I by 55 if in grade 1, 35 if in grade 2, 
30 if in grade 3, 25 if in grade 4, 20 if in grade 5, 15 if in grade 
6, 10 if in grade 7, 5 if in grade 8. Multiply the scores on 
each of the other paragraphs by 5. The sum of these prod- 
ucts divided by four gives the score on the test. 
Since M. J. was in the 2-A grade, her score for paragraph 
L is multiplied by 35 and each of her scores on the other para- 
graphs by 5. The sum of these products divided by 4 will give 
67.5 according to the following process:

Process: Total product 270 divided by 4 equals 67.5 — score for M. J. 
The average class score is found in the same manner with 
the exception that the sum of the individual paragraph scores 
is used instead of the individual paragraph scores. Referring 
to Table 34 it will be seen that the sum of the scores on para- 
graph I for this class of 25 children is 83, for paragraph II
-P-A-G-E-147
  The Measurement of Reading 139 
84, for paragraph III 76, etc. Since the pupils who made 
scores are in the 2~A grade, the sum of their scores for para- 
graph I is multiplied by 35 and the sums for the scores for the 
other paragraphs are each multiplied by 5 according to the 
following process :

The average class score is secured by the following process:

Interpreting Results. — The value of a test of any kind 
lies in the use that is made of it. Consequently, it is of the 
greatest importance not only that the test be given accurately 
but also that the results be used widely. To this end it is 
necessary that teachers be able to interpret their results and 
know how to use them. 
One of the first problems for the teacher is to compare 
the results of her class with scores from classes in the same or 
other cities. Gray’s Oral Reading Scale has been used in a 
number of surveys which have given considerable data for - 
comparative purposes. The following table ' gives the teacher 
an opportunity to make such comparisons :

This table is read as follows: On Gray’s Oral Reading Test, 
the second grade pupils in Gary made an average score of 27; 
in 23 Illinois cities, 20; in Cleveland, 42; etc. 
Since the average score of the second grade class reported 
in Table 34 was 45.8, this class scored higher than Gray’s 
Standard and every city score except St. Louis. Such 
comparisons give the teacher information which enables her 
to base her practice on scientific facts rather than on opinion. 
The teacher of this class says in this connection: “I expected 
it to come out that way because I think this class as a whole 
is doing good work in oral reading. Some of the children 
are very unusual readers, and there are not so many poor 
readers.” The test in this class also reveals the fact that 
there are a few children who are very poor oral readers and 
the extent to which they are below the average for the class. 
It, therefore, becomes a means of dividing a class of students 
with reference to their ability. It is here that the test reveals 
its greatest value. While it is important to know just where 
a class stands with reference to average ability in a certain 
subject, it is far more important to know the attainment of 
each student in that particular subject. In this way prac- 
tice can be so regulated that it meets the needs of each in- 
dividual and does not result in failure to both teachers and 
students. It often happens that the teacher does not forma 
correct judgment of a child’s ability. This is illustrated in
-P-A-G-E-149
The Measurement of Reading I4I 
the case of E. N. (Table 34), about whom the teachermakes the 
following report: ‘‘ E—— made a high score in this test and 
I think the test was valuable for that reason in that it showed 
me how much E really cando. The children don’t look 
pleased in class when it is E ’s turn to read because she 
reads in such a monotonous way although I have worked very 
hard with her. One would never give E credit for being 
one of the best oral readers, but she has proved by, this test 
that she does know the words and the mechanics of reading.” 
Again the tests will determine accurately the best readers 
in the class. Concerning the five students (Table 34), who 
made the best scores the teacher reports: “ These are my best 
readers. The test proved this very accurately.” 
The report of the teacher also reveals the fact that too 
much care cannot be exercised in seeing that normal con- 
ditions surround the child when the test is taken. If the 
child is interrupted or if it is made to feel that undue im- 
portance is attached to the result, nervousness may greatly 
hinder a true statement of the child’s ability. In the case 
of C. O. (Table 34), who made a score of 16.25, the teacher 
reports : ‘ C——— made a poor score; . . . we all love to hear 
Cc read and I consider her a good oral reader. I think 
she seemed a little nervous for fear she wouldn’t do as well 
as the others and she made so many little mistakes, which 
brought her score down and which she seldom does in school.” 
The teacher also makes the same explanation for the low score 
of L.H. She says: “ made a poor score but he is one 
of the best oral readers in my room. He was so anxious to 
excel, and I think that made him nervous, for one would expect 
him to stand at the head instead of at the foot.” This shows 
the need to have the tests given under normal conditions. 
Using the Results. — Permanent progress resulting from the 
use of tests will depend upon the use that is made of them. 
Consequently, careful attention should be given to the follow- 
ing work:   
  
  
  
  
 
-P-A-G-E-150
  
142 How to Measure 
First, the test should be given at the beginning and at the 
end of the term so that time and energy of pupils and teachers 
are not wasted in finding out what children can and cannot do. 
Second, a graph of each individual score should be kept 
in a convenient place so that each child can see his standing 
in relation to his classmates. The following is a convenient 
graph to use in connection with class results :

z according to his oral reading ability.   
  
                                  
  
  
  
Third, the teacher should keep each child’s test sheet in 
order that his difficulties in the mastery of symbols in reading 
may be investigated. 
Fourth, the children in the class should be grouped into 
fast and slow groups according to their ability as revealed 
by the test. 
Fifth, the wide variability in the achievement of children 
in practically every class calls for serious consideration by 
the teacher in the way of readjustment of class groups, 
special promotions, etc. 
If many of these children (Table 34) are good in the other 
subjects of the grade they should be given an opportunity to 
advance to the work of the third grade. The question should 
be asked: Are not some of these children being held back for 
the slower children? Numerous cases are on record to show 
that when such children are given an opportunity to advance    
-P-A-G-E-151
    The Measurement of Reading 143 
to a higher grade, they are able to maintain the standard of the 
grade without much difficulty and advance with the class, much 
to the surprise of the teacher. 
HacceErty’s VisuAL VOCABULARY TEST 
Aim. — This test aims to determine the extent to which 
the children have acquired control of words. It is specially 
helpful to the teacher in the early stages of reading. 
Description of the Test.— The Haggerty Visual Vocab- 
ulary Test is arranged in two parts. The second part is 
treated later in the chapter. The first part is a test for 
grades one and two and is divided into series A and B. 
Each series consists of 30 sight words and 25 phonetic words 
arranged in lines. Each line bears a number. The words in 
series B are different from those in series A but are of the 
same degree of difficulty in order that a class may be tested 
a second time to determine the amount of progress during a 
certain period of time. These tests are printed in the follow- 
ing form:

  144 How to Measure 
Giving the Test.— The application of the test is simple 
so that it can easily become a helpful instrument in the hands 
of the teacher. The following instructions are sufficient to 
insure good results: 
1. Each pupil is to be tested alone. 
2. Hand the child the Pupil’s Card. 
3. Ask him to pronounce each word beginning at the top of 
the column. 
4. Do not help the child in any way. Do not correct mistakes 
or suggest ways of working out a word. Do not suggest that the 
child has seen the word before. Do not seem impatient if the 
child makes an error. Allow a reasonable time for each word, 
and if the child does not name the word correctly, ask him to try 
the next word. 
5. Whenever the pupil fails to speak the word correctly place 
on the Class Record Card a zero opposite the word and in the 
column allotted to that pupil. 
6. Record the age of each pupil to the nearest month, that is, 
6:5 for six years five months. 
7. Record boys by letter B; girls by letter G. 
Scoring Results. — When all the pupils of the class have 
been tested, total the number of zeros or errors on each line 
for the class and find the percentage this amount is of the 
total number of scores for each line. If fifteen children are 
taking the test there should be 75 scorings (15 X 5) on a line 
of five words. If 5 of these scorings are errors, the percentage 
of error would be 5 + 75 or 63.% In the same way each 
child’s percentage of errors is determined. 
“The highest numbered line which the child does with one 
(or no) omission or error is taken as his score.”’ 
The score for the class will be the number of the line which 
has 20% of errors. “If no single line gives exactly 20%, 
the actual class score will be intermediate between the two 
lines which give nearest 20% of error.” (See Form 9, series 
B, Author’s Directions for Giving and Scoring Tests in 
Reading. )

Interpreting the Results. — The teacher giving the Haggerty 
Visual Vocabulary Test should have no difficulty in interpret- 
ing the results of her test and in applying them to her practice 
in the classroom. The results are usually pronounced, due to 
the fact that the progress of children in the mastery of words 
is rapid if proper methods are employed. The results of the 
work of five teachers in the first and second grades of a city 
school system are reported in Table 36, which is read as follows : 
Thirty-five children in the 1-A grade of the Monroe School 
made a score of 37.3 in February and 44.9 in May on sight 
words, which is a growth of 7.6 points ; twenty-two children in 
the 2—B grade of the same school made a score of 50.7 in Feb- 
ruary and 76.2 in May, which is a growth of 25.5 points, etc.

The column of differences shows a wide variation in the 
amount of growth, which is due to the teaching, the mental 
condition of the class, changes, etc. The principal under 
whose supervision these tests were given reports: “ The 
least progress was made in the grades in each school where 
the teachers were changed during the semester. Their scores 
furnish a mathematical statement of the loss caused by such a 
change.” 
If the results of these tests as reported in Table 36 are 
represented in graph form, a better idea of the amount of 
growth in each class can be more readily secured.

in grades I and II of two schools from February to May, 1918. 
The graphs show that the classes have made approximately 
a half year’s progress. ‘The Monroe School occupies a slightly 
better position in May than it did in February. 
Using the Results. — The use which can be made of these 
tests and the extent to which they can affect classroom prac- 
tice is best told in the words of one of the teachers who gave 
the test. ‘ The fact that so many children failed to recognize 
such words as name, head, think, here, yes, shows that more 
drill should be given to words of that type.”’ “ An interesting 
 
-P-A-G-E-155
The Measurement of Reading 147 
feature of the test was the manner in which different pupils 
gave the words. ‘Those who were sure of the words gave them 
rapidly. Many knew the phonograms, but failed to enun- 
ciate them properly. Some who read well in their books 
failed to recognize the words because they were isolated.” 
“After studying the results I decided to adopt a more efficient 
method of teaching phonics. 
“ty, I reviewed carefully the basic facts of phonetics and made 
plans for a more complete course of phonetic instruction. 
“2, I determined to give more attention to individual instruc- 
tion in the mechanics of reading. The number of concert recita- 
‘tions was limited, and the classes were grouped according to 
weaknesses along important lines. I found that some children 
needed more drill on the basic phonograms, and others on proper 
enunciation. 
“3. At the suggestion of the primary supervisor a system of 
checking up daily the individual errors was tried out by means 
of the following chart :

“As each child pronounced the phonograms on the left side of 
the chart his record was marked in the column with his name at 
the top. If no errors were made, one hundred was placed under 
his name; if errors were made a check was placed opposite the 
phonogram.

  148 How to. Measure 
“Tn conclusion, the tests emphasize the importance of indi- 
vidual help in teaching phonics. It has brought to me very 
strongly the fact that individual help in all other subjects as 
well is equally important.” 
Corrective Measures. — Many reading recitations would 
be more profitable if they were preceded by a study period 
in which the children followed a definite assignment. Too 
often a class is hastily told to read seven pages or the next 
story and be able to tell what has been read, This is wholly 
inadequate, leading to a hurried and aimless sketching in 
which the child unconsciously omits or neglects the very 
things he should master and spends his time on the easy and 
entertaining parts because he has not been taught to analyze 
the difficulties. 
A definite assignment is necessary to insure a profitable 
study period. The nature of the subject matter and the 
status of the class determine the kind of assignment that will 
be most effective. 
The following methods have been found helpful : 
1. A word and phrase drill should precede the study 
period with emphasis on the time factor, — quick recognition 
is the important thing. Pupils may practice during the study 
period to reduce the time it requires them to recognize these 
lists. Group work may be done. 
2. Questions and directions on the board will lead to a 
study of thoughtful interpretations. For example, ‘In 
which speech is John angry?” “Is he slightly vexed or 
very angry?” “Show by your reading which you think he 
is.” 
3. A short enunciation drill may be assigned for study be- 
fore class. 
4. Individual assignments to correct individual difficulties 
may be given.

The Kansas Silent Reading Tests devised by Dr. F. J. 
Kelley 1 are made up of a graded list of paragraphs or exercises. 
These tests preceded and are not unlike the Monroe 
Standardized Silent Reading Tests. The Monroe Tests have 
incorporated those features of the Kansas Silent Reading Tests 
which have proved satisfactory. There are three tests: 
No. 1, for grades 3, 4, and 5; No. 2, for grades 6, 7, and 8; 
No. 3, for grades 9, 10,11, and 12. Each test is divided into 
two forms, which are different in subject matter, but equal in 
difficulty, so that the same grades can be measured at different 
times. The tests are intended to measure speed and compre- 
hension in silent reading. The scores on these two points are 
given in one mark. The score in speed and comprehension 
for each exercise is recorded on the left-hand margin of the 
test sheet. The child’s ability in silent reading is, therefore, 
the sum of the values of the exercises which he reads correctly 
in five minutes. 
These tests have been widely used so that standards are 
available. These standards are given in terms of the median 
and percentile scores as indicated below:

The Fordyce Scale for Measuring the Achievements in 
Reading, devised by Dr. Charles Fordyce,! is intended to 
measure the speed and quality (comprehension) of silent 
reading. The scale is divided into test No. 1, designed for 
grades 3, 4, and 5, and test No. 2, designed for grades 6, 7,

8,andg. The legend of “ Narcissus ” is the selection for test 
I and “ The Spirit of Spring” the selection for test II. The 
rate of reading is determined by the number of words read 
at the expiration of three minutes for Part I and five minutes 
for Part II. The extent of the pupils’ ability to understand 
is determined by answering certain questions on the entire 
selection for which ten minutes and fifteen minutes are given 
respectively for Tests I and IJ. In order that all the children 
may have the same information, they are given an opportunity 
to finish the part which they have not yet read. Below are

can give it to her class quickly and efficiently. 
It gives the reading ability of children in terms of speed and 
quality (comprehension). The score sheet is arranged so 
that the ability of each child can easily be seen. The scale 
becomes, therefore, an important instrument in the hands 
of the teacher to diagnose the needs of her class. It is receiving 
wide use throughout certain sections of the country.

Brown’s Silent Reading Tests, constructed by H. A. 
Brown,' are made up of easy reading selections to be used in 
grades 3 to 8. They are intended to measure speed and the 
quantity and quality of comprehension. After the children 
have read as much as they can in exactly one minute they 
are asked to write as much as they can remember of what 
they have read. A key is used to determine the quantity 
and the quality of what has been reproduced. In addition 
to the scores in speed and comprehension, the child’s ability 
is given in terms of one mark called “ reading efficiency,” 
which is obtained by multiplying the scores in speed and 
comprehension. The following are tentative scores so far 
available for the test:

The tests are useful in determining the reading ability of 
individual children on account of the fact that the different 
factors — speed, quantity, and quality of comprehension — 
which are necessary for good reading can be determined. 
The Haggerty Visual Vocabulary Tests by Dr. M. E. 
Haggerty are a “slight modification” of the Thorndike 
Visual Vocabulary Tests with the addition of an oral test 
(Part I) for grades I and II which is discussed under Oral 
Reading. 
Part IT is a list of words called “‘ Scale R” for grades III 
and IV and another list of words called “Scale R 2” for grades 
V, VI, VII, and VIII.

The Thorndike Reading Scale, Word Knowledge or Visual 
Vocabulary, by Dr. E. L. Thorndike is intended to deter- 
mine the extent of a child’s knowledge of words. 
The scale is divided into two divisions, Scale A—2 and Scale 
B. Each scale has two series, X and Y. Each series is made 
up of a graded list of words which increases from simple words 
familiar to almost any child with two or three years in school 
to less familiar words which school children seldom meet. 
The list of words for each series and for each scale is of 
equal degree of difficulty for the purpose of testing the same 
children more than once to determine the extent of progress. 
These tests are intended for grades III to VIII. 
Gray’s Silent Reading Test by Dr. Wm. S. Gray! is made 
up of the following selections for grades as indicated : 
Grades IT and IIT Tiny Tad 
Grades IV, V and VI The Grasshoppers 
Grades VII and VIII Ancient Ships 
The test is used to determine the rate and quality of 
pupils’ reading. Quality is “ based on the ability of pupils 
to reproduce what was read and to answer specific questions 
concerning the subject matter of the test.’’ Only one pupil 
is tested at a time. This test has recently received consider- 
able use in the St. Louis survey. On account of the large 
amount of time required to give this test, its use is limited in 
the hands of classroom teachers. The standard scores for 
this test are as follows:

Achievement Examination in Reading: Sigma 1 by Dr. 
M. E. Haggerty and Margaret E. Noonan is intended to 
measure the reading ability of children in grades I to III 
inclusive. It was devised in 1919 in connection with the 
Virginia school survey. In addition to its use in the state 
of Virginia, it has been used in St. Louis, Cincinnati, Madison, 
Bloomington, and Aberdeen. 
This reading test is in two divisions in one pamphlet, 
Test and Test 2. Test 2, which consists of a series of ques- 
tions to be answered by no or yes, as “ Can you eat? No— 
yes; Can a bat walk? No—Yes,” etc., should be given 
first. Test 1 consists of a series of performances, as “Put a 
tail on this pig.” (Picture of pig without tail given.) A 
Manual of Directions by Dr. M. E. Haggerty contains ex- 
plicit instructions for this test and also for Intelligence 
Examinations: Delta r and Delta 2. This manual should 
be in the hands of every teacher giving the test.

The authors of these tests have overcome the difficulties 
encountered in determining the reading ability of young 
children who are unable to follow complicated instructions or 
who have not acquired a wide vocabulary. The nature of 
the subject matter appeals to the interest of the children. 
The simplicity of the tests and the ease with which they can 
be given make them a valuable instrument in the hands of 
every primary teacher who wishes to know the achievement 
of her children in reading. 
The subject of reading has been receiving marked attention 
from psychologists and other educational experts during 
recent years. The importance of reading in every child’s 
development justifies this attention. This interest has resulted 
in sufficient scientific information in the form of standardized 
tests, scales, and standards of achievement which enable every 
classroom teacher to determine accurately the ability of her 
children in reading. Every teacher now in a classroom or 
coming fresh from the training school should be sufficiently 
familiar with a test or several tests so that she can justify 
her instruction in reading by scientific facts as well as by 
opinion.

  CHAPTER VI 
THE MEASUREMENT OF ENGLISH COMPOSITION 
Tue importance of written composition in the life of the 
pupil and the indefinite notions of teachers as to proper 
standards in written composition make the need for an 
objective measurement an exceedingly urgent one. The 
difficulty of securing such a measurement in written com- 
position over the measurement of such subjects as spelling, 
arithmetic, penmanship, is greatly increased by the large 
number of factors which make up written composition. 
There are the different kinds of written composition, as 
narration, description, exposition, and argumentation; there 
are also the factors of the content and such form elements 
as punctuation, spelling, capitalization, and sentence structure. 
All of these difficulties have hindered the construction of a 
scale for written composition which can be used with ease and 
accuracy by the classroom teacher in determining the ability 
of her children in this subject. 
The first scale for written composition was constructed by 
Dr. Milo B. Hillegas.! It measures general merit in written 
composition. It consists of 10 samples, 3 of which are arti- 
ficial, 5 were written by high school students, and 2 by college 
freshmen. The values of the different samples range from 
o to 9.3 with wide steps between samples. This scale has 
shown the need for a written composition scale and formed 
the basis for the construction of other scales which have a 
more direct application to particular grades of work or to local

situations. Examples of this procedure are found in the 
Nassau County Supplement to the Hillegas Scale for Measur- 
ing the Quality of English Composition, proposed by Dr. M. 
R. Trabue ‘ and the Extension of the Hillegas Scale for Measur- 
ing the Quality of English Composition of Young People by 
Dr. E. L. Thorndike." 
Tue Nassau County SUPPLEMENT TO THE HILLEGAS 
SCALE 
Aim. — The purpose of this scale is to determine the general 
merit of children’s written composition. No attempt has 
been made by the author to define the different elements in 
general merit. Hillegas in referring to his own scale which 
measures the same thing says, “‘ The term (merit) means just 
that quality which competent persons commonly consider as 
merit, and the scale measures just this quality.” 
Description of Tests. — For the purpose of giving the teacher 
a clearer understanding of the scale and its application, the 
entire scale is given below:

Next Saturday I should like to go away and have a good

the fields and planting corn, wheat, and oats and other things 
planted on farms. 
Next Saturday I will go to the Pioneer meeting if nothing 
happens so that I cannot go. I should like to go swimming 
but it is not warm enough and I would catch a bad cold. 
I should like to go to my aunts and drive the horses, I do 
not drive without some older person with me, so I cannot 
go very often. 
I should like to see my aunts cat and her kittens, too. I 
think I can, to.

I should like to join my girl friends, ‘who are going to the 
city on the 9-o5 a.m. train. They are going shopping in 
the morning and will have lunch to-gether, then they are 
going to the Hippodrome. After the Hippodrome, they 
are all going home to dinner to one of the girls houses, she 
lives on Riverside Drive so they expect to take the “Fifth 
Avenue Bus” up there. The evening will be devoted to 
playing games, singing and dancing.

If I had a thousand dollars to spend, I think I would take 
a trip to San Francisco by train with the rest of the family, 
and stop at a sea-side hotel. It would be glorious to see the 
surf again, and to escape from the cold blustering weather of 
December for the balmy breezes of the ocean, and the whiff 
of orange blossoms. 
We could take long drives under shady trees, visit the 
orange and olive groves and bathe in the surf. Think of 
bathing in the ocean in December. 
Coming home again I would enjoy stopping at Yellow 
Stone Park. It would be lots of fun to camp out, and to 
ride over the prairies on frisky ponies. It would be very 
interesting to notice the change of climate as we got farther 
east, and to go to bed on the train one evening feeling warm, 
and waking up the next morning feeling very chilly.

One Sunday, towards the end of my summer vacation, 
I was in bathing at the Parkway Baths. In the Brighton 
Beach Motor drome, a few rods away, an aviation meet was 
going on. Several times one of the droning machines had 
gone whirring by over our heads, so that when the buzzing 
exhaust of a flier was heard it did not cause very much com- 
ment. Soon, however, the white planes of “Tom” Sop- 
with’s Wright machine were seen glimmering above the 
grandstand. Everyone stood spellbound as he circled the 
tract several times and then headed out to sea. He was 
seen to have a passenger with him. Suddenly, the regular 
hum of his motor was broken by severe pops, and the engine 
ran slower, missing fire badly. In response, to Sopwith’s 
movements, the big flier tilted and swooped down to the 
beach from aloft like an eagle. The terrified crowd make 
a rush to get out of the way as the airship came on, but 
Sopwith could not land on the beach, but skimmed along 
close to the water instead. Suddenly his wing caught the 
water, and the big machine somersaulted and sank beneath 
the waves. The aviators soon came bobbing up and were 
taken away in a launch, but the accident will not soon be 
forgotten by those who saw it.

The courage of the panting fugitive was not gone; she 
was game to the tip of her high-bred ears; but the fearful 
pace at which she had just been going told on her. Her legs 
trembled, and her heart beat like a trip-hammer. She 
slowed her speed perforce, but still fled industriously up the 
right bank of the stream. When she had gone a couple of 
miles and the dogs were evidently gaining again, she crossed 
the broad, deep brook, climbed the steep left bank, and fled 
on in the direction of the Mt. Marcy trail. The fording of
-P-A-G-E-169
    The Measurement of English Composition 161 
the river threw the hounds off for a time; she knew by 
their uncertain yelping, up and down the opposite bank, 
that she had a little respite; she used it, however, to push on 
until the baying was faint in her ears, and then she dropped 
exhausted upon the ground. 
The first seven specimens were selected from compositions 
written by children in the elementary schools of Nassau 
County, New York, on the topic, “ What I Should Like to Do 
Next Saturday.” The last three were selected from a list of 
compositions published by Dr. E. L. Thorndike. The values 
range fromo tog. It is intended for grades 4 to 12 inclusive. 
The compositions are arranged on one sheet with the value of 
each composition printed on the left-hand margin. For the 
sake of clearness in this text the value of each paragraph is 
placed in the middle of the page and above the paragraph. 
Applying the Scale. — After a set of composition papers has 
been secured which has been a part of the regular class work 
or a special assignment on some topic which is familiar to the 
pupils as an Exciting Experience, An Accident, What I shall 
Do Next Saturday, etc., each paper is compared with the 
scale with a view of deciding on the specimen which its 
quality most closely resembles. The scale value of this 
composition is marked on the child’s composition. If a finer 
rating is desired than the values as given to each composition, 
units between each value may be used. For example if a 
composition is better than quality 3.8 and not as good as 
quality 5.0 a rating between these two qualities may be given 
as 4 or 4.5 according to the judgment of the teacher. 
Scoring the Results. — As soon as a rating has been given 
to each child’s composition the papers are grouped according 
to their values, from the lowest to the highest. The number 
of papers in each group is then determined and the results 
recorded on a record sheet similar to the following:

If a comparison is made of the scores reported on the class 
record sheet (Table 39) with the scores in Table 4r it will be 
seen that the written composition work in this school in the 
fourth grade is below all the scores, in the 5-B grade it is 
below all scores except two, in the 5—A grade it is exceeded 
by 5 out of to scores, and in the 6-B and 6-A grades it 
exceeds all scores. 
It is evident, therefore, that the written composition in 
the fourth grade is exceedingly low, in the fifth grade it is 
also low, but in the sixth grade it is ahead of the work in the 
places with which comparisons are possible. 
The unusually low scores in the fourth grade may be ex- 
plained partially by the large number of foreign children in 
this school. These scores are surely an indication that more 
systematic training in oral and written composition should be 
given in the fourth grade and also in the third grade. 
The scores in Table 42 were obtained from compositions 
which were written as a class exercise under the supervision of 
the classroom teacher. All of the children wrote on the same 
theme, “An Exciting Experience.’ Twenty-five minutes 
were allowed in which to do the work. The exercise was 
given one week before the end of the first semester. The 
purpose of the exercise was two-fold: first, to determine the 
attitude of the teacher towards the use of such a scale in 
rating composition papers as opposed to the regular method ; 
and second, to ascertain whether or not the scale in. con-
-P-A-G-E-173
  The Measurement of English Composition 165 
nection with such an exercise could be used to determine 
promotions. 
The teachers who gave the exercise and scored the papers 
were unfamiliar with the use of the scale. Carefully prepared 
instructions were given to each teacher. 
The results show that in general the composition work in 
these four schools in comparison with the standards is low. 
Judging from the comments of the teachers who gave the test 
and who were asked to give their opinion of its value, the 
constant use of such a scale would improve the composition 
work in these schools. 
The opinion of all the teachers was that “the scale is a 
quicker and more accurate method of grading themes.” An 
analysis of the teachers’ reports shows very clearly the lack 
of standards as to just what constitutes good written com- 
position work. The prevailing opinion was expressed in the 
words of one of the teachers: “If a standard for composition 
is established for each grade, it will be a helpful guide in 
carrying on the written work.” 
The use of such an exercise as a basis for determining 
promotions received general approval. The different judg- 
ments can be summarized in the words of one of the teachers 
who reported as follows: “ It seems a fairer and more accurate 
way of judging a child’s ability than the customary examina- 
tion.” 
Once teachers realize the necessity for more definite 
standards in such subjects as written composition and under- 
stand the use of such a scale as the Nassau County Supple- 
ment and the help derived therefrom, a more scientific 
procedure is assured. The principal of one of the schools in 
which the above results were secured reports as follows: 
“The results of our first use of the Nassau County Supplement 
to the Hillegas Composition Scale seem entirely favorable. 
“A few teachers were at first of the opinion that consider- 
able extra work was involved in the use of the scale. Lack of
-P-A-G-E-174
  166 How to Measure 
familiarity with it caused much more time to be taken with 
this work than would be necessary after further use. I think 
that the opinion was changed after the last papers were 
graded.” 
The Nassau County Supplement to the Hillegas Scale is, 
on account of its simplicity, one of the best written com- 
position scales so far available for use by teachers in the 
elementary schools. It enables them to grade their written 
compositions more accurately and with greater speed than 
the present system of marking. 
WILLING SCALE ror Mrasurinc WRITTEN CoMPosITION 
Aim. — The purpose of this scale is to measure the “ Story 
Value” and also the “ Form Value” of the written com- 
position of children in grades four to eight. 
Description and Application of the Scale. — The scale 
consists of 8 compositions ranging in value from 20 to go in 
steps ten units apart. “ They are all on the same topic, 
An Exciting Experience. The scale is made up of the material 
it attempts to measure.” By “ Story Value” is meant the 
degree of completeness with which the story in the composition 
is told; by “Form Value” is meant the “ number of mis- 
takes in spelling, punctuation, and syntax per hundred words.” 
Full instructions are provided for the use of the scale. 
According to the plan, a class exercise is given on some topic 
as An Exciting Experience, A Storm, An Accident, etc. 
Twenty-five minutes are allowed to write the exercise. These 
compositions are then used as a basis for determining the 
children’s ability in written composition by comparing each 
composition with the scale and giving it the value of the com- 
position on the scale which it most resembles. 
Scoring the Results. — The compositions are scored first 
for the value of the story and second for errors in grammar, 
spelling, punctuation, and capitalization. If a composition
-P-A-G-E-175
  The Measurement of English Composition 167 
scores high for the value of the story and low for its form value 
or vice versa, a score between these two values should be 
finally agreed upon. According to the author “ no paper is 
marked above 70 which does not have good story value and 
technical excellence, nor is a paper marked below 40 which 
does not lack both of these qualities.” 
Below is given a class record sheet showing the scores from 
a 6-B grade in a city school system in January, 1920.

value 70. 
Interpreting and Using the Results.— The following 
standard scores are available with which comparisons can 
be made:

By comparing the scores on the above record sheet (Table 
43) with the standards (Table 44), it is readily seen that there 
are two children who are very poor in both story value and 
form value. Possibly the teacher was acquainted with this 
fact, but just how much she could not tell unless such a test 
had been givenand standards of attainment for different grades 
provided. She knows now that one pupil does not exceed the 
fourth grade standards of the five Kansas cities and the other 
is below the fourth grade standard in form value and the fifth 
gradestandard instory value in the samecities. Shealso knows 
that her class as a whole is above the Denver standards for 
the eighth grade and below the sixth grade standard in story 
value and above the eighth grade standard in form value in 
the five Kansas cities. 
An analysis of the errors on the papers from this class will 
enable the teacher to know the forms which should continue 
to receive drill. She will also know that steps should be 
 
-P-A-G-E-177
  
The Measurement of English Composition 169 
taken to improve the children in grasping and expressing the 
story in such a written theme. 
The plan of judging the compositions first for the value of 
the story and second for errors in form enables the teacher to 
analyze the strength or weakness of her written composition 
work. This being accomplished, she is able better to stress 
those elements in which the class is weak and which are 
essential to good composition. 
In the scoring of compositions as to general merit, when 
errors are taken into consideration, it is possibly better to 
count only certain types of mistakes. The plan of counting 
mistakes in the Gary survey is suggestive. The following 
types of mistakes were observed : 
IN CAPITALIZATION 
1. “ Failure to begin a sentence with a capital letter. 
2. Failure to capitalize a proper noun. 
3. The capitalization of common nouns. 
IN PUNCTUATION 
1. Failure to place a period at the end of a sentence. 
2. Failure to place a question mark at the end of a question. 
3. Failure to inclose a direct quotation in quotation marks. 
IN SYNTAX 
1. The use of the wrong case form, as ‘ me and him went.’ 
2. The use of one word in place of another, as ‘it would of 
(have) been.’ 
3. Lack of agreement of noun and pronoun, as ‘ the pieces 
were about the size — and it break.’ 
4. Lack of agreement between subject and verb as ‘ they 
was.’ 
5. Use of the wrong tense form, as ‘ seen ’ for ‘ saw.’ 
6. Use of the double negative.
-P-A-G-E-178
  170 How to Measure 
4. Confusion of dependent and independent clauses, as 
. away, but worst thing was that there were not light 
on the streets and no road but a little path through the wood 
but I dressed up and took my dog and started off we were not 
far from home when my dog his name was Rover began to 
chase after I was a fright to go myself and began. . . .” 
8. Omission of words essential to the thought, or the 
addition of irrelevant words, as ‘began to chase after (a 
rabbit, omitted) I was a fright to go myself.’ ” 
In addition to the diagnosis of the language abilities of her 
class and a comparison of the results with standards of 
attainment in other cities, the teacher should also be able to 
compare her class with other classes in the same school or in 
other schools of the same city; the supervisor should likewise 
be able to know the weak and strong spots in her organization. 
The following table shows the median class scores for 
written composition in grades 5 and 6 in three city schools 
in January, 1920, according to the Willing Composition Scale. ‘

  This table is read as follows: School number one made in 
story value 70 in 5—B, 81 in 5~A, etc., and in form value, 14.2 
in 5—-B, 8 ins5—A, etc. The scores for the 6—B grade in school 
number three are also shown on the class record sheet on 
Table 43. 
A comparison of these results with the standards so far
-P-A-G-E-179
    The Measurement of English Composition I7T 
available shows that in story value school number one stands 
well; in form value it is above the Denver and below the 
Kansas Standards. An outstanding fact in this school is 
that the 6—A grade shows more form errors than the 5—A or 
6-B grades, a clear indication of the need for more drill on 
form. School number three is above school number one and 
the other standards in both story and form values except 
in story value for the 6-B grade. School number two is 
below the other two schools and the Kansas cities in story 
and form values; it compares fairly well with the Denver 
standards in story and form values. 
Although the differences in scores may be due partly to 
the scoring of the teachers who were limited in their expe- 
rience in using the scale, it is evident that the written com- 
position work in school number two is weak. More system- 
atic instruction should be given in training these children 
to organize their experiences in outline form and to express 
their ideas orally before undertaking the written work. If 
this preparatory instruction is given before the children are 
permitted to write, the written compositions will show marked 
improvement in the content. Drill exercises on the mistakes 
in punctuation, spelling and syntax should follow the written 
themes. 
The teachers who gave the composition exercise and scored 
the papers to secure the results in the above table were pro- 
vided with all the instructions which accompany the Willing 
Composition Scale. All of the children wrote on the same 
theme, “An Exciting Experience.’ They were allowed 
twenty-five minutes to do the work, which was done as a 
class exercise. 
All of the teachers reported that “it was easily given.” 
Many of them stated that the papers were difficult to score 
with the scale on account of the lack of variety in com- 
positions comprising the scale. They agreed that the scale 
in connection with such an exercise was a fairer method of 
 
-P-A-G-E-180
  172 How to. Measure 
determining promotion on written composition than the cus- 
tomary examination. 
The two outstanding facts as reported by these teachers 
are the following: first, the scale applied to such an exercise 
is a good test of the mechanics and the story value of written 
composition ; and second, the value given to each composition 
on the scale for spelling, syntax, and punctuation is exceedingly 
helpful in directing attention to definite strength and weak- 
ness. 
The Willing Scale for Measuring Written Composition can 
be used by the teacher with advantage to determine the 
ability of her children in written composition. By analyzing 
the written composition work into its “ rhetorical and formal 
qualities,” instruction can be more carefully directed so 
that more satisfactory progress is assured. 
Tue TEAcHER’s Composition SCALE 
Probably the greatest good which a group of city teachers 
can derive from the use of a written composition scale will 
come from a scale of their own construction out of the material 
which they intend to measure. For such a purpose, it is rec- 
ommended that the Nassau County Supplement be used 
as a basis, although the teachers may find it helpful to make 
comparison with other scales. 
A simple plan for doing this was followed in the con- 
struction of the Gary Composition Scale. Compositions 
were selected and arranged into a scale by matching them with 
the specimens in the Hillegas scale. The values of the different 
compositions in the Hillegas Scale were then given to the 
corresponding compositions selected from the material to be 
measured. 
For the purpose of indicating to teachers the nature of 
such a scale, the complete Gary Composition Scale is 
given:

An Exciting Experience 
One day it was very hot and we didn’t know what to do. 
This was at our Gym. period, so we went over on the lawn and 
sat under a tree for a while in the shade. 
After a while one of the girls said, Let’s play something.” We 
all suggested that we would play ghost. We started and played 
for a long while and then we got tired and we sugested we would 
play something else so we played leap frog. 
We were awfully hot now so we sat down in the shade and 
rested ourselves. 
After a while one of the girls sugested that we would play 
statue. We had been playing awhile and it was my turn to be be 
swung around. The girl that was swinging had swung all the 
other girls and they were pretty heavy then she took me and 
swung me around fast not thinking of how light I was she let me 
go and I fell on my left wrist. I heard it crack and I thought it 
was broke, they took me down in the Gym and the Gym teacher 
bandaged it up. It was not broke, but it was sprained.

An Accident 
We were out at camp No. 133 which is sittuated near the banks 
of Deep River. One of the men that stayed at this camp owned 
a old duck boat which leaked and if you wanted to ride in it you 
would have to set a certain way ot it would fill with water and 
soon sink. 
My brother saw me paddaling around in it and he decided that 
he would do it himself. 
He weighed about twenty-five Ibs. more than me I told him 
the way to set in it but he would not listen but said that one end 
was as good as the other. 
He jumped in and sat down on the nearest end which was 
the wrong end and paddaled out into the river. He paddaled down 
the river for some distance and then turned around to come back. 
By this time the boat was nearly sinking and we saw him paddeling 
as fast as he could go to get back to the bank. 
But it was of no use the boat began to sink and he tried to get 
‘to the right end but in trying to get to the right end he upset the 
boat and had to swim with all of his clothes on. The water wasn’t 
very cold and he swam all the way to up the bridge pushing the 
boat with him. He soon was in dry clothes and was none the 
worse for the accident.

On the Water 
_ While at a small lake not far from Gary my small brother had 
quite an exciting adventure. The lake is quite deep and though 
my brother can row a boat quite well we never allowed him to go 
out in a boat by himself. 
One day my brother asked mother if he might go down to the

beach. She replied, ‘“‘ Yes, but do not get into the boats.” Clouds 
began to gather and it looked as though we would have a violent 
electric storm. | 
It began to get dark and mother thought of Bud so she sent 
my sister to get him. After a few minutes she came back saying 
that Bud was not on the beach. 
We asked if any one had seen him but no one had. I thought 
that he might be playing with one of the little boys so I went to a 
house on the bluff expecting to find him there. 
While I was on the porch, which over looks the lake, it began to 
thunder & lighten & soon the rain came down in torrents. I stood 
looking out over the lake & and I noticed a boat sway at the other 
side of the lake. 
I ran to my father and told him what I had seen. He hurried 
to the beach & found that one of the boats was missing. Then he 
and my sister took a boat and in about twenty minutes they came 
back with a rather frightened & very much bedraggled little boy. 
He, my brother, showed great presence of mind, for when the 
storm began he was not frightened very much and tried to reach 
the shore. 
You may be sure that he did not dare to go out in a boat alone 
after that. He told us that he would learn to swim first.

We came on a train late at night and had a hard time finding 
an American hotel in San Louis Potesi. After finding one we went 
straight to bed, although my mother took plenty of time to lock 
and prop the door closed. The next morning I woke up early and 
looked out of the window. The first thing I saw was a rickity 
old closed up wagon coming down the street drawn by a few very 
small borros. This strange looking object was the morning street-

the people to get out of the way. 
Some of the Peons were getting breakfast, the mother sat on the 
street baking tortellias and the family seated in a circle about her

people eating was that the pigs and dogs ran about the outside 
of the circle eating the scraps that were thrown them. 
Down the street comes a man riding on so small a borro that 
his feet touch the ground, he is smoking a cigerette and lazily 
looking about. Behind him walks his wife holding the baby and 
hiting the borro her husband rides on to make it go Behind the 
wife come the chi'dren each carrying something. The houses 
along the street are made of adobe, all the windows have bars on

With a jar and a somewhat business like jolt the rickty 
elevator came to a stop on the basement floor. The door 
swung open and I stepped out into press-room of the Chicago 
Tribune. 
Surrounded by a mass of quivvering steel I was at a loss to know 
what to do. I was suddenly confronted by a bearded man clothed 
in ink smeared overall and jumper. A small tight shop cap was 
set jauntily on one side of his head and a pair of steel grey eyes 
peered at me thru a rather large pair silver rimmed glasses. He 
seemed to be saying something to me but the battery of Hoe 
presses had control of the field and it was only with the greatest 
difficulty that I could hear what he was trying to tell me. 
Beckoning me with an ink stained finger the pressman, for 
such was the position of this man, piloted me around, under, and 
even over masses of quivering and roaring steel until we stopped 
before a press which stood two and one half stories high, a half 
city block in length and the same in width. The silent pressman 
paused for a moment to glance with pride at the roaring monsters 
when he motioned me again and mounting an iron stairway with a 
brass railing we were soon standing on the top deck of this master 
press. Two anda half stories below me sixteen large rolls of spot-

The value to teachers in having their own scale even though 
it be roughly determined is as follows: First, they have a 
double check on their results by the use of the two scales; 
second, a composition scale constructed from the material 
which is to be measured is of more value for purposes of com- 
parison; third, in the construction of such a composition 
scale, the teachers acquire a viewpoint and an intimate ac- 
quaintance with the measurement of written composition 
which they would not otherwise obtain. 
Other Tests. — The Extension of the Hillegas Scale for the 
Measurement of Quality in English Composition by Young 
People, by Dr. E. L. Thorndike, is a general merit scale in- 
tended to be used in grades 4 to 12 inclusive. It is made 
up of 29 compositions grouped according to their quality 
into 15 units with values ranging from o to 95. 
Some of the qualities have under them as many as 5 and 6 
specimens. On account of the larger number of compositions 
and a system of marking similar to that which teachers 
ordinarily use, the scale can be used to a considerable 
advantage by the teacher. 
The Harvard-Newton Scales for the Measurement of English 
Composition are made up of four scales for eighth grade com- 
position, one for each of the four types of composition, 
narration, description, exposition, and argumentation. The 
scales were constructed by Dr. Frank W. Ballou with the aid 
of eighth grade teachers in Boston. The compositions were 
written by eighth grade students. Each scale is made up of 
six compositions with values ranging roughly from 40% to 
95%. An important feature of each scale is a notation of the 
merits and the defects of each composition and a comparison 
with the compositions above and below it. 
A Scale for Measuring the General Merit of English Com- 
position, by F. S. Breed and F. W. Frostic was constructed

A Punctuation Scale has been constructed by Dr. Daniel 
Starch for the purpose of determining a child’s ability to 
punctuate. It is made up of a number of sentences arranged 
in a series of 10 steps which the child is to punctuate. These 
sentences increase in difficulty with each step. Tentative 
standards of attainment have been formulated for the seventh 
and eighth grades. 
A Copying Test was used by a group of Boston teachers to 
determine the degree of accuracy with which pupils copy. It 
is intended primarily for the grammar grades and the high 
school. Such errors are noted as occur in the following: 
Spelling, capitalization, omitted words, and added words.

  CHAPTER VII 
THE MEASUREMENT OF DRAWING 
How is Drawing Now Measured? — To the teacher of 
artistic temperament who objects that accurate grading of 
work in drawing is impossible, that much work is dependent 
upon sentiment, is intangible, and should be left unmeasured 
so far as the pupil is concerned, the answer is that measure- 
ment in drawing is constantly being made through “ grades ”” 
or “marks” which are given to children. Grades ranging 
from 100% down to 60% or from A to F are given year after 
year, term after term, and in some school systems month 
after month. The effort, therefore, to construct a scale that 
will make possible more accurate measurement of drawing 
should be welcomed by every teacher of drawing. Notwith- 
standing millions of measurements or marks each year, there 
are few teachers who themselves have any adequate standard 
for. grading which recognizes definite differences in ability 
between the pupils of one grade and another, or which makes 
possible any accurate comparison of the drawing work among 
buildings. The old marking or grading system has given us 
no accurate method for measuring products in drawing. 
Pupils themselves protest again and again against grades 
received that are based upon the mere whim of the teacher. 
Or perchance the teacher was out late the night before, or 
had a slight case of indigestion, and the pupil’s grades are cut 
accordingly. This is but another case of a badly felt need 
for objective standards in grading. 
The Scale and Some Uses of It. — In 1913, Dr. E. L. Thorn- 
dike constructed a tentative scale for the measurement ‘of 
181 
  EES OTR ye Co ee on eee
-P-A-G-E-190
  182 How to Measure 
general merit in drawing. The use of such a scale in the 
schoolroom is not only advantageous to the teacher, super- 
visor, and superintendent, but it is appreciated by the pupil 
as an instrument of fairness and democracy. With a definite 
scale available for comparisons, pupils themselves wl arrive, 
after some practice, at reasonable accuracy in judgment and 
they will be able to see clearly their own progress from a 
lower to a higher stage of ability. Dr. Thorndike’s scale, 
while tentative and while making no claim for perfection, 
does quite surely make possible the comparison of a pupil’s 
work at one time with his work at another time. It permits 
comparison with reasonable accuracy between the work of 
one pupil and another pupil or between one room or group 
of children and another. It permits comparison of work in 
one city with the work in another city. It enables supervisors 
or superintendents to determine the relative results from one 
hundred minutes per week in one part of the city over against 
fifty minutes per week in another part of the city and so 
makes it possible to determine the time allotment for drawing 
on a reasonably intelligent basis. It should permit also 
comparison of one method of instruction with another when 
conditions are properly arranged and conclusions properly 
evaluated. None of these results were possible except in a 
very: general and indefinite way under the old marking 
system. Under the old system if one hundred pupils in an 
entire city had a grade of 95% or above, and if such pupils were 
scattered in as many different rooms of the city, no one 
could infer that these one hundred pupils had the same ability 
or proficiency in drawing. On the other hand if as many as 
four pupils in the sixth grade of a large city system reached a 
proficiency equal to merit 17 of the Thorndike scale there 
would be little doubt on the part of any one familiar with the 
system that these pupils were fairly equal in ability and that 
they showed ability very much above the average. In fact 
merit 17 is such a degree of excellence as would be reached

by only one pupil out of 50,000, ages 6 to 15, and to discover 
a few pupils in a large city system who had superior ability 
can readily be recognized as information of unusual value. 
Requirements of a Scale. — A scale in drawing as in any 
other subject should permit accurate measurement of differ- 
ences in degree of merit. To weigh out sugar in five, ten, or 
fifteen-pound packages is comparatively simple as the method 
of weighing has been perfected to a very high degree. No such 
degree of accuracy should be expected from the use of the 
drawing scale. The samples of merit on the scale as arranged 
cannot be handled in the same definite and accurate manner 
as the pound weight which the grocer places upon the left- 
hand side of the scale to balance a pound of gugar placed on 
the right-hand side, but a little practice will enable the 
teacher to rank drawings with a fair degree of accuracy. 
This is the proper function of a scale. As the teacher 
becomes more familiar with the scale, and increases her 
experience in its use she will acquire more and more the 
weight-accuracy secured in handling sugar, but it is reason- 
able to expect that she will never quite reach sugar-weighing 
accuracy. 
An explanation of the unit of the Thorndike scale for draw- 
ing will make clear that absolute accuracy is hardly to be 
expected. The formation of the scale is built upon the basis 
of equal differences in judgment and the unit chosen for this 
particular scale is: the difference of merit in children’s drawings 
which 75% of artists, teachers of art, and intelligent judges 
generally can distinguish, and which 25% of them fail to dis- 
tinguish. It will be observed that the unit itself allows for 
25% error in judgment by those who are competent to judge. 
If the teacher makes mistakes in equal ratio, one in every 
four, the teacher still improves her judging by the use of the 
scale. It should be noted, however, that the units in the 
Thorndike scale are sufficiently large that the error in placing 
a drawing is seldom as great as a full step and that the usual
-P-A-G-E-194
  184 How to Measure 
variation of a judge does not exceed half a merit. Dr. 
Thorndike has explained this point as follows: ‘ If the same 
judge should so rate a thousand drawings, and then, putting 
these ratings aside, rate the thousand over again he would 
vary often by more than half a ‘merit’ from his previous 
judgments.”’ This means that for a high degree of accuracy 
a teacher should rate drawings several times and then take 
the average, or in a contest of unusual importance, the draw- 
ing should be rated by several judges and the average of 
the judgments taken. The necessity of a large number of 
rankings is greatly reduced by the use of a drawing scale. 
This was demonstrated by an actual test. Ten teachers 
measured the merit of a drawing by the use of the scale and 
varied only 4 points all told. Ten other teachers measured 
the merit of the same drawing without the scale. They 
were instructed to grade the drawings from o to 17. They 
showed a variation of 14 points, or nearly 4 times as much 
variation without the scale as with it. 
How the Scale was Derived. — The scale as derived by Dr. 
Thorndike is based upon a preliminary study of 45 drawings 
and a more intensive study of 15 drawings. The 15 drawings 
were submitted to 376 judges, 60 of them being artists of 
sufficient distinction to be listed in ‘‘ Who’s Who in America,” 
80 being supervisors or teachers of art, and 236 being students 
of education and psychology. The judges were asked to 
rank the 15 drawings according to merit. These 376 judg- 
ments of merit permitted Dr. Thorndike to determine the 
scale steps on the basis of differences in judgment of merit. 
The table which follows herewith summarizes the judgments 
with reference to the relative merits of the 14 drawings finally 
used in the scale. 
With this table as a basis and with a unit defined as the 
difference of merit recognized by 75% of the judges, Dr. 
Thorndike was able by the use of statistical methods to 
assign a definite value to each of the 14 drawings of the scale.

It is scarcely to be assumed that a unit in one part of the 
scale is exactly equal to a unit in another part of the scale. 
It is, however, safe to assume that the scale is entirely on a 
ranking basis, that is, that the drawings are arranged in the 
order of merit. It is also safe to assume that the units are 
approximately the same in one part of the scale as in another 
and that progress of one unit in any part of the scale is 
approximately equal to similar progress in another part of 
the scale. Dr. Thorndike gives warning, however, that the 
exact numeral relations of the scale should not be used too 
freely in scientific quantitative studies of achievement and 
improvement in drawing. For the practical purposes of 
measuring drawing work in the public schools, however, no 
harm will result from taking the scale at its face value. 
While it is unnecessary to attempt to understand in detail 
Dr. Thorndike’s method of determining the values of the 
drawings in the scale, an idea of the procedure may be easily 
grasped by considering the extremes of the situation.!, If 
drawing « were judged as better than drawing y by 
exactly 50% of a large group of competent judges, it is 
1 Students interested in fully understanding the procedure are referred to 
Thorndike’s “Mental and Social Measurements,” Chap. VIII. 
 
-P-A-G-E-196
  186 How to Measure 
apparent that just as many judges thought « better than 
y as thought y better than x. If the judges were suf- 
ficiently competent and numerous, we are justified under 
the conditions in assuming that drawings x and y are 
equal in merit. On the other hand if 100% of a large 
group of competent judges ranked drawing y as better 
than x we would only know that y was “ vastly superior ” 
or “so superior as to be in an entirely different class.” 
Now, manifestly, there are all grades of difference rang- - 
ing from a 50-so judgment of equality to a o-100 judg- 
ment of superiority, and some place in between these two 
would be found the degree of superiority that is recognized 
by only 75% of the judges. This is the unit of merit of the 
Thorndike Drawing Scale. By calling the first drawing 
(drawing a) in the scale zero, and remembering from the table 
above that 94.85% of the judges rated drawing b better 
than drawing a, the mathematics of the case gives 2.4 as the 
merit value of 6. In like manner the other values of the 
scale were determined, — 3.9, 5.7, 6.5, 7-8, 8.6, 10.5, 11.8, 
12.6, 13.5, 14.4, 16.0, and 17.0. The last two steps in the 
scale are almost exactly 1 merit apart, as 7 was judged better 
than m by 74.2% of the judges. So if m has a value of 16.0, 
n should have the value 17.0. It thus appears that such an 
intangible situation as differences in judgment may be made 
the basis of mathematical calculation for the formation of a 
definitely evaluated scale. 
Limitations of the Scale.— The chief limitation of the 
scale is that it is based upon general merit in drawing and is, 
therefore, not analytical of different types of drawing. In 
fact the scale combines various types of drawing into a single 
scale and thus relates to comparisons of materials that in 
many respects are not comparable. In time we should have 
scales developed that will deal with merit in particular lines 
rather than general merit. For instance the following possible 
unit scales will be recognized by a teacher of art and drawing:  
-P-A-G-E-197
The Measurement of Drawing 187 
. Pencil drawings. 
. Charcoal work. 
. Sepia originals. 
. Sepia reproductions. 
. Water color. 
- Mechanical drawings. 
. Maps and informational designs. aronarye 
The teacher may even make divisions along entirely different 
lines, resulting in such divisions as decorative, photographic, 
informational, representative, etc.; or even along such simple 
lines as types of subjects, as, trees, buildings, fruit, animals, etc. 
The type of art work carried on in different cities varies 
considerably. The supervisor of art and drawing will doubt- 
less find it especially helpful to use the Thorndike drawing 
scale for grading her work until she can supplement it by 
other scales, made by ranking and evaluating the work of her 
own pupils. Scales resulting in this way will be more easily 
understood by grade teachers and pupils, and they will also 
be more fully appreciated. The most useful scale for lower 
grade work will doubtless be a scale of merit for products in 
water color. Comparison with the Thorndike drawing 
scale will be the easiest and simplest method of procedure in 
making such a scale. At first the supervisor may have diffi- 
culty in filling in all of the steps on the scale. It may take 
the larger part of a year to complete this scale and others 
needed to cover the various phases of art work undertaken in 
the particular city, but all the while she will be collecting 
samples, comparing, rejecting, replacing, and getting her own 
ideas more and more definite. The result will be that by the 
time such scales are completed their value will be apparent 
and their usefulness unquestioned. Scales thus made up 
from the work of the pupils in a school system will be more 
useful in many respects and will accomplish some purposes 
not possible with the Thorndike scale, even though they are
-P-A-G-E-198
    
188 How to Measure 
much less accurate and not at all scientifically constructed. 
They will result in constant reference to the Thorndike scale 
and in a much better understanding of it. 
With reference to the extension and refinement of his own 
drawing scale, Dr. Thorndike makes the following comment : 
“ These limitations can be remedied in part, though we may 
not expect to measure the merit of a child’s drawing as easily 
and accurately as the weight of his body. The scale can be 
extended in scope to include specimens of maps, mechanical 
drawings, decorative drawings and designs of various sorts, 
drawings of specified objects, and the like; and with proper 
methods of investigation and enough labor, specimens can be 
found of these several sorts of drawings of exactly x ‘ merit,’ 
14 ‘merits,’ 2 ‘ merits,’ and so on up to 17 ‘ merits,’ which 
is as far as a scale for children’s drawings needs to extend. 
The labor involved is, however, very, very great. In order 
to get one specimen proved to be between .g9 and 1.01, it 
would probably be necessary to collect with great care at 
least fifty drawings by very stupid children, to have them 
measured by at least 100 judges in comparison with the scale 
as it now is, then to select 20 of them to be so measured by 
200 more judges, and then to select ten of these to be measured 
by 300 more judges, and finally to have the two or three or 
four of these that were between .99 and 1.o1, by the opinion 
of the 600 judgments so far, measured by 4oo more judges. 
If the present scale were not at hand as a basis, the labor would 
be much greater. The improvement of the scale in these 
respects must then be a gradual achievement of several 
years.” 
Grade Standards.— The fixing of grade standards in 
drawing or the various phases of art work will gradually 
follow an extensive use of scales with definitely evaluated 
units. The first step in fixing grade standards will be to 
agree upon a set of rules or instructions for taking samples of 
the work of pupils. These instructions will doubtless need
-P-A-G-E-199
  
The Measurement of Drawing 189 
to indicate a range of subjects or problems within the ability 
of the various grades tested and then fix time limits for the 
tests. However, this is only a guess as to how the instructions 
should be drawn. It may be that there should be no time 
limit, or that the best work of a pupil for a month or a term 
should be taken for grading. The art supervisor who works 
out satisfactory instructions and fixes grade standards will 
be performing a worth while educational service. 
Childs reports’ a preliminary use of the Thorndike scale 
during the winter of 1914. A total of 2177 pupils in two 
school systems was involved in the test. For the purposes 
of the test, a new scale was constructed by including all the 
human figure samples of the original Thorndike scale, and 
adding snow scene samples, thus making a scale with a total 
of 16 human figure and snow scene samples. In administer- 
ing the test, a time limit of ten minutes was observed and the 
subject was assigned as follows: “ Scene or picture with snow 
on the ground and boys or girls doing something, as snow- 
balling, coasting,” etc. 
The following median scores resulted from the test :

Childs thinks that the above medians should not be taken

this study, would be by gradé groups as follows:

This study, while brief and preliminary in nature, confirms 
Dr. Thorndike’s suggestion that differentiated scales are 
desirable. The ‘“ human figure, snow scene scale” used in 
this study was much more satisfactory than the Thorndike 
general scale. The study also confirms the findings of Barnes, 
Ludens, Burk, and Gotze, that children show a plateau of 
non-development in drawing from the age of nine or ten on to 
adolescence. It leads, therefore, to the question as to whether 
the time schedule in drawing should not be greatly reduced 
for most children from ages 10 to 14. There is little doubt 
but that extensive use of objective standards for grading 
products in drawing would do for that subject what it has 
done for other subjects. It would lead to a better selection 
of subject matter, improved methods of instruction, a revision 
of time schedules, and provision for handling children accord- 
ing to capacity and needs. 
Using the Thorndike Scale. — The drawing scale is used in 
the same manner as the writing scale. The specimen of the 
‘ pupil’s work is moved back and forth on the scale until the 
scale specimen to which it corresponds most nearly in general 
merit is found. This gives the value of the pupil’s work in 
terms of the scale, and the scale value should be placed as 
the “ grade” on the pupil’s work, if a “ grade”’ is desired. 
For example, if the pupil’s drawing corresponds in general 
merit to the sixth specimen on the scale, merit 7.8, then the 
pupil’s grade is 7.8.
-P-A-G-E-201
  The Measurement of Drawing Igt 
When first beginning the use of the scale there will be a 
tendency to place the sample on the scale according to the 
kind of drawing, rather than general merit. This is a diffi- 
culty which is soon overcome by practice in the use of the 
drawing scale just as it is in the use of the writing scale. The 
scale is constructed on the basis of general merit, and the 
specimen is to be located on the scale on the basis of general 
merit regardless of the kind of drawing. Pupils have diffi- 
culty on this point when the scale is first used, but it is sur- 
prising how quickly pupils as well as teachers advance to the 
stage of recognizing general merit in the use of the scale.

  CHAPTER VIII 
THE MEASUREMENT OF OTHER GRADE SUBJECTS 
Tue tool subjects of the grades are being measured with 
success and with beneficial results on teaching and curricula 
making. Can the content subjects — such as history, geog- 
raphy, physiology, literature, nature study, and elementary 
science — be measured with equal success and equally bene- 
ficial results? The answer is that many attempts are being 
made, that success has not been attained, and that final 
success is still in doubt. A scientific test or scale for grading 
a subject is merely a reasonable examination which has been 
carefully graded and evaluated, i.e. standardized. Any fixed 
or rigid examination scheme tends always to formalize the 
teaching of a subject. For the formal phases of the tool 
subjects this is desirable, assuming good teachers and provision 
for adequate motive. But can we formalize the teaching of a 
content subject without undesirable results, or can we apply 
standard tests to the more formal informational phases of 
such a subject without its resulting in misplaced emphasis by 
many teachers, a large majority of them? It is very doubtful. 
At any rate, it remains an open question. 
Standardized tests! have been devised in United States 
history, geography, language, and grammar. 
History. — At least seven standardized tests are available 
in United States history. Five of these test information 
only; namely, those by Bell and McCullum, Harlan, Starch, 
Davis, and Raynor. One test, by Van Wagenen, is devised

available tests.

The Measurement of Other Grade Subjects 193 
to test thought and character-judgment as well as information. 
Barr is working on a set of diagnostic tests in United States 
history, covering information, thought, reasoning, and judg- 
ment. The form of the history test varies. Harlan, Starch, 
and Raynor use the completion test form. Every test has 
made an effort to make the questions simple and definite so 
as to secure answers that can be graded as either right or 
wrong, thus simplifying and standardizing the grading. In 
the tests dealing with thought, reasoning, or judgment, this 
can be done to a limited extent only. 
The Bell and McCullum test is one of the first devised for 
testing history and is a good illustration of the informational 
type. It was first made available in 1917, but apparently it 
has not been extensively used. The test consists of seven 
parts, as follows: 
I. Give the reason for the historic importance of each of ten 
representative dates (Dates — Events). II. Indicate for what 
each of ten prominent men was celebrated (Men — Events). 
Ill. Mention the name of the man prominently connected with 
each of ten historic events (Events— Men). IV. Define in a 
short sentence each of ten historic terms (Historic Terms). 
V. Make a list of all the political parties that have arisen in the 
United States since the Revolution, and state one principle advo- 
cated by each (Political Parties). VI. Indicate the great divisions 
or epochs of United States history (Divisions of History). VII. On 
an outline map of the United States (supplied) draw the land 
boundaries of the United States at the close of the Revolution, 
and indicate the different acquisitions of territory since that 
date (Map Study). The questions were as follows:

  The Measurement of Other Grade Subjects _ 195 
The tests are easily administered. There should be 
further specific directions as to scoring the separate questions. 
The tests were originally given and standardized on the basis 
of the answers of students selected from the Texas normal 
schools and the University of Texas. There were 523 students 
from grades six and seven, 668 high school students, 207 normal 
school students, and 75 students from the University of Texas. 
No attempt has been made to fix grade standards. The test 
was used originally in order to study the question, ‘‘ What will a 
carefully constructed information test in United States History 
reveal regarding individual, sex, and school differences? ” 
Doubtless the most valuable purpose that can be served 
by this scale is that of the study of the effectiveness of various 
methods in fixing traditional facts in the minds of the children. 
The test is one of the most valuable of existing tests on the old 
type of history, which has for its end the mastery of the facts 
in the traditional course. It is doubtful if the test affords 
even a comprehensive review of old chronological history or if 
the details of each test are well selected. Under the Dates — 
Men test, 1846 would not be selected as an important date 
outside of Texas. It is doubtful if 1565 is one of the important 
dates in United States history. Under the Men— Events 
test, it is very doubtful if the ten most important men in our 
history are mentioned. There is a tendency, throughout the 
entire series of tests, to place as much emphasis on the earlier 
phases of United States History as upon the later. An 
examination of these tests gives rise to the question as to 
whether or not they will perform any desirable service in the 
hands of teachers for examination purposes. The same 
question is properly raised with reference to the Harlan tests, 
the Starch tests, the Davis tests, and the Raynor tests. 
They seem to miss the fundamental purpose of the review or 
examination as an instrument of teaching, and their tendency 
is to place emphasis upon the phases of history that are less 
important.

The Measurement of Other Grade Subjects 197 
The Van Wagenen tests‘ are referred to as scales. There 
is an information scale, a thought scale, and a character 
judging scale. It is doubtful if the term scale is properly 
applied. They will be referred to here as tests. The in- 
formation test is more extensive than the Bell and McCullum 
test. It consists of 32 questions, some of which have several 
parts that are practically equal to additional questions. 
Figure 11 shows a section of the scale, including the first 18 
questions. It is quite evident that the author, in these 
questions, is attempting to get a good sampling of the in- 
dividual responses of the pupils on history information. 
How fully and to what advantage they can be used by the 
individual teachers yet remains to be seen. For the superin- 
tendent who desires comparison among schools or teachers, 
or for the educational expert, who desires to survey an entire 
school system, they will afford comparisons which should 
form the basis of valuable inferences. The effects upon the 
curriculum of frequent uses of the test will need to be watched 
carefully and properly guarded. 
The thought test is significant in that it recognizes the im- 
portance of thought or content considerations in the study of 
history. It is at least to be commended as a first attempt at 
attacking this difficult phase of history work. Questions 
I, 2, 3, 7, 13,19, and 22, which follow herewith, are illustrative 
of the questions in the thought test. 
1. Before the steamboats were made people used to travel on 
the ocean in sailboats. Steamboats were not made until a long, 
long time after the European people came to make their homes in 
America. 
How do you think these early European settlers came to 
America ? 
2. A little before the year 1500 the people of Europe were 
anxious to find a new way to get to India. Some people thought 
that India might be reached by sailing westward across the At-

lantic Ocean. Columbus was one of these people. It was at this 
time that Columbus found America. 
What do you think Columbus was looking for when he found 
America? 
3. A hundred years ago it took a letter several days to go from 
New York to Boston. To-day it takes only a few hours. 
Why do you think it took letters so much longer to go from 
New York to Boston 100 years ago than it does to-day? 
7. In 1829-30, it took over 160 hours of work to raise 50 bushels 
of wheat; in 1895-96, it took less than seven and a half hours of 
work to raise the same amount. 
How can you account for the difference? 
13. In 1660, the English Parliament passed the restrictions 
that certain colonial products, called enumerated articles, includ- 
ing sugar, tobacco, dyewoods and indigo, should be shipped from 
America only to England or to other English colonies. 
In 1663, an act of Parliament provided that all goods brought 
to the colonies must come from or through English ports. 
What do you think was the purpose of the English in thus seek- 
ing to regulate the trade of the colonies? 
1g. At the outbreak of the Civil War there were comparatively 
few factories for spinning and weaving of cloth in the South. 
They could no longer get cloth from the North and the Northern 
blockade shut it out from England. Besides they had little ma- 
chinery and no means of making machinery for spinning and 
weaving. 
In such a crisis how do you think the people of the South ob- 
tained the cloth necessary for clothing? 
22. At the close of the Revolutionary War many of the people 
in America were driven from their homes by official acts of a new 
state government, their property was taken, and they were de- 
prived of the right to vote or to hold public offices. 
How can you account for such action? 
No attempt will be made to give a critical evaluation of this 
test. That must be determined by its more extensive use. 
It may be noted in passing, however, that 13 of the 22 ques- 
tions in the thought scale relate to history preceding 1812.
-P-A-G-E-209
  The Measurement of Other Grade Subjects 199 
Studies which have been made of the relative importance of 
facts in American history as indicated by present social usage 
clearly point to the fact that the author of this test has 
greatly misplaced the emphasis. In fact, there is little 
evidence throughout the entire test that the author has in 
mind that history can be used in solving present-day 
problems. ; 
The character-judging test consists of fifteen questions 
dealing respectively with the following topics: (1) white man’s 
response to Indian treachery, (2) Nathaniel Hale, (3) John 
Quincy Adams’s refusal to remove a political opponent from 
ffice, (4) John Quincy Adams and the right of petition, (5) 
an Indian father’s love for his son, (6) Fletcher and the Earl 
of Belmont as governors of the New York Province, 1692-1698, 
(7) English Colonial soldiers, against the Indians in Massachu- 
setts, 1724, (8) Secretary Stanton’s behavior in tearing up a 
decree from President Johnson, (9) Indian Warfare, (10) Indian 
Warfare, (11) Indian Warfare, (2) Parliamentary retort, 
(x3) St. Clair and Butler against the Northwestern Indians, 
(24) Political prejudice, (15) Difference between Lieut. Derby 
and Secretary of War Davis during President Pierce’s adminis- 
tration. 
It will be observed that 7 of these 15 questions deal with 
Indians or Indian warfare in some form. One deals with 
colonial government, at least two with the question of political 
prejudice, and the latest date of any of the events is the one 
referring to Secretary Stanton during the administration of 
President Johnson. In view of this analysis, one may properly 
doubt the adequacy of the questions for testing character- 
judgment in history, particularly on a basis of present 
utility. The characters are too far removed. The appeal 
is not in any case strongly motivated. The examination, 
therefore, with this set of questions is sure to be largely a 
formal matter so far as the children, or even the teacher, are 
concerned.

Questions 1, 8, and 12 are quoted herewith. 
1. In 1772, there was a frontier wedding. The guests had come 
from many miles. “After a night of rough merriment and dancing 
the guests lay down to sleep under the roof of their host or in the 
near-by barns and sheds. When morning came two of their horses 
were missing. Not doubting that they had strayed away, three of 
the young men started out to find them. Soon several gunshots 
were heard and the three young men did not return. Believing 
that it was a small scalping party of Indians eight or ten more 
mounted the horses that stood saddled before the house and 
galloped across the fields in the direction of the firing; while 
others ran to cut off the enemy’s retreat.

8. General Grant had been very positive in demanding that 
all officers of the Confederate army should enjoy their liberty. 
Among those who had been imprisoned by order of the Secretary 
of War, Edwin M. Stanton, was General Clement C. Clay, an ex- 
United States senator from Alabama. He was taken ill in prison 
with asthma, and his wife came to Washington to solicit his re- 
lease. She went to President Johnson, and he gave her the neces- 
sary order, which she took back to Secretary Stanton. Stanton 
read the order, and, looking her in the face, tore it up without a 
word and pitched it into his waste-basket. The lady arose and 
retired without speaking; nor did Stanton speak to her.

near him, in a low voice, while he was pausing for a new start, 
“You speak for the present generation; I speak for posterity,” —

speaking till your audience arrives.”

The makers of history tests, thus far, have failed to com- 
prehend the true purpose of a review or examination lesson. 
Such a lesson should give a new view, should secure a re- 
organization of subject matter, and should provide for use or 
application. It should, in the best sense of the word, re- 
enforce the true purposes of the original teaching of the 
subject. In the case of history, if it is to serve the purpose of 
civic efficiency on the basis of social utility, much greater 
emphasis must be placed upon the organization of the material 
in the form of large motivated problems which look forward 
to present-day applications. The time spent on the modern 
periods of history must be greatly increased. The provision 
for carrying over and applying to present-day problems 
must be made on a more adequate basis. A review or exami- 
nation lesson should serve all of these purposes. To date, no 
test has been standardized which does accomplish these pur- 
poses. If standard tests are to be of service in history, they 
must be so constructed as to effect the desirable basic aims 
and outcomes of the subject. When this purpose has been 
served, the other subsidiary purposes, such as distribution of 
the children according to ability, a diagnosis of classroom 
results, and a more accurate grading of pupils, will follow. 
Diagnostic Tests in History.— Dr. Truman L. Kelly, 
in an experimental study of the analysis and prediction of 
ability of high school pupils,! has included a history test. 
This has not been developed and used sufficiently to indicate

  202 How to Measure 
its value, but there is, in this use of a test in history, a sugges- 
tion of possibilities which needs further attention. A test 
which is used merely to discover ability, in order to properly 
advise students to continue further work in the line, or to dis- 
cover lack of ability, in order to advise students to dis- 
continue work, — this is a use of the test which is less likely 
to formalize a content subject and which, when properly 
understood, has connected with it no undesirable results. 
Geography. — The tests available in geography at the 
present time are tests of the formal informational phases of 
the subject. The Starch tests+ cover the elements of five 
geography texts, and have been arranged in five parallel tests 
of equal value. They are in the form of mutilated sentences. 
They are of limited value for the reasons given in the 
introductory paragraphs of this chapter and under the dis- 
cussion of history. 
The Hahn-Lackey Geography Scale. — The Hahn-Lackey 
geography scale’ is an illustration of the application of 
scientific procedure on an extensive plan, the result being a 
scale involving both fact and thought questions developed 
on the plan of the Ayres spelling scale. The scale consists 
of about 200 questions, graded for difficulty for the fourth, 
fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth grades. The questions are 
based upon textbooks and cover the common subject matter 
of six recent texts. The scale, with complete instructions for 
grading each question, can be secured from the authors. 
Figure 12 shows typical data from the scale. A careful study 
of this section will doubtless convince any reader that the 
larger purposes of geography will not be furthered by the use 
of the test. While an attempt is made to involve thought 
questions, it will be seen that even these deal chiefly with 
fact or informational phases of the subject. It is doubtful, 
therefore, if the general use of this scale will be an advantage 
in any school or school system.

  204 How to Measure 
The Boston Tests in Geography.— These tests were 
prepared under the guidance of an educator who had given 
careful consideration to the true aims of geography in the 
schools. The result is that the two tests, one on the geography 
of the United States, and the other on the geography of 
Europe, consist of questions well chosen from the thought 
standpoint, and questions that are likely to have an influence © 
entirely in the right direction in the teaching of the subject. 
While the tests have never been fully standardized and are 
not available, they are of such significance in showing develop- 
ment in the right direction, that it will be worth while to 
describe them. This can be done in the words of the author.* 
The test was prepared with a view of ascertaining : 
(a) The character of the geographical knowledge of the pupils 
tested ; 
(b) The ability of the pupils tested to reason from geographical 
data ; 
(©) The relative adequacy of their knowledge of the general 
geographical features of the United States and Europe; 
and 
(d) Whether scientific measurement of educational results in 
geography is possible. 
Tue Scope oF THE TEST WuiIcH Was GIVEN 
It is obvious that a forty-five-minute test can cover only a 
limited field of geography. Therefore, the test was confined to 
the most important countries of the world, viz. the United States 
and the countries in Europe. Although these countries are studied 
chiefly in the fifth and sixth grades, by no means does it follow 
that simply fifth and sixth grade work was tested. The study of 
Europe and Canada in the sixth grade should certainly include the 
review of many essential features of the geography of the United 
States. In the seventh grade the work with Asia and Africa should 
involve not a little review of both the United States and Europe.

  The Measurement of Other Grade Subjects 205 
Indeed, the makers of a course of study cannot be justified in 
devoting so much time to Asia and Africa as is the case in our 
present course, unless such study requires full explanation of the 
relationship existing between these countries and the more pro- 
gressive countries of the world. Through the study of such re- 
lationship, there is obtained a definite review of many important 
facts and principles of the geography of the United States and 
Europe. 
Arms or GrocrapHy TEACHING 
As is well known, the conception of geography teaching to-day 
is quite different from that of fifty or even twenty-five years ago. 
Then the study of the subject consisted largely in memorizing 
definitions, in learning the location of places, and in learning un- 
related facts about the different countries of the world. 
At the present time we consider that the value of geography 
lies not so much in a knowledge of facts concerning the earth and 
its people as in an understanding of the various ways in which 
man’s activities are influenced by physical environment. 
As a result of the study of geography in the elementary school 
the pupil should gain: 
x. An abiding interest in the different peoples of the world, 
their industries, their achievements, and their relations to 
ourselves. 
2. A mastery of geographic facts and principles sufficient to 
enable him to explain: 
(a) The growth of the leading cities of a region. 
(6) The development of important industries. 
(c) The dependence of one part of the world upon another. 
3. A breadth of mind which will lead to a sympathetic under- 
standing of races and nations other than his own. 
4. A working knowledge of the subject by a thorough training 
in the use of maps, texts, and reference books so that he 
can work out new problems independently. 
In short, geography should help the pupil to interpret his en- 
vironment, which in the case of civilized man reaches out to all 
parts of the world.

  206 How to Measure 
QUESTIONS ON UNITED STATES 
(An outline map of the United States was printed at the head of 
the questions.) 
1. Locate on the map the cities named at the right : 
Cities Products 
2. In the column marked Minneapolis 
“products,” write opposite the Pittsburgh . 
name of each city the name of Lowell 
a product for which the city is New Orleans . 
noted. Duluth . : 
Galveston eae ts 
Lynn 
3. Give reasons for the growth of Minneapolis. 
4. Below is given a list of articles which we use in our homes. 
Write below each word the name of the state in which that article 
is produced in large quantities : 
cotton oranges cane sugar rice coal iron 
5. Write on the map the name of each state which you have 
just written in answering Question 4. 
6. Why do the states just east of the Rocky Mountains receive 
less rain than Massachusetts ? 
7. Explain the way in which the flood plains of the Mississippi 
River have been formed. 
QUESTIONS ON EUROPE 
(An outline map of Europe was printed at the head of the 
questions.) 
1. Locate on the map two seaports of European Russia. 
2. Why are the seaports of Russia not so important as the sea- 
ports of England? : 
3. Of what value to the countries of Europe are their colonies 
in other parts of the world?
-P-A-G-E-217
  The Measurement of Other Grade Subjects 204 
4. Why does England import large quantities of wheat? 
5. Write on the map the names of the leading manufacturing 
countries of Europe. 
6. Why has Germany become very important as a manufac- 
turing country? 
7. Why is the climate of Italy different from that of Germany? 
The results of the test show that it is possible to ascertain 
by carefully selected tests whether or not the true aims of 
geography have been accomplished in the teaching. It is 
evident that pupils may remember locational facts without 
being able to use these in any adequate way in,answering the 
questions which occur to one in daily life. This means that 
locational facts should be properly subordinated to other more 
vital phases of the subject. The close relationship between 
questions 1 and 2 in the test on the United States shows the 
correct method of fixing in mind the location of places through 
the study of facts which make those places worth remembering. 
The important consideration is not the locational facts, but 
the reasons behind them. There is little or no value in 
knowing the location of places to which no significance is 
attached. 
While it is possible that the standardizing of these tests 
would in time have worked harmful results in the Boston 
schools, they do indicate the type of questions that should 
form the basis of examinations or tests in geography. 
Language Tests.— Tests devised by Starch! and Charters? 
are available for testing the language errors of children. The 
Starch tests are designated ‘‘ Grammatical Scale A,” ‘“ Gram- 
matical Scale B,” ‘‘ Grammatical Scale C.” The same type 
of material is contained in each scale, although they are not 
guaranteed to be of equal value. The use of the three tests, 
however, would give a more accurate measure of the child’s 
1‘ Educational Measurements,” Chap. 7. 
2 See Bibliography at close of the chapter. 
 
-P-A-G-E-218
  208 How to Measure 
language ability. The tests are built on the plan of choice 
of words. They are illustrated by the following form (Scale 
A, Step 5, Sentence 2). 
“The Gazette reported (he; him) to be dead.” 
The pupil is to mark out the incorrect expression, leaving 
‘the correct one. The chief criticism of the Starch tests? 
is that they have not been devised on the basis of an extensive 
study of the errors actually made by children. For instance, 
in Scale A, there are thirty-seven errors. Eighteen of these 
do not appear in the Connersville, Boise, and Kansas City 
studies of the common errors of grade children. Of the other 
19, there are 2 on the double negative; 2, sequence of tenses ; 
3, use of shall and will; and 7, choice between the objective 
and nominative form of the pronoun. In view of the in- 
adequacy of these tests, it seems unnecessary to go into detail 
with reference to the scoring or use of the tests. Quite surely, 
however, the teacher will find in these tests some helpful 
suggestions. Tentative standards are given by the author, 
making possible comparison. 
The Charters’ Language Test covers only pronouns. It is 
based upon a careful study of the pronoun mistakes of school 
children, as indicated by the collection and study of more 
than 25,000 errors that pupils made in using pronouns in 
their oral language. The test consists of sentences, such as: 
“8. Who do you want? 
“36. They made baskets and filled it with holly.” 
in which there are errors in the use of a pronoun. The pupil 
is required to write the correct form. The test is designed to 
be used in grades three to eight, and to measure the pupil’s 
ability to uSe the correct forms of pronouns. The test is of 
the right type and is based upon a fundamental study so 
that there is in it no misplaced emphasis. The teacher will 
need to use a score sheet for her pupils in order to locate the 
specific errors made by each pupil. 
1 They should be designated as “language tests,”’ not “grammatical scales.”

The Measurement of Other Grade Subjects 209 
Grammar. — Standard tests in grammar!. have been 
devised by Starch and Charters, and one is in preparation by 
Buckingham. The Starch grammatical tests have for 
their purpose the measuring of grammatical knowledge — 
Test 1, parts of speech; Test 2, cases; Test 3, tenses and 
modes. These tests are of very doubtful value for use in 
the grades. The studies by Hoyt and Briggs! have shown 
that it is undesirable to teach formal grammar in the grades. 
The Charters test in grammar is the same as the language 
test, except that the pupil is required to give the grammatical 
rules upon which the corrections are based. It is doubtful 
if the giving of such rules is a desirable practice in the grades. 
It is not recommended, therefore, that the grammatical 
section of the Charters test be used. 
Music. — Seashore ! has devised a prognostic test of musical 
talent, which has been perfected, and which should prove of 
unusual value. For a number of years Dr. Seashore has been 
refining this test. The test discovers musical sensitivity, 
musical memory and imagination, musical intellect, and 
musical feeling, with an accuracy which justifies a definite 
conclusion with reference to the musical talent of the pupil 
tested. As knowledge of this test becomes available, there 
is no doubt that it will be used more and more widely in 
discovering for further education the students of unusual 
ability, as well as those who have so little ability that it is 
useless for them to put further time on the study of music.

  CHAPTER IX 
THE MEASUREMENT OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
Tr is possible that some day high school pupils will be so 
distributed, on the basis of ability, and so managed, by teachers 
who are thoroughly competent and sympathetic, that formal 
examinations will disappear entirely from the high school, 
or will appear no longer as formal examinations, but merely 
as review recitations, thus forming a part of good teaching 
rather than a part of an examination scheme. As long, 
however, as more or less formal examinations continue to be 
given, teachers and educators must continue in efforts to 
reduce the evils of the examination system by educating 
teachers in the matter of giving and grading examinations 
and by seeking in every way possible to standardize the tests 
which of necessity must be given. The standardized test, in 
almost every case, is more reasonable, shows fewer idiosyn- 
crasies, and shows more uniformity in grading, than do the 
ordinary unstandardized examinations. Apparently, there- 
fore, in secondary work, two movements must continue to 
develop — one looking toward the gradual elimination of the 
formal examination, the other looking forward to the standard- 
ization of such tests as are given. 
High School Tests. — Can the more strictly high school 
subjects, such as Latin, French, algebra, geometry, physics, 
ancient history, chemistry, general science, literature, 
composition, the commercial subjects, agriculture, home 
economics, and’manual training, be measured by standard 
tests and scales? The answer is, “‘ Yes, in so far as they are 
tool subjects or mechanical subjects.” Tests have been 
212
-P-A-G-E-223
  The Measurement of High School Subjects 213 
developed and more or less fully standardized in algebra, 
geometry, physics, Latin, German, French, ancient his- 
tory, and commercial subjects. It is true that, with the 
development of the junior high school, the line between 
high school and grade subjects is not so clearly defined as it 
once was, so that in the junior high school, and even in the 
senior high school for that matter, some grade tests are 
being used in diagnosing the condition of the child with 
reference to the fundamental subjects or determining his 
efficiency for certain lines of work, particularly the commercial 
work. For such purposes, therefore, grade tests, such as 
diagnostic tests in arithmetic, reading for speed and accuracy, 
writing, spelling, and composition, are used to a considerable 
extent. 
Assuming that the new entrance age for secondary work is 
twelve or the arrival of adolescence, then we may expect 
that these tests will be used more and more for determining 
the condition of the child with reference to the mastery of the 
fundamentals of grade work. 
Why Tests Have Developed More Slowly in High School 
Work. — The work of developing standard tests in the 
secondary subjects has proceeded more slowly than in the 
elementary subjects. Since tests are developed chiefly by 
educational experts in colleges and universities, and since 
such experts are as interested in the secondary schools as in 
the elementary schools, in fact more interested from the 
standpoint of training teachers, it appears that the reason 
why standard tests and scales have not been developed for 
high school subjects so rapidly as in the elementary subjects 
must be due to some intrinsic values or limitations involved 
in the subjects themselves. 
The reasons are: First, most of the high school subjects 
are not tool subjects. They are of value chiefly because of 
content and appreciative values. These values are more 
intangible, more difficult to measure, than the simple elements 
 
-P-A-G-E-224
  214 How to Measure 
involved in the tool subjects. Second, the old academic view- 
point that secondary work is merely preparatory is changing. 
The old viewpoint made the mastery of subject matter, as 
such, the essential consideration. The present tendency, 
‘however, is to minimize the importance of high school work 
as merely preparatory, to look more towards use and appli- 
cation, and to make of the high school a real people’s school 
serving the broader aims of education. The efficiency of 
work on this basis cannot be tested nearly so well by exami- 
nation methods. Even a subject like mathematics does not 
become a tool subject for a large percentage of pupils. 
Apparently, therefore, appreciative values and an under- 
standing of the subject from the standpoint of enjoyment 
and perspective are just as important as the mere mastery of 
subject matter. Third, it is in subjects like literature and 
history especially that the fact, subject matter basis is par- 
ticularly undesirable. Literature, to be effective and to carry 
over into later life, must be taught on a basis of appreciation 
and enjoyment. It does not lend itself to rigid testing. 
History, likewise, deals with life problems, which depend 
for their development upon present-day problems, pupil 
interests, community contacts, and teaching equipment. 
So that any attempt to reduce history to a mere mechanical 
basis renders it of little value. 
In short, standard tests and scales have proven of value 
chiefly in measuring the tool subjects and the mastery of 
subject matter. The high school curriculum has many other 
values, some of which are possibly even more important than 
the strictly measurable ones. It will be worth while, how- 
ever, to note the development of scales in high school subjects 
in so far as they have developed. 
Algebra. —It is generally considered that algebra in its 
more fundamental processes is a tool subject which may be 
measured with a degree of accuracy approximating the simpler 
fundamental processes in arithmetic. The attempts to 
 
-P-A-G-E-225
    The Measurement of High School Subjects 215 
formulate scales or standard tests in algebra have proceeded 
with greater rapidity than any other high school subject. 
Among the tests available are: the Monroe “ Standardized 
Research Tests in Algebra,” the Rugg and Clark “ Stand- 
ardized Tests in First Year Algebra,” and the Hotz “ First 
Year Algebra Scales.” 
1. The Monroe Tests are based upon the assumption that 
the equation is the central fact of algebra. The tests cover 
the simple operations as follows: Test 1, removal of paren- 
theses; test 2, clearing the equation of fractions; test 3, 
solving for x, a special case of division; test 4, transposition ; 
test 5, collecting terms; test 6, solution of simple equations. 
2. The Rugg and Clark Standardized Tests in First Year 
Algebra have been very generally used. They have been quite 
fully standardized. They will be found of interest to teachers 
of algebra, and, if properly used, will be of considerable value. 
The chief criticism of the tests is that they attempt to 
cover the subject as fully as it is covered by textbooks and, 
on the whole, seem a little more difficult than necessary. 
Even so, they will be found much simpler and much more 
reasonable than tests which teachers ordinarily give. This 
will be apparent from an examination of a few of the tests.

The time allowance for test 4,is 3 minutes, for test 5, 
2 minutes, and for test 8, 4 minutes. Time limits have been 
fixed for each test and tentative standards have been deter- 
mined. For example, the average of 27 schools on test 5 
was 10.4 examples attempted with 9.7 correct. 
3. The Hotz First Year Algebra Scales have been worked 
out on a scientific basis and the problems located on a point 
scale. This is an advantage to the extent that teachers 
understand its value. The problems differ from those in a 
standard test in that they are of increasing difficulty. The 
pupil is measured by the point which he reaches on the scale. 
This requires the scale to grow sufficiently difficult that he 
will at some point fail to go farther. The test in multi- 
plication and division, series B, which follows herewith, is 
illustrative.

There is no doubt that any of these tests in algebra will 
prove of value. They have been standardized, they permit 
comparison, they will be valuable for research purposes, 
and they have the advantage when used by teachers for 
promotion purposes of avoiding the unusually difficult prob- 
lems often used by teachers in final examinations. In 
other words they are more reasonable than tests usually 
given by teachers. Teachers frequently have erroneous 
ideas about the promotion of children; some even think 
it to their credit to fail a large number of pupils. If a pupil 
can pass simple tests such as the Monroe tests, he should be     
    
 
-P-A-G-E-230
  220 ‘How to Measure 
permitted to go forward with advanced work. While the 
Monroe tests cover only the simple fundamental processes 
of first year algebra, the Rugg and Clark tests cover the entire 
field of secondary algebra. The tests will distribute pupils 
so as to show a teacher that she is instructing a group of 
pupils who differ widely in ability and need help and drill on 
widely varying details. The wise teacher of algebra will 
keep for every pupil a card showing his mistakes or weak- 
nesses, such as mistakes in sign, errors in copying, errors in 
factoring, etc. The standard tests will further aid in locating 
pupils’ weaknesses. Every teacher of mathematics in a 
high school and every superintendent should become familiar 
with at least one of the available tests in algebra. 
Geometry.—The Stockard and Bell‘ test in geometry 
consists of 70 questions arranged in 20 groups. In devising 
the test “the attempt was made to call for information that 
is to be found in all standard textbooks; to test for important 
and fundamental principles of geometry; to provide such “a 
range of questions as to be representative of the whole field of 
elementary geometry, and to include memory facts, knowl- 
edge of content, organization of subject matter, and partic- 
ularly ability to do originals; and to confine the list to such 
dimensions that every question could be tried by the average 
high school pupil in 40 minutes.” 
The 20 groups “involve drawing figures, naming figures, 
indicating order of development in demonstrations, complet- 
ing statements, stating the converse, definitions, regular 
polygons, parts of a demonstration, angular relations, area 
of a trapezoid, angles in polygons, angles in circles, con- 
gruency, similarity of triangles, loci, auxiliary lines, simple 
constructions, ratio and proportion, algebraic expression of 
geometric relations, and equivalent construction.” 
It is evident that the authors have attempted to measure 
quite fully the student’s mastery of the subject matter of

elementary geometry. The test was given to 372 school 
students who had completed a year’s work in geometry. 
About one third of the pupils tested were able to attempt all 
of the questions. On the basis of the tests given, the different 
questions are rated. The authors think the test not very 
practical for general high school use. It is too lengthy and, 
on the whole, a little too difficult. Teachers may use it, 
however, for diagnostic purposes or purposes of research. 
Diagnostic Tests in Mathematics. — Six tests have been 
selected by Anna L. Rogers.!. The tests, together with the 
time for explaining and giving the same, are as follows:

The total time required, 97 minutes, is just a little more 
than 2 regular high school periods. Yet in that brief time 
these tests enable a competent teacher to diagnose the mathe- 
matical ability of ninth grade pupils with a view to improve- 
ment in the classification of students in the high school by 
eliminating from the mathematics classes those unfit for . 
further mathematical training, and selecting those capable 
of progressing at a more rapid rate than the majority. The 
tests also serve to discover particular lines of mathematical 
weakness. They may be given in the seventh and eighth 
grades, but, when so given, the time limits must be considerably 
extended. These tests are “‘ designed to measure the more 
important phases of mathematical capacity demanded by 
high school mathematics, and, in particular, the ability to 
manipulate numerical and algebraic symbols, the ability to

grasp and handle spacial relations, and the ability to deal 
effectively with words. They are of such a nature as to enable 
an intelligent teacher to form an independent estimate of 
the pupil’s mathematical capacity and likelihood of success 
in further lines of mathematical work. They measure 
original ability rather than effect of training.” 
Miss Rogers has given directions for giving the tests and 
evaluating the scores, and has fixed tentative standards. 
She says, “ As tentative standards, we suggest: (1) Where a 
pupil’s score is greater than 150, he has capacity to progress at 
a more rapid rate than the ordinary high school student. 
(2) Where a pupil’s score is less than —150, he shows inca- 
pacity to progress in mathematics at the rate of the ordinary 
high school student and, other things being equal, should be 
released from further training in the subject.”” The group 
coming between —150 and +150 is considered the normal 
group in high school mathematics. 
Henmon’s Latin Tests. — Prof. V. A. C. Henmon of the 
University of Wisconsin has developed a series of vocabulary 
tests, A, B, C, and D, which are of equal difficulty and in 
which the words are arranged in order of difficulty. All of 
the words in these tests have been carefully evaluated. A 
series of sentence tests is also available, consisting of tests 
1 and 2, of equal difficulty, and test 3, in which the sentences 
are all of approximately the same difficulty. Standard 
scores are given for both the vocabulary and the sentence 
tests. One test is required for each pupil. 
The Henmon tests in Latin have several advantages over 
ordinary tests given by teachers. In thé first place, they are 
scientifically constructed, and they are based upon vocabulary 
which is common to Caesar, Cicero, Virgil, and 13 of the 
most frequently used first year Latin texts. In the second 
place, the tests are thoroughly standardized, making possible 
accurate grading and comparison with other schools, with 
other classes, or among pupils of the same class. In the third   
     
-P-A-G-E-233
    The Measurement of High School Subjects 223 
place, such tests are helpful in the study and analysis of 
class work. This is well illustrated in the overlapping of 
abilities in successive years as shown by these tests. In test 
A the medians for the first year range, for different classes, 
from 1 to 11, the median for all first year classes being 4. 
In the second year the class medians range from 4 to 19, the 
median for the year being 7. In the third year the class 
medians range from 3 to 25, the median for the year being 
20. If corresponding medians for various schools show such 
wide variation, the individual scores must evidently show 
very much greater range. The overlapping of abilities in 
Latin is thus seen to be comparable to the overlapping of 
abilities in other subjects. 
The administering of standard tests of this kind should 
discover the pupils of exceptional interest and ability on the 
one hand, and pupils on the other hand who, through lack of 
ability or interests, do so poorly that it is useless to have 
them continue the study. 
In so far as Latin is a tool subject, standard tests are 
applicable. In so far as the subject is of interest chiefly be- 
cause of other values, to that extent the teacher should be 
cautious in using standard tests or should use them only for 
her own enlightenment, being careful that they do not 
formalize her work. This will mean that the results of the 
tests are in general not brought to the attention of the pupils. 
Physics. — A physics test has been devised by Professor 
Daniel Starch, University of Wisconsin. It consists of 75 
mutilated sentences. They cover the 102 facts, principles, 
and laws of physics which the author has determined upon 
as the most essential. The basis for the determination was 
an examination of 5 widely used textbooks. The tests are 
easily administered. The value of the tests, however, has 
not been demonstrated. It is doubtful if physics can be 
reduced to facts in such formal fashion as this test would 
suggest.

  224 How to Measure 
Commercial Tests. —In the volume, ‘‘ Commercial 
Tests and How to Use Them,” Sherwin Cody has brought 
together a summary of the use of tests in determining the 
relative standing of students graduating from the commercial 
departments of high schools. Tests are available, covering 
the following subjects: 
(1) Tabulating, mental alertness. 
(2) Reproducing instructions — designed to test memory and 
natural industry. 
(3) Invoicing. 
(4) Fundamentals of arithmetic, an adaptation of the Courtis 
tests. 
(5) Business arithmetic, including fractions, trade extensions, 
and percentage. 
(6) English, including spelling, elementary language, ad- 
vanced language, elementary punctuation, and advanced punctua- 
tion. 
(7) Letter writing. 
(8) Answering letters. 
(9) Stenographic tests covering transcribing and typewriter 
copying. i: 
(10) Copying for the mimeograph. 
(r1) Addressing envelopes with the pen and filing. 
For each of the above lines of testing there are duplicate 
tests, full directions for administering the tests, keys for grad- 
ing, and tentative standards. The need of such commercial 
tests is evident to those who have attempted to select steno- 
graphic help or to evaluate the products of various commercial 
schools. The test in transcribing, for instance, is quite defi- 
nite. The student is expected to transcribe a standard 
business letter of 300 words in 5 minutes. This means 
60 words per minute. In many high schools, where there 
is no particular standard, students are permitted to graduate 
with a speed in transcribing of only 30 words per minute 
or even less. In like manner, the student can be accurately

checked on ability to file, answer a letter, spell, or use the 
fundamental processes in arithmetic. One of the main values 
of Mr. Cody’s work is to suggest standards for commercial 
work, and all admit that this is a type of work which can be 
standardized. 
Sackett’s Ancient History Scale.— Some will doubt the 
value of this test because it attempts to reduce a thought 
subject to a mechanical basis. Professor Sackett has at 
least shown the difficulty of formulating an ancient history 
scale. His work is handled on an approved scientific basis, 
but if the premises are faulty the conclusion, of course, can- 
not be other than erroneous. What we want our students 
to get from ancient history is not a memory mastery of the 
facts, but, instead, an appreciation of the problems and the 
development of a method for the solution, not only of the 
problems of ancient history, but of present-day history. 
The scale (so called) consists of eight tests, each containing 
ten points. Test No. 1, which is typical, is as follows: 
For what are the following men noted? 
(1) Hannibal 
(2) Khufu or Cheops. .

  It is evident that this is a fact testing scale. Its general 
acceptance would quite surely be detrimental to the proper 
teaching of history. A student might have all knowledge 
as tested by this scale, and still be entirely lacking in the 
spirit and method of history. The test should be used with 
oO

  226 How to Measure 
extreme caution in order that it may not formalize the work. 
The caution should be even greater than in the case of the 
Latin tests referred to above, for history is in no sense a tool 
subject. The test should be used only for study and research 
purposes. The following illustration will make clear the 
meaning of research as here used: 
A teacher who had been teaching ancient history by out- 
line, endeavoring to master all of the facts in the book, was 
paired with another teacher who had the modern notion of 
motivation and problem organization of material, and the 
further notion that history was of value in so far as it had a 
bearing on the solution of particular problems at the present 
day. These teachers were encouraged to teach the same sub- 
ject in accordance with their respective ideas. At the end 
of the course comparison was made on the basis of the ques- 
tions used by the first teacher in former examinations. The 
tesults were entirely in favor of the second teacher. Possibly 
a fairer test and one even more favorable to the second 
teacher would have been a scientifically constructed stand- 
ardized test. On the other hand, if such standardized tests 
had been known to the second teacher in the beginning, it 
would doubtless have resulted in very much poorer work on 
her part because her work would have been formalized and a 
large part of the life taken out of it. At any rate, there is 
the possibility of real harm in using a formal test on a thought 
subject.

CHAPTER X 
THE MEASUREMENT OF GENERAL INTELLIGENCE 
“Tuts is an exceptionally slow class,” and “ I have such a 
large number of children this year who are very slow,” are 
expressions which the supervisor frequently hears as he passes 
from one classroom to another. These statements are based 
on actual facts in that they describe the condition of many 
children who are not making progress. The problem is a 
_ very real one to the teacher. 
It is also not infrequent to hear a teacher say, ‘‘ I have an 
exceptionally bright class this year,” or “ I have4or 5 children 
who are far ahead of the others.” It is unusual, however, 
to hear such statements followed with the remark, ‘I think 
certain children in this grade ought to be advanced to another 
grade.” The latter situation should become more common. 
In either case the problem is one of knowing the child’s 
mental age or general intelligence. He has been assigned to 
a certain grade chiefly on the basis of his chronological age 
or the number of years in school. He has been asked to do 
a certain type of work because children of his age who are 
normal are supposed to be able to doit. It may be that such 
children are being held back when they should be advanced, 
or the subject matter which is being presented in the regular 
class is not suited to them, and they are, therefore, in need 
of a different kind of subject matter presented in a special 
class. 
Sufficient information is available to show that general 
intelligence tests can be used to determine the mental ages of 
229 
 
-P-A-G-E-240
230 How to Measure 
children, and that this information can be used as a basis for 
reclassification of the pupils. In a city school system in 
which the Binet-Simon (old form) Test was being used, it 
was found that a great many children who were too old chrono- 
logically were also too old mentally for their grade, e.g. when 
children enter the first grade at the age of six, they are accord- 
ing to correct practice of normal age chronologically if they are 
6 or 7 years old in the first grade, 7 and 8 years old in the 
second grade, etc. If a child in the first grade is 8 years old, 
he is 1 year too old chronologically. If he tests 8 years old 
mentally he is also 1 year too old mentally. He should, 
therefore, be in the second or third grade, provided his school 
life has been normal. If not, he should receive the special 
attention that will place him with his appropriate group as 
soon as possible. In the school system referred to above, out 
of less than 500 children tested in 4 schools, 60 such children 
were found. All of these children were advanced one grade 
and all were able to continue with a good class standing in 
the grade to which they were promoted. 
In a small Iowa city 39 children out of a total of 177 chil- 
dren in 4 schoolrooms were advanced in the fall of 1915, on a 
basis of a good class standing and being too old for the grade 
in which they were working. These children were selected 
from grades 5, 6, 7, and 8. Eleven of them were advanced 
one half of a grade, 28 were advanced a full grade. At the 
end of the first semester, February, 1916, not a single pupil 
failed in gaining promotion, and only 3 received a class stand- 
ing of less than 85%. The fact that such a large number of 
children in a school system can be advanced to advantage on 
a very general measurement, and that so little material is 
available showing the results of such practice, is indicative that 
a general intelligence test which will measure in very definite 
terms the general intelligence of large groups of children is 
greatly needed, and can be used to prevent waste and un- 
satisfactory results in classroom practice.
-P-A-G-E-241
  The Measurement of General Intelligence 231 
General intelligence tests have also been used for a number 
of years to select children who are subnormal to be placed 
in special classes in which they will receive a different type 
of instruction. Before such tests were available these 
children were com- 
pelled to try to do 
the same work as 
the normal child, 
which resulted in 
failure. After 
numerous repeti- 
tions had occurred 
it was realized that 
they could not ad- 
vance. They were, 
therefore, assigned 
to some other class 
in which they were 
permitted to do 
the thing they were 
able to do, but 
only after the loss 
of much time and 
energy to both 
pupil and teacher. 
With the aid of a 
general intelligence 
test these children 
can be located Fic. 13.— Grapes From WHIcH 170 CHILDREN

about the necessity for re- 
classification in the regular classes or in the special classes 
has resulted from an apparent assumption that children of a 
certain age group are of the same mental age. This principle
-P-A-G-E-243
  
The Measurement of General Intelligence 233 
is seen in the practice of entering 6-year-old children into the 
first grade. At the end of one school year or at the age of 7 
years they are supposed to be ready for the second grade, and 
so forth. 
That all children of the same age are not of the same mental 
age is apparent from the following graph showing the mental 
ages of 159 unselected children, all of chronological age 9.

These 159 children make up the entire group of children 
9 years of age in a group of 743 children in 4 elementary 
schools who were tested with the Binet-Simon Test. Instead 
of all having a mental age of 9 years, only 48 showed exactly 
this age, 21 children had a mental age of a normal child at 
Io years of age, and 8 children a mental age of a normal 
child at 11 years of age, while 64 children showed a mental
-P-A-G-E-244
  234 How to Measure 
age of a normal child 8 years, 17 children a mental age of 7 
years, and 1 child a mental age of 6 years of age. These 
figures show the same differences in abilities of children as 
are found in all unselected groups whenever a test that will 
distribute mental age is used. 
Although much has been written about the wide differences 
in the abilities of children and sufficient evidence given to 
support such conclusions, yet classroom practice too often 
lags behind because of the slowness with which usable tests 
have been developed and placed in the hands of the teachers. 
The teacher finds it exceedingly difficult to see and to plan 
for the needs of the class as a whole. Likewise, the principal 
in his organization of classes is too much given to an organiza- 
tion on a basis of the needs of the group instead of the needs 
of the individuals in the group. Splendid attempts and good 
progress have been made in many places to recognize in a 
very definite way the individual difference among children, 
but in general, educational practice continues to handle them 
en masse on account of the lack of knowledge of group in- 
telligence tests. 
A test in the hands of the teacher that will enable her to 
know the mental ages of the children in her class as she 
knows their chronological ages, will be a long stride toward 
classroom practice which handles children on a basis of their 
individual needs instead of group needs. Such tests are now 
available. The teacher can determine the mental ages 
of all the children in her class in the same time that was 
formerly required by an expert to determine the mental age 
of a single child. 
The following group intelligence tests are now available: 
Trabue Language Scales, not devised originally to measure 
general intelligence, but found to do so with an accuracy that 
makes them very valuable; the Otis Group Intelligence Scale; 
Haggerty’s Intelligence Examinations, Delta 1 and Delta 
2; and Whipple’s Group Tests for the Grammar Grades.
-P-A-G-E-245
  The Measurement of General Intelligence 235 
TRABUE LANGUAGE SCALES 
Aim. — It has been found that the Trabue Language Scales 
will measure the general ability of pupils. 
Description of Tests. — The Trabue Language Scales consist 
of scales B, C, D, E, J, K, L, and M. Scales B, C, D, and 
E are practically equal to one another. They are intended 
to be used in pairs — B with C, and D with E — by teachers 
in determining the abilities of children between the ages of 
7 and 20. Each scale is made up of 8 to 10 sentences with 
words omitted which are to be supplied. ‘‘ The first sentence 
in each of these 4 scales is about 1 unit above an arbitrary 
zero point, the second sentence is approximately 1 unit more 
difficult than the first, and so on until the last sentence in 
each scale is about 11 units above zero.” 
Scales J and K are intended to measure the ability of 
adults, and are, therefore, of practically no value for public 
school purposes. 
Scales L and M, which are not equivalent to scales J and 
K, or to any other pair, are intended to measure the abilities 
of high school students. ‘‘ They have no very easy sentences, 
and the differences between the sentences are relatively small.” 
The grouping into pairs of these scales of equal value 
provides a duplicate test for checking. 
Below is given a copy of Language Scale B to show the 
nature of these scales:

to. To friends is always —— the —— it takes. 
Giving the Test. — The process of giving the Trabue Lan- 
guage Scales is very simple. A preliminary test is provided 
with simple sentences in order to make clear to the children 
exactly what they are expected to do. After this preliminary 
test has been given and explained fully, the children are ready 
for the regular test. - 
Each child is provided with a scale on which he writes his 
name, grade, and age. On each sheet is the instruction, 
“‘ Write only one word on each blank.’ Attention should be 
called to the fact that he will be given a time limit (7 minutes 
for scales B, C, D, and E; 5 minutes for L and M) in which 
to do as much as he can. He will possibly not be able to 
fill all the blanks. As soon as the time limit has expired 
see that every child stops work and all papers are collected. 
Scoring Results. — For the convenience of the teacher and 
the accuracy of the results, the author has provided a detailed 
scheme for scoring the answers to the different sentences, 
which is as follows: 
GENERAL SCHEME 
Score 2 
“A score of 2 points is to be given ,each sentence completed 
perfectly. Errors in spelling, capitalization, and punctuation 
should not be allowed to affect the score. 
Score 1 
“A score of 1 is to be given each sentence completed with only a 
slight imperfection. A poorly chosen word or a common gram-
-P-A-G-E-247
  
The Measurement of General Intelligence 237 
matical error, which makes the sentence less than perfect and yet 
leaves it with reasonably good sense, should serve to reduce the 
score from 2 to 1. 
Score o 
“A score of 0 is to be given if the sentence as completed has its 
sense or construction badly distorted. A sentence must have 
reasonably good meaning and express a sentiment which might 
honestly be held by an intelligent person in order to receive a higher 
credit than zero.” 
The following is a sample of the answers provided in this scheme, 
for the first three sentences of Scale B:

etc.   
The score for each sentence should be recorded on the margin 
of the test. After all the test papers have been scored, the

scores are transcribed to a Class Record Sheet. Below is 
given a copy of the Class Record Sheet provided by the author 
with the scores from a 4~-A class in a city school system.

This record is read as follows: S. L., age 10 years, 2 
months, made a score of 2 on the second sentence and a score 
of zero on all the others which gives him a score of 2; W. B., 
age 11 years 3 months, made a score of 2 on sentences 2, 3, 
and 6 and a score of zero on all the others making a total 
score of 6; etc. These scores are then distributed and the 
class median is determined, which for this class is 10.6.

  The Measurement of General Intelligence 239 
Interpreting and Using Results. — After the class records 
have been made and the class scores determined, the néxt 
problem for the teacher is to interpret her results and apply 
them to her classroom practice. This can be explained best 
by reference to concrete situations. 
The first point to be determined is the relation of the class 
score to any class standards. The class standards for the Tra- 
bue Language Scale as reported by the author are as follows:

  240 How to Measure 
The class score for the 4-A grade reported on the above 
class record sheet, Table 49, is 10.6. The standard score for 
this grade is 10.4. This class is, therefore, slightly above the 
standard. 
When the test has been given in other classes of the same 
city further comparisons can be made. Below are given the 
class scores from the 4—B grade in the same school and from 
the 4-A and 4-B grades in another school: 
  
  
  TABLE 51

I i | 0.6 10.6 
MMe eels.) 28a gosh 10.2 11.8 
BRUTAL esc. nd hie On: 10.4 
  
  
It is seen, therefore, that the class reported in Table 49, 
although above the standard, is below the 4-A grade of 
the other school, which attained a score of 11.8. A fur- 
ther analysis shows that these four classes have made 
scores equal to or above the standards, and also that school 
number 2 scored considerably ahead of school number 1. 
After the score for the entire class has been secured and 
interpreted the scores of individual pupils should be analyzed 
to ascertain whether or not all pupils are properly placed and 
are receiving proper instruction. For this purpose the class 
record sheet showing the score of each pupil should always 
be kept available for frequent reference by the teacher. 
By referring to the record of the class in Table 49, it will 
be seen that the lowest scores made by any boy or girl are 2 
and 8 respectively, and the highest 15 and 16 respectively. 
The lowest score made by any pupil is a score of 2 made by a 
boy, S. L., whose chronological age is 10 years, 2 months, and 
whose mental age as later determined by the Stanford Revi- 
sion of the Binet-Simon Test is 8 years, 2 months, or an Intelli-
-P-A-G-E-251
The Measurement of General Intelligence 24 
gence Quotient of 80.3. -The next lowest score is 6, which is 
also by a boy, W. B., whose chronological age is 11 years, 3 
months, and whose mental age on the Binet-Simon Test is 9 
years, 3 months, or an Intelligence Quotient of 82.2. The 
highest score made by any boy is 15, which was made by A. G., 
whose chronological age is 10 years, o months, and whose 
mental age is 10 years, o months, or an Intelligent Quotient of 
100.0; and the highest score of any pupil is 16, which was made 
by a girl, L. J., whose chronological age is 10 years, 8 months, 
and whose mental age is 12 years, 1 month, or an Intelligence 
Quotient of 113.2. It is evident, therefore, that some of 
these children should receiv2 special attention. The pupils 
who made the low scores are not benefiting from the class 
instruction to the extent they should. They should be placed 
in a special class where more individual or perhaps a different 
kind of instruction can be given. 
The question should likewise be raised in connection with 
the examination of any class, as to whether the pupils who 
make the highest scores should be advanced to another grade 
or be assigned to a faster group. In the group above it would 
seem that the girl, L. J., at least should be given such con- 
sideration. 
With the aid of the Trabue Language Scales the teacher 
can quickly determine the general intelligence of the class as 
a whole and also the general intelligence of each pupil in: her 
class. If there is a question of doubt about certain pupils, 
the results from the Trabue Language test can be checked 
by a more refined measurement, such as the Stanford Revision 
of the Binet-Simon Test. With such knowledge about the 
mental ability of her pupils the teacher can classify her pupils 
so that her instruction can be more effective. 
Otis Group INTELLIGENCE SCALE 
This scale has been devised in response to a wide demand for 
a test which will determine the general mental ability of 
R
-P-A-G-E-252
  242 How to Measure 
children in large groups. Since the ability to read is required 
to take this test, it is not applicable to persons with less than 
3 or 4 years of schooling. Of this test Dr. Lewis M. Terman 
says: ‘‘ With subjects of this much schooling, the Otis Scale 
probably comes as near testing raw ‘brain’ power as any 
system of tests yet devised.” 
The Aim. — The aim of this scale is to determine a pupil’s 
general mental ability. It is expected that the Otis Scale 
will be used for school purposes, to classify, quickly and effi- 
ciently, large groups of children on a basis of their mental 
ages, in order to meet more adequately their individual 
needs, and that the Binet-Simon Test and others will be 
used to supplement this scale in cases which are in doubt, 
or which call for more refined measurements. 
Description of the Test.— The Otis Group Intelligence 
Scale is divided into two forms, A and B, which are different 
in substance but similar in structure. Each form is in a 
separate booklet. By this means the same group of children 
can be examined at different times without a knowledge of 
the tests affecting the results. The total point score for each 
is the same. Each form has ten tests, as follows:

The scale can be used with children in grades 4 through the 
high school, and even with university students if desired. 
Giving the Test. — Any person who is able to teach can, .
-P-A-G-E-253
  The Measurement of General Intelligence 243 
after a little study, apply these tests with a sufficient degree 
of accuracy to insure satisfactory results. Before attempting 
to give the tests, however, the teacher should practice on the 
instructions given in the Manual of Directions, which should 
always be available. Each child must have a copy of the 
scale in booklet form. The instructions for each test are 
written at the top of the test, but divided from the test by 
a heavy black line. Too much care cannot be exercised in 
seeing that the children follow specifically the instructions as 
outlined. 
Scoring Fesults.— An examiner’s key on transparent 
paper is provided, which makes the scoring of the papers a 
very simple matter. For the scoring of all tests except test 
3, the check mark (+/) opposite each correct answer can be 
used. The sum of the number of checks will be the score of 
the individual on the test. 
In scoring test 3, a check should be placed after each 
correct answer and a cross after each incorrect answer only. 
No attention need be paid to omitted answers. The score 
will be the number of correct answers minus the number of 
incorrect answers; that is, “ the number of checks minus 
the number of crosses.’”’ (For more detailed instructions 
for scoring, see pages 29 and 30 of the Manual of Directions, 
1919 edition.) The sum of the scores on each individual test 
will give the individual’s score. This score can be placed on 
the front page of each individual’s test sheet, or it can be 
transferred to a record sheet on which the name of each child 
can be written and the score on each test, together with his 
total score, placed opposite his name. 
The score of each pupil can be expressed in terms of first, 
mental age; second, intelligence quotient; third, percentile 
rank; fourth, coefficient of brightness. 
To date no age norms are available from which a child’s 
mental age can be determined. The author, however, is 
collecting results from these tests wherever they are given,
-P-A-G-E-254
244 How to Measure 
and undoubtedly will have such age norms in publication 
in the very near future. 
To secure an age norm for the group tested the exami- 
nation booklets are arranged according to the exact ages of 
the children. ‘“‘ To do this it will be necessary to take account 
of the date of the birthday. The Total Score Norm for the 
age of 12 years may then be taken to be the average of the 
Total Scores of all pupils whose ages were between 11 years, 
no months, and 13 years, no months. The Norm for the 
age of 12 years, 1 month, may be taken as the average of the 
Total Scores of all pupils whose ages were between 11 years, 
x month, and 13 years, 1 month, etc. The Mental Age of a 
pupil may then be seen at a glance by noting the agefor which 
his Total Score is the Norm.” 
The intelligence quotient of a pupil up to 16 years of age 
can be secured by dividing his mental age by his chronological 
age. Beyond 16 years of age, the mental age is divided by 
16, for the reason that an individual is practically mature 
at 16 years of age. For a further discussion on determining 
the scores, especially the percentile rank, and the coefficient 
of brightness, reference should be made to pages 32 to 36 of 
the Manual of Directions. 
Interpreting and Using Results. — In order to indicate to 
the teacher how she can determine the general intelligence of 
her pupils with the use of this test, the following results are 
given which were secured from two 4—B teachers and two 4-A 
teachers in a city school system. In all 104 children were 
tested. After the scores were obtained, the papers were 
classified according to the age groups, i.e. all the papers of 
children 8 years, o months, to 10 years, o months, were placed 
in one group; all the papers of children 9 years, o months to 
II years, o months, were placed in another group, etc. The 
average of the scores on the papers in the first group gave 
the age norm of the 9-year-old children; the average of the 
scores on the papers in the second group gave the age norm 
 
-P-A-G-E-255
The Measurement of General Intelligence 245 
of the 1o year old children, etc. The normal chronological 
ages for the fourth grade are 9 and 10 years. The age norms 
for these two groups in these four classes are 54.4 and 
54.6 respectively. 
The small number of papers makes these figures only 
tentative norms. These norms would undoubtedly be changed 
by a larger number of papers, which are necessary to establish 
reliable standards. 
After the age norms for the different ages are secured the 
mental ages of the different individual pupils can be obtained 
by noting the age for which the pupil’s total score is the norm. 
For example, R. T., a 4-A pupil, 10 years, 1 month, made a 
score of 54. His mental age is, therefore, almost 10 years. 
Another 4—A pupil, S. H., ro years, 4 months, made a score 
of 51. He is, therefore, less than 10 years old mentally. 
Until there is an age norm for children at every age including 
years and months, the exact mental ages cannot be determined. 
When that information is available to the teacher, she can for 
all practical purposes determine the mental ages of her children 
whereby a far better grouping or classification can be secured 
than on the basis of the chronological ages. 
Haccerty’s INTELLIGENCE EXAMINATIONS: 
Delia 1 and Delta 2 
Aim. — The purpose of this test is to measure the native 
ability of groups of pupils in the elementary school in order to 
group them properly or in a limited way to measure their 
progress. ? 
Description of Tests. — The tests appear in two pamphlets, 
the one, Intelligence Examination: Delta 1, for grades one to 
three inclusive ; and the other, Intelligence Examination : Delta 
2, for grades three to nine inclusive. Delta 1 contains the 
following exercises :

Exercises 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 determine the pupil’s score; 
the others are preliminary exercises and are not counted in 
scoring. Simple instructions are given to the teachers for 
the different performances under each exercise. The diffi- 
culty which small children would encounter in reading or in 
following complicated instructions is avoided. Delta 2 is an 
adaptation of the army intelligence tests. It has been used 
more widely than Delta 1. In addition to the examination 
of 15,000 school children in the state of Virginia, it has been 
used extensively in many of the larger city school systems 
throughout the country. It consists of the following exercises : 
Exercise 1. Sentence Reading 
Exercise 2. Arithmetical Problems 
Exercise 3. Picture Completion 
Exercise 4. Synonym-Antonym 
Exercise 5. Practical Judgment

Giving the Tests. — A carefully devised manual of directions 
is provided by the author which must be in the hands of the 
teacher and thoroughly understood by her before any attempt 
is made to give the tests. The instructions in the manual 
are simple so that no teacher should have any difficulty in 
applying the tests to her class. Each child in the class must 
be provided with a test. The entire class can be examined 
at once. : 
Scoring the Results.— The Manual of Directions also 
provides explicit instructions for scoring the tests. A Scor-
-P-A-G-E-258
  248 How to Measure 
ing Key is provided for both tests. The score of each pupil 
is the sum of the scores made on the several items of the 
test. The maximum score for each test is as follows:

After the score for each pupil is determined these scores are 
transferred to a class record sheet and the median class score 
is determined. The results are given in terms of median 
scores and age norms for each grade. 
Using the Results.— These Intelligence Examinations 
have been used with a sufficiently large group of pupils to 
insure standards that are exceedingly valuable for comparative 
purposes. Test Delta 2 has been used with about 20,000 
children and Test Delta 1 with 4000 children. The following 
tentative standards are available:

From the above standards the teacher can tell whether 
or not her class as a whole measures up to the standard for the 
grade. She can also determine the mental age of each in- 
dividual pupil in her class, whether or not they are above or 
below the standard for the grade. With the aid of such a 
test the teacher should have no difficulty in determining the 
native ability of each individual pupil in her class. 
The Group Tests for Grammar Grades, by Dr. G. M. Whipple,! 
are group intelligence tests similar in many respects to the 
Otis and Haggerty tests.. The purpose of these tests is to 
select the brighter pupils from grades 4, 5, and 6, but the tests 
quite fully distribute pupils in these grades according to 
intelligence. It takes 92 minutes to give the tests to a sixth 
‘grade, the entire room being tested at once. But when the 
papers are scored, the teacher has before her a fair measure 
of the intelligence of each pupil in the group.

250 How to Measure 
Tue STANDARD REVISION OF THE BINET-SIMON TEST 
This test is possibly the most accurate instrument so far 
available with which to determine the native ability of 
American children. On account of the fact that from 30 to 
60 minutes are consumed in examining each pupil and that 
special training is required by the one applying the test, it 
cannot be used for the examination of large groups of children 
in a limited time. After the group tests suggested above have 
been given, there will always be questions which can be settled 
only by a more refined measurement such as the Stanford 
Revision of the Binet-Simon Test. It is not too much to 
expect that the group intelligence tests will open the way and 
extend the use of the latter test. 
An illustration of how this test will supplement the group 
tests is given in Table 57. The teachers in two 4—A classes 
in a city school system examined their children with the 
Trabue Language Scale. In all 44 children were tested. 
All of them were also examined by a psychologist with the 
Stanford Revision of the Binet-Simon Test. 
The standard for the 4—A grade on the Trabue Scale is 10.4. 
Nineteen of the 44 children made a score below this standard. 
On the Binet-Simon Test all but 10 of these 44 children made 
an Intelligence Quotient above 80. 
Table 57 gives the scores on the Trabue Language Scale and 
the Binet-Simon Test for those 18 children who scored below 
the standard for the Trabue Language Scale. 
From these figures it is seen that 9 of the 14 children 
scoring from 8.0 to 10.3 inclusive on the Trabue Scale tested 
between 80 to go Intelligence Quotient or below. In the 
group between 80 and go Intelligence Quotient are found, 
according to Terman, “ those children who would not accord- 
ing to any accepted social standards be considered feeble- 
minded, but who are nevertheless far enough below the 
actual average of intelligence among races of western   
-P-A-G-E-261

European descent that they cannot make ordinary school 
progress or master other intellectual difficulties to which 
average children are equal.” Of the children scoring 
below 8 on the Trabue Language Scale all except one 
(Intelligence Quotient 81.8) tested below 80 Intelligence 
Quotient.

In this particular city it is the practice to consider pupils 
eligible to a special class when they test below 80 Intelligence 
Quotient. It would seem, therefore, that by having the 
psychologist test with the Binet-Simon Test the children 
who scored below 1o.3 on the Trabue Language Scale, those 
children could easily be detected who should receive special 
instruction. 
In the same way the children who test very high on the 
 
-P-A-G-E-262
  252 How to Measure 
Trabue Language Scale should be given an individual examina- 
tion for further classification. 
By combining the use of the Binet-Simon test with such 
group intelligence tests as the Trabue Language Scale, the Otis 
Intelligence Scale, the Haggerty Intelligence Examinations: 
Delta 1 and Delta 2, and the Whipple Group Tests for the 
Grammar Grades, classroom practice can readily be placed 
on a more scientific basis. The availability of such tests 
makes it possible for every teacher to know the mental age 
of every child. 
The training of a teacher in a normal school should include 
a course in the testing of general intelligence so that every 
teacher may apply any general intelligence test with a reason- 
able degree of accuracy. Moreover, every teacher could 
well afford to spend six weeks in the summer in an institu- 
tion where such training could be secured. 
On account of the detailed instructions necessary for the 
application of the Stanford Revision test, no person should 
attempt to give it without having access to the ‘‘ Measure- 
ment of Intelligence” by Terman, or some book like it in 
which such instructions are given.

CHAPTER XI 
STATISTICAL TERMS AND METHODS 
Tue purpose of this chapter is to give only so much informa- 
tion from the science of statistics as the teacher needs to know 
in order to administer a test, tabulate the scores, and interpret 
the results. This will necessitate, also, the explanation of 
statistical terms sufficiently to enable one to understand such 
terms when used in the discussion of the measurement of any 
school subject. 
Securing Comparable Results. — One decided advantage of 
a standard test is the possibility of comparing the results with 
similar results in other rooms, other school systems, or with 
tentative or fixed standards. Manifestly, such comparisons 
can be made to advantage only when the tests have been 
given under similar conditions. The following suggestions 
may be considered as rules of the game for securing com- 
parable results: 
1. In giving a test it is essential that the conditions of 
the test be kept constant. 
2. The directions which accompany a test should be followed 
in every detail. If possible, use a stop watch to secure exact 
time, when there is a time limit. 
3. It is an advantage if the examiner has a clear conception 
of the nature of the test, its purpose, and the use to be made 
of it. 
4. At the time of giving the test all needed secondary data 
should be secured, such as name, age, grade, school, date, etc. 
5. Most tests as a part of their instructions provide for 
a preliminary trial in order to make pupils familiar with the 
254
-P-A-G-E-265
  
Statistical Terms and Methods 255 
test. In case such provision is not made in the instructions, 
the teacher should devise a preliminary test which should be 
similar but somewhat easier than the one to be given, in 
order that the pupils may thoroughly understand what is to 
be done and how to do it. 
6. The test should be handled as nearly as possible just 
as any other regular lesson. An appeal to extra effort is 
allowable, but other comments likely to secure results that 
are not normal should be avoided. Appeals which are made 
to the child’s desire to do well in the test should be included 
as a part of the regular instructions, in order that conditions 
of the test may be uniform for comparisons. 
7. For many purposes a single test is sufficient. In case the 
decision to be based upon a test is of unusual importance, 
at least two specimens should be taken, or two tests given, or 
the judging be done by at least two competent judges. In case 
there is a decided discrepancy between the two results, the 
teacher will realize that further testing should be done. As 
will be apparent from further study of statistical methods, a 
score for a class is much more reliable than for an individual, 
and the score for an entire city more reliable than that for a 
single class. This is due to the fact that slight errors tend to 
balance each other in such a way as to give a more accurate 
judgment on a large group than on a small group or a single 
individual. 
8. Care should be taken not to use the material of stand- 
ardized tests for practice purposes. 
g. In case the test is given frequently the results will be 
much more representative if an alternative test of equal value 
has been provided by the person who devised the test. 
Using a Standardized Test. — Teachers to-day can scarcely 
attend an educational meeting or read an educational magazine 
without hearing about scales and standardized tests, and their 
advantages in measuring the work of the schools. For the 
teacher thus interested, but who has not had a normal school 
 
-P-A-G-E-266
  256 How to Measure 
or college course in educational measurement, the following 
directions are given with the assurance that an intelligent 
teacher may go forward in such work even though she may not 
have the help and guidance of a trained supervisor. 
1. Selecting the Test. —In selecting the test to use, the 
teacher may well be guided by the particular purpose which 
she has in mind. The preceding chapters dealing with the 
available tests in different subjects will permit the teacher to 
make a choice on the basis of the best test for the particular 
purpose. In general, those tests should be chosen which have 
been _most widely used, and which require the least time for 
giving and marking the papers. Yet this is not an infallible 
‘tule. The Woody tests are certainly much more valuable 
than the Courtis tests in arithmetic. Yet the Woody tests 
have been given very little in comparison with the wide use 
of the Courtis tests. They are a little more difficult to 
administer and to score. Yet, from the standpoint of value 
in diagnosing the pupils’ difficulties, they are far superior to 
the Courtis tests. The tests that are going to survive and 
show value in the next few years cannot be determined at 
this time. The final judgment upon the test must be passed 
by the teacher in the schoolroom on the basis of its value in 
helping her in her work of discovering the needs of the children 
and applying the appropriate remedies. It may be properly 
assumed that, although a test is more difficult and requires a 
longer time, if it is superior in every respect, the teacher will 
find the time for giving it. It requires considerable time to 
give Gray’s Oral Reading Test, yet the results of giving the 
test are so valuable that the teacher does not hesitate to take 
the necessary time for giving it. 
When a test may be chosen on the basis of difficulty, as in 
the use of the Ayres Spelling Scale, the teacher should keep 
in mind that a good test should be so difficult that no pupil 
will make a perfect score, and sufficiently easy that most pupils 
in the grade will secure a score which is reasonably satisfactory.

2. Giving the Test. —In giving a test the teacher should 
follow carefully the printed directions which accompany the 
test. This is the chief rule to keep in mind. Other details 
are mentioned above under “ Securing Comparable Results.” 
The teacher who has time and is willing to experiment may 
easily demonstrate the possibility of changing a score by a 
slight change in directions or by a different attitude in present- 
ing the work to children. The chief consideration, if com- 
parisons are to be made, is that the attitude, detailed directions, 
and every element entering into the giving of the test shall be 
as indicated in the directions, so that pupils in one city, or 
even in one state, may be compared with those in another. 
In handwriting, for example, pupils should be so instructed 
and handled that they will write at their natural rate, thus 
securing results in the test that will represent the normal 
situation. 
3. Scoring the Papers.—Every test provides printed 
directions for scoring the papers in order to aid teachers in 
securing uniformity of results. These printed directions 
should be followed implicitly. If the teacher has opinions 
as to what should be done, and these opinions are different 
from the directions, such opinions should be abandoned if the 
results of the test are to be used for comparative purposes. 
The teacher is urged to have the pupils aid in scoring the 
papers in so far as it is possible. This can be done very 
largely in arithmetic, in spelling, in certain reading tests, 
and, to an extent, in writing. The chief purpose of involving 
the child in the grading is to further increase his interest. 
This is an incentive and a motive which is worth while for 
teaching purposes, and which will lead the child to greater 
effort in order that he may score higher in a future test. 
4. Tabulating Results. — Directions for tabulating results 
or distributing the scores are provided in connection with 
most of the tests. A common method of making a dis- 
tribution is to arrange the papers in order. The teacher can 
s
-P-A-G-E-268
258 How to Measure 
then draw off the scores, noting the number of papers falling 
at each point. This gives the distribution. For further use, 
the teacher will need to supply the names of pupils opposite 
each score, or, in case she is noting mistakes, opposite each 
mistake. The results of any test cannot be intelligently used 
until they have been arranged in some systematic order, 
particularly if the number of pupils involved is large. 
5. Statistical Calculations and Graphic Representations. — 
The statistical points to be determined after the results of a 
test have been tabulated are usually the median, the quartiles, 
and, sometimes, the average or standard deviation. These 
points will-be_explained_in the-next-section_of_this—chapter. 
When understood, they are very valuable, particularly in 
making a comparison of one room or one school system with 
another. 
To represent the scores graphically often helps the teacher to 
see points which would otherwise remain hidden. A graphic 
representation is made by noting the number of scores falling 
at each point of the scale, and representing the number by 
the distance from the base line, and then drawing a line 
connecting all of these points. The height of the line above 
the base line enables the teacher to see at a glance just what 
is happening in her class. 
6. Interpretation of Resulis.— The teacher is warned to 
avoid conclusions until she has mastered the technique and 
the significance of the test and has given it to different groups, 
or enough times to the same group, to clear up in her own mind 
the various questions that may arisein giving the test. Especial 
care should be taken not to draw far-reaching, general con- 
clusions from a test. A test is usually devised for a specific 
purpose. The significance of the test in other fields can be 
known only through the figuring of coefficients of correlation 
after a large number of cases has accumulated. A good 
drawing of the moon by an eighth grade pupil means a good 
drawing of the moon — not an artist, not an astronomer.
-P-A-G-E-269
  Statistical Terms and Methods 250 
Nothing should be taken for granted. Mistakes will be 
avoided by caution, and fear will be eliminated by a thorough 
understanding. 
7. Applying Remedies. — The ultimate purpose of a test, 
so far as the individual teacher is concerned, is to enable her 
to see the needs of her pupils and to search out the appropriate 
remedies. The discovery of the remedy in any subject 
takes her into the question of methods of teaching, but this 
is a desirable result. To use a test for measurement only, 
without carrying the work forward to a point of use and 
application in better teaching, is to close the eyes to the 
significance of a situation after it has been revealed. The 
teacher, after giving a test, is in the position of a specialist who 
has diagnosed a bodily ailment. The diagnosis means nothing 
unless the appropriate remedy is applied. The recognition of 
this fact leads a teacher or a group of teachers, again and 
again, into the study of methods of teaching with reference 
to the subject tested. 
8. Codperation.—In a city system, the closest possible 
codperation is urged between supervisor and teachers, not 
only for the benefit of the teachers, but as well for the benefit 
of the supervisor. Codperation, understanding, and mutual 
confidence are always valuable assets, and especially so in the 
use of the tests which may reveal teacher weaknesses as 
well as pupil weaknesses. The teacher, however, will be the 
first to want to correct any revealed defects, and her interest 
and coéperation will enable the superintendent or supervisor 
to secure other important results, such as: 
a. A more scientific attitude toward school work. 
b. A closer checking of results and a realization that pupil 
errors are specific and need individual attention. 
c. Better time allotments, more definite assignments, a 
clearer conception of the objectives to be attained, and more 
efficient methods of teaching. , 
Statistical Terms. — The purpose of the statistical treat- 
 
-P-A-G-E-270
  260 How to Measure 
ment of scores is intelligent interpretation. The first step in 
the handling of scores is to give them systematic arrangement. 
A distribution is a systematic arrangement of scores. 
A table of frequency is a table showing the scale and the 
distribution of scores at each point on the scale. 
The following are the unarranged grades of seventy-seven 
sixth grade pupils in arithmetic: 34, 9% 65, 69, 76, 80, 6%, 
73, 85, 81, 79, 66, 59, 75, 76, 81, 84, J4; 55, 735 86, 75, 71, 60, 
1-92, 85, 76, 82, 50, 65, 92, 100, 81, 75, 85, 97, 65, 91, 85, 86, 
72s 55>-45>-15; 12-88 64, 95, 87, 755 15s 70, Uy 87, 85, 82, 67, 90, 81, 95, 80, 86, 80, 75, 67, 70, 72, 84, 76; 70, 88, 72, 80,aipm; 
67) 8251720 
Thus arranged, the scores have little significance. They 
need statistical interpretation. The following table of fre- 
quency shows a scale with intervals of 5, and on the right hand 
side the number of scores at each point on the scale. This 
right-hand column represents the distribution. A grade is 
recorded at the nearest “5” point on the scale, thus, 74 is 
recorded or scored at 75, 92 at go, etc.

Statistical Terms and Methods 261 
This table is much more useful than the undistributed 
grades, as it enables the teacher to see the number of pupils 
(or number of scores) at each point on the scale. 
Special significance is usually attached to certain points 
on the scale, such, for instance, as the passing mark. If 70 is 
the passing grade, the teacher sees at once that 14 of the pupils 
have failed. 
Other points on the scale that have statistical value are the 
median, the quartiles, the mode, the average; and the range. 
The median is the middle score, or the point on the scale 
above and below which an equal number of scores fall after 
the scores have been arranged into a table of frequency. In 
Table 58 there are 77 scores, so that the middle one would be 
the 39th score from either end of the distribution. The 39th 
score falls at 75, and therefore 75 is the median score. In case 
of an even number of scores, the median is the average of the 
two middle scores. 
The quartiles are the points on the scale arrived at by taking 
+ and # the scores, counting in from either end. It is usual 
to start at the bottom of the scale, so that counting up until 
4 the scores have been covered locates the point on the scale 
known as the first quartile, and the distance up the scale neces- 
sary to include ? of the scores locates the third quartile. The 
second quartile is seldom referred to as it is the same as the 
median. It is evident that the first and third quartiles are 
the points midway between the median and the extremes. 
The middle 50% is a term frequently used. It represents the 
number of scores falling between the first and third quartiles. 
The extremes are the outside limits of the distribution, 
and the distance between the extremes indicates the range of 
the distribution. 
The mode is the point on the scale where the greatest number 
of scores fall. In Table 58, the mode is 75. 
The average is found by adding the scores together, and 
dividing the sum by the number of scores.
-P-A-G-E-272
  262 How to Measure 
Deviation. — Some method of indicating by a single figure 
the deviation of the scores from some central point like the 
median is frequently used. Average deviation is most often 
used and it is found by taking the average of the deviations 
of the individual scores from some central tendency, usually 
the median. Standard deviation is also used to express devia- 
tion. It equals the square root of the sum of the squares 
of the deviations from the arithmetical average (although 
the median may be used instead of the average). 
The teacher will have little use for figuring deviation in 
the present volume. 
Correlation. — The relation between two paired series may 
be expressed by a single figure known as the coefficient of 
correlation. The figure ranges from —1 to +1, the latter 
figure representing perfect correlation or agreement. The 
work of the present volume will not require the derivation of 
this term, so the reader is referred to works listed in the bib- 
liography in case of a desire to know the method of figuring 
the coefficient of correlation.

CHAPTER XII 
THE TEACHERS’ USE OF SCALES AND STANDARDIZED TESTS 
TuE college instructor blames the high school teacher, the 
high school teacher complains of the grade teacher, each 
grade teacher above the first grade finds fault with the poor 
work of the teacher in the grade below, and the first grade 
teacher in turn is chagrined at the shortcomings of the 
home training. Must this go on indefinitely? Whose opinion 
should prevail? Is it not possible to get away from personal 
opinion to an agreed-upon consensus of opinion? May we 
not replace the constantly conflicting subjective standards 
with definitely defined objective standards? 
Present Grading System. — If 20 mechanics were sent out 
into a mill yard to cut and bring back a steel rod just long 
enough to reach from one girder to another, but were not 
given the measured distance between the girders before going, 
nor permitted to take a ruler or tape to use in selecting the 
rods, no experiment is needed to prove that each one of the 
20 rods would be different in length and no one of them would 
exactly span the distance from girder to girder except by 
chance. On the other hand if the foreman were to use a 
steel tape in measuring the width between the girders, and 
were to permit the mechanics to measure the length of the 
rods before cutting them, they would return with 20 rods 
each meeting with his approval. 
Is it possible for the school foreman, the teacher, to replace 
her subjective standard, her mere opinion, by an objective 
standard approximating the steel tape of the shop? The 
need of more accurate, objective standards in grading is

generally appreciated. The following are some of the 
evidences of such need: 
(x) There are constant complaints from teachers in upper 
grades, as indicated above, against the poor quality of work done 
in the lower grades. 
(2) There is wide variation in the distribution of grades 
among the various departments of the same school. In one 
high school, for example, 80% of the English grades were go 
or above, while only 4% of the mathematics grades were 90 
or above. In the same high school, the German teacher gave 
70% of her pupils 90 or above, while the Latin teacher gave 
only 24% of her pupils a grade of go or above. 
A recent study of college grading well illustrates this point. 
The study covered a total of 12,782 grades by 10 professors 
covering a period of 5 years. The grades given by professors 
number 1, 3, and 4 are shown herewith:

The contrast between Professor No. 1 and No. 3, who 
represent the extremes, is brought out more strongly by the 
graphic representation (see Fig. 16) than by the table. Pro- 
fessor No. 1 fails approximately one third of his students and 
then distributes the others about equally among the 5 remain- 
ing points of the scale. Quite the opposite, Professor No. 3 
gives two fifths of his students an honor grade, and then 
distributes the other grades about equally among the 5 other 
points of the scale. These figures are in the main true for 
each of the 5 years studied, without regard to the maturity of 
the students, whether they be freshmen, sophomores, juniors, 
or seniors.

A study of the distribution of the grades given by the faculty 
of any large high school or college is likely to show similar 
results, unless the problem of grading has received special 
attention. ; 
(3) There is a wide variation in the distribution of grades 
among teachers of the same department. Of 2 instructors 
in the same department 1 gave to 43% of his students the

  266 How to Measure 
grade of “excellent” and to none the grade of “ failure,” 
whereas the other gave to none of his students the grade of 
“excellent ” and to 14% the grade of “ failure.” 1 There 
must have been a few good and a few bad in each group. 
(4) The fact that pupils transferring from one school 
system to another are frequently demoted indicates that minor 
details rather than large fundamental considerations are the 
determining factors in classifying them. Since pupils are 
constantly shifting, in many schools as high as 20% being 
new to the system each year,” this is a very important item. 
In fairness to the child, as well as the school from which he 
came, it should be possible to determine his standing through 
the use of objective standards, and so place him in the proper 
grade.’ 
Differences in Grading Same Paper.—A study by Dr. 
Daniel Starch illustrates very clearly the variation among 
teachers of a single subject in grading that subject. A paper 
in English was submitted to 142 teachers of English. The 
grades varied' from 50 to 97, the passing grade being 75. 
Twenty-six of these teachers, or 18%, marked the paper a 
failure, that is, graded it below 75. On the other hand, 14

2 Typical facts with reference to the proportion of school children who leave 
school, because of leaving the city, are easily gathered from current school 
reports. The following are illustrative: 
In Waterbury, Connecticut, 1914-15, there was a total enrollment of 13,954. 
Of this number 902, or 5.4 per cent, left school during the year. Of those who 
left school, 426, or 47.2 per cent, left the city. Similar facts for other cities 
follow: 
In Des Moines, Iowa, 1913-14, 10.7 per cent left school. The proportion 
of those who left the city was 61.3 per cent. 
In Decatur, Illinois, 1913-14, 15.7 per cent left school. Of these 62.7 per 
cent left the city. 
In Connersville, Indiana, 1910-12, two years combined, 14.8 per cent left 
school. Of these 57.8 per cent left the city. 
Pupils who leave the city will usually enter other school systems.

right grades.

of the group marked it go or above, indicating that in their 
opinion it was a very superior paper. 
In mathematics, a similar test gave results that were even 
more surprising, particularly so in view of the fact that mathe- 
matics is considered one of the exact sciences. A geometry 
paper which was submitted to 118 teachers received grades 
ranging from 29 to g2, the passing mark being 75. Sixty-eight 
of the teachers, or nearly 58% of them, marked the paper a 
failure. Fifty of the group marked it 75 or above, one giving 
it a grade of g2. 
A history paper graded by 70 teachers showed similar 
variations, the grades ranging from 43 to go. 
This but illustrates the present chaos resulting from the 
lack of standards in grading an ordinary examination paper. 
When this is multiplied by the variation in sets of exam- 
ination questions, it is apparent that on the present basis of 
examinations it is absolutely impossible to compare one sys- 
tem with another, one grade with another, or to compare from 
month to month the same grade with itself. It is unnecessary 
to discuss fully the above points. Others might be added, all 
indicating the need of objective standards. 
Uniform Examination Not Satisfactory. — One may ask if 
the purposes of an objective standard for measuring school 
achievement cannot be accomplished by a uniform course of 
study, uniform examination questions, and uniform grading. 
These items may properly receive attention in order. In the 
first place a uniform course of study is undesirable. It must 
be adjusted to community demands and pupil interests. It 
should differ greatly for children from the exclusive residence 
districts of New York City, and the children from Iowa farm 
homes, To attempt to secure a rigid uniformity in the course 
of study would be deadening in the extreme. The course of 
study should be flexible and provide for local variations. 
To possess knowledge which is useful and usable is much more 
fundamental in a democracy than to strive for a large common
-P-A-G-E-278
  
268 How to Measure 
intellectual possession composed too largely of material which 
is stale and useless. 
In the second place, all will agree that there is nothing 
more baneful and stupefying in its influence than a rigid 
examination system. ( It mak subject matter the aim and 
end. \\It leads to cramming.)/\It militates against use and 
application’) | (It directs pupils Yo words in books instead of to 
life’s real problems and their solutions, And strange as it 
may seem, a standard test will accomplish the desirable results 
of a te examination system without the undesirable 
results appearing. In subjects for which standard tests are 
not available, examinations must continue to be used. They 
have a value if rightly used. 
In the third place, all will admit that uniformity of grading 
is desirable. It is difficult, however, with an ordinary 
examination, although common practice may be improved by 
adopting a 5-point system and distributing grades according 
to the normal curve of distribution. How to improve tke 
grading of a group of teachers along these lines has been well 
explained by Gray, Meyer, Dearborn, Judd, Starch, Kelly,’ 
and others. But one of the greatest advantages of the 
standard test or scale is that it greatly aids in securing uni- 
formity of results in grading. In order to standardize a test, 
specific directions have of necessity been prepared for giving 
the test and for grading the returns. All of this means greater 
uniformity in grading, and greater fairness to individual 
classes or pupils in case of comparison. In fact, a standard 
test is, in a way, a well-selected uniform examination, accom- 
panied by specific directions which greatly aid in securing 
uniformity and fairness. 
Standard Tests. — But a standard test is much more than 
1 Kelly, F. J., ““Teachers’ Marks and their Distribution.” Contributions 
to Education No. 66, Teachers College, Columbia University. This volume 
contains a good bibliography on the study of school and college marks and 
grading.
-P-A-G-E-279
  Teachers’ Use of Scales and Standardized Tests 269 
a uniform examination. The standardization of a single test 
or scale often requires a year or more of intensive work by 
one of our ablest educators. Not only must the subject 
matter be carefully selected and adapted to pupil ability, but 
it must be tried out with thousands of pupils, revised, and 
again tried out, until every detail of the test, itsadministration, 
its evaluation, and the grade or age standards, has been 
determined. Such an undertaking is too much to expect 
from the overworked teacher. But the teacher may prop- 
erly be expected to profit by the standard tests of subject 
matter which have become available. 
The difference between an examination and a standard test, 
as well as the progress of measurement in education, is fairly 
well illustrated in the attempt to measure arithmetic in the 
two Cleveland surveys, the first by a local commission in 
1906, the second by a survey committee composed of educa- 
tional experts selected from all parts of the country only nine 
years later, 1915. | 
The arithmetic test given in the first Cleveland survey 
was devised by men of maturity and judgment, but had not 
been standardized. It was not even based upon a wise selec- 
tion of subject-matter, and it could not lead to any valid con- 
clusions. It was used in at least one later survey.’ It did 
not justify further use, although it was doubtless as good as 
any test that could have been quickly devised under the 
circumstances. At the time Thorndike’s writing scale had 
just appeared but had not come into general use, and there 
were no standard tests. 
In 1915, however, the work of the Cleveland schools was 
measured in a scientific manner which carried conviction every- 
where. In writing, spelling, arithmetic, and reading, scales or 
standard tests were applied which clearly revealed the grade 
to grade progress of the pupils, made possible comparison of 
one building with another, and permitted comparison of the

-P-A-G-E-280
  270 How to Measure 
work in Cleveland with similar work in other cities through- 
out the country. 
While a particular teacher need not be greatly concerned 
about having a test that will permit comparison of the work 
in one city with the work in another, or even a comparison 
of her work with the work of other teachers in the same grade 
throughout the system in which she works, yet she should be 
concerned about the progress of the children within her own 
room. She should know the results of her work. She 
should have a device for the definite measurement of progress, 
due to a particular method, or a given time devoted to the 
work. These aims cannot be accomplished through the 
ordinary examination. They can be accomplished only 
through the use of scales and standardized tests. 
Initiating the Use of Standard Tests. — Whether the 
initiative in the use of standard tests be taken by the teacher, 
the superintendent, or a survey commission, the final result 
should be to help the teacher, and through her, the pupil. 
Miss Laura Zirbes;! of the Cleveland University School, 
took the initiative in the use of standard tests, completely 
transformed her own theory and practice, and brought new 
life and more rapid progress to her pupils. In Boston, the 
initiative came from the central office, but in such sympathetic 
and codperative form that teachers were effectively reached. 
Of more pronounced effect probably than any of these factors, 
however, was the stimulation among the Boston teachers of 
an inquiring attitude towards the whole problem of arithmetic 
instruction. “The results from the tests have shown the 
need of improvement; they have shown that the problem 
of arithmetic teaching is not yet solved, and they have 
prompted many teachers to study their own work as the first 
step towards improving methods of instruction.”? Later

an entire bulletin’ was devoted to showing teachers and 
principals how to use the results of standard tests in reaching 
individual pupils and improving instruction. 
The teacher who uses a standard test in her own room for 
the purpose of knowing her pupils or locating the weak places 
in her instruction may take pride in the fact that she is putting 
herself in line with a vast army of scientific workers in educa- 
tion. She determines the median ability of 30 pupils in a 
single grade, the distribution of ability, the points of weak- 
ness, and the remedies to apply. A principal does the same 
for the entire building; the superintendent for the entire 
school system; a state bureau for the state; and a research 
specialist, by combining city and state results, gets norms of 
performance for a nation. The teacher thus sees herself as a 
contributor in a great piece of constructive work in scientific 
education, and she may, if she wishes, locate her particular. 
group of children with reference to the thousands of other 
children throughout the county, — she may feel the thrill of 
being one of the 700,000 lieutenants who marshal the army 
of 22,000,000 American school children, in the interests of a 
safer and saner democracy. 
Uses of a Standard Test. — However, the most helpful 
point for the present purpose is that standard tests should 
be used by the individual teacher for the purpose of finding 
the weaknesses in her own work, evaluating methods, and 
definitely measuring the progress of her own pupils. It will 
be worth while to enumerate in order the uses that a teacher 
may make of a standard test. Some of these are in common 
with the uses which may be made of the results ofstandard 
tests by principals and superintendents, but many of them 
apply directly to the particular schoolroom and are in addi- 
tion to other uses. Standardized tests may be used: 
1. To determine conclusively whether or not a pupil is 
making progress. 
1 Boston, Educational Bulletin No. XIII. 
 
-P-A-G-E-282
  242 How to Measure 
2. To determine how much progress a pupil has made in 
a given time. , 
3. To determine ctr a pupil should be promoted, 
retained, or reclassified, in so far as the mastery of subject 
matter is made a condition of progress. Dr. Starch states 
that promotion on the basis of ‘measured ability would save 
one year to one third of the pupils in the public schools. 
4. To determine even more accurately whether or not the 
class is making progress and the amount of such progress. 
5. To determine whether or not a class is up to standard 
when received from another teacher. This use of the stand- 
ard test would remove the constant complaint of teachers 
that the work has not been covered in the preceding grades. 
6. To justify a year’s work with a class on the basis of 
actually measured progress. This will make it possible to 
show to a prejudiced principal or superintendent (if such 
there be) that reasonable progress has been made by a class. 
7. To show results in a manner that completely discounts 
the advantages of another teacher more attractive and popu- 
lar, in case such teacher depends upon winning promotion by 
methods not contributing to pupil progress. 
8. To detect the fact, in case more time cannot profitably 
be spent with retarded pupils. See, for example, the con- 
clusion of Superintendent Bliss of Montclair, N. J., that a 
group of subnormal pupils could not profit by further work in 
arithmetic.” 
9. To release bright pupils from further work after deter- 
mined standards have been reached, as long as said standards 
are maintained. The teacher would thus limit the work 
required along mechanical and routine lines. Rice’s articles * 
on the “Spelling Grind” over 20 years ago emphasized 
the fact of wasted youth through the schools. Over emphasis

to. To test one method against another by the amount 
of measured progress made by the pupils, e.g. textbook 
procedure versus large motivated problems, as a basis for 
developing ability in solving reasoning problems (in so far as 
devised tests adequately measure this educational product). 
It is apparent that such use of standardized tests would re- 
place the trial and error method as a means of determining 
correct procedure, and would replace it by a method much 
more scientific. 
11. To test one class plan, study plan, or administrative 
device against another, by measured results with the pupils. 
12. To determine the proper apportionment of school 
time to various subjects of study and other school activities. 
This use of standard tests has been well pointed out by Dr. 
Haggerty? 
Standard Test Saves Time. — Naturally the teacher asks, 
“But will not this scientific testing require a much larger 
time expenditure than I can give to it? I’m crowded for 
time as it is.” 
This question can be answered only on the basis of the 
experience of other teachers. That experience shows that 
after the technique is once mastered, the time required for 
standard testing is not more, but frequently less, than the 
time consumed in marking papers under the old examination 
system. After the writing scale has been used for a while, 
has been conveniently posted for reference by pupils, and has 
been explained to them, the teacher will find that a committee 
of pupils can be relied upon to grade the writing of the room, 
honestly and quite accurately. In fact each pupil will grade

vania), April, 1918, for comparison of class study and independent study in 
spelling. Reported by J. N. Adee, Superintendent Schools, Johnstown, Pa.

his own writing by comparison with the scale. After the 
spelling test has been given, pupils may be allowed to ex- 
change papers and correct them while the teacher gives the 
correct spelling of the words. Likewise in arithmetic, the 
pupils can help the teacher in quickly grading the papers. 
This help by pupils i in the simpler tests should be encouraged 
not alone because it saves the time of the teacher, but chiefly 
because it creates a desirable interest and stimulates the 
pupils to put forth a greater effort to reach a given standard. 
Standard Test a More Effective Tool.— The question 
with regard to the time required for giving standard tests is a 
legitimate one, and an effort has been made to answer it. 
Every conscientious teacher will agree, however, that time 
is not the chief consideration. She puts in a full quota of 
time each day, and will continue to do so. If she is as wise 
as conscientious, she will also provide time for sufficient 
sleep and recreation each day. The chief consideration is 
that the teacher in mastering the details of the use and inter- 
pretation of a standard test is equipping herself with a more 
effective tool of service. Why should the teacher guess and 
estimate when she can measure? The unsatisfactory nature 
of the present grading system has been dwelt upon. A grade 
of 85 in one room cannot be compared with a grade of 85 in 
another room. The present unscientific method of grading 
must be replaced by scientific procedure if we are to continue 
to make educational progress. Improvement is certainly 
hampered by the use of a system which does not even permit 
of comparison, and thus give a definite measure of progress. 
Under the old system when two schools determined to compare 
the spelling ability of their pupils, all that they could do was 
to get the pupils together and have them compete in a spelling 
match. And yet as we look back upon the spelling match 
we see that the result was finally determined by the one best 
speller. The general merit of spelling in one school as com- 
pared with the general merit in the other was not determined.
-P-A-G-E-285
Teachers’ Use of Scales and Standardized Tests 275 
Measuring a Human Product. — The teacher may insist 
that she is dealing with a delicate human product. This is 
true; and yet, as Thorndike has pointed out, mental products 
can be measured and are being measured. ‘‘ Whatever exists, 
exists in some amount.”’ The work of the physician probably 
compares as closely as any other with that of the teacher. 
We want a physician who is kind and sympathetic, but we 
are not willing that these qualities be substituted for accurate 
and adequate knowledge. Regardless of his kindness and 
sympathy, he counts the pulse, and takes the temperature. 
In case an anesthetic is to be administered, he calls in an 
expert to determine the amount and to administer it accord- 
ing to standard methods. In case of a surgical operation he 
again calls for an expert, frequently a busy, unsympathetic 
stranger. In all of this work, regardless of his kindness, 
sympathy, geniality, and his spiritual qualities in general, 
he relies upon accurate knowledge, definite measurement, and 
tested skill. He proceeds scientifically. The teacher should 
do likewise. 
“Tt is a popular superstition that human action, person- 
ality, and behavior will be penned up and hindered when 
measured by logical categories and fixed units. But, just as 
the pound weight. has not interfered with the production of 
butter, and the yardstick has not obstructed improvement in 
the manufacture of cotton or other goods, so methods of 
teaching, it may be assumed, ‘ will improve and develop 
freely, even when fixed standards are applied.’ The spirit 
can still go where it listeth. Measurement must meekly . 
follow, gather up the results, and give them a value.” 
Weights and measures call to mind definite units, such as 
pound, quart, and yard, and these are infinitely more valuable 
for commercial purposes than ‘‘as much as a man can lift,” 
“a small jar full,” or “the length of a man’s arm.” Stand- 
ards have made commercial transactions possible at great 
distances on a basis of perfect understanding and fairness.
-P-A-G-E-286
  276 How to Measure 
There is no doubt that teaching and the products of school 
work are going to be benefited in a similar manner by the 
application of definite standards of measurement. Measure- 
ment is always taking place in one form or another. School 
work is being constantly noted as good, fair, or poor, 
as satisfactory or unsatisfactory, and is constantly being 
rated by such standards as are available, be these standards 
crude or otherwise. 
Many large cities have established bureaus of measurement 
and efficiency. Each bureau has a head with an adequate 
clerical staff. Such an organization is needed in a large city 
even when the teachers administer and grade the tests. A 
central bureau can establish city standards, make valuable 
comparisons, and interpret results in a way to be most val- 
uable and helpful to all teachers as well as superintendents 
and supervisors. But more and more the directors of central 
bureaus realize that they are failing unless they reach the 
individual teachers. Dr. Ballou emphasizes this on every 
page of his recent bulletin interpreting results in arithmetic.’ 
He assures us that in the last analysis ‘“‘ the teacher must 
find out what her trouble is and then apply the remedy.” 
The present work makes no effort to discuss the complete 
list of available tests, but instead is limited to such tests as 
have been standardized sufficiently to recommend their use 
to the teacher who, for the most part, is untrained in the use 
of statistical methods. In beginning the work in measurement, 
teachers should make no effort to employ all available tests, 
but should carefully select the test to be given. As pointed 
out by Ballou, teachers will do well to give tests that are 
reasonably simple, that can be scored and tabulated with 
reasonable ease, and that have been given to a sufficient 
number of children so that well-founded standards of achieve- 
ment have been established, the first assumption always being 
that the test measures desirable phases of school products.

REPORT 
TO PE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSES 
‘ 
the Superintendent of Public Instruction, pursuant to en act of the 
general assembly entitled "an act to apnoint a Board of Common School Con 
missioners end to secure the Common Bchool Fund," bers leave to reporti~ 
That he has received of the Common Sohool Fund, at different times, 
’ mostly in paper currency, the sum of §866,7890193 of thie sum $363,189.54 
were received from the sales of Ococe lands, and the residue from other 
sovrcesse Of this residue, how:vor, $7,556029 is interest, with which he hag 
‘ghanged himself in his books, though 4n point of fact 1t was never actually 
received but ia included in notes whioh have been renewed, and which, as yet, 
have not been collected. 
He has invested in stock of the Planters Bank of Tennessee $231,700« 
Re has paid upon stock in the Union Bank of Tennessee $774— He has paid into 
the Bank of Tennessee, ag capital stock, §472,515.05% and on account of the 
sinking fund §355,229¢763 and has paid in the redemption of the Bank notes of 
the old Bank of the State, to former Bank agents, in costs of suit by and 
against said Banke to agents of the Board of Commissionerg in the different 
counties~ and for expenses in putting the Common Echool system inte operation, 
and in other disbursements, the aum of $19,396.80. He has also on hand in 
counterfeit change tickets and {n unourrent Bank paper taken by agents, $63.50 
which shows a balance against him including the aforesaid interest, of 
$107,101.08. With regard to this balance and the interest which may have 
accured thereon, amounting to this date, to about 36,000 besides, that neither 
his ~otives, nor his acts, may be misunderstood, he begs leave to state, that 
by the llth section of the aforesaid act, passed the 19th day of February, 1836, 
it 498 provided, that as "fast as the curtatlments and interest shall be paid or 
any of the School Fund shall be otherwise collected, it shall be paid by the 
county agent, or the persons collecting or having possession of the same, into 
the hands of the Superintendent of Public Instruction, who shall invest the. 
sama by subscribing for stock of the Planters Bank of Tenneence, in the name 
of the Board of Conmon School Commissionersy and who shall in like manner reinvest 
the profits as they arise on the capital stock, or deposit the sane upen the 
best terms and for the highest rate of interost ho may be able to obtain, or may 
deom imst advisable." . - 
That in the summer of 1°57, as is well known, the Banks in the State, and 
elsewhore, generall suspended specie paymentse The evils resulting from this 
suapension wre of too serious a character not to be known and felt by the whole 
comunity» One of the many consequences resulting from it, was the immediate fall 
in price of the stock of the Plenters Bank, which could have been purchased in the 
eastora narket at from $70 to $80 per share. Under suoh olrownstances, to have 
subsoribed for more of it than he did, would have been deemed impolitie and unwise. 
Where he ahd a disoretion to invest in the etook of the Planters RBenk or loan out the 
money upon the best terms he was able to obtain, he exercised it by loaning to ine 
dividuals, where it could be done in safety. From the time of the suspension of the
-P-A-G-E-3
  Banks until their reswnption of specie payments, there was no other than a 
paper currency in ordinary circulation, and the value of thia was constantly 
flucuatings The agents of the Boerd in the different counties were necessarily 
avthorised to receive current Renk paper= in reference to this, there was no 
standard of currencys What was current at one time and in one paloe was not 
so in another, or in the same place at another times 
Our om Banks would sometimes receive the paper or the Southern banks in 
deposit, and at other times refuse, sometimes they would receive it in payment 
of debts, and at other time, some of it was so depreciated, that i¢ could not 
be made available for that purposes Ih many instances, paper that was con- 
sidered current when it was received by the agente in different parts of the 
State, ceased to be so when it was paid over to the Superintendents and in 
gome instences, peper that was known to be depreciated when it wae received, 
where no other could be obtained, was taken in payment of doubtful debte. In 
consequence of which, & lerge amount of depreciated paper, or paper which was 
at a considereble discount in Nashville, was, from time to time, throw into 
the hande of the superintendents 
It was revolved by the agents, either when it was considered current or 
under suéh sircumstances that he could not reasonably avoid taking it from theme 
In thie state of things, but one alternative seemed to present itself~ either 
to keep the paper in kind, until perchance it should get better, and the Banks 
here to be willing to receive it, or get it off by a negotiation or loan on the 
best terms he could effects The former, wae thought very hasardous, because no 
one could foresve what might ne the condition of the Banks, nor how fer their. 
paper might depreciate.-- Under these circumstances, the latter was deemed most 
advisable, as well for the security, ee the increase of that porition ef the 
general fund, and was accordingly adoptede _ . 
He therefore loaned out, from time to time, such of the southern money 
as he hed which was not bankable under the necessity of this, on the beet terms, 
he was sometimes under the necessity of loening therewith a portion of current 
papers» In making these loans, he expected thet most of them would have been 
paid before the Bank of Tennessce went into operations but in consewuence of | 
the revulsion in trade, and the continued monied pressure, which has been ins 
creased mather than diminished by the resumption of special payments, he has not 
been able to make collections to any extent, but was under the necessity of ine 
stituting suite or of permitting the notes to be renewed, and many of them have 
been renewed accordingly: He however hopes that considerable collections will be 
mde in the course of this fall and winter» and has the satisfaction of believing 
that all the money thus loaned, os well under the aforesaid scotion, as otherwise, 
4s safe and well scoured, and will produce an average rate of interest of at least 
six per centum per anmum, Having pursued this policy previous to the session of 
the last General Assembly, and distinctly stated it in his report to that body, of 
the Qiet day of November 1637, as will be seen on refersnce to the journsle of the 
Bonate, page 620, and considering from their silence that it met their approbation 
he continued to pursue it, believing it best calculated to advance the objects 
for which this fund was createds
-P-A-G-E-4
The Superintendent has also received from county Common Bchool 
Commissioners, Bank stock, on which was paid §49,220, for which the Board 
have certifioates of transfer, except for 140 shares, on which was paid $14,000~ 
whish ie vaeted in the Board of Commssioners by @ decree of the Court of Chancery, 
The amount of Bank stook belonging to the Common School Fund, cone 
sists of 393 shares in the Union Bank of Tennessee, on which has been paid 
$86,494~ 2445 shares in the Planters Bank of Tennessee, on which has been paid 
$244,500 = 7 shares in the Farmers and Merchants Bank of Memphis, on which 
has been paid $700-- and there has been paid, as before states, into the Bank 
of Temessee $472,515.08 constituting so much of the capital of said Bank; and 
$35,229,76 on account of the Sinking Fund. The account of Turnpike stock in the 
‘Nashvilld, Murfroesborough and Shelbyville Turnpike ¢énfany'is $42,195.42 and 
dn the Smokey Mountain Turnpike $5,956056« . 
He would further state that 1f in the solleotion of the Common ~— . 
School Fund, from county Common School Commissioners, Bank agents, end others, — 
he has experienced moh difftoulty, not only: from the sonfused and soattered =~ 
condition of that fund, but from the peountary embarrassmente of the countrys | 
Many of the debts wore of a doubtful characters in such cases, where additional 
security could be obtained, he authorised an extension of the tims of payments — 
fn other instances, he has also granted indulgence, rather than sacrifice the 
property of the debtors A different course would have jeopardised many debts 
whioh are now seours, and in times so adverse, have oogasionsd, in many instames, 
distress and ruine The amount of outstanding debts is still considerablee In 
atout forty counties the greater portion of them, it is believed, will in time 
be collected in the remaining counties, except those which heave settled up, 
they are mostly bad or doubtfule 
  The Internal Improvement fund of some of the counties,whioh had 
been avprepriated by the General Assembly to the use of Comnon Schools, he was 
advised under the new constitution, became 5 part of the perpetual, and demanded 
it accordingly. Some of the counties voluntarily paid it over, others did note 
In one county, after paying it over, suit was Anktituted to reoover it back,’ 
which is now pending in the Supreme Court, whore it is presumed the question 
- will be finally settled. , 
He has obtained possession of some eacheated property, worth perhaps 
$1600 but he believed the interest of the Common School Fund would not be ~ 
promoted by a sale of it et presents There is other eacheated property, respecting 
whioh syite have been ordered, 
The Common School Act, passed the 24th of damary, 1638, also makes 
it the duty of the Superintendent of Public Instttution to prepare and submit to 
the Legislature, at each regular session, a report containing information relative 
to the condition of the Common Schools, the operation of the school ast, and to 
suggest such modifications and adterations as may be deemed expedient of the 
better organization of the systeme 
From the incipient and consequently imperfect organisation of the 
school system in Tenneseee, the first Anmmal Report cannot contain the amount and 
variety of information, that may be expected in subsequent reports, when the systen
-P-A-G-E-5
shall have beon tested by time and by the wisdom and experience of an intelli» 
gent commmitys Indeed little more can be commmiocated to the present Legis~ 
lature than mere preliminary measures, ~~ . , 
By the provisions of the 26th section of the Schook Act, 1% was made 
the duty of the Constables in each civil district, to hold an election on the 
first Saturday in June 1938, for the purpose of eleoting five school commissioners 
for sald district, and to certify the result of said election to the county court 
olerky Thoee olcotions were the first step in the immediate organisation of the 
Common School System in Tennessee. . oe, 
Section 27th, directed that the Commissioners so elected, after takaing an - 
oath for the faithful discharge of their duties, should preceod to emmerate the 
‘white children over eix and under sixteen years of age in their reapeotive dis~ 
triets on the last day of June 1838, and forthwith report the same to the olerk 
ef the county court, and that said clerk should transmit a certified copy thereof 
to the Superintendent on or before the first of November 1838 
The Superintendent was required to apportion the School moneya among the 
entire school or civil district in the Btete, according to the ratio of their 
scholastic population on or before the first Monday of February in 16393 and if 
from any district no report or a defective report should be reseived, he was 
directed "to ascertain by the best evidence in his power, the fects upon which 
the apportionment should depemie” It 49 evident, then, thet in the first 
apportionment, no distribution could be made to any district, until the entire 
scholastic population of the State should be ascertained, as the portion to 
which each pupil 4s entitled ms to be determined by dividing the whole distri« 
butable fund by this population. 
On the firet Monday of February, 1839, m return or only defective returns 
had been received from a sonsiderable number of districts and from some entire 
counties, although the Superintendent had written to the county court clearks for 
the reports, or in ease no reports had been made, for auch ostinates as would 
enable him to comply with the laws Thus situated, the only alternative was 
either to supply the déficiencies by conjectural and uncertain estirates of the 
scholastic population and thus make an apportionment equally conjectural and 
meertain, giving perhaps &o the reported districts too little and to the ‘ 
delinquent too much or to consider the 2lst seotion of the Bohool Act as 
directory; and that it might be departed from, should the intercsts of the School 
System requires Having advised with the Attorney General of the State and received 
from him an opinion in favor of such # course, the Superintendent was induced —- 
to defer the apvortinnrené and take additional measures to procure returns and 
estimates from the delinquent districts. He succeeded, by this means, in getting 
the requisite information from every district in the State, derived from a census 
(sonetimes informally taken) or from esti ates made by pereons residing in and 
acquainted with their respective apportionment of the School Fund than would have 
been practicable without this deleys This consideration, in connexion with the 
diffioulties consequent upon the incipient organisation of the School System 
will, it is believed, justify to the Legislature the oourse that has been pursued.
-P-A-G-E-6
) The Superintendent ooneiders it his duty to make an addition al explanation, 
relative to the apportionment that has been made, of the School Funds fhe loth 
section of the School Act makes it the duty of the Comptroller to report to the 
Sunerintendent immediately after the firet Monday in January ih each year, the exact 
amount of School morey in the Treasury subject to distributions From the report 
of the Comstroller mude in accordance with this section, 4t¢ appeared that the fund 
in the Treasury on the first Vonday of January, amounted to but $16,561e46---<«the 
anual avvropriation of $100,000 from the Bank of Tennessee, not being payable, 
according to the construotion of the charter ty the Board of Directora, till the 
fifth day of July---that being the end of the Bank yeare . 
. To have distributed this small sum amongst nearly one thousand school districts, 
containing a scholastic population of one hundred end eighty-five thousand four 
hundred and thirty-two, affording to the emallest districts leas than four dollars, 
end to few more than twenty=five dollars, (to each pupil eight oents and a fraction) 
would certainly not have met the public expectation which the Sohool Act had raised; 
and so fer from operating as wa intended as a lure to the people to contribute 
to the establishment of schools, would most probably have induced them to suspend 
their inoipient proceedings, if not abandon the system altogethers The superintendent 
believed, therefore, that he would fulfil the design of the last, and meet the 
approbation of the present Legislature, if he considered the appropriation fron 
the Bank of Tennessee as part of the fund subfeot to apportionment in 1639, and the 
more especially as it would otherwise have remained unproductive in the Bank for 
nearly six months, thus occasioning to the people, to whom it belonged, a loss of 
about three thousand dollars. It has accordingly been so considered, but it was 
judged expedient to make two distinct apportionments for this year, one of which | 
should be payable on demand, theother not t112 after the fifth day of July. Assurances 
have been received from various parts of the State, that the course pursued has 
given very general satisfaction, and was indeed the only course that would have met 
public expeotations 
To obviate the inconvenience and embarrasament arieing from the conflicting 
orovisions of the School Act and the Bank Charter, it ie respectfully suggested 
that the time of paying the appropriation from the Bank of Tennesses be accommodated to 
the time specified in the 10th section of the School Act for making the Comptroller's 
Report, in order that the eppropriation may be included in his report, and thus. 
beoome subject to distribution simultaneously with the other school monsys; in 
other words, that the appropriation from the Bank of Tennessee be made payable on 
or before the first Mondsy of Jarvary instead of the fifth of July in each years 
To accommodate the School Act to the Bank Charter vould make it necessary to amend 
several sections of the former, which should be avoided ssfar as practicable, in 
order that the people may the sooner beoome acquainted with ite provisions and 
know their duties and their privilegese : 
The first scholastic year in the Comnon Sohool System of Tennessee, extends 
from the firat of July, 1888, to the first of July, 1839, and the commissioners 
are required to make their School Reports for thie year, to the clerks of the county 
courts between the first of July and the first of October) but the olerks of the 
county courts are allowed from the first of October to the first of December to 
report to the Superintendents fhe present Anmal Report camet, therefore, exhibit,
-P-A-G-E-7
as the law requires, particular information with respect to the Common Schools, 
the number that have been organized, the number of pupils that heve been taught, 
the subjects taught, the amount of money paid to teachers, &e+, e11 which will of 
course be included in subsequent Reporte. The Superintendent is, however, happy 
to agsure the Legislature that he has learned unofficially that a very considers- 
ble number of schools have been established and under highly flattering auspices; 
and that in hie correspondence with Common School Officers in different parte of 
the State, he has discovered a deep and increasing interest in the couse of education 
and a confidence that the present system will lead to great and lasting resulta. 
There are in Tennessee seventy-one counties, containing nine hundred ané © 
sighty-seven civil districts, which are also recognized in the School act as School 
DPistriote. In nine hundred and eleven of theee districts, commissioners were elected 
at the time specified by law, and having qualified, proceeded to take the required 
census in their respective districts and reported the same to the county sourt 
clerks, who tranemitted certified copies of these reports to the Superintendent» 
In seventy-six districts, either no commissioners were elected or those elected 
refused to serve, or owing to some informality or defect in the proceedings, the 
elections were deemed invalid. As nearly as could be ascertained from the reports 
and from estimates made by persons residing in the delinquent districts, there were 
in the State on the last day of June, 1638, one hundred and eighty five thousand 
four hundred and thirty-two children over six and under sixteen yeers of ages In 
Gibson, Perry, Tipton, Weakley, Cannon, Coffee, Hiolman, Jackson, Overton, Smith, 
Riedsoe, Bradley, Carter, Jefferson, Johnson, Marion, Meigs, Monroe, Rhea, White, 
Yiarren, and Franklin counties, every district was reported in due form and within 
the time specified by laws In sevier, Roane, HoMimn, nox, Grainger, Cooke, Blount, 
Rutherford, Montgomery, Lawrence, Dickson, Bedford, Henderson, Carroll and Benton 
onmnties, every district vas in like manner reported but one in each eoumbye 
, The counties in the State of Tennessee are sub-divided into sections, 
called olvil districts, the maxirum number being tventy- five and the minimm number, 
eight. It ws deemed expedient by the last Legialature to adopt these existing and 
known divistons as School Dietricts and accommodate the School System to thems 
This, it was thought, would render the organization easier and more expeditious, 
and would thus compens:te for the inconveniences, that might be expected to arise from 
the size and figure of the oivil districts. No reports having been received from ‘ 
the Commissioners respecting the condition of Common Schoole, for the reasons before 
stated, the Superintendent is not prepared to say what diffioulties the School 
Syatem may have encountered from this souroe, or what may be the wishes of the 
people in reference thereto. Some, perhaps moat, of the districte will be found 
Anoonveniently larges but there is nothing in the School Act, prohibiting the esq 
tablishment of a pluralitycof schools in the same district; and in the last clause 
of the 20th section, it 1s expressly provided that a teacher may be directed by 
the Commissioners to appropriate his time attwo or more places in a district as 
the convenience and interest of the citizens thereof may require. By this arrange- 
mont, the services of a good teacher may be obtained for more than three months 
‘dn a year in each of three schools in the same districts and three months’ good 
instruction, it will readily be conceded, is worth more than twelve montha! ine 
different, and than any amount of bad teachings
-P-A-G-E-8
In connexion with this subject, a suggestion, which has been mais 
4n another State, is deemed worthy of considerations It is by no means une 
common, and ia attended with but little inoonvenience, for larger pupils to 
go two, three, or even more miles, to schoole In most oases, there fore, a 
good school, at or near the centre of a district, would be an adequate provision 
for this description of our scholastio populations The emaller shildren oould 
be vrovided for by schools established at points remote from the centre, which 
might be taught by females, or by male teachers, whose services sould be pro= 
evred at a comparatively emall compensation. An additional advantage resulting 
from this arrangement, would be a gradation of schools, at least schools of 
two prades---one where the elements and first branches of education sould be 
taugiit, and another where instruction could be carried on to any extent the 
oltizens of the district might require---thus affording the facilities and ade 
vantages resulting from a division of labor, and from a separation of pupils 
_ whose ages and studies are incompatible. 
Should there be any distriots that are inconveniently small, which 
4% fe believed will seldom be the case, or should there be some in which the 
thinness of the population would render it impracticable or onerous to support 
seperate schools, the 20th section provides that two or more districts may 
unite their funds and employ a teacher, who shall divide his tise between the 
districte in such manner as the commissioners of the distriote entering into 
the oopartnership, may agree upon, provided a sdhool be kept in each district 
three months in a yeare 
If there be districts of very irregular shapes, as where the popu~ 
lation ohiefly follows the water courses and the districts have been made to 
conform thereto, the school act does not prohibit the commissioners of any 
two adjoining districts from making an arrangement for their mutual acconmo- 
dation, by receiving the children of one distriot inte the schoola of another, 
should convenience require, provided they be always reported from the district 
in which they resides 
If these considerations and suggestions are just, it would seem to 
be inexoedient to make any change for the present in the existing sohool districts. 
A emall sacrifice of oonvenience may be compensated by the advantages arising 
from permanent geograp' ical limits. No change indeed, it is conceived, should 
be made in any part of the system that will be of doubtful utilitys 
_ The subject of school houses is intimately oonnected with that of 
school districtse So important did 4t appear to the superintendent that the 
attention of the public and especially of the commissioners, should be early 
called to this matter, that he published in January last, in connexion with 
the school act and instructions, a report on the construction of school houses, 
taken from the Ohio Common School Director, and sent a copy thereof to every 
commissioner in the States 
The law provides for the education of ohildren over six and under 
sixteen years; the scholastic age of our population, therefore, extends through 
nine years, and these too doubtless the most impressible of any equal period 
of time in a man's life, and constituting indeed no inoonsiderable portion of 
the sum total of ordinary human existences It 1a highly important, then, for
-P-A-G-E-9
the individual happiness of the pupils, that these years should be epent as 
pleasantly and profitably as nossible; but this importance 4a greatly enhanced, 
when it is considered that it 1s within this period the elements of good or 
bad citizenship are to be acquireds that the bias then given to the boy will, 
in a great degree, guide and control the man through all his subsequent lifes. 
The influence of external causes upon the minds and hearts of grown persons 
4s a fact thot needs no demonstrations how much more susceptible of svoh ine 
fluence are the uoung, who act, in a great degree, from impulse, and who, from 
the immaturity of their reason, are less capatle of discriminating between — 
right and wrong, and thus become emphatically the oreatures of oireunstances. 
It 1s evident that the more comfortable and attractive a school 
house ig made, the more willingly will ohildren resort to it and be inolined 
to avail themselves of the advantages that may be proffered theme The follow 
ing very judicious remarks are from a report of an Assooiation of Teachers in 
' Easex county, Massachusetts. "The pain and uneasiness, which w ohild experiences 
from an uncomfortable situation in school, he will very likely assoolate with 
his books and studies, or with the instructor and regulations of schools he 
may corneot it with those who ait near him, and who may be just aa uneasy a8 
himself, and be ready to hate the whole and quarrell with all, because he feels 
pain and cannot or does not rightly understand the occasion of ite The local 
situation of children in achonl has a most obvious bearing upon the conduct and 
tempers Place them a little out of the observation of the instructor, and : 
they will play; put them where they are crowded, or sit with inconvenience, 
and they will quarrel.-~<Suppose from one of the causes above named, the ohild 
aoguires a habit of loose and foolish playfulness or of restless Aisoontent«o<= 
suppose he acquire a disrelish for schools, his books, or unking feelings - 
towards his instructor or his fellows---will there not te much personal loss, 
and ig there no denger of future consequences--i8 there no danger that these 
feolings will go into future life, and the individual prove less comfortable 
to himself, and less comfortable to others? Youth is the season when the 
character is formed and direction given to the feelings and conducts It is 
a matter of no small interest to the man himself or those with whom he is to 
act in future life, that these be of a gontle and accommodating characters” 
A very important duty of the sohool commissioners and eapecially 
those of the first years of the school system, will consist then in the proper 
location snd construction of school houses---that they may heve a pleasant 
and retired situation near to waters be of the proper size and form, and furnished 
with oonvenient and comfortable desks and tables; be properly lighted, warn- 
ed and ventilateds and have an agreeable appearance externally and. internally) 
that a suitable playground be provided for the amusement and exereise of the 
pupiles and then that the cormissioners and tesohers see to it that the whole 
be kept neat, clean and in good repaire “What,” says Mr« Mann, Secretary of 
the Board of Education in Massachusetts, speaking of school houseg, "what 
external appearnace could impress strangers from other states or countries, as 
they passed through our borders, with such high and demonstrative proffs that 
they were in the midat of a people, who, by forecasting the truest welfare of 
their children, meant nobly to seek for honor in the character of their posterity, 
rather than meanly to be satisfied with that of their ancestors? And how different 
_ would be the feelings of a11 children towards the schools and through the sohoole, 
towards 011 other means of elevation and improvement, if from their earliest 
gaye, of observation, they were accustomed always to look at the séhool house ane hear spoken of as among the most attractive objects in the neighbors 00 .
-P-A-G-E-10
) When it 4s considered that a school house, constructed of proper materials, 
will, with care, endure for several scholastio generations, the means necessary to 
make it of the proper size and style, and to furnish it in @ convenient and com 
fortable manner, should be cheerfully and amply provided. In Ghio, it has been 
recommended that, under. certain repulationa and restrictions, he privilege shall 
be given to the school districts, of borrowing money from the Etate for the ereotion 
of school houses, the interest of rhich should be paid annvally by mesna of a tax 
levied on the borrowing district end collected a+ the same time with the other 
State taxesy the suma thus borroved to be repaid in convenient instalmentas 
It might be argued in favor of such a course, that the objest to be ob= . 
tained is one of greatest magnitude and will consequently justify a lerge expendi- 
ture of money) and that as the next generation will, it may be presumed, be at least 
equally benefited vy the measure, they ought to share the burden equallys This 
measure, the Superintendent would merely mention, as a suggestion that has been 
made in a sister State, and as indicating the important bearing which the providing 
of good school houses ia there considered to have upon the success of Common Sohools, 
. Another means has been suggested by the commissioners in several of the 
districts, for encouraging the srection of good school hovses, which is respect= 
fully recommended to the favor of the Legislatures to permit such districts as may 
be uhable or unwilling otherwise to build school houses of the proper kind, te use, 
for this purpose, their portion of the School Fund in whole or intparte This will 
absorb their funds only for the year in which the house i¢ erected, after which they 
will te prepared to expend them on the proper business of teachings 
Believing that the subject of school house architecture is one of great 
Amoortance to the health and happiness, to the moral, physical and intellectual 
culture of the rising and future generations, and presuming that information respecting 
it will be aoceptable,and profitable at the present early period of Common Schools 
in Tennessee, the Superintendent has given in the Appendix to thia report three 
plans of school hovaes, which have been tried and approved in other Statese 
In section 17th of the Sohool Act, it is required that a sohool be kept 
at least three vonths by a "qualified teacher" in order to entitle a district to 
4ts share of the public funds but the act nowhere specifies what his qualifications 
shall be or who are to judge concerning them. It is respeotfully suggested that this 
omission in the Act be supplied, by giving to the commissioners the power and making 
4t their duty to examine teachers and give certificates to suoh as shall be found 
to possess proper morel and intellectual qualifications). Good teachers, it will 
readily be conceded, are essential to the success of any system of schools; no 
practicable means, therefore, of securing them should be neglected. "“Althovgh it 
4e not always in the power of school committces to introduce into the achools dev~ ~ 
oted and accomplishod teachers; yet it 18 in their power and it ie a solemn part of 
their duty, not to inflict upon the children of a whole district, the calamity of 
an ignorant, ill-tempered and profane teacher. It 18 no trivial arbitrament, to 
decide whether a school shall be a blessing or a nuisance, and therefore the question 
of 8 wens fitness i@ not to be guossed at, but solemnly ponderede® (Mann's 
eporve : 
It is evident from the provisions of the School Act, thet the most im=- 
portant duties it imposes, rest upon the commissioners. They are required to take 
she census of the scholastic population every year and report the same forthwith
-P-A-G-E-11
to the county olerky to procure or locate and build school houses, and have the 
custody of the samey to employ, pay, advise, direct, and if necessary, dismiss * 
the teachers; to visit and inspect the sahoole at least once a months to inspect 
the Tesohers's Registers and from them make out a Rate Billy and to make a report 
every year to the county oourt clerk, containing a great variety and amount of 
information reapecting the state of the schools; and to failure in discharging 
certain of these duties, considerable penalties are attached, For the performance 
of these duties; and for assuming these responsibilities, no compensation or 
imumity is allowed. To this ceuse may be mainly attributed the fact that in 
sixty-one of the soventy~six delinquent distriota, the commiasioners, after being 
elected, refvsed to serves : 
It 1s respectfully submitted, then, whether 1t is is just to impose upon a 
body of men, so large an expense of time and labor without some remuneration, either 
te a ver diem allowance or an irmunity, in whole or in part, from state, county or 
district taxations and whether it is reasonable to expect that the duties will be: 
performed, or at least verformed as they ought to be, without auch inducement? “It: 
ds the part of widsom to borrow light from the experience of other States, in which 
the school system has been in operation for yearas "In not more than fifty or sixty: 
towns, W says Mr. Mann, "out of the three hundred and five in Massachusetts, haa there 
been any pretence of a compliance with the lew," requiring the school committees to vieit 
and inspect the schools." It would be unjust, he adds, to attribute the omission | 
even of the important duty to any peculiar deadness of dormancy on the part of com 
mittees, towardd the great interest of Common Schoolss No body of men in the com= 
munity have performed services for the public at all comparable to theirs, for so 
little of the common inducements of honor and emoluments Were a compensation allowed 
the school committees for the dischrage of their laborious and influential duties 
there would then be justice and propriety, certainly in cases of gross delinquency, 
in subjecting them to legal animadversions or withholding from their respective 
towns their share of the annual apportionment."     
  Sections 16th end 17th of the School Act prohibit the apportionment of school 
money to any district from which no sufficient anmal return shall have been re~ 
ceived for the year ending on the last day of Jume imodiately pressding the appore 
tionment, and in which a sohool has not been kept at leadt three months during the 
year ending on the same days Section 18th suspends the operation of these two 
sections for the firat apportionment. It 18 respectfully suggested that this sus- 
p ension be extended also the second apportionment of school moneyss The olerks of 
the county courts are required to transmit to the Superintendent copies of the com- 
missioners reporta betwoen the first of October and the first of December; but these 
reports, as has been before stated, are dated the first of July and extend over the 
year year preceding said date. It ia to be expected, then, in Tenneasee, as has - 
been the case in other States, that in the first scholastic year, there will be a 
large number of districts, even of those that may have taken the incipient steps in 
the organization of the school system, which, from the want of teachers or of sohool 
houses, neglect or inexverience of commissioners or other causes, will not have 
compiled with the law, requiring a mhool ot be kept three months in the years The 
seventy six distriots, therefore, above mentioned, and all of the other districts 
that shall be found above mentioned, and all of the other districts that shall be 
found delinquent, either in respect to their reports or keeping schoole for the 
specified time of three months, will be excluded from the benefits of the next 
apportiormment (in February 1840) unless the 16th and 17th sections be rendered 
inpperative for enother scholastic yeare :
-P-A-G-E-12
To out off so large a number of districts in the epportionnent of the Sohool 
Fund, would bave a very disgouraping tendency and might, in certain cases, be 
attended with much injuetice. 
The School Fund, which has been provided by years of judiolous legislation, 
when compared with our population, 18 perhaps equal to that of any State in 
the Union, with the exception of Connectiout, and must be considered a highly 
important auxiliary in the operation of the School Systeme Sut a reference 
to the apportionment, accompanying this report, will show that it is in itself 
wholly inadequate to complete success, without additions from some other sources 
This, the law, in @omo degree provides for by the operation of the Rate Bill, 
which gives the comuesioners the power, when the dividend, ecoruing to their 
district, is insuffictent to pay the teacsherte wages, to collcot the residue 
fron parents, fvuardians and others sending children to achoole It ia not prow 
posod to disturb the operation of the Rate Bill; thia residuary power ia very 
properly conferred upon the cormisaioners, and may be made to serve a very 
anlutery purpose. It is respectfully submitted, however, whether it would 
not have a beneficial influence, without being at all onerous, to require the 
districts to raise, by a tex on property, a sum of money equal to the portion 
of the School Fund to which they are respectively entitled. This would create 
"a powerful motive to that oareful supervision, which ie one of the mist efficient 
sefeguerds apainst abuse, on the one hand, and negligence on the other." The 
people, having mixed a potion of their om money with that arising from the 
public fund, will be disposed to exeroiae a salutary jealousy in regard to the 
expenditure of the whole.. The adoption of this principle in the New York eystem 
of education, is said to have infused into ti an efficiency, which it had never 
pefore exhibited. In 1837 it was recommended to make the requisition from the 
people in that Strte, once and a half the amount annually distributed from the 
School Funde 
The money thus raised, should not be Loéked upon as a tax, but rather 
as the nost economical provision for a necessary expenditures It may be asaumed - 
that every child in the community should be educated cither in private or in 
public schoola; and it has been found by experiment in other States, that the 
Jatter ray afford inatruotion equally as good ag the former and at leas than 
half the expenses. In the publio schools of Boston the cost of tuition is about 
ten dollars per scholar; in the private schoole twenty-five dollars; in Cinoin~ 
nati the propertion is as six dollars to simteens in New York as seven dollars. 
to twonty-fivee In the operation of Rate Bill, the rich man, having no ohildren 
or sending his children to a private school, i# exempt from all contribution 
to the Common School Fundy but in the proposed amendment, requiring a district 
to raise doller for déllar, the rich will be made to give in proportion to their 
property and of course will mainly bear the burden, while the poor will be 
comparatively exempt. By this addition to the fund, it ie believed that,sin 
most cases, the public schools may be rendered @o much evperior to the provate 
ones, as to supersede then, and thus break down the distinotion between the 
ohildren of the rich and the poor, by throwing them together into little commune 
ities, where corrion studies and common amusements, will create mitual and lasting 
attachnents, that may counteract the “alienating competitions of manhoode™ 
Should this measure be adopted, it will only be nesessary to give the county 
court power to levy the requisite tax at the same time the other county taxes are 
levieds and amend the 19th saction of the School Act so at to make it the duty of © 
the clerk to lay a copy of the Superintendent's report for ‘his oounty before 
the oounty courte
-P-A-G-E-13
No provision is made inthe Act for the filling of vacancies in the 
Boards of School Conmissionerse The number being but five in each district, 
and their duties various and important, one or two vacancies, as the districts 
are large, might be attended with much inconvenience and detrimente Would it 
not be advisable, then, so to amend the 13th article of the 28th section as to 
give to the Commissioners power to fill all vacancies in their boards? 
There being no Post Office tn many of the Sohool Districte, the Superintend- 
ent has been under the necessity of sending the copies of the School] Ast, designed 
for the Cormiseloners, to the county court clerke and of requesting them to 
distribute them, This request has been promptly complied with, in most oases; but 
4n others, has been neglected. It 1s recommended, therefore, that it be made the 
duty of the olerks of the county courts, to distribute all documente and comuni- 
cations, forwarded to their care, for the districts in their respective countiess 
It ie also suggested that the 80th section be so amended as to require the 
_ males and females to be distinguished in the Commissioner's reportey ‘ 
The greatest impediments to the Common School System in other State, have 
been found te arise from apathy and a want of information as to the best Wiys and 
means of orgonizing and sustaining achools. To obviate these, it ia respectfully 
suggested thats q , 2 
  First, That one or more agents be appointed, $9: fyavel through the State one 
or oftener a year, and deliver lectures; to vieit th feeHools that are already es- 
tablished, and to counsel and advise the Commissioners in the establishment of others. 
The great advantages that would result from this measure, it 1s conceived, would 
more than justify the expense of such an agent for euoh of the threa grand die 
visions @f the State, as has been proved by experiment din Massachusetts and else-~ 
whores the agent or agents to be appointed by the governor and superintendent or such 
other persons as the Legislature may deem most advisable. This measure has been 
suggested and strongly recommended by Commissioners and others residing in different 
perts of the states 
Secondly: That the Superintendent be authorised to publish, during the two 
ensuing years, © periodical, say every six months, during for the purpose of com 
municating to the Commissioners and others, information relative to Common Schools 
dn other states and coubries, with such suggestions and instructions as may be 
caloulated to promote the great cause of education in Tennessee. Any expense 
necessary to secure to the great body of the people, the blessings or moral and 
Antellectual culture, it is confidently believe, the Legislature will consider a 
matter of secondary considerations This expedient, it may be stated, has been 
adopted in the Stete of Ohio with very happy resultss 
The Superintendent of Public Instruction does not consider himself called 
upon to determine, whether Common Schools are more or less important than Acaq 
femies or Colleges, to the development of the moral and intellectual faculties of the 
community}‘anéc in in the present intellectual condition of Tennessee, if not 
heretofore, thetr existence and operation should be simultancouse That each will 
contribute, moreover, to foster and sustain the others, 4s evident; as the Common 
School will furnish pupils for the Academy, and the Academy for the Colleges while 
4n reverse order, the College will send out teachers for the Anadery and the 
Academy for the Coivhon Schools If these views be just, the principle of the bill 
enacted at the last Legislature of Tennessee for the promotion of education, 4s the 
correct onés Whether it has properly apportioned its munifencey whether it has given
-P-A-G-E-14
too moh to one desoription of institutions of learning and too little to 
another, he will not preaumo to determine, but will merely affirm, without 
fear or rational contradiction, that no sum, be it millions, that may be necessary 
to secure a sound and thorough education of the entire masa of the people, in . 
the several degrees that ere practicable, should be withheld, though it were 
necessary to oreate a great atate debt tomise this suns . 
The Superintendent would take the liberty to express his firm conviction | 
that the education demanded by the goniua of our Republican Institutions, end = 
which alone can nrove conservative of them, muet consist of moral and religious 
Anstruction superadded to intelleotucal cultures The startling and monitory 
discovery has been made in France, that most orimes are conmmitteed in the De« 
partments where there is most intelligences That the reverse of this 4s true 
in our country, 1s to be ascribed partly to impressions made within the walls 
of the school houses but chiefly, it 1s presumed, to the restraining and corrective 
influences of religion whioh happily for us, eo generally pervade the great mass 
of the peoples There can, however, be but little doubt, that there te great need 
of daily moral and religious instruction in most of our schools, which, it {1 
hoped, the wisdom of the Commissioners and the imperative voice of a virtuoull 
telligent community, will gradually supplyes 
In closing his Report, the Superintendent would congratulate the Legie~ 
lature on the favorable begimiing that has been made, in the organisation of 
the Common Bohool System in Tennessee. Under the fostering care of the present 
and future Legislatures and the patient and presevering co-operation of their 
fellow-citisens, with the blessing of en over-ruling Providense on their efforts, 
he confidently believes, that the great enterprise will wltinately be crowned 
with successes ,

The 
ATTORWEY GENERAL'S OPINION 
>, * 
I. The elections mat be held at the time and place, and by the persons 
named in the law,----otherwise they are voide . 
If any moneys are paid to persons claiming to be Commissioners, elected 
otherwise than as directed by law, it will be entirely on the personal responsi- 
bility of the offioer paying theme 
Very important powers are entrusted to the Cormissionora, and those powers 
oannot be exeroised by any excopt such as have been chosen by the people, and 
the poople have no rirht to choose Commiseloners except as in the manner pre- 
scribed by lawe The directions of the law must be etriotly pursued. If they 
may be disregarded in any particular, they may in alls and the consequence would 
be, thot the Commis ioners would sometimes be nominated not by the people of the 
districts, but by some junto in a corners 
11. The law acems to have omitted any provision for supplying vacancies 
in the office of Commissioners The only remedy for this is to lay the subjeot 
before the Legiaslaturoe A Commissioner appointed either without authority of 
law, or contrary to the method pointed out by law, is no Commissioners 
lite The firat distribution rust be made on or before the first Monday in 
February, 1339. (Sections 2, 21.) 
Nevertholess, if the Superintendent cannot be prepared on that dey to make 
the distribution, ho may make it afterwards, and it will be good. These parts 
of the law sro diroctorye 
If the Superintendent has not received the reports contemplated by the 
27th section, he will then take the justices! districts, according to section 
25, as school districts, and ascertain the nuvber of children in thom, as directed 
in the 4th section and make the distribution accordingly 
Sections 16, 17 and 18 will apply to the distribution to be made on the firet 
Yonday of February, 1840. The first distribution, (in 1889,) t# unconditionale 
IVe If the reports, directed by section 27, have not been made, the Clerke | 
' ought to report the fact, in order that the Superintendent may know that it ‘ 
will be necessary for hin to make the inquiries directed, in that event, by the 
4th sections

It 48 supnosed ty some, that in very high latitudes blindness is more 
frequent than in the tenerate sones, on account of the strong reflection of 
the sun's rays by the snows but besides thot we have no atetistical returns 
t> confirm thia opinion, there are other causes wich make it doubtfuls the 
soler rays are moh less powerful, fhe days are short, and the tendency to 
local or general inflanmations and congestions of blood, {8 much lesa in cdld - 
than in warm olimates. Without, however, dwelling upon general rules, I will 
come at once to causes operating in our own olimates 
Any one, who has reflected that man was created with a perfect physical 
organization~--that his eye, the noblest organ of sense, was fitted to reach 
to a distant star, or to examine the texture of the gossamer's web, will be 
struck by the fact, that every tenth man he meets is either near-sighted, or 
far-sighted, or weak-eyed, or has some affectation or other of the visions Now, 
the frequency of this departure from the natural state of the vision, is not 
a fortitous clrommstanoe; if there were but a single case, 1t must be referrible 
to a particular eanses and, a fortiori, when it prevails in every seotion of 
the country, and in every generation. Let us consider the greatest derange- 
_ ment of vision---blindness; there are very few cases, where the eye is totally 
insensible to Lichty let vs call ever’ person blind, whose organ of vision i8 
8) permanently deranged, that he cannot distinguish the nails upon his fingers; 
for rany persons can see how van: fingers are held up between the eve and a 
strone Light, tho cannot sce the nails. Of persons blind to thie degree, and 
of those totally blind, there are abort one in 200 in the United States. This 
calonlation is warrented by statistical returns, which is liatle to orror, only 
in putting dorn too fears 
Nf these 6500 persors, Sut very fer lose their vieion bv wounds, injuries, 
or acute inflarmations the great majority are blind in consequence of violation 
of the naturla laws, either by themselvos or their parents; fir I hold it to 
be indisputable, that almost every case of congenital blindneas, is tre penalty 
paid by the sufferer for the fault of the parent or progenitors The number 
of cases of hereditary blindness, and of hereditary tendency to diseases of 
the eye, which have come under my observation, have established this peyohd 
all doubt in my minde 
I have known reny cases, where a parent, with defective vision, haa had 
half his ot4ldren blind; and one cage, where both parents had defective vision, 
and all their children, SEVEN IN NUMBER, were blinds 
There are, then, cavses at work in our own community, which destroy the 
‘ wision of 1/8CCOth part of our population, and impair the vision of a much greater 
parts; end althorch each individual thinks himself secure, and attributes the 
blindness, or defective vision of his neighbor, to some accidental or peouliar 
elroumstance, fron which he himself enjove immunity, yet the cause will certainly 
have its effects; the violation of the natural laws cust have théir penalty and 
their victim---as a tall, stot into a dense crowd, must hit somebody It ts 
in@WBoent, thon, upon each one, in his individual capacity, to avoid the renote 
and predisposing, as well as the inmediate causes of impaired visions and it 
ia incumzent on those, who heve an inflvence upon the condition and regulations 
of socloty, to use that inflnerce for the same ends 
It vould lead ta tedinus details, to consider the variaque modea in which 
each Individual or ench osrent shonld guard against the impairment of visions 
but there are somo vious daygers to wiich children are exposed in achovls, — 
which mar be vointed ont in a fer words.

You will often see a class of children reading or writing with the sun 
shining on their books, or writing in a dark afternoon with their tacks to the 
window, and their bodies obstructing ite little lights and if you tell the master 
he is perdlling the eyesight of his scholars, he thinks he gives you a complete 
diecomfiture, by saving, that he has kept school so for ton veara, and never 
knew a boy to become blinds nevertheless, it is a cause of evil, and so surely 
as it exists it will be followed by its effect. , , 
A boy reading ty trilight, or bo the blaze of a fire, or by moonlight 
even, will tell yon he does not feel tre effects; nevertheless, they follow 
ne closely as the shador non the substances and if ten years afterwards, you 
see the hoy selecting rlasees at an opticien'a, and ask him what caused his 
imperfect vision, he will tell vor thet there was no particular causes that 
4s, the emowet of ovil done at any partioular time, was not perceptible---as 
a tover, whose system ia tottering to ruin, cannot believe that any particular 
glass of brandy ever did him any harme 
We should never read but in the erect posture, we should never read when 
the arterial system is in a state of high actions we should never read with 
too mush or too little light: we should never read with a darzling light of the 
sun, or fire, striking on our faces 
Sohorlerooms should be arranged in such a manner, that the Light of the 
aun oan be admitted in tho right direction~--not dagzling the eyes, but striking 
upon the books; there should be facilities for admitting the light fully in 
dark weather, and for excluding it partly when the sun shinee brilliantlyes 
I believe an at ention to the physiology and laws of vision, by parents 
and inetructora, would be of creat benefit to children, and diminish the number 
of opticians; for as surely as a stone thrown up will come down, 80 surely 
does exposyre to causes of ovil, bring the evil, at some time, in some way, upon 
somebodye

A light green is perhaps the test color for the scholara’ deaks and seats, 
as it is more grateful than any other to the eyes For the outside of the house, 
white is the color most universally pleasings : 
(Note. It is earnestly hoped that no new School-house will be erected in 
the country, without a careful inquiry, thether a division and gradation of the 
schools, a: surgested in these peges, be not pracitoakle. 
If a union of different Districts for this purpose, be really impossible, 
then, if the sohool large, or likely soon to become 80, there should be a 
sererate apartment for the smaller scholarse This may be effected either by 
having a basement story under the whole or a part of the principal schoole 
room, or by extending the Plan, as represented in Plate I, and having the doors 
and entries in the centre, with a room on each side, inatead of having them, 
as in the Plan, at the end of the buildings)

PLAN OF A VILLAGE SCHOOL@MOUSE 
(This is the Plan submitted to the American Institute of Instruction, by their 
Toard of Censors, 4n 1831, and ie the same referred to in the reporte) 
"Plate II is the ground plan of # village sohool-house, for both sexes, con~ 
taining eighty separate seats and desks Additional seats for small children, who 
may not require deaks, can be introduced at pleasure, and the teacher can ar 
them in such situation as may be most oonvenients For this purpose @ sufficient 
number of light, moveable forms should be furnisheds 
"the whole edifice, exclusive of the portico in front---which may be omitted, 
4f a cheap, rather than a tasteful building is reqvired,---is 68 feet long, and 
35 feot widee The dimensions of the school-room allow 21 feet of floor to each 
of eiphty scholars, the passages, the teacher's platform, &06 being included. It is 
believed thet this allowance is not too liberal,---48 not more than is required 
for the eonfort, health and improvement of the soholarse® 
——— "the plan here proposed may be enlarged or diminished, for a greater or less 
number of scholars, according to the following sealet---For ten scholars, add 4 
feot to the lengths for sixteen scholars, add 4 feet to the widths for twenty-eight 
scholars, a d 4 feot tn both length and widthe For a leas number of scholars, the 
length or brendth, or both, may bo diminished at the same rates 
"the schooleroom, represented in the plan annexed, ia ¢8 feet long, and 55 
feet wide, within the walle . 
"The floor of the room should bo level, and not an inolinod planes Nothing 
1s gained by the common mode of finishing scho7l rooms with inclined floors; and 
much ie lost in symmetry, oonvenionce and oonforte A faithful and active teacher 
will be about among his scholars, and not confine himself to a fixed seat, however 
favorably situated for over=looking theme 
"whether thore be a stove in the schooleroom or not, there ought to be an. 
open fire=place, where children may warm and dry their feet. The fire-place should 
be furnished with a hot-air chamber, to facilitate the ventilation of the roome 
"The lids or tops of the scholars! desks are usually mado to slopes too mohe 
They should be nearly, if not quite horizontal,---an inch to a foot being & suffieient 
slopes 
"gach scholar should have a separate seat, which should be confined to the floor. 
The seat should be about 13 inches squaree ~ 
"the front rows of seats and desks, or those nearest the master's platform, 
being designed for the amaller children, should bo lower than those near the entries.” 
*"It may not be amiss to state, that two of the Consors teach large private 
schools in Rostons and in their respective schools, they allow for each of their 
scholars, atont 22 square feet of floor, exclusive of entries, drossing-rooms, 
reoitation=-rooms, &6. One of the school-rooms is 16 and the other 18 feet high,

Appendix 
(a) 
Letter from Pr. Samuel P. Woodward, Superintendent of the State Lunatio 
Hospital at Worcestere oy 
  Worcester, March 14, 1638 
Hons Horace Menn, Secretary of the Board of Educations 
Dear Sire Your note and queries, respecting the construction of school-houses, 
cams to hand yesterdays I improve the earliest opportunity to replys 
First, as to the 411 effects of high and narrow benches, and seats without 
backs. 
High and narrow seats are not only oxtremely uncomfortable for the young 
scholar, tending constantly to make him restless and noisy, distrubring his 
temper end preventing his attention to his books, but they also have a a direct 
tendency to produce deformity of the limbs. . 
If the seat 16 too narrow, half the thigh only reste upon it; if too high, 
the feet cannot reach the floors the consequence is that the limbs are suspend= 
ed on the oentre of the thirh.e Now, as the limbs of children are pliable 
or flewible, they are easily made to grow ovt of shape and become crooked 
by such an arkward and unnatural position. . 
Seats without backs have an equally unfavorable influence upon the spinal 
oolum, If no rest is afforded the backs of children while seated, they ale 
most necessarily assume a bent and crooked positions such a position often 
aseumed, or long continued, tends to that deformity, which has beome extremely 
cormon with children in modern timese and leads to disease of the epine in _ 
innumerable instances, especially with delicate female childrens 
The scate in school-rooms should be so constructed that the whole thigh 
oan rest upon then, and at the seme time the foot stand firm’y upon the floor. 
All seats should have beoks high enough to reach the shoulder blades; low 
backs, although better than none, are far less easy and useful than high ones: 
and will not prevent pain and uneasiness after sitting a considerable time, — 
Young children should be permitted to change their position often, to stand 
on their feet, to march and to visit the play ground. One hous is as long 
as any child, under ten years of age, should be confined at once; and four 
hours as long as he should be confined to his seat in one daye
-P-A-G-E-58
Second Querys "What general effects will be produced upon t he health 
of children by stinting their supply of fresh air, through defeots in 
ventilatione® 
An ansver to this query, will invoke some chemical principles, in connexion 
with the animal economy, not extensively and fully wmderstoode : 
The blood As it circvlates through the vessels in our bodies, gecumlated 
a deleteriova principle onlled carbon, which is a poison itself, and must be 
discharged frequently, or 1t becomes dangerous to lifes In the process of 
respiration or breathing, this poigonove principle unites in the lungs with a 
proportion of the oxyren in the air, anf roms carbonic acid, which is expelled 
from tie lugs at each oxpiratione The proportion of oxyren in the air received 
’ 4nto the lings, is nbout trenty-one in the hundreds in the alr expelled, about 
eighteen in the hundred;- the properition of carbonio acid in the inhaled air 
4s one part in the hundred, in the exhaled air about four parts in the hundreds 
By respiration, an adult persons spoils, or renders unfit for this process, 
about one gallon of air in a minutes By this great consumption of pure air in 
a school-room, made tight and filled with scholars, it will be easily seen 
., thet the whole air will soon te rendored impure, and nfit for the purpose 
for which it is designed. If we sontime to inhale this contaiminated air 
rendered constantly worse the longer wo are confined in it, this process 
inthe lungs will not be performed in a perfect manner, the carbon will not 
all escape from the blood, but will be ciroulate to the brain, and produce its 
deleterious effects upon the organ, to which it 18 a poisons If no opportunity 
be afforded for its regular onoape, death will take place in a few mimtes, 
as in strengulation by @ cord, drowning, and ineersion in irrespirable aire 
The cause of deabh, in the retention and ofroulation of this poisionovs 
principle, in all these sasese 
If a smaller portion is allowed to ciroulate, through the vessels than 
will preve fatal, it produces stupor, syncope, and other dangerous effects 
vpon the brain end nerves. In still lese quantity, 1t produces duliness, 
sleepiness, anc incapecitates us for all mcntal efforts and physical activity» 
The dullness of @ school, after having been in long session in a close room, 
and of a conpregations, curing a protracted religious service, are often 
attributable to this canse, mainly, if not solely. Both teacher and scholar, 
preacher and hearer, are often preatly affeated in this way, without being at 
all sensible of the oavsese Fifty scholars will very soon contéminate the air 
of a school room at the rate of a gallon a mimitoe ~ 
Suppose a schooleroom to be thirty feet square, and nine feot high, it 
will contain 15,996,000 cubic inches of atmospheric eir. According to Daby 
end Thompaon, to accurate ani selentific chemists, one individual respires 
and contaminates 6500 cubie inches of air in a mimuites. Fifty scholars will 
respire 325,000 cublo inohes in tho same timee Iy about forty minutes, all 
the air of such @ room will have become contaminated, 4f fresh supplies are 
not provided. The quantity of carbonia acid, produced by the respiration of 
fifty scholars, will be about 650 eubie inches in an houre
-P-A-G-E-59
From these calculations, we must see how soon the air of a schooleroom becomes 
unfit to suatain the animal powers, and how unfavorable to vigorous wental effort 
such a contarinated atmosphere must prove to bee To avoid this most serious evil, 
is a desideratum, which has not yet beon reached in the construction of aschool-housese 
In my opinion, every house and room which 1 closed for any considerable time upon 
a concourse of people, should be warmed by pure air from out-of-doors, heated by furnaces 
‘placed in a cellar, (and every scho-l-house should have # cellar,) or in some con- 
tiguous apartment, so that the supply of air for the fire should not be from the 
schooleroome Furnaces for warming external air may bo constructed cheaply, so as 
effectually to answor the purposes of warmth and ventilations 
| When a quantity of warm fresh air is forced into a school-room by means of a furnace, 
the foul air is forced out at every crevice, and at the ventilating passages-~---the 
currents are all warm quite to these passagese 
’ But if the room is warmed by a stove or fireplace, tie cold air fron without rushes 
in at every passare and every crevice, and while the partes of the body nearest the 
fire are too varm, the current of cold air rushing to the fire to sustain the com~ 
bustion, keep all the other parts cold and unoomfortables This is @ most direct way 
to vroduce disenses rothing can affect tie s:stem more unfavorably than currenta of 
cold air eoming upon va when quite rarme 
I have said that school-hovses should have cellare under thems The fhor of a 
building without a cellor is always cold, and often damos this tends to keep the fect 
of scholars cold, while the head, in a region of air mich warmer, will bekept hote 
This 4s both umaturél and unhealthfuls The feet should alwaya he kept warm and the 
head ¢oole Wo verson oan enjoy good health whose fest are habitually colds In school- 
rooms heated by stoves, the feet are very liable to be cold, while the upper stratum 
of air kept hot and dry by a long reach of pipe, produces a very unpleasant and un- 
favorable state of the head----hoadach, vertigo and syncope often take place in svoh 
@ rooms 
fhe human body is so constituted, that it onn bear almost any degree of heat or 
cold, if the change be not too sudden, and all parts of it be subjected to it alikes 
We find no partiouler inconvenience from respiring air at the temperature of 90 degrees 
on the one hand, or at sero on the others but inequalities of temperature, at the 
game time, affect us very differently, and can never be suffered for a long tine 
without dangers 
There is one consideration in the preparation of furnaces for warming rooms, that 
should not be overlooked. ‘The object should be to force into the room a large quantity 
of air heated a few degrees above the temperatures The air chamber should be capacious, 
and the passazes frece The air should always be taken from out of doors, and never 
from a cellars The air of a cellar is often impure inself, and, if pure, a cellar 
that is at all tight car-ot furnish an adequate supply. The whole air of a school+ 
room should -e changed at least every hour; if oftener, it would be betters Ife 
cellar is not muoh lerger than the room ebove it, this supply will soon be exhausted 
nlene The air of the cellar may te sufficient to supply the combustion of the fuel; 
thie ig all it should doe--and for this pvrpose it 1s better than air from out of 
doors, as the esldness checks the teat, and diminishes the temperature of tho fire, 
and its power of beating the furnaces 
In giving my views on-this subject, I have been so desultory as to emtrace nearly 
all that I onn say on the other queries proposed to me. At any rate, my letter is 
already of an unreasonatle lenrth, and I must oome to a Close. Wishing you every 
success in the arduous duties of vour present station, 
I remain truly and affectionately yours,

Extraot of a Letter from Benjamin Silliman, Professor of Chemistry in Yale College, 
in reply to an inguiry similer to the second proposod to Drs Woodwards 
“of our atmosphere, only one fifth part, by volume, ie fitted to sustain lifes 
That vortion is oxygen pass the remaining four fifthe being azote or nitrogen gas, 
whioh, when breathed alono, kills by suffocatione The withdrawing of the oxygen gas, 
by reapiration or otherwise, de troye the povar of the atmosphere to sustain life, and 
thie alone furnishes a decisive reason, why frosh air must be constantly supplied, in 
order to support animal lifes Fut this is not alle Every eontact of the air with the 
lungs, generates in the human subject from 6 to 8 per conte of carbonic acid gas~---the 
same gas thot often destroys the lives of people who descend, incautiously, into wells 
or who remain in close rooms, with a charcoal fire not under a flue. Thie gas----the 
carbonic acid---kills, it 48 true, by suffocation, as azote does, and as water acts in 
drawninge Put this is not all. It acte positively, with a peculiar and malignant energy, 
upon the vital powers, which, even when life is not inatantly destroyed, it prostrates 
or paralyzes, probably through the nervous evateme 
I find by mumerous trials, made with my own lungs, that a confined portion of air, 
* suffioient, however, to f111 the lungs perfectly with a full inspiration,---is 80 cn- 
taminated by a single contact, that a candle will scarcely burn in it atvalls and, after 
three oontacta, the candle will then go out, and an aniral would die in it as quickly 
as if irmnersed in azote, or even in waters . 
It is evicent, therefore, that a constant renewal of the air ia indispensable t 
safety as rerards life, and no porson can be compelled to breathe, again and again, 
the sane portions of air, without -anifest injury to health, and, it maybe, danger to 
litee 
It follows, then, thet the sir of avartnents, and especially of those occupied 
by many nersons at once, onght to te throrn off by a froo ventilation, and, when blown 
from the lunre, the enme air ought not to be arain inhaled, until it leas been purified 
from the carbonic acid pes, and its due proportion of oxygen gas restored, This is of= 
fected bv the vwover surface of the creen leaves of treos and plants, when acted upon 
by the direct soler rays. The carbonic acid fas is then decomposed, the carbon ia ab- 
sorbed to sustain, in part, the life of the vlant, by affording it one element of its 
food, while the oxygen gas is liberated and restored t> the atmospheree” '

Extract of a Letter from Dr. Samuel G. Nowe, Director of the Institution for the Education 
of tho Blind, in Pearl Street, Bostone : : 
"y take it for granted, that the existence of blindness, in the human rece, like 
every other ph sical infirmity, is the consequence of departure from the lews of Gods 
that the proportion of blind persons in every cormunity is dependent upon the domparative 
depree of violation of the natural laws; and that soientifio observation can in almost 
evory case point to the kind and degree of violations 
Imporfect vision, partial and total blindness, are more common among men and 
nivals, in eiriliged than in savaye or .arLarous nationse It seems to be well ascertained 
hat blindness igs more common as ye approach tie equator; and that on the same parallel 
t is more frequent. in dry sandy soils, than in humid ones.

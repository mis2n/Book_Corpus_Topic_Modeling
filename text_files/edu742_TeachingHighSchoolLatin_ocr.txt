  PREFACE 
This little book represents a revision and enlargment 
of the Handbook for High-School Teachers of Latin which 
was published as a bulletin of the Missouri State Normal 
School, Cape Girardeau, in 1907, while the writer was 
connected with that institution as professor of Latin and 
Greek. That bulletin had a suprising popularity. An 
edition of five thousand was distributed within a short 
time, mainly in response to requests from all parts of the 
country. Even after a lapse of more than eight years, calls 
for copies are frequently received. 
An earnest effort has been made to prepare a practical 
manual that will meet some of the immediate needs of the 
young teacher of Latin. The plans proposed represent 
actual experience in the high school, the normal school, 
and the college. They have been tested thoroughly and 
found effective. They do not represent a final solution of 
all the problems of the young teacher, but they do represent 
the best contribution the writer can now make to the cause 
of better teaching in our schools. 
Some of the suggestions here given were made originally 
by Professor C. U. Clark, director of the American School of 
Classical Studies, Rome, Italy. My obligation to him is very 
great. Professors G. J. Laing and F. J. Miller, of the Uni- 
versity of Chicago, did me the kindness to read the manu- 
script and make suggestions which have added very much 
to the value of the book. Their help is fully appreciated. 
Professor Francis W. Kelsey, of the University of Michi- 
gan, gave me permission to use quotations from his excellent

volume, Latin and Greek in American Education. Those 
who read this book will understand my high appreciation 
of this favor. 
Young Latin teachers are doing a large part in educating 
the rising generation and in upholding scholarly ideals 
among the people. May this little book serve to strengthen 
their hands and hearts in their good work.

  CHAPTER I 
LATIN’S IMMEDIATE SERVICE IN EDUCATION 
Latin one of several subjects.—For many centuries 
Latin has held an honored place in the schools of Europe 
and America, and during much of that time it has been one 
of three or four subjects whose material has been so 
organized that they could be used as effective educational 
instruments. Within the last half-century a number of 
other subjects have been developed, that is, have been 
found to possess a valuable content, and about that content 
has been grouped a literature sufficient for successful use 
in the schools. Of late there has been a rather unfortunate 
tendency to force into this company of tested subjects an 
almost indefinite number which have no certain content, no 
organized literature, and no record of achievement. Some 
of these proposed subjects may some day prove worthy of 
acceptance, but they should not be urged unduly. If they 
are to have a place, it should be a place of their own. 
They should not crowd out other subjects which have 
rendered effective service. 
In the work of educating the people, every subject which 
can do a definite work and secure definite results should 
have its place. Where more than one are known to reach 
the same result, that one should have the preference which 
secures the immediate result sought and which has the 
largest margin in other related results. 
Why do we teach Latin in the schools?—Latin and 
mathematics have had more than a fair share of the criti- 
cism of those who would find something wrong with our 
I 
 
-P-A-G-E-12
  2 TEACHING HIGH-SCHOOL LATIN 
educational system. This is especially true of Latin 
because there seems to be a mistaken idea of what can 
fairly be expected of Latin in the schools. Now and then 
an extremist seems to tlame Latin for not doing all those 
things which are expected of all the high-school subjects 
combined. In rare instances a warm defender of Latin 
takes about the same point of view and claims credit for 
all that is accomplished. Neither position is correct or 
reasonable. 
Many of those who from experience know the possi- 
bilities of Latin are persuaded that a well-trained teacher 
can reach more phases of a young man’s education by using 
Latin than by using any other single subject. This may 
well be the attitude of every teacher toward his subject, 
but he must be careful not to undervalue the work of other 
teachers, or to claim as his own results which he is only a 
sharer in securing. Latin -has a certain rather definite 
part in our educational scheme, and it behooves the faithful 
teacher to know what he is expected to accomplish and to 
see, first of all, that his alee are exerted in that direction. 
In indicating the ends which we may reasonably expect 
to attain in teaching Latin, it seems a satisfactory plan 
to give the statements prepared by men who have all the 
facts well in hand. 
a) Professor Foster, New York City—The more imme- 
diate purpose of the Latin teacher is well set out in this 
quotation from Professor W. E. Foster, of the Stuyvesant 
High School, New York City, in “Reorganization of Sec- 
ondary Education,” a bulletin of the United States Bureau 
of Education: 3   
The following are some of the aims which seem worth while: to_ 
enrich_the-English vocabulary, bot both in the addition of new words ;
-P-A-G-E-13
  LATIN’S SERVICE IN EDUCATION 3 
and particularly by a more ch and clear understanding 
word, phrase, and clause relations; to to teach clesrmais and Scearacy 
of expression, both oral and written; to develop habits of industry 
and application; to make the pupil an intelligent-critic-of-his-own 
oral and written speech and that of others; to lay a good foundation 
for the study of English and other modern languages; to read some 
of the great Latin masterpieces; “to give a wider view of life through 
familiarity with a great civilization rémote from the present, both in 
time and place, ‘in the cool, calm air of noncontemporaneous events.’”” 
Many of the results of the successful teaching of Latin just men- 
tioned are, so to speak, by-products. It is worthy of remark that 
these so-called by-products of the study of Latin—the illumination 
of an English word, of a grammatical principle, or of a fundamental 
law of language, the. casual remark that throws a suggestive side- 
light upon some vital fact of history, of law, of religious and social 
custom, and upon civilization in general—are the things which cling 
in the memory long after one has lost the ability to translate a passage 
from Cicero or to classify a subjunctive or an ablative. 
b) Professor Kelsey, University of Michigan—The 
following quotation from Latin and Greek in American 
Education, p. 21, gives a very complete and comprehensive 
summary of the purposes back of Latin teaching:   
  
Specifically, Latin and Greek become effective as educational 
instruments in at least seven different ways: 
By training in the essentials of scientific method: observation, com- 
parison, generalization; 
By making our own language intelligible and developing the power of 
expression; 
By bringing the mind into contact with literature in elemental forms; 
_ By giving insight into a basic civilization; 
By cultivating the constructive imagination; 
/ By clarifying moral ideals, and stimulating to right conduct; 
By furnishing means of recreation. 
Of these, the sixth and seventh belong more particularly 
to the discussion of the chapter which follows.
-P-A-G-E-14
  4 TEACHING HIGH-SCHOOL LATIN 
c) Professor Laurie, University of Edinburgh.—In his 
volume, Lectures on Language and Linguistic Method, 
chap. ix, Professor Laurie gives the following ‘reasons 
for teaching Latin”: 
We teach Latin— 
1. Because as a formal and grammatical study it has peculiar 
advantages, and more than any other language (except Greek) gives 
discipline to the intelligence, and the result of discipline, viz., intel- 
lectual power. 
2. The study of Latin gives (to an Englishman at least), more 
than any other language can do, a training in words—the relative 
values and the functions of words—and, consequently, training in the 
thought-things which words denote. The shades of meaning in 
vocables are brought into high relief. 
3. The analysis and subsequent synthesis whereby we | truly 
comprehend an English sentence, and which is a direct training of 
the processes of mind in knowing (in the scientific or any other field), 
are most effective as training when it is a foreign tongue that we are 
teaching; and, above all, when that tongue is Latin. This is because, 
in order to produce an English translation, a pupil is forced, whether 
he will or not, delikerateiy and of set purpose to consider the mutual 
relations of the parts of a complex sentence; and, secondly, because 
of the exactness and precision with which these logical relations are 
brought into prominence in a highly synthetic language. In this 
relation, Latin is better than Greek, because there is less deviation 
in it from a normal type. There is breadth, strength, and simplicity 
about its grammar. .... 
‘\\4. The working out of a translation from a foreign tongue is 
further a training of the imagination, which has to bring itself into 
play in order to unite into a whole, in their true signification, the parts 
of a sentence. Latin in a special sense gives this training because 
of its remoteness. The imagination, moreover, is checked and kept 
within the wholesome bounds of truthfulness by comparing the 
results achieved with the original. 
5. Latin is to a very large extent (to the extent of two-thirds 
at least) our own tongue. In studying Latin, therefore, we are 
studying our own tongue in its sources, and getting all the discipline
-P-A-G-E-15
  
LATIN’S SERVICE IN EDUCATION 5 
and nutrition of mind which flows from the study of the origin and 
history of words. Latin enables us to revivify our own tongue for 
ourselves. Nay, we are studying our own language in much of its 
syntactical mould also, as may be seen by reading our early prose 
writers, and even those of the eighteenth century. 
6. It follows from the preceding reason that in studying Latin 
we are brought face to face with modern conceptions as to moral 
duties, social relations, and legal obligations in their origins, and that 
we thus undergo a kind of unconscious philosophical training suited 
to the as yet immature mind, and moulding its conceptions from the 
foundation. Dr. W. T. Harris, Education Commissioner for the 
United States, says: ‘One may say that of a hundred boys, fifty 
of whom had studied Latin for a period of six months, while the other 
fifty had not studied Latin at all, the fifty with the smattering of 
Latin would possess some slight impulse towards analyzing the legal 
and political view of human life, and surpass the other fifty in that 
direction. Placed on a distant frontier with a task of building a 
new civilization, the fifty with a smattering of Latin would furnish 
the law-makers and political rulers, legislators, and builders of state.””. 
This may be an exaggeration, but there is an element of truth in 
it. In any case, Latin is not a dead language. Its influence is still 
living in our own tongue, our thought, our feeling, our institutions, 
our law, our religion, our polity. A language does not cease to live 
because it ceases to be spoken. 
7. In studying Latin we are taking possession of the key of the ae 
Romance languages, shortening the time needed for acquiring these 
by at least one-half. 
8. The study of Latin introduces the pupil in its later stages to a 
conscious discernment of art in language—the artistic and beautiful 
in expression—and this to a degree which no modern tongue can do, 
because, first, of its chaste severity of form, and, secondly, because 
being so far removed from our own time, we can look at it as a fresh 
and alien object. Thus by contrast our implicit feelings regarding 
literary form in our own tongue are brought into explicit conscious- 
ness—raised, in short, from vague feeling into knowledge. 
9. The study of Latin, especially in its later stages, when it is 
accompanied by the study of the life, art, and literature of Rome, has. 
a remarkable influence on the tone of thought and character. It has. 
 
-P-A-G-E-16
    
6 TEACHING HIGH-SCHOOL LATIN 
influence by connecting us in a living way with what seems, but truly 
is not, a dead past, and thereby expanding our intellectual and moral 
sympathies so as to embrace that past as part of our own life. It 
makes us members of a larger human society. Modern contemporary 
language and life are too near to our own to have this cultivating 
influence to the same extent, and do not teach us to see things in a 
true perspective; they may be said to broaden our lives, but they 
do not lengthen them. Neither the Hindu nor the Chinese language 
and life would serve, because they are not our past. The ancient 
life, by thus stimulating the historical imagination and carrying it 
out of the present, tends to give balance of mind, checks sciolism of 
opinion and crudeness of judgment based on a narrow induction of 
things which, as being close at hand, are apt to assume undue im- 
portance. The true humanity of the growing boy is thus deepened 
and strengthened. 
Of these, the sixth and ninth belong more particularly 
to the discussion of the following chapter. 
d) Mr. Charles R. Williams, editor of the “ Indianapolis 
News.”—In an address before the Michigan Schoolmasters’ 
Club, Editor Charles R. Williams, speaking on ‘‘ The Study 
of Latin and Greek as a Training for Practical Affairs,” 
gave the following summary of the results which follow 
classical study: 
For a man that seeks to be a leader in the practical life of the 
world the study of the humanities, of Greek and Latin, is to be recom- 
mended and urged, therefore, because of the thorough understanding 
and mastery of English that it gives; because of the discipline of the 
intellectual powers it affords, in determining the precise meaning of 
an author’s discourse; because of the knowledge gained of the sources 
of our own language, our institutions, and our culture; because of the 
cultivation of taste that comes thereby for all that is high and fine 
in literature and art; because of the wider vision it gives to the 
spirit of men, and because it deepens one’s sense of the continuity 
of culture, of the solidarity of the race, of our debt to the past, and 
so of our obligation to the future.   
-P-A-G-E-17
    LATIN’S SERVICE IN EDUCATION 7 
Summary of results.—These statements of the results 
which should follow Latin study are about as complete as 
any that can be found. A close examination of them seems 
to lead up to the following groups: 
GROUP I 
1. Enrichment of the English vocabulary. New words are 
added, and their exact values and meanings, together with those of 
familiar words, are understood. 
2. Accurate knowledge of the English sentence. Its analysis 
and synthesis, with appreciation of word, phrase, and clause relations, 
become fixed in mind. 
3. The foundation is laid for modern-language study, in particular 
the Romance languages. The Teutonic languages are made easier 
by reason of training in foreign language. 
GROUP II 
1. An insight into the Roman civilization, its laws, customs, 
religion, and ordinary life, with a consequent appreciation of our 
indebtedness to the past. 
2. Contact with the world’s great past and with one of the world’s 
great literatures. 
GROUP III 
1. Habits of industry and intense application. 
2. Clearness and accuracy of thought and expression and intel- 
ligent criticism of oral and written speech. 
3. Development of literary taste and of interest in art and litera- 
ture. 
4. Mental discipline and the consequent development of intellec- 
tual power. 
GROUP IV 
Under this heading may be included that larger service rendered 
by Latin in education and in life which is touched upon in these 
statements but discussed more at length in the succeeding chapter. 
|? “Who is equal to these things ?”?—One who examines 
this list wonders whether all of these things can be
-P-A-G-E-18
8 TEACHING HIGH-SCHOOL LATIN 
accomplished by Latin, and, if so, whether anything 
is left for the other subjects taught in the high schools. 
Not all these results can be hoped for from the high- 
school courses in Latin, as will be seen later on. Evidence 
in unmeasured quantity is available to prove that Latin in 
the hands of a well-educated man can do large things in 
securing these results. There may be other means avail- 
able, but the evidence is not so complete or irresistible. 
One difference between the Latin teacher and his fellow- 
teacher is that he is able to work with chart and compass 
in hand, if he will, and may know what port he is making 
for and what he is expected to declare when he enters the 
harbor. 
The Latin teacher may not succeed in doing all the 
things enumerated; most probably he will not; but he is 
limited only by the capacity of the class, measured by its 
preparation and native strength, and by a just regard for 
the other departments that have claim on the pupil’s time. 
Therefore to his great relief, he may have before him a 
fairly dependable statement of his duties. 
The teacher’s task.—1. Teach Latin, and teach Latin 
for its own sake.—By this is meant that you are to see to it 
that the amount of work in Latin apportioned to each year 
is taught as thoroughly and perfectly as your ability and 
that of the class will permit. The exact work required in 
each year is indicated in the discussions which are given 
on another page. Your prime task is to see, to the best 
of your ability, that the Latin assigned is learned—as to 
forms, constructions, vocabularies, reading, writing. 
This task, if well done, will secure in a fair measure the 
results shown in group I. These results will appear more 
abundantly after further study in college Latin, but you  
-P-A-G-E-19
LATIN’S SERVICE IN EDUCATION 9 
may have group I to your credit, anyway. The other’ 
groups, especially II and III, will be slightly affected also 
by this first task. It may be that this is all that your class 
can be held to. If so, your part is done. 
2. Teach Latin for the pupil’s sake.—This is in fact our 
only reason for teaching anything. By laying aside this 
consideration for the moment, as is suggested above, 
certain results can be obtained which are in themselves 
desirable. When those smaller results have been obtained, 
this larger task confronts you—the task of so teaching 
Latin: that the pupil’s mental horizon continually enlarges 
and that he becomes more fully possessed of his own natural 
resources. 
Rules cannot be laid down for this part of the task as 
they can for the teaching of syntax, and yet the real teacher 
sees his opportunity and uses it in making the way for a 
good habit or a noble resolution. 
This second task, if well done, will secure the results 
enumerated in groups II and III, and affect strongly those 
referred to in group IV. The teacher may make more 
sure of group II than of group III or IV, in the very nature 
of the case, but all these results will be larger and more 
pronounced if the pupil’s study is continued in college. 
The high school can only make a reasonable beginning in 
the way of securing the larger results on which life and 
destiny depend.
-P-A-G-E-20
CHAPTER II 
LATIN’S LARGER SERVICE IN EDUCATION AND IN LIFE 
Latin’s hold upon public confidence.—Latin has had a 
place in the schools of Europe and America for many cen- 
turies and is now being studied by more young men and 
young women than at any other time in the world’s his- 
tory. Men like Herbert Spencer have tried to break this 
hold that Latin has had upon the confidence of the public, 
but they have not been wholly successful. Young people 
continue to elect Latin, even against the opposition of 
administrative officers, and their parents approve the 
choice. The people of our country are so firmly con- 
vinced of the effectiveness of Latin that we have very 
few high schools which do not offer that subject. Those 
which do not offer Latin are generally discredited, and 
it is rather seldom that a young man who has aspira- 
tions of real scholarship will voluntarily attend such a 
school. 
Why this clinging to Latin?—There is a reason for this 
persistent holding to Latin. Other subjects are widely 
heralded as substitutes, and Latin is decried by various 
agencies, but all to little avail. Why do parents encourage 
their sons and daughters to study Latin rather than one 
of the proffered substitutes ? 
There are several reasons for this, but probably the one 
which more than all others grips people and gains friends 
for the study of Latin is the(emphatic indorsement given 
it by many of our country’s noblest and best men, who 
have not hesitated to express their indebtedness to classical 
10 
 
-P-A-G-E-21
LATIN’S SERVICE IN EDUCATION AND IN LIFE 11 
study and to attribute to it much of their own success in 
life. ) This is and has been a stone wall against which the 
charges of anti-Latinists have fallen flat. Hundreds who 
are recognized as the strong men of the nation have given 
evidence as to the value derived in their own lives from the 
study of Greek and Latin, but have said very little of other 
subjects. ee 
The evidence of great men is conclusive.—It is the 
merest folly to undertake to set aside the emphatic evidence 
of statesmen, business men, bankers, lawyers, physicians, 
ministers, engineers, scientists, and others in large numbers, 
such as was given at the classical conferences held at the 
University of Michigan. Among these witnesses were such 
men as Drs. Vaughan, De Nancrede, and Hinsdale of the 
university medical faculty;. Professors Saddler, Patterson, 
Williams, and Davis of the engineering faculty; Mr. 
Merritt Starr and Mr. Lyndon Evans of the Chicago bar; 
Dean Hutchens of, the university law faculty; Hon. 
Harlow P. Davock, Hon. Levi I. Barbour, and Hon. 
Hinton E. Spalding of the Detroit bar; Hon. James Bryce, 
then ambassador from Great Britain; Hon. John W. Foster, 
Hon. James Brown Scott, and Dr. Harvey W. Wiley of 
Washington; and Mr. Charles Williams of Indianapolis. 
All these, and others in goodly numbers, were outspoken 
in their support of the classics, and nearly every one of the 
speakers recognized the service which had been rendered 
to himself. 
Recent testimony from President Wilson, Ex-President 
Taft, Hon. John D. Long, Dr. Lyman Abbott, Mr. S. S. 
McClure, Mr. C. P. Steinmetz, and others, is familiar to 
those who regularly read the Classical Weekly and the 
Classical Journal.
-P-A-G-E-22
  12 -TEACHING HIGH-SCHOOL LATIN 
These men are as capable of giving competent evidence 
as are any men who ever lived. If they recognize the 
worth of classical study and favor its continuance as an 
educational instrument, the mere faddist or the educa- 
tional revolutionist may shout himself hoarse. Sensible 
men who want to make the best possible citizens out of 
their children will persist in holding to the studies which 
have a record writ large in the lives of our best men and 
women. 
The classics in character-building—Most fathers 
recognize the fact that their sons and daughters have a 
limited period of time available for their education. They 
are anxious that during this time the foundation be laid 
on which strong character may be builded. Many of them 
know from their own experience, others from evidence such 
as has been referred to, that Latin has been credited with 
doing large things in the way of character-building. They 
do not wish to experiment with the destiny of their own 
children, and in consequence they hold fast to “the old 
ways.” Very few men want their sons to grow up into the 
type of citizen that is represented by the educational 
agitator, but all would gladly have their sons follow in the 
footsteps of such men as those who have been mentioned as 
friendly to the classics. 
Generally, and in the colleges in particular, Latin has 
been taught by strong men of unquestioned integrity, and 
their strength has been potent in doubling the value of the 
subject which they have taught. Latin furnished them an 
effective means of directing the development of the young 
men who studied in their classes. Perhaps they could 
have done good work in character-building with some other 
subject, but the point is that they did accomplish what 
 
-P-A-G-E-23
LATIN’S SERVICE IN EDUCATION AND IN LIFE 13 
they did with Latin as their instrument. And Latin is 
just as readily available today as it ever was. 
It is submitted then that much of the firmness of the 
public’s hold upon the classics is due to a fixed belief that 
in some way these subjects have a decided bearing upon 
the developing of character in the young. The charge that 
Latin is not a practical subject has been waived in favor of 
the consideration that it does a larger service in enabling 
the student to store up in mind and heart those permanent 
resources which come forth as from a never-failing store- 
house when their master has need. So long as Latin 
study continues to contribute so largely to human society, 
men and women will call for its help in making citizens and 
noble characters. 
The immediate and the larger service.—In the state- 
ments given in the previous chapter, which bore more 
directly upon the immediate work of the Latin teacher, 
it was noticed that the larger service loomed up high even © 
by the very side of the more immediate; that those whose 
statements were quoted invariably led up to or pointed to 
the larger service of Latin study as, after all, quite as 
important as the smaller and more immediate. In other 
words, the immediate was apparently regarded as a door- 
way to the larger and more vital. The educator who recog- 
nizes the fact that education amounts to nothing except 
as it develops the larger phases of human character and 
makes for the sum of human betterment has indeed found 
the secret of real service. Very generally Latin is credited 
with effectiveness in the hands of such educators. Perhaps 
the best way to bring out this larger service, as coupled with 
and following the more immediate, is to present the evidence 
of men who are recognized as competent witnesses.
-P-A-G-E-24
  14 TEACHING HIGH-SCHOOL LATIN : 
The evidence of Mr. James Loeb.—The following state- 
ment concludes an address made by Mr. James Loeb, of 
Kuhn, Loeb & Co., bankers: 
The great and legitimate aim of a business man is to make money, 
to provide for himself and his family such luxuries and comforts as 
his tastes and social standing demand. But when a man has reached 
the goal of his desires, when he has made his pile and wants to enjoy 
it, then comes the time for the making of the real and only balance 
sheet. Then he must ask himself, “What are my resources, now that 
I have everything that money can buy? What are my spiritual and 
intellectual assets? How can I best spend what is left to me of life ?”” 
Lucky is the man whose early training fits him for something more 
than the golf field, or the tennis court, and for something better than 
the gaming-table when his days of business activity are over. He can 
taste the gentler pleasures that await him in his study and by the 
blazing hearth-fire. His Sophocles or his Homer or his Catullus will 
make the winter of life seem like its early spring, when the greatest 
struggle he knew was with the elusive rules of grammar and syntax. 
As seen by Mr. William Sloane.—The following state- 
ment is taken from an address by Mr. William Sloane, 
president of W. and J. Sloane, bankers: 
A business man who has had a classical education cannot fail 
to remember with reverence and affection those patient, consecrated 
men who taught him Latin and Greek, and awoke in him a love: for 
the beautiful. Such men as these, with ideals, he perhaps no longer 
meets in his daily vocation. With the passing years he may have 
forgotten the very names of the classics he read at college; but the 
memory of those days, of those men, of their enthusiasm in their 
work, has had its effect on the man himself and he is better for it, and 
I believe a better business man, too; for unconsciously he has acquired 
something which he values as a precious possession, a something which 
distinguishes him from his fellows and makes him singularly happy 
in his work. 
We must look after the man himself.—In this connec- 
tion it is proper to call attention to the necessity of making
-P-A-G-E-25
LATIN’S SERVICE IN EDUCATION AND IN LIFE 15 
the man himself the center of educational interest. We 
have had a somewhat strenuous campaign in the interest 
of highly specialized scientists, engineers, mechanics, and 
operatives, and the end has been fairly well attained, but 
there is ground for complaint in the type of men thus 
obtained. It is being felt more and more that ‘a sane 
education must include primarily such development and 
training as will render the man’s nature refined and en- 
nobled, will awake him to lofty endeavor, and will bring 
him into sympathy with what is noblest and best in life— 
in his own life and in the world in which he moves. This * 
fuller training for a place in the world as a complete man 
is wholly independent of the question of a training for any 
trade or profession—which it does not exclude, of course; 
but the emphasis is changed from an apparently essential 
one to one which the whole world will recognize as abso- 
lutely real and fundamental. 
Aman may bea splendidly trained farmer, or mechanic, 
or even professional man, and may beable to make money 
in abundance; but if he is not more than these things, does 
life really mean much to him? Is he broadly sympathetic 
toward what is best in the world of art and letters? Does 
he see anything in painting, or sculpture, or in music ? 
Do these have any message for him? Does he find a 
friend in great books? Do the spirits of great and good 
men commune with his spirit as he go2s about his daily 
toil ? 
Rather, is there not a danger that his life will be hollow; 
that he will be lacking in a spirit of true humility and of 
appreciation of the rights of others; that he will become 
hard, unfeeling, ungenerous, and self-centered; that he - 
will be dependent upon public amusements for his highest  
-P-A-G-E-26
  
16 TEACHING HIGH-SCHOOL LATIN 
pleasures? Will not those finer qualities of nature forsake 
the man who does not cultivate them, in whose mind a 
permanent place has not been prepared for their in- 
dwelling ? 
After the living is made, then what ?—We all recognize 
the importance of professional and vocational training, 
and Latinists have done their part in promoting the interests 
of the subjects which bear upon the problem of making a 
living. After the living is made, then what ? 
It is not enough that a man be a good mechanic, or 
farmer, or even physician, lawyer, or teacher—his educa- 
tion must stand or fall by whether he is, in addition, a 
man of catholic spirit, with an appreciation of the higher 
and better things of life, or merely first, last, and all the 
time, a servant of his trade or profession. Nature has 
much to do with these qualities; but it is submitted that 
an education which neglects the culture element, which 
fails to take these native forces and to polish and refine 
them for the happiness of the possessor, and for the service 
of the common good, by reason of this neglect is a destroyer 
of what heaven meant for a blessing to society. 
Professional training is a necessity, but it should not 
be so coldly professional, should not so severely stress the 
making of a professional out of the man, that he will become 
not more than a mechanical device, that he will fail to 
become a full, open-minded, generous-hearted man. The 
training of the man should have the first place, and the 
training for a livelihood should be secondary. 
‘ The case of Darwin.—This severe application to the 
material, to the exclusion of higher things, is well repre- 
sented in a statement of Charles Darwin, as found in his 
autobiography: 
   
-P-A-G-E-27
  
LATIN’S SERVICE IN EDUCATION AND IN LIFE 17 
Up to the age of thirty and beyond it, poetry of many kinds, 
such as the works of Milton, Gray, Byron, Wordsworth, Coleridge, 
Shelley, gave me great delight, and even as a schoolboy I took intense 
delight in Shakespeare. But now for many years I cannot read a 
line of poetry; I have tried to read Shakespeare, and found it so 
intolerably dull that it nauseated me. I have lost my taste for pic- 
tures, and for music. My mind seems to have become a kind of 
machine for grinding general laws out of a large collection of facts, 
but why this should have caused the atrophy of that part of the brain 
on which the higher tastes depend, I cannot conceive... . . The 
loss of these tastes is a loss of happiness, and may possibly be injurious 
to the intellect, and more probably to the moral character, by enfeeb- 
ling the emotional part of our nature. 
On this Professor Walter Miller says: 
If Charles Darwin found the loss of his higher aesthetic tastes 
so lamentable, how much more lamentable must be the paralysis 
of the intellectual power when this exclusive devotion to the culti- 
vation of one side of the intellectual nature begins before the mind 
has fairly developed. But utilitarianism, with promises of material 
wealth, is ready with her reply: ‘Seek ye first money; culture after 
wealth,” and technical education without the basis of broad culture 
has grown and spread to an incredible extent. Said President 
Butler: “Its essential narrowness and philistinism increase with its 
success in establishing itself, and it promises for a long time to come 
to assert its overwhelming ascendancy, until a race of men shall come 
upon the stage with about as much religion as a threshing-machine, 
and hardly more social charm than a storage battery.””* 
Mr. Williams, in conclusion.—-This. bearing of the 
‘classics upon the larger and more vital phases of human 
life can hardly be presented more convincingly than in 
these words, taken from the address already referred to, 
of Mr. Williams of the Indianapolis News: 
It does make a difference, a very great and momentous difference, 
to my notion, what a youth studies in his formative and impression-

18 TEACHING HIGH-SCHOOL LATIN 
able years. He is to gain discipline, he is to win mastery over him- 
self, to learn to use his intellectual powers; but if he can attain these 
necessary ends and at the same time be adding vastly to his spiritual 
resources, to the comfort of his soul, to the joy of his true life in the 
years to come, when the cares and responsibilities and distractions 
of professional and business activity shall absorb his time and energy, 
should not those subjects for study be preferred which shall enable 
him most easily to bring about these most desirable results? Let 
us never long leave out of our thought that life is not mere getting 
and spending, mere sowing and reaping, mere material success, of 
whatever form. That is only the basis for something better and 
higher and more enduring. 
And so, especially for the young man that hopes to be a leader 
in the professional and business life of the time, in finance and affairs 
of state—in practical life, in a word—those studies are to be preferred 
which shal! make him more a man, give him a wider outlook, a larger 
prospect of life, quicken his power of vision, enlarge his range of 
sympathy and appreciation, and bring him into the fullest conscious- 
ness of the sources and development of the culture we enjoy. ... . 
It makes a man more a man, the more he knows of what men afore- 
time have borne and done and thought. The most practical man, 
in the final survey of human life, is the one who puts the emphasis on 
man and not on practical; who is never too absorbed in the cares 
and triumphs of life to ask himself soberly now and then: ‘What 
shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own 
soul ?””

  CHAPTER III 
CLASSICAL STUDIES ON THE DEFENSIVE 
Searching criticism of the classics..—-At the very outset 
the young Latin teacher must know something of the storm 
of criticism through which classical studies have passed 
within recent years. Many strong friends of the classics 
have had their confidence shaken not a little by the bold 
opposition on the one hand, and the rather timid reticence 
of classical teachers on the othet hand. However, there 
have been strong defenders who have done splendid service 
in the cause of sane education, and to them is due, in no 
small measure, the forceful defense which eventually 
resulted in.a partial victory. In order that young teachers 
may know something of the attacks made upon classical 
studies in the schools, the main opponents and their argu- 
ments are here noted, and, in turn, criticized: 
1. Promoters of educational fads——The faddist has 
always been the most uncompromising foe of Latin and 
Greek. He has an idea which will revolutionize education, 
but foolish people wili not accept it immediately, because 
they are busy with something else! If they would only 
turn from these dead languages and take his fad instead, 
the world would blossom as the rose! ‘ 
Regular attendants at public educational conventions 
look for “some new thing.” Just how these faddists and 
promoters of educational piffle invariably manage to secure 
the choice places on the programs is rather hard to under- 
stand. They are always on hand, and always they turn 
their little guns on Latin and Greek. They say about the 
19
-P-A-G-E-30
  20 TEACHING HIGH-SCHOOL LATIN 
worst that they know when they call these “dead lan- 
guages” and “‘the fetish of fogyism.” These men are sel- 
dom called to account. In fact, it is very rare that the 
friends of classical learning are given a place on these 
programs. 
However, fads come and go, but Latin abides. Its 
very presence in a high school compels good standards of 
scholarship in other subjects and in this way possibly has 
helped to bring disaster to the various fads. Something 
has had this effect, for anyone who will count up the 
“dead fads” of the past twenty-five years will find that 
their name is legion. 
The young Latin teacher may not hope to convince an 
extremist of this kind. The best one can do is to counter- 
act, in so far as is possible, the temporary effect of such 
extremists. 
2. Friends of the newer subjects —What is said above 
may apply here with equal force, in many instances. Too 
often those who would urge the newer subjects on our 
schools seem to think that they can secure a place only by 
removing Latin from the list of studies offered. This is 
not a very wise or fair proceeding. Latin teachers and the 
friends of the classics generally are as firm friends of the 
newer subjects as are their most earnest promoters, in so 
far as they have proved themselves worthy of a place in the 
curriculum. Some, as for instance, in the domestic and 
strictly technical arts, have done this excellently, while 
others are still in the experimental stage and will never 
get beyond it, regardless of the place of classical studies 
or anything else. Latin has sought no quarrel even with 
the most doubtful of the newer subjects. Latin teachers 
know that not every pupil can succeed in Latin study.
-P-A-G-E-31
  
CLASSICAL STUDIES ON THE DEFENSIVE ar 
Some minds are best adapted to strictly technical and 
manual effort, and should be guided in that direction. 
Such subjects should have fair treatment, but this does not 
mean that Latin should quietly submit to unfair treatment. 
3. Friends of the modern languages—Some years ago, 
when the modern languages began to be taken seriously 
as fit subjects for the high schools, some controversy 
naturally arose between the defenders of the modern lan- 
guages and those of the classics, which were in a measure 
displaced in favor of the newer languages. This has prac- 
tically disappeared, in so far as the teachers of these sub- 
jects are concerned. Now and then, however, someone 
brings to the front one of the long-discarded arguments 
for displacing the classics with German and French, and 
for this reason these arguments must be examined. 
The one most commonly used, and the least understood, 
is that of utility. “‘These young people should study 
German and French, for they may have a chance to use 
it in talking with the natives.” / To state an argument 
in this way is to expose its futility. Perhaps they may, 
but most likely they will not have any need to talk with 
native Germans and Frenchmen. Suppose they do, then 
what? Must they study for four years or more in order 
to be able to talk a little, and badly, with a native who gets 
keen amusement out of the blunderers? Invariably such 
linguists must have recourse to their English to explain 
just what they are trying to say. More than that, it is 
fair to say that outside of the great cities not one high- 
school student in ten ever thinks of trying to talk in a 
foreign language, even if he has a chance. If he needs a 
frankfurter, or a cheese, or something else from a store kept 
by a foreigner, he calls for it just as he would if he had
-P-A-G-E-32
  22 TEACHING HIGH-SCHOOL LATIN 
never heard of any except his native tongue. Such 
“sprechen Sie” German and “‘parlez-vous” French have 
no established educational value. ‘ 
But suppose that the foreign languages, German and 
French, for instance, are taught primarily with a view to 
their fluent use. What is achieved then? Cannot the 
waiters at the larger hotels speak several languages under- 
standingly? Are they to be counted as bright particular 
stars on this account? If we are making the conversational 
factor of prime importance, we might secure more satis- 
factory results by sending our young men and young women 
to France or Germany for a few months, for this is practi- 
tically the only way to get a conversational grasp of a 
foreign language. 
The fact is, our schools do not turn out graduates who 
have a working knowledge of the languages which they 
have studied. If modern languages are a, utility only in so 
far as they are spoken by those who study them, they are 
a failure. For many years they have had a choice place in 
the school curriculum, and, except for a few short sentences, 
those who have studied German and French know no more 
of them as conversational languages than Latin pupils 
know of conversational Latin. Let the reader make a test 
of the people who were in school with him and studied the 
modern languages while he studied Latin. 
However, modern-language teachers do not now stress 
the conversational factor to any large extent. They are 
gradually approaching the methods long used in teaching 
ancient languages, that is, striving to train the language- 
sense, to secure accuracy in expression and interpretation, 
to awaken sympathy with what is best in the world’s store 
of learning, art, and literature, and to develop in the student 
 
-P-A-G-E-33
  CLASSICAL STUDIES ON THE DEFENSIVE 23 
a feeling of “‘at-homeness”’ in the atmosphere of the best 
thought and endeavor of all the ages. As these purposes 
become established, the very question of conversational 
language is lost from the reckoning. Whether these ends 
can be secured better by using one of the two ancient 
languages, or one of the main modern languages, may be 
left for others to decide. The evidence in favor of the 
classics seems overwhelming. 
From this it is plain that modern-language teaching is 
not very different from ancient-language teaching. If we 
may believe the evidence furnished by Professor W. R. 
Price, state inspector of modern languages in New York, 
given in the School Review, XXII, 98-102, many of those 
who teach modern languages in the high schools are poorly 
prepared indeed. 
The interests of the ancient and the modern languages 
are very similar, in fact identical. If the philistine could 
drive Latin out of the schools, German and French would 
go out early the next day thereafter. Latin teachers should 
recognize the value of modern languages and should 
encourage those pupils with whom they have influence to 
get all the German and French for which they can find time. 
4. Friends of the sciences —The situation of the sciences 
is much like that of the modern languages. Some few 
friends of the sciences, especially teachers whose own 
training has been narrow and has limited their vision, have 
even advocated violent measures. They have urged that 
the classics be cast out entirely, and that the work of 
éducating the young be handed over to them. To their 
thinking, utility is the end of education, and their state- 
ment of the case of the classics shows these subjects to be 
worse than useless. Latin is not in the group of utility 
 
-P-A-G-E-34
  24 TEACHING HIGH-SCHOOL LATIN 
subjects, nor is anything else which is not immediately 
serviceable in making a living! 
We were told that the sciences were utility subjects. 
The public accepted the arguments, and, while Latin was 
not removed from the schools, large room was made for 
the sciences. Large sums of money were devoted to science 
departments, fine laboratories were equipped, and every 
demand made by the teachers had a very friendly hearing. 
That science teaching has been of great service in the high 
schools, within recent years, we are all glad to acknowledge. 
That it has done all the wonderful things which were 
promised, no one believes; that science in the high schools 
has proved a wtility—-the great service which was promised 
—is wholly without any foundation. 
In the very nature of the case, the sciences are a utility 
only to those who work along applied lines, and thus keep 
step with the advances and changing theories of the author- 
ities. As a test of this statement, Jet the man who studied 
physics or chemistry thirty years ago compare his old text 
with a recent text on that subject. His old text is out of 
date, utterly absurd, and even dangerous. The science 
of thirty years ago, or of twenty, or even of ten, is a “‘dead 
science,” and no language ever looked so dead as does 
“dead science.” 
In actual school work, science has as many shortcomings 
as Latin or anything else. High-school pupils are not 
proving themselves active or efficient investigators. Gen- 
erally they do the required work in just as dull and heavy ° 
a way as they study their foreign language. In too many 
cases, they work for credit toward graduation and think 
very little about original investigation. The danger of 
relying too largely upon the sciences as educational instru-
-P-A-G-E-35
  CLASSICAL STUDIES ON THE DEFENSIVE 25 
ments in the high schools is well set forth in the following 
passage from an address by Professor E. A. Hayden: 
Laboratory experiments multiplied beyond all reason; labora- 
tory manuals so minute in their specifications that no place is left 
to the student for that effort and rumination which is indispensable 
to the growth of strong mental tissue; inadequate mathematical 
preparation for physics that makes the subject largely a juggling 
of apparatus and mechanical application of predigested formulae 
to concrete data; geometry boiled down until its real essence and 
spirit—the intuitive apprehension of spatial magnitudes—is com- 
pletely volatilized—these are a few of the results of this feverish 
passion for obvious external results. Mere activity, mere busyness 
that expends itself in tinkering with an infinitude of trifling details, 
is a sheer waste of time and energy. 
Reference may be made here, with great timeliness, 
to an experience in the history of education in Germany. 
In 1870 the German government asked the University of 
Berlin to consider the admission of graduates of the 
Realschule to the university on equal terms with those of 
the Gymnasium, whose training is based largely on the 
classics, indicating in this request that the Realschule 
afforded an equivalent preparation for advanced study. 
The philosophical faculty replied— 
that the non-classical training is incapable of furnishing a preparation 
for academic studies equal to that afforded by classical training; 
that all efforts to find a substitute for the classical languages, whether 
in mathematics, or in the modern languages, or in the natural sciences, 
have hitherto been unsuccessful; that after long and vain search 
we must come back finally to the result of centuries of experience, that 
the surest instrument that can be used in the training of the minds 
of the youth is given to us in the languages, the literature, and the 
works of art of classical antiquity. 
In spite of this, the government opened up the univer- 
sities to the graduates of these technical high schools.
-P-A-G-E-36
  
26 TEACHING HIGH-SCHOOL LATIN 
After ten years of experimenting, the entire faculty, 
professors of natural and physical sciences included, 
declared that in spite of the start gained in scientific study 
by the graduates of the technical schools, they were speedily 
overtaken by the graduates of the classical institutions, 
and left in the rear. The entire faculty petitioned the 
government to repeal its decree and to admit to the uni- 
versity only such students as had received the training of 
the classics, as the only adequate training for university 
study. On this petition were the names of Liebig, Helm- 
holtz, Hoffmann, Rammelsberg, Mommsen, Curtius, and 
others of equal fame.t 
From this discussion it must not be inferred that the 
writer is opposed to the teaching of the sciences in our 
schools. He believes most strongly in these subjects as 
educational instruments. Notwithstanding all that has 
been said about the possibilities of science instruction, the 
results seem to fall very far short. The sciences should 
hold a place in the high-school course, and our young 
people should study science, utility or no utility. No one 
can pretend to have an education who does not know 
something of science, but he must be prepared to unlearn 
it every few years, in the very nature of the case. 
The teachers of Latin are as good friends of the sciences 
as can be found, notwithstanding the effort to alienate 
them. Fora kind of training which is essential, that which 
leads to habits of investigation and patient searching after 
facts in a given case and of following them to their definite 
conclusion, the sciences when properly taught have a 
place that nothing else can fill, When it comes to training 
in chaste and accurate expression of the facts ascertained, 
tMiller, Southern Educational Review, IV, 100.
-P-A-G-E-37
  
CLASSICAL STUDIES ON THE DEFENSIVE 27. 
the sciences can do very little, and must give this task 
over to subjects which are known to secure this very result. 
Both the sciences and the foreign languages have fields 
ready at hand, with work rather definitely outlined. 
Students in the classics should be encouraged to get all 
the science courses possible, and teachers of the sciences 
who are thinking of the interests of their pupils, rather than 
of petty wrangles about the utility of science, will urge upon 
their classes the claims of the languages, ancient and 
modern. 
5. Other objections. — 
a) “A waste of time”: This is an objection which can 
be made only by those who do not know what is done by 
the various subjects taught in the schools, and it holds 
about as well against one subject as another. Reducing the 
matter to the last word, we all know that men have lived and 
done well without knowing anything about Latin, as they 
have done without a knowledge of grammar, arithmetic, 
algebra, geometry, or even of reading and writing. This is, 
however, very poor evidence to show that they would not 
have done better if they had learned these things at the 
right time. In fact, if we take out all the subjects which 
may seem unnecessary, that is, which have no direct bearing 
on making a living, and then take from the others the parts 
which are of no practical use, we shall haye very little left. 
Take mathematics, for instance. The average business man 
has little use for anything beyond simple arithmetic, and no 
use for much of that. If he buys, the seller furnishes the 
figures by which he must pay, and even he uses a form book 
in which the prices are all worked out. If he sells, he uses 
the ready-made tables. If he goes to the bank, the cashier 
turns to his form book and the transaction is completed.
-P-A-G-E-38
  28 TEACHING HIGH-SCHOOL LATIN 
His adding is done by a machine, and his dictaphone and 
typewriter remove the necessity of his knowing anything 
more than how and where to stamp his name with a rubber 
stamp. What need then has the average business man 
for difficult arithmetic, or algebra, or plane or solid geom- 
etry, to say nothing of higher mathematics? More than 
this, one of the great civil engineers of the country recently 
stated that he had gone over his old texts in mathematics 
to find out just how much of the mathematics he studied 
in school had been used in his actual experience as head of 
the engineering department of one of the great railway 
systems. He made the amazing statement that every- 
thing he had used, of all the mathematics he had studied, 
could be given in a booklet of about twenty-four pages. It 
is doubtful whether he could have grasped and retained 
this essential knowledge without the training he had 
received in dealing with what he considers the nonessential 
part. His feeling that he could have done so makes his 
contribution all the more interesting. 
This reasoning holds of other subjects, such as physics, 
chemistry, history, English, geography, and the like. We 
may as well understand that there is no intention, in any 
sane educational system, of cramming into a pupil the few 
data necessary for earning a livelihood. This is not the 
great task of the schools. One needs a trained mind in 
order to be able to make intelligent use of these rules, 
tables, and similar data; and to give this trained mind, 
we have found nothing better suited than mathematics, 
physics, chemistry, and the like. 
Latin does require time, but the time is not wasted. 
' Education is a growth, not a list of tables and schedules. 
Time is necessary, and it is the task of the educator to
-P-A-G-E-39
  
CLASSICAL STUDIES ON THE DEFENSIVE 29 
plan for the use of this time so as to secure the best results 
in trained efficiency. The time element must have fair 
consideration in any educational scheme. 
Young America, they tell us, is in a hurry, and he wants 
a short route to the educational goal. He does not object 
especially to an education if he can get it on the run and 
painlessly. Even good business men scold the schools for 
holding young men so long, while electricity and flying- 
machines are moving things in terms of miles in place of the 
rods of other days. Sane education recognizes the fact — 
that while some things have surpassed the rate of progress 
of a hundred years ago, still seedtime and harvest are now 
just as far apart as they were in the leisurely days of old 
Methuselah, the seasons are the same, and the period of 
physical development is the same. Some processes cannot 
be hastened without great loss. Mental processes, mental 
development require time, time, time, and there is no 
escape from the fact. It has been well said that when the 
Almighty wants to make a gourd he needs but a few days 
or weeks, but when he wants the giant oak of the forest 
he needs years and even centuries. It takes more time to 
educate the whole man than it does merely to train the hand 
to move accurately through space and to do its mechanical 
duty. But the whole man when educated is not dependent 
for life’s enjoyment upon any outside world; he has a world, 
he is a world of himself, and stands, of all creation, nearest 
in kind to his Maker. 
Dean Bagley, of the University of Illinois, has well said: 
Another insidious notion is that what we call general or liberal 
education is needed only by those who are going into the professions; 
that workers in the industrial, agricultural, and commercial fields 
do not need the kind of culture that the general and liberal work of
-P-A-G-E-40
  
30 TEACHING HIGH-SCHOOL LATIN 
the seventh and eighth grades and the high school is supposed to 
represent—that instruction in history, in geography, in literature, is 
really vocational educational, preparing for the ‘“white-collar” 
occupations. And so we have the proposals for differentiated courses 
in history, and we have proposals for even experiments in the teach- 
ing of English which would relegate the great masterpieces to the 
white-collar pupils, and feed those destined for other callings 
on the inspiring contents of powey bulletins and mail- order 
catalogues. .... 
Most of those who advocate early vocational differentiation are 
not thinking of their own children. Of course a broad and liberal 
training is presupposed for them. These opportunities for early 
vocational choices are for other people’s children. . . . . 
In the last analysis, the efficiency of our educational system de- 
pends upon the capacity of our boys and girls to do “hard, uncoaxed, 
uncomplimented work willingly and heartily.” 
In our educational theory we have certainly gone too far, and 
educational practice has gone about as far as it is safe to venture 
without a counteracting movement. In my opinion, the time is 
ripe for a little tincture of iron in our educational philosophy; for a 
touch of a more virile idealism; for a renaissance of thoroughness and 
a reasonable measure of rigor; for something approaching a revival of 
the ideals of duty and effort. 
6) “The task and the returns are out of proportion” 
That depends on the point of view and the general attitude 
of the person interested. Latin does require good hard 
work, but that is one of its strongest points in a schedule 
of studies. A disposition to substitute easy, namby- 
pamby subjects for those which require hard, persistent 
effort is unfortunately gaining support, notwithstanding 
the fact that this kind of school work will certainly turn 
out a crude and namby-pamby product. Some pupils 
clamor for the easy, predigested material, but the majority

of those who complete the high-school course recognize the 
importance of hard work and are willing to apply themselves 
to it. ’ 
(For real education there is no hope short of hard and 
unremitting effort.\ The way to scholarship is rugged 
and steep. Any”promise of culture that is not based 
upon hard work is a snare and a delusion. There is no 
education that is worth while which does not demand 
patient, determined, ceaseless endeavor, coupled with a 
persistent concentration of all the mental powers upon 
the task in hand. Few subjects so completely réquire 
this sustained effort as does Latin, and few give in 
return such generous rewards when the work is over. 
An evidence of this is seen in the long-continued service 
it has rendered to the cause of education in the centuries 
past, and in the strong and abiding faith of the world’s 
great scholars in Latin as an effective agent in their own 
education. 
c) “One subject is as good as another, and Latin is no 
exception’’: It has been boldly argued that one subject is 
just as good as another; that no matter what one studies, 
it all amounts to the same, just so that he is studying. 
This is brother to the idea, equally sane and balanced, that 
no matter what one eats, it is all the same, just so that he is 
eating. Physical disaster in the one case is no more certain 
and sure than is mental disaster in the other. 
In addition to what we have said about unrestricted 
election, it is in place to say that there are sane and sensible 
means which are known to be capable of producing desirable 
ends in education. As the prospective dentist has little 
to hope for from a study of submarine navigation, and ought 
not to feel that this study could serve his purpose, so one 
 
-P-A-G-E-42
  
32: TEACHING HIGH-SCHOOL LATIN 
who is seeking for a well-developed mind, a well-rounded 
education ought not to hope that he can reach his end by 
the use of means which common-sense wholly rejects. 
What he needs is such subjects and in such combinations 
as will in a given time evenly develop the mental powers 
with which he is endowed; and he should strenuously avoid 
such subjects and such combinations as will, in the light 
of human reason, defeat his purpose. Common-sense and 
common utility demand that his main dependence should 
be upon subjects that have been tested, that have a litera- 
ture of permanent value; and that are available in a suffi- 
ciently organized and usable form for the purpose in hand. 
There are some subjects which never can have any genuine 
literature of their own, and consequently have no possi- 
bility of taking a permanent place in education. Some 
of these are valuable arts in themselves, and we cannot 
get along without them; but they offer nothing in the way 
of mental development, other than in the little of theory 
which lies back of them, and in the concentration necessary 
until reflex action has taken hold of the situation. Other- 
wise 6ur cotton mills, sweatshops, and bakeries would be 
ranked as great universities and centers of human learning. 
Skill is one thing and entirely different from culture and 
real education. 
d) “I studied Latin and have forgotten all about it’’: 
Every now and then this man shows up. He studied Latin 
of course, but of course he forgot it. He is ready to give 
a good account of his other subjects, if we may follow out 
his suggestion. His mathematics, chemistry, history, 
physics—all these and more he remembers! Generally, the 
man who talks in this fashion suffered from a poor teacher 
or was himself a very indifferent student—possibly both
-P-A-G-E-43
  CLASSICAL STUDIES ON THE DEFENSIVE 83 
explanations apply. His very complaint is in fact a lament, 
as is well stated by Professor Shorey.’ 
It has been said of the most polished writer in America 
that his matchless style is “the product of forgotten toil.” 
The man who would undertake to say that his Latin study 
did not do him a large service, simply because he cannot 
recall any of the lines of the texts he read, certainly has 
small claim on our consideration. He is simply hunting 
for an argument where there is none. 
The situation less disturbed of late.—In another place 
it has been stated that less is now said against the classics 
than formerly, but the foregoing still represent the stock 
arguments which have been urged. There may be more 
complete answers than those offered, but even these seem 
fairly satisfactory. A reason for the comparative quiet 
may be the fact that the monopoly which Latin was accused 
of holding has been surrendered, or else broken up, so 
that in all the high schools pupils may take a substitute 
if they wish. 
Controversy not desirable.—Latin teachers of high- 
school grade are generally timid about undertakihg a 
defense of the classics when they are assailed, and this is 
natural, in view of the fact that they are not often in full 
possession of the facts. However, some of the data given 
in this book, such as the statistics, may serve a good 
purpose and silence agitators when debate would be useless. 
On the other hand, the high-school teachers naturally 
look to the professors in the colleges and universities to 
investigate the situation and to secure the facts which will 
enable them to answer the educational “experts” and 
others who now and then offer public objection to the

classics. At least three of the great universities, through 
their classical faculties, have done most valuable work of 
this kind. It is hoped that others will become equally 
active, for they cannot afford to be silent while educational 
leadership is taken over by those who would carry out a 
program which is both revolutionary and destructive.
-P-A-G-E-45
CHAPTER IV 
THE TEACHER AND HIS SUBJECT 
Select your subject.—The high schools of this country 
are commonly so organized that teachers are employed to 
teach one or two of the subjects offered in the course of 
study, rather than all the subjects of a grade or year. 
This arrangement encourages special preparation on the: 
part of the teacher and should secure for the school a high 
grade of service. It is therefore of the largest importance 
that the prospective teacher decide as early as possible 
on the subject or subjects which appeal to him most 
strongly and which he thinks he can teach most effec- 
tively. Frequently those who look forward to teaching 
find it necessary to defer this decision until after they 
have taught for awhile and have had time to make up 
their minds definitely. In such cases, the delay cannot 
be avoided, but the pupils taught by a hesitating teacher 
and the subjects used in his experiments will necessarily 
suffer. 
Who should teach a foreign language ?—In making his 
selection from the number of subjects taught in the high 
schools, several considerations must have due weight. 
A slow, hesitating young man, if he teaches at all, should 
not undertake foreign-language teaching, in which quick- 
ness of thought and expression are absolutely necessary. 
Also, one who has found foreign languages a difficult study 
and has made unsatisfactory progress in this kind of work 
should not feel called upon to teach a foreign language, 
Latin in particular, in later years. 
35
-P-A-G-E-46
  
36 TEACHING HIGH-SCHOOL LATIN 
Many young people are blessed with what teachers 
like to call “the language sense,” “a feeling for language,” 
which may mean that they naturally think quickly and 
connectedly and have a memory which retains readily and 
permanently. Young teachers who have this advantage, 
and with it a “ genius for hard work,”’ have the natural quali- 
fications which make the successful teacher of Latin. 
Many who are only moderately endowed in these particulars 
achieve great things as teachers, by vigorous effort and 
close application--a fact which offers encouragement to 
those who are willing ‘to pay the price in persistent 
endeavor. 
The study of Latin and other foreign languages will 
prove helpful to those who are slow in language work, but 
if such students ever turn to teaching they should seek 
subjects which more readily adapt themselves to their own 
mental aptitude. They may have some strength in close 
and careful reasoning, in industrious pursuit of details, in 
manual dexterity, and these qualities may possibly be 
turned to good account in teaching one or more of the 
sciences. However, it is safe to say that a slow student 
should not be encouraged to think that the world needs his 
services in the capacity of a teacher. 
Hard work will achieve wonders, especially if there is a 
strong personality back of the effort. To achieve the best 
results, the teacher must be happy in his work. To be 
happy, he must have the subject which suits him best, 
which fits in best with his natural inclination and thus calls 
out the best that isin him. For one who likes Latin as a 
subject, and likes to teach it, likes to use it as an educational 
instrument, nothing else can quite take its place or so com- 
pletely occupy his “mind, soul, and strength.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-47
  
THE TEACHER AND HIS SUBJECT 37 
Believe in your subject.—No matter what his natural 
bent, or his training, the Latin teacher cannot do his best 
work unless he has a fixed faith in the efficiency of his sub- 
ject as a means to an end. One who tries to teach any 
subject in a half-hearted way is doing a positive wrong to 
those who are unfortunate enough to be forced to suffer 
at his hands. The young Latin teacher should make an 
investigation into the facts of the case and know what has 
been accomplished by Latin in the centuries past and what 
is now being done. In addition to this, he should watch 
the work of his own classes with a view to building up his 
faith in the effectiveness of Latin in his own hands. A 
Latin teacher who knows what he is expected to do with 
Latin, and knows that he can do that very thing, is bound 
to secure the best results possible. 
School officers careless.—-Occasionally conditions are 
met with in which the preferences and special fitness of the 
teachers do not determine assignments, as when school 
officers allow family connection and political alignments 
to influence, to some extent, their choice of teachers. In a 
group of teachers elected thus and turned over to the prin- 
cipal for assignments, there may be no one who is prepared 
to do good work in Latin. Teachers who depend upon 
local influence for appointments are not the kind who make 
preparation for teaching anything in particular, Latin 
least of all. The teacher who has Latin thus thrust upon 
him, despite his utter unpreparedness for teaching it, is 
likely to become rebellious, and his attitude will add greatly 
to the burdens of Latin. Parents and pupils naturally con- 
nect the subject and the teacher, every weakness of the 
teacher being placed to the account of the subject which he 
teaches.
-P-A-G-E-48
  38 TEACHING HIGH-SCHOOL LATIN 
Under such circumstances Latin is helpless. Some 
subjects are self-protecting and warn off intruders. Chem- 
istry, for instance, if tampered with, may explode and 
blow embodied ignorance through the roof. Latin has 
no such protection, and its only hope is that when it is 
thus burdened some bright pupils will take hold of the 
situation and hold the class together. Otherwise the time 
of the class is wasted. 
This is an extreme condition and ought not to be possible 
anywhere, but those who know the weaker high schools 
know to what extent nepotism and politics have operated 
in keeping them weak. 
Teachers sometimes at fault——It happens all too 
frequently that teachers accept positions in the high schools 
for which they are not properly prepared. | Latin has 
suffered in this particular. No one should undertake to 
teach the usual four years of Latin who has not done at 
least that amount of work under a competent teacher. No 
high school should employ for this work any teacher who 
has not had some college Latin, in addition to the four years 
in the high school. This reasonable minimum is not always 
adhered to. Other subjects suffer as well, possibly to an 
even greater extent than Latin does, and there should be 
some protection against mistakes of this kind. 
Latin teachers needed.—Now and then schools which 
offer Latin cannot get well-trained teachers and are forced 
to make way for incompetent teachers, or else to leave out 
Latin for the time being. The latter course is decidedly 
preferable to using a teacher who does not know the subject 
and consequently cannot teach it. There is always a 
strong demand for high-school teachers who are able to 
teach Latin in such a way as to get results, and those who 
 
-P-A-G-E-49
THE TEACHER AND HIS SUBJECT 39 
are looking toward teaching as a life-work may safely 
prepare themselves for teaching this subject, provided they 
have the qualifications which have been mentioned as 
furnishing a basis for Latin teaching. The young teacher 
who takes Latin as his main subject should also prepare 
himself to teach one other subject that may readily be 
related to Latin, such as German, or French, or history 
or possibly English, according to his preferences. As 
stated above, many high schools require a teacher to take 
more than one branch of learning, and such a combination 
will prove a safe investment of money and of strength. 
Push the Latin, but be fair.--Circumstances of late 
years have made it almost necessary for the young Latin 
teacher to push his work rather vigorously, in order to 
prevent unfair discrimination. This is not true of all high 
schools, but of those in some sections only. The Latin 
teacher must see that the work for which he is responsible 
does not suffer, but there is danger that in his efforts he 
may become rather intolerant toward other subjects, 
especially toward those whose supporters frequently 
declaim against Latin study. He must be on his guard 
against this narrowness, for he might prove little better than 
the faddist, of whom nothing but intolerance and narrow- 
ness need be expected. ‘The Latin teacher must do high- 
grade work in his own department and see to it that his 
pupils get the best that is in him; but he must be fair to 
all other subjects and to the teachers of these, and must 
show just appreciation of the work done in all the other 
departments. Latin cannot do the whole work of educa- 
tion; it must stand shoulder to shoulder with every other 
subject which can be used in the task. of educating young 
men and young women.  
-P-A-G-E-50
CHAPTER V 
THE TRAINING OF THE LATIN TEACHER 
Prepare to teach the subject you have selected.— 
After the young teacher has selected his subject, it becomes 
his duty to prepare himself as thoroughly as he can for the 
work he is todo. He is especially fortunate if he can make 
his decision early in his college course. 
Latin teachers must know Latin.—In some subjects a 
teacher may be able to keep up appearances without 
knowing very much about his work, but Latin is not one 
of these. The teacher either knows Latin or does not, and 
thé weakest pupil in his class will not be long in finding out 
the truth. A knowledge of the language and literature is 
an absolute necessity. and there is no way of dodging this 
demand. Efforts at: teaching Latin without a sufficient 
knowledge invariably bring confusion and disaster, as 
many a teacher can testify. While yet in college, the young 
teacher should take every course in Latin that he can, and 
should get as much Greek as he can find time for, as Greek 
is an éssential factor in good Latin teaching. 
Latin teachers must know how to teach Latin.—In 
\ addition to an accurate knowledge of the subject-matter, 
it is important to be able to teach it in an effective manner. 
Very few are “born teachers”; most of those who imagine 
that they are have little evidence to back their claims. 
The great majority may do fairly well at first, if they know 
the subject, but their teaching is largely experimental, 
until, after much experience, they find the best ways and 
means of teaching. There is no good reason, however, . 
40  
-P-A-G-E-51
  TRAINING OF THE LATIN TEACHER 41 
why the right training beforehand should not shorten the 
period of experimenting and fit them for satisfactory work 
from the start. 
Professor Bennett’s caution.—The following caution 
against emphasizing “method” is offered by Professor 
Bennett: 
T have elsewhere called attention to what seems to me a dangerous 
inference, likely to be drawn, and certainly not infrequently drawn, 
in connection with modern pedagogy; and I may perhaps not be 
departing too far from my theme if I say again that teaching is not 
the application of a method, but that, as Quintilian reminds us, it is 
a constant adaptation to the problem momentarily in hand. It is 
the very reverse of anything and everything mechanical. It there- 
fore does not submit to the definite formulation of a method capable 
of general application. The two essentials of the teacher are a knowl- 
edge of his subject and skill in momentary adaptation. Accordingly, 
when I note the prodigious emphasis placed on “method” in prepara- 
tion for the profession of teaching, I feel warranted in saying that such 
emphasis is of doubtful wisdom, since it involves the assumption 
that knowledge is of less account than method, that method either 
necessarily carries with it capacity for the skilful adaptation requisite 
in teaching, or is even superior to it.t 
This caution of Professor Bennett against overstress- 
ing “method” is very timely. There is a disposition, 
particularly strong in teacher-training institutions, to 
make ‘‘method” the center of interest, the natural con- 
sequence being a subordination of real scholarship. Where 
“method” becomes a substitute for scholarship, or for a 
knowledge of the subject to be taught, it is a dangerous and 
reprehensible thing. In this connection, we are advocating 
an entirely different. kind of method. The prospective 
teacher who knows his subject should have some training 
in the art of presenting it, so that from the very beginning 
* Classical Journal, IV, 162.  
-P-A-G-E-52
  
42 TEACHING HIGH-SCHOOL LATIN 
of his work with his classes he may be able to do reasonable 
justice to his pupils and to his subject. He may acquire 
this skill as a result of practicing upon his classes until he 
has his resources well in hand. A much better way would 
be for him to make a study of the problems connected with 
teaching Latin—in this case, under the direction of one 
who is both a successful teacher and an accomplished 
scholar. The young teacher who has ‘“‘a knowledge of the 
subject” and “skill in momentary adaptation,” along with 
others not half so fortunate, will profit greatly by such 
training. There is no reason for fearing that this plan 
' will prove anything but helpful. If the young teacher is 
naturally conservative, he will at least have good models 
to follow instead of the poor ones of his own high-school 
years; if he is naturally progressive, what he learns will 
not hamper him nor prevent his improving on what his 
instructor has taught him. 
Better teaching a necessity—The stronger private 
schools and the high schools of the larger cities are fortunate 
in being able generally to secure good teachers for all their 
subjects. The problem is to find strong, well-equipped 
teachers for Latin in the weaker high schools, many of 
which pay reasonable salaries but of course salaries not 
equal to those paid in the cities. These schools, however, 
have more than half the pupils who are studying high-school 
branches, and other subjects besides Latin are poorly 
taught. It is probable that Latin is as well taught as any 
thing else in the majority of these institutions; but when 
Latin is poorly taught, or is in the hands of an incom- 
petent teacher, its burden is increased, and faults appear 
which in fact do not belong to Latin, as has been said 
elsewhere.
-P-A-G-E-53
  TRAINING OF THE LATIN TEACHER 43 
It is an evidence of the “final perseverance” of Latin, 
if we may so call it, that, notwithstanding the poor results 
too often secured in such schools, and the general suscep- 
tibility of the average school board to the demand for the 
practical, fathers and mothers still believe in Latin and 
insist that their sons and daughters shall have an opportu- 
nity to study it during their high-school course. This faith 
should be honored by an earnest effort on the part of colleges 
and universities to prepare a sufficient supply of teachers 
to meet the demand. It certainly behooves those who are 
high-priests in the classical temple to stir their young 
novices to a fuller preparation, and themselves to furnish 
the best possible models for the hundreds who in devoted 
allegiance crowd about their altars. Some of the best 
Latin teaching done in this country is done in the larger 
colleges and. universities—and also some of the poorest. 
That Latin has survived the deadening effect of poor teach- 
ing in such surroundings is abundant evidence of its “final 
perseverance.” 
We must have trained teachers.—Our colleges and 
universities can readily do a large service by pushing 
vigorously this preparation of teachers for the high schools. 
There are no reasons for the training of a teacher for any 
kind of work that do not apply quite as well to those who 
are to do the work in Latin. The cause of Latin, as has 
been indicated elsewhere, is to a large extent bound up 
with the question of better Latin teaching. If we can get 
good teachers, or, rather, a larger supply of the kind who 
make Latin interesting and profitable, we shall cease to 
hear anything said about leaving Latin out of our schools. 
Suggestions for a course for teachers.—Several col- 
leges and universities are now offering courses designed to
-P-A-G-E-54
  44 TEACHING HIGH-SCHOOL LATIN 
give Latin teachers some training such as has been indi- 
cated. These courses naturally vary, some of them being 
of more practical value than others. Without trying to 
mark out a complete program, emphasis may be placed 
upon the following features: 
_ixThe place and value of Latin in an educational sys- 
tem.—A teacher cannot succeed with a subject of the value 
of which he is uninformed. Latin can do its part in educa- 
tion and nothing more. The evidence of experience, as 
given in Professor Kelsey’s Latin and Greek in American 
Education, is very essential. Other volumes of a somewhat 
similar character will contribute largely, such as Ashmore’s 
The Classics and Modern Training, Babbitt’s Literature 
and the American College, and Harrington’s Live Issues in 
Classical Study. 
Ax-The exact work which the teacher is to_undertake.— 
The teacher of Latin has a narrower task which may be 
laid out within very exact lines, that is, teaching the subject 
so that his pupils will thoroughly understand the language 
and the literature in so far as the high-school course extends. 
There is also a larger service which Latin can accomplish 
in the making of men and women. In the hands of a skil- 
ful teacher no other subject can be made to contribute 
so largely to the real education of young people. This 
larger field of service which Latin has always held should be 
well understood by the young teacher, in order that he may 
measure up to his opportunities. 
FF roctlonisy with the high-school authors The class- 
should re-read rapidly the three authors commonly studied 
in the high schools, or equivalents for these. In this work 
the instructor should show by actual demonstration the 
best methods of presenting the subject. The various books
-P-A-G-E-55
  TRAINING OF THE LATIN TEACHER 45° 
which bear on each author should be examined carefully, 
and there should be a fair degree of familiarity with the 
bibliography of the authors read. 
4 Training in the collection and use of collateral material. 
—wWhen the teacher has listened to the reading of a chapter 
from Caesar and criticized the reader, only a small part of 
the hour’s work has been done. That is not Latin teaching. 
Even after the translation is over, after all forms have been 
reviewed and the constructions reported on, the work is 
not over. The teacher who knows what collateral material 
is available for awakening the interest of his class, and then 
collects that material for actual use, will never fail to get 
good results in his drills on forms and constructions, or 
in other hard work. A careless teacher objects to this as 
unnecessary, but herein lies the real teacher’s oppor- 
tunity to make his teaching touch ordinary life. (Pupils 
may forget the sentences read, but they will not forget 
the story of old Appius Claudius, or the picture of the 
Pantheon, or the little song sung in Latin. These things 
are worth while. This part of. the course should include 
a working familiarity with Sandys’ Companion to Latin 
Studies, which is the best of the volumes of this kind 
available/ 
x Practice teaching during the year—Not much can 
be said in favor of this from the viewpoint of those prac- 
ticed on, but if the college is so organized that prospective 
teachers of Latin can teach under competent supervision 
for awhile, this practice will prove very helpful. Probably 
the pupils who are thus taught will be so protected by the 
critic teacher in charge that they will not be injured more 
than they would be at the hands of the ordinary untrained 
teacher.
-P-A-G-E-56
46 TEACHING HIGH-SCHOOL LATIN 
These are merely suggestions as to some things which 
may be made the basis of investigation during the course 
and have the advantage of a successful test. 
Self-trained teachers.—A large majority of our Latin 
teachers decided upon Latin teaching after they finished 
their college course, or else did their work in a college which 
offered no opportunity to take a course preparatory to 
Latin teaching. Such teachers can do much to supplement 
their own efforts and experience by summer courses in the 
universities, and by closely studying the various books and 
bulletins available on the subject of better Latin teaching. 
A list of some of the best books of this character is given 
elsewhere.

CHAPTER VI 
ENGLISH IN LATIN STUDY 
English largely Latin——The English language has 
drawn_so largely upon Latin as a source of words and of | 
ideas that no sane person can fail to see the large possibilities _ 
in the study of Latin for those who speak English. In 
fact, this is generally accepted as one of the strongest 
reasons for retaining Latin in our schools. English 
teacher: ils who have had Latin are not 
only more satisfactory pupils than those who have not 
had it, but that-yearin.and_year out they make decidedly 
higher grades in English." 
A fairly comprehensive statement of this dependence of 
English upon Latin may be given as follows: 
English derived from Latin.— 
1. The vocabulary.—It is estimated that half of the 
words in our largest dictionaries are of Latin origin. Even 
our ordinary words are largely from the Latin, as is estab- 
lished by the following quotations from the Literary Digest 
of January 25, 1913 (‘‘Lexicographer’s Column”’): 
An examination of the origin of nearly 20,000 words in common 
use in different parts of the English-speaking world gives the following

These are words of common use. The more technical 
and “high-sounding”’ words are mainly of classical origin. 
2. The grammar.—Practically all of our grammar has 
been borrowed from the Latin. It therefore seems neces- 
sary to understand the Latin sentence in order to appre- 
ciate our own sentence structure. The teacher of English 
who does not know Latin is seriously handicapped, but 
unfortunately he may not know wherein he fails to measure 
up to his position. 
 
-P-A-G-E-59
  ENGLISH IN LATIN STUDY 49 
3. The literature Classical literature has largely 
furnished the models on which our own literature has been 
built. Not only the general plans have come into our own 
use, but we have taken very largely from the ideas of classi- 
cal writers and shaped them to our needs. Roman and 
Greek characters are constant material for simile and meta- 
phor and other comparison, and we read our own history largely in terms of Greece and Rome. 
This classical current, welcome and refreshing, runs 
through all of our literature that is of value; but in no 
particular is it more easily traced than in the very large use 
of mythological references by our standard authors. 
Mythology in English literature.—A careful investiga- 
tion into the mythological element in a number of the 
English poets has been made under the direction of Pro- 
fessor F. J. Miller, and a numerical count of these references 
has given the following results: Spenser, 650; Byron, 450; 
Shelley, 325; Robert Browning, 250; Tennyson, 225; 
Pope, 175; Mrs. Browning, 175; Matthew Arnold, 100; 
j. G. Saxe, roo. 
More critical studies of these references have been made 
for a few of these writers: e.g., Randall, Sources of Spenser’s 
Classical Mythology; Osgood, Classical Mythology in Milton; 
Root, Classical Mythology in Shakespeare; and Mustard, 
Classical Echoes in Tennyson. The last volume goes beyond 
the mythological element, as the title indicates. Gayley’s 
Classic Myths in English Literature gives a general view of 
this element in our literature. 
Mythology at first hand.—It may be objected that a 
knowledge of mythology can be had without a study of 
the classics. This is partly true, but it is proper to reply 
that unfortunately very few who do not study the classics 
 
-P-A-G-E-60
  50 TEACHING HIGH-SCHOOL LATIN 
give the time and effort necessary for obtaining a knowledge 
of mythology. Even when time and effort are expended, 
the results obtained from such a study of mythology out 
of its natural setting are rudimentary and of comparatively 
little service. Dictionaries, encyclopedias, and handbooks 
of mythology are of easy access, but generally they are not 
used by those who are reading an English author for the 
pleasure of the reading. - Suppose, however, that such. a 
reader should find a reference to some character in mythol- 
ogy and should open his encyclopedia. Take a reference 
to Juno, for instance. He would see her described as “one 
of the goddesses of the Romans, identical with Hera of the 
Greeks, wife and sister of Jupiter,” with possibly something 
more in the same strain. The reader returns to his book 
and takes up the thread of his narrative with this vague 
idea of Juno in mind. But one who has followed Juno 
through the Iliad of Homer and the Aeneid of Vergil has 
another kind of idea of what Juno represents, and he reads 
with this knowledge and gets vastly more out of his reading 
than the one who knows nothing more than what he gets 
from his book of reference. The student of the classics 
is able to enter into the full thought of the writer, and he 
thus really enjoys the larger world which the other reader 
never enters. 
What has been said of mythological references in 
particular holds of classical references in general throughout 
English literature. No writer who knows the history, life, 
and literature of the ancients can fail to make use, now and 
then at least, of the rich illustrative materials so abundantly 
at hand. 
The value of such a knowledge of classical matters is 
readily seen by reverting to the two readers referred to
-P-A-G-E-61
  ENGLISH IN LATIN STUDY 5D 
above. Both read of a “Trojan horse,” “some wily Sinon,”’ 
a real “Sabine farm,” or something of the kind, and from 
the reference book one gets an unsatisfactory explanation— 
if indeed his search for information is rewarded—for he 
may not know where to look; while the other, without 
interruption, finds real delight in the familiar visions which 
are thus brought before him.

PUBLIC TESTIMONY TO THE VALUE OF LATIN STUDY 
The following statistics taken from the reports of the 
United States Commissioner of Education furnish con- 
clusive evidence that Latin is doing a large service in our 
high schools and academies:

In the report for 1889-90, statistics are given on nine 
subjects; for 1899-1900, on eighteen; for 1909-10, on 
twenty-five; for 1914-15, on thirty. These subjects are 
given in the high schools alone, and the statistics are strictly 
for public and private high schools. The list for 1914-15 
is as follows: Latin, Greek, French, German, Spanish, 
algebra, geometry, trigonometry, astronomy, physics, 
chemistry, physical geography, zodlogy, botany, general 
biology, geology, physiology, psychology, rhetoric, English 
literature, history, civil government, civics, agriculture, 
domestic economy, industrial training, manual training, 
drawing, vocal music, bookkeeping.

  VALUE OF LATIN STUDY 53 
A number of these subjects are offered in schools where 
no Latin is taught, as in technical schools. Generally, 
algebra, geometry, rhetoric, English literature, history, 
and some of the sciences are required. Percentages based 
on shifting data are necessarily meaningless. The actual 
numbers more nearly represent the facts in the case. 
Numbers are not the only consideration, however, as school 
officers know that Latin attracts the very best talent in a 
body of students and offers no attraction to weaklings and 
triflers. 
Latin has made its showing without a favored place in 
the curriculum, so far as most high schools are concerned, 
and frequently against the opposition of administrative 
officers. It has, at the most, had a place in a so-called 
“classical course” which is paralleled by a number of other 
courses which lead to the same diploma and which are 
declared to be “equal in value to the classical course.” 
The people of this country believe in Latin. Those who 
seek the best possible training for their children want 
Latin included in the list of subjects which they study.
-P-A-G-E-64
  CHAPTER VIII 
THE TEXT: ITS AUTHOR AND PUBLISHER 
Who should write the text ?—Discussion of this ques- 
tion is not infrequent, the point at issue being whether this 
task can be done better by a college professor or by a high- 
school teacher who is actually teaching the class. 
- It is useless to try to fix any rule in this matter. The 
worth of a text depends upon the man and his adaptability 
to the task in hand rather than upon the mere place which 
he holds. Some college professors have prepared good 
high-school texts and others have prepared very poor ones. 
High-school teachers likewise have records of failure and 
of success. 
The actual working success of a text, apart from success 
due to the activity of its publishers, must depend upon the 
training and experience of the editor and his ability to 
adapt his work to the needs of the classes which use the 
book. Naturally we look to the men who have taught 
Latin successfully as the makers of Latin texts, but we are 
just as likely to be disappointed here as elsewhere. Even 
when the plan is good and is well worked out, the question 
of scholarship may prove a book’s undoing. 
In view of the large number of Latin texts available— 
especially for first-year classes—the great majority of 
which have had no success of consequence, the teacher who 
must decide on a text for his use faces a very serious 
problem. A rather general suggestion as to the editor of a 
satisfactory text is made in this form: In order to secure 
a text that can be depended upon for both scholarship and 
54
-P-A-G-E-65
  THE TEXT: ITS AUTHOR 55 
service, it is safe to use one in which a successful college or 
university professor of Latin has co-operated with a suc- 
cessful teacher of high-school Latin. That is about as 
far as we can go, where all parties to a book venture are 
unknown to the teacher who must find his text. 
It is fair to say that some of the first-year Latin texts 
which have had the smallest sales are really good texts and 
that some of the poorest texts have had large sales, in the 
face of the breakdown of the classes which have been 
dragged along through their pages. 
What about the publisher ?—It does not matter greatly. 
Each house presenting one or more books will set forth the 
strong features in strong terms. If pressed, they can also 
set forth the weak places of the other publisher’s books. 
Teachers may well hear all arguments, but it is not safe 
to take a book simply because the representative of a 
given house is a better advocate than his competitor. 
For instance, it is told of one representative that he secured 
the adoption of his first-year textbook by a committee 
of business men on the argument that his book actually 
had one hundred words more in its vocabulary than the 
other book under consideration! Another, by loosening a 
few threads, actually shook a competing book until it fell 
to pieces. ; 
A good test of a book’s value is the kind of schools that 
use it. However, the best schools are continually changing, 
in the hope of finding something better than they are using. 
Use quickly reveals to the trained teacher the weakness 
of any textbook. So the report that a publisher shows you 
of the large adoption and of the high schools using his 
books may be good evidence of the value of the books, or it 
may be merely evidence of a perfect business organization 
 
-P-A-G-E-66
  56 TEACHING HIGH-SCHOOL LATIN 
backing the book and placing it in every possible 
opening. 
It must be stated, however, that the publishers do not 
often force the sale of a book beyond its worth. If for a 
short time they make glowing reports, facts eventually 
force them to a more sober view of the case and the book 
gradually finds its proper place. 
Latin teaching, especially in the first year, has suffered 
severely from the mistakes of publishers who, as a business 
proposition, have pushed into the schools books which 
have not rendered good service. 
Who should select the text?—It is generally best for 
the man who is to use an instrument or machine to select 
the particular one with which he feels sure of getting results. 
So it is with the teacher and his text. Circumstances some- 
times prevent this, as when the text is selected by a state 
or city board, or by the head of a departmenit in a large 
system of schools. In this way some advantages are 
secured, as in prices and exchange rates. If possible, 
however, large deference should be shown the teacher who 
is to use the book. 
If the text selected does not suit the teacher exactly, 
it is all the more necessary for him to exert himself and 
from his own knowledge to supplement the adopted text 
_so as to secure results in spite of the challenge of an unsatis- 
factory book. His ability to do good work, in face of the 
limitation placed upon him, is a good test of his worth as 
a teacher.
-P-A-G-E-67
CHAPTER IX 
FIRST-YEAR LATIN 
Selecting the text.—The very best text available should 
be placed in the hands of those who are beginning Latin. 
This is the year in which large numbers who start Latin 
fail so utterly to do anything with it that they do not even 
see how it can be of value-to others who may succeed with 
it. Facing this serious task, young teachers may prefer 
to use the text which they themselves studied in high 
school. While this may do as a beginning, they should 
search for better texts and better methods of teaching the 
subject. et 
Whoever selects the, text, Whether teacher or school 
board, the following considerations should largely deter- 
mine the choice: 
1. Thé text should be thoroughly systematic—There 
should be a definite plan in the text, and it should be devel- 
oped consistently. A large number of the texts now avail- 
able have not impressed teachers as having any very 
strong purpose or as being logically planned out. Several 
have good single features, and are good at some points 
while unsatisfactory at others. They all represent a 
sincere effort to improve Latin teaching in the schools, 
but unfortunately many of them cannot be used with any 
degree of success. 
2. A full year’s work should be definitely planned out.-- 
The texts prepared by Collar and Daniell, some years ago, 
held to about 75 lessons, and apparently fixed for others 
which came after them the number of lessons for first-year 
57 
 
-P-A-G-E-68
  58 TEACHING HIGH-SCHOOL LATIN 
Latin texts. Just why this number was decided upon, or 
why it has been so generally followed, is difficult to ex- 
plain, and even more difficult to establish as pedagogically 
sound. 
The texts are understood to contain a year’s work, 
divided into 75 “lessons.” By most teachers, a “lesson” 
is understood to be a day’s task. Calling the divisions 
“chapters,” as a few texts do, does not change the fact that 
the “lesson” idea is conveyed to the young teacher. 
It is highly improbable that any class of pupils of 
secondary grade could, day in and day out, master these 
“lessons” as they are given. The editors do not expect 
it, as is seen in the titles, First-Year Latin, First Latin 
Book, Latin for Beginners, and so on. Now inasmuch as 
pupils confessedly cannot do the “lessons” as given, and 
the editors do not expect anything of the kind, the question 
of the wisdom and the pedagogical soundness of the plan 
is not a very difficult one to dispose of. 
An experienced teacher might be able to divide the 
material given in the ordinary first Latin text of 75 lessons 
so as to keep well in hand the year’s task, and finally 
complete his work satisfactorily. A large number are 
forced to guess their whereabouts the first year they use a 
text. If they come out well, they watch for the dates which 
they were careful to make against certain stopping-places, 
as charts for succeeding years. But an inexperienced 
teacher, seeing the word “‘lesson,” may try to force a lesson 
on his class, from the first. If not, he is entirely at sea as 
to where he is going and when he is expected to arrive. 
Scores of young teachers have told the writer that this divi- 
sion of the text into impossible lessons had been the bane 
of their lives while they were trying to teach Latin. Why
-P-A-G-E-69
    FIRST-YEAR LATIN 59 
should this strain be placed upon them, or even upon the 
experienced teacher? What is the good of it? 
As this material is given, each lesson usually has a few 
declensions, or parts of a conjugation, then a vocabulary, 
then a few rules of syntax, with explanations; after this, 
from ten to twenty-five Latin-into-English sentences, 
followed by ten to fifteen English-into-Latin sentences. 
Suppose that a teacher gives one-half of this material 
one day, and the other part the day following. The bulk 
of the work will be in the second half, unless there is expert 
division. Also, some of these lessons will be sufficient for 
two,days, some for three days, or possibly more, where the 
subject is very difficult. 
Most high schools have a session of nine months, or 
thirty-six weeks. In this time, certain days must be 
counted out for holidays. Thirty-six weeks, of five reci- 
tations a week, would require 180 lessons. If sufficient 
provision is made for reviews and written examinations, 
there is no objection to providing for the full 180 lessons, 
as the holidays could take the place of reviews now and 
then. A text of 160 lessons, well worked out, would have 
its strong appeal, inasmuch as this would leave some little 
time at the disposal of the experienced teacher and would 
still help the inexperienced one in reaching the conclusion 
of a year’s work with some peace of mind. Plain common- 
sense would advise a readjustment of first-year Latin texts 
in this particular. 
An editor, knowing these things, would do much more for 
those who use his text if he would make the divisions before- 
hand, and save the loss and confusion which must follow 
mere guesswork in dividing. He can place in one “lesson” 
just what the average high-school pupil can do in one
-P-A-G-E-70
  60 TEACHING HIGH-SCHOOL LATIN 
assignment, and distribute his material so as to cover a 
year’s actual work. 
If school officers and Latin teachers are unable to find 
such a text as is here recommended, that is, one which 
definitely provides the work for a year, with reasonable 
divisions, they should not hesitate to urge: their wishes 
upon publishers. The principle is correct, without a 
question, and if teachers call for such a book, publishers 
are always wise enough to see that reasonable demands are 
met. : 
3. There should be abundant provision for reviews and 
written tests.—Vhis does not require any discussion. 
4. There should be provision to enable the brighter students 
to do more than the minimum requirement.—In other words, 
there should be a required part and an optional part to every 
lesson. The main part of the lesson, the required part, 
should comprise just what an average boy or girl can pre- 
pare each day, with fair regard for other lessons. In addi- 
tion to this, there should be an optional part to each lesson, 
made up of interesting material from various sources, such 
as will invite pupils to a little extra, pleasurable effort. 
Here should be Latin verses, famous sayings in Latin, 
proverbs, Rible verses, riddles, songs, colloquia, short 
poems; brief descriptions and illustrations of great Roman 
monuments, the temples, arches, roads, amphitheaters; 
discussions of Roman customs, society, and daily life, and 
of the great Romans, as statesmen, generals, writers—these 
should be short and yet complete enough to open the eyes 
of the pupils to the new world which they are entering. 
These things cause no loss of time and give not only the 
bright pupils but the dull ones also something that will hold 
their interest and make sure that the required part will be
-P-A-G-E-71
  
FIRST-YEAR LATIN 6r 
ready at the right time. Good experience is back of this 
statement. A little extra “dessert,” if you please, comes 
in well after the rougher course. This optional part, 
properly handled, can be made to take off the burden and 
make even the hard drudgery seem less trying. 
5. The text should be interesting.—Most of the texts are 
dull and heavy from the first to the last page. Many start 
with Caesar, stay with Caesar, and end with Caesar. 
Pupils are ““Caesared” day in and out, for a whole year. 
Not a bright or amusing thing appears from cover to cover. 
In order to learn Latin, pupils simply must study; but 
they will work joyfully and gladly over something that is 
of. human interest, whereas they grow weary of persistent 
drudgery. They are, in other words, much like grown 
folks. The teacher must see that the forms and simple 
constructions are learned thoroughly. He can do this more 
easily if he now and then works ina riddle, or a proverb, 
or a song, or the story of a student prank, as a feature 
of his class work. It will help to carry the onus of the hard 
labor and to brighten the day for him. The text should 
provide material of this kind, either with each lesson, or 
as part of an appendix. 
6. The vocabulary should contain as many English 
source words as possible.--It is usual! to insist that the words 
be from Caesar. If he used them a few hundred times, they 
are counted royal. A fair part of the vocabulary may well 
come from Caesar, but there are other factors which deserve 
consideration. 
It is possible to select a vocabulary from Caesar that 
will contain English source words; but a glance at the usua! 
first-year vocabulary shows that it is not done. This is a 
weakness. Latin words which show kinship to English
-P-A-G-E-72
  62 TEACHING HIGH-SCHOOL LATIN 
words are easily remembered and are not a burden on the 
memory, even though there has been a shift in meaning. 
When such words are used, the size of the vocabulary is 
of small moment. If the pupil sees porto, scribo, laudo, 
hora, indignitas, iniuria, labor, legio, and the like, he catches 
instantly the relationship between them and the English 
words he knows, and the impression abides. Any little shifts 
in meaning may be adjusted at leisure. Pupils take very 
kindly to a vocabulary that is in ordinary touch with what 
they already know. Latin can be learned quite as well 
with these words as with any other list. 
The number of words is not important. The outcry 
about limiting the vocabulary to 500, or 600, or 700 words 
is quite unnecessary. If the words show kinship to common 
English words, a vocabulary of 2,000 words is no more 
burdensome to a pupil than one of 400 studiously selected 
from Caesar’s Commentaries. A combination of about 500 
simple words from Caesar and 500 of apparent kinship 
to English derivatives would make a vocabulary that 
ought to satisfy everybody, unless indeed some teacher has 
little enough of wisdom to try to have the entire vocabulary 
committed to memory. The general vocabulary is for 
reference purposes, and may well contain quite a number of 
words which are not given in the smaller vocabularies 
intended as parts of recitations. 
7. There should be suggestions for teachers, footnotes, etc.— 
Many Latin teachers have had no experience, and the 
editor should have had the training and experience which 
enable him to make suggestions that will strengthen the 
teacher’s hands and help in presenting the material effect- 
ively. Such suggestions add largely to the value of the 
text, not only for the inexperienced teacher, but even for
-P-A-G-E-73
FIRST-YEAR LATIN 63 
those of long experience; who may now and then get an 
idea that will help them. 
A general suggestion.—In the first place, it is necessary 
to call attention to the fact that in your beginning Latin 
classes you are giving many students their first taste of real, 
hard study. It will require much patience and common- 
sense to keep them really interested and disposed to stick 
to their task. When they complain, some students who 
are taking other subjects which require little application 
or study will give glowing reports of their easy times and 
thus unsettle the minds of your young Romans. Stay 
close to them individually and try to set right any who 
are being disquieted by the sight of others disporting 
themselves under less irksome conditions. You have the 
hard task of teaching a dozen things in one class. Few of 
your beginning students know anything whatever about 
English grammar. Many do not know a subject from a 
' predicate. Teachers of English are very busy nowadays 
with the beavties of literature-—and you must with patience 
do a part of their work in your Latin class. Some students 
will know nothing about concentration, nothing about 
doing a neat, careful, painstaking picce of work of any 
kind, and you must teach them these things. Hold them 
to every form with the utmost exactness. Explain to 
them meantime just wherein they are weak and let them 
know that much of their difficulty is due to the-fact that 
they must learn a number of other things along with their 
Latin. Tell them of the benefits which have come to the 
countless thousands who have learned Latin, and do not 
hesitate to let them feel that the boy who chooses Latin 
and makes good in it is a superior student in your estimation 
and one whom lazier and duller boys might profitably
-P-A-G-E-74
  64 TEACHING HIGH-SCHOOL LATIN 
emulate. There is no good reason for being timid on this 
matter, for the facts are with you. If parents become 
somewhat unfavorably disposed toward your subject, go 
to them and talk over the question with them. Do not 
let a boy’s education become queered, or be wrecked, if ag 
is in your power to prevent it. 
Organizing the class.—Get your class organized the 
very first day of school, if possible. Because of the troubles 
which former Latin pupils have had, and the too common 
noise made against Latin study by irresponsibles, you will 
find some of your pupils in fear and trembling as they 
face what they regard as a hopeless task. Be prepared to 
reassure them. Let them understand that your require- 
ments are not unreasonable, and that good faithful work 
will succeed. i. 
Just as soon as books are secured, and before making 
any assignment for the next day, have all pupils open their 
books, talk with them about the editors and publishers, — 
show and explain some few of the illustrations, and promise 
to tell them more about Roman life and customs during the 
year. Go over the introductory chapter with them. 
Explain what the Latin language is and why we study 
it today. 
Then have the class turn to the first lesson. Let the 
first assignment be simple and short, and go over the main 
parts with the pupils. Explain what you want done and 
how. If your text has a little verse or a few metrical lines, 
read them over and over and have the members of the class 
repeat, line by line, until they can read them without your 
help. If your book has no such passage, use one of 
these:
-P-A-G-E-75
  
FIRST-YEAR LATIN “S65 
Florus to Hadrian: Ego nélo Caésar ésse, 
Ambulare per Britannos, 
Scythicas pati pruinas. 
Hadrian to Florus: Ego ndlo Flérus ésse, 
Ambulare per tabernas, 
Latitare per tabernas. 
The blockhead pupil.—You will be fortunate if you 
do not find some pupils in your class who simply cannot 
learn Latin, or anything else. Go slow in deciding this 
question, but after you make sure that a pupil is too dull for 
your work, or for other sufficient reason unable to grasp 
the subject, state the case to your principal and secure for 
the pupil a transfer to work which he can do. Many 
high schools are now offering work in manual training and 
similar subjects which requires mainly manual dexterity, 
and pupils who are unable to do Latin may possibly do that 
work. <A pupil might succeed in concrete work who simply 
can do nothing with the more abstract foreign-language 
work. Such pupils should not load up a class to the hurt 
of those who can and will do satisfactory work. 
For succeeding days.—The first few minutes in a 
classroom largely determine the temper of both teacher and 
pupils for the hour. One of the best ways for getting both 
into condition for good hard work is to have the teacher 
now and then assign a stanza of some poem, and to have 
the pupils recite the poem, as far as learned, just as the 
class is being seated. Pupils like this, and if the amount 
given is not too much, and the demand is not too exacting, 
it will serve a good purpose. After they learn “Ego nolo 
Caesar esse,’sgive “Mica, mica, parva stella,” and so on. 
Then let them learn a Latin hymn, or a song, to be used in a 
similar way. The first-year class might learn one song as  
-P-A-G-E-76
  
66 TEACHING HIGH-SCHOOL LATIN 
its own; the second year, another, and so on. This will 
cost little effort, and will save you many a trying hour. 
Be reasonable.—Do not try to do too much. Make 
assignments as fair as possible, if your book does not 
provide for each day of the year. Even if it does, and gives 
too much, leave out some things that you think can be 
omitted without harm. It is better to break up the book 
than to discourage the pupils. If a pupil does not do all he 
should, do not be too severe—a tendency too commonly 
attributed to Latin teachers. The world will not come 
to an end even if little Johnny knows only half of his 
lesson. 
Work fast.—This injunction holds for the other years 
as well. If you do all that is planned out for you in this 
book, you will have to move with good speed. A Latin 
teacher has no business dawdling, anyway. Hold the atten- 
tion of your class very closely, and from start to finish 
keep things going at high speed. When the required work 
is done, then you may have time to relax somewhat and 
to take up something extra with your class. 
Drills, drills, drills —After your class is seated, and 
before you begin the day’s assignment, take a minute or two 
for review drills on the forms, when you have reached the 
declensions. For instance, the entire class should recite 
in concert one or two nouns of the first declension: as, 
tuba, tubae, tubae, etc., the teacher indicating the word to 
be declined. The verbs are treated in the same way, the 
teacher indicating the mood, tense, voice, etc. In this 
way you can drill the forms into the minds of the pupils 
so that they will never forget them. Keep this up indefi- 
nitely, leaving off gradually those that have been mastered, 
only to call them up now and then. Pupils appreciate the 
 
-P-A-G-E-77
  
FIRST-YEAR LATIN 67 
value of these review drills and enter into them heartily. 
Now and then it is well to call on a particular pupil, but in 
the main have all recite in concert. Even the slowest will 
will get the lessons after awhile. 
Assigning the next. lesson.—Always use the last few 
minutes of the period in going over the next day’s assign- 
ment and making plain just what is to be done. If there 
are new words, pronounce them and have the class repeat 
them after you. If the sentences seem involved or difficult, 
translate one or two and give the class a start. 
The Latin-English exercise.—Usually each lesson has 
a Latin exercise for translation into English. As directed 
above, always go over this exercise the day before you 
expect the recitation. If any of the sentences are unusually 
difficult, try to clear up any part that may seem puzzling. 
At recitation, call on some pupils to read the Latin sentence, 
then let all the pupils read it together. Do not accept a 
slow pronouncing of the words, but require a rapid reading 
——this certainly after the class has worked a month or so. 
The same pupil who first read, or some other, may now be 
called on to translate. If his translation is correct, have all 
the members translate together. If the first recitation 
is not quite accurate, the teacher should give an accurate 
translation, after which all the pupils might translate in 
concert. Never let a pupil translate word for word, as, 
“Caesar, Caesar, dixit, said,” but require a straightforward 
rendering into good English. If an exercise is found dif- 
ficult, call it up again the next day for a rapid re-reading. 
This plan may be varied now and then by reading the 
sentences slowly and accurately to the class, and by having 
pupils give the translation without looking at the book. 
This training by hearing is decidedly valuable.
-P-A-G-E-78
  68 TEACHING HIGH-SCHOOL LATIN 
The English-Latin exercise.—There are several ways 
in which good results may be secured: 
1. Students may be: required to study and write out these 
sentences before coming to class.—In class, the student should 
read each sentence carefully and give the exact Latin, 
without referring to his written paper, of course. After 
the exercise has been done in this way, all the pupils should 
go to the blackboard and copy on the board the exercise as 
they prepared it, leaving sufficient space between the lines 
for corrections. Exchanges can be secured by moving all 
students one exercise to the right or left, care being taken 
that permanent places are so assigned that weak students 
and strong students may alternate in order, for obvious 
reasons. The teacher should then go over the exercise, 
sentence by sentence, giving the correct Latin, and dis- 
cussing fully every question of form or syntax which may 
arise. Each student should make the necessary correc- 
tions in the work which falls to his charge. Time should 
be taken for any who are not convinced of the correctness 
of the statements of the teacher, and the text should 
settle any appeals to authority. Have some Latin gram- 
mars at hand, in case fuller evidence is necessary. Where 
blackboard facilities are insufficient, a part of the class can 
be sent to the board each day. Another plan of grading is 
to seat the class in two, or any other even number of rows, 
and to let the two rows of seats exchange papers for cor- 
rection. The teacher can give the correct sentence and 
the students can correct the mistakes found, if there are 
any. For this plan, it is necessary that students write 
on alternate lines, in order to avoid confusion. After 
papers are returned, protests should be invited, and any 
questions raised should have attention.
-P-A-G-E-79

if : 
2. Most of the texts give exercises based mainly on the 
rules of syntax found in the current lesson.—It would be 
much better if the exercise were always based on con- 
structions which have been thoroughly explained in class 
in the lesson of the previous day. In spite of all admoni- 
tions, pupils will persist in doing their written work before 
they prepare the rules and. vocabulary for the day. 
Therefore the second plan suggested is that you assign 
the English-Latin exercise for the day for sight translation 
only. Go over each sentence carefully, and let it be under- 
stood that you do not hold the class responsible for previous 
preparation. Do not use this work in determining your 
grades. Then, after every point has been cleared up, 
assign the exercise for writing as part of the next recitation. 
For instance: The lesson is on the ablative absolute. Let 
the class prepare the Latin-English sentences as usual, 
but tell them not to try the English-Latin part. In class, 
after the principle of the absolute construction has been 
fully explained and the first part of the day’s task has been 
done, have the pupils go over the English-Latin sentences 
at sight, calling on individuals as usual. After the sentence 
has been given correctly, have all repeat it in concert. 
Direct them to bring in this exercise properly written out 
the next day. 
When the exercise is ready next day, you may proceed 
according to the first plan above described. Begin with 
an oral report on each sentence, if time permits; otherwise 
send pupils to the blackboard and have them copy off their 
report, as suggested above. With all this effort, your 
pupils ought to get the lesson well in mind. 
If papers show a decided weakness, return them for. 
rewriting.
-P-A-G-E-80
  y fe) TEACHING HIGH-SCHOOL LATIN 
Very much written work in the first year has often 
proved a nuisance rather than a help. If your text has 
more than four short sentences, do not assign more than 
four to be reported in writing. After the first half-year, 
you will get good results by omitting all written work. 
In this case, you had best have the class report orally on 
the part which you did at sight the previous day. 
Watch your weaker pupils. They need this extra 
interest and will repay it. The stronger ones can help 
themselves. Invite those who need help to come to you 
at your open periods and help them get hold of the topics 
on which they are failing. A little encouragement and 
help judiciously given will work wonders. By this kind 
of effort you will do much more than by constant checking 
and pulling at pupils who may be doing their level best. 
7Y Pronunciation.—Most of the texts use the Roman 
method of pronunciation. . In using it, do not make a great 
bugbear of pronunciation. Unless you mention it, pupils 
will probably not know that teachers ever used English 
sounds in pronouncing Latin. Opposition to Roman 
method has practically ceased, and what there is, is aca- 
demic strictly. It would be merely amusing to pronounce 
German and French with English sounds, and arguments 
for doing so would be of equal value with those in favor of 
pronouncing Latin as we do English. Scholars are agreed 
that the Roman method closely approximates the speech 
of the Romans, and pupils will be willing to make the little 
extra effort to catch the few uncommon sounds. This is 
a good exercise in itself, and this knowledge will serve the 
pupils well when they take up a modern language. 
However, do not be too rigid in this matter. Be sure 
that you pronounce correctly yourself, and the pupils will 
   
-P-A-G-E-81
  FIRST-YEAR LATIN Te 
catch your usage quite as well as they will if you say much 
about it. By this indirection you will accomplish your pur- 
posein time. Reciting in concert, paradigms, verses, songs, 
and the like will work out your problems in pronunciation. 
Accent.—A satisfactory text should not present the 
tasks too rapidly. The reasons for accent might well be 
held back for some weeks, but the early lessons should show 
every new word properly accented. Later, when the rules 
for accent are given, you have the basis already laid for 
fixing the rules definitely in the pupils’ minds. As sug- 
gested in the matter of pronunciation, accent your own 
words correctly and be patient with the.class. Things will 
come out all right in good time. 
Quantity.—The value of vowels must be explained, and, 
since nearly all the texts have the long vowels marked, 
it is easy to present this topic. The bearing of the vowels 
on pronunciation and accent is easily understood. 
The question of requiring all the long vowels to be 
marked in all written exercises is one that requires attention. 
For some years a majority of the best schools in this country 
have greatly stressed the marking of long vowels, requiring 
this to be done in all written paradigms, exercises, etc. 
This has not proved to be a paying task, its value falling 
decidedly short of the outlay in time, effort, and nervous 
strain. If the choice is between so much of it and none 
at all, take the latter. Latin teaching has become so 
cluttered up with extra work that has little to do with 
learning the language that it is necessary to. choose some 
vital parts and let the rest go. Pupils do not need a knowl- 
edge of quantities until they reach Vergil; certainly it is 
not a serious need, and when they do need this information 
they can get it in a very short time.
-P-A-G-E-82
72 TEACHING HIGH-SCHOOL LATIN 
However, it is suggested as a result of successful experi- 
ence that it is well to require the class to mark the long 
vowels in written exercises for the first two or three months. 
Then the marking may be omitted altogether, as pupils 
will have found out by this time the service which the vowel 
marks render. : 
How much should-a class do in a year?—If you have 
a text of the Collar type, say of 75 lessons with a little extra 
reading, your best course will be to finish the text as far 
as the reading appendix by the end of the seventh month, 
or thereabouts. The reading-matter in most of these 
books is poorly graded, much of it being too difficult for 
your purpose. You are advised to use for the last two 
months or so some easy reading like the Gradatim, Via 
Latina, or Ora Maritima, taking care to assign only easy 
selections. Together with the reading from these books, 
assign a review lesson in forms from the usual text. 
The spare moments.—Try to systematize your work 
and to push it along fast enough to have a few moments 
left, after each day’s work is done, for relaxation before 
dismissing the class. Try not to send the pupils out in the 
very midst of the strain. A good Latin text should supply 
you with optional material for use at this time, some Latin 
proverbs, songs, a photogravure with its explanation, or 
something of the kind. If it has nothing, try to provide 
it from other sources—something from mythology, Roman 
history, a state seal, etc. Get your class to read Bulwer- 
Lytton’s Last Days of Pompeii, and then discuss it in class, 
chapter by chapter. If not all can read it, get some one 
or two to do so and to tell the class a little of the story 
each day. While there are limits beyond which a class 
cannot go, nevertheless it is best to bring some of. this
-P-A-G-E-83
  FIRST-YEAR: LATIN 73 
| interesting material down to pupils even of this grade. 
It adds to their interest and helps them to bear up under the 
burden and drudgery of forms and constructions. Do not 
overstress this feature, but give it some time. This subject 
is treated more fully elsewhere. 
Your main task.—You are expected to teach your class 
the forms and simpler constructions during this year. 
If you fail in this, your work is defective. Make your 
hours and classroom pleasant and attractive, plan out some 
relaxation, but use this as a means to an end—-good hard, 
honest work by the class. Let it be understood that the 
task must be done, that the forms and constructions must 
be learned above all else. Keep this to the front and 
results will come. 
Who should be promoted?—After you have done your 
best to do the work expected of you, you may at the year’s 
close find some who simply cannot go on to the next year’s 
work. You will have to decide promotions on the merits 
of individual cases, of course. If a pupil knows the forms 
and constructions well, even though he may be weak in 
his translations, it is generally safe to move him up. Some 
will prefer to go over the book again. It is not wise to 
hold a pupil to the first-year text until he is thoroughly 
tired and sick of it. Sometimes a trial of second-year 
work will convince him of his weakness and send him back 
to more earnest effort in first-year work. On the whole, 
the question of promotion is simply that of whether the boy 
or girl can do the next year’s work. This depends on the 
second year’s task. If you go directly to Caesar, the num- 
ber promoted must be carefully guarded. If you use the 
more sensible, easy Latin for awhile, you can promote with 
less hesitation those who are fairly well able to do the work. 
 
-P-A-G-E-84
CHAPTER X 
SECOND-YEAR LATIN 
Selecting the text.—In selecting the text for this year, 
the first question to decide is whether the class shall go 
directly to Caesar or spend some time on simpler Latin 
and then go to Caesar. Some good schools take up Caesar 
immediately, as they seem able to prepare for Caesar in 
one year. An increasingly large number of schools are 
inclining toward giving the first part of this year to reading 
simple Latin as a preparation for Caesar during the 
remainder of the year. 
1. If the class is ready for Caesar, a whole year can be 
spent on his Gallic Wars with profit, as there is nothing 
better for training pupils in the forms and simpler con- 
structions. The narrative may also be made interesting 
by a good teacher, although some pupils may not enjoy 
so much of battle and strife. 
‘The teacher or committee selecting the text should 
require good mechanical work, clean, clear type, and liberal 
illustration. Beyond this, Caesar texts are generally 
much alike, especially in notes and vocabulary--sometimes 
amazingly alike. The arrangement of the material may 
be better in some than in others, as some editions have the 
notes and current vocabulary on the same page with the 
text. Some few editions give the text, notes, vocabulary, 
grammar and prose composition all in one volume. This is 
by no means a bad plan, and is likely to become general, 
as it should. There are weak places in the editions of this 
14 
 
-P-A-G-E-85
  
SECOND-YEAR LATIN 75 
kind now available, but they will no doubt be improved 
in later editions. 
It is unfortunate that several of the most scholarly 
editions available are so very large and contain so very 
much material that their very size arouses prejudice. 
This apparent padding is valuable for reference purposes 
in schools which have no library facilities. Large volumes 
will necessarily go out of use as others serving the same 
purpose but of convenient size become available. 
A popular text in the schools of England contains only 
one book of Caesar per volume. It is of convenient size, 
and the four books required for the year’s work do not cost 
any more than the one volume commonly used in this coun- 
try. Itis hoped that we shall have a similar series available 
before very long. 
The book selected should also give the story of the 
books which your class cannot read. Too many pupils 
spend a year on Caesar, doing the required work faithfully, 
but do not know the full story of the campaigns in Gaul. 
If the entire story of the eight books is given, this plan 
will prove very acceptable. 
It is not at all necessary that all the pupils use the 
same text, unless you are using one of the editions which 
contain the text, notes, grammar, etc., in one volume. 
You can get good results by allowing pupils to use any 
text they may have while preparing the lesson, provided 
you have a sufficient number of some one text edition 
for class use. Different books will naturally take differ- 
ent views of constructions now and then. Let the pupils 
defend their authors. A boy will fight to the last ditch 
for a book which he has been doing his best to lose or give 
away. 
 
-P-A-G-E-86
  
76 TEACHING HIGH-SCHOOL LATIN 
2. Classes are not often ready for Caesar at the opening 
of the second year. Few of the usual books prepare for 
Caesar, and it is doubtful if the average pupil can get 
ready for Caesar in one school year of nine months, with- 
out neglecting some of his other studies. Caesar is more 
difficult Latin than its place in the course of study would 
indicate. It is quite as difficult as the German and French 
used in the fourth year of the high school, in every par- 
ticular—syntax, vocabulary,.etc. It really ought to be 
given in the third year, for it is the rock on which unnum- 
bered thousands of faithful pupils have gone to pieces 
utterly. 
For nine out of every ten classes, it is best to begin with 
some simple Latin and review the forms and simple con- 
structions of the first year. This can be done by using the 
Gradatim, Fabulae Faciles, Via Latina, etc., or one of the 
second-year volumes specially prepared to take the place 
of a full year of Caesar. They generally give about the 
second half of the year to Caesar. | 
Selections from modern Latin, as si iggested above, or 
from Eutropius, Nepos, and others, can be adapted to this 
purpose. Probably the best material available is in Late 
Latin, which is particularly rich in human interest. The 
book should follow the plans suggested for the first year, 
that is, should give attention to optional material along 
with the required, to verses, notes on Roman life, society, 
government, and the like, and should simply continue the 
interest there aroused. If the book contains the necessary 
grammar, notes, and prose composition, it will be all the 
better. 
Circumstances will have to determine your course. 
If you work under a course of study which absolutely 
 
-P-A-G-E-87
SECOND-YEAR LATIN 7° 
fixes the work in Caesar, you will of course be forced to do 
the best you can. Let the assignment of the first month 
or so be very short, and give all the help and encourage- 
ment necessary. Where you can control the situation, 
you will find strong reasons in favor of using the substitute 
Latin, especially in the public high schools. 
The average second-year pupil does not learn much 
about the civilization of Rome from his Caesar. Also, 
many high schools give only two years of Latin, and quite 
a number of colleges and universities require two years 
of Latin for admission to certain courses, but require no 
further work in Latin. In such cases; unless they touch 
some other Latin than Caesar, Fe cem may leave the 
subject with a feeling that Latin is of veryimited value. 
The selections if properly made should bring such pupils 
into touch with the real life and literature of the Romans. 
Organizing the class.—The first day should be spent 
much as was directed in connection with the work for the 
first year. If the text is Caesar, talk about him and his 
great achievements, and his service to the world. If a 
book of selections is used, talk about the writers from whom 
selections are taken, and explain that the Gradatim, 
Fabulae Faciles, and similar Latin, are by modern writers 
of Latin who prepared these stories for the use of boys 
and girls in school. 
For the second day the class should study the introduc- 
tory pages, if all have the same book; if not, simply ask 
all to study the life of Caesar, in their books or in the refer- 
ence books. If the class is using the Gradatim go at once 
to a regular lesson. 
Assigning the lesson.—For the first month the teacher 
every day should look over the next day’s task with the  
-P-A-G-E-88
a ee a pe Ce 
78 TEACHING HIGH-SCHOOL LATIN 
class. Any unusually difficult words or constructions 
should be explained beforehand. If the class is very 
weak, translate a few sentences of the next day’s assign- 
ment, for a month or so, but discontinue this practice. as 
soon as possible. If the pupils have a very hard time, 
you will have to stand by them and help them until 
they can go alone. Perhaps they are not responsible 
for being unprepared. Do not overwork nor discourage 
them. 
Where to begin in Caesar.—The beginning should not 
be made with the first book. This is about as difficult 
Latin as is found in the high-school course. It is better 
to begin with the second or third book. If you do this, 
give the story of the books which you pass over temporarily, 
so that the class will have the connection. After you 
read the fourth book, you can go back and read the book 
or books which you passed over. It may be objected that 
this plan breaks into the narrative too seriously, but the 
narrative can stand the injury better than your class will 
if you overburden the pupils with difficult constructions 
at the very first. 
The daily assignment.—This depends on the class. 
The teacher must use his good sense and try to get a fair 
amount of reading done, without injustice to the pupils 
or to other subjects which they are carrying. 
High-school pupils are expected to read four books 
of Caesar during this year and that is not too much if the 
class is well prepared. But if it is impossible to do so 
much, it is infinitely better to read three books carefully 
and intelligently than to skim over four, five, or six. Study 
your class and have it do just what it can do well and no 
more.
-P-A-G-E-89
SECOND-YEAR LATIN 79 
Sometimes strong classes will complete the four books 
a month or six weeks before the close of the year, although 
this seldom happens. Such classes will enjoy some light 
reading, as the parts of Fabulae Faciles and similar Latin 
with which they are not familiar. 
A good plan is to give short lessons for the first two 
quarters or two-thirds of the school year, to get the forms 
and sentences carefully, then to read rapidly, mainly at 
sight, the part of the four books not already covered. 
Chapters read thus at sight should be re-read next day. 
The class at recitation.— 
1. As the class assembles, it is not a bad plan to have 
some Latin song or hymn or memory verse with which 
to take up the first minute or so. If the pupils are weak 
in forms, they might repeat together the declension of 
some noun or the conjugation of some verb. 
2. Questions on the previous day’s work should be 
called for. Pupils sometimes find difficulties after leaving 
class, on which they need help. 
3. Read the review lesson, that is, the lesson of the 
previous day. If the pupil called on hesitates, pass on to 
someone else, as this last reading ought to be done 
accurately and freely. 
4. Read the day’s lesson. Call on some one or two to 
read the lesson through rapidly—read, not pronounce. 
Ask for criticisms. After all questions are cleared up, 
you might read and then have all the members of the class 
read together. For a week or so you should lead the read- 
ing, but gradually leave this altogether to the class. You 
will be surprised to see how readily all the pupils will 
learn to read through without a single mistake in pro- 
nunciation.
-P-A-G-E-90
80 TEACHING HIGH-SCHOOL LATIN 
5. Call on the members of the class, one by one, after 
some system, for the translation. If the passage assigned 
to one pupil is long, direct a second pupil to be ready to 
relieve the reader at a certain point. Have the new reader 
go back and bring up what the former reader went over and 
complete the passage. Constant repetition of a translation 
will do no harm. 
After the lesson has been read in this way, allowing 
objections, criticisms, and questions after each reader 
finishes, have one or two pupils read the entire lesson 
through rapidly. It is then your turn to read it through, 
giving the clearest English you know. Following this, 
have all the members of the class give the translation in 
concert. By this time all ought to know it thoroughly. 
6. A. few minutes should now be given to forms and 
constructions. (@) Go over the lesson line by line, looking 
for forms which may not be understood by all. Call for 
the declension of a word, the principal parts of a verb, or a 
tense, now and then, generally using the whole class. 
(6) Constructions should be handled carefully and syste- 
matically. For pupils of this grade, it is best to begin with 
simple and .very definite assignments. For instance, 
assign only the nominatives for the first week; then the 
accusatives for two or three weeks; the datives for the next 
two weeks; then the ablatives for two or three months. 
This is easily done. Ask the pupils to find the ablatives 
in the next day’s lesson, for instance, with the reason for 
each one. Suppose a case: p. 24, l. 12, legibus usi sunt. 
Legibus is ablative with utor; Grammar, § 264. Then 
have the class turn to the reference and read it together. 
Only the forms and the cases should be taken up for 
the first five or six months. Then, if this part is well
-P-A-G-E-91
  Ss ee 
SECOND-YEAR LATIN 81 
understood, you can assign the subjunctives.. Before 
this you will necessarily do something with subjunctives 
in class, but do not assign them until the cases are well in 
hand. The subjunctives are difficult, and it may be better 
to work out this part in class without assignments. Go into 
these constructions ore by one~—-and have the references 
read and explained fully. By the end of ‘the year—the 
simpler subjunctives will be understood. This work can 
be completed during the third year. 
Do not expect too much syntax work out of anes A 
few minutes of fast work will be worth more to all concerned 
if done under your direction. The danger of copying 
syntax reports is obviated in this way. 
Old-fashioned parsing.-In making sure that your 
classes are thoroughly familiar with the forms and simpler 
constructions, you cannot do better than to assign old- 
fashioned parsing as a part of the day’s task for a month 
or so, preferably during the latter part of the year. If you 
have nothing better, the following scheme will answer: 
a) For nouns: Give 
1. The declension to which it belongs 
2. The declension of the noun through all the cases 
3. Gender and number 
4. The case of the noun, and the rule or reason for its use in that 
case : 
6) For pronouns and adjectives: Same as for nouns 
c) For verbs: Give 
1. The conjugation to which it belongs 
. The principal parts 
. The voice 
. The person and number 
. The tense, and the entire conjugation of the verb in that. tense 
. The mood, and the rule or reason for using that mood Au 
pwn
-P-A-G-E-92
  82 TEACHING HIGH-SCHOOL LATIN 
It will not do to press this exercise too far, as usually a 
month or so will secure the end sought. Remember to 
put this plan into operation now and then during the third 
and fourth years, if you see a need for it. 
The geography of Gaul.—While working in Caesar 
try to have a map of Gaul in constant use. See that the 
new states and towns are located. If your school has no 
chart, get a large sheet of manila paper and make one. 
Have the pupils refer constantly to the charts in their books. 
Now and then have them draw from memory a chart of 
Gaul, showing some of the prominent peoples and places. 
The narrative.-Keep the narrative before the class. 
Now and then have one of the pupils go back and bring 
up the story. The various lives of Caesar and the Roman 
histories will furnish summaries, if there is need for them. 
From your own reading, keep the class posted as to events 
in Rome meantime. Encourage questions by pupils. 
Keep a classical dictionary at hand and refer to it when 
you are not able to answer questions correctly otherwise. 
A written translation-Many pupils, especially pro- 
spective teachers, will write out their day’s translation and 
keep it for future use. This should be encouraged. The 
benefits are obvious. Sometimes it is wise to accept a 
completed piece of work of this kind in place of part of the 
term examination. The objection that others might use 
this translation is of no force, for anybody with fifty cents, 
or less, can get a translation if he wants it. 
Illustrative materials made by pupils——When you 
begin Caesar, call attention to the various implements of 
war used by the Romans and Gauls, and invite pupils to 
make models of some of these for the department. The 
response will be immediate. Get one to make a hasta,
-P-A-G-E-93
  
SECOND-YEAR LATIN 83 
full size, another a pilum, then a gladius, and so on. A 
little paint or wood stain will give the color needed. The 
vinea, scorpio, aries, and Caesar’s bridge will appeal to boys. 
Girls can make a vewillum, or dress a doll like a legatus, or a 
miles, an imperator, etc. The illustrations in the texts 
usually will guide such efforts. 
If business moves slowly, offer to accept a good piece 
of work of this kind in place of all or part of the term’s 
examination, and a scene of unrivaled activity will delight 
you. It is really worth more to a boy to get into direct 
touch with the Roman army by making models of some of 
the weapons used by the soldiery than it is to go through 
an examination. Have the names of the makers attached 
to the articles and preserve these as a nucleus for a depart- 
ment equipment.

given above. At the close of each campaign, get the class 
to read the summary given by Froude, for instance. It 
will do good to have parts read by a member of the class 
now and then, in the hearing of the whole number. If time 
permits, get each pupil to read one of the books, and more 
if possible. Sometimes this can be arranged for as collat- 
eral reading by co-operation with the English department.

or even earlier. By co-operating with the English and 
 
-P-A-G-E-95
  SECOND-YEAR LATIN 85 
history departments you may secure the reading of books | 
which will be in line with the work on these papers. The 
English department might accept the theme as one of the 
required compositions. 
Now and then you may find pupils who will take 
opposite sides and arouse very vigorous interest, as in the 
discussion of Caesar as a tyrant, of his fight with Pompey, 
or of his patriotism. The class will become intensely 
’ partisan, especially if you have Froude, Mommsen, and 
Middleton’s Cicero in reach. 
Have the papers read in class at the closing meetings 
of the year. The very best should be read by the pupil 
at the public exercises of the school, and printed in the 
school paper or some other local periodical. __ 
Prose composition.—This question is fully discussed 
elsewhere. It is generally expécted now that a fair amount 
of Latin writing shall be done during this year, and the 
colleges expect the material to be drawn from the authors. 
read. The usual plan is to give one of the five weekly 
recitations wholly to prose writing. 
You will find the plan outlined for the English-Latin 
exercise, in the work of the first year, as good as any, with | 
modifications. That is, go over the lesson as a sight- 
reading task and have it brought in written at the next 
meeting. After the class meets and before papers are 
opened, have the books opened and the sentences given in 
Latin orally. Require all the pupils to give each sentence 
in concert, after it has been given correctly by a single 
pupil. Then, if blackboard space permits, send all or 
part of the pupils to the board and have them proceed as. 
directed in the first-year plan. You may find it necessary 
to collect the papers and go over them carefully yourself,  
-P-A-G-E-96
  86 TEACHING HIGH-SCHOOL LATIN 
. but the labor required in this is so great that it cannot be 
advised or urged, except in cases where common-sense 
judges it necessary. 
As to marking the vowels, use your own judgment. 
The writer’s opinion was given under “Quantity.” If 
you require long vowels marked, give very, very short 
lessons. 
If you are free to try another plan, in place of giving 
one day a week to prose writing, follow that given under 
the general discussion. Good experience has proved the 
value of the plan by which at the close of the day’s transla- 
tion two or three sentences are given out by the teacher, 
preferably only two. Put these on the board, or use the 
sentences in the text. Go over them at sight and call for 
these written out as part of the next day’s work. Take 
these up, or, better, grade them as suggested before, 
allowing pupils to exchange. Send some or all of the pupils 
to the board. This will take only five minutes each day, 
and will save you a full recitation each week for reading 
purposes. 
This plan is better than the full-day arrangement. 
Pupils watch for similar constructions and expressions in 
their reading. Ask pupils to offer sentences for the next 
day, based on the lesson, if you prefer. You can modify 
those offered so that they will do. Stick fast to two sen- 
tences, and short ones at that. A really workable text 
could give one or two sentences after each chapter. 
Break away from the reading now and then and give 
other sentences, as a relief-from the monotony. Use a 
newspaper paragraph, or a story now and then, as a source 
for the sentences. :

  CHAPTER XI 
THIRD-YEAR LATIN 
The text.—What was said under ‘‘Second-Year Latin” 
about selecting the text, organizing the class, assigning 
the lesson, and the general plan of procedure holds equally 
well for this year. 
The year’s work.—This class is generally expected to 
read six or seven orations of Cicero, including those against 
Catiline, for Archias, and that on Manilian law. You may 
find it well worth while to use the Fourteenth Philippic 
in place of the Manilian law oration, for these reasons: 
(x) It opens up a most interesting period of Roman history, 
as compared:with the rather tame laudation of Pompey. 
Caesar and Pompey have recently fallen, Cicero is making 
his last stand, and Augustus and Antony are taking over 
the rule of the world. (2) It is the last of his orations we 
have and one of his greatest. As the Verres orations repre- 
sent his youthful oratory, the Catiline and Archias his 
mature manhood, so the Philippics represent the last 
great effort of his life, equaling the best, if it is not itself 
the very best of his oratory. (3) The Manilian law oration 
is long and tedious, and pupils do not find it as interesting 
as the Philippics. 
Some teachers prefer to read Cicero for two terms, if the 
year has three, and to read the Metamorphoses of Ovid 
for the last term. Both plans are good and one is no better 
than the other. A term of Ovid is a good preparation for 
Vergil, but this does not more than balance the good 
87 
   
-P-A-G-E-98
88 TEACHING HIGH-SCHOOL LATIN 
results which come from a close study of the Archias oration 
and the Fourteenth Philippic. 
Syntax and thought.—By this time your pupils ought 
to know their forms well. If not, put them to work on a 
review of forms. In syntax, following the plan of the 
second year, it will be well to give a week or two to the cases, 
after which you may deal mainly with the moods and tenses. 
If your class gives evidence of understanding the moods 
and tenses by the first of the new year, or by March, it 
will be well to work less on syntax and stress more and more 
the oratorical and logical features of the orations. Keep 
the arguments well in hand and frequently ask someone 
to summarize these up to date. 
Do not allow your class to take too seriously what 
Cicero says against those whom he is opposing. Explain 
that Cicero is a public orator, much like our attorneys for 
the state who make out just as bad a case as possible against 
the one prosecuted. If they were employed to defend him, 
they would likewise make him out a great and good man. 
The Roman audiences, like our juries, knew how to take 
all these charges and sift them for the truth. Politicians 
in Rome could see no good in their opponents and they 
said ‘so, much as our stump speakers do today. Cicero’s 
methods of speaking were those generally used by Roman 
orators of his time. 
A study of the oration for its thought ought to arouse 
in your class some appreciation of Latin as a literature. 
e4wWe Latin at sight and by hearing.—During this year the 
ons should do some reading at sight and by hearing. 
There are many small volumes available for this purpose. 
= but it is necessary to select the reading-matter carefully, 
, in order to avoid discouraging the pupils. A fable, or a
-P-A-G-E-99
  THIRD-YEAR LATIN 89 
short story, chapters from the Bible, as, for instance, the 
Twenty-third Psalm, the Pater Noster, the Beatitudes, 
are always interesting. These can be written on the black- 
board, or they can be used for hearing exercises. As good 
a plan as any is to re-read now and then some of the 
chapters from Caesar which were read the previous year. 
Go slowly in giving any new material, from Caesar or any- 
where else, unless you are sure that it is simple enough for 
your class. 
In the hearing exercise, read some simple story, as that 
of “Sir Walter Raleigh” in the Gradatim. Read a sentence 
and call for translation, then read over the entire story and 
see whether all can follow the thought. This exercise is 
well worth while. 
Prose composition, and else.—What was said under 
“Second-Year Latin’ about written exercises, the narra- 
tive, and a written translation is equally of importance 
during this year. In the oral and the written exercises, 
settle all questions on the authority of the grammar, which 
should be kept always at hand. 
The yearly theme.—For this essay, topics should be 
assigned several months before the close of the year, such as: 
Cicero, the Defender of the Republic 
Cicero as an Orator 
A Defense of Catiline 
A Prosecution of Catiline 
For Cicero and against Caesar 
For Caesar and against Cicero 
Catiline, the Friend of the Common People 
Political Parties in Rome 
A Defense of the Conspirators 
By co-operation with the English and history depart- 
ments, these papers and investigations may be made doubly 
effective.

If you buy in the order given, you will not be far wrong. 
The spare moments.—The history of Rome must 
furnish the background for this year’s work. You will be 
fortunate if your pupils have had a year of ancient or general 
history before reaching Cicero. Heavy stress must be laid 
on the life and customs of the people. The city itself, its 
topography and monuments, should be studied as time 
allows. The wall pictures, lantern slides, and other 
illustrative material referred to elsewhere, with those in 
the textbook, will help greatly in making Cicero’s orations 
interesting. Try to get each pupil to read one of the lives 
of Cicero and the volume by Church or by Johnston. The 
parallel between the political parties in Rome and in our 
country is worth presenting.
-P-A-G-E-101
  CHAPTER XII 
FOURTH-YEAR LATIN 
The text and the lesson.—What has been said elsewhere 
about selecting the text, organizing the class, reading at 
sight and by hearing, etc., applies also the fourth year. 
The year’s work.—For many years the work of the 
fourth year in Latin has been six books of Vergil’s Aeneid, 
or their equivalent. This amount of reading is generally 
considered excessive, and there is strong probability that 
it will be considerably reduced within a short time. Your 
classes should read as much as can be done comfortably, 
and no more. They should read at least four books of the 
Aeneid, preferably i, ii, iii, and vi. In addition, they 
should read from the other books, or from similar Latin, 
such an amount as will profitably occupy the time of the 
class. 
Unless you are required to do so by some fixed course 
of study, you will do your part by your class if you spend the 
year with Vergil. Classes which have used selections from 
Livy, Cicero’s essays, and similar Latin in place of Vergil 
have lost heavily. Vergil has influenced the world’s 
literature so largely that no pupil who can read his poems 
should be denied this privilege and pleasure. 
The daily assignment.—To begin with, your class 
should not take more than 15 or 20 lines a day, which will 
be enough until your pupils become accustomed to Latin 
poetry. If they have already read some selections from 
Ovid, this limit may be removed shortly. By the end of 
the second month, 30 lines will be reasonable, and the year’s 
or
-P-A-G-E-102
  92 TEACHING HIGH-SCHOOL LATIN 
daily. maximum of 4o lines ought to be within the reach 
. of the class by the end of the fourth month. ese are 
merely estimates. Some classes are better prepared than 
others, or are naturally stronger. Common-sense will 
necessarily determine your exact assignments. 
Dactylic hexameter.-Your class must become familiar 
with the dactylic hexameter during this year. During the 
earlier lessons it is best for you to scan the lessons and not 
expect this of ‘the pupils, as they are beginning a new kind 
of Latin and have all they can master. Let the class repeat 
the scansion of a few lines after you. Do this for a week or 
two. Then call for two lines written out each day, with the 
feet properly divided. By the end of the second month, 
require each pupil to scan the lines to be read. Gradually 
require the class to scan the day’s lesson in concert, scan- 
ning line by line yourself and letting the pupils repeat after 
you. They will become so very proficient that they will 
scan any of Vergil’s hexameters without effort and with very 
great pleasure. 
Prose composition.—If the course adopted requires it, 
continue the written work during this year, following the 
plans already outlined, and using a text somewhat more 
advanced than that of the previous year. If you can, sub- 
stitute for the written a great deal of oral work in class, 
based on the lesson read. Now and then, when time allows, 
send the class to the board and have the pupils write out 
the sentences given. This will make it possible for you 
to have five recitations a week, and the assignments may be 
made shorter. 
Outside reading.—During the year, each pupil should 
read some one of the handbooks on mythology, such as 
Guerber’s, or Gayley’s, and Church’s Story of the Cartha-
-P-A-G-E-103
  FOURTH-YEAR LATIN 93 
ginians. If possible, Benjamin’s Troy should be read also. 
Try to make arrangements with the English department by _ 
which your pupils may read translations of Homer’s [liad 
and Odyssey and Dante’s Divina Commedia as part of the 
required reading. If you can find time for fiction, let your 
class read some of the following: Flaubert’s Salammbo, 
the Maid of Carthage, Henry’s A Young Carthaginian, 
Gallazier’s Sorceress of Rome, Sienkiewicz’ Quo Vadis, and 
some of Crawford’s stories, as Cecilia, Heart of Rome, 
Saracinesca, Lady of Rome. 
A class play.—If the class is large enough, or if material 
from other sources is available, you will get good results 
from a play based on the reading of Vergil. Méiller’s 
Two Dramatizations from Vergil is good, but it will be 
necessary to cut out a great deal that is given, as there is 
entirely too much for one person to commit to memory 
without neglecting other work. Good results may be 
obtained by reading this play to the class as time permits. 
The yearly theme.—Follow the plan of the other years 
and require a yearly essay based on some phase of the study 
of the Aeneid. Themes on subjects like these will be 
helpful: 
Nature in the Aeneid 
Vergil’s Similes and Metaphors 
The Women of Vergil 
Excavations at Troy 
Excavations at Mycenae and Tiryns 
Omens and Oracles in the Aeneid 
The Geography of the Aeneid 
Birds and Animals in the Aeneid 
Visions and Dreams in the Aeneid 
Milton’s Debt to Vergil 
Dante’s Debt to Vergil 
 
-P-A-G-E-104
  94 TEACHING HIGH-SCHOOL LATIN 
Vergil’s Religion as seen in the Aeneid 
Vergil’s Debt to Homer 
Vergil’s Versification 
See also an article in the Classical Journal, III, 4, “The 
Topical Method in the Study of Vergil,” by Professor F. J. 
Miller. 
The spare moments.—During this year, careful atten- 
tion must be given to the study of mythology, and to this 
much of your spare time will be given. Pupils should study 
Vergil’s Aeneid as literature and not for purposes of syn- 
tactical analysis. The amount of extra syntax necessary 
to understand Vergil is very small, if the work of the other 
years has been well done. You should therefore plan for 
a part of each hour to be used in bringing your class into 
touch with the fine arts of the Greeks and Romans, par- 
ticularly sculpture. The photographs, prints, and lantern 
slides referred to elsewhere will do good service.. Look 
ahead and have the appropriate photographs or prints 
ready at the right time. Now and then read for the class 
a verse translation of a selection from the Iliad or the 
Odyssey. Also, read often from a translation of the 
Eclogues and Georgics of Vergil, and from the Metamorphoses 
of Ovid. The volumes of the: ‘Loeb Classical Library” 
are splendidly adapted to this purpose. By all means read 
to the class Tennyson’s “Oenone,” “Tithonus,” and 
“Vergil,” Shelley’s “Arethusa,” and Longfellow’s “Encela- 
dus,” even if something else must be neglected. Also, try 
to get some of the more beautiful passages committed to 
memory by the pupils, as, for instance, Book VI, 883-86, 
“manibus date lilia plenis”; i. 607-10, “In freta dum fluvii 
current,” etc.

  CHAPTER XIII 
LATIN PROSE COMPOSITION 
Latin writing generally required.—The value of writ- 
ing Latin as a means to an accurate knowledge of the forms 
and sentence structure of the language is generally recog- 
nized. Most of the high schools give one hour of recitation 
each week to this exercise, in addition to the time required 
for preparation out of class. The common plan is to assign 
a lesson from a prose composition text and to require the 
written work to be brought in for the teacher’s inspection. 
Resuus unsatisfactory.—The results which have come 
from Latin writing are generally poor and out of keeping 
with the time and energy expended. Few pupils can write 
simple Latin correctly at the time of their graduation, and 
it is doubtful whether we should expect them to do so. 
Men who have done work in advanced Latin are not neces- 
sarily accurate in this exercise. Certainly the results are 
very unsatisfactory. We are at fault somewhere—in our 
purpose, or in the plan followed. 
Trouble “based on Caesar,” in part.—For one thing, 
the books commonly used are partly responsible for our 
failure. In those “based on Caesar” and “based on 
Cicero,” there is generally a lack of gradation. The first 
sentences may be quite as difficult as those farther on, or 
even in the last part of the book. These books lack a simple 
starting-point for the beginner. They take entirely too 
“much for granted and overburden the student from the first. 
Some relief for this trouble would come from selecting 
a text which takes up one simple principle of syntax and 
96
-P-A-G-E-107
  LATIN PROSE COMPOSITION 97 
stays with it until it is thoroughly mastered. Not more 
than one main principle should appear in any lesson as a 
new part. Gradually, additions can be made, but it is 
best to take up new questions of syntax very slowly. 
There are a few texts of this kind available and teachers 
should insist on using them, in preference to the ‘‘based 
on something” kind. 
Change the sentences to ordinary topics.—The kind 
of sentence presented in the text is another burden on the 
teaching of Latin writing. Just why a boy should have 
Caesar and Cicero served up to him hot and cold, early and 
late, is more than one can explain. If he must read these 
altogether, why may he not vary his writing a little from 
the themes of such worthies? Why may he not’ write a 
story of something which touches his own life? Why 
not write a joke on a companion? A current story of 
local interest, a story taken from the day’s papers, or 
some other source, is just as good a basis for accurate 
writing as a string of stilted sentences about Ariovistus 
and Dumnorix. Teachers are advised to throw their prose 
texts to the winds now and then, and to offer the pupils 
an opportunity to bring in a story or joke of, say, forty or 
fifty words, according to grade. You will be surprised as 
well as amused, and even Latin teachers should smile now 
and then. It may require several exercises of this kind to 
enable pupils to find themselves and to get the knack of 
using words other than those of Caesar, but the experi- 
ment is well worth trying. If you will get a bulletin 
board and place these jokes and stories on exhibition, with 
an invitation to try others; your Latin prose class may 
become the center of a very enthusiastic interest. You 
may find it wise to censor these productions and to keep
-P-A-G-E-108
    98 TEACHING HIGH-SCHOOL LATIN 
back everything rude or otherwise contraband, also to see 
that the Latin is fairly accurate. Cartoons with Latin 
wording will dono harm. Anything to get pupils to learn 
forms and sentences is in place. 
Oral Latin as a substitute.—In view of the poor results, 
teachers would be justified in discontinuing the written 
exercise. The time can be used to better advantage in 
other work. For one thing, it is suggested that teachers 
use oral exercises more largely in place of written. If you 
have texts convenient, let pupils read the English sentence 
aloud and turn it into Latin. Other pupils may then be 
required to repeat the sentence in concert, as a means of 
holding the closest attention. Now and then give original 
sentences yourself, and call for the Latin equivalents. 
Invite your pupils to bring original sentences to the class. 
You can read these aloud and assign each to some particular 
pupil for an immediate report. If all others fail, require 
the one who presents a sentence to turn it into Latin. 
This plan does away with several evils: that of copying 
from a brighter pupil’s paper, or from an old exercise book 
that has come down almost from father to son; that of 
laboriously digging out the sentence, setting it down on a 
sheet of paper, and forgetting all about it forever afterward; 
and that of the teacher’s simply calling for the exercise, 
taking it home, and grading it in accordance with the keys 
furnished by the kind-hearted publishers. There may be 
other advantages, but this plan certainly does a good part 
toward keeping up the interest of a prose-composition class. 
See elsewhere.-The teaching of prose composition 
is treated more definitely in the discussion of the work of 
the second year, under the heading “Prose Composition,” 
pp. 85 f.

CHAPTER XIV 
THE LATIN BIBLE, LATIN HYMNS, AND SONGS 
A. The Latin Bible.—Students are always pleased 
when some part of the day’s lesson touches upon things 
in which they are ordinarily interested. You can make use 
of this characteristic by keeping a copy of the Latin New 
Testament on your desk, as it will be a means of awakening 
many a boy and turning to good account an hour that 
started off without promise. The Twenty-third Psalm, 
the Beatitudes, the Lord’s Prayer, and other familiar 
selections offer themselves, and you will be delighted 
with the reception which will greet your reading of these 
passages. F 
You can add to the interest by reading the Latin 
sentence and calling for someone to repeat it. Then let 
some pupil give an English passage and call on the class 
to turn it into Latin. An English concordance at hand 
will help in finding these passages. Sometimes pupils 
will wish to commit passages to memory. In this case, 
place these passages on the blackboard. 
The Beza edition of the New Testament and Psalms 
in Latin and the Latin Vulgate Bible may be ordered from 
any general bookstore. The Vulgate Bible is now under- 
going revision and the new edition will doubtless be 
available shortly. 
Some selections-—That you may be able to test this 
use of Bible selections, a few passages are given which 
you may use in your classes at some favorable oppor- 
tunity.

B. Latin hymns.—You may use a few Latin hymns in 
a similar way. Young people are always glad to sing, if 
it means relief from class work for the time being. Schools 
can use this disposition to good purposes now and then, 
especially when times of stress and nerve strain call for 
some means of averting trouble. A Latin song is very 
effective, and a class can usually be interested by the first 
suggestion of such a song. Latin hymns are frequently 
given with English translations; this can be turned to good 
account, as by reading the Latin to the class and inviting 
an English translation. 
The Latin hymns are a great literature in themselves 
and for their own sake are worth knowing. The modern 
churches make use of a limited number in translations, and 
these constitute about the best we have in our hymnals. 
Some do not lend themselves to translation readily, but 
they should still have a place in our singing. The audience 
would not be able to follow the thought, it is true, but very 
few of us know what is being said by the choir anyway, 
and we have to take for granted that it is all right. If we 
knew that they were singing one of the great Latin hymns, 
that fact would afford no little satisfaction, and would 
compensate us for our inability to find words in the 
sounds made. 
Some selected hymns.—The following Latin hymns, 
simple in thought and easy of translation, are given in 
order that teachers may try the effect of them upon their 
classes:

also been ascribed to Robert II of France, and others, 
may likewise be used: 
Veni, Sancte Spiritus, 
Et emitte caelitus 
Lucis trae radium. 
Veni, pater pauperum, 
Veni, dator munerum, 
Veni, lumen cordium. 
Consulator optime, 
Dulcis hospes animae, 
Dulce refrigerium In !abore requies, 
In aestu temperies, 
In fletu solatium. 
O lux beatissima, 
Reple cordis intima 
Tuorum fidelium. 
Sine tuo numine 
Nihil est in homine, 
Nihil est innoxium.

Lava quod est sordidum, 
Riga quod est aridum, 
Sana quod est saucium, 
Flecte quod est rigidum,

Music: Found in all hymnals, usually with a translation, 
“Come, Holy Ghost, in Love, Shed on Us from Above.” 
The tune “ New Haven” is commonly used. 
3. The following hymn, by Thomas of Celano, is readily 
learned by even very young students because of its simple 
meter and the rather charming rhyme: 
Dies irae, dies illa 
Solvet saeclum in favilla 
Teste David cum Sibylla. 
Quantus tremor est futurus 
Quando index est venturus, 
Cuncta stricte discussurus! 
Tuba, mirum spargens sonum 
Per sepulcra regionum, 
Coget omnes ante thronum. 
Mors stupebit, et natura, 
Cum resurget creatura 
Indicanti responsura. 
Liber scriptus proferetur, 
In quo totum continetur, 
Unde mundus iudicetur. Index ergo cum sedebit, 
Quidquid latet, apparebit, 
Nil inultum remanebit. 
Quid sum miser tunc dicturus, 
Quem patronum rogaturus, 
Cum vix iustus sit securus ? 
Rex tremendae maiestatis, 
Qui salvandos salvas gratis, 
Salva me, fons pietatis. 
Recordare, Iesu pie, 
Quod sum causa tuae viae; 
Ne me perdas illa die! 
Quaereus me sedisti lassus, 
Redemisti crucem passus: 
Tantus labor non sit cassus! 
Iuste iudex ultionis, 
Donum fac remissionis 
Ante diem rationis!
-P-A-G-E-114
  104 TEACHING HIGH-SCHOOL LATIN 
Music: “Dies Irae,” found in all hymnals, usually with a 
translation entitled ‘‘Day of Wrath, O Dreadful Day.” 
4. Another hymn which will interest students is Glad- 
stone’s rendering of Toplady’s “Rock of Ages”: 
Iesu, pro me perforatus, 
Condar intra tuum latus, 
Tu per lympham profluentem, 
Tu per sanguinem tepentem, 
In peccata mi redunda, 
Tolle culpam, sordes munda. 
Coram te nec iustus forem, 
Quamvis tota vi laborem, 
Nec si fide nunquam cesso, 
Fletu stillans indefesso: 
Tibi soli tantum, munus; 
Salva me, Salvator unus! Nil in manu mecum fero, 
Sed me versus crucem gero; 
Vestimenta nudus oro, 
Opem debilis imploro; 
Fontem Christi quaeroimmundus, 
* Nisi laves, moribundus. 
Dum hos artus vita regit; 
Quando nox sepulchro tegit; 
Mortuos cum stare iubes; 
Sedens iudex inter nubes; 
Iesu, pro me perforatus, 
Condar intra tuum latus. 
Music: “Rock of Ages,” found in all hymnals. The last 
two syllables are read as one. 
There are others in large numbers which can be used 
to good advantage, and teachers will do a large service for 
general culture by bringing them to the attention of their 
classes. “Te Deum laudamus,” by St. Ambrose; “Grates 
nunc omnes reddamus,” by Nokter, of St. Gall; ““O quanta 
qualia sunt illa Sabbata,” by Abelard; ‘“‘Stabat mater 
dolorosa,” by Innocent III; ‘Jerusalem luminosa,” by 
an unknown author; “Arx firma Deus noster est,” Butt- 
man’s rendering of Luther’s “ Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott,” 
are worthy of the time and effort of anyone who would 
think the great thoughts of the choicest minds of all ages. 
Books.—These books may be obtained, and they are 
worth buying, especially the last, which contains other 
Latin songs together with some of the best hymns:

Latin Hymn Writers and Their Hymns by S. Duffield 
Latin Songs, with Music, by Professor Calvin S. Brown 
C. Latin Songs.—What was said of Latin hymns is 
equally in place for Latin songs, with the additional con- 
sideration that songs can be used on many occasions where 
the hymns cannot. 
Some selected songs——In order that you may test this 
plan, a few Latin songs are given: 
1. “Lauriger Horatius,” by an unknown author; 
Lauriger Horatius, 
Quam dixisti verum: 
Fugit Euro citius 
Tempus edax rerum. 
Cuorus. Ubi sunt, O pocula, 
Dulciora melle,

2. “Gaudeamus Igitur,” by an unknown author: 
Gaudeamus igitur, 
Iuvenes dum sumus; 
Gaudeamus igitur, 
Tuvenes dum sumus; 
Post iucundam iuventutem. 
Post molestam senectutem, 
Nos habebit humus, 
Nos habebit humus. 
Ubi sunt qui ante nos 
In mundo fuere ? 
Ubi sunt qui ante nos

Music: ‘‘Gaudeamus,” found in a number of the popu- 
lar songbooks, also those used for school purposes, as The 
Academy Song Book, published by Ginn & Co., which has a 
number of Latin songs. 
3. “Integer Vitae,” by Horace:

  CHAPTER XV 
CLASSROOM EQUIPMENT FOR THE LATIN DEPARTMENT 
Teachers of Latin have not generally urged upon the 
school authorities, their need of classroom equipment and 
consequently this has received little attention. It is quite 
as important for the Latin teacher to have a modern equip- 
ment for his work as it is for the teacher of any subject 
in the course of study. 
For a long time teachers of science were unable to secure 
any laboratory facilities, but a better day has dawned for 
the sciences. It is now comparatively easy for science 
teachers to convince the school authorities of their need of 
laboratory materials, and this is very fortunate. The 
Latin teacher, also, must press his needs upon the attention 
of his school board. Without proper equipment, he can- 
not hope to do his best work nor get the most satisfactory 
results. : 
Some needs of the Latin room: 
1. Charts..--The Latin classroom should have the 
following wall maps: Ancient Italy, Ancient Gaul, Ancient 
Rome, Ancient Greece, the Roman Empire. Either the 
“Kiepert Classical Series” or the “Kampen Classical 
Series”? will prove satisfactory, although the latter are 
preferable. Buy your charts mounted on spring rollers 
and boxed. 
2. Books.— 
a) General, for the class.— 
Necessary: Lewis, Latin Dictionary; Smith, English- 
Latin Dictionary; Harper, Classical Dictionary; Platner, 
108
-P-A-G-E-119
  
CLASSROOM EQUIPMENT 109 
Ancient Rome; Mau-Kelsey, Pompeii; Tarbell, Greek 
Sculpture; Fowler, Roman Literature; Huelsen, Roman 
Forum (translation); Sandys, Companion to Latin Studies 
(very important); Kiepert, Classical Atlas; Johnston, 
Latin Manuscripts. 
Desirable: Harper, Latin Dictionary; Lanciani, Ancient 
Rome; Gayley, Classics Myths in English Literature; 
Teuffel and Schwabe, History of Roman Literature (trans- 
lation by Warr); Bulfinch, Age of Fable; Schreiber, Ailas 
of Classical Antiquities; von Mach, Greek and Roman 
Sculpture Prints, with Handbook. 
b) Mainly for your own use.— 
Absolutely necessary: (1) Kelsey, Latin and Greek in 
American Education; you cannot get along without this 
book; (2) the Classical Weekly, Professor Charles Knapp, 
editor, Columbia University Press, New York City; 
(3) the Classical Journal, Professor Frank J. Miller, editor, 
The University of Chicago Press, Chicago; (4) Art and 
Archaeology, Professor D. M. Robinson, editor; Archaeologi- 
cal Institute of America, Washington, D.C. These three 
magazines are indispensable. 
Desirable: Ashmore, The Classics and Modern Training; 
Babbitt, Literature in the American College; Harrington, 
Live Issues in Classical Study; Showerman, The Professor; 
Byrne, Syntax of High School Latin; Lodge, High School 
Latin Vocabulary; Bennett and Bristol, The Teaching of 
Latin and Greek in the Secondary School. You should also 
have a copy of The Relation of Latin to Practical Life, by 
Miss Frances Ellis Sabin of the University of Wisconsin, 
Madison, Wisconsin. 
In addition to these books, the Latin classroom should 
have a good number of the school editions of the authors
-P-A-G-E-120
  110 TEACHING HIGH-SCHOOL LATIN 
read, the more the better, and all the Latin grammars 
commonly referred to in the editions of the authors. It is 
worth while to have a number of the texts used in Latin 
prose composition, particularly for purposes of comparison. 
The teacher should endeavor to secure copies of every 
available text for beginning Latin students, and if a few 
of those used in Canada and England are secured they will 
prove decidedly suggestive and helpful. 
3. Wall Pictures.—-Every Latin classroom should have 
a number of photographic enlargements of important 
features of Rome and the adjacent region. The following 
are of interest: the Forum, one view looking east and one 
looking west; the Colosseum, the Pantheon, the Arches 
of Titus, Septimius Severus, and Constantine, the Tomb of 
Hadrian, and the Tiber River; a view of Pompeii with 
Vesuvius in the background. A view of the Acropolis and 
the Parthenon is also desirable. 
Any of the dealers in lantern slides and photographs 
can furnish photographic prints which can be readily 
enlarged. The Soule Art Publishing Company, Boston, 
Massachusetts, and the Records of the Past Exploration 
Society, Washington, D.C., will send prints on approval, 
and from these you can make selections which they will 
enlarge and frame, if you wish. 
The size and plan of your classroom and the subject of 
the picture will determine the size of the pictures that will 
harmonize with their surroundings. These sizes are good: 
24X30, 22X32, 27X37, 25X35, 22X28, 20X26. Smaller 
sizes can be made, as 14X18, 12X16, and on down. Plan 
your sizes to fit into the wall space available. The bromide 
enlargements will serve every purpose. 
4. Sculptures.—High schools may not often be in a 
position to purchase even plaster copies of classic sculp-
-P-A-G-E-121
  
CLASSROOM EQUIPMENT III 
tures, but, if possible, busts of the authors read should be 
secured. Prices range from about $10 up. The Boston 
Sculpture Company, Boston, Massachusetts, and P. P. 
Caproni & Brother, Boston, Massachusetts, will send full 
information. 
5. Lantern Slides.—Every high school should have a 
lantern. Those which can should also provide lanterns 
for the main classrooms. The outlay is small in compari- 
son with the service rendered. Extra shades will readily 
darken the windows and make it possible to use illustrative 
material at the right time. 
Any of the large supply houses will furnish lanterns 
and slides—as Williams, Brown & Earle, Philadelphia; 
McIntosh Stereopticon Company, Chicago; and T. H. 
McAllister Company, New York. The small lanterns 
furnished by the Bausch & Lomb Optical Company, 
Rochester, New York, are as good as any for your purposes. 
The following sets of slides are of particular interest 
to Latin teachers: 
a) Professor F. C. Eastman, University of Towa, Iowa 
City, Iowa. For use in the high schools of Iowa, Professor 
Eastman has prepared sets of slides, with about fifty in 
each set, for illustrating the subjects discussed by high- 
school classes. The sets are: (1) The Roman House; 
(2) Roman Games and Amusements; (3) Roman Wearing- 
Apparel; (4) Correspondence and Travel; (5) Roman 
‘Trades and Crafts; (6-8) Sets Illustrating Caesar, Cicero, 
and Vergil. 
These sets have been in demand in various parts 
of the country, and while they were not planned with 
a view to general sale, it will be possible to secure any 
of the sets from Professor Eastman at very reasonable 
prices. 
 
-P-A-G-E-122
  112 TEACHING HIGH-SCHOOL LATIN 
b) Mr. W. C. Ives, Grafton, New Hampshire—One of 
the best collections of negatives of classical subjects yet 
made is that of Professor Charles Upson Clark, formerly 
of Yale University, now director of the American School 
_ of Classical Studies in Rome, Italy. He has placed all 
his slides in charge of Mr. Ives, who will make slides or 
photographic enlargements of any of the photographs. 
Prints will be furnished from which to make selections. 
c) Arthur-S. Cooley, Lehigh University, South Bethlehem, 
Pennsylvania.—Dr. Cooley has a large collection of slides, 
and has made arrangements for supplying them to teachers 
and others. He also rents slides at fair rates. 
d) Special authors-—Mr. George R. Swain, Ann Arbor, 
Michigan, has a large collection of slides for illustrating 
Caesar. The Records of the Past Exploration Society, 
Washington, D.C., will furnish a very good set of 40 slides 
for illustrating the Aeneid of Vergil. Quite recently they 
have announced several other sets which appear attractive. 
6. Photographs.---Any of the dealers in lantern slides 
can furnish photographs of value to Latin teachers. If 
time permits, orders sent to the following addresses will 
be properly attended to: Alinari & Cook, Corso Umberto, 
Rome, Italy; D. Anderson, Via Salaria, Rome, Italy; Eng- 
lish Photographic Company, care of W. Barth, Athens, 
Greece. Supplies of this kind ordered for educational 
institutions are admitted free of duty. 
7. Coins.—A few coins, genuine if possible, will add 
greatly to the interest of your Latin teaching. They may 
be had of: S. H. Chapman, Drexel Building, Philadelphia; 
Henry Chapman, 1348 Pine Street, Philadelphia. 
Electro copies of any of the coins in the British Museum 
may be had at reasonable prices, by writing to the Curator.
-P-A-G-E-123
    CLASSROOM EQUIPMENT I13- 
8. Home-made illustrative materials.—In every class 
there may be some students of a mechanical turn of mind, 
and these are easily interested in making, in model, copies 
of objects which are daily kept before the class, particularly 
while reading Caesar. 
Dimensions for such things as the pilum, hasta, gladius, 
Sicca, scorpio, tormenta, scutum, and the like, may be found 
in the various reference books, as can good wood-cuts. 
From these, even where accurate dimensions are not 
obtainable, satisfactory working estimates can be made 
which will answer every purpose. The famous bridge can 
be built by any boy who makes the effort, and the teacher 
who has not had this done should busy himself immediately. 
Also he can make, or get a student to make the vinea, 
scorpio, aries, turris, and similar implements, fairly good 
designs for which are given in the textbooks. 
It is very profitable to have some of the girl students 
make, in model also, articles of dress, as the toga, stola, 
and the like. Some teachers find it possible to have one 
or more togas, pairs of sandals, stolas, etc., of full size, a 
practice which is commendable wherever practicable. If 
suitable miniature figures are obtainable, good results 
may be obtained by having these dressed completely, one 
each as imperator, legatus, centurio, and so on, after the 
designs given in the various texts. 
This list does not include a large number of reliable 
houses from which supplies may be secured. It has seemed 
better to give a few of the best, rather than a complete list. 
Those who prefer a larger number from which to select any 
articles wanted will find such a list, prepared by Miss 
Loura B. Woodruff, in the Classical Journal, X1, 3.

  CHAPTER XVI 
QUESTIONS, WITH ANSWERS AND SUGGESTIONS 
Questions in large numbers.—Immediately after the 
publication of the Handbook referred to in the preface, there 
came to its editor a veritable flood of questions in which 
young Latin teachers in every section of the country 
showed their earnest desire to improve their teaching and 
to remedy certain conditions which were facing them. 
Some questions were of a personal nature and were con- 
cerned with problems of a local character, but a large 
majority were very similar, showing that teachers of high- 
school Latin are facing practically the same difficulties 
everywhere. Answer was made to these questions in so 
far as opportunity allowed, and for the benefit of young 
teachers some of these are given here. ; 
When should we begin Latin?—-If we could work under 
ideal conditions, without question we should favor begin- 
ning Latin sooner in the course of study than is now cus- 
tomary, say as early as the sixth or seventh grade, as is 
done in some of the schools in Europe. If we could begin 
at that time and use a simpler text, possibly a modification 
of the so-called ‘‘direct-method” plan, some of the more 
troublesome problems of the teacher might be solved. 
However, it is probable that Latin will remain fixed where 
it is, in the high school, and we must make it as effective 
there as possible. 
What about translations?—They are a great nuisance, 
and a great barrier to effective Latin teaching. Certain 
publishers circularize schools all over the country, sending 
114 5
-P-A-G-E-125
  
QUESTIONS, ANSWERS, AND SUGGESTIONS TI5 
their advertising matter to every pupil whose name they 
can get from catalogues, or otherwise. The result is that 
practically every high-school pupil knows where he can get 
a translation for 50 cents. Sometimes one of these copies 
passes from one class to another for years. Teachers are 
practically helpless. Once'in a while. they find out who 
uses a translation, but generally they cannot tell. Some 
wise men assure us that they can “‘spot a pony on his first 
bray,” but it isa vain fancy. They do so only by accident, 
if at all. : 
Classical study and modern languages in the same way 
have suffered because of this too common use of transla- 
tions. We all know that these things block our best efforts 
to make Latin effective as an educational instrument, but 
the remedy has not been discovered. The following sug- 
gestions have been made by various teachers: 
1. Appeal to the honor of the class and urge the pupils 
not to use translations. Explain the hopelessness of the 
effort to learn Latin without hard work. Show them that 
it is dishonest to use a translation taken from a book and 
pretend that it is their own. If they use a translation, 
they should be open and frank about it. You may make 
some headway by this plan. If there is no sense of honor 
~ to appeal to, you can do nothing. 
2. At the opening of the term explain your opposition 
to the use of translations, give your reasons for your posi- 
tion, and ask those who took the course expecting to use a 
translation to take something else, as they are not wanted 
in the Latin classes. Some of the lazier pupils may forsake 
you if you make this request. 
3. Let it be understood that your examinations will be 
based mainly on new work; that is, that you will give large
-P-A-G-E-126
  116 TEACHING HIGH-SCHOOL LATIN 
credit for new passages which will be assigned from parts 
of the book not read in class. For this let the pupils have 
the vocabulary just as when preparing the lesson at home. 
They ought to know that translations will fail them in a 
test like that, and that the sensible course for them is to 
do their own work as they go along and to learn how to do 
any task assigned them. 
4. Assign lessons which can be done within a reasonable 
time, without overtaxing your class. The translation 
habit is sometimes traceable to unreasonably long lessons. 
Even honest students feel under such circumstances that 
they cannot hope to do all the work required and so they 
have recourse to the inviting ‘“‘trot.”” No matter if the 
standard requirement does call for so much Latin, do what 
your class can do well, and with fair consideration for other 
departments, and let the rest go undone. Make definite 
assignments in construction. Do not call for any and all 
sorts of constructions each day. Begin on one or two things 
in syntax, as has been repeatedly urged, and move on 
evenly, adding one thing at a time and leaving a construc- 
tion when it is learned. 
5. Be careful about suspecting pupils of using transla- 
tions. If you feel sure that a boy is doing so, you had best 
tell him of your fears privately. It is likely that he will 
grow indignant and say too much. Be sure of your ground, 
therefore, and talk the matter over with him alone. The 
class will side with the pupil if anything personal is brought 
up. A good way to handle a suspected case is to give 
that student no opportunity to translate, but to hold him 
rigidly to account for the assigned syntax. The translation 
devotee does not often prepare his syntax. If you let him 
read at all, require him to translate word by word. Ordi-
-P-A-G-E-127
  
QUESTIONS, ANSWERS, AND SUGGESTIONS 117 
narily this is a bad plan, but it does break into the ‘“per- 
sonal liberty” of the translation fiend to rattle over the 
page. Let him give Latin word and English equivalent, 
word by word, and he will be forced to work out his lesson 
somewhat closely even if he does hold to his handy mount. 
Should Latin be required of all pupils ?—That depends 
upon the nature of the school. Some private institutions 
regularly require Latin of all their pupils, and will admit 
no one who does not want Latin. This is entirely right 
for such schools. For public schools, however, it is not the 
best policy to require all pupils to take Latin, although a 
school board has a right to require it if the members 
believe it to be the best thing for a particular school. 
Public schools are trying to reach out and to serve all classes 
of pupils, those who have good, strong minds and those who 
have no minds worth mentioning. Such weaker pupils 
will be greatly helped by four years of a high school, and 
something must be offered of a kind that will appeal to 
them and still train them in some direction. The absurdity 
comes in when school principals and others try to make 
the public believe that a course of study made up of half- 
worked-out subjects is as effective as the Latin or so-called 
classical course, and that the graduates of the various 
departments are on an equal basis. “Rejoice and be 
exceeding glad” that you do not have to worry Latin into 
the heads of those who cannot receive it. Do your best 
to make men and women out of those who can take Latin. 
How about the “direct method of teaching Latin”?—So 
far, it is largely experimental. There are possibilities in the 
plan, but a very thorough mastery of Latin is required in 
order to succeed with it. Its use is confined mainly to a 
few English schools, with occasional experiments in this 
 
-P-A-G-E-128
118 TEACHING HIGH-SCHOOL LATIN 
country. It would undoubtedly work out well if we could 
begin Latin earlier in the grades. 
The movement is worthy of careful investigation. The 
books prepared for this method may be had of the Oxford 
University Press, American Branch, New York City. 
Where can I get arguments in favor of Latin?—The 
best argument a teacher can give in favor of his subject 
is found in his teaching. No matter how powerful he may 
be in his arguments in favor of Latin, if he does not do 
good work as a teacher he will not help the cause of Latin 
by his arguments. Then, too, controversy is not often 
profitable for a young teacher. You should know the value 
of your subject and when you find the right opportunity 
your evidence will help your cause. 
If you should find someone who is really seeking after 
the facts with an open mind, you may be justified in trying 
to furnish him with data that will satisfy any reasonable 
man. The best. available source is Professor Kelsey’s 
Latin and Greek in American Education, especially Pro- 
fessor Shorey’s article. Study this closely, and watch the 
references in the footnotes, a valuable part of the paper. 
You will probably find in that volume enough for any con- 
dition that may face you. If you need other material, get 
Miss Sabin’s book, The Relation of Latin to Practical Life, 
and the pamphlets issued by the publicity committee of 
the Classical Association of the Middle West and South, 
“Arguing with Bob,” “Bob Goes to College,” etc. Then 
some of the following arguments touched upon in this book 
may help you: 
x. Our language and literature are largely borrowed 
from the Latin (see “English in Latin Study’’).
-P-A-G-E-129
  
QUESTIONS, ANSWERS, AND SUGGESTIONS 119 
2. Latin is the basis of all the Romance languages, 
French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, etc. One cannot 
thoroughly understand these languages without a knowl- 
edge of Latin; and a pupil who does know Latin can learn 
them in half the time required by the non-Latin student 
to get a smattering. 
3. Our civilization is largely derived from the Roman, 
including our laws, political customs, religion, and even our 
everyday customs. Few realize the extent of our obliga- 
tion to the Romans. Not only have we taken over these 
laws, etc., but the very words by which we name them are 
of Latin origin. 
4. Latin has for centuries been a factor in our education. 
It could not have held its place if it had not been effective 
as an instrument in making educated men and women. 
Substitutes now being tried have so far failed utterly as 
regards the type of scholar turned out. 
5. The world’s laws, politics, customs, and education 
have been largely based on those developed in Rome, even 
as the highest type of religion spread from the Eternal City. 
What can I do about this “vocation” business ?—There 
is a great deal of common-sense back of the general demand 
for training that will help in making a living. Young 
people should grow up with the fact before them that they 
will some day be expected to do their part as men and 
women. Those who study Latin should know how to earn 
a livelihood, and those who put their whole thought upon 
making the livelihood would be better off if they also studied 
Latin. Latin teachers, therefore, are as much interested 
in vocational training as anybody else, and they should give 
it due encouragement.
-P-A-G-E-130
  120 TEACHING HIGH-SCHOOL LATIN 
Vocational training in this country is unfortunately 
burdened and there is danger that a good cause may be 
permanently damaged in consequence, for the following 
reasons: (1) All the faddists who have been chasing 
fantasies for a generation have taken up the slogan of 
vocational. training. With sober-minded people, their 
advocacy arouses prejudice against any cause they may 
espouse. (2) These faddists attack other subjects, Latin 
in particular, and thus antagonize a great many people 
unnecessarily. People who have studied Latin have made 
good citizens and are as successful in making a living as 
the vocationist could wish. (3) The advocates of voca- 
tional training make a mistake in forcing it upon the ordi- 
nary schools, rather than establishing special schools for 
this purpose, wherever students are available in sufficiently 
large numbers. If vocational training is to become effec- 
tive in the sense of trade schools, separate schools are abso- 
lutely necessary. If our present schools become efficient 
vocational schools, they will cease to be of value for any 
other purpose. General education or special training will 
fail in the experiment, possibly both. (4) The main point 
is well stated by Dean Bagley: “Most of those who advo- 
cate early vocational differentiation are not thinking of 
their own children. Of course a broad and liberal training 
is presupposed for them. These opportunities for early 
vocational choices are for other people’s children.’” 
You will do the right thing if you help along the cause 
of vocational training wherever possible, regardless of the 
lack of good judgment shown by some of those who try

to monopolize the movement. You have as much at stake 
as anybody. 
How can I test my work?—There are several fairly 
satisfactory tests which one can apply to his own work, 
but in the very nature of the case the outcome must remain 
largely subjective. One will see what one is looking for. 
Interest in the work, enthusiasm for the cause of the classics, 
and similar evidences are encouraging, but the following 
are about the most accurate tests that we can use: (1) the 
number of your graduates who, on entering college, con- 
tinue their Latin; (2) the number who maintain them- 
selves with credit in the Latin department of higher 
institutions. 
Colleges generally know what to expect of the graduates 
of particular high schools. Some of these enter for good 
hard work from the very first, while other groups on arrival 
have a complete familiarity with the “snap” courses and 
the “easy” professors, and devote themselves to the latter 
assiduously. 
High schools which do good work in Latin send out 
students who are conscious of their ability and preparedness 
to take their places with the representatives of any and all 
other high schools, and they enter college with a determina- 
tion to measure up to the very best. Poor preparatory 
training is promotive of intellectual cowardice, which asserts 
itself nowhere more decidedly than in Latin and mathe- 
matics. If your graduates take Latin in college generally 
and maintain good records, you are doing high-grade work 
in your department. 
How can I wake up my school to the value of Latin?— 
1. Make sure that you are yourself awake. A sleepy 
teacher will make a sleepy classroom. A sleepy teacher

will practically kill any subject he may teach, no matter 
what it is. 
2. Join one of the classical associations referred to 
elsewhere and get into touch with what the live teachers 
are doing in other schools. This duty of every Latin 
teacher is well-nigh imperative. The writer knows per- 
sonally a large number of young Latin teachers, and he 
gives it as his testimony that he does not know a single one 
who belongs to one of these associations and reads the 
Classical Journal or Classical Weekly who is not succeeding 
in his work as a teacher. You greatly need the help that 
these associations and these journals will give you. 
3. Elsewhere a play is suggested. One of the following 
may prove interesting: (1) Two Latin Plays for High 
School Students, by Susan Paxson (Ginn & Co.); (2) Easy 
Latin Plays (George Bell & Sons, London); (3) Classical 
Stories Dramatized for School Use, by L. O. Lennart (Enter- 
tainment Publishing Co.); (4) Two Dramatizations from 
Vergil, by Professor F. J. Miller (The University of Chicago 
Press); (5) Latin Plays, by Professor J. J. Schleicher 
(Ginn & Co.). 
4. Form a Latin club, and now and then get your pupils 
together for combined business and social purposes. Try 
to have an invited guest on each such evening to address 
the club, briefly and pointedly, stressing some phase of 
classical study. Pupils themselves will sometimes prepare 
papers, as a result of an investigation which you can 
direct. 
5. Send for Classical, Mediaeval and Modern Latin 
Songs, with Music, by Calvin S. Brown (Putnam), and get 
your whole neighborhood to singing Latin songs. Select 
one or two of the best and teach them to your classes,
-P-A-G-E-133
  
QUESTIONS, ANSWERS, AND SUGGESTIONS 123 
Now and then arrange to have them sung at the daily 
gatherings of the student body. 
6. Read this book through again, and see if you have 
done all the things suggested. If not, doing them might 
solve your problem.   
The Classical Associations.—There are several classical © 
associations, one of which is entitled to your sympathy 
and help, and in turn is ready to be of great assistance to 
you in your work as a teacher. They are as follows: the 
Classical Association of New England; the Classical Asso- 
ciation of the Atlantic states; the Classical Association of 
the Middle West, and South; the Classical Association of 
the Pacific Coast. 
These associations are upholding the cause of classical 
education, and their meetings will help you. The Classical 
Journal (The University of Chicago Press) or the Classical 
Weekly (New York) will give you any information you 
wish about membership in any one of these associations. 
Or you may make inquiry of the head of the department 
of Latin in your state university or college. 
Your state teachers’ association probably has a classical 
section that you should join, if you have not already done 
so. Be on your watch for such organizations, and do your 
full part.   
Book houses.---The general bookstores in the cities can 
secure for you any volume referred to in this book. In 
order to avoid delays, you will be absolutely safe if you 
send such orders to The University of Chicago Press, 
Chicago, Illinois. Information as to prices, and the like, 
can also be had for the asking.

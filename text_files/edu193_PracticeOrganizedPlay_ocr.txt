  PREFACE 
The Play teacher of to-day is fortunate in being able to turn 
to any number of good books containing plays and games for all 
ages and occasions. The very abundance of play collections makes 
it unnecessary for this book to offer new suggestions for like ma- 
terial. Rather, the purpose is to give a clear presentation of the 
many popular plays, games, tests, and competitive sports already 
in use. 
Primarily, this work is a textbook. It is especially designed 
to serve the students in the normal schools and colleges. Therefore, 
it aims to make the student comprehend the whole play system 
rather than be familiar with any one particular scheme. The 
tendency has been to instruct either from the kindergarten stand- 
point of knowing a wide variety of plays and games, or from the 
coaching aspect of intensive knowledge of a few competitive forms 
of sport. Such training is not adequate, for the graduate play 
student should be well equipped in a general way to meet the task 
of teaching. The athletic coach may be called upon to supervise 
a whole system; and the general recreation teacher may need to 
explain the rules of competitive sports, to instruct in coaching, or 
to promote leagues in baseball, soccer, and the like. 
It is in keeping with this general aim that the classifications have 
been planned as they are found in this book. Although play 
activities of like nature have been grouped together, there has been 
preserved at the same time the idea of progression. Particularly 
so, in leading up to our highly specialized team games, has this 
idea been carried through by tracing the development through the 
individualistic and mildly codperative stages. This step-by-step 
acquaintanceship should give beginners a more intelligent view- 
point of many of our standard games of baseball, tennis, football, 
basket ball, hockey, etc., than they now possess. It is a typical 
fault of our rule books that they do not describe a game clearly, 
but present it from the standpoint of thé skilled player or of the 
official. A clear description of a game, followed by the chance 
to see it played, and then a chance to play it, is the best way to 
become acquainted with rules that are complicated.

    PREFACE 
The book deals mostly with things of everyday use. As regards 
activities that come up occasionally, it gives casual treatment, and 
adds references to books that cover specific fields more completely. 
The theoretical aspect of Play has been omitted entirely, as it is 
being dealt with by the authors in a separate book called The 
Theory of Organized Play. 
We are indebted to Miss Ethel Perrin, of Detroit, and Miss 
Ethel Rockwell, of Kalamazoo, for the use of several Story Plays 
of which they are the original authors. 
The authors are indebted to the many other works that con- 
tribute to the subject of Play. Many of them have proved a 
guidance and help. In addition, Mr. C. E. Brewer, of the Detroit 
Recreation Department, has kindly given permission to use the 
Rules and Regulations in Administration which appear in the 
appendix to this volume.

CHAPTER I 
PLAYS OF SIMPLE IMITATION 
Children from the age four to eight enjoy simple imitative 
activities the best of any kind of play, and older pupils now and 
then will take a lively interest in them. The plays of this type 
that have proven most useful are described below. 
I Saw. 
Tell the players of some action you have seen, then imitate 
it; tell them they are to imitate it too. Examples: mowing grass; 
picking apples and placing them in a basket; chopping wood; a 
tall man walking (on toes); a short man walking (knees bent) ; 
a lame chicken (hopping on one foot); a pendulum swinging 
(resting on hands on desks), etc. When they get the idea, ask 
who has seen an action he would like to imitate, and have players 
lead, each showing one action. Encourage a variety of actions 
and those that are vigorous enough for good exercise. Some 
can be done with pupils standing by their seats; others involve walk- 
ing or running, and then the line must move forward and pass 
around a course to the starting point. 
The Wee Bologna Man. 
This is like “I Saw,” but several leaders are chosen beforehand 
and stationed at the front or near it so as to be ready to take part 
quickly in turn. As soon as one leader is through he returns to 
his place and the next comes quickly forward and begins. In place 
of naming or describing the action as in “I Saw,” the leader per- 
forms it in rhythm with the following rhyme: 
“I’m the Wee Bologna Man. 
Always do the best you can 
To follow the Wee Bologna Man.” 
The actions imitated may be any kind of gymnastic exercises, 
athletic feats, forms of labor, playing musical instruments, actions 
of animals, etc. Each leader continues to lead the class for a few

  2 THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
moments, the length of time to be determined from time to time 
by suggestions from the teacher, and is promptly followed by the 
next. Success depends on ingenuity of leaders in choosing themes, 
accuracy of imitation, so that the others can understand what was 
meant, and promptness. 
Follow the Leader. 
Like “I Saw” and “The Wee Bologna Man,” but the leader ’ 
may do several things in succession; in fact, success depends on his 
giving an interesting variety of movements. In the simplest form 
of the play the players stand in place and take such exercises as 
can be done in place; in another form they march-in single file 
behind the leader and imitate whatever he does. Practice in the 
simpler plays of this kind should prepare the players to do this well. 
The Serpentine Maze. 
Players all in single file, teacher leading. Each player reaches 
right hand forward to player next in front and left hand back, 
grasping hands. March forward, circling to left and winding up 
into a spiral. When tightly wound, march in reverse direction, 
last player leading, and unwind, then wind up, circling to right. 
Several variations should be used later: 
(1) Same as first method without grasping hands. 
(2) When wound as tightly as will leave enough space, teacher 
circles right from center of spiral and line follows, passing out in 
a reverse spiral; this is done first grasping hands and later without. 
(3) When leader reaches center of spiral, tightly wound, she 
signals to players in some direction and they lift arms, forming 
arches, under which the line may pass, teacher leading; hands are 
kept grasped in this case. 
I Say Stoop. 
A leader stands before the class and says, ‘“‘I say stoop,” at the 
same time stooping and rising, as in making a deep curtsy. All 
the players must stoop also, but if the leader says, “I say stand,” 
they must remain standing. When the leader sees any player 
stoop at the wrong time he calls that player to the front and that 
one becomes leader. As the players become used to it the play is 
carried on more rapidly. 
Do This, Do That. 
Like “I Say Stoop,” with greater variety. The leader makes
-P-A-G-E-15
  PLAYS OF SIMPLE IMITATION 3 
a movement, at the same time saying ‘‘Do this” or “Do that.” If 
he says “Do this,” all the players must imitate, but if he says ““Do 
that” they must stand still. Any gymnastic movement or other 
suitable exercise may be used. When the leader sees anyone 
make a mistake he calls that one up to be leader. 
Ducks Fly. 
Similar to “Do This,” but more difficult. For example, the 
leader may say “Boys run” and run in place, when all must imitate; 
but if he should say ‘‘Fish run” or “Fences run” they should not 
imitate. Many exercises may be used, such as walk, jump, stoop, 
swim, fly, hop, throw, catch, bat, whirl, etc. Whenever the leader 
sees any player fail to imitate when he should or imitate when 
he should not, he may call that one to be leader in his place. 
Circle Ball. 
Players in a circle, standing about three feet apart. Have them 
pass a ball or beanbag around the circle. When they are good at 
regular passing, have them pass irregularly or across in any direc- 
tion. Sometimes, but not always, have those who miss go out of 
the game. Encourage alertness and quickness to see the ball and 
catch it. 
School Ball. 
_ Pupils standing in a circle. The leader tosses a ball or beanbag 
to different players, who immediately return it to the leader. At 
first any form of throw may be used; later the ball may be returned 
by the kind of throw the leader uses. Carelessness may be cor- 
rected by having those who miss leave the play, but this is not 
best unless purposely done. It is a miss to drop the ball or to 
throw it beyond the reach of the leader. Encourage quick and 
unexpected throws. 
Toss Ball. 
Players seated. Teacher or leader has a beanbag or a rather 
large and light ball. Leader tosses the ball quickly to any player, 
and that one must rise and catch it and throw it back. If he 
misses it or fails to rise before it reaches him he has one point 
counted against him. Success depends on quick and accurate work 
by the leader and showing no partiality in choosing players. 
Double Pass. 
Like “Circle Ball” except that a leader is placed in the center of 
2 2 
 
-P-A-G-E-16
      4- THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
the circle and directs the play. The leader passes the ball or bag 
to any player; that player passes it to any other player; the second 
player must pass it back to the leader. After a dozen plays or 
so the teacher asks the leader to choose another leader and the 
previous leader goes in the line. Encourage alertness and accurate 
tossing and catching. 
Object Passing. 
Players in a circle. This is like ‘Circle Ball,” except that two 
or three balls, preferably of different sizes and weights, are passed 
rapidly from player to player; objects other than balls can also 
be used: beanbags, dumb-bells, erasers, Indian clubs, wands, mitts, 
masks, tennis rackets, etc. Later the objects may be passed in 
specified ways, as with one hand, over the shoulder, under one 
arm; or each player may be required to toss and catch each object 
before passing it, place it on the floor for the next player to get, 
toss it to him over the head, etc. 
Ball Drill. 
Players grouped by twos or threes, each group having a ball or 
beanbag. The players of each group pass the ball among them- 
selves in a manner stated by the teacher, but all in unison. See 
which groups can do it most times without dropping the ball. Vari- 
ous styles of pass can be used and players may be placed at any suit- 
able distance apart. Examples: Toss up with right hand and catch 
with both; toss with left and catch with both; catch also with right 
or left; throw forward from overhead; toss backward over the 
head; throw backward under left arm, etc. Players will suggest 
other good variations. Some pupils will prefer to play this while 
the larger group plays some other game. 
Teacher and Class. 
Similar to ‘School Ball.” A leader is chosen for each group of 
eight or ten players, the players in a line and the leader eight or 
ten feet away at the side. A row in the schoolroom may be taken 
as a group, with a leader standing in front. The leader tosses the 
ball or beanbag to the players in turn, beginning at the head. 
Any player missing goes to the foot. If the leader misses he 
goes to the foot and the one at the head becomes leader. If the 
ball goes twice around and the leader does not miss, he goes in 
the line just above those who have missed and the head player 
becomes leader.
-P-A-G-E-17
PLAYS OF SIMPLE IMITATION 5 
Twirling. 
There should be a leader for each group of six to ten players. 
The leader grasps each player in turn by the arm and gives him 
a pull and a whirling motion, vigorous enough to make him turn 
around once or twice but not enough to cause a fall. On gaining 
his balance the player must stop in the first position assumed, and 
stay in that position until all are “twirled.” Before doing this 
the leader tells. them how they must try to look; as, sad, merry, 
dignified, cross, etc. When all are in position the leader inspects 
the positions and expressions and chooses the one who does best 
for the next leader.

  CHAPTER Il 
STORY, PLAYS 
Story plays are incomplete dramatizations, omitting all the story 
except certain forms of vigorous physical movement. They are 
especially suited to short periods of exercise given for relief. The 
dramatic feature, which gives the interest, is entirely lost unless 
the pupils are familiar enough with the activities and the situations 
involved so that they can imagine and make believe. This makes 
it undesirable to have teachers memorize or take large numbers 
of story plays from books. It is much better to show teachers the 
idea and how to make story plays, and then have each teacher 
plan such as will fit well into the activities and interests of 
the pupils. 
In order to keep in touch with the pupil’s interests, story plays 
should be largely seasonal, but not wholly so. There are some 
interests, like that they have in the traffic officer, the fireman, the 
blacksmith, and the Indians, and also in such activities as moving, 
swimming, playing horse, washing, ironing, and delivering goods, 
which are the same the year round: but the larger number, like 
harvesting, coasting, snow play, picking fruit and flowers, making 
hay and ice cream have a distinctly seasonal interest for the child. 
Students should study and teach the following and in that way 
learn how to plan others, 
1. The Playground. 
1. Run across street to playground. (Two rows around one 
row of desks.) (Children may roll hoops as they run.)

  CHAPTER III 
RHYTHMIC PLAYS 
  Rhythmic plays are usually grouped into song plays and folk 
dances. The song plays are simpler and the musical accompaniment 
for the action is provided by singing. The folk dances require a 
musical instrument; a piano is best, but a victrola is often used. 
Two of the best known song plays are given below in full, fol- 
lowed by a list of those most popular. 
DID YOU EVER SEE A LASSIE? 
aS Say 
Citi Pipi ype i eS 
Sa The children march around the room in a circle while singing 
the first two lines of song. Stop facing center. On first “Do this 
way and that,” one child who stands in the center imitates some 
activity. During the last two lines of song all children imitate 
leader. 
Did you ever see a lassie do this way and that? 
Did you ever see a lassie, a lassie, a lassie, 
Do this way and that way, do this way and that way, 
Did you ever see a lassie do this way and that?   
  
    
  
  
  
  
    
  
    
  
  
Activities suggested. Bowing, alternating to right and left; 
swinging folded arms in front of the body as if rocking a doll; 
motion as if waving a flag; rocking-horse, one foot a short step 
forward, hands holding reins, sway forward and back changing the 
weight from one foot to the other, etc.; encourage original sugges- 
tions from the children. 
Note: ‘“Laddie” is sung if a boy is leader.

One child is chosen to be the “farmer” and stands in the center 
of the ring, while the rest join hands and circle around him singing, 
The farmer in the dell, the farmer in the dell, 
Heigh oh, for Rowley O! The farmer in the dell. 
The first child chooses and leads to the center of the circle a second 
one; the second chooses a third, and so on, while the rest sing the 
following verses: 
The farmer takes a wife— 
The wife takes the child— 
The child takes the nurse— 
The nurse takes the dog— 
The dog takes the cat— 
The cat takes the rat— 
The rat takes the cheese—

  CHAPTER IV 
CONTESTS BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS 
Contests are simple comparisons of ability in special lines. We 
may have contests in all lines of physical activity, but certain ac- 
tivities or “events” have proved themselves to be most satisfactory. 
This standard list of events includes track and field, aquatic events, 
golf, bowling and archery. 
The track events include the sprints, the hurdle races, and the 
middle distance and long distance runs; the field events include 
jumping and throwing weights. The sprints are the races in which 
the runner goes at utmost speed. The hurdle races are obstacle 
races. The long distance runs call for endurance as well as speed. 
The aquatic events include swimming and diving. 
TRACK EVENTS 
Sprints 100-yard dash S 
220-yard dash 
Elurdles 120-yard high hurdle 
220-yard low hurdle 
Track Events 
Middle distance runs hale mile

The Sprints. | 
There are two of these: the 100 and the 220 yard runs. Here | 
the men run in lanes four feet wide, made by marking the ground 
with lines or by attaching cord to stakes 18 inches high. A straight 
mark is made for the starting place, and another at the finish. The 
runners draw numbers to determine their positions in starting. 
Most sprinters nowadays use what is called the crouching start. 
A small hole is dug for the toes of each foot, one about 18 inches 
in front of the other; the tips of the fingers rest on the ground at |

  22 THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
the starting line. The starter calls, “On your marks!” at which the 
runners take their places at the starting line. He then calls “Set!” 
at which each gets ready for his start. As soon as all are ready 
he fires the pistol as the signal to go. If any runner starts before 
the pistol, all are called back, the one offending is put back a cer- 
tain distance, and the three stages of the start are repeated. A 
light cord or yarn is stretched at\the finish, and three judges and 
two or more timekeepers are stationed there. The judges are to 
pick the first, second, and third contestants to reach the tape; 
sometimes the best four or even five are picked, requiring more 
judges. Each timer has a stop-watch, which he sets going at the 
flash of the pistol; when the first runner strikes the cord at the 
finish he stops the watch, which should then record the exact time 
of the race. The best time ever made in the 100-yard dash is 
9-3/5 seconds*; in the 220, 21-1/5 seconds. 
In races for children and in some cases where there is not room 
for a straight track of 100 yards, shorter sprints are used. Sprints 
of 60 and 50 yards are satisfactory, but when the course is shorter 
than this it is difficult to judge and time the races, the runners finish 
so near together.t 
The Hurdle Races. 
There are two of these: one of 120 yards, with 10 hurdles 3%4 
feet high; and one of 220 yards, with 1o hurdles 2% feet high. 
The 10 hurdles divide the course into 11 parts: in the 120-yard race 
the two end sections are 15 yards each and the hurdles 10 yards 
apart; in the 220 the course has 11 equal portions, each 20 yards. 
The start is made as in a sprint race, each runner having a course 
which the others must not cross nor encroach upon. The finish is 
judged and timed as in other races. Two hurdles may be knocked 
over without forfeiting the race, but a record cannot be made unless 
all the hurdles are left standing. The -high hurdles are too high 
for high school boys to use. The record for the 120-yard high 
hurdle race is 14-2/5 seconds; for the 220-yard low hurdle race, 
23-3/5 seconds. 
On indoor tracks shorter hurdle races are used, sometimes 40 
yards with 3 hurdles. Hurdle races as long as 440 yards are 
sometimes run, with 10 hurdles 35 yards apart. 
The Distance Runs. 
These are the quarter, the half, called the middle distance runs, 
  
*Records up to May 1, 1922. 
+ Olympic games are from roo meters up.
-P-A-G-E-35
  CONTESTS BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS 23 
and the mile, with several longer distances from which a choice is 
usually agreed upon. The longer the race the less need there is 
to use the crouching start. In all these races the methods of con- 
ducting the start and finish are the same as in the sprints; but the 
runners are not restricted to a fixed course, and one may cross or 
go in front of another as soon as he is two strides in advance. The 
best time ever made in the quarter mile is 47-2/5 seconds; in the 
half mile, 1 minute, 10-4/5 seconds; in the mile, 4 minutes, 12-3/5 
seconds. 
FIELD EVENTS

The Jumps. 
The regular jumps are the running broad jump, the running high 
jump, and the pole vault. 
In the running broad jump the contestants may run as far as 
they please, but all must jump from a plank set in the ground, with 
the earth away from the front to a depth of 3 inches, and called 
the “Take off.” 
If one steps over the plank so as to break grouna in front of 
it, the jump is not measured, but it counts as a trial. The jump is 
measured with a tape from the front of the plank to the nearest 
point at which the jumper breaks ground, whether with feet, hands, 
or body. Each contestant has three trials, and then the best three 
are usually given three more if they desire, each man’s best jump 
being taken. The longest jump on record is 25 feet 3 inches. 
For indoor use this rule may be modified to measure from the 
place the jumper takes off. 
In the running high jump each contestant must clear the bar with- 
out displacing it from its supports. The bar is placed at first at 
a height that all can clear; each has three trials if necessary; then 
the bar is raised. Whoever fails to clear it at any height in three 
trials drops out, and the successful ones try at greater heights until 
only one remains. Going over the bar head first, by a movement 
called a “dive,” is not permitted; neither can anyone assist the 
 
-P-A-G-E-36
  24 THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
jumper to alight. The record for the high jump is 6 feet 7-5/16 
inches. 
The pole vault is conducted like the high jump. The contestants 
must not climb the pole; and they must clear the bar without dis- 
placing it. The record for the pole vault is 13 feet 5 inches. 
Throwing Weights. 
This includes putting the shot, throwing the javelin, and throw- 
ing the discus. 
The shot is a round iron ball, 8 pounds or 12 pounds in weight for 
high school, and 16 pounds for college contests. The contestants put 
the shot from a circle 7 feet in diameter; one may not step from 
the circle except from the rear half until the distance is measured; 
it is measured from the nearest side of the circle to the place where 
the shot first strikes the ground. Each contestant has three trials, 
then the four best have three more. Record for the 16 pound 
shot, 51 feet. 
The javelin has a wooden shaft and a sharp iron point. It is 
814 feet long and weighs 1-6/10 pounds. It is thrown from behind 
a scratch line after a short run. The thrower must not cross the 
line until the distance has been measured. 
The discus is a flat disk of metal weighing 414 pounds. It is 
thrown from a circle 8 feet 2% inches in diameter, subject to 
practically the same rules as the shot, excepting that a turn of the 
body and a swing of the arm is used. Record discus throw, 156 
feet 1-3/8 inches. 
Other Events Often Used. 
Besides the above list, which is the one most often followed, 
there are a number of other events of considerable interest and 
value, among them being the following: 
The cross-country race is usually over a course from two to 
five miles in length. This sport is popular among schools in the 
fall of the year. For competition, teams of five men are selected. 
The men are scored by number according to their order in finishing, 
and the team with the lowest total wins. 
The Marathon race is a run of approximately 25 miles. It 
is too severe for all except mature men with unusual physique and 
intense training. 
The standing high and standing broad jumps are often used 
indoors.
-P-A-G-E-37
  CONTESTS BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS 25 
The hop, step and jump, the hitch kick and the high dive are 
sometimes used to increase the variety. 
Throwing the 12 to 16 pound hammer and the 56-pound weight 
were used extensively many years ago, but are little used now. 
The pentathlon is a group of five events, a hexathlon of six, 
and a decathlon of ten, to be performed by the same contestants. 
A track meet also includes in most cases a relay race. The 
standard team and distances are described at the end of the chapter 
on Group Contests. 
Any of the tests of physical ability that have been described under 
that heading can just as readily be used in contest form. Some of 
them, which are fundamentals of games, are used by coaches to 
incite rivalry and a desire for improvement on the part of the 
squad. Some of these fundamental features are the baseball 
throw, both for accuracy and distance; football kicking—punting, 
drop kicking and place kicking—for accuracy and distance; football 
passing, for distance; the soccer throw and kick for distance; and 
basket ball throwing—for accuracy, as in the case of foul shooting 
and in counting successful tries from shots on certain areas of the 
floor; for speed, to see how many goals can be made in a minute; 
and for distance, using the two-handed overhead throw, a type 
of event that has proven very popular with younger boys and girls 
on the playground. 
Some of the activities commonly looked upon as recreative sports, 
like skiing, skating, and rifle shooting, are often used in contests 
at carnivals. 
Track Meets. 
Track athletics are usually stimulated through tournaments or 
“meets” between schools and between classes in the same school. 
In preparation for a meet between two or more schools, the ground 
for the different contests should be prepared beforehand, all ap- 
paratus being provided and everything made ready. Courses for 
the runs should be measured accurately and smoothed; the plank 
set in place for the broad jump; ground spaded up for the high 
jump and the pole vault; circles drawn for the weight throwing; 
hurdles made. Several competent and impartial officials should be 
provided, as follows: the referee is the highest official; he has gen- 
eral charge of the meet and decides all questions, including the 
order of events; the clerk of the course notifies the contestants 
when to appear for their contests; the starter starts all the runs; 
judges decide the winners and the time keepers take the time; the
-P-A-G-E-38
  26 THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
scorer keeps the scores as they are made; and the announcer calls 
the scores so that the spectators may hear. A physician should be 
in attendance, in case of injury. Rules are published that have been 
agreed to by the national associations, with directions for all details 
of the meet. 
AQUATIC EVENTS 
Free style 
Breast stroke 
evans Back stroke 
Aquatic Events Crawl 
ivi Plunge for distance Diving lean diving 
The length of swimming races varies with the length of the 
pool used. Contests in other special forms of stroke and in life 
saving activities are also frequently included. 
Contestants in swimming start from the floor at the end of the 
pool and the starter uses the same signals as in running events. 
There is an exception in case of the back stroke, the swimmers 
starting in this case in the water, facing the starting line, with both 
hands on the curb of the pool, but the same signals are used. 
Archery 
Shooting at a target with bow and arrow has been, at certain 
periods of history, the most popular sport in the world. The 
targets are round, 4 feet in diameter, standing on an easel. Each 
has 5 concentric rings, and shots count 9, 7, 5, 3, or I, according 
to the ring pierced. The contestants usually have 3 shots at the 
target at a trial, and eight or ten rounds are shot, each round 
including a trial by each contestant. In tournaments there are 
usually 3 rounds at different distances, often at 60, 50, and 40 yards. 
Bowling 
Bowling is at present a very popular form of exercise. Large 
wooden balls are rolled along a smooth alley built of wood with 
the object of knocking down a group of ten wooden pins standing 
at the further end. The players take turns, each being allowed to 
bowl two balls unless he knocks down all the pins with one. One 
score is made for each pin knocked down, and an additional score
-P-A-G-E-39
  
CONTESTS BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS 27 
is given as follows: If all the pins are knocked down by the first 
ball, it is called a “‘strike,’”’ and the score made with the first two 
balls in the next turn is added to the first score as well as being 
counted in the second. If all the pins are knocked down with the 
first two balls, it is called a ‘‘spare,” and the score made with the 
first ball of the next turn is added to the preceding turn as well as be- 
ing counted in its own place. Each player begins each turn with his 
pins all up and the alley clear of balls. Ten rounds make a “frame.” 
If in a certain frame player A.B. scored in his ten rounds 6, strike, 
spare, 7, spare, 6, strike, spare, 9, and 8, while his opponent, C.D., 
scored 9, 8, strike, spare, 8, strike, spare, spare, 4, and 7, the 
scoreboard would be filled out as follows. It will be noticed that 
only the totals are entered, so that the score written in each space 
is the total score up to that time. KX means a strike; /, a spare. A 
spare in the tenth round gives a player another throw; a strike, 
two more throws.

  Golf 
Golf is a Scotch play that has become very popular, especially 
as a recreation for mature men and women. It is not universally 
played because of the expense of membership in golf clubs and the 
cost of a complete playing outfit. A full course of eighteen holes 
requires a space of about one hundred acres, preferably of rolling 
ground. A nine-hole course would require half the space. In 
this case for a full “game” one must play twice around. 
The course is called a “golf links,” and consists of eighteen differ- 
ent links or, as they are generally called, holes. Each hole consists, 
first, of a “tee” of well-clipped turf, level and from ten to twenty 
feet square, as a starting point. Second, a ‘“‘fair green,” 150 to 
200 feet wide of well-mowed meadow land, stretching away to the 
flag at the hole which marks the end of that link. There are 
usually some “hazards” along the sides and sometimes across the 
fairway, either natural hazards, as trees, brooks or ponds, or 
artificial hazards, as “bunkers” (a mound of earth) or sand traps, 
to catch poorly played balls. Third, a ‘“‘putting green” from sixty 
to seventy feet square, of closely clipped turf, level or slightly
-P-A-G-E-40
  28 THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
undulating. Near the center of this putting green is a four-inch 
cup set in level with the ground. In the center of the cup is a 
slender standard a few feet high with a flag at the top to indicate 
to the player the exact location of the hole he is playing for. 
The links or holes vary in length from 75 yards to 600 yards. 
The average length is from 300 to 400 yards. The distance around 
the course of eighteen holes is from 6,000 to 6,400 yards, or a 
little more than three miles and a half. 
Several golf sticks or clubs are necessary in order to play a good 
game. The most important of these are as follows: a driver, a 
brassy, a mid-iron, a mashie, a niblick and a putter. The driver 
and the brassy are clubs with wooden heads and are used for dis- 
tances of 160 to 225 yards. The other clubs have iron heads and 
have more loft or pitch to them progressively, except the putter, 
which has nearly a straight face. The mid-iron is used for 
distances of 130 to 160 yards, the mashie for pitching balls 75 
to 125 yards, the niblick for getting out of sandpits or bunkers or 
high grass, or for pitching balls high from distances of 25 to 
75 yards, and dropping them on the putting green near the flag. 
The putter is used only on the putting green to drive the ball into 
the cup. The club used depends on the distance desired and on 
the position of the ball, whether it lies well or poorly on the turf. 
The ball used is a white, hard rubber ball, one and three-quarter 
inches in diameter. 
The object of play is to drive this ball around the links, in 
competition with another player, who plays his own ball, in the 
fewest strokes possible. In ‘‘medal play” the one who secures the 
lowest number of strokes is the winner; in “match play” the one 
who wins the majority of holes is first. Each link or hole is 
played as a unit from the tee to the cup. When the ball has been 
“holed,” that is, driven into the cup, it is lifted by the hand and 
the player goes a few rods away to the tee of the next link or hole 
of the course, and so on until he has completed the full eighteen 
holes. This ends the game unless there is a tie. In match play, 
in case of a tie, the players start around the courses again and play 
until one of the competitors wins a hole; in medal play, to break a 
tie, it is usual to play at least nine more holes. 
The term “bogey” means the number of strokes in which a 
good player should go round the course; for the average links from 
78 to 80 strokes. ‘Par’? means the number of strokes that an 
extra-good player should use in playing around, 73 to 77 strokes

being about right for the average course. The term “‘singles’’ is 
applied to a game in which there is only one player on each side. 
A “foursome” is a match in which there are four players, two on 
each side, each playing his own ball. A ‘“two-ball foursome” is a 
match in which there are two players on each side, the partners 
using but one ball and playing the strokes alternately. 
Because it keeps one out of doors, is vigorous without being 
violent, exercises every muscle of the body and requires great skill 
in the control of the various strokes, golf is the best all-life contest 
yet devised. 
MINOR CONTESTS 
Beanbag Target Contests. 
Draw on the floor three concentric circles with radius 1, 2 and 
3 feet and number these circles 5, 3, 1 from within outward. 
Players stand at a line 15 to 20 feet away and toss 3 beanbags at 
the target. When one has made his 3 throws a judge records the 
score made from the positions of the bags: each lying entirely 
within the inner circle counts 5, next circle 3, outer 1. A bag lying 
on a circle scores for the outer space. As soon as the judge has 
recorded the score, the next player takes the bags and throws in 
the same way. With a large group several targets may be used 
at once, with a judge or scorer at each target. A target may be 
drawn on the wall instead of on the floor; a board with holes in it 
is sometimes used.

30 THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
clubs in each circle, and make as many crosses on the floor in line 
with each circle, crosses 3 to 10 feet apart, according to the size 
of the room, but all distances alike. A pupil stands by each circle. 
At the word “Go!” each takes a club and sets it up on one of his 
crosses, returns and gets another, and so on, taking the clubs singly, 
until all are set up. A second set of pupils can have a similar race 
now without any rearrangement by having the runners take the clubs 
from the crosses and stand them up in the circles. A third set 
may have a contest like the first, and a fourth like the second, and 
so on until all have run. 
: The following simple contests have been devised for use with 
grades of pupils in the schoolroom or gymnasium: 
Racing. 
Have two or more players race from seats or class positions 
around a course or to a point and back to starting place. Be sure 
all have a fair chance to win. Repeat until all have taken a turn. 
Example: from front seat to front wall and return. 
Crossing the Brook. 
. Draw two lines on floor for the banks of the brook. It should 
be wider at one end than at the other. If there are many players, 
make two or more such places. The players form in line and take a 
running jump across the brook. Those who step in the brook must 
drop out of line to dry their feet. Those who are successful in the 
jump continue around a course and jump again. Have them try 
to jump at a wider place than at first. Standing jump may be 
also used. 
Meet at the Switch. 
Teacher stands in front of the room, a beanbag in each hand. 
Two players stand ready and at a signal each takes one of the bags 
from.the teacher’s hands and they run around the room in opposite 
directions, passing at the rear of the room like cars on the switch, 
each turning to right. The one returning the bag to the teacher 
first wins. This can be made a group contest by having two teams, 
counting a score for each winner, and seeing which side gets more 
scores. 
Fire Engine. 
Divide the class in five or six groups. Each group has a number. 
The fire alarm may be sounded by clapping hands or blowing a
-P-A-G-E-43
  CONTESTS BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS BL 
whistle. When alarm sounds the number indicated runs to the fire, 
i.e., goes to a certain goal and back. At a general alarm (which 
may be one clap or one whistle) all drop hands and race to goal. 
The one winning sounds the fire alarm next time. This may also 
be played in the schoolroom, having each row a fire company. 
Schoolroom Bowling. 
Stand 1, 3 or 6 Indian clubs, erasers, or sticks sawed from a 
curtain pole in a triangular pattern, which can best be kept uniform 
by making marks on the floor with chalk. Fifteen to 20 feet away 
mark a place for the bowler to stand. The apex of the group of 
clubs should be toward the bowler, as in tenpins. Players bowl 
in turn one ball at the clubs, and the number knocked down is 
scored to their credit. Have as many alleys as space permits, one 
for each aisle if possible. Players who have bowled must hasten 
to set up clubs to save delay and make it possible to have an- 
other turn. 
Opposing groups may bowl in alternation and keep only the 
score for the group. Tennis balls or other rubber balls may be used. 
Wand Race. 
Players in several teams of equal numbers. Draw a starting 
line and a finishing line at opposite sides of the playing space. One 
player of each team stands at the starting line with a wand or 
stick balanced on his right forefinger. The stick may be held in 
balance by the other hand until the starting signal is given, and 
then the players start forward balancing the stick. If it drops off 
it must be replaced at the point where it fell before advancing 
farther. The one who reaches the finishing line first, having 
balanced the stick all the way, wins the race. o

  CHAPTER V 
CONTESTS BETWEEN GROUPS 
Contests between groups have the advantage of arousing keen 
interest among players of less ability as well as among the best few. 
There are three plans or methods of handling group contests: 
1. Mass Competition. Here each group takes part as a whole, 
as in tug-of-war or push ball. 
2. Players compete individually, counting scores for the group 
to which the winners belong. The usual plan is to have two or 
more groups represented in each contest, pick the three individual 
contestants doing best and count scores for the groups—five for the 
first place, three for the second and one for the third. Contests in 
which a score is kept, as in archery, bowling and golf, are well 
adapted to this kind of group competition, since adding the scores 
of the individual players gives the group score. 
3. Relay Races. Here all the players of a group take part in 
turn, each starting as the preceding player finishes. Relays are 
especially adapted to running and swimming. 
: I. MASS COMPETITION 
Tug-of-War. 
A long rope is stretched out on a level surface; the members of 
one team grasp one end and those of the other team the other. A 
handkerchief is tied about the rope to mark its middle, and two 
lines are marked on the ground 4 yards apart and at right angles to 
the rope. When all is ready the teams take positions so as to bring 
the middle of the rope midway between the two lines, and then the 
signal is given to pull. The side pulling the middle of the rope 
past the line first wins the contest, or the pull may be for a certain 
number of seconds. The distinguishing feature of this type of 
contest is that the group acts as a mass, no comparison of indi- 
vidual abilities being made. 
Other Mass Contests. 
Push-ball contests, between large groups of men in the army 
camps, and the cane-rush and flag-rush of former college days, 
32
-P-A-G-E-45
  CONTESTS BETWEEN GROUPS 33 
belong in this group. Rowing and paddling races where more 
than one man occupies a boat or canoe are also of this class. 
The following simple contests, of the same type, have been 
arranged for use in schoolroom, gymnasium or playground: 
Group Racing. 
Players in a row of seats form a group. Two rows race to find 
which can run entirely around own row and be seated again. The 
winners of two such races compete in same way, thus finally finding 
champion row for the day. In every race each player must go 
clear around the row of seats to which he belongs, seating himself 
from the side where he arose. 
Chariot Race. 
Four players with joined hands make a team. Teams race 
between convenient points. If the course is around.a circle the 
best runners should be placed so as to have the outside, where 
distance is greatest. Teams may race two and two and then 
winners race. 
Advancing Statues. 
Divide players into two equal groups. Place the groups on 
opposite sides of the playing space, with a leader between. Ex- 
plain that each player is to be a live player when the leader is not 
looking at him, but must be an immovable statue whenever the 
leader looks that way. Players advance toward the leader when 
he is looking another way, and he sends anyone back to the edge 
of play space if he sees him moving. The side which first reaches 
the center of the play space wins the contest. 
Il. RACING AND COUNTING SCORES 
Make a scoreboard on the blackboard, indicating each row by 
a number or letter. Have front players run, tag front wall, return 
to seats, and sit erect; mark a score for the row whose player 
wins. Then have second players run; mark score; others in a 
similar manner. Repeat, runners tagging near wall. See which 
row has largest score. 
When conditions are favorable, pupils not running may be 
selected as judges and the races scored on the plan used in colleges, 
giving the winner of first place 5, second place 3, and third place 
I point.
-P-A-G-E-46
  34 THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
Ill. RELAY RACES 
In relay races it often happens that one or more players violate 
the rules. To penalize each case of this kind by forfeiting the race 
is not satisfactory, since it penalizes the whole group too severely. 
A good plan in this case is to call each infringement of the rules a 
foul: add to the place of finish in the race the number of fouls; then 
award the race to the team with smallest total. When there are 
no fouls, or an equal number, the team finishing first wins. 
Shuttle Relays 
Tag the Wall Relay. 
Players in their seats. Two or more rows compete. The player 
in the back seat rises at a signal from the teacher, runs forward 
down the aisle, tags the wall at the front of the room, and returns 
to his seat. As soon as he has reached his seat the player next 
in front of him does the same, the relay being complete when 
each player in turn has run. The line whose front player is seated 
first wins. 
Flag Race. 
Players seated at desks. Rows need not be full, but there must 
be same number in each row. Choose a player to stand in front 
‘of each row to hold the flag, and another to stand at the rear of 
each row. At the signal the rear player of each row rises, runs 
to the front, takes the flag from the one holding it, carries it to 
the one standing at the rear, and returns to his seat. As soon as 
he is seated the next player goes and takes the flag back to the 
player in front. This continues till all have run. Be sure that 
no team has an unfair advantage because of the positions taken 
by the flag holders. 
The two relay races just described illustrate what is called 
the “Shuttle” form of relay, the players of a group running back 
and forth like the movement of a shuttle. The next one illustrates 
a shuttle relay adapted to an open space rather than a schoolroom. 
Sending Messages Down the Trench. 
The teams are lined up on one line, and at another parallel line 
about 20 feet distant station a player who has been given a 
written message. At the given signal the messenger reads the 
message silently, runs down to his team, takes the first player and
-P-A-G-E-47
  CONTESTS BETWEEN GROUPS 33 
runs with him back to his goal line, whispering the message as he 
goes. Player No. 2 then returns to the next player in line and takes 
him across, again whispering the message. The game continues 
until the last player in line has the message. The team succeeding 
in having its final player repeat the message, and finish in the 
quickest time, wins the race. 
Blackboard Relay. 
The competing rows must be placed where there is a blackboard 
at the front or rear. Played much like “Tag the Wall.” First 
player of each line has a piece of chalk. At the signal he runs to 
the board and makes a mark with the chalk, then returns and hands 
chalk to next player, who runs and marks in his turn. Later 
players may be required to make a cross, square, circle, capital 
letter, small letter, comma, dash, question mark, etc. The teacher 
is the judge as to whether these marks come up to the requirements, 
and each team is charged with a foul for every such defect. 
Blackboard Relay, Second. 
This is like the blackboard relay just described, but instead 
of marks and letters, words must be written; these may be required 
to form a sentence, numbers may be written and afterwards added, 
subtracted, etc.,@y the succeeding players, or each player may 
write his own name. It is often interesting to have the last player 
required to erase all his team has written, or each child may erase 
his own writing, passing the eraser as he did the chalk. 
Variations in Shuttle Relays. 
In place of writing on a blackboard, the runner may be required 
to take a gymnastic exercise, go over or under an obstacle, perform 
a stunt, move a chair or other object from one place to another, etc. 
The shuttle form of relay may be varied in an endless variety 
of ways by requiring each runner to stop and do something at 
some point of the run. The last two will illustrate this for the 
schoolroom. 
Another and slightly different way to vary the run is to change 
to some other form of locomotion. Each player may be required 
to hop, skip, walk, run backward, go on all fours, etc., for either 
part or all of the way. The shuttle relay is also suited to races in 
the swimming pool.

-P-A-G-E-48
  36 THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
Race Track Relays 
Relay races in running, walking, hopping, etc., can also be done 
in the so-called “‘Race-track”’ form, the course going around the 
room, or around one or two rows of seats, or around two, three or 
four chairs or jump standards placed in suitable positions. The 
next races illustrate this form, which has the advantage that 
players are not encouraged to start too soon, since they gain by 
doing so in a shuttle relay but not in a race-track relay. 
Automobiles. 
The first child in each alternate row, at a signal given by the 
teacher, leaves by the right side, runs forward around his seat and 
then to the rear on the left side, completely encircling his own row 
of seats. As soon as he is seated, the next child behind him runs 
in the same manner, and this continues until the last child has 
run and has returned to his seat. The other rows then play in the 
same way, and finally the winning rows. At the beginning, the cap- 
tain for each row names the automobile it represents. 
Telegram. 
Players in two equal teams, lined up on opposite sides of the 
room facing the center, The odd player (or the teacher when 
there is no odd player) stands in front of the room, adits middle, 
with a telegram in each hand. Mark a startgg line for each 
team near the wall and equally distant from the sender. On signal 
the first player of each team runs and takes the telegram from the 
sender, runs up the first aisle of his half of the room and down the 
next one and then across to the next player of his side who is wait- 
ing at the starting line, hands him the telegram, and goes to the foot 
of his line. The second player as soon as he receives the telegram 
runs out, up and down the same aisles, and hands it to the next, and 
soon. The last player rounds the two aisles and takes the telegram 
back to the sender. 
Relays in Handling Objects 
While the plan of conducting group contests by the relay method 
is especially suited to running, it is also fairly well adapted to group 
contests in handling objects. Several contests of this kind are 
described next. 
Corner Spry. 
Place a group in each of the four corners, N., S., E.. W. Four
-P-A-G-E-49
CONTESTS BETWEEN GROUPS By, 
captains stand in the center facing their groups, each having a 
ball or beanbag. At the signal each captain tosses the bag to the 
first player of his group, who returns it to the captain. It is passed 
in this way to all the players, and when it reaches the last one the 
captain calls “Corner Spry,” at which the first player runs out 
and becomes captain, all the players move up one place, and the 
former captain takes the last place. Each player thus is captain 
in turn, and each tosses the bag to all the players before calling 
“Corner Spry.” The team whose original captain comes to the 
captain’s position and receives the ball first after all the rest have 
served wins the contest. 
Ten Trips. 
Players in groups of three, with the three in a straight line, 
ten to twenty feet apart. Each group has a ball. The center 
player has the ball, and at the signal he throws it to another of his 
group, who must throw it to the third, over the head of the first 
player; the third returns it to the one in the center. When he 
receives it the center player says, “One Trip,” and begins as before. 
The group completing ten trips first is given a score; the first to 
make ten scores wins the contest. 
Beanbag Sidewise. 
Place a beanbag on each desk of the row on one side of the room. 
If vacant places exist, move players to front or back so that all 
vacant seats are in one transverse row. When the signal is given 
each child in row having the bags passes his bag to the player 
across the aisle, and this continues rapidly until the bags are held 
by the players in last row. This may be repeated, passing in 
alternate directions, and keeping score to show how many times 
each transverse row wins. 
Bowling Relay. 
Mark places to set up one or three Indian clubs for each team 
represented. From 20 to 40 feet back from the clubs draw the 
starting line. The leader of each team holds a small ball. At the 
starting signal the ball is bowled and the first player tries to knock 
down all of the clubs at once. He immediately runs and gets the 
ball and carries it back to the second person on his team, who 
has moved up to the starting line. The game continues until one 
team has bowled down all their clubs. The first team to bowl
-P-A-G-E-50
38 THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
down the clubs receives a score. All the clubs are then set up and 
the game starts again. 
Overtake. 
Players in a large circle in a clear space. Number around the 
circle by ones and twos. ‘The ones play against the twos. One 
team should be marked by a paper pinned on, a handkerchief around 
arm, or some other way that will make players easily distinguished. 
Each team has a leader standing near the center of the circle, and 
each leader has a ball. At a signal from the teacher each leader 
tosses the ball to one of his team, who quickly tosses it back. It 
is tossed to each one of the team in turn and tossed back, going 
around the circle clockwise. Each team tries to overtake the 
other. The one finishing a round first is given a score. Repeat, 
going in opposite direction. Each leader may begin each time with 
any player of his side. The side first getting ten scores wins. 
Pass and Toss Relay. 
Two rows form a group or team. Each group must have same 
number. The two rows face each other. Front player of one line 
has a ball. When the teacher gives the signal to start, the ball is 
passed as rapidly as possible from player to player of that line. 
The last player tosses it across to the last player of the other line 
and immediately crosses over and stands beside that player. The 
ball is passed up the second line, the last player also crossing over 
after passing. Lines keep moving to make room for the players 
who cross. Continue till player who has ball at first gets it again 
after passing entirely around to his original place. Group first 
completing the relay wins. Ball must be handled by every player, 
or a foul should be called. 
Later two balls may be used, the second ball starting at rear 
end of second line at same time first ball leaves front end of first 
line. May be played in an open space, but in this case lines must 
be drawn on floor at front and rear of rows and end players must 
stand on these lines. 
Combination Relays 
Relays in handling objects are apt to lack sufficient vigorous 
exercise, and to improve upon this we have relays combining run- 
ning and handling objects. A combination relay suited to both the 
players and the place can usually be arranged as follows: (1)
-P-A-G-E-51
  CONTESTS BETWEEN GROUPS 39 
divide the group into teams; (2) draw a long line as a common 
starting line and place the teams behind it; (3) mark a course for 
each team to run by placing chairs or jumping standards at equal 
distances from the starting line; (4) choose a suitable stunt for the 
players to do; and (5) decide just how and where this stunt is to 
be performed. By an intelligent planning of the length of the 
course and the extent to which the running is delayed by handling 
objects, the exercise can be made just as vigorous as the teacher 
thinks best. The following are common examples of this kind of 
relay, of which hundreds have been devised and which are usually 
and improperly called games. 
Overhead Relay. 
Players standing in rows in an open space, same number in 
each row and end players of each row standing on a line on the 
floor, to give the rows equal length. Players face so as to stand 
one behind another. Front player of each row has a ball. At 
a signal the ball is passed back over the heads of the players; the 
rear player runs forward on right side of his row, takes his place 
at the front, and at once begins the same play. This continues until 
the player who was in front at first comes to the same place 
again and holds the ball up. The row doing this first wins. It is a 
foul if any player fails to handle the ball in his turn, if any player 
who drops the ball does not himself get it and pass it on from his 
place in the row, or if end players do not stand on the floor lines. 
Eraser Relay. 
Place an eraser on the front desk in each row.. At a signal to 
start, the first child in each row takes the eraser with both hands 
and passes it over his head to the child behind him. This continues 
till the last child receives it. The last child runs forward with it 
on right side of his row and places it on the rack at front of room; 
then returns to his seat by same path. Give each child a turn in 
the back seat. 
Fetch and Carry. 
Draw a circle 18 inches in diameter in front of each row of 
seats close to the front wall. Give each pupil a beanbag. At the 
signal each front pupil runs forward, places his bag in the circle, and 
resumes his seat. His being seated is the signal for the next to do 
the same, and so on till all the bags are in the circles. The first 
to finish is given a score, provided every bag is in the circle.
-P-A-G-E-52
  40 THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
Now the play is reversed. At the signal the last player goes 
and gets his beanbag and after he is seated he touches the one in 
front of him asa signal to go. In this way all the bags are brought 
back to the seats and the winner given a score. The play may be 
continued for a stated time and the score counted, or the first to 
gain a certain score may be the winner. 
Over and Under Relay. 
Like “Overhead Relay,” except that two balls or other objects 
are passed, the first overhead and the second between the feet. 
The first player counts ten between the passing of the first and 
second objects; the last player runs to head of line after receiving 
both. It can be played in the schoolroom by having alternate rows 
play at same time, so as to leave a free aisle for running. 
Arch Goal Ball. 
Two baskets are placed on the floor or on hooks at,any convenient 
height. A throwing line is drawn 15 feet from each basket. 
Players in two teams, lined up behind the two throwing lines, 
facing the baskets. Each rear player has a basket ball. A small 
rubber ball or beanbag may be used. Set a length of time for 
play, 3 to § minutes. On signal the ball is passed forward with 
both hands over the heads of the players, until it reaches the front, 
when the front player throws for goal. Whether he makes a 
score or not, the thrower gets the ball, runs to the rear of his line, 
and the play is repeated. The side having the most scores when 
time is called wins. The play may be varied by having each player 
who tries for goal keep on trying until he makes it before going to 
the rear. 
Carrying a Wounded Soldier. 
Two players from each team form a chair with their hands. 
Player No. 3 sits on the chair. The two players carrying No. 3 
run to a distant goal line 20 or more feet away and drop the 
wounded man. Then the wounded man and the player on the 
right run back to the starting line, form a chair and carry an- 
other man down the line. This play continues with all teams until 
one team has carried all the players over the line. Each player 
has a chance to carry and to be carried, making two trips. 
Hurly-Burly Beanbag. 
Players seated, a beanbag on each desk front. At a signal each

front player takes bag and tosses it up and back over his head. 
The player behind him must clap his hands after bag is thrown 
and then catch it or pick it up and do the same with it. Rear 
player, on getting it, hops down aisle to front of room and there 
executes some movement previously agreed upon; while he is doing 
this all the other players move back one seat. When he has finished 
the movement the player from the rear takes the front seat and 
begins as at first. This continues until the player who was in the 
front seat reaches it again and puts the bag on the desk as in the 
beginning. The row doing this first wins. 
Potato Relay Race. 
Same as potato race of the Playground Badge Tests, but have 
teams lined up at starting line and run in relays. Each runner 
does half the test. Aisles may be used. 
Time Ball. 
Draw a line two feet from the front wall and one 10 to 15 feet 
from it across the rows of seats.. A leader for each line stands on 
the line near the wall with a ball in his hand. The play is similar 
to “Tag the Wall,” except that each player goes to the second 
line where it crosses his row of seats, and receives the ball tossed 
or thrown by the leader, returns it to the leader, and takes his seat. 
It is a foul to catch the ball when not at the line. Later particular 
kinds of throws or tosses may be specified, in which case it is also 
a foul to use the wrong throw. Fouls should be penalized as in 
other relay races. Five rounds are played and score kept. 
Basket Ball Pursuit Race. 
Players in two teams of equal number, lined up on opposite 
sides of the playing space. The running course is around the 
square formed by the teams, runners passing outside of both lines. 
Corners may be marked by a stake, chair or other object not 
easily moved. Players face center. Right hand player of each 
line has a basket ball. At the signal these two players start run- 
ning forward around the course, each trying to catch up with the 
other. On reaching the place where he started, each runner hands 
the ball to the next player of his team, who runs in his turn, and 
then goes to the foot of the line. The side finishing first wins. 
High School and College Relay Teams. 
In the more formal relays forming a part of school and college 
track meets, there are usually four men on a relay team.
-P-A-G-E-54
  42 THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
On indoor tracks it is usual for each man to run one or two laps 
of the track. On outdoor tracks several distances are used: for 
the short relays each man runs 60 or 80 yards, for the middle 
distance each man runs 100 or 220 yards, for the long distance 
each man runs 440 yards. A medley relay is also used, some of 
the men running short distances and others longer distances. 
In these more formal relays it is customary for the runners of 
each team to have a baton, often wound with ribbons of school 
color, and this is handed from one to another as they run in turn.

Il. TESTS OF POSTURE 
MicHIGAN STATE NorMAL CoLiece PuysicaL EDUCATION 
DEPARTMENT GENERAL PosTURE REQUIREMENTS   The following grades of posture are recognized: 
Grade A. Those who pass the Bancroft posture test and who 
maintain good posture through the class hour.
-P-A-G-E-57
    PHYSICAL TESTS 45 
Grade B. Those who pass the Bancroft test, but do not maintain 
good posture. 
Grade C. Those with slight defects of posture which they lack 
the strength or skill to correct at will, but whose curves are flexible 
rather than resistant. 
Grade D. Those with resistant faults of posture or marked 
foot defects. 
REQUIREMENTS 
Grade A. To maintain good posture through the term and 
thus develop the habit of correct posture. 
Grades Band C. To achieve Grade A as soon as possible. May 
be transferred to corrective class if not able to improve under the 
conditions of regular class work. 
Grade D. To practice special corrective exercises as long as 
necessary. 
It is planned to give the Bancroft posture test four times in 
the term of Swedish gymnastics. Do not miss it. 
The posture of students and improvements in posture will be 
considered in giving grades for the term’s work. 
All women who maintain Grade A through the term are credited 
with five points toward the requirements for the college N awarded 
for physical efficiency and 5 per cent is added on class standing. 
The percentage of each class who are in Grade A will be posted 
in the gymnasium, also a Good Posture Roll containing the names 
of all in Grade A. 
The Bancroft Posture Test 
The Bancroft posture test, named ‘The Triple Test” by the 
author, Miss Jessie Bancroft, is made as follows: 
I. Have the pupils stand in their best positions and, standing 
at the side, pick out those whose posture is correct and put them 
in a separate group, called group A; the others form group B. 
II. Have the pupils of Group A march for 4 or 5 minutes and 
observe their postures while marching; put those who fail to 
maintain good posture in group B. 
III. Give the pupils who are still in group A after the marching 
test a few simple gymnastic exercises, including the raising of the 
arms above the level of the shoulders; put in group B all those 
who do not maintain good posture while taking the exercises. 
The pupils who are still in group A, having passed all three
-P-A-G-E-58
    46 THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
tests, form the honor group, and are placed in a special group 
during all formal exercises. 
A percentage of the whole group is obtained by dividing the 
number in group A by the entire number of pupils. 
A poster giving the percentage of all the rooms of a school or 
to different groups will stimulate interest. 
Ill. THE PULSE RATE TEST OF 
PHYSICAL CONDITION 
I. Find the pupil’s normal pulse rate. 
UI. Have him ron in place for fifteen seconds. 
III. Find how soon the pulse recovers normal rate. 
Time Degree Physical Habits 
to Recover Grade of Fitness or Type 
Y% minute A Fine Athletic 
I minute B Good Active 
2 minutes Cc Fair Moderate 
3 minutes D Poor Sedentary 
Pulse slower after run: E Very Poor 
If the pulse is irregular after the run, drop one grade down 
the scale. 
Meaning of the Test. 
No single test of physical fitness can be infallible. This is one of 
the best for ages thirteen to sixteen and above. Any healthy child 
should pass high. Anyone can do it; only a watch is needed. It is 
based on the following facts: 
A strong and regular pulse and a prompt recovery to normal rate 
after an exercise usually go with first-class physical condition; slow 
recovery indicates lack of training in exercise. When the pulse 
slows down irregularly after exercise, or when it is slower than 
normal after exercise, general weakness or some disorder is to be 
suspected. The following directions must be followed exactly. 
How to Make the Test. 
’ The person to be tested must be well; it should be made just 
after a quiet period, such as a school session of an hour or more, 
because the pulse is quickened by exercise and the normal rate can- 
not then be found. For the same reason it cannot well be made 
just after a meal or a bath or during any considerable excitement.
-P-A-G-E-59
  PHYSICAL TESTS 47 
I. To Find the Normal Pulse Rate. 
While the subject is standing quietly, count the pulse for one 
minute, using the second hand of a watch; be exact. Repeat until 
the same result is found three times in succession. This repetition 
is to make sure of accurate counting and sure of quiet condition of 
the subject. If pulse shows marked irregularity or is faster than 
108 per minute, do not give the running test without advice from 
a physician. 
II. Running in Place. 
This is done to quicken the pulse, and should be done at the rate 
of three steps per second, forty-five steps in all, lifting each foot to 
half the height of the opposite knee. The examiner can easily say 
“faster,” “feet higher,” or any other correction needed while the 
subject runs. Notice carefully the time of stopping. 
III. To Find the Time of Recovery. 
Beginning exactly one-half minute after stopping the run, count 
the pulse for twenty seconds. Write down the result. Multiply 
later by three to give rate per minute. 
Beginning exactly one minute after the run stopped, count it 
again. 
Beginning exactly two minutes after the run stopped, count it 
again. 
If the pulse is not yet at normal rate, repeat at intervals of one 
minute until normal rate returns. 
Find the subject’s rating in the table above. 
Differences of two to four beats per minute may be disregarded. 
If a slower rate is found after the run, in a case where the 
subject is strong and well, repeat the test from the beginning, as it is 
likely that the rate found before exercise was for some reason too 
high and the normal is what is found afterward. 
IV. THE PLAYGROUND BADGE TESTS 
(By permission of the Playground and Recreation Association 
of America) 
The Athletic Badge Test for Boys.

It has been found that boys of 12 years of age should be able 
to qualify for the badge under the first test, elementary school 
boys of 13 years and over for the second test, and high school boys 
for the third test. It does not seem, however, that the different 
standards should be limited to these age groups. Accordingly, no
-P-A-G-E-61
  PHYSICAL TESTS 49 
age or even weight limit is fixed. Any boy may enter any test 
at any time. 
It is generally agreed among those of the greatest experience in 
the field of Physical Education, “that climbing, jumping, running 
and throwing should be considered the four fundamental activities 
to be included in any physical efficiency test,”’ and accordingly each 
of the three tests makes use of four events. Certain options are 
allowed to make the tests adaptable to varied local conditions, and 
to allow choice of those activities most interesting to the boys of 
any locality. To pass a test a boy must qualify in four events, one 
from each of the four classes, climbing, jumping, running and 
throwing. 
Rules 
No boy is permitted to receive more than one badge in any one 
year. 
It is necessary to qualify at one time in the four events in any 
one test to win a badge. If a boy fails in the tests one day he 
should be permitted to practice until he can pass the tests. 
Any responsible adult may give the tests. 
Even though a boy has not received a first test badge he may 
qualify for a badge of a higher order. 
In order to prevent the badges from falling into the hands of 
boys who have not passed the tests and are therefore not entitled 
to have the badges, the Badge Test Committee has found it wise 
to allow no sample badges to be sent out. It is suggested, in in- 
stances where it seems desirable to have badges at once for the 
purpose of arousing interest in the badge tests, that a few of the 
boys be given the tests immediately. 
All tests must be made without the aid of spiked or cleated shoes 
of any sort; tennis or gymnasium shoes are allowed. 
There shall be one trial only in the chinning, the rope climb and 
the running events. Three trials are allowed in the jumps and 
the throws except the baseball for accuracy. 
Climbing Tests 
Pull-Up (Chinning). 
A portable chinning bar in a doorway, a horizontal bar in the 
gymnasium or the rungs of a ladder set at an angle against a build- 
ing may serve the purpose. 
Each contestant begins with his hands on the bar. Then with
-P-A-G-E-62
    50 THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
his arms straightened at full length he pulls himself up, without a 
kick, snap, jerk, or swing, until his chin is above the bar. Lowering 
himself again until his arms are straight, he repeats the ‘‘Pull Up.” 
Rope Climb. 
The standard rope for this event is one and one-quarter inches 
in diameter, but any rope will be allowed provided it does not have 
any assisting devices of any sort, such as knots or balls. It must 
not be fastened at the bottom. Points 12 feet and 16 feet from 
the ground should be marked by a white or colored string or cloth 
and the climber must touch with his hand the mark indicating the 
height for his event. The start must be made from a standing 
position without a jump or spring. 
Jumping Tests 
Standing and Running Broad Jump. 
Whenever possible it is best to prepare a jumping pit by digging 
up a piece of ground about 4 feet by 25 feet and have a wooden 
or metal strip, 2 inches by 5 inches, imbedded in the ground at one 
end of the pit, flush with the surface, to serve as a ‘‘take off.” Toes 
may not project over the front of the “take off” board, nor touch 
the ground in front of it, in making the jump. Each competitor is 
allowed three jumps, his best jump being taken as his record. 
In the standing jump the feet of the competitor may be placed in any position, 
but shall leave the ground once only in making an attempt to jump. When the feet 
are lifted from the ground twice, or two springs are made in making the attempt, it 
shall count as a trial jump without result. A competitor may rock back and forward, 
lifting heels and toes alternately from the ground, but may not lift either foot clear 
of the ground, nor slide either foot along the ground in any direction.* 
All measurements shall be made from the front of the “take off” 
board to the nearest point at which any part of the body touches 
the ground. 
In the running broad jump there is no limit to the distance that 
may be run before making the jump. If a competitor runs over 
the “take off” board it shall count as one of his three trials. The 
same rule of measurement applies as in the standing jump. 
Running High Jump. 
The bar shall be a thin stick and shall rest on pins which shall project not more 
than three inches from the uprights. When this bar is removed, it shall constitute a 
trial jump without result. 
  
* The rules quoted in the fine type are with slight adaptation the rules laid down 
in the official Handbook of the Public Schools Athletic League of New York City.
-P-A-G-E-63
  PHYSICAL TESTS 51 
The height shall be measured from the middle of the bar to the ground on a 
direct line. 
Each boy shall be allowed three trial jumps at each height. 
Running under the bar in making an attempt to jump shall be counted as a balk 
and three successive balks shall constitute a trial jump.* 
Running Tests 
A stop watch is very desirable for timing these events. An 
ordinary watch with a second hand in the hands of a careful and 
conscientious man can be used for the events which require even 
seconds (no fifths), if he watches his watch closely and gives the 
signal with a handkerchief or his arm, both for starting the race 
and to indicate the expiration of the specified time. When this 
signal is given, the judges must mark any competitors not over the 
finish line. 
When a stop watch is used, each individual competitor takes his 
position on the starting mark. The starter gives the signal by 
saying: “On the mark,” ‘Get set,” “Go.” At the word “Go” 
the starter gives a signal sharply with handkerchief or arm and 
the time keeper, who is at the finish line, starts his watch. As the 
runner crosses the finish line (60 yards, 100 yards or 220 yards 
from the starting line), the time keeper stops his watch. The time 
indicated on the stop watch is the runner’s time. 
A false start is one where any part of the person of a competitor touches the 
ground in front of his mark before the starter gives the signal.* 
Throwing Tests 
Baseball Throw for Accuracy. 
Make a target 15 inches by 24 inches of wood or canvas, to 
represent the area within which a “strike” must be thrown. Sus- 
pend this target about a foot or two in front of a backstop of wire, 
a fence, or a mat in the gymnasium. The lower edge of the target 
should be 24 inches from the floor. A strike is any throw that 
hits the target enough to move it at all. (Care must be taken 
to see that the ball hits the target directly and not on the rebound. ) 
The thrower shall stand facing the target with both feet upon 
the line indicating the distance specified for this event. In de- 
livering the ball he may step forward with either foot, but his 
other foot must be upon the line when the ball is thrown.   
* The rules quoted in the fine type are with slight adaptation the rules laid down 
in the official Handbook of the Public Schools Athletic League of New York City. 
5
-P-A-G-E-64
  52 THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
Baseball Throw for Distance. 
The primary consideration here is distance, although the balls 
should be kept within a fairly well defined area, say a width of a 
road or track. Any number of steps shall be allowed but the 
thrower must not step over the line in making the throw. Measur- 
ing may be simplified by placing markers at the specified distances. 
8 Lb. Shot Put. 
A lead or iron shot should be used and care taken to get one of 
exact weight. The test calls for a put and not a throw—that is, 
the shot must be propelled from above and in front of the shoulder. 
The put is made from within a seven foot circle. Touching the 
ground in front of the circle with the foot, hand, or any part of 
the body, before the measurement is taken, makes the put count as 
one trial without result. The measurement is taken from the spot 
where the shot first touches the ground to the nearest point on the 
circumference of the circle. 
THE ATHLETIC BADGE TEST FOR GIRLS*

of the Association appointed to work out the tests.
-P-A-G-E-65
  PHYSICAL TESTS 53 
The athletic sports of the girls in rural communities begin largely 
in the schools. There are 226,000 one-room rural schools in the 
United States and because of lack of gymnasium equipment and 
dressing-room facilities, events requiring bloomers and bathing suits 
are not advisable. There are many splendid events which cannot be 
used nationally. For instance, rowing, swimming and other water 
sports are as impossible in many sections of the prairie countries as 
are skating and skiing in the south. Archery, golf, field hockey, 
horseback riding and tennis have been found to be quite beyond the 
means at the disposal of the majority of school girls in both city 
and country. There are communities in which any form of dancing 
does not meet with approval. In view of these facts, the above 
events have been agreed upon as most suitable for use throughout 
the United States. 
Rules for Tests 
There are no height, weight or age limits in the Athletic Badge 
Tests for Girls. The following general rules shall govern the final 
tests. 
Unless otherwise stated in these rules, there shall be but one 
trial in each event. If a girl fails in the tests one day she should be 
permitted to practice until she can pass the tests. 
It is necessary to qualify at one time in all three events in any 
test in order to win a badge. 
No girl is permitted to receive more than one badge in any one 
year. 
Any responsible adult may give the tests. 
No girl is entitled to more than one first, second or third test 
badge even though a full year has elapsed. 
As the tests are standard no substitutions of events should be 
made if a badge is desired. 
Even though a girl has not received a first test badge she may 
qualify for a badge of a higher order. 
In order to prevent the badges from falling into the hands of 
girls who have not passed the tests and are, therefore, not entitled 
to have the badges, the Badge Test Committee has found it wise 
to allow no sample badges to be sent out. It is suggested, in in- 
stances where it seems desirable to have badges at once for the 
purpose of arousing interest in the badge tests, that a few of the 
girls be given the tests immediately. Certification blanks will be 
sent from the office of the Playground and Recreation Association 
 
-P-A-G-E-66
  54 THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
of America upon request and prompt attention will be given to 
orders for badges. 
Directions for Events 
All-Up Indian Club Race. 
Draw two tangent circles, each three feet in diameter. In one 
of the circles place three one-pound Model BS Indian Clubs. At 
a point thirty feet distant from a line passed through the center of 
the circles, and parallel to it, draw a line to be used as a start- 
ing line. 
On the signal the girl runs from the starting line, transfers the 
three clubs, one after the other, to the vacant circle so that they 
remain standing, and runs back to the starting line. The girl makes 
three such trips, finishing at the starting line. The girl is permitted 
to use but one hand in transferring the clubs. The surface within 
the circles should be smooth and level. A wide board may be 
used when the test is made out of doors. 
To qualify in this event for a first test badge a girl must make 
the three trips to the circles in thirty seconds. 
To qualify in this event for a second test badge a girl must 
make the three trips to the circles in twenty-eight seconds. 
Potato Race. 
On a direct line draw four circles, each twelve inches in diameter 
and five yards apart from center to center. Five yards back of 
the center of the first circle and at right angles to the direct lines, 
draw a line to be used as a starting line. This is also the finish line. 
On the first circle place a basket or other receptacle not over two 
feet in height and with an opening not exceeding one foot in 
diameter. 
On the signal the girl runs from the starting line, takes one potato 
from the basket and places it in the first vacant circle (the one 
nearest the basket), runs back to the basket, passes between it and 
the starting line, takes the second potato from the basket, places 
it in the second circle, returns to the basket, passes between it and 
the starting line, takes a third potato from the basket, places it in the 
third circle and runs back to the starting line. From the starting 
line she runs to the first circle, picks up the potato and replaces it 
in the basket, passes between the basket and the starting line, runs 
to the second circle, picks up the potato, replaces it in the basket, 
passes between the basket and the starting line, runs to the third

PHYSICAL TESTS 55 
circle, picks up the potato, replaces it in the basket, and runs across 
the finish line. 
If a potato is dropped anywhere but in the circle where it should 
be placed, or in the basket, it must be picked up and properly 
placed before another is touched. 
To qualify in the event for a first test badge a girl must cross 
the finish line within forty-two seconds from the time the signal 
to start is given. 
To qualify in this event for a second test badge a girl must 
cross the finish line within thirty-nine seconds from the time the 
signal to start is given. Wooden blocks may be substituted for 
potatoes. 
Basket Ball Goal Throwing. 
The regular basket ball goal may be used or a ring eighteen 
inches in diameter (inside). It should be placed ten feet above the 
ground and the inside rim should extend six inches from the surface 
to which it is attached. 
From a point directly under the center of the goal draw a semi- 
circle with a radius of fifteen feet, for a throwing line. 
The girl may stand at any point outside of, but touching the 
throwing line. The basket ball used shall be of standard size and 
weight. 
The goal may be made either by a clear throw or by bouncing 
against the backboard. 
To qualify in this event for a first test badge a girl must make 
two goals in six trials. 
To qualify in this event for a second test badge a girl must 
make three goals in six trials.   
Balancing. 
A standard balance beam, twelve feet long and two inches wide, 
may be used, or a two- by four-inch plank, set on the two-inch side. 
The length shall'be twelve feet. 
There is no time limit in this event but there should be an en- 
deavor to meet the requirements promptly, without haste, and with 
perfect poise. 
In the first test the girl starts from the center of beam, walks 
forward to the end, without turning, walks backward to center; 
turns and walks forward to other end; turns and walks forward to 
starting point.
-P-A-G-E-68
    56 THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
In the second test the girl starts from center of beam with a bean- 
bag or book balanced on her head and walks forward to the end; 
turns and walks forward the entire length of the balance beam; 
without turning, walks backward to starting point. 
Two trials are allowed in each test. 
Running and Catching. 
At a distance of thirty feet from the starting line and parallel 
to it, stretch a cord ten feet from the ground. 
On the signal the girl runs from the starting line, tosses a 
basket ball or a volley ball over the cord, catches it, and runs back 
to the starting line. Three such trips are made, finishing at the 
starting line. In case of failure to catch the ball, it must be secured, 
tossed over the cord (either direction) and caught before con- 
tinuing the run. 
The starting line and the cord should both be well away from 
any wall, backstop, or other object, so that neither the contestant 
nor the ball shall touch any obstruction during the run. 
To qualify for a badge in this event the three trips must be made 
in twenty seconds. 
Throwing for Distance. 
A circle six feet in diameter shall be marked on the floor or 
ground. In throwing, contestants shall not touch outside the circle 
with any part of the body until after the ball has struck the ground. 
If any part of the body touches outside the circle, the distance made 
shall not be recorded but the throw shall count as one trial. Three 
trials are allowed and the best throw shall be taken as the record. 
The throw is to be made with one hand, and the distance required 
to qualify is forty-two feet with a basket ball or forty-four feet 
with a volley ball. If this test is made out of doors, it should be 
done on a day when the wind does not blow. 
Volley Ball Serving. 
A volley ball net or piece of cord should be stretched at a center 
height of eight feet across the playing space. Twenty-four feet dis- 
tant a line shall be drawn on the floor or ground parallel to the net. 
The contestant, with volley ball in hand, shall stand facing the net 
and toeing the line with either foot. She tosses the ball with one 
hand, as in tennis, and strikes it with the other hand over the net
-P-A-G-E-69

so that it shall fall within a square ten by ten feet. This square shall 
be marked on the floor or ground ten feet from the net and at 
right angles to it. Five trials are allowed to make three aces. If 
the contestant steps forward over the line before the ball strikes the 
ground, no score is allowed, but it counts as one trial.

  58 THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
VI. THE NEW AGE-GRADE-HEIGHT-WEIGHT 
ATHLETIC STANDARD 
(By permission of Dr. W. S. Small, U. S. Bureau of Ed.) 
Boys and girls have more interest in play and exercise if some 
real and definite object is in view. To play or exercise, when the 
object is to win, is far more interesting than to exercise simply for 
the sake of exercise. Play and athletic activities carry with them 
great interest when some record is to be attained; especially is this 
true if the record stands for all-round physical ability and fitness. 
The desire to equal the record, or to win over the record, is a con- 
trolling factor in such activities. These activities take on added 
interest when the records have been standardized for the whole city, 
county, State, or Nation. 
We do not have any nation-wide, concise, graded records of 
athletic events suitable for boys and girls in the various grades and 
high school. A number of directors in the larger cities have their 
city standards; the work accomplished in many instances has been 
very commendable. We need to have a national standard, records 
that will be of interest to the boys and girls in the country as well 
as in the city. 
Athletic records are usually based either on age or weight. 
Neither of these classifications alone is satisfactory. Two boys 
or girls may be of the same age, yet differ in weight, grade, and 
height. Differences will also exist when weight is made the basis 
of classification. Athletic records, to be just to all pupils, should 
be based on these four determining factors; namely, age, grade 
or mentality, height, and weight. Records, covering a large range 
of activities and based on these factors, do not exist. Such records 
would be highly prized and would add a new impetus to athletic 
activities because of their fairness to all pupils. To secure data for 
this new athletic standard based on age, grade, height, and weight, 
is the purpose of the material in hand. No doubt the outline of 
events, according to grade, will also offer a valuable constructive 
program of athletic activities. 
The program of events, as given, should not be considered com- 
plete or ideal; a great variety of games, rhythmic plays, and com- 
petitive sports should be included.

Description of Athletic Events 
All-up Indian Club Race. 
Draw two tangent circles, 3 feet in diameter. Thirty feet 
from a line drawn through the center of the circles and parallel 
 
-P-A-G-E-73
PHYSICAL TESTS 65 
to it draw a starting line. Place three 1-pound model BS Indian 
clubs in a standing position in one circle. 
On the signal the player runs to the circles and transfers the 
three clubs, one after the other using but one hand, to the other 
circle, and then runs back and touches the starting line. The 
player makes three such trips, finishing at the starting line. If 
a club falls over, it must be set up before the run is counted. If 
this event is conducted outdoors, a wide board may be used. See 
“dashes” for start and finish. 
Baseball Distance Throw. 
For the league baseball throw use regular league baseball. For 
the playground baseball throw use regular 12-inch playground 
baseball or indoor baseball. The thrower may run any distance be- 
fore making the throw. Measure distance from the throwing line, 
directly in front of thrower, to spot where the ball first struck 
the ground. If the player crosses the throwing line before the 
ball strikes the ground, the throw shall not be measured. 
Basket Ball Distance Throw. 
Draw a circle 6 feet in diameter on the floor or ground. In 
throwing, contestant shall not touch outside the circle with any 
part of the body until the ball has struck the ground; he must 
leave from the rear half of the circle. Pass the tape through the 
center of the circle, but measure distance from edge of circle to 
spot where the ball first struck the ground. If any part of the body 
touches outside the circle, the distance made shall not be recorded. 
Round Arm Throw. 
In making the round arm throw only one hand shall be used. 
The ball may be started from any position and thrown in any 
manner or style. 
Forward Overhead Distance Throw. 
The ball shall be grasped with both hands, placed behind the 
head, and thrown forward from this position. 
Backward Overhead Distance Throw. 
The ball shall be grasped with both hands and thrown backward 
over the head. 
Chest Expansion. 
The tape, in measuring the chest expansion, shall pass around 
   
-P-A-G-E-74
62 THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
the chest just below the shoulder blades and at right angles to 
the spine. As much air as possible should be expelled from the 
lungs, and the measurement noted; the lungs should then be filled, 
and the measurement noted again. The difference between the two 
measurements indicates the chest expansion. 
The pupil should be urged to inhale deeply and to expel the air 
from the lungs several times before the measurement is made. 
Dashes. 
Runners may start from the standing or crouching position. If 
from the standing position, no part of the body may be ahead of the 
starting line; if from the crouching position, the fingers must be 
back of the starting line. 
The starter gives the signal by saying: “On your marks,” “Get 
set,” “Go!” If the runner prefers the crouching start, he should 
take the following positions with respect to the commands: “On. 
your marks”’; place fingers on starting line; one knee on the ground, 
about 8 or 10 inches from the starting line; other foot beside knee. 
“Get set’; raises body off knee, pitching slightly forward and rest- 
ing on hands and toes. Instead of ‘‘Go,” if possible, use a starter’s 
gun or strike together two boards. The runner may dig small 
holes for “toe grips.” 
The timer shall be stationed at the finishing line and shall start 
his watch, when he hears the word ‘‘Go,” or the instant he sees the 
smoke of the gun. A white cord, held chest high, at the finishing 
line, must be “breasted” by the runner and not touched with the 
hands. The instant the runner breasts the cord the timer shall stop 
his watch. The time is the number of seconds elapsed from the 
beginning to the end of the run. 
If the runner leaves the ‘‘mark” before the signal “Go” is given, 
he shall be called back and start again. 
Discus Throw. 
The discus shall be thrown from a circle 7 feet in diameter. The 
contestant shall not touch the outside of the circle with any part 
of the body; he must leave from the rear of the circle and not until 
the discus strikes the ground. Pass the tape through the center of 
the circle, but measure the distance from the edge of the circle to 
spot where the discus first struck the ground. 
Flag Race. 
Six 1-pint bottles (grape-juice bottles) and three 10 or 12 
inch flags are necessary.
-P-A-G-E-75
  PHYSICAL TESTS 63 
Arrangements for boys: The bottles shall be placed in a row. 
There shall be a distance of 5 feet between each of the bottles num- 
bered 1, 2, 3 and 4, 5,6. The distance between bottles numbered 
3 and 4 shall be 15 feet. The starting line for Grade VI shall be 30 
feet, for Grade VII 40 feet, and for Grade VIII 50 feet from 
bottle No. 1. 
Arrangement for girls: Arrange bottles Nos. 1, 2, and 3 and 
bottles 4, 5, and 6 as described above. The distance between 
bottles Nos. 3 and 4 shall be 10 feet. The starting line for Grade 
VI shall be 20 feet, for Grade VII 25 feet, and for Grade VIII and 
High School 35 feet from bottle No. 1. 
The race for boys and girls is the same. Place one flag in each of 
bottles Nos. 1, 2,and 3. The contestant runs from the starting line, 
removes the flag from the bottle No. 1 and places it in bottle No. 4. 
He returns for flag No. 2, passing between bottles Nos. 1 and 2, 
and places it in bottle No. 5. He returns for flag No. 3, passing 
between bottles Nos. 2 and 3 and places it in bottle No. 6, and 
then crosses the starting line. See “Dashes” for start and finish. 
Hurdles. 
220 yard low: Ten hurdles, 2% feet high. A lath placed on 
two uprights driven in the ground will be satisfactory. The hurdles 
shall be placed 20 yards apart. The starting line shall be 20 yards 
from the first hurdle and the finishing line 20 yards from the last 
hurdle. The hurdler shall be permitted to knock down only two 
hurdles. See “Dashes” for start and finish. 
120 yard high: Ten hurdles, 3% feet high. The starting line 
shall be 15 yards from the first hurdle and the finishing line 15 
yards from the last hurdle. The hurdler shall be permitted to 
knock down only two hurdles. 
Javelin Throw. 
The contestant may run any distance before making the throw. 
Measure the distance from the throwing line to spot where the 
javelin first struck the ground. If the contestant crosses the throw- 
ing line before the javelin strikes the ground, the distance shall 
not be measured. 
Pole Vault. 
The jumping standards shall be placed on level ground. The 
ground on one side of the standards shall be spaded, making a jump- 
ing pit of suitable size. A straight, nonsagging crossbar shall be 
used; the crossbar to rest on top of the standards. A straight cane 
 
-P-A-G-E-76
er eee ee 
64 THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
fishpole will serve as a crossbar. If the bar sags, the height should 
be measured from the center of the bar. 
Potato Race. 
On a direct line draw four circles, 12 inches in diameter and 5 
yards from the center to center. A starting line, which is also the 
finishing line, shall be drawn at the following distances from the 
center of first circle and at right angles to the direct line: 
For boys: Grade VI, 5 yards; Grade VII, 5 yards; Grade VIII, 
10 yards; and for High School, 10 yards. 
For girls of Grades VII and VIII and High School: Five yards. 
On the first circle place a basket or other receptacle not over 
2 feet in height and with an opening not exceeding 1 foot in 
diameter. The basket should contain three potatoes or blocks of 
wood 2 inches square. 
On the signal the player runs from the starting line, takes one 
potato from the basket and places it in the first vacant circle (the 
one nearest the basket), runs back to the basket, passes between 
it and the starting line, takes the second potato from the basket, 
places it in the second circle, returns to the basket, passes between 
it and the starting line, takes the third potato from the basket, 
places it in the third circle and runs back to the starting line. From 
the starting line the player runs to the first circle, picks up the potato 
and replaces it in the basket, passes between the basket and the 
starting line, runs to the second circle, picks up the potato, replaces 
it in the basket, passes between the basket and the starting line, 
runs to the third circle, picks up the potato, replaces it in the basket 
and runs across the finish line. 
If a potato is dropped anywhere but in the circle in which it 
should be placed or in the basket, it must be picked up and properly 
placed before another is touched. See ‘‘Dashes”’ for start and finish. 
Pull Up. 
A portable chinning bar in a doorway, a horizontal bar in the 
gymnasium or on a playground, or the rungs of a ladder set at an 
angle against a building may serve the purpose. 
| Each contestant begins with his hands on the bar; the feet should 
be at least 6 inches from the floor. Then with the arms straightened 
; at full length he pulls himself up without a kick, snap, jerk, or swing, 
until his chin is above the bar. Lowering himself again (without 
resting) until his arms are straight, he immediately repeats the 
“pull up.” Each pull up counts one time. 
 
-P-A-G-E-77
  PHYSICAL TESTS 65 
Punting Football. 
The regular Rugby football shall be used. The punter may 
run any distance before the punt is made. Measure distance from 
punting line, directly in front of punter, to spot where the ball first 
struck the ground. If the punter crosses the punting line before 
the ball strikes the ground the punt shall not be measured. 
Push Up. 
Pupil lies on the floor, face downward, hands open and placed 
close to the shoulders. Straighten arms, supporting weight on 
hands and toes, keeping back stiff. Lower body, and without rest- 
ing raise body. Each push up counts one time. A large sheet of 
paper placed on the floor will prevent the clothing from becoming 
soiled. 
Putting 8 and 12 pound shot. 
The shot shall be put from a circle 7 feet in diameter. The con- 
testant shall not touch the outside of the circle while making the 
“put”; he must leave from the rear of the circle, and not until 
the shot strikes the ground. Pass the tape through the center of 
the circle, but measure the distance from the edge of the circle to 
spot where the shot first struck the ground. 
Runs. 
See “Dashes” for start and finish. 
Running and Catching. 
At a distance of 30 feet from the starting line and parallel to it, 
stretch a cord 10 feet from the ground. 
On the signal the girl runs from the starting line, tosses a basket 
ball or a volley ball over the cord, catches it, and runs back to the 
starting line. Three such trips are made, finishing at the starting 
line. In case of failure to catch the ball, it must be secured, tossed 
over the cord (either direction), and caught before continuing the 
run. 
The starting line and the cord should both be well away from any 
wall, backstop, or other object, so that neither the contestant nor 
the ball shall touch any obstruction during the run. 
Running Broad Jump. 
A take-off, 4 inches by 18 inches, should be firmly imbedded in 
the ground; the edge nearest the running path shall be flush with 
 
-P-A-G-E-78
    66 THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
the surface. The take-off should be painted white. If the take-off 
is nailed to a plank about 3 feet long and 1 foot wide, and the plank 
imbedded sufficiently deep, as directed above, the take-off will be 
very firm. The ground shall be spaded some distance from the 
take-off, making a jumping pit of suitable size. Measure distance 
from the edge of the take-off, nearest to the jumping pit, to spot 
where the heel or hand nearest the take-off first touched the ground. 
If the player steps over the take-off, the distance shall not be 
measured. 
Running High Jump. 
See “Pole Vault.” 
Running Hop, Step, and Jump. 
Arrange take-off as described under “Running Broad Jump”; if . 
the event is conducted indoors, a chalkmark will answer for the 
take-off. The player hops off the take-off or line, landing on the 
same foot from which he hopped; from this position he takes one 
step, landing on the opposite foot; the jump is taken from this 
foot, landing on both feet. The greatest effort should be put into 
the jump. Measure distance from edge of the take-off or line, to 
spot where the foot or hand nearest the take-off first touched the 
ground on the jump. If a player steps over the take-off the distance 
shall not be measured. 
Sit Up. 
Pupil lies on his back, head resting on floor, feet together, arms 
extended, hands open and palms placed on top of thighs. Pupil 
raises trunk of body to a sitting position, keeping heels on floor, 
knees and elbows straight, permitting hands to slide over thighs 
and knees; pupil must not grasp clothing with hands. When the 
sitting position is reached the trunk is immediately lowered, and 
when head touches the floor the trunk is immediately raised. Each 
erect position counts one time. 
Standing Broad Jump. 
Arrange take-off as described under ‘Running Broad Jump”; 
if the event is conducted indoors, a chalkmark will answer for the 
take-off. The player toes the edge of the take-off or line. Measure 
distance from the take-off or line to spot where heel or hand nearest 
the take-off first touched the ground or floor. 
The feet of the competitor may be placed in any position, but 
shall leave the ground once only in making an attempt to jump. A

competitor may rock backward and forward, lifting heels and toes 
alternately from the ground, but may not lift either foot clear of the 
ground, nor slide either foot along the ground in any direction,

  CHAPTER VII 
CONTESTS RESEMBLING GAMES 
Archery, Bowling, Golf, and track athletics have been classed 
as simple contests, because in all of them each player has the same 
thing to do as all the others, and it is a fundamental principle that 
the conditions of performance should be exactly the same for all. 
In the following contests we have a resemblance to the preceding, 
but the play of one may change the conditions under which those 
coming later must take part; still we have not yet the freedom of 
action and direct opposition that are found in games, and herice 
they are placed in an intermediate group. 
Hop Scotch. 
This is played by children and especially by girls from eight to 
fourteen years of age. There are two forms of the play, the one 
most commonly played at present being as follows: 
Twenty squares, from 20 to 30 inches on a side, are marked 
out on a sidewalk or smooth ground, in two rows of ten each. The 
object of the play is to hop from one square to the next, up one 
row and back the other, without stepping on a line or touching the 
other foot to the ground. Each player has a trial in turn, and 
each one who succeeds may mark any square in the series with her 
initial, after which she may in any trial stop and rest on both feet 
in this square, while the other players must hop across it without 
touching it. This continues until the play is blocked by some 
player’s having so many squares in a row that no one can hop over 
them, or until all the squares are taken. The one having the most 
squares marked is the winner. 
Croquet. 
In croquet each player has a ball and a mallet. The object of 
the play is to drive the ball through a series of 14 arches or wickets, 
following a uniform course and striking two stakes in proper order. 
Each player making an arch or stake may have a trial at the next 
one, in order, and continues until he misses. Thus far croquet is a 
11 
 
-P-A-G-E-90
  78 THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
simple contest; but instead of making an arch, a player may, with 
any stroke, hit'the ball of a partner or an opponent, and then may 
lay his ball beside the one that was hit and strike it so as to move 
the other ball as well as his own; a partner’s ball is sent forward to 
a better position and an opponent’s ball is driven to a place from 
which it will be more difficult or impossible to make an arch. The 
player or team first to finish a round of the arches and stakes is the 
winner. Roque is a game like croquet, played with balls, mallets, 
and arches much more accurately made, and upon a more perfect 
ground. 
Pitching Horse Shoes. 
Two pegs are driven firmly into the ground 40 feet apart. The 
pegs are 1 inch in diameter and extend six inches above the surface 
of the ground. The pitcher’s box extends three feet on each side 
and to the rear of the peg and four feet in front, marked out on 
the ground. 
Standing anywhere in the box, each player pitches two horse 
shoes at the other peg. Any shoe remaining farther than eight 
inches from the peg is removed before the score is counted. 
The closest shoe to the peg scores one point; if both of a player’s 
shoes are nearer the peg than his opponent’s, two points are scored. 
A ringer scores three and a leaner scores two. A shoe at the same 
distance from the peg as an opponent’s counts as a tie, and the two 
are removed and the remainder counted. 
A regulation game is 21 points. 
Some organizations play under rules which do not count the 
leaner as entitled to the extra reward given above. Playground 
people use shorter distances for younger boys, the popular distances 
being 33 feet or 27 feet. 
This would be a contest but for the fact that a shoe pitched may 
move one pitched before, or it may hinder a later one from taking 
a winning position. This interference gives it some of the character 
of a game, as in croquet. 
Quoits. 
Quoits is a similar play, using metal rings or quoits, and the 
pegs are 54 feet apart. The scoring rules are similar. 
Curling. 
Curling is an ice sport closely resembling quoits in general plan. 
Two holes, called ‘‘tees,” are cut into but not through the ice and
-P-A-G-E-91
CONTESTS RESEMBLING GAMES 79 
these correspond to the stakes; they are 44 feet apart. Instead 
of quoits, curling stones are used. These are rounded boulders 
of granite weighing from 30 to 50 pounds, and each having a handle 
at the top. Each player bowls his stone along the ice in his turn, 
and the score is counted as in quoits. An additional feature of 
curling is that a partner of a player, with a broom, may sweep the 
ice ahead of his stone until it reaches the tee, to make it easier for 
it to slide and so to help it on or guide it; after it passes the tee 
the opponents may sweep ahead of it. Four players make a team; 
the captain is called the “skip,” and has full control of the play of 
the team. 
  Diagram of Curling Rink 
Bowling on the Green. 
This is a form of play bearing a close resemblance, in many ways, 
to the two preceding. It is played on a smooth lawn with wooden 
balls that are not round, having one side turned:.with a less curva- 
ture than the other. Each player has two of these “bowls”; a 
smaller ball, of different color, is called the “jack.” The first 
player bowls the jack out on the lawn as a mark for the bowling. 
The bowls are bowled at it in turn, and the score is counted, as in 
quoits and curling, by noting the nearness of the balls to the jack. 
Here the jack, as well as the other bowls may be moved by a blow; 
this makes it more like a true game to that extent. The players 
bowl from a small rubber mat, and when a turn is completed, the 
mat is carried to the position of the jack, and the bowling is re- 
peated from this point in such directions as the first player sees 
fit to bowl the jack for the next round,
-P-A-G-E-92
CHAPTER VIII 
GOAL GAMES 
These are games suitable for small children or for social gather- 
ings. Competition centers about getting possession of a goal or 
base. There are three groups, varying much in the degree of 
activity, but the most active ones are in the second group. 
GROUP I 
Only two players active at a time, while the others stand and 
look on. 
Good Morning. 
Players in a circle. One player goes around outside of the circle 
and taps another player on the back. They run around opposite 
ways and on meeting on the other side of the circle they must 
stop and shake hands and bow and say, “Good Morning” three 
times and then go on in the same direction as before. The one 
reaching vacant place last must start a new game. 
Run for Your Supper. 
Players in a circle. One player chosen by teacher goes around 
inside, holds out his hands between two players and says, “Run 
for your supper.” The two run around opposite ways outside; 
the one who first returns to the vacant place wins, and may start 
the next runners. The game may be varied by skipping, walking, 
galloping, flying, etc., instead of running. 
The Beater Goes Round. 
Players seated, eyes closed and hands held behind the back. A 
player with a knotted handkerchief goes up and down the aisles 
on tiptoe and drops the handkerchief in some player’s hands. The 
player receiving the handkerchief at once begins to beat the one 
in front of him between the shoulders with it. The one hit jumps 
up and runs around the room to escape and the beater chases him 
and hits him as often as he can until the runner has regained his own 
80

  GOAL GAMES 81 
seat. The beater then goes around on tiptoe, puts the handkerchief 
in another player’s hands, and the game goes on. This can also 
be played ina circle in an open space. It is known by various names, 
lately by the title, “Swat the Kaiser.” A towel rolled in the form 
of a club is often used. 
GROUP II 
All the players are active in this group of games, the conipeti- 
tion beginning in the first few at a signal, but in later ones becoming 
more and more by free choice of the players. 
Marching to Jerusalem. 
Pupils seated at desks. Alternate rows stand. At a signal from 
the teacher they march around their own row of seats. When the 
teacher claps her hands each player sits in the nearest seat. At 
the next signal to stand those in the front seats must remain seated. 
The play continues, those in second seats remaining seated next 
time; then third, fourth, etc., until the last two players in the row 
race for the remaining seat when teacher claps hands. This game 
can be played with chairs, one less than the number of players. 
chairs arranged in two rows back to back, one row facing front. 
alternate right and left, or in a circle with backs toward center. 
When a piano is available, use a chord as a signal to stand, players 
begin marching when the music begins and take seats when it stops. 
A later and better name for this game is ‘‘Musical Chairs.” 
Jack Be Quick. 
Like “Marching to Jerusalem,” but played in an open space. 
Mark as many places on the floor as there are players, less one, 
these marks being in four groups in distant parts of the room. If 
there is a piano it can be used. When the music begins all the 
players must follow the odd player in a march about the center 
of the room; when the music stops, all rush for the marked places. 
The one left out is leader next time. Chairs can be used in place 
of floor marks if they are available. Teacher or odd player gives 
the signals when music is not to be had. 
Nine Pins. 
Players in couples, marching to music in a circle. One player, 
who is “it,” stands in the center. When the music stops, every player 
on the inner side must move forward and join the outside player of 
 
-P-A-G-E-94
  82 THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
the next couple ahead. The one who is “it” tries to get a place. 
He must not leave the center till the music stops. The one left out 
must go in the center for the next play. Signals may be used as in 
“Marching to Jerusalem,” when no music is available. 
Merry Go Round. 
Players in a double circle, inside line start with right hand toward 
center and outside line with left hand toward center, the two lines 
marching in opposite directions. An odd player stands in the center, 
and on a signal or when music stops, all stop marching and with 
right hand grasp right hand of a partner; the odd player tries to 
getapartner. The one left out goes in the center next time. 
Snatch a Club. 
This is like “Marching to Jerusalem,” but is played without 
seats. Each player but one has an Indian club. All march ina circle, 
stop and place clubs on floor just within the circle of players. They 
march forward around the circle of clubs with the music or by a 
signal, and when the music stops or a second signal is given, all try to 
snatch a club. The one who fails to get a club must give the signals 
for the next round and, when the clubs are placed on the floor, 
must take one and go and sit down when his duty as leader is done. 
Continue until but one player is left as a winner. Beanbags may 
be used in place of Indian clubs. It is well to mark the circle for 
clubs with chalk beforehand. 
The First of May. 
Two adjacent rows play a game together. The first of May is 
moving time, and the seats are houses. One player is chosen to 
be ‘‘it” and he walks up and down the street between the two rows. 
The residents along the street change houses before and behind him 
and he tries to get a house while it is vacated. The seats not 
occupied and one more must be marked or taken away and not 
_ used in the game, so that there is at all times one person without a 
house. If the people do not move often enough the one who is “‘it” 
may number the players and then when he calls two or three num- 
bers they must change places, 
Mailman. 
Players in a circle. Each chooses the name of a postoffice, which 
may be that of any city. One player stands in the center and is the
-P-A-G-E-95
GOAL GAMES 83 
mailman. He asks each one in order what postofiice he represents, 
and they must answer. He then calls the name of two or three 
postoffices and the players having those names must change places. 
If the mailman can get a place during the exchange the one left out 
must be the mailman. If the players do not change places promptly 
the mailman may count ten, and any player who has not then left 
his place forfeits it, and must change places with the mailman. 
Roll Ball. ~ 
Players in a circle. One player in the center is “it.” He has 
the ball which he tries to roll on the floor so that it will pass between 
two players. They try to stop it with feet or hands. When he 
succeeds in rolling the ball out, the player at whose right the ball 
passed out must change places with him. The ball must not leave 
the floor and must not be kicked. 
Pin Guard. 
Players standing in a circle. An Indian club stands in center 
and the one who is “it” has to guard the club. The players in the 
circle have a basketball which they throw at the club. Any player 
knocking down the club or causing the one who is “‘it” to knock it 
- down may be “‘it.” If the one who is ‘“‘it” can get the ball he may 
throw it beyond the circle, giving him a rest. If too easy to guard, 
use three clubs, or draw a three foot circle on the floor about the 
club and require the guard to stay out of the circle. 
Puss in the Corner. 
Each player but one has a goal. It may be a chair, desk, mark, 
other object, or a corner. The one who has no goal goes up to an- 
other player and says, “Pussy wants a corner.’ The answer is, 
“Ask the next door neighbor.’ During this time the others change 
goals, and the odd player tries to get one. When he has tried sev- 
eral times without success he may go to the center of the space and 
call, ‘‘All Change,” and all must change goals, giving him a better 
chance. The one left out is “it” and the game begins as before. 
Squirrels in Trees. »~ 
Have three players stand so as to represent a hollow tree, 
facing center with hands on each other’s shoulders; have a fourth 
player stoop within to represent a squirrel. Have the other players 
notice how this is done and then have them all form groups of four 
in same way. There must be one extra player who is a squirrel 
7   
-P-A-G-E-96
  84 THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
without a tree. When the teacher claps hands all the squirrels 
must change trees, and the homeless squirrel tries to get a tree. 
This leaves another squirrel out and the game is repeated. After 
a few plays have each squirrel choose one of the players of the tree 
to change places with him, so as to give all a chance to be squirrels. 
When numbers are small, circles or other marks on the floor may 
represent trees. 
GROUP III 
Games with a common goal. 
These are usually played outdoors and by players a little older 
than the preceding: they are all games of hiding and seeking. A 
goal or home is chosen; one player is usually “it,” and the others 
are given opportunity to hide in different ways. Most of the games 
are dramatic to a considerable degree. “Counting Out” rhymes are 
used to decide who shall be “‘it” the first time. 
I Spy. 
Here the one who is “‘it’”” covers his eyes while he counts one 
hundred or some other number agreed upon. Then he seeks the 
players who have hidden. To catch a player, the one who is “it” 
must see him, call “I Spy ( ),” and then tag the goal. If one 
can reach the goal before the one who is “it” can do so, he is free.   
Go—Stop. 
This differs from the former only in the manner of blinding. 
The game starts with all the players touching the goal; the one 
who is “‘it’” says “Go,” shuts his eyes while counting ten aloud, 
then calls “Stop,” and opens his eyes. Anyone seen moving must 
come back to the goal. This is repeated till all have gotten out of 
sight, then the search begins and proceeds as in I Spy. 
Green Wolf, or Relievo. 
This game is like “I Spy,’ but a stick is leaned against the goal 
and any player in hiding, who can run to the goal and throw the 
stick away before the one who is “‘it” can reach it, may hide again, 
and all those who were caught before are also free to hide again. 
As soon as the one who is “it” can replace the stick he may again 
seek those hiding. A variation of this game is called ‘Kick the 
Can.” A tin can standing in a circle marked on the ground is used 
instead of a stick.
-P-A-G-E-97
  
GOAL GAMES 85 
Run, Sheep, Run. 
This is a team game of hide and seek, played in grammar grades. 
Two teams are chosen, one hiding and the other blinding. The 
captain of each team is the shepherd and does not hide, but he hides 
the others. He calls warning to the sheep as the others search, 
and when he thinks best calls, “Run, Sheep, Run,” when they all 
jump up and race for the goal. The player reaching the goal first 
wins the game for his side. Then the other side hides, etc. 
Wolf. 
This game involves tagging, but it is so much like this group of 
games that it is best described here. The player who is “it” is 
called the wolf, and he hides while the others all blind at the goal. 
When he is ready they all go to hunt for him. When one sees the 
wolf he shouts, “Wolf” and all race for the goal. If the wolf 
can tag any before they reach the goal, those tagged become wolves 
with him and go and hide along with him. The game continues 
until either all are wolves or all the wolves are caught by the others. 
 
-P-A-G-E-98
  CHAPTER IX 
TAG GAMES 
Hunting and warfare are symbolized by tag games, the main 
activities being chasing and flight, ending in capture or escape. 
Capture is usually indicated by “tagging,” which means touching 
with the hand; sometimes one is captured by hitting him with a 
thrown object, or it may be required that a runner be actually held, 
at least long enough to tag him three times. Most of these games 
are entirely individualistic, but a few involve simple codperation. 
The first group to be described are suited to small children, 
being at all stages under immediate control by the teacher. They 
also involve but a limited amount of activity. 
GROUP I 
Only a few players active at once, usually only two or three. The 
later games of the group are so planned that the teacher can call 
into activity several players if desirable. The first games bring 
into the play only the two or more chosen by the teacher; the later 
ones use the other players more or less to help or hinder the chaser 
in his effort to capture the runner. 
Fox and Farmer. 
The players stand in a circle, hands at sides. The farmer tries 
to tag the fox, the fox runs in a zigzag manner among the players, 
and the farmer must follow in exactly the same path. When the 
farmer catches the fox the teacher appoints two other players to 
be fox and farmer. 
In this game a runner and a catcher are both chosen by the 
teacher; the catcher must go in the exact path of the runner, and 
the other players have only to stand and look on while the chase 
goes on. It is suitable for special cases where there is liability 
to overdo and hence, where the teacher should control every detail 
of exertion. 
36
-P-A-G-E-99
  TAG GAMES 87 
Cat and Rat. 
Players in a circle, grasping hands. One player is outside and 
is the cat; another is within and is the rat. The cat says, “I am 
the cat.” The rat replies, ‘‘I am the rat.” The cat says, “I will 
catch you.” The rat says, “You never can.’ The cat then tries 
to tag the rat. The players assist the rat by letting him pass under 
arms, and prevent the cat from doing so. If it proves too difficult 
for the cat to tag the rat, have two cats chase the same rat. If 
there are 40 or more players, it will be better to have two games. 
When the rat is caught, let those who have been running go in the 
circle, and choose other runners. 
Squirrel and Nut. 
Players all seated but one, heads on desks and eyes vovered, 
one hand open on desk with palm up. The odd player is a squirrel 
and passes up and down between the rows and puts a nut in some 
player’s hand. This one rises and chases the squirrel. If the 
squirrel is caught before he can reach his own seat, another squirrel 
ischosen. If the squirrel is not caught, he can be squirrel again. 
Maze Tag. 
Players standing in an open space so as to make straight rows, 
both from front and to rear and from side to side. A runner and 
a chaser are chosen. Players all face same way and grasp hands 
with those on each side. Chaser tries to tag runner, going up and 
down the rows but not breaking through or going under arms. 
The teacher aids the runner or chaser by commanding “right face” 
or “left face” at the proper time. At this command the players 
drop hands, face, grasp hands in the new direction, thus blocking 
or opening a passage for one of those who are running. Two 
chasers may chase the same runner, if tagging proves difficult. 
Choose new runners at frequent intervals. 
Snake Tag\(Fox and Chickens). 
All the players except the catcher stand in single file with hands 
on the shoulders of the one in front. The one at the rear of the 
line is the one to be caught. The catcher tries to tag him, while 
the line of players tries to turn so as to keep one or more between 
the catcher and his’prey. The best player or teacher should stand 
at the front of the line and lead the others in blocking the chaser.
-P-A-G-E-100
    88 THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY. 
Schoolroom Tag. 
Mark a circle on floor in front of desks. Choose a player to be 
“it.” He stands near but not in the circle and calls the names of 
three players. The players must rise and try to reach the circle 
without being tagged. They may run in any aisle in either direc- 
tion. As soon as this is done, promptly choose another to be “‘it” 
and the game continues as before. If none are caught, three more 
are named. Encourage naming players who have not been called. 
Cat and Mice. 
One player is chosen to be cat, and hides behind or under the 
teacher’s desk. After the cat is hidden, the teacher beckons to 
five or six other players, who creep softly up to the desk, and when 
all are assembled, scratch on it with their fingers, to represent the 
nibbling of mice. As soon as the cat hears this, she scrambles out 
from under the desk and gives chase to the mice, who may save 
themselves only by getting back to their holes (seats). If no 
mouse is caught, the same cat may continue, or the teacher may 
choose another at her discretion. A different set of mice should 
be chosen each time, so as to give all of the players an opportunity 
to join in the game. 
GROUP II 
Tag games of the second type usually have but two or three 
players active at once, but the play is made continuous by a rule 
that the winner or loser of the first round shall start the next 
round, and this also furnishes added incentive to make each 
player do his best. Whether the winner or loser should be “‘it”’ 
for the next round depends in part on the game and in part on the 
temper of the players. If they look upon the chance to be “‘it” as a 
privilege, and all would like to be “it,” then the winner should 
have it, but if it appeals to the players as a task, it should be 
assigned to the loser. It will be noticed that in the description 
of the games it is sometimes the winner and sometimes the loser 
who is said to be “it” for the next round, but it will often be desir- 
able to reverse this rule to fit the temper of the players. To make 
the winner “it” brings in the best players all the time, while the 
other plan calls out the slower and more indifferent ones. To 
make this group of games successful the teacher must study the 
problem and decide this point wisely.
-P-A-G-E-101
  TAG GAMES 89 
Drop the Handkerchief. 
Players in a circle facing in. One player, who is called the 
“runner,” runs around outside the circle and drops a handkerchief 
on the floor behind some player, who then becomes ‘“‘chaser.”” The 
chaser tries to tag the runner before he can reach the vacant place 
the chaser has left. Both may run around, across, or through the 
circle. If the chaser tags the runner, the latter is runner again; 
if not, the chaser becomes runner for the next game, dropping the 
handkerchief behind another player. 
This can be played in the schoolroom. Players sit at their desks 
and must face front. Runner goes up and down between rows and 
drops handkerchief on the desk behind the one who is to be chaser. 
If the runner reaches his own seat before the chaser tags him, the 
latter is runner for the next game. Players may bow heads and 
hold hands behind ready for the handkerchief, which is then placed 
in the hands. 
Exchange Tag. 
Players seated. One chosen to be “it” stands in front of the 
rows of seats. The teacher calls the names of two players who 
must try to exchange seats before the one who is “‘it” can tag either 
of them. The one tagged is ‘‘it.” If neither is tagged, two other 
names are called with the same one “‘it.” 
Last Couple Out. 
Groups of 7-12 players each play separate games, as the game 
is not suited to larger numbers. Players stand in couples and the 
odd player is “it.” The couples stand in line and the odd player in 
front. He calls, ‘Last Couple Out” and the rear couple must 
separate, run forward, and try to touch one another again before 
the odd player can tag either of them. The odd player may not look 
around and so cannot see the players till they have passed him. If 
they succeed, the odd player is “‘it” again. If he tags one, that 
one is “it” and the catcher has the other one of the couple for a 
partner. 
Center Base. 
Players in a circle, a ball or other object plated in the center. 
Choose one player to be “‘it.”” This player takes the ball and hands 
it to another player. The player receiving it must replace the 
ball in the center of the circle and then try to tag the one who is “it”
-P-A-G-E-102
  90 THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
before the latter can touch the ball. Either player may run around 
or through the circle in any direction. If the one who is “it” can 
touch the ball before he is caught, he may be “it” again. If he is 
caught, he goes in the circle and the chaser is ‘‘it.”” 
Bull in the Ring. 
From 8 to 12 players stand in a circle with hands firmly grasped, 
forming a closed ring. One player, who is the Bull, stands within. 
It is his object to break through the line and get away; it is their 
object to keep him inside. He walks about and examines the arms 
and hands and asks what these parts of the ring are made of. They 
reply, ‘‘Iron,” “Wood,” “Leather,” “Steel,” inventing something 
as best they can to suggest the difficulty of breaking through. He 
then tries to break through; and, when he succeeds, he runs away 
and the others give chase. The one who is first to tag him can be 
the Bull next time. This is a rough game suited to lower grade boys. 
Bulldog and Master. 
A group of children from 5 to 15 in number. One is “Bulldog” 
and one is “Master.” The others stand in a row facing the master. 
The bulldog chooses a color, which he whispers to the master, so 
the others cannot hear. The master then gives the children turns 
in guessing the color. If a child guesses it, the master tells him to 
“Chase the bulldog,” and the child who guessed the color chases 
the bulldog. If he catches him, he must get back and touch the 
master’s hand before the bulldog does. Then he is the new master 
and the master is the new bulldog and the game goes on as before. 
If the bulldog can get back to the master without being caught, 
he is the new master and the master is the new bulldog. Numbers 
from I to 15 may be used instead of colors. - 
Have You Seen My Sheep. 
Players in a circle. One player is chosen as shepherd. He goes 
around the outside, taps a player on the back, and asks, ‘Have you 
seen my sheep?’ The player asks, ‘How is he dressed?” The 
shepherd then tells something of the dress of one of the players in 
the circle, as—‘‘He wears a blue coat and low shoes.” The player 
questioned tries to guess, as details are added to the description. 
When he guesses correctly the shepherd says “‘yes”’ and the guesser 
chases the one described. Both must run on the outside of the circle.
-P-A-G-E-103
  TAG GAMES 91 
If the chaser catches the runner before the latter has returned to 
his place, the chaser becomes shepherd; if he does not, the runner 
becomes shepherd. Notice that the shepherd does not run. This 
is a good game for a hot day, when something is wanted to slow up 
the activity. 
i 
/ The Night Before Christmas. / 
Players in a circle. Give each player the name of something 
connected with the story of Santa Claus, as sled, reindeer, snow, 
| fur coat, chimney, Christmas tree, stocking, candy, pop corn, horn, 
\ drum, etc. One chosen to be “‘it’’ must stand in the center and tell 
\.a Christmas story. Whenever he mentions the name of any of 
these things, the one who has that name must turn around; if the 
name of Santa Claus is mentioned all must turn around. Any 
player who can be tagged by the one who is “it” before he has 
turned completely around, must be “‘it”” and go on with the story. 
The circle must be of the right size to make this game successful. 
If seats are available the players may sit, and then, of course, the 
circle should be larger. 
GROUP Ill 
In the games of this type all the players are kept on the alert by 
a rule to the effect that the runner may shift his liability to be tagged 
to another player by some device, which varies with the different 
games. In one or two cases other players may take his place if 
they wish to do so. The rule that any player tagged instantly 
becomes the chaser and the one who caught him becomes the runner, 
prevents any lag in the speed of the play. 
Cap Tag, Dumb Bell Tag, Token Tag, etc. 
Players scattered about the playing space. Choose a player to 
be “it” and hand some small object to another player. One can be 
tagged only while touching the object. The game is given different 
names according to the object used. The chaser tries to tag the 
runner, who runs or passes the object to some other player, who 
must not refuse it. If the object is dropped, the chaser may take 
it and then the one who touched it last is “it.” Anyone tagged 
while holding it is “it.” The player who was chaser becomes 
runner when he gets the object and must pass it or is liable to 
be tagged.
-P-A-G-E-104
92 THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
Circle Ball. 
Players in a circle; the one who is “it” stands within. The 
players in the circle have a basketball which they toss from one to 
another to keep it away from the one within, who tries to get it or to 
tag someone who has it. If he can get the ball or tag a player who 
has it, he is runner, and the one tagged or the last one touching the 
ball is “it.” This game requires careful umpiring. If it proves too 
difficult for the one within the circle to tag anyone, let two players 
be “it” at the same time. If there are 30 players or more, it will be 
better to divide and have two games, 
Fox and Squirrel. 
Players arranged in groups of fours as in ‘Squirrels in Trees.” 
There must be an odd squirrel and also another player who is the 
fox. The fox chases the odd squirrel, who can escape the danger by 
going in a tree, since foxes cannot go there. But a tree will hold 
only one squirrel, hence the squirrel in a tree must run out as soon 
as a second one enters, and the fox has one squirrel to chase all the 
time. Any squirrel tagged by a fox, when out of a tree, instantly 
becomes a fox, and the fox then becomes a squirrel and must 
run away and get in a tree to avoid being caught. Circles or marks 
on floor may be used for trees when numbers are small. 
This game is often called “Hound and Rabbit.” 
Partner Tag. 
Players seated. Choose a chaser and a runner. Runner may 
become free by taking a seat with another player, or touching his 
chair; this player must then jump up and be runner. If the chaser 
tags the runner, the latter at once becomes chaser and must tag 
the one who caught him, if possible. Notice that this is much like 
“Fox and Squirrel” but less dramatic. This is more difficult when 
played with the players standing in couples in an open space, the 
couples in a line or in irregular positions. In this case the way to 
escape is to grasp the arm of one player of a couple, and the partner 
of that player then becomes runner. 
Posture Tag. 
Played like “Partner Tag,” but runner and chaser carry a bean- 
bag on the head without using hands to keep it in place. When the 
runner puts the beanbag on any other player’s head, that player 
becomes runner.
-P-A-G-E-105
  TAG GAMES 93 
Three Deep. 
Players form a circle, count off by twos, and each number one 
steps behind the player at his right. This quickly gives a double 
circle, players facing center. Choose one for a chaser and another 
for a runner. The play is like ‘Partner Tag.” The runner may 
run around or between the players and become safe by going in 
front of any group of two and remaining there, thus forming one 
group that is “three deep.” The chaser can tag the rear one of 
any group that is three deep. The player who finds himself at the 
rear of a group of three, should hasten to go in front of a group 
before the chaser can tag him. One who is tagged at once be- 
comes chaser, and should tag the one who caught him if possible. 
Discourage long runs and encourage quick changes instead. 
When numbers are small there may be but one in a place and 
the rear player may be caught where there are “‘two deep,” instead 
of three deep, 
Last Man. 
Players seated at desks. Rows playing must be full rows. The 
game is much like “Fox and Squirrel.” One player is “it”? and 
there is one runner, besides the full rows of seats. The runner 
may come to the front of any row and call “Last Man,” and then 
each player in that row must move back one place, leaving the 
front seat for the runner, who is now safe. The last one in the 
rear of the row will be out of a place and thus becomes runner. 
When a runner is tagged, he is “it,” and the one who caught him 
becomes runner and must get out of the way at once. 
Third Man. 
Played much like ‘“‘Three Deep,” but is more difficult. Players 
standing in couples, facing each other, couples scattered in any 
way about the room. The runner is free from being tagged when 
he steps between the two players of any couple, and the chaser 
must chase the one toward whom the runner turns his back. Rules 
otherwise like “Three Deep.” 
Cross Tag. ; 
Players scattered about. One is:chosen to be “‘it.” He names a 
player whom he will chase, and chases him until he can tag him, 
unless some other player crosses the line between runner and 
chaser. When this occurs the chaser must begin to chase the one 
 
-P-A-G-E-106
ee ae en ee er Ney aE een nC rere en 
94 THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
who crossed and continues until another one crosses.. Whoever 
is tagged is ‘‘it’”’ and the game begins anew. 
GROUP IV 
In games of Group IV all players are equally liable to be tagged, 
but there is usually some way to become exempt, either by going into 
a space where the chaser may not come, or by assuming some place 
or position agreed upon, as making one free from liability to be 
tagged. In several cases it lies within the player’s choice to be 
active or comparatively quiet. Any player tagged when not exempt 
at once becomes “‘it’”” and the game goes on without delay. 
Scat. 
The players form a line facing front. One is the “Teacher” 
and stands a few feet away. She goes through certain exercises, 
the class following. Suddenly she cries “Scat,” and all run to 
the “Home,” a place marked off at the one end of the room, the 
teacher chasing them. If one is caught, she becomes teacher. If 
no one is caught, the same teacher takes her place again. 
The King’s Land. 
Mark a space for the King’s land and select a player to be 
King. The other players try to tease and annoy the King by 
stepping on his land; then he tries to tag them. One who is 
tagged becomes King and the game continues. For a variation the 
players sometimes join hands and march up toward the King, who 
is seated on his throne, keeping step with the words: 
“T’m on the King’s Land, the King’s not at home, 
“The King cannot catch me till I say ‘Come!’ ” 
At the word “‘Come,”’ the King gives chase. 
Old Mother Witch. 
All the players chase after the witch, poking, pulling and teasing 
her in every possible way as she walks along. As they follow 
after her they call: “Old Mother Witch fell in the ditch, picked 
up a penny and thought she was rich.”” The witch then turns and 
asks, ‘‘Whose children are you?” Any name may be given and 
the witch goes on, but if they should say, “Yours,” the witch gives 
chase and the first one caught takes her place. 
The children are not so apt to want to be caught in this game 
because of the teasing the witch has to endure.   +

  TAG GAMES 95 
Twelve o’Clock at Night. 
Mark off a fox’s den in one corner and a chicken yard in another. 
Choose a player to be the fox and another to be the mother hen. 
The rest of the players are chickens. The mother hen arranges 
the chickens in a compact group and then leads them up close to the 
fox’s den and inquires: “If you please, Mr. Fox, what time is it?” 
If he replies any hour except midnight, they are safe and may play 
about; the hen lets them play a moment and then gets them together 
again and, standing between them and the fox, asks the time again. 
When he replies “Twelve o’clock at night,” they must run to the 
chicken yard, and the fox tries to tag one. The fox chooses a 
fox for next time, the mother hen chooses another player in her 
place, and the game begins as before. 
Japanese Tag. 
Players scattered about. One who is “it” tries to tag someone. 
The one tagged must place his hand on the spot where he was 
tagged and in this position try to tag someone else. Continue in 
same manner. 
Squat Tag. » 
Choose one player to be “it.” Players stand scattered about. 
The one who is ‘“‘it” tries to tag players, and they are free from 
being tagged as long as they hold a squatting position (knees bent). 
When the one who is “it” is not near they stand up again. Each 
player may use this way three times to escape being tagged, and 
then can escape only by running. Anyone who is tagged is “it” and 
the game is repeated, 
Statue Tag. 
This is like Squat Tag, except that the one who is “‘it” begins 
by showing a posture to be taken by the players. This may be any 
gymnastic position or a position taken in any sport or occupation. 
To escape tagging, the players may assume this posture, but as in 
Squat Tag, each may do so but three times, and then he may be 
tagged. The first one tagged is “‘it,”” and may set a new posture to 
be taken. 
Hang Tag. 
Played like Statue Tag, except that freedom from being tagged 
can be secured only by hanging from some support by the arms

  96 THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
and lifting the feet from the floor. Desks and seats can serve 
as supports in the schoolroom, but the game is more satisfactory 
in a gymnasium where there are bars, rings and other apparatus. 
Wood tag, iron tag, and tree tag are similar. 
Duck on the Rock. 
Draw a throwing line near the side of the playing space, drive 
a stake in the ground 20 feet from it, and draw a square 12 feet 
on a side so that the stake is in its center. If indoors, a basket ball 
or an Indian club is used instead of the stake. Each player has a 
beanbag. 
The first play is to decide who shall be “‘it.”” Each player stands 
behind the throwing line and throws his bag toward the stake. 
When all are thrown, the one whose bag lies farthest from the stake 
igsits 
The one who is “it” places his bag on the stake and the others 
stand behind the throwing line and throw their bags, trying to 
dislodge this bag. Each player, after throwing, tries to regain his 
bag, but as soon as anyone enters the square and touches his bag, he 
may be tagged until he gets outside of the square. Unless tagged 
within the square a player may go back to the throwing line and 
throw again. If the bag belonging to one who is “‘it” is knocked 
off the stake, he must replace it before he can tag anyone. When 
the one who is “‘it” tags another player, that one is “it,” and must 
put his own bag on the stake before he can tag anyone. This gives 
all the players whose bags are in the square, including the one who 
was “‘it” before, time to get their bags and reach the free territory. 
If two bags are thrown so that they lie touching each other, 
the owners may get them without being tagged. 
If any player throws at the stake with either foot in front of the 
throwing line, he may be declared “‘it.” 
Stand Ball. 
Players scattered about an open playing space. The teacher 
tosses up a basket ball, volley ball, or indoor baseball and calls the 
name of a player. That player runs and gets the ball and the others 
run as far away as possible in the space. As soon as the first player 
gets the ball he calls ‘‘Stand,” and all must stop; the one with the 
ball must stop also, and roll the ball at the others from where he 
picked it up. No player may move a foot to escape being hit; if he 
does, or if he is hit, he is “it” and gets the ball, tosses it up, calls 
“Stand,” and in all ways does as the first one did. As soon as one is
-P-A-G-E-109
  TAG GAMES 97 
hit the others are free to run away until he gets the ball and calls 
“Stand.” If no one is hit the same player must go after the ball and 
be “it” again. The ball must be rolled, not thrown at the players, 
unless all are equally large and strong, when throwing may be 
allowed if all agree to it. 
GROUP V 
We now have, for the first time, games involving simple codpera- 
tion in place of the complete individualism of the previous games. 
These games differ a little on account of the playing space, but 
mostly in the dramatic features of the play. 
Pom Pom Pull Away. 
This is probably the most widely known and universally played 
of all the games of children. It is known in various countries by 
various names, including Hill Dill, Rushing Bases, Caesar’s Army, 
King Senio, etc. 
A considerable space is marked off at each end of the playing 
space for goals or bases; the space between is where most of the 
play takes place. The one who is “it” stands in the middle ground 
and calls, “Pull Away,” or some other phrase that is understood, 
and all of the players, who have taken places in one of the goals, 
must in answer to the call, run across to the other goal. All those 
tagged join the original tagger and help to tag the rest, who must 
run across again when the call is repeated. The game continues ‘ill 
all are caught, when the first one tagged is “it” for the next game. 
Black Tom. 
Played like Pom Pom Pull Away, except as to the call and the 
rules regarding it. 
Mark two lines on floor, dividing playing space into three equal 
parts. One player is “it.” He stands in the middle space and 
the other players in one end. When he calls “Black Tom” three 
times all the other players must run through the middle space to the 
other end, and he tags as many as he can. If they do not start 
promptly he can go after them and can tag them at any time until 
they reach the other end space. All who are tagged must now 
go in the middle space and help catch the others. Only the one 
who was “it” at first can call the players legally, and if any of 
them run into the middle space when anyone else calls or when any 
other call is given than “Black Tom,” they are considered as caught 
 
-P-A-G-E-110
  98 THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
without being tagged. The one who is “it” may call “Red Tom” or 
“Blue Tom,” and such calls must not be counted toward the three 
calls. When all are caught another game begins with the first one 
caught as “‘it.”’ 
This game is sometimes called “The Black Man,” and then the 
call is, ““Who’s afraid of the Black Man?” 
Hill Dill. 
Played like Black Tom, except that the call is “Hill Dill, come 
over the hill, or else [’ll catch you standing still,” and the players 
may start from either side at any time, without waiting for the call. 
There is no attempt to deceive by giving the wrong call. The 
players’ passing in both directions all the time makes it more difficult 
to catch them. 
Giant’s Cave. 
Children on one goal, mother out in front, giant in cave, hidden 
somewhere. 
Children—‘‘Mother, may we go out to play?” 
Mother—“Yes, but don’t go near the giant’s cave.” 
Children run out and play around until mother calls: ‘Children 
come home or the giant will catch you.” 
They all run for the goal and the giant runs out and catches as 
many as he can. Those caught are giants, and the game continues. 
Birds. 
Mark out a nest in one corner and a cage in another, choose two 
bird catchers and a mother bird, and name the other players in 
groups of three or four after kinds of birds. Have the mother bird 
stand at the nest and the two catchers in front of the players, be- 
tween cage and nest. When teacher calls “Robins” or “Quail,” 
the players so named must rise, pass to rear of room, and then try 
to reach the nest and be touched by the mother bird before the 
catchers.can tag them. The bird catchers may not leave their place in 
front until the birds reach the rear of the room. Birds tagged are 
put in the cage. Call one kind at a time; and see whether nest or 
cage has most birds when all have flown. The children will enjoy 
having the bird catchers form a door to the cage with raised arms, 
and all the other players count the birds aloud as they come out. 
Spat ’Em or Oyster Supper. 
The two teams line up facing each other at least 30 feet apart. 
Players of Team A extend one hand. A player chosen from Team
-P-A-G-E-111
  
TAG GAMES 99 
B crosses over to Team A and goes down the line touching each 
hand. When this player decides which member of Team A shall 
be the chaser, that hand is slapped and the player runs back to his 
own line. If the player from Team B reaches his line without being 
tagged, he is safe. If the runner is tagged, he then becomes a 
member of the opposite team. The chaser from Team A then taps 
the hands of Team B and the game continues until time is called. 
The team having the largest number wins. 
Brownies and Fairies. 
Two goals 30 to 40 feet apart; the players in two equal groups 
stand in the goals. One group (fairies) turn backs while the others 
(brownies) creep up as quietly as possible. One fairy is watching 
and when they are near, calls, ‘Look out for the brownies.” The 
fairies then chase the brownies to their goal and tag as many as they 
can. All who are caught are fairies. Then brownies turn backs 
and fairies come up quietly, etc. The side having greatest number 
at end of time wins. 
Colors. 
Name each row a color. Catcher stands in front and calls a 
color. The row called goes to the back and as soon as they get there 
the catcher starts to catch. Runners run anywhere around room. 
As soon as one is caught he tries to catch the others, so that at first 
you have one catcher, then two, then three or more. Last one 
caught is catcher next time. 
Dodge Ball. 
Players in two equal groups. One group forms a circle, other 
group within. Outside group has a volley or indoor baseball with 
which they try to hit the players within. As soon as one is hit he 
must join the circle and help hit the others. When all have been 
tagged in this way, groups change places and repeat. The two 
players who were last to be hit in the two games are captains to 
choose up for next time. Another kind of ball may be used and 
it may be rolled, instead of thrown, if there is danger of injury. 
This game works best with from 7 to 12 players on a side. 
Sheep, Sheep, Come Home. 
One player is the wolf and has a den at one side of the field. 
The mother sheep is in the middle of the field and the sheep are 
at one end.

; 100 THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
The game begins by the mother sheep calling, “Sheep, Sheep, 
come home.” ‘They answer, ‘‘We’re afraid.” 
Mother, “Of what?” 
Sheep, ““The wolf.” 
Mother, “The wolf has gone to Dixieland and won’t be back 
for seven days, so sheep, sheep, come home.” 
The sheep then run to the opposite end of the field, while the 
wolf runs out and catches as many as possible. Those caught go 
to the den to help catch the others and the game is repeated. 
London Loo. 
Played like “Black Tom,” until three or more have been caught; 
and then the catchers must join hands and catch the other players 
while holding an unbroken line. No one can be tagged unless the 
line is complete, and then only by the hands. The end players 
can use their free hands and if the players try to break through, or 
pass under, they can be tagged by the grasped hands.   Fisherman. 
Played like “London Loo,” except that the line of four or more 
catchers must encircle the players as in a net, one enclosed being 
captured as soon as the circle is completed by the end players clasp- 
ing hands and forming a closed circle. , The call is ‘Swim, fishes, 
swim.” 
Black and White. 
Players in two teams of equal numbers and named black and 
white. Draw a line across the middle of the playing space and 
have all the players stand with one toe at this line, ready to jump 
either forward or back as occasion demands; blacks on one side and 
whites on the other side of the line. A disk or coin is tossed into the 
air by the teacher or leader, one side of the disk having been de- 
cided upon as belonging to the black side and the other to the white 
side. When the disk falls the leader looks at it and calls “Black” 
or “White,” according to the side that is up. The team, whose side 
falls uppermost, may tag their opponents, who must get away as 
quickly as possible, to escape capture. There should be a line 
drawn 10 feet away from the center line on each side as a safety 
line, and no one can be caught beyond this line. Those who are 
tagged must come over the line and join the opponents. Then all 
come up to the line, as at first, and the game begins again with a 
toss of the disk. The side that gets all the opponents or that is
-P-A-G-E-113
  TAG GAMES 101 
most numerous when time is up, is the winner. In place of tossing 
a disk the leader may have a card with different colors or names on 
the two sides and suddenly show one side to the players. 
The Flowers and the Wind. 
Divide players into two equal groups and the playing space into 
three equal parts. One side represents the flowers and the other 
side the wind. The flowers meet at their end and the leader, 
appointed by the teacher, chooses a flower they will represent. 
Then they play about in the middle or neutral space until the players 
representing the wind guess the right flower; then all the flowers 
run to their goals and the wind tries to tag them. Flowers caught 
are put ina vase. Repeat until all the flowers have been caught. 
GROUP VI 
These are team games. A player remains loyal to his team, and 
if caught remains a prisoner until released. 
Prison Base. 
Two bases of considerable size should be marked out and two 
prisons. Two teams of equal numbers occupy the bases. The 
object of the game is to make prisoners of the opponents. The 
special rule of play is that any player can tag and thus capture any 
player of the opposing side who left his base earlier; that is, the 
player who has been away from his base longest can be tagged by 
any opponent who has not been away so long. The only way to 
escape being tagged is to run so fast that no opponent can catch 
you or to go back to your base. When one is tagged, the tagger 
can take his prisoner to prison without either being captured. A 
player in prison may be rescued by a teammate who reaches him 
without being tagged and then both are free to return home with- 
out being captured. The success of this game depends much on the 
size of bases and. prisons and their location and distance apart. 
Some authors give diagrams of four or five different types of the 
game. 
Stealing Sticks. 
This is played like “Prison Base,” with the added features of 
stealing sticks. Each team has six sticks, erasers, or other objects 
distributed along the front edge of the goal. If an opponent can 
touch a stick before he is tagged he may take it home to his base.
-P-A-G-E-114
  102 THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
The side getting all its opponents’ sticks wins. The rules of “Prison 
Base” apply in full. 
Every Man in His Own Den. 
Each player marks for himself a den 2 or 3 feet in diameter, 
these dens as far apart as they can have them in the playing space. 
They start on the plan of “Prison Base,” trying to make prisoners 
of one another, but if one is captured he must join his captor in the 
game instead of being a prisoner. The main rule of ‘Prison Base” 
applies: for example, if players 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 leave their 
dens in the order of their numbers, player 1 can be caught by any 
of the others and player 6 can tag any or all of the others he can 
reach; but as soon as player 1 touches his own den again, that makes 
him able to tag any of the others. The play begins by the players 
“making dares” to induce their opponents from their dens; as they 
are captured they form fewer and stronger groups, until finally 
there are two groups of about equal strength or one group that 
rapidly captures all the rest. That player wins who, with his cap- 
tives, finally captures all the rest. 
See also the game “Wolf,” described at the end of chapter 
on Goal Games.

  CHAPTER X 
GAMES OF PERSONAL COMBAT 
Boxing and wrestling are familiar examples of a group of games 
in which personal combat is the main feature. Fencing is a less 
familiar example. All three of these are relics of ancient warfare. 
Other games of the combat type have been devised to satisfy the 
fighting instinct of boys. 
The resemblance of these activities to games is often overlooked, 
since people think of team games as the type and forget that 
tennis singles, checkers and chess are games, although there is but 
one contestant on a side. The essential features of a game, includ- 
ing strategy, deception, and free choice of the manner of attack, 
are conspicuous in combats, making them games rather than simple 
contests. 
Because of the nature of these games, involving personal contact 
as they do, the custom has grown up of classifying the players 
by weight, also of placing a limit on the time. In wrestling and 
boxing there are seven weights for school competition, sometimes 
eight, as in the classification that is given. On the playground, an 
age division at 16 years, making Juniors and Seniors, is made. The 
table below shows these divisions: 
Flyweight 105 Ibs. and under (sometimes 108) 
Bantam 115 
Feather pag i < Light 58° & 
Welter Dag t 
Middle LN tc eee 
Light-heavy Gece e 
Heavy Oven dl 75s . 
The time in regular matches for trained wrestling is set at ten 
minutes for seniors, and six minutes for juniors; if the bout ends 
in a draw (neither contestant having won), additional periods of five 
and three minutes are given respectively. Many teachers prefer 
periods of eight minutes for seniors and five minutes for juniors. 
103
-P-A-G-E-116
  104 THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
When wrestling is used in class work by untrained groups, three 
minutes is long enough, although another period of this length may 
follow a short rest. In professional boxing the time rule is three 
minutes to a round, with one minute between. These times may be 
modified for boys, being cut down to two minutes, or even one. 
The number of rounds in amateur bouts ranges from three to six. 
Both wrestling and boxing demand quick thinking and are fine 
for developmental purposes, as they bring almost all the muscles 
into play. Boxing also requires speed and footwork. Many adults 
find these sports useful in a recreative sense for keeping in good 
physical trim. They are very strenuous, however, and only those 
who are in training should be allowed to enter tournaments. 
Boys can be easily taught the blows, guards and footwork in 
boxing, the holds and breaks in wrestling, and the thrusts and parries 
in fencing. They like these forms of combat, especially during the 
junior and senior high school period of life. It is necessary to have 
gloves for boxing, mats (for safety 20 ft. square) for wrestling, 
and foils, masks, and plastrons for fencing. This equipment is 
expensive if we attempt to conduct the activities with all the boys 
of a school or playground, in most cases expensive enough to make 
it impossible. Larger schools can provide equipment for small 
groups and conduct these sports for the few who wish to engage 
in them. 
The lesser combats described below are interesting to a .ess 
degree but are useful at odd times and for shorter periods when 
more highly organized games cannot be carried out. 
WRESTLING 
Wrestling is a sport practically as old as civilization, and is popu- 
lar with people of all lands. There are many distinctive types, the 
most important of which are the Greco-Roman or European; the 
catch-as-catch-can, prevalent in America; and jiu-jitsu, a novel form 
used by the Japanese. 
In the “Catch-As-Catch-Can” style there are two positions from 
which holds are obtained: standing and kneeling. Because the 
standing holds permit flying falls, which are dangerous, teachers 
who are working with beginning classes will find it more practical 
at first to have the opponents use the kneeling position on the mat, 
as later described. 
In actual-wrestling matches both types of holds are used. The 
competitors stand, facing each other on the mat, and after the signal
-P-A-G-E-117
  
  GAMES OF PERSONAL COMBAT 105 
is given, each tries to get a hold that will be to his advantage. The 
winner must force his opponent on his back so as to make the two 
shoulders touch the mat at the same time, called a pin fall. This 
means that the opponents may lose their standing position and 
fall to the mat without a pin fall being secured. Then the kneeling 
holds are employed to win the match. 
This explains briefly the ‘“‘catch-as-catch-can” wrestling. The 
competitors are allowed to choose any legal hold, the term legal 
being used because there are several dangerous holds that are barred 
in amateur bouts. 
A few of the fundamental principles of holds, first standing, then 
kneeling, will be explained, showing how they are defended against. 
Standing Holds 
First of all, a strong standing position is necessary, one that will 
allow the person to be well braced, and yet permit him to move 
quickly when an opening is presented. This is called the ‘‘on guard” 
position. It is a crouching one, with knees slightly bent and the 
body inclined forward from the waist up. The feet are set well 
apart, pointed outward, and the left in advance of the other. The 
arms are somewhat extended, the left more so. 
From this “on guard” position the two rivals will usually grasp 
each other in the so-called “Referee’s Hold.” This hold is a fair 
one to each opponent, and is the one the referee arbitrarily uses to 
bring both of them together in case there has been needless delay 
in seeking openings. In this hold, each boy places one hand over 
the back of the opponent’s neck, at the same time the other hand 
grasps the other’s near elbow. The feet are well spread and back 
out of reach. 
There are any number of good methods of taking an opponent 
off his feet. A few of the simpler ones follow: 
Arm Drag. 
Grasp opponent’s right elbow with your left hand, turn to the _ 
left, placing right foot outside of his right foot, and slide right 
arm over his right arm, clamping it above the elbow between your 
arm and side. Continue turning to the left and drop to the mat 
as opponent loses his balance, forcing him to land squarely on his 
back or right shoulder. (The break is to step outside aggressor’s 
tripping leg or grasp him under the thigh with your free hand.) 
 
-P-A-G-E-118
106 THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
Head Lock. 
Grasp his elbow and turn, as in the preceding hold, but clamp 
his head between your arm and side, instead of his arm; fall to mat 
as before. (Break—as above, jerking the head backward at the 
same time.) 
Tackle or Double Leg Lock. 
Stoop suddenly and, rushing under opponent’s arms, grasp him 
around the knees as in making a football tackle. Stand erect, lift- 
ing him on your shoulder. Assuming his body is over your right 
shoulder, swing his legs to the left and drop forward and to the 
right, whipping him forcibly to the mat on his back. (Break— 
extend legs backward and spread them, throwing your weight on 
aggressor to force him to the mat under you. A still better way is 
to lean over opponent’s shoulder and grasp him around the waist 
with both arms.) 
Front Waist Lock. 
Push upward on opponent’s elbow, with one hand, and at the 
same time place other hand under jaw and push head back. This 
makes an opening to grasp him around the waist, your shoulders 
against his chest and forearms across the small of his back. Con- 
tinue advancing with your shoulder, at the same time drawing the 
lower part of his body under you, and force him backward to the 
mat. After practice, combine this with a leg trip. (Break—jump 
quickly backward and throw weight forward; place open hand 
against aggressor’s chin and push his head upward and backward.) 
Rear Waist Lock. 
The opening may be made in the same way as for the front waist 
lock. Another way is as follows: With your left hand push 
opponent’s right elbow forcibly across his chest, turning his body 
toward the left. Step in rapidly to a position behind him and 
grasp him around the waist. From this position you can raise him, 
and swinging his legs to the side as in the double leg lock, whip him 
to the mat. A method requiring less effort is to turn sideward 
and drop to the mat, pulling him backward over your extended 
leg. The rear lock is not so apt to end in a fall, but useful only 
to bring opponent to the mat. (Break—grasp aggressor’s fingers 
and force his arms apart, stepping forward away from him. If 
he attempts to lift you twine leg around his leg.)
-P-A-G-E-119
  GAMES OF PERSONAL COMBAT 107 
Mat Holds 
On the mat, the defensive man is usually upon his hands and 
knees. It is advisable to turn the feet inward and flex the legs 
sufficiently so that you are practically sitting upon your feet, with 
the knees spread rather far apart. The elbows are bent and kent 
fairly close to the sides, but the hands are placed wider than the 
shoulders. The head should not be allowed to droop. This insures 
a low substantial position, from which you will not be easily dis- 
lodged, and which in itself protects you from the more dangerous 
holds. The aggressor may assume a variety of positions dependent 
upon the hold he is seeking, but space will not permit a detailed 
description here. 
Nelsons. 
The holds most commonly used on the neck are the Nelsons, and 
chiefly the half Nelson on the near side. Assuming the aggressor 
is to the opponent’s right side and facing in the same direction, the 
near half Nelson is secured by passing the right arm under his right 
arm, the forearm passing upward in front of his shoulder so that 
the hand may be placed on the back of the under-man’s head. By 
raising slightly and straightening the arm the opponent’s right 
shoulder is forced upward and his head downward, so that he is 
thrown over onto his left shoulder or back. The half Nelson is 
always used in combination with some other hold, for example, 
reaching beneath the chest with the left arm, grasping his crotch 
or farther leg at the knee, etc. The quarter or bar, three-quarter 
and full Nelsons are modifications of this fundamental hold. 
(Break—depress the shoulder, bring the arm close to the side and 
push the head backward; keep low and extend the opposite arm 
and leg sideward to afford a wider base. Also, a good way is to 
roll left shoulder backward, grasping for a backhanded hold with 
the left arm; at the same time clamp his right arm tight to your 
side to keep him from releasing it.) 
Scissors. 
Probably next in importance to the Nelsons are the scissors holds, 
in which some part of the opponent is imprisoned between the thighs 
of the aggressor, the feet being crossed to assist in applying pres- 
sure. When applied to the head or body, this can be made a very 
painful hold and may force the opponent to yield even when his 
shoulders are not touching the mat. One of the best methods of 
 
-P-A-G-E-120
  108 THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
securing the body scissors is to first obtain a half Nelson on the near 
arm, then straddle him and throw your weight in the direction your 
half Nelson is forcing him. As he turns over, lock your legs 
tightly around his body and, encircling his head with your free arm, 
hold it firmly against your chest. Keep his arm and head locked 
and apply pressure with the scissors. (Break—the safest and 
simplest break is to force the aggressor’s legs apart with your arm 
or leg.) 
This should give a general idea of a few of the fundamental 
positions and holds of wrestling. In case the beginner desires to 
practice other holds, it is highly advisable to do so under the direc- 
tion of a capable instructor, as serious injuries are quite liable to 
result from unsupervised wrestling by inexperienced men. 
Minor Wrestling Combats 
In the “Side Hold” the two boys stand side by side, facing oppo- 
site directions, each grasping the other around the body with one 
arm. The taller boy puts his arm over the shorter boy’s shoulder 
and, reaching across his back, grasps his opposite arm. The shorter 
boy takes hold in the same way, except that his arm goes back under 
the taller boy’s arm. They grasp the free hands toward the front 
and try by bending, lifting, and tripping, to throw one another. 
In the ‘Square Hold” each boy grasps his opponent’s arms, one 
near the shoulder and the other near the elbow, and the two wrestle 
facing each other. The boy wins who makes the other lose his feet 
or lose his hold. 
The side hold can be modified so that both boys put one arm 
over the other’s shoulder and lock hands behind the back. This 
style is called\‘Cumberland Wrestling,” with the object to lift 
the opponent clear of the ground. 
“Collar and Elbow Wrestling.”—Here the object is to make 
the opponent touch the ground with any part of the body other 
than the feet. The left hand is placed back of the opponent’s neck 
and the right hand grasps the opponent’s left elbow. The opponent 
takes the same hold. The feet can be used to trip up the opponent 
and make him lose his balance. 
, The “Indian Wrestle” is begun with the two opponents lying 
on their backs on the floor with heads in opposite directions, trunks 
close and near arms locked at the elbows. Three counts are given; 
on one each boy lifts his limb nearest the opponent to vertical 
position; on two he brings it back to the floor; on three he lifts it

again as on one and, crossing it over his opponent’s knee, tries to 
tip him over backward. _, 
In the “Hand Wrestle” the opponents grasp right hands, stand 
facing each other and place their right feet so that they touch along 
the outside edges. Then each one places the left foot a pace to the 
rear, so as to give a firm gracing position. At the word ‘‘Go” each 
one tries to force the other off balance. The first to move a foot 
loses the bout. 
“Wand Wrestling” begins with the two opponents facing each 
other and both grasping a wand with both hands, the hands from a 
foot to eighteen inches apart. At the word each tries to upset the 
balance of the other or make him lose hold of the wand. Letting 
go with either hand or moving either foot, loses the bout. 
“Sparrow Fight.”—Here a six foot circle is drawn and two 
boys sit on the floor within it, with knees flexed and hands clasped 
around ankles. A wand is thrust through above the arms and 
under the knees. Now each tries to crowd the other out of the 
circle or tip him over backward. 
“Cock Fight.”—The boys fold their arms and lift one foot to 
rear; each bumps the other with the folded arms and tries in this 
way to crowd him from the circle, force him off balance or to 
unfold his arms. 
“Rooster Fight.””—This is like cock fight, except that each boy 
grasps his own left foot with his right hand and his right arm with 
his left hand. 
“Chicken Fight” is like the last, except that each boy bends 
forward and grasps his own ankles, then tries to shoulder his 
opponent out of circle or off balance. 
“Pull the Stick”’*is taken while sitting on the floor with feet 
against feet of opponent and both grasping a stick with both hands. 
Each tries to lift the other or make him break hold, using a straight 
and steady pull. 
The “Badger Pull” is taken with the boys on hands and knees, 
heads toward each other, and a strap or band around both heads. 
The one who lets the band slip from his head or moves from his 
position, loses the bout. 
BOXING 
Boxing is too intricate a sport to be described in more than a 
general way. It takes long experience to master the more scientific 
details of offense and defense, and the beginner should concentrate
-P-A-G-E-122
  IIo THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
on perfecting the fundamental principles that are taught him. A 
correct start is all important. 
The first thing to learn is how to strike properly. With this 
advantage, beginners will avoid injuries to the hands. It is im- 
portant, when striking a blow, to have the thumb bent against the 
front of the clenched fingers; also to hit with the hand making a 
continuous line with the forearm as it strikes. 
Next it is important to learn the proper boxing position. This 
is one in which the left foot is extended and pointed almost straight 
ahead. The right foot is also pointed forward, but to the right 
at the same time, and the heel is raised so that the weight is on the 
ball of the foot. The two feet are a foot to a foot and a half 
apart, giving the person a well-braced position. Most boxers as- 
sume a slightly crouching attitude. The position of the arms is 
as follows: The right arm is bent, with the fist brought past the 
center of the chest, and in a position to protect either heart or chin; 
the elbow is low and kept close to the body, ready to block many 
of the body blows. The left arm is extended forward toward the 
opponent’s chin, with the forearm inclined slightly upwards. Both 
palms face downward. The body is bent at the waist so that the 
head and right shoulder drop slightly and the latter slants slightly 
away from the opponent. 
From this position many blows can be made, but the two that are 
most fundamental and which every beginner should learn first, are 
the straight left jab and the right cross. 
The straight left jab is a very important blow in boxing. It 
is carried both to the opponent’s face and body. A step forward 
is made with the left foot, a push being made off the ball of the 
right foot. If the blow is carried through effectively, the right 
foot will drag forward although holding to the floor; if not car- 
ried through, the boxer may step back with the left foot so that 
the position is the same as the one started from. As the straight 
left is made, the right hand is maintaining a defensive position. 
This permits a block for your opponent, who may strike either over 
or under your extended left arm; and also a chance for a follow-up 
blow with the right hand if there is an opening. 
This blow is parried by a block with the protecting right hand, 
again by slipping the head to the side, or by stepping back with the 
right foot, inclining the head and the body back, thereby causing 
the opponent’s blow to fall short.
-P-A-G-E-123
  GAMES OF PERSONAL COMBAT It 
The blow just described is useful in winning bouts on points, as 
the opponent may be reached often, even though not for a hard 
blow. The second blow mentioned above, the right cross, is a 
dangerous one that carries much force behind it. It is usually suc- 
cessful when the opponent has made a left jab to the body. The 
right cross is made over the opponent’s left arm and driven against 
his chin. This blow is often used to follow up a feint with the 
straight left, after the opponent has countered. Beginners are first 
taught to use the right cross to the opponent’s head. There is, 
however, another blow frequently made with the right hand, which 
is called the straight right. The difference is that this blow goes 
under the opponent’s left arm instead of over it as does the right 
cross, and is delivered straight-away to the body or chin. 
The most successful defense to the right cross blow is to duck 
the head, keeping the chin low, and raising the left shoulder at the 
same time to ward off the blow or change it into a glancing one. 
Another blow frequently employed is the uppercut. This is 
usually delivered at close quarters. It is started lower than usual 
and the force is carried upward, usually to the opponent’s chin or 
solar plexus. The man delivering this blow raises on his toes at 
the moment of landing, so as to put the weight of the body behind it. 
The blows commonly known as hooks are delivered with either 
hand, but from a sidewise position with the arm curved considerably. 
There is one defensive safeguard that applies to all situations, 
and that is, always keep the chin down when advancing. 
When the two men get ahold of each other, as in wrestling, what 
is known as a “clinch” results. No striking is allowed during a 
clinch. The referee orders the two men to fall apart. As they 
do so, each man tries, as a protective measure, to keep his arms out- 
side of the opponent; holding the latter’s forearms together, so 
as to prevent a blow being struck while at close quarters. 
The equipment for boxing is a pair of gloves to cover the hands. 
These are found 6, 8, 10 or 12 ounces in weight; the lighter being 
used by professionals and the heavier being prescribed by teachers 
for use by beginners. A thing that is helpful in practicing the blows 
by oneself, is an inflated striking bag that is suspended from a low 
ceiling. This bag allows the boxer to practice all the blows that 
are used, dodging when the bag rebounds. 
Another way in which the boxer practices alone is by the sisal 
of “shadow boxing,” in which he practices against an imaginary 
 
-P-A-G-E-124
Saab a a i ie i ah wo id A a ne a 
112 THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
opponent, following him around the ring, leading, feinting, counter- 
ing, and dodging, as the case may be. This is very vigorous, but 
an excellent developer of footwork. 
Boxing can be taught to a whole class, the various blows and 
guards being practiced at command before any attempt is made 
to pair members off for real competition. The teacher shows how 
to make a certain blow or thrust, which he names, and has each 
member of the class try to make the movement, all working in 
unison. Then the members can be paired off and numbered by 
ones and twos and the blows and the guards practiced by command, 
much as before. Finally, as many as have gloves can practice at 
“sparring,” the name applied to boxing when no effort is made to 
inflict injury with any of the blows. 
It is a foul to strike a blow “below the belt,” as it is called. 
There are many other fouls, which, in general, prohibit striking 
the opponent with any part of the body other than the fists. In 
professional boxing, where knockouts are attempted, the most vul- 
nerable places to land are the chin, the heart region, and the spot 
over the stomach, known as the “solar plexus.” 
  Minor Boxing Combats 
The minor boxing combats are of the novelty order. Mounted 
boxing is one of them. The rider sits on the shoulders of his 
partner (the horse) and clamps his feet together, back of the horse. 
The horses maneuver while the riders box. The bouts are of one 
minute duration, the decision going to the horse and rider that can 
upset the other. Another method is to have the rider sit astride 
his partner’s hips. Another combat is boxing on barrels, in tilt 
fashion, the object being to dislodge the opponent. 
Fencing 
This activity is quite popular in Europe, where it has been 
handed down from the middle ages, when it was the sport of the 
knights. In America it is occasionally found taught in college 
gymnasiums, blunt foils being used. Fencing can be practiced by 
a whole class, the same as in boxing. After the various thrusts 
and parries have been explained and demonstrated, the class (indi- 
vidually) attempts them at the word of command. Then the mem-
-P-A-G-E-125
  GAMES OF PERSONAL COMBAT | 113 
bers can be paired off, and as many as have foils and masks practice 
against each other. 
The bayonet type of fencing developed to a high degree of 
technique during the war. 
The tilt is a novelty contest in which each competitor uses a pole, 
padded at the end, and tries to upset the opponent, who is sta- 
tioned in a canoe; or, if on land, upon some unstable object like a 
barrel from where it would be easy to lose one’s balance,

  CHAPTER XI 
TEAM GAMES—BASEBALL TYPE 
This group of games includes the American game of Baseball, 
the English game of Cricket, and several minor games based on 
these two, but suited to younger players, to smaller space, and to 
varying numbers. 
Origin of the Games. 
Modern games of bat and ball have been developed by com- 
bining an ancient ball play, much like Golf, with the use of bases 
or goals and the practice of tagging; both of these are prominent 
features of the games of children. An old game of English 
children called “Four Corners,” suggests what may have been the 
starting point in the evolution of these games. “Four Corners” 
is nothing more or less than the ancient game of “Pussy Wants a 
Corner,” with one addition; the out-player has a small, soft ball, 
which he tosses to any one of the players on the bases; the player 
to whom it is tossed strikes at the ball with the open hand, and 
then, whether he hits or not, each player must run to the next base. 
The out-player picks up the ball as quickly as possible and tries to 
hit a runner with it before he reaches a base. Hitting a player with 
a thrown ball is a form of tag common in many simple games. 
A century ago English boys were playing an outdoor game 
much like this, which they called “Feeder.” There were several 
bases in a circular course and the batsman sometimes used a small 
club. An odd feature of the game was the fact that all the players 
were “in” but one, which makes it much like the individual tag 
games. 
Next came the regular use of the bat. American boys at the 
time of the Revolution often played a game similar to One Old 
Cat, using a soft ball and tagging the runner either by touching 
him with the ball in hand or by throwing it at him and hitting him 
with it. This developed into the game of Rotation with three, four 
and sometimes five bases. About 1830, players began to form 
permanent teams and play match games under the name of base- 
114
-P-A-G-E-127
  
TEAM GAMES—BASEBALL TYPE 11S 
ball. In the seventies the improvement in the manufacture of 
balls resulted in the making of a ball so hard that the earlier 
method of hitting a player to tag him had to be dropped. Up 
to this time the pitcher was allowed only to toss the ball to the 
batsman, but after 1875 throwing was permitted. This soon led 
to the use of masks, gloves, and breast protectors, and caused the 
pitcher’s base to be moved farther away from the batsman. 
Cricket is believed to have arisen from an ancient game called 
“Stool Ball,” played in England in the Middle Ages. In Stool 
Ball one player, who was said to be “‘in,” stood by a three-legged 
stool, which he tried to protect while the other players threw the 
ball at it. The in-player made a score for every time he hit the 
ball with his hand. If an out-player hit the stool or caught a hit 
ball, he went in, in place of the other. Later the in-player used a 
bat, and still later the stool was replaced by a crude form of 
wicket, which has gone through several stages before reaching the 
modern form. 
Cricket matches were played with permanent teams early in the 
seventeenth century, and it became a common school game early 
in the nineteenth century. 
We see from this historical sketch that while the games of bat 
and ball arose from the combining of elements that are very old, 
the games as such are distinctly modern; in fact they are more 
recent than tennis, hockey, or football. 
BASEBALL 
The game of baseball is played by two teams of nine men, one 
of which, called the side at bat, attempts to score runs by batting 
a pitched ball safely beyond the reach of the opponents, called the 
fielding side. The person who reaches a base, of which there are 
four, placed in diamond shape, can advance when a succeeding 
teammate hits the ball, or by other means later described. A score 
is made when a runner, going counterclockwise, has succeeded in 
touching all four bases. The side in the field attempts to get the 
batter or base runner out by various means. There are rules gov- 
erning the changing of the two teams so that the one at bat takes the 
field, and vice versa. 
The players of a side must all bat in turn, and then they start 
from the beginning again. The players in the field station them- 
selves so as to have one man pitch the ball to the batter, and 
another man to catch the.balls that the batter does not hit; also 
9

  116 THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
to have four men to protect the bases, and to have the remainder 
protect against long hits that go past the bases. 
As the ball is hard, and can be driven with great force, the 
players need gloves to protect the hands.

The Field. 
Baseball needs a level field 325 feet square, but it is often played 
on a smaller space. A square, whose sides are go feet, is marked 
out on the field and is called the ‘‘diamond.’’ Opposite one corner 
of the diamond and 90 feet (or less) from it is placed a “backstop,” 
which is a wide frame covered with boards or wire netting to stop 
balls that get past the catcher. At the corner of the diamond, 
nearest the backstop, is a slab of wood or rubber set even with 
the top of the ground and called the “home plate.” ‘The other 
corners of the diamond are called first, second and third bases, 
starting to the right from the home plate; and each of these is 
marked by a canvas bag 15 inches square, fastened by an iron 
stake that is entirely under ground. In the middle of the diamond, 
60% feet from home plate, is the pitcher’s plate, a slab of rubber

on which he stands before delivering the ball to the batter. The 
official diamond for Junior boys under 16 has baselines 82 feet 
and a pitching distance of 50 feet. There is an official Junior 
ball also, one that is slightly smaller. : 
Scoring. 
A “run” is a complete circuit of bases, whether made all at once 
or in stages. The score is the number of runs made by each team. 
The team making the largest score in nine “innings” wins the game. 
When each team has had a turn “at bat,” it is called one inning; 
a side remains at bat until three men have been “‘put out.” If the 
score at the end of nine innings is a tie, play continues until one 
team has a greater score than the other in equal innings. When 
weather or any other cause stops the game before nine innings 
are played, the score at the end of the last complete inning is taken 
as the final score, provided that at least five innings have been 
played. 
Teams. 
Each team consists of nine men. The teams have turns at bat in 
alternation, which team shall bat first being decided by the captain 
of the home team. The players of the side at bat occupy the players’ 
bench (see diagram), except one man who is batting, others who 
may be on bases, and one or two who are allowed to stand on the 
outer sides of the diamond to “coach” the base runners. The other 
team is in the field trying to prevent the team at bat from making 
runs. The diagram indicates the approximate positions of the 
men in the field. 
Officials. 
The officials of the game are an umpire and a scorer. The 
scorer keeps a list of the men of each team in their order of batting, 
as fixed by the captains, and keeps a record of the game according 
to the decisions of the umpire. The umpire makes all decisions, 
including such as the following: whether the ball is properly de- 
livered by the pitcher; whether a batted ball is fair or foul; whether 
a batter or base runner is out or safe; and whether a run shall be 
scored. Sometimes there are two umpires, one to decide points 
at the home plate and the other at the other bases. 
Strikes and Balls. 
The first man at bat takes his place beside the home plate, 
facing the pitcher, with a bat in his hands. The umpire may stand 
 
-P-A-G-E-130
118 THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
behind either the pitcher or the catcher. It is the duty of the bats- 
man to bat the ball thrown by the pitcher, if it is good, and then 
to run to first base as fast as possible. If the batsman strikes at the 
pitched ball and misses it, or if it passes over the home plate at 
a height between the batsman’s knee and shoulder, the umpire 
declares a “strike.” If this occurs three times the batsman is out, 
provided the catcher catches the ball on the third strike. If he 
fails to catch it after the third strike the batsman may run to first 
base, and is safe if he reaches it before the ball is held by an 
opponent touching the base. (This is the general rule. There 
are some exceptions.) If the ball thrown by the pitcher does not 
pass within the limits defining a strike, the umpire declares it a 
“ball.” Four balls entitle the batsman to first base. If the 
pitcher hits the batsman, the batter is given first base, provided he 
tries to avoid being hit, and does not strike at the ball. If the 
pitcher makes a movement as if to deliver the ball to the batsman 
and then does not do so, it is called a “balk”? and each runner (not 
the batter) is advanced one base. 
Fair Hits and Foul Balls. 
If the batsman hits a pitched ball so that it goes forward be- 
tween the lines to first and third base or their extensions (called the 
foul lines), the umpire declares it a ‘‘fair hit,” and the batsman 
becomes a base runner. If the batted ball is caught by a fielder 
before it hits the ground the batsman is out. If it strikes the 
ground and is afterward thrown to first base and caught there 
before the runner reaches it he is out; he may be tagged out before 
reaching first base if it is more convenient to do so. 
If the batsman hits the ball so that it goes anywhere outside of 
the limits of a fair hit, the umpire declares a “foul ball.” Fouls 
count as strikes until two strikes have been called, but are not 
counted afterward unless caught by the catcher. A ball is foul 
if it strikes in the diamond and then rolls out between home plate 
and first or third; it is fair if it strikes out and rolls in. 
If a man makes an entire circuit of the bases on one hit, it is 
called a “home run,” and is considered a remarkable play, but it 
counts only one score. There is a hit where the batter does not 
swing at the ball hard, but. instead pushes the bat forward and 
allows the bat to hit it; this makes the ball drop dead; such a play 
is called a ‘“‘bunt.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-131
TEAM GAMES—BASEBALL TYPE 119 
Base Runners. 
A base runner, occupying any base, may run to the next base 
whenever he thinks that he has time to do so before the opponents 
can throw the ball there to intercept him. If a batsman makes a 
fair hit while a runner is occupying first base, such runner must go 
to second to make room for the batsman. This is called a “forced 
run.” Such a runner need not be tagged, but is out if the ball is 
caught by an opponent on the base before he reaches it. A forced 
play may be made at any base, provided rear bases are occupied. 
If the ball is hit in the air and is caught, then the base runner 
is forced back to the base from which he came, and may be put out 
if the ball reaches the base before he can touch it. Except in the 
above instances, the base runner must be tagged with the ball to be 
put out. In tagging a runner, the fielder must not drop the ball. 
There are a few special cases to be noted: sometimes the base runner 
is permitted to advance to the next base without being put out, as for 
instance, where the umpire calls a balk, where a fielder interferes 
with the runner, or where the batsman is given first base, thus forc- 
ing the other base runners forward; he is required to return to 
the base from which he came, but without liability of being put out, 
however, in the case of a foul hit ball that is not caught. 
Scoring Record. 
Scoring is keeping a record of the game, including the number 
of runs, how such runs were made, and the record of each individual 
player. This is done by means of the following diagram: Symbols 
  are used to show how the player reached 1, which is first base; 
and in the same manner how the player advanced around the bases. 
If a run is scored, it is indicated in the center space. For the pur- 
poses of scoring, each player is numbered as in the diagram of the 
field of play. 
Scorers differ in the use of symbols. The plan above uses B to 
indicate that the runner went to first on four balls; S, that he stole 
second; A-4, that he reached third when second baseman (4) as- 
sisted (A) in retiring a batter; 6-2, that he reached home when 
shortstop (6) threw to catcher (2) too late to stop the score. 
This plan uses H for a hit, 2H for a two-base hit, F-8 for an out 
on a fly to center field, etc.
-P-A-G-E-132
    120 THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
For the purposes of final tabulation, such as appears in the 
newspapers and is known as the “box score,” there are columns 
after each player’s name as in the accompanying diagram. 
op     
AB—At Bat. 
Number of times a player came to bat. Whenever a batter is 
given a base on balls, or is hit by a pitched ball, or makes a sacrifice 
hit, he is not charged with a time at bat. 
R—Runs. 
A run is counted whenever a player legally touches all the bases, 
ending at home plate, before three men of his side are put out. 
H—Hits. 
A safe hit must be a fair hit ball, which is not caught by a 
fielder, or which does not cause the batter to get put out at first 
base, or cause a base runner to be forced; provided, however, that 
the fielder is not at fault in allowing anyone to reach the base 
safely. A hit is also given when a batted ball strikes the umpire or 
a base runner. 
SH—Sacrifice Hits. 
A sacrifice hit is a play in which the batter voluntarily permits 
himself to be put out in order that a teammate may advance a base. 
The most common way to sacrifice is to bunt the ball. 
SB—Stolen Bases. 
Where a runner advances a base without any assistance from 
the batter or through any fault of the opponents. 
PO—Put Out. 
This is credited to the fielder who completes a play which retires 
an opposing player; i.e., catching a fly ball, tagging a runner, etc.
-P-A-G-E-133
  TEAM GAMES—BASEBALL TYPE 121 
A—Assist. 
An assist is given a fielder when he handles the ball in aiding 
to put out a player. 
E—Error. 
An error is charged against a fielder when he makes a misplay, 
like a fumble, or dropping a fly ball. 
Miscellaneous 
How to Compute the Percentage. 
The percentage is ascertained by dividing the games won by the 
total number of games played. 
To Find the Batting Average. 
Divide the total number of hits by the total number of times 
at bat. 
To Find the Fielding Average. 
Divide the total number of putouts and assists by the number of 
chances the player had to field the ball; i.e., the total of putouts, 
assists and errors. 
The idea in figuring out any average is to divide the number of 
successful tries by the total number of tries (including both succes- 
ful and unsuccessful). 
Minor American Games. 
The rules of baseball have been developed by the professional 
baseball leagues, and are too technical and complicated for children. 
American boys and girls play a large number of simpler forms of 
the national game. A few typical games of this sort are as follows: 
Playground or Indoor Baseball. 
Playground ball (Indoor Baseball) resembles regular base- 
ball, but is played on a smaller space with a large soft ball (12 to 
17 inches) and a small bat. The shape of the field and position 
of the players is the same as baseball. Regular teams consist of 
nine men as shown in the diagram, but an extra shortstop and 
extra fielders may be added. The diamond is usually marked out 
with lime on the playground, or on the gymnasium floor with paint. 
The distance between bases may be anything between 27 and 60 
feet, according to conditions and age and size of players. Because
-P-A-G-E-134
  122 THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
of the reduced space and the large ball, three important rules of 
regular baseball are necessarily changed: 1. The ball must be 
pitched underhand; 2. base runners may not steal bases while the 
pitcher holds the ball, but must wait until it has passed the batsman 
(penalty; called back by umpire if not put out); 3. batted balls 
are fair or foul depending on where they strike, without waiting 
for them to roll. Another variation has been the rule not to count 
fouls as strikes, except in the case of foul tips caught by the catcher, 
but the tendency today is to follow baseball in this respect. 
The game is found played with many variations. In Chicago, 
playground ball permits the batter to run either to first or third 
base, unless bases are occupied, in which case he must follow the 
course determined by the first player to reach a base. In Maryland, 
the game is shortened by having the side retired as soon as four 
men have batted. In college intramural systems, where older men 
take part, a small ball (12 inches) is used and the baselines are 
60 feet; the base-running rules are then more like baseball. 
Playground baseball has been very successful, not only with 
boys and girls, but with older people. It requires but little space 
and equipment, is not dangerous, and does not demand a great 
amount of skill nor violent exertion. The player of average ability 
has come to look upon this as his national game, leaving the 
regular baseball to the varsity and professional teams. 
‘Rotation. 
This game is the most popular form of baseball when there are 
not enough players to form regular teams. It is known by several 
names, such as Scrub, Work Up, and Rounders. Instead of two 
teams in which each man has a permanent position, the players 
occupy all the different positions in the field and at bat in rotation. 
When one is out, he goes to the lowest position in the field and 
gradually works up, as other men are put out, through the various 
fielding and base positions, and finally becomes pitcher and then 
catcher, after which he goes in to bat again when the next man is 
put out. Sometimes the game allows the player catching a fly ball 
to exchange places with the batter. The field and the playing 
rules, excepting the variations just described, are the same as for 
the preceding ball games, but there are usually no officials. 
‘One, Two, and Three Old Cat. 
One Old Cat is like “Rotation” in many ways, but it may be 
played by two teams. It is suitable for a smaller number of players,
-P-A-G-E-135
  TEAM GAMES—BASEBALL TYPE 123 
as there is only one base besides the home base. The batsman runs 
to first base and back again to make arun. As more players enter 
the game, two batters are used, but only the first and home bases. 
Sometimes the game is played Three Old Cat, and all the bases used. 
Long Ball. 
This is similar to One Old Cat, but has been planned to play 
indoors, gymnasium mats often serving as bases, and the soft indoor 
ball being used. Every hit is a fair hit, since there are no foul lines. 
The second base, or long base, as it is called, may be in any direc- 
tion, most often directly behind the pitcher. Long ball is usually 
played between two teams of from 3 to 10 players each, but the 
plan of Rotation may be followed. 
ele a gee Diagram for Long Ball 
H, home base; PB, pitcher’s box; LB, long base. 
Runners may be put out by tagging or by hitting them with the 
ball. Any number of players may occupy long base as long as there 
is one of the side left to bat. Their leaving long base is restricted 
in that they cannot return (except fly ball caught) but must keep 
on for home. : 
German Bat Ball. 
Some features of baseball, tennis, and basket ball are introduced 
here. The batsman tosses up the ball and bats it, or there may be 
a pitcher. Usually it is a basket ball or volley ball, batted with 
open hand, without a pitcher. He must then try to make a com- 
plete circuit of the bases without stopping, the opponents trying 
to put him out. He may be put out only by being hit with the ball, 
which he may dodge. The opponents must not run with the ball 
but may pass it from one to another. In the fall of the year it is 
especially fitting to play the game with the batsman kicking the ball 
instead of batting it. 
Hit Pin Baseball. 
A soccer ball is used. Mark out a diamond as large as the 
gymnasium will permit. Make a circle of 3 feet radius for home 
   
-P-A-G-E-136
124 THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
base, and 1 foot squares for the other bases. Stand an Indian club 
in the center of each base. Mark a pitcher’s box as in indoor 
ball. There is no batter’s box. 
The batter stands.in front of the club in home base and kicks 
the pitched ball. The pitcher uses an underhand throw, usually 
called a “toss,” and tries to knock down the club in home base, 
thus putting the batter out. Balls and strikes, fair and foul hits 
are the same as in indoor ball. If four balls are called, the batter 
has a free kick. 
When the batter makes a fair hit he must try to make a complete 
circuit of the bases, running outside the clubs and not knocking them 
down. To put him out the players in the field must pass the ball 
to first, second, third and home bases in order, unless the ball so 
passed, reaches a base before the runner passes it. In doing this 
the players passing the ball must have a foot on the base. If the 
ball gets ahead of the runner and a club ahead of him is knocked 
down with it, he is out. He is also out if he knocks down a club or 
runs inside the base. 
Other rules and details of play as in indoor ball. 
Baseball Played by Girls. 
Through the use of the soft ball there has been a great increase, 
in recent years, in the playing of this type of games by girls. 
Women and girls need the development of the trunk and arm re- 
sulting from throwing and the quick response to a situation that 
baseball games require. The last three forms that have been de- 
scribed are very useful in introducing baseball to girls.

TEAM GAMES—BASEBALL TYPE 125 
Cricket is an English game, played considerably in the Eastern 
part of our country. It is less complicated than Baseball, and 
involves less team play, but it requires quite as much individual 
skill. One point in its favor is that it does not necessitate quite 
so large a field as Baseball. 
In cricket there are two bases sixty-six feet apart. At each 
base is a wicket, which consists of three posts twenty-seven inches 
high, standing so close together that a ball cannot go between. 
On top of the posts are placed two four-inch bits of wood, called 
“bails.” Four feet in front of the wicket (that is, toward the 
other wicket) is a line to limit the position of the batsman. 
The pitcher, who is called a “bowler” in cricket, stands beside 
the wicket and throws the ball to the batsman, who stands in front 
of the other wicket. The object of the batsman is to bat the ball 
and then run to the opposite base. A second batsman stands at the 
other base, and they exchange places. Every hit is a fair hit. The 
batsman must also prevent the pitched ball from striking the 
wicket; if it does, a bail will fall off and then the batsman is out. 
Men are put out by either catching a fly ball or knocking off the 
wicket. Instead of tagging the runner with the ball, the catcher, 
who is called the “wicket keeper,” knocks off the bail with the ball 
in his hand. The two batsman may make two or more runs on 
a hit if they have time, or they may not run if the hit is too short. 
The bat used is a flat one, making it easier to place the ball in 
different directions. The fielders are scattered in various directions 
from the batsman. Eleven men constitute a team, and an inning 
continues until the entire team has batted in turn. This makes the 
game slower than baseball, and since the distance to run is so short, 
the score is much higher, sometimes amounting to several hundred in 
agame. Two innings usually constitute a game.

  CHAPTER XII 
TEAM GAMES—TENNIS TYPE 
Unlike the games of bat and ball, the tennis games seem to 
have little or no resemblance to the elementary games of children. 
They are probably descended from the games of ball played by the 
ancient Greeks and Romans. The oldest tennis games of which 
we know were played in Europe in the Middle Ages, and in 
much the same form as the games are played now. The two 
oldest tennis games are known as “Court Tennis” and “Racquets,” 
and the tennis games of today are derived from these two, falling 
naturally into two groups, known as the net games and the wall 
games. 
Court Tennis. 
Court tennis, the oldest known tennis game, is played in a special 
court having walls of stone, a roof, and galleries for spectators on 
two sides of the playing space. It is the most complex game known; 
and this, in addition to the great expense of building the court, 
keeps it from general use. There are probably twenty of these 
courts in existence, mostly in continental Europe. 
I. THE NET GAMES 
The essential characteristics of the net games are the use of 
a net stretched across the middle of the court, with the opposing 
players on opposite sides of it, and the batting of the balls back 
and forth across the top of the net. 
1. Lawn Tennis 
Lawn Tennis is the most popular of all the tennis games. It 
was devised by Major Wingate, an English army officer, in the 
early seventies. Some of the best elements of court tennis were 
retained and the game was simplified and adapted to outdoor play. 
It rapidly gained favor, and is now played in all civilized countries. 
Lawn Tennis is played with a small ball and a racket on a level 
court. One or two players make a team. The object of the game 
is to bat the ball over a net with the racket, so that it will fall in 
126
-P-A-G-E-139
  TEAM GAMES—TENNIS TYPE 127 
the opponent’s half of the court, and if possible, so that the 
opponent cannot return it. 
The Court. 
As shown in the diagram, the court is divided across its middle 
by a net and includes four service courts, two back courts and two 
alleys. The alleys are used in the double game (two on a side) but 
not in the single game (one ona side),

The Net. 
The net is attached to the posts at a height of 314 feet and 
should be 3 feet high at its center. The full length of one racket 
(27 inches) plus the breadth of the head of another (9 inches), 
gives the exact height for the center. To form right habits of 
play it is important to keep the net just at this height. 
Choice of Side or Serve. 
Sun and wind often make one side preferable and it is usually 
an advantage to serve. Before starting to play one player tosses 
up his racket with a whirling motion and an opponent calls ‘“Rough”’ 
or “Smooth” while it is in the air. (Notice the small thread of 
colored gut woven into the racket near its upper end, so as to be 
rough on one side and smooth on the other.) Let it fall and see if 
the guess is right. If so, the guesser has first choice and may elect 
either to serve or to take a preferred side of the court. The other 
team has a choice of the alternative. 
Serving. 
To begin a game one player tosses up a ball and bats it over the 
net with his racket. This is called serving. He must serve first
-P-A-G-E-140
  128 THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
from the right hand side of the court, standing with both feet 
back of the base line, and must bat the ball so that it will fall in the 
service court diagonally opposite him; if he fails to do this it is 
called a ‘‘fault’”’ and he immediately tries again; if he serves a fault 
twice in succession a point is forfeited to the opponents. He must 
not serve either ball until his opponents are ready; if the opponent 
claims not ready and does not try to return the ball, it must be 
served over again. When the first point has been won or lost the 
same player serves again, this time from the left side, and he con- 
tinues to serve alternately from right and left sides until the game 
is finished. 
Returning the Ball. 
When a ball has been correctly served the player to whom it is 
served must hit it with his racket on the first bound and drive it 
back across the net; in the double game it may fall anywhere in 
the court across the net; in the single game it is not good if it falls 
in an alley. Any player to whom a ball is returned must’ return 
it in like manner, except that returned balls, unlike served balls, 
may be hit before they strike the ground if preferred. This is 
called “volleying.” The ball must not be played until it has passed 
the net; a player touching the net with his body or racket loses the 
point. Play continues with each service until some player fails 
to return the ball—that is, misses it entirely, bats it into the net, 
or “out of court,” or lets it hit him—in which case a point is scored 
for the other side and the server proceeds to serve again. 
The Score. 
A game is won by the side that first wins four points. There is 
one exception to this rule: when the score is three all, that is, each 
side having three, the play is too even to have the game won by a 
single point; in that case one side must win two points more than 
the opponents, as 6-4, I1-9. 
A set is won by the side first winning six games; an exception of 
the same kind occurs here. When the score is 5-all, one side must 
get two more than the opponents to win, as 7-5, 8-6. 
It is customary for the server to call the score each time he takes 
his place to serve; he calls his own score first and that of the 
opponents immediately after, as ‘“‘three-two” or “one-two.” If 
anyone doubts the score as called he should say so at once or it is 
considered as accepted. The server should always take his place
-P-A-G-E-141
  
TEAM GAMES—TENNIS TYPE 129 
to serve, call the score, and then inquire “Ready?” If his opponent 
is ready he answers ‘‘Play,” and the ball is served. 
Let. 
This is an old tennis term meaning that the play counts for noth- 
ing and is to be played over as if it had not occurred. There are 
three cases: 
1. A ball served before the opponents are ready. This cannot 
be claimed if the opponent strikes at the ball as if to return it. 
2. A served ball that touches the top of the net and then goes 
on over and into the proper service court. This is called a “net 
ball” and applies only to served balls. A returned ball doing the 
same thing is good and play goes on. 
3. When a player is prevented from making a play by inter- 
ference from outside, as when a visitor runs across the court, a 
dog seizes a ball, etc., etc. 
Out of Bounds. 
A ball is out of bounds only when it has struck the ground (or 
some permanent fixture) outside the court. If it falls ona line it is 
good, just as if it had fallen within the court. A player stopping 
a ball and claiming that it was going out, loses the point; the same 
thing is true if he allows a ball in play to hit him or his clothing. 
Order of Serving. 
In single games players serve alternately. In double games each 
team may choose which of the two shall serve first, but when this 
is once begun the same order must be kept through the set. In a 
three-handed game the single player serves every other game and 
does not use the alleys, while his two opponents serve alternately 
and play the whole court. 
Points. 
A point is won in any of the following cases: 
1. When an opponent fails to return a ball. 
When an opponent volleys a served ball. 
When an opponent serves a double fault. 
When an opponent allows a ball in play to hit him. 
When an opponent touches the net during play. 
When an opponent strikes a ball before it has passed the net. An eo y
-P-A-G-E-142
130 THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
Matches. 
Usually the team winning two sets out of three wins the match. 
Sometimes, in important cases, as in the finals of a tournament, 
three must be won out of five. 
2. Volley Ball 
Volley Ball was invented in 1895 by William G. Morgan, then 
the director of a Y. M. C. A. gymnasium at Holyoke, Mass. His 
object was to find a game that would keep more players busy on a 
small space than could basket ball, and at the same time be less 
violent and involve less personal encounter. The name is taken 
from tennis and means to hit the ball before it strikes the ground; 
this is the idea of the game—to keep the ball in the air all the time 
by striking it forward and upward by one or both hands. 
Equipment. 
The volley ball is one inch less in diameter than a basket ball, 
and is much lighter, weighing between one-third and one-half as 
much. The field must not be greater in extent than 30 by 60 feet, 
but it may be smaller. A net 8 feet high is stretched tightly across 
the middle of the court. 
Teams. 
For regular match games, the team consists of six players; a 
larger number can play and ten or twelve on a side is better when 
learning to play. The diagram shows the position of players, six 
 
-P-A-G-E-143
  
TEAM GAMES—TENNIS TYPE 131 
on one side and twelve on the other. It is not customary in volley 
ball, as it is in most games, to have the players hold the same 
positions throughout the game; they rotate, shifting to each posi- 
tion in turn, moving forward one place every time their side gets 
a turn at serving. When a player has reached the place indicated 
on the diagram by the highest number, he shifts next time back to 
the rear position indicated by number 1, and becomes server. 
Serving. 
The game begins by a play called serving, in which one player 
takes the ball, stands with both feet behind the back line, as at S 
in the diagram, tosses the ball up slightly and then bats it forward 
toward the net. A player serves only so long as his side wins; when 
it fails to win the point it is “out,” and the opposing side serves. 
The players serve in turn as they get successive innings, the one 
with the highest number serving first, and so on down to number 1. 
Rule for Serving (Boys). 
A served ball must not be touched by another player of that 
side but must go over the net without touching it and fall in the 
opponents’ court—otherwise the serve is lost and the ball goes to 
the opponents, who serve in their turn. 
Rule for Serving (Girls). 
A served ball may be batted by other players of the same side 
to help it along, and it is a good serve if it goes over and falls in 
the opponents’ court, even if it touches the net in passing. If it 
fails to go over the net or strikes the floor out of court it is lost. 
Returning the Ball. 
When the ball is played over the net as provided in the rules, 
the players of the opposing side try to keep it in the air, and to 
bat it back over the net. Play continues in this manner until the 
ball strikes the floor or until, for some reason, the ball is declared 
dead. 
Relaying the Ball. 
When two or more players of the same side hit the ball in turn 
before it goes over the net, it is called “relaying the ball.” This 
adds interest to the game and makes a lot of team play possible. 
10
-P-A-G-E-144
  
  132 THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
Relay Rule (Boys). 
The ball may be relayed in the game for men and larger boys 
with the following limitations: 
1. Aserve may not be relayed. 
2. A player may not play the ball twice in succession without 
its being touched by another player. 
3. The ball may be hit only three times by the players of one 
side before it goes over the net. 
Violation of any of these rules forfeits the point to the opponents. 
Relay Rule (Girls). 
The ball may be relayed without limitations, both in case of 
served and returned balls, as long as it does not fall to the floor. 
The Score. 
When the serving side wins the point it counts one for that side. 
Only the serving side can score. If the serving side loses the point 
it is called “side out” and the other side takes the ball and serves. 
The first side to score 15 points wins the game. 
The second game begins with the losing side serving. Every 
time a server takes his place to serve he calls the score, giving his 
own score first and then the opponent’s score——as, 12-11, 1-6, 
Illegal Plays. 
A player may not 
1. Strike the ball while he is supported by an object or another 
player. 
2. Bat the ball twice in succession (boys only). 
3. Catch or hold the ball. 
4. Reach over the net to strike the ball. 
5. Serve out of regular order, step on or over back line. 
6. Touch the net while the ball is in play. 
7. Interfere with the opponents by entering their court while 
ay is in progress. 
8. Address the official (except captain). 
9. Make derogatory remarks about players or officials. 
10. Delay the game unnecessarily. 
Any of the above illegal plays either forfeits the point, or the 
ball goes to the opponents, as the case may be. pl
-P-A-G-E-145
  TEAM GAMES—TENNIS TYPE 133 
When a Score Is Made. 
The serving side scores a point whenever 
1. A legally served ball is not returned. 
2. An opponent makes an illegal play. 
Side Is Out. 
The serving side is out whenever 
1. The server fails to make a legal serve. 
2. They fail to return a ball. 
3. Any player of that side makes an illegal play. 
Out of Bounds. 
The ball is out of bounds whenever it strikes the floor, wall, or 
any person or object outside the playing field. When ropes or 
other gymnastic apparatus, suspended from the ceiling, hang within 
the field and the ball in play hits such apparatus, the ball should 
be served again unless the opposing side, by playing the ball, 
tacitly agrees that play should go on. When the ball strikes out- 
side, the point is lost by the side that last touched it. When a 
player in trying to return the ball bats it out of the field on his own 
side of the net, it may be recovered by any player of that side 
before it strikes. When a ball goes in the net it may be recovered 
in like manner if it can be done without the net’s being touched by 
a player. 
Officials. 
The officials for match games are: 
A referee. 
A scorer. 
2 linesmen, one at the left end of each base line. 
(See Lin Diagram.) 
F 3. Minor Net Games Ping Pong. 
This is a diminutive game of lawn tennis played on a table, with 
net, balls and racket smaller to suit the size of the space. 
Badminton. 
This is an English game devised before lawn tennis. It is played 
like lawn tennis, with a similar court, net and racket, but instead
-P-A-G-E-146
  134 THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED: PLAY 
of using a ball, a piece of cork with feathers attached and called 
a “‘shuttlecock” is substituted. This will not bounce, so it is neces- 
sary to volley every stroke. Badminton is played extensively in the 
parks in London, and in some other places in England. 
Il. THE WALL GAMES 
In the wall games there is no net, and the court corresponds to 
one side of the lawn tennis court; the ball is batted against the 
front wall and is played by the opponents when it falls to the floor. 
Both sides must use the same court, but each side has exclusive right 
to it in alternation, the side not in play being obliged to keep out 
of the way. 
1. Hand Ball 
Ireland claims the honor of originating this game. It was first 
played on a court with four walls—front, sides, and rear—and a 
few such courts are still in use. It is more commonly played on a 
court with a front wall only, the other three sides being lines 
painted on the floor. 
Hand ball is played by all nations today, but it has reached the 
height of popularity among the Latin peoples. It comes close to 
being the French national game. In Canada, all French denomina- 
tional schools are equipped with cement or wooden courts to 
play this game. In America, it is popular in the recreational sense. 
For that reason, it is found in Y. M. C. A.’s and business men’s 
clubs as well as in college gymnasiums. 
Dimensions. 
The wall should be 16 feet high and 20 feet wide; if less, two di- 
mensions should be in same proportions,—that is, as 4 to 5. The 
two side lines are at right angles to the wall at its sides. The court 
should be two and a half times as long as the height of the wall. 
The service line is parallel to the wall and divides the court at its 
middle. Just behind the service line, at its two ends, are two spaces 
3 feet square called the ‘‘Partner’s boxes.” 
For ordinary purposes a tennis ball is best, and is played with 
the open hand. 
 
-P-A-G-E-147
TEAM GAMES—TENNIS TYPE 135 
Serving. 
To serve, a player must stand with both feet behind the service 
line, bounce the ball behind the line and then bat it on first bound 
against the front wall so that it will fall behind the serving line. 
One foot may cross the line after the ball is bounced, in the act of 
hitting it. Failure to serve in this manner is a fault, and the server 
may have a second try. 
Returning the Ball. 
The ball properly served must be returned after it has passed 
the service line after hitting the front wall. The opponent may 
take it on the fly or on first bound. 
The opposing players play the ball in turn, using only the open 
hand. 
The Score. 
The server wins a point if the receiver fails to return the ball 
against the front wall so that it will rebound and fall within the 
court. 15 points make a game. ‘The server is the only one who 
scores; when he loses he is out and the opponent serves, as in 
volley ball. 
The server loses his place if he makes a fault, (as explained 
under lawn tennis), fails to return a ball, or bats it out of court. 
Hinders. 
If a spectator gets in the way of a ball or a player, it is a hinder, 
and the play is taken over again. It is also a hinder when a player 
prevents another from. having a fair chance to play the ball, when 
a ball on the way to the wall strikes a player, or when it hits 
suspended apparatus, 
Double Games. 
Here the players serve in the following order; when the first 
server is out he is followed by both the opponents and then by his 
partner, instead of simple alternation. The partner of the server 
must stand in the opposite server’s box until the ball, rebounding 
from the wall, crosses the service line. Either partner may return 
a ball, except in service.

136 © THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
  This is an old game played in castles in Europe in the Middle 
Ages and still played in a few places. Detroit has one racquet club 
which has one court. 
The playing floor is about 40 by 60 feet and is surrounded by 
smooth walls of concrete about 25 feet high. Light is admitted 
through the roof. Doors are made to shut flush, so as to leave 
each wall perfectly smooth. The front wall has a metal base 30 
inches high called the ‘‘telltale” ; the ball in play must strike above 
it or the point is lost. (See FW, in diagram.) 
The ball is of solid rubber and is hit by a light racket with a small 
circular head. The play is very fast and one main difficulty is to 
avoid being hit by the ball. 
The plan of play and scoring is like hand ball and volley ball. 
3. Squash 
Squash is a game closely resembling ‘‘Racquets,” but played in a 
court that is much smaller and built of wood instead of stone. This 
makes it less expensive, so that Squash courts are sometimes built 
in fine residences, and often in modern gymnasium buildings. The 
playing rules of the two games are practically identical.

4. Fives 
In the English schools for boys, where many of our most useful 
and popular games originated, a variation of Hand Ball called Fives 
is played. The court is incomplete as far as walls are concerned, 
there being a front wall and a part of the side walls, but no rear 
wall. The courts are usually built in a row with a common front 
wall and roof and with the rear of the courts open. The ball is 
played with the open hand or with a wooden bat shaped like a 
racket, but smaller. : 
5. Squash Tennis 
This is played on a hand-ball court with a racket instead of the 
hand, but with the same rules as hand ball. 
The racket permits a wider reach and so makes the game less 
violent. 
6. Pelota 
Pelota is a form of wall tennis played in Spanish countries. 
There is a wall at each end of the court, but the side walls are lack- . 
ing. The bat is a peculiar structure of basket work strapped to the 
hand and hollow on one side, so that the ball may be scooped up 
with it. 
7. Pallone 
This is an Italian game in which there is one end wall and one 
side wall. The ball is a heavy and hard one and is batted with 
a spherical block of wood that is held by a handle in the center, 
the player thrusting his hand into a hole in the side of the sphere 
to grasp it. This game is claimed by some to be the descendant 
of an ancient Roman game, and to be the parent of all the other 
tennis games,

  CHAPTER XIil 
TEAM GAMES—FOOTBALL TYPE 
In football games we have a large round or oval ball, which is 
advanced either by kicking, passing or running. Several forms of 
kicking are employed. “Punting” consists in dropping the ball 
from the hands and striking it with the instep and side of the 
foot before it reaches the ground; in the “Drop Kick,” the ball is 
allowed to strike the ground and is kicked with the toe of the shoe 
at the moment it leaves the ground; in the ‘Place Kick,” the ball 
is placed upon the ground, and a player runs forward and kicks it 
(when the oval football is being place kicked, it is kept upright 
on its long axis by means of a small mound of earth or by the 
assistance of a fellow player who holds a finger against the top end 
of it) ; ““Dribbling” consists of the player running forward and con- 
trolling the ball just ahead of himself by short kicks; ‘‘Passing 
the Ball” is either throwing it to one another and catching it 
with the hands, or it may mean kicking it from one to another, 
as in the soccer game. The oval football is thrown from the 
palm of the hand, and whirled so as to give it a spiral motion in 
the air. 
The two main types of football are the Association game and 
Rugby. In Association football;-usually called—“‘Soccer,” a round 
ball i As used, which is mostly handled with the feet ;..dribbling, 
of -advancing-it. F Occasionally it_is struck with the head or the 
body, but the use of the handsand.arms.is-barred. In the 
Rugby games, the ball may be kicked, passed or carried in the arms, 
and a player carrying the ball may be stopped by “Tackling.” In 
the Association game there is a resemblance to hockey in that the 
ball is driven through the goal under the bar and this is the only 
method of scoring; while in Rugby, however, the ball must be 
kicked over the bar in order to count, and there are other ways 
of making scores. These two styles of football arose from the fact 
that the playing field at Rugby was soft, while at Eton and other 
schools it was hard and stony.

  TEAM GAMES—FOOTBALL TYPE 139 
SOCCER FOOTBALL 
This game is played with a round ball slightly smaller than a 
basket ball. 
The Field. 
The field should be level and rectangular in shape. The maximum 
field is 130 by 100 yards in extent, the minimum, 100 by 50. 
The Goals. 
Two posts with a crossbar on top are placed in the middle of 
the goal lines. Regulation posts are 8 yards apart and the cross- 
bar 8 feet above the ground. The goal is said to belong to the 
team defending it. 
Goal Area. 
Lines are marked 6 yards outside of each goal post at right angles 
with the goal line for a distance of 6 yards and these lines are con- 
nected with a line parallel with the goal line. The space within 
the lines is known as the “goal area.” 
Penalty Area. 
Lines are marked 12 yards outside of each goal post at right 
angles with the goal line for a distance of 18 yards and these lines 
are connected with a line parallel with the goal line. The space 
within the lines is known as the “penalty area.’ (See diagram.)

140 THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
Players. 
A regulation team is composed of 11 players, but any number 
may play the game.‘ The names and general work of the positions 
going between the goal posts. He may use any part of his body 
to do so as long as he does not pass outside his goal area. The 
tw. ilbacks act as extra guards to the goal and remain in the 
vicinity of the goal during the progress of the game. The three. 
alfbacks keep some distance behind the forwards, advancing or 
retreating with the ball as the game progresses. The five forwards 
advance the ball and score goals whenever possible. The two out- 
side forwards are called right and left wings. 
The Game. 
The professional game consists of two 45 minute halves with a 
five minute intermission. This time is cut down to 25 or 20 minute 
halves for school boy games. d 
The game begins by a place kick from the center of the field in 
the direction of the opponents’ goal line. The ball must travel 
forward the length of its circumference. The opponents shall not 
approach within the circle until the ball has been kicked off; no 
player may pass beyond the center of the field until the ball has been 
kicked off. The ball is kicked about the field until a goal is scored, 
or the ball goes outside the end line or touch line, or until the 
referee blows his whistle for some other reason. After the scoring 
of a goal the losing team kicks off from the center of the field. 
The winner of the toss has the option of kick off or choice of 
goals. The teams change goals at the end of the first half. After 
the change of goals at half time, the ball is kicked off by the side 
opposite to the one that originally kicked off. 
The Throw In. 
When the ball has crossed the goal line, other than between the 
goal posts, or passed beyond the side lines, either on the ground or 
in the air, it is out of play. If it has crossed the side line it is thrown 
in by a player on the side opposite to the one that put it out. The 
player (wing or halfback) must throw the ball in by standing with 
both feet on the side line and by raising the ball with both hands 
completely over his head. The thrower cannot play the ball again 
until it has been played by another player.
-P-A-G-E-153
TEAM GAMES—FOOTBALL TYPE 141 
Goal Kick. 
When the ball is passed beyond the goal line by a player of the 
opposite side, it is returned to play by the goalkeeper or a fullback, 
kicking it into the field from a point 6 yards in front of the goal post 
nearest which it was when it passed over the line. 
Corner Kick. 
If the ball is played, accidentally or otherwise, behind. the goal 
line by a player defending the goal, then a corner kick is awarded 
to the attacking side. A corner kick is taken from the corner flag 
nearest which the ball was put out. A goal cannot be scored di- 
rectly from a corner kick. On all such kicks no opposing player 
may be within 6 yards of the ball. 
Suspension of Play. 
In case of time out, substitution or injury to a player, the ball 
shall be put in play again by being thrown down by the official at 
the place where it was when time was called, and it is in play when 
it touches the ground. Note: Play is not suspended in case the ball 
hits the goal posts and rebounds back onto the field of play, or if it 
hits any of the officials while they are on the field of play. 
Fouls. 
Fouls are committed as follows: 
1. When the ball is touched intentionally by any part of the 
hands or arms of a player, except the goal-keeper. The referee 
is the judge of this. 
2. When the referee catches a player charging dangerously, 
pushing, holding, tripping, jumping at an opponent, or otherwise 
playing unfairly. The referee is allowed much discretion in his 
interpretation as to what is hard play and what is intentionally 
rough or dangerous. 
3. When a player makes a technical evasion of the rules, such 
as playing the ball a second time before it has been played by an- 
other player, after throwing in or taking a free kick or a penalty 
kick; being offside; carrying the ball, if a goal-keeper (this means 
taking more than two steps while holding the ball); playing the 
ball before it has touched the ground after being thrown down 
by the referee; improper throw in from touch; not kicking ball 
forward from a penalty kick; charging the goal-keeper at the wrong 
time (the goal-tender may be charged when he is holding the ball 
 
-P-A-G-E-154
142 THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
or obstructing an opponent, or when he has passed outside the 
goal area—the charging not being intentionally rough.) 
Penalties—Free Kick. 
A free kick is awarded for any foul committed outside of the 
penalty area. Oppo.,ents must stay 10 yards away from the ball 
until it is kicked. The kicker may not play the ball a second time 
until it has been played by another player. 
Penalty Kick. 
When a foul is committed by a defensive man within the penalty 
area, a penalty kick is awarded the side. The ball is kicked from 
a point 12 yards in front of the goal. The penalty area must be 
cleared of all players except the kicker and the goal-keeper. The 
ball is in play as soon as kicked. 
Scores. 
The side scoring the greatest number of goals is the winner. 
Each goal counts one point. A goal is scored when the whole of 
the ball has passed between the goal posts and under the bar; 
not being thrown in, knocked in (struck or propelled with the 
hands or arms), or carried by any player of the attacking side. A 
goal may be scored from a penalty kick or as the result of a free 
kick awarded for a foul mentioned under number 1 and number 2. 
Note: A goal cannot be scored direct from a kick off, corner kick, 
or goal kick, or from free kicks resulting from breaks of the laws 
included under number 3. 
Change of Players. 
The professional rules do not allow the substitution of a player. 
However, when played by schools and playgrounds, this rule is 
modified to allow a new player to enter the game and to permit 
re-substitution once in case the player has not been removed from 
the game by the referee. A goal-tender can change with another 
player by notifying the referee. 
Offside. 
The official rules place certain restrictions on when a player is 
eligible to play the ball. This is called the offside rule. Because 
it is quite complicated, it is very often omitted in many of the school- 
boy games.
-P-A-G-E-155
  
  TEAM GAMES—FOOTBALL TYPE 143 
A player cannot be offside when he is in his own half of the field, 
when the opponents have last played the ball, while a goal kick 
or-corner kick is being made, or when he is behind the ball. The 
restriction comes when he is ahead of the ball and it has last been 
played by a teammate. In this case the rule states that the player 
ahead of the ball is offside and may not touch the ball himself or 
interfere with an opponent unless there are at the time the ball 
was played at least three of his opponents between him and their 
own goal line. In other words, he must wait until he is again put 
onside before he is eligible to get into the play. 
The Officials. 
A referee and two linesmen are in charge. The referee enforces 
the laws, decides disputed points, keeps a record of the game, acts 
as timekeeper, and may suspend players for rough or ungentle- 
manly conduct. The linesmen decide when the ball is out of play, 
which side is entitled to it on a goal kick, corner kick or throw in, 
and call the referee’s attention to fouls involving rough or un- 
gentlemanly play. 
Field Ball 
Field ball is a new game devised by Dr. Burnett, which is 
gaining favor as a game for high school girls. It combines features 
of soccer, hockey and basket ball. 
The field and goals are the same as in soccer, except that there 
is a semi-circle at each end of the field like the striking circle in 
hockey in place of the goal area and penalty area of soccer. The 
radius of this semi-circle is 15 yards, and it is called the “scoring 
circle.” A defensive player stays within this circle and is prevented 
from stepping outside of it while the ball is in play. 
Teams are of eleven players, arranged in the same formation 
as in soccer and hockey. A soccer or basket ball is used, and is 
passed from player to player. Rules for handling the ball are 
as in basket ball for women. Guarding is also like basket ball for 
women when within the scoring circle, but outside of it a guard 
must stay 15 feet away. The penalties are administered practically 
the same as in soccer. 
The game starts with a free throw, with the team of the thrower 
lined up behind the thrower, as in soccer and hockey. It starts 
the same way after a goal is made, after a resting period and after 
afoul. After a goal the goal-keeper of the defending side has a free
-P-A-G-E-156
  144 THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
throw from any place within the scoring circle. A player having a 
free throw may go back and take a running start. The same free 
throw is allowed whenever the attackers send the ball over the 
end line. 
A ball thrown through the goal from a position outside the 
scoring circle counts two points; when thrown from a point within 
the circle it counts one point. A ball so thrown that it passes over 
the crossbar scores one point for the defending side. 
When the defenders send the ball over the end line, the attacking 
side has a free throw from the nearest corner of the field, the 
defenders being lined up outside the end line of the field. 
Field ball is played in ten-minute quarters, with five-minute rest 
periods. 
Speedball 
Speedball is a new game evolved out of soccer but adding the 
use of the hands under certain conditions, and bringing about more 
scoring possibilities. It was invented and first used successfully by 
the Intramural Department of the University of Michigan. 
The one great distinction between soccer and speedball is that, 
in the latter, the rules permit the catching of “fly balls.” If the 
ball is kicked into the air and is caught before touching the ground 
it is called a “‘fly ball’ and may be passed or kicked. A “ground 
ball” (one that is bouncing) must be played as in soccer without 
the use of the hands. A player who kicks the ball into the air is 
eligible to catch it himself before it hits the ground. 
The player having possession of the ball cannot run with it. He 
must advance it by means of a kicking dribble or by an overhead 
dribble, the latter being permitted but once. That is, a player may 
toss the ball forward and recover it before it hits the ground. He 
may then pass or kick it or drop it to the ground and dribble it 
down the field with the feet. 
Speedball is played on a field similar to a soccer field except 
that there are two end zones added, as in football, ten yards behind 
the goal lines. There is also a penalty area in front of each goal, 
reaching 18 yards into the playing field and being 28 yards in width. 
The penalty mark is the same as in soccer. The goal posts are 20 
feet in height. 
There are three means of scoring from the field, counting three, 
two, and one, respectively. The first is when the ball is kicked under 
the crossbar, the second is when a forward pass is received in the
-P-A-G-E-157
  ~ TEAM GAMES—FOOTBALL TYPE 145 
end zone behind the goal line, and the third is when the ball is drop- 
kicked over the crossbar and between the uprights. 
There is also a personal foul rule, similar to basket ball, and a 
penalty kick from the foul line, made after such an infraction of the 
rules, counts two. Technical fouls, such as running with the ball 
or illegally touching it with the hands, are penalized by giving the 
ball to the opposite side at the point when the offense occurs and 
allowing a free kick or drop kick, the side making the break being 
10 yards away. However, a technical foul committed by the 
defense within the penalty area is more severely penalized, a penalty 
kick being awarded. 
When a ball is fought over and held by two players, as in basket 
ball, it is laid on the ground and the opposing players stand, each 
with his left foot against the ball, until the signal from the referee 
allows them to attempt to kick it away. 
The advantages of speedball are that it combines passing, kick- 
ing, and dribbling. Scoring is an easy matter. It is easy to learn. 
The goal-tender has a variety of duties as he is permitted to inter- 
change with other teammates. The game is less rough than soccer 
because the penalties for personal fouls are made more severe. 
The periods of the game, the plan of substitution, and the time 
out rule, are the same as in basket ball. 
A referee and two assisting linesmen are in charge of the game. 
RUGBY FOOTBALL GAMES 
The Rugby games are much more complicated than Association 
Football. Scores are made in several ways, and a greater variety 
of plays is permitted—kicking, running with the ball, and passing, 
all being used. This necessarily makes the rules more complex 
and difficult to understand. American Rugby and English Rugby 
differ considerably. In American Rugby there is much mass play, 
while the English game is more open. The use of mass play in the 
American game comes about principally through the habit of using 
what is called “Interference,” which consists in sending a group 
of men ahead of the man with the ball to protect him from the 
opposing tacklers. The players ahead of the ball are ‘‘offside,” 
and passing to an “offside” man is not allowed in English Rugby; 
therefore passing the ball forward is not permitted in the Eng- 
lish game, while in American Rugby it is only allowed once in each 
play, and was not allowed at all until the season of 1906. 
 
-P-A-G-E-158
    146 THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
American Rugby 
This is the game usually called “College Football.” It is played 
on a field 300.feet long and_169 feet wide, with an “end zone” 30 
feet long at each end as wide as the field. This makes the whole 
space 360 feet long. The two end zones are used especially for the 
forward pass, which may be legally caught in these sections, as well 
as on the playing field. The playing field should be level and well 
covered with grass, mowed short. At each end are the goals, on 
the middle of the goal line. Each goal has two posts 18% feet 
apart with a crossbar ro feet up. The side lines and endlines are 
marked with lime and similar lines are marked across the field 
every 5 yards to help the officials to measure the distances. 
The Play. 
It is the object of each team, which consists of 11 men, to 
defend its own goal and to score points by kicking or carrying the 
ball into the opponents’ territory>{A player carrying the ball may 
be stopped by grasping him and throwing him to the ground. This 
is called “Tackling.” No one may be tackled except the man with 
the ball. When a tackle is made the referee blows his whistle de- 
claring the ball dead and the two teams line up for a scrimmage as 
later described. To prevent opponents from tackling the player 
with the ball, his fellows often form a group and run in front of 
him, or between him and the opponents. Men thus acting as pro- 
tection for the man carrying the ball are said to form an “‘nter- 
ference.” Men on the side having the ball may not use their hands 
to keep opponents away, but may run against them with hip, shoul- 
der, or arms held against the body. The side not in possession of 
the ball may use hands or arms freely to aid them in getting to the 
man with the ball. 
The Game. 
The game consists of_four_periods of fifteen minutes each, or a 
shorter time agreed upon. Fifteen minutes rest is given between 
halves and 1 minute between quarters. Time is taken out for 
injuries, calling of fouls, ball out of bounds, and a few other more 
technical occurrences. 
Before beginning the game, the captains toss a coin and the 
winner may either choose the goal he will defend or take the ball. 
If he chooses the goal, this means that the other side may elect to 
kick off or receive. The loser has the choice at the start of the 
second half.
-P-A-G-E-159
    
TEAM GAMES—FOOTBALL TYPE 147 
During\the minute intermission preceding the second and fourth 
quarters of the game, the players change goals but do not leave the 
field of play. The ball is placed in the same relative position only 
facing the Opposite direction from which it was when the preceding 
period ended. Otherwise the play proceeds as though no change 
was made, the number of downs and distance to gain being the same. 
Scoring. 
Scores are made as follows: a touchdown counts six; a score 
following a touchdown counts one; a goal from the field counts 
three; a safety counts two for the opponents. The way in which 
each of these scores is won will be described in the proper place 
in the following description of the play. 
Officials. 
The officials of the game are a referee, an umpire, | a linesman. 
and a field judge. The referee has general charge of the ball and 
is judge of its position and progress. His whistle stops play. He 
also decides points under certain other cases specified in the rules. 
He stands behind the team having possession of the ball. The 
umpire is the judge of the conduct of the players, and has for his 
duty the calling of certain classes of fouls apt to occur near his 
position in the field. He stands behind the defensive team. The 
linesman, under the direction of the referee marks the distance 
gained, and has jurisdiction over the positions of the players when 
the ball is put in play. He also assists in watching for fouls 
involving personal conduct. He takes a position to the side of the 
play and stands his stick even with the forward point of the ball. 
It is the duty of the field judge to occupy a position well back 
of the team not in possession of the ball and toward the side of the 
field opposite from the linesman, and to relieve the referee of some 
of his duties in this part of the field; also to keep the time and 
report fouls not coming to the attention of the umpire. The 
linesman has two assistants. Each carries a stake, the two stakes 
being connected by a rope or chain 10 yards long. One assistant 
sets his stake on the side line of the field directly opposite the 
place where the ball first starts out in one team’s possession, and 
the other sets his the full length of the connecting line in the direc- 
tion the team with the ball will try to advance it. This team must 
gain the 10 yards to the second stake in four trials or forfeit the 
ball.

Diagram of the Field of Play 
The Field of Play is a Parallelogram bounded by the side lines 
and goal lines and thus measuring 300 feet by 160 feet. 
Kick-Off. 
The game begins by a play known as “Kick-Off.” Upon the 
referee’s signal the team having the ball kicks it from its own 40 
yard line, at a point equidistant from the side lines. The kicker’s 
side must all be behind the ball when it is kicked and the opponents 
must be behind a line 10 yards in front of it. When the ball is 
kicked, the kicker’s team charges down the field as fast as possible 
to the vicinity where it strikes. It is usually caught by one of the 
opposing side, who runs it back as far as he can before being tackled. 
The referee now blows his whistle as signal for play to stop, while 
he instructs the linesman and his assistants where to set their stakes. 
A Scrimmage. 
Following the kick-off the two teams line up in a formation known 
as a scrimmage, shown by the diagram.

Q, quarterback; H, H, halfbacks; F, fullback. 
Notice that there are seven forwards, one quarterback, two 
halfbacks and one fullback. The ball is held by the center player. 
The captain or the quarterback calls a signal which all the men 
of that team understand as the call for a certain play, having agreed 
upon it and rehearsed it in practice beforehand; the whole team ~ 
unites in an effort to carry it out successfully. Such plays usually 
begin by the center’s passing the ball to the quarterback, and in 
most plays he passes it to a third player, who runs with it, so as to 
advance with it toward the opponent’s goal. Each team has learned 
a variety of plays and the quarterback uses them according to his 
judgment. 
A scrimmage ends when the player carrying the ball is tackled 
or carries the ball over the goal line. A down is then declared. 
It is also a down if a forward pass hits the ground before being 
caught. Four downs are allowed to make the necessary 10 yards. 
In case this distance is made before the four downs are used up, 
a new first down is declared, 
A Touchdown. 
The game may continue by a succession of scrimmages until 
one team succeeds in touching the ball down on or behind the 
 
-P-A-G-E-162
  150 THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
opponent’s goal line. This constitutes a touchdown. It counts 6, 
and also gives the successful team the privilege of a try-at-goal. 
To do this the ball is brought out into the field 5 yards distant from 
the goal and the two teams line up against each other. The team 
that has just scored is allowed one down to score again by any 
means it may choose. If successful an additional point is added to 
their score. Following a touchdown and the attendant try-at-goal, 
play is resumed by a kick-off. The side scored upon has the right 
to decide who shall kick. Rugby is the only game in which scores 
are made by merely carrying the ball over the goal line; in all other 
games of this type it must go through the goal. Kicking the ball 
over the line, however, does not score. 
Punting. 
When a team finds itself unable to make the required 10 yards 
in four trials, punting is usually resorted to. Since even an in- 
different punter can advance the ball several yards, it is better to 
punt on the fourth trial than to lose it on downs with no advance. 
The punter is placed well back, so as to enable him to get the ball 
away before an opponent can reach him; the center sends him the 
ball by a long pass, and it is punted down the field into the oppo- 
nents’ territory. The two ends run down the field after the ball so 
as to be ready to tackle the man who catches it before he can gain 
much distance in running; the other teammates must hesitate be- 
fore running after the ball, as they first form interference to give 
the kicker time. If the man catching it is a good punter he may 
punt it back again, but this is seldom done. 
On the punt play it must be remembered that players of the 
kicking side, who are ahead of the ball when it is kicked, are 
“offside” and may not play the ball themselves until it has first 
been touched by an opponent. 
The Forward Pass. 
The forward pass consists in passing the ball toward the oppo- 
nents’ goal. It not only is a means of gaining ground, but is a threat 
which serves to keep the defense spread out so as to enhance the 
chances of a successful running attack. The ball is held on the palm 
of the hand and thrown end first with a whirling motion, so that it is 
offered the least resistance in its flight. It is possible to throw the 
ball a distance of 40 or 50 yards in this way. The ball may be 
passed forward by any player, provided that in passing it the 
thrower stands five yards behind the line of scrimmage. Such a
-P-A-G-E-163
  
TEAM GAMES—FOOTBALL TYPE IS 
forward pass may be caught by any player of the same side who was 
a yard behind the line of scrimmage, or was an end man on the line 
of scrimmage. Any opponent is eligible to catch a forward pass— 
this is called “intercepting a pass.’ After a pass has been touched 
by a member of the defense, and while it is still in the air, it becomes 
a free ball for either side. If the ball falls to the ground it counts 
as a down and the play starts once more from the spot of the 
preceding scrimmage. Such a failure is termed an “incompleted 
pass.” 
A Goal from the Field. 
When a team finds itself in front of the opponents’ goal and 
within kicking distance, a goal from the field is often attempted. A 
punt is not permitted, the rules requiring a drop-kick or place-kick. 
The ball in the latter case is passed far back by the center to the 
quarter-back, who holds it for the kicker. If the ball goes between 
the posts and over the crossbar, a goal is scored, and the play is 
resumed as in case of a touchdown. 
Safety and Touchback. 
A “safety” is scored when a player with the ball is downed be- 
hind his own goal line. A safety usually occurs unintentionally, as 
when a bad pass by the center, or a fumble by the receiver, causes 
the ball to roll behind a team’s own goal. If, however, the ball is 
declared dead behind the goal line in the possession of a defending 
player, the force which sent it there coming from the attackers, no 
score is made, and the play is called a ‘“‘touchback.” The most fre- 
quent touchbacks result from a punt or incompleted pass by the 
attacking side. 
Following a safety, play is resumed by placing the ball on the 
defenders 30 yard line; after a touchback on the 20 yard line. From 
these respective points the defending side may choose whether to 
punt or scrimmage. 
A Fumble. 
When the ball is dropped in passing it or running with it, the 
accident is called a “fumble,” and any player who can get possession 
of it may doso. It is not allowable, however, to take the ball away 
from an opponent. Fumbles are often costly errors, as the man 
who picks up the ball frequently gets too far away to be tackled, 
and makes a touchdown unassisted.

Penalties. 
Refusal to play when the Referee orders it may be penalized by 
forfeiture of the game. Unnecessary roughness and striking with 
the closed fist call for disqualification of the player, and in addition 
a loss of half the distance to the goal line. Most cases of foul are 
penalized by loss of distance 5, 10, or 15 yards, according to the 
nature of the offense. Distance penalties are provided for holding, 
tripping, illegal use of the hands and arms in interference, and 
rough play; also for offside play in scrimmage, coaching from the 
sidelines, and other fouls of a technical nature. 
Some fouls include loss of ball to the offended side without a 
distance penalty; a case is where a foul occurs when neither side 
is in possession of the ball; when an offside player on a punt touches 
the ball, five yards are given in addition. 
The most common fouls of all are being offside in scrimmage, 
which means a $-yard penalty, and holding or illegal interference 
by the offensive team, which is penalized to the extent of 15 yards. 
An important thing to note is that when the defensive side is 
penalized, a first down is given the team with the ball in addition 
to the distance gain; however, when the offensive side is the violator, 
the distance penalty is made, setting the ball back, but the number 
of the down and the place to be reached remain the same as before. 
Time Out. 
Time out is allowed for injuries to a player or upon request of 
a captain. Two minutes are allowed. Each team is allowed three 
time outs during a half, but for each succeeding request a minor 
penalty is inflicted. A time out is not charged against a team if a 
substitute is sent in for the injured player.   Substitutes. 
A player may be substituted for another, but must go onto the 
field when the ball is dead, and must first report to the referee or 
umpire before engaging in play. He is not allowed to communicate 
with his fellow players until after one down has occurred. 
A player taken from the game during the first half may return 
during the second half. This right however is not extended to a 
player who has been disqualified or suspended from the game. 
Moreover, a player removed in the second half, may not return 
at all.

TEAM GAMES—FOOTBALL TYPE 153 
) High Low Ball 
This is a game invented by James Naismith, and intended to 
serve as an introduction to football. The team play is not compli- 
cated, individual skill being stressed more. 
The football field is used, but the center circle is added as in 
soccer. A soccer ball is used. Eleven men compose a team. Twenty 
minute halves are played with a ten minute intermission. The 
object of the game is to kick the ball over the crossbar from the field 
of play, or from behind the restraining line, which is 20 yards out 
from the goal line. While play is on, a score may be made from the 
field of play by a drop kick or punt and counts three points. In 
case the ball is carried over the goal line by a player, it is then 
brought out to the restraining line, and it must then be drop kicked. 
A score in this case counts one point, as does a drop kick from the 
point where a foul has been committed. 
The ball must be played with the feet or legs when it is below 
the height of the hips. When above the height of the hips, the 
ball must be played by the hands, head, body or arms. If the ball 
is caught the player may pass or kick the ball, or run with it. A 
forward pass is not allowed however. 
When a player runs with the ball he may be tackled, but only 
above the hips. Teammates are not allowed to use the hands or arms 
to make interference for the runner. 
When the player running with the ball is tackled, the referee 
calls a down at the point where the forward progress was stopped. 
The game starts by a kick-off. The winner of the toss has the 
choice of goal, and the loser kicks off. The ball is kicked from the 
center line and all other players must stand outside the center circle. 
The teams change goals at the beginning of the second half. 
After a down, the ball is put in play by being placed on the ground 
between the man carrying it and the nearest opponent, each facing 
his own goal, and placing the inside of his right foot against the 
ball. At the referee’s signal play starts again. All other players 
must be ten feet away. 
After the ball is carried over the goal line, a kick from the re- 
straining line results. Following this kick, whether the goal is 
made or missed, the ball is put in play by a kick from within the 
20 yard line, the opponents being required to be 10 yards distant. 
The same thing happens whenever the ball crosses the end lines 
other than by a goal from the field; after a goal from the field it 
     
-P-A-G-E-166
  154 THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
goes back to the center of the field for a kick-off by the side against 
whom it was scored. 
On a ball out of bounds on the side lines a player of the side 
opposite to the one touching it last puts it in play by a kick. 
Penalties for the fouls, such as holding, pushing, rough play, 
illegal play on balls below and above the waist, and forward pass- 
ing permit a free kick or legal pass by the opponents from the spot 
where the foul was made. Opponents must be 10 yards away. 
A referee is in charge of the game. He is assisted by two umpires 
who may call fouls and out of bound balls. 
Tag Football 
This is a form of football played in some Universities as a part 
of the afternoon class exercise. The rules of football are followed 
with the exception that a runner is downed when he is tagged by an 
opponent. Interference for the runner must be made from a stand- 
ing position, and is limited to the use of the shoulders and of the 
arms, with the hands being kept against the chest. 
Team Kicking Duel 
Two teams of equal sides compete. A score is made when a 
drop kick over the opponents’ goal is made. In order to get near 
the goal for a successful drop kick, the players attempt to gain 
ground by means of a kicking duel, by alternate turns at punting 
or drop kicking. Whenever a kicked ball is caught on the fly, the 
receiver may return the kick from that spot; but in case a ball hits 
the ground, the team receiving it must kick from a spot 10 yards 
back from where it first landed. This gives good practice in plac- 
ing kicks, also in catching them from difficult angles.

CHAPTER XIV 
TEAM GAMES—HOCKEY TYPE 
Historical Sketch. 
Hockey has been played in Great Britain in its present form for 
50 years; as a crude game with an indefinite number of players 
it has been common in northern Europe for many centuries. In the 
earliest times it was not distinguished from football; it was played 
for a long time in Ireland with a small ball but with no club, and 
was called “Hurling.” Ice hockey in the crude form is still older, 
having been played by the Scandinavians from prehistoric times, 
but it is one of the latest games to have definite rules, the first 
set being adopted by the Canadian Hockey Association only a few 
years ago. Lacrosse is a running game played by the Indians and 
believed by some to have been taught them by French missionaries. 
About 1850 it was revised by the Canadians and shortly afterwards 
introduced into the United States. A number of our Eastern col- 
leges have taken up the game. Polo is of Asiatic origin, and was 
probably played by the Persians at the time of Alexander the Great. 
It was introduced from Tibet into China in the 6th century A.D., 
and was common in India for several centuries, but had entirely 
disappeared when that country was first occupied by the English. 
It was first brought into Europe by the Crusaders in the 5th century. 
Recent interest in the game is due chiefly to the English. 
Hockey and football games differ in the size of the ball and the 
way of handling it. In hockey games there is a small ball driven 
by a bent stick; in football there is a large ball handled with the 
hands and feet only. 
The principal hockey games are field hockey, ice hockey, lacrosse, 
and polo. Field hockey is played by both men and women in Eng- 
land, but in the United States it is played by women only, and is 
rapidly becoming their major fall sport. A simpler form known as 
Shinny is played by small boys, using home-made sticks and a tin 
can or block of wood.

  156 THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
1. Field Hockey 
The Hockey Field. 
The field should be a level, smooth stretch of turf, kept short 
and well rolled. The better the condition of the ground, the greater 
can be the accuracy and skill of play. 
The dimensions of the regulation hockey field are 100 yards in 
length by not less than 50 and not more than 60 yards in width, 
the space being marked out with lime lines and with a flag stationed 
at each corner. In games between girls the field may be considerably 
smaller. The field is divided as shown in the following diagram:

Equipment. 
The game is played with hockey sticks and ball. Sticks should 
weigh from 21 to 25 ounces; players on the forward line use 
lighter sticks, while those playing in the backfield use the heavier 
weight. 
Heavy boots or shoes with low heels are best for the sake of 
protection to the ankles and feet. 
 
-P-A-G-E-169
| TEAM GAMES—HOCKEY TYPE 157 
The Game. 
The game is played by 22 players, 11 on each team. Each eleven 
consists of 5 forwards, 3 halfbacks, 2 fullbacks, and 1 goalkeeper. 
The 5 forwards are center forward, right inside forward, left 
inside forward, right wing, and left wing. The halfbacks are center 
halfback, right halfback, and left halfback. The fullbacks are 
right fullback and left fullback. 
At the start of the game, after each goal, and after each half, 
each team lines up in its own half of the field facing its opponent’s 
goal, according to the following diagram. 
  The object of the game is to carry the ball by means of the 
stick, using passes and hits, from one member of the team to 
another, through the opponent’s goal. A goal is scored when 
the ball has passed entirely over the goal line between the posts as 
a result of a hit by an attacker or having glanced off an attacker’s 
stick. Each goal scores one point. 
“Bully Off.” 
The game is started by one player of each team, usually the cen- 
ter forwards, together bullying the ball in the center of the field.
-P-A-G-E-170
158 THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
To bully the ball, each player shall strike first the ground on her 
own side of the ball and then her opponent’s stick alternately three 
times, after which one of these two players must strike the ball 
before it is in general play. The two players who are bullying 
stand squarely facing the side lines while every other player must 
be nearer her own goal line than the ball. 
For any breach of this rule, the bully shall be taken again. 
General Details. 
The ball may be caught (but must be released at once to fall to 
the ground) or stopped, but may not be picked up, carried, kicked, 
thrown, knocked forward or backward, except with the stick. No 
player shall gain an advantage by the use of any part of her 
apparel or person except as may result from stopping the ball. No 
player shall in any way interfere with the game unless her stick is 
in her hand. 
When the Ball Passes Over the Side Lines. 
It shall be rolled in along the ground (not bounced) into play 
from the point where it crossed the side line in any direction by 
one of the players of the team opposite to that of the play who 
last touched it. No player shall stand within the 5 yard line, but 
may cross it as soon as the ball leaves the hand of the roller-in, 
who must have both feet and stick behind the side line, and may not 
play the ball again until another player has played it. 
Breach of the rule by the roller-in; the roll-in shall be taken by a 
player of the other team. 
Breach of the rule by any other player; the roll-in shall be taken 
again. 
When the Ball Is Sent Over the Goal Line (Not Between the 
Goal Posts). 
a. Bya player of the attacking team or a player of the defend- 
ing team who is further from her own goal than 25 yards, it shall 
be brought out 25 yards in a direction at right angles to the goal 
line from the point where it crossed the line and there “‘bullied.” 
b. If the ball glances off the stick, or is unintentionally sent be- 
hind the goal line by any player of the defending team, behind the 
25 yard line, it shall be given as a corner hit to the opposing team. 
Corner Hit. 
A player of the attacking team shall have a hit from a point 
on the side or goal line within 3 yards of the nearest corner, and 
 
-P-A-G-E-171
TEAM GAMES—HOCKEY TYPE 159 
at the moment of such hit all the defending teams (their sticks and 
feet) must be behind their own goal line, and all the attacking 
team must be outside the circle in the field of play. 
No player shall stand within 5 yards of the striker, and no goal 
can be scored from a corner hit, unless the ball has been stopped 
(not necessarily motionless) on the ground by one of the attacking 
team, or has touched the person or stick of one of the defending 
team, before the last stroke of the attacking team. The player tak- 
ing the corner, may not participate in the game again until the ball 
has been played by another player. In case she does, a free hit shall 
be given the defending team. In case of sticks by the striker of the 
corner, the defending team shall have a free hit; also for shooting 
at goal before the ball has been stopped, not necessarily motionless. 
The Score. 
The game is won by the side scoring the most goals in two halves 
of 20 minutes each, or any shorter time agreed upon. Goals are 
chosen by lot before the game and changed at the beginning of the 
second half. The rules provide for two umpires, one for each half 
of the field, and a referee. The referee has direct charge of the 
ball, and is the superior official of the game; the umpires observe 
the action of the players and call certain fouls assigned to them. 
Fouls. 
1. Violation of above details. 
2. Playing with the back side or rounded side of the stick. 
3. Raising the stick above the shoulders either at the beginning 
or end of the stroke, when striking at the ball. This foul is called 
“sticks.” 
Personal Fouls. 
4. Charging, kicking, shoving, shinning, tripping, personal 
handling or hooking of sticks, striking at or lifting of sticks. 
5. A player must not obstruct by running in between her oppo- 
nent and the ball, nor across her opponent’s left unless she touches 
the ball before her opponent’s person or stick does. 
6. Undercutting the ball. 
Off Side. 
7. When a player hits or rolls in the ball, any other player 
of the same team who is nearer her opponent’s goal line than the 
striker or roller-in at the time the ball was hit or rolled-in, is off 
side, unless there be at least three of her opponents nearer to their 
 
-P-A-G-E-172
  160 THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
own goal than she is. She may not play the ball nor in any way 
interfere with any other player until the ball has been touched or hit 
by one of her opponents. No player shall be penalized for merely 
standing in an off-side position; there is no breach of the rule unless 
a player when in such a position gains an advantage or plays the 
ball or interferes with another player. 
Penalties for Fouls. 
1. Outside the Striking Circles. 
For any breach of above rules, the penalty shall be a free hit 
for one of the opposing team on the spot where the breach occurred. 
Free Hit. 
On the occasion of a free hit, no other player than the striker shall 
be within 5 yards of the spot where such hit is made, and after 
taking the hit, the striker shall not again touch the ball or play it 
until the ball has been touched or hit by another player. She must 
fairly hit the ball, scooping up not being allowed. If the striker 
hits at but misses the ball, the stroke shall again be taken by her, 
provided that she has not given “sticks.” 
In case of violation of any of the requirements of the free hit, 
the penalty shall be the same as for other fouls. 
2. Inside the Striking Circles. 
a. By the attacking team. The penalty shall be a free hit for 
the defending team. 
b. By the defending team. The penalty shall be a “penalty 
corner” for the attacking team. In case of a wilful breach of rule 
or when a goal would probably have been scored but for the foul, 
a “penalty bully” shall be given. 
Penalty Corner. 
A player of the attacking team shall have a hit from any point 
on the goal line she may choose, provided it is at a distance of not 
less than 10 yards from the nearest goal post. All players of the 
defending team, their sticks and feet, must be behind their own goal 
line; all the attacking team must be outside the striking circle in the 
field of play. No player shall stand within 5 yards of the striker. 
No goal can be scored by the attacking team unless the ball has 
been stopped by one of the attacking team or has touched the person 
or stick of the defending team before the last stroke of the attack-
-P-A-G-E-173
TEAM GAMES—HOCKEY TYPE 161 
ing team. A player hitting a penalty corner hit, cannot again par- 
ticipate in the game until the ball has been played by another player. 
A free hit shall be given the defending team in case of violation 
of any of the requirements by the attacking team. 
Penalty Bully. 
Shall be played by the offender and by any other player selected 
by the other team, on the spot where the breach of the rule occurred. 
All other players shall be beyond the nearer 25 yard line in the field 
of play, and shall not cross this 25 yard line or take any further 
part in the game until the penalty bully is completed. If during the 
progress of the bully the ball goes over the goal line not between 
the goal posts, off the stick of offender, the penalty bully shall be 
taken again. If the ball goes over the goal line between the goal 
posts off the stick or person of the offender, a penalty goal shall be 
awarded the attackers. In all other cases as soon as the ball has 
passed wholly over the goal line (not between the goal posts) or 
outside the striking circle, the game shall be re-started with a bully 
on the center of the nearer 25 yard line. Breach of any rule of the 
penalty bully by the offender gives the attacking team a penalty 
goal. Breach of rule by the attacker selected for the bully gives 
the defending team a free hit. 
2. Ice Hockey 
Ice Hockey is a game played on ice on skates and is a very popular 
winter sport in the northern states and Canada. In many respects 
the game follows closely the plan of Field Hockey. The field is 
similarly planned, but is smaller, and is called a rink. This rink 
should measure not less than 112 feet long by 58 feet wide, but to 
produce better results should be about 160 feet long by 80 feet wide. 
It should be surrounded by a board fence, called the banking board, 
which is about three and one-half to four feet high, although the 
game may be played on an open space. The purpose of the bank 
is to allow a rebound of the ‘‘puck,’”’ which is a small disk of 
vulcanized rubber. This rebound from the side is an important 
element in the game. The game is played with six or seven players, 
but in the past few years the seven-man team has been almost en- 
tirely abandoned. The object of the game is to shoot the “puck” 
into the opponent’s goal. A goal is placed at each end of the rink 
about six feet out from the end, and is either a stationary or moy-  
-P-A-G-E-174
162 THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
able cage made of wire or net and stands about four feet high and 
six feet wide. Each goal scored counts one point for the team mak- 
ing the score, and the team scoring the largest number of points 
during the allotted time wins the game. 
The main official is the referee, although in some cases an assistant 
referee may be employed. There are also two goal umpires who 
stand behind the goals and decide whether the puck has gone into 
the goals, a penalty time keeper who keeps time for players tem- 
porarily suspended from the game by the referee, and a time 
keeper who keeps the actual playing time of the game. The time 
of the game varies, but three fifteen-minute periods with intermis- 
sion of ten minutes between periods has proved to be most satisfac- 
tory for regulation matches. ~~

  The game is started by a method called “‘facing off.” The players 
of the two teams line up as shown in the diagram, and the puck 
is thrown on the ice between the sticks of the two opposing center 
players, who upon the referee’s whistle try to get possession of it. 
The puck is generally advanced by the player pushing it along 
the ice with his hockey stick; this is called ‘“‘carrying the puck.” If 
the puck is passed from one player to another of the same team, 
the player passing the puck must pass it to a player who is even 
with him or behind him. To pass the puck to a player who is ahead 
of him constitutes an “‘off side,” for which offense the referee stops
-P-A-G-E-175
  TEAM GAMES—HOCKEY TYPE 163 
play and faces off at the place the off side occurred. Dodging, en- 
circling or caroming the puck off the board are all legal methods of 
passing an opposing player. In order to keep on side, players must 
always attempt to keep between the puck and their own goal except 
when inside of twenty feet in front of their own goal, in which 
region off side plays do-not exist. 
The personnel of the team is made up of three forwards (a center 
and two wing players), two defense men, and a goal tender. The 
goal tender is padded with a stomach protector and guards which 
reach from the ankles to hips, and his duty is to stop all opponent’s 
shots from entering his goal. All players on the team are eligible 
to score goals, but the greater amount of the scoring is done by 
the forwards, although the defense men often rush the puck down 
the ice and score. In shooting for goal, the best way to hit the puck 
is a quick stroke accompanied by a turning of the blade of the stick 
so as to raise the puck off the ice and send it with a whirling motion 
which is difficult to stop. 
Tackling, roughness, tripping, or holding are not allowed and a 
penalty for such rough play may lead to suspension from the game 
for a short period of time, depending on the seriousness of the 
offense. Throwing the puck or stick is also a penal offense, while 
kicking the puck with the skate is ruled the same way as an off side. 
Substitutions can be made at will in this game. The players wear 
shin guards to prevent injuries from the puck and wear heavy gloves 
to protect their hands from blows from an opponent’s stick when 
they are checked by an opponent. 
3. Lacrosse 
Lacrosse differs from hockey in the form of the club and in the 
way that it is used; in lacrosse this is something like an elongated 
and loosely strung tennis racket which is used with both hands. 
The manner of play is to catch the ball in the crosse and then to 
run with it or to throw it. Much skill is necessary to pick up the 
ball, catch it, and throw it with this implement, while the running 
makes it as vigorous work as any game. 
The Field. 
The field in lacrosse is about the same size and shape as in hockey, 
and the goals are similarly placed. The goal posts are six feet 
apart and the cross bar six feet up, and the goals are usually fitted 
12
-P-A-G-E-176
164 THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
with nets as in hockey. The goal stands in the center of a square 
which is twelve feet on a side and which is enclosed by a mark called 
the “goal crease.” 
The Teams. 
The teams in lacrosse consist of twelve players. 
  Diagram of Lacrosse Field 
GC, Goal Crease 
Score. 
The game is won by the side scoring the greatest number of goals 
in the time agreed upon, which is divided into two halves. The 
officials are two umpires and a referee. 
The Play. 
Play begins in the center of the field by a play that corresponds 
to the “Bully” in hockey and to the “Toss up” in basket ball, and 
which is called “Facing.” The ball is placed on the ground and the 
two opponents stand on opposite sides of it as in hockey, each hay- 
ing his left side toward the goal he is attacking, with their crosses 
touching the ground and parallel to the goal line, so that the ball 
lies between them. To begin play each player draws his crosse 
toward him on the ground until it is past the ball; then each is 
free to lift his crosse from the ground and try for the possession 
of the ball by picking it up or driving it to a player of his own side. 
The ball is thrown from one to another by means of the crosse, and 
finally thrown through the goal. Running with the ball is permitted, 
but is not usually good play, since the ball can be passed much 
more rapidly than one canrun. The ball is made of spongy India 
rubber, and is about the size of a tennis ball, but heavier.
-P-A-G-E-177
  
  TEAM GAMES—HOCKEY TYPE 165 
Defensive Play. 
A player on defense may stand in the way of a man running, 
strike an opponent’s crosse with his own, or catch the ball in his 
crosse when it leaves that of an opponent. Each player should 
cover his opponent closely when any opponent has the ball, so as 
to prevent a good pass; he should get away from him as fast as 
possible when his own side gets the ball; in this respect and in the 
absence of off-side play the game is much like basket ball. 
Fouls. 
It is a foul (1) to strike, hold, trip or push an opponent; (2) 
to throw the crosse; (3) to interfere with a player pursuing an 
opponent; (4) to interfere with the goal-keeper within the goal 
crease before the ball has passed into it; (5) to touch the ball with 
the hand (except the goal-keeper). The penalty for a foul is 
called a “Free position,” in which the ball is put in play by a player 
of the offended side with no opponent nearer than five yards. 
4. Polo 
Polo is played on horseback, by driving a wooden ball with a 
long-handled mallet. Teams consist of an even number of players, 
anywhere from two to eight. The shape of the field and the 
general manner of playing are like hockey, but the field is from 
five to seven times as large. Polo is played most extensively at 
army posts, by cowboys on the plains, and in other localities where 
horsemanship is a prominent feature of every-day life. Small ponies 
are often used in the games instead of horses. 
5. Roller Polo 
This resembles ice hockey, being played on roller skates, but a 
mallet is used instead of a bent stick.

CHAPTER XV 
TEAM GAMES—BASKET BALL TYPE 
As in the case of the Baseball, we have here several games re- 
lated to and often played as a preparation for the major game of 
the group. This makes it advisable to study the major game first. 
1. Basket Ball 
Basket ball is America’s most popular indoor game. It was 
invented in 1890 by Dr. James Naismith, then a student at Spring- 
field Y.M.C.A. college and since that time a director of physical 
education, with the object of securing an indoor game that would 
have the advantage of the various types of football, with the dan- 
gers of football eliminated as far as possible. The plan hit upon 
was to prohibit a player from carrying the ball, which in turn 
eliminated the necessity for tackling or interference. Instead the 
ball is advanced by passing, or by dribbling, the latter name being 
given when a player bounces the ball against the floor, but retains 
possession of it. This gives the game some of the qualities of 
Association Football and English Rugby, but perhaps it resembles 
Lacrosse most of all. 
The goals used in all football and hockey games, consisting of 
two upright posts and a cross-bar, represent in a dramatic sense 
the gates of fortresses or walled cities. In the early days when these 
games were first played, the teams represented castles or walled 
towns, and the playing space was often the entire territory between 
the towns, with the town gates, left open for the time of the game, 
as the goals. To drive or carry the ball through one of these 
goals symbolized the capture of the gate or fortress. Each team 
defended its own gate, and thus arose the custom of considering a 
goal in these games as belonging to the team that defends it. 
In basket ball the goal is said to belong to the team attacking it, 
since the historical connection is here entirely lost in this new game. 
It will be noticed that the use of the word “goal” is here its usual 
meaning, indicating the end or place one plans to reach, while in 
166
-P-A-G-E-179
      
  TEAM GAMES—BASKET BALL TYPE 167 
the older games of football and hockey it has opposite meaning 
because of its early history. 
The Field. 
Basket ball can be played on any free space not exceeding 50 by 
go feet. The boundaries according to the rules, should be at all 
points at least three feet from any obstruction, but this distance 
should be increased at the ends, as players often run out of bounds 
at full speed after attempting a shot for the basket. The field is 
marked as shown in the diagram. The goals are metal rings 18 
inches in diameter and placed horizontally 10 feet above the floor. 
The ball is round and between 30 and 32 inches in circumference. 
The goals are attached to rigid backboards 4 by 6 feet.

168 THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
The Play. 
The object of the game is to throw the ball into your goal as many 
times as possible and to prevent the opponents from throwing it 
into theirs. The ball may be batted, rolled, bounced, or thrown in 
any direction with one or both hands; but players are not allowed to 
run with it, kick it, or strike it with closed fists. 
In making a dribble, pass, or throw for goal, the ball must leave 
the hands as the rear foot leaves the floor. Otherwise a foul is to 
be called for “‘advancing with the ball.” 
Scoring. 
A goal thrown from the field during play counts 2 points. The 
penalty for fouls in basket ball is a free throw for the goal from a 
distance of 15 feet. A goal thrown in this way scores 1 point. If 
a foul is committed against an offensive player while he is in the 
goal zone, two free throws are awarded to the offended team. 
A game is won by the team scoring the greatest number of points 
in two halves of 20 minutes each. Time of halves may be lessened 
by mutual agreement, and in games between boys of high school age 
and younger, the game is divided into ten or eight minute quarters. 
If the score is a tie when the game is called, a five minute overtime 
period is played. If still a tie, another five minute period is added, 
and so on. 
Officials. 
The officia:s in basket ball are a referee, an umpire, a scorer, and 
a timekeeper. 
The referee is the superior officer of the game. He sees that the 
goals, ball, and grounds are according to the rules, puts the ball in 
play, decides at all times to whom it belongs and where, and has 
power to call any foul. He has among his duties the notifying of 
the scorer when a goal is made, notifying the scorer and the offender 
whenever a foul is made, and the disqualifying of players committing 
four personal fouls, or certain flagrant fouls against the person 
of a player, as designated by the rules. 
The umpire has in general an oversight over the men rather than 
the ball, but he may call any foul except three or four specially re- 
served for decision of the referee. He watches the background, 
allowing the referee to follow the ball closely. 
The scorer records the score under the direction of the referee. 
The timekeeper notes when the game starts and blows his whistle
-P-A-G-E-181
TEAM GAMES—BASKET BALL TYPE 169 
at the expiration of the proper time for the half. He also takes 
out time when directed to do so by the referee. 
Teams. 
Five men constitute a team, divided into two “forwards,” one 
“center,” and two “backs” or “guards.” The special duty of the 
forwards is the throwing of goals. The guards oppose the forwards 
of the opposing team and pass the ball to their own forwards or 
center whenever they can get possession of it. The center has 
all-round duties, assisting the forwards when his own team has the 
ball, and the guards when the opponents have possession of it. 
Substitutes. 
A person may be substituted for one of the regular players. The 
person going into the game must report to the scorer, giving his 
name, number, and position, and must wait until the ball is dead 
before going on the playing floor. He must then be recognized by 
the referee. A player taken from the game may re-enter it once. 
Toss-Up. 
The ball is put in play at the beginning of the game by a play 
called “toss-up.” One player from each team, known as the 
“center,” stands in the small circle in the center of the field facing 
his own goal, and the referee tosses the ball up between them. 
When the ball reaches its highest point the referee blows his whistle. 
This is the signal for the two centers to jump upward and try to 
bat the ball with the open hand. The other hand’ must be held 
behind the back during this play. Neither of the centers may catch 
the ball until it has first been batted by one or the other of them. 
The ball is put in play by a toss-up at the center of the field 
after each goal thrown, at the beginning of each half and quarter, 
and in case of certain technical violations of the free throw rules, 
and after a double foul. When the ball is held momentarily by 
two players of opposite teams, the referee stops the play and starts 
it again by a toss-up at the spot where the ball was held. The same 
play is used when the referee is unable to decide to whom the ball 
rightfully belongs, which is frequently the case on out-of-bound balls. 
Passing the Ball. 
The greater part of the play in basket ball consists in passing the 
ball. Since opponents are guarding both the thrower and the man 
 
-P-A-G-E-182
170 THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
to whom the ball is thrown, considerable skill is required. The 
thrower must be able to see the men of his own side, decide to whom 
the ball can best be passed and to what spot it must be thrown, and 
then make the throw, all in an instant. A distinctive uniform is a 
great help in this respect. Some teams pass the ball most often by 
a low throw or bound on the floor, while others prefer a high 
overhead game; to be most successful, players must master all 
styles of play. 
Dribbling. 
Sometimes instead of passing the ball to another, a player ad- 
vances it by bouncing it on the floor or tossing it in the air while 
running down the floor. This is called “dribbling.” Dribbling may 
enable a single star player to play an individual game, leaving the 
other players little or nothing to do. In addition it may lead to 
roughness, as the opponents will charge the dribbler to stop him. 
To prevent such occurrences the rules for men put a limitation on 
dribbling as follows: As soon as the ball comes to rest in one or 
both hands or touches both hands simultaneously the dribble is 
ended; the player must then throw for goal or pass the ball to 
another. 
The Ball is Dead. 
The ball is dead and play stops temporarily when, (1) a goal is 
made, (2) when the ball goes out of bounds, (3) when a held ball 
or “time out” is declared, or (4) a foul is called. In all such cases 
the referee indicates the manner of starting play. In 1, he brings 
it to center; in 2, he awards it to one team out of bounds; in 3, he 
tosses the ball between the two players; and in 4, he places it upon 
the foul line. 
Time Out. 
Time out is called by the referee when a player is injured or 
upor request of either captain. The game must be resumed within 
two minutes. If time out is called when the ball is in bounds then 
play recommences by tossing the ball up between the two players 
(one from each team) who were nearest the spot when the game 
was halted If time out is called when a player has the ball out of
-P-A-G-E-183
  TEAM GAMES—BASKET BALL TYPE 171 
bounds, then it is given to the same player to throw in after the 
time-out period is up. 
If a team asks for “time out”? more than three times during a 
game, the captain of that team is charged with a technical foul. 
Out of Bounds. 
A ball is out of bounds when it touches the boundary line or the 
floor outside, or when a player has the ball and any part of his 
body touches the boundary line or the floor outside of the boundary 
line. A ball hitting the braces that support the backboard is 
also out of bounds. A ball out of bounds is put in play by a player 
on the opposite team from the one who touched it last before going 
over the line, at the point where it went out. He is allowed 5 sec- 
ends of time to throw it, and his opponent is not permitted to stand 
nearer than three feet to guard him. The player throwing the ball 
in may not touch it again until it has first been touched by another 
player. 
Throwing Goals. 
Throwing goals from the field is the most difficult and also the 
most important part of the game. Since each forward is opposed 
by a man who is selected because of his skill in guarding, quick 
work is necessary. The most successful goal throwers use several 
distinctive kinds of throws with one or both hands. A player hav- 
ing a free throw stands on the 15 foot line to make the throw. 
He must throw the ball within ten seconds. He must not cross 
the line until the ball has touched the basket or the backboard. All 
other players must stand outside the foul area, and are likewise 
restricted in that they cannot step inside this area until the ball has 
hit the basket or the backboard. If a player of the shooting side 
violates this rule, the basket, if made, does not count, and whether 
it is made or missed, the ball is put in play at the center. If a de- 
fensive player violates this rule, the basket if made counts, and if 
not made, the thrower is given a second trial. 
Violations and Fouls. 
Certain technical fouls dealing with minor infractions, instead of 
allowing a free throw are penalized by having the ball go into the 
free possession of the opponents out of bounds at the nearest side 
line. These are known as violations and are starred in the list
-P-A-G-E-184
172 THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
below. Those that deal with technical fouls infringing slightly on 
the best sportsmanship of the game allow a free throw. 
1. *Advancing with the ball. 
2. *Violating jumping rule, such as catching the ball instead of 
batting it on a toss-up; not holding one hand in contact 
with the back, etc. 
3. Interfering with a throw-in from out of bounds. 
4. *Passing the ball to a player out of bounds. 
5. Delaying the game, such as asking-for more than three time- 
outs during the game, retaining a ball that has been 
awarded the opponents. 
6. Interfering with the ball when in or on the basket. 
7. *Making a second dribble. 
8. Entering the game without being recognized by the referee. 
9. Talking to officials (except captain). 
10. Coaching from side lines. 
11. Going on the court during the game. 
Six types of personal fouls are specified. For these the penalty 
is a free throw, and the player is charged with a personal foul. 
The penalty is made severer than in the case of a technical foul, 
by removing a player from the game after he has made four 
personal fouls. 
To hold, block, trip, charge, push, or use unnecessary roughness 
of any description causes one to be charged with a personal foul. 
A penalty zone is created by drawing a line across the court seven- 
teen feet from the end line. Any personal foul committed within 
this penalty zone by a defending player gives the opposite side 
two free throws. 
Double Fouls. 
It sometimes happens that a player from each team will make 
fouls simultaneously. Each team is given a free throw and the ball 
is put in play at the center after the second throw, whether the 
basket was made or missed. Again, it may happen that the same 
team will make two fouls at the same time. The opposing team 
is then given two free throws. In case the second shot is not made, 
the ball is in play.
-P-A-G-E-185
TEAM GAMES—BASKET BALL TYPE 173 
2. Basket Ball for Women 
General Description. 
This is a game developed out of the men’s game and first played 
at Smith College. It is played by two teams of six players each. 
The field has one or two cross lines dividing it into equal sections, 
and for this reason this type of game is often called the “‘line game.” 
Each team endeavors to put the ball in its own basket and, at the 
same time, tries to keep the opponents from getting possession of 
the ball and making a basket. The officials have the same duties 
as in the boys’ game. The game is played in two halves of 10 to 15 
minutes each, with a rest of 10 minutes between halves. With 
immature girls, it is better to play quarters of seven or eight 
minutes, with two minutes rest in the additional intermissions. In 
case the score is tied at the end of the second half, overtime play 
is continued until one team makes two additional points. 
The Players. 
Each team consists of a right and left forward, a right and left 
guard, a jumping center and side center. The players must remain 
in their own divisions of the field. 
Main Differences from the Boys’ Game. 
It has been shown that the object of the game, and the general 
features of scoring and play, resemble the game of basket ball as 
played by boys. The changes that stand out prominently, i.¢., the 
shorter playing halves, the division of the floor into two or three 
parts, and the addition of the sixth player, are included with the 
purpose of cutting down the running and making the game less 
strenuous. There are other important differences which aim to 
prevent roughness and personal contact—the women’s game re- 
quires two hands to secure the ball, which prevents snatching or 
batting it from the hands of another player; also limits the dribble 
to one bounce which eliminates much of the charging that is found 
in the boys’ game; and it also requires that the arms be held in 
a vertical position in guarding. 
There are other minor differences listed under their respective 
headings. 
Toss-Up. 
The game is started by tossing the ball up between the two jump- 
ing centers, who stand facing their own baskets within the circle 
 
-P-A-G-E-186
174 THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
in the center of the floor. Each tries to bat it to one of her own 
team, usually the side center. Neither of the centers may catch 
the ball after batting it until it has touched the floor or has been 
played by another player. 
Advancing the Ball. 
It is the object of each team to keep the ball in its possession by 
quickly passing it from one player to another of her own team, 
gradually working the ball to the forwards, who, when in range, 
try to put it-in the basket. A ball may be either thrown or bounced 
to another player, but may not be rolled, kicked, hit with the fist, 
or handed to another player. 
In addition to bouncing and throwing the ball to another player, a 
player may bounce the ball once and catch it again herself, called 
dribbling. In doing this, the bottom of the ball must come as high 
as the knee. A player may also juggle the ball once, i.e., toss it in 
the air and catch it again herself. A dribble cannot follow a juggle; 
and vice versa. 
In not allowing the ball to be rolled on the floor, to be handed 
to a teammate, or to be bounced against the floor more than once, 
the girls’ rules place restrictions on advancing the ball. There is 
no dribble in the sense that the boys use it. Another limitation 
that is not included in the boys’ rules is that the player must throw 
the ball within three seconds after receiving it. 
Scoring. 
A basket made from the field counts two points with one excep- 
tion; a basket from a two-handed overhead shot counts but one 
point. A basket made from a free throw counts one point. 
Fouls. 
All fouls (line fouls excepted) give the opposing team a free 
throw from the 15 foot line. Fouls are divided into two main 
classes. 
(a) Personal Fouls. 
These are fouls in which there is personal contact. Specifically 
they are: Holding, blocking, tripping, pushing, or overguarding 
an opponent so that personal contact is made. 
Note. If a player overguards or makes a personal foul against 
a player who is trying for a basket, the forward is given two free 
throws instead of one as in other cases.  
-P-A-G-E-187
  
  TEAM GAMES—BASKET BALL TYPE 175 
(b) Technical Fouls. 
These are fouls in which there is no personal contact. 
Advancing with the ball. 
Snatching or batting the ball from hands of an opponent. 
Kicking the ball or striking it with the fist. 
Rolling the ball or handing it to another player. 
Bouncing or juggling the ball twice or more in succession. 
Coaching from the side lines. 
Delaying the game. 
Touching ball after it has eek awarded to an opponent. 
Failing to rise promptly after falling down. 
Failing to stand in circle promptly for toss-up. 
Catching the ball on the toss-up, or otherwise violating the 
jumping rules. 
Holding the ball more than 3 seconds within bounds. 
Holding the ball more than 10 seconds when throwing a foul. 
8. Passing the ball to another player while making a free throw 
for goal. 
9. Going on the floor as a substitute before reporting to scorer 
and to referee. 
10. Overguarding opponent not throwing for basket. 
Overguarding opponent who is throwing for basket. (Two 
shots. ) 
Line Fouls. 
A line foul consists in stepping over the field line or touching the 
floor over the line ‘with any part of the body. The opponent of the 
player making the foul is given an unguarded throw to another 
player from the place where the foul was made. Sometimes it 
happens that one player from each team will step over the line. 
In that case the ball is tossed up between the two players at the place 
where the foul was made. 
Players Disqualified. 
A player is disqualified after she has made four personal or 
five technical fouls, or sum total of six fouls of any kind. She is 
warned after the third personal and fourth technical. A player is 
also disqualified for unnecessary roughness. 
Time Out. 
Practically the same as under boys’ rules, except that five minutes 
are allowed before the game must be resumed. -- See ae
-P-A-G-E-188
  176 THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
Other Rules. 
The rules applying to double fouls, out of bounds, substitutes, 
and free throw, are the same as explained under the boys’ rules. 
3. Minor Basket Ball Games 
Newcomb. 
Divide the players into two groups of as near equal ability as 
possible. Stretch a rope or tennis net across the middle of the 
basket ball court at a height of six or eight feet, and send one team 
to each side. Decide on the length of time for play, and instruct the 
timekeeper to call ‘time’ at the end of each half. Give the ball 
for first throw to one team first half and to the other the second. 
The scorer marks scores as called by the umpire. The players 
throw the ball over the rope trying to make it strike in unguarded 
places in the opponents’ territory. The opponents try to catch the 
ball if it is going to hit the floor in their part of the field but leave 
it alone if it is going out of bounds. A ball striking the floor counts 
for the thrower’s side, unless a foul is made. It is a foul to hit 
the rope or to throw the ball under the rope or out of bounds, and 
each foul counts a score for the other side. If any player touches 
the ball, he is then responsible for catching it, and cannot claim 
that it was going out. The player getting the ball throws it back, 
trying to make a score and to avoid fouling. Change sides for 
the second half. The team having the most scores at the end of 
the second half wins. This game cultivates ability to throw and 
catch, to move quickly about the floor, and to judge where a ball 
will fall. Place the young and timid players in front near the rope; 
those who like swift throws should stand back. 
End Ball. 
Draw a line across the basket ball court about 4 feet from each 
end, and place in this narrow space four or five players belonging 
to the team stationed in the opposite half of the field. The rope 
is not used, but a line is drawn across the middle of the floor. 
Players of each team make scores by throwing the ball over the 
heads of the opponents so that it can be caught by the “basemen” 
who stand in the narrow space at the opposite end. Basemen 
getting the ball throw it back for another play, but the return 
catch does not count a score. When opponents get the ball they 
throw to their basemen in the same way. Officials are the same as
-P-A-G-E-189
  
TEAM GAMES—BASKET BALL TYPE 177 
in Newcomb. This game gives practice in throwing accurately to 
a player of your own side, in catching while opponents stand near 
to guard, in guarding, and in keeping in your own space. Players 
out of bounds forfeit the ball if they have it; if they do not have 
the ball, a foul gives a score to the others. 
Captain Ball. 
Draw as many 3-foot circles on the floor as there are players on 
one side. Make these smaller circles form a large circle forma- 
tion. Place half the players of each side in circles, and place the 
others without the circles to act as guards for the opponents within. 
Play begins by tossing up the ball between the two guards nearest 
the center. Any player getting the ball throws it to a baseman 
of his side. Every time a baseman catches a ball thrown to him by 
his side a score is counted for that side. There is this limitation: 
a baseman can make a score but once until opponents have played 
the ball. Each baseman may score in turn and the captain catching 
the ball after the baseman has had it counts two. Fouls forfeit the 
ball if you have possession of it, and count score for the opponents 
if you do not have it. When all the basemen of one side have 
caught the ball it is tossed up again as at first, except that different 
guards are used each time. Rules of basket ball, such as running 
with the ball, striking the ball while in the hands of a player, and 
rough play are enforced. A foul is charged against the baseman 
for stepping out of his circle with both feet at the same time; and 
against the guard for stepping into the baseman’s circle with either 
foot. There are many varieties of captain ball: some place the 
captain’s circle in the center of the others; some count a score only 
when the ball reaches the captain. In the latter case, a throw from 
one baseman to the captain counts one point; a throw which takes 
in two basemen and the captain successively counts two.points; etc. 
It adds interest to the game to interchange the basemen and guards 
the second half. 
Keep Ball. 
Arrange equal sides, so dressed or marked as to be easily told. 
Each side tries to keep the ball. Every successful pass from one 
player to another of the same side counts a score for that side. The 
usual rules of basket ball apply. The tendency is for too much 
violent exercise, and this may be lessened by placing teams in divi- 
sions of the field as marked out for basket ball for women.

    178 THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
Cage Ball. + 
Cage ball is a game of the basket ball group which is played with 
a large inflated ball 24 to 30 inches in diameter and weighing four 
pounds. A large field isneeded. The game was originally intended 
for use by large groups in the army and navy camps. The object of 
the game is to keep the ball overhead, advance it toward one’s own 
goal and finally deposit it in a large net which is suspended ten feet 
from the ground at the end line. On account of the size, the ball 
is pushed overhead, rather than passed. 
The inventor of the game, Emmett D. Angell, has since adapted 
this ball to many original games and relays which he has devised 
for playground and gymnasium use.

CHAPTER XVI 
PLAY FOR SPECIAL OCCASIONS 
The preceding chapters have given the standard material for 
play programs suited to groups of moderate size where the players 
are of the same age and sex and of similar physical abilities, as in 
school, college, playground, or scout camp. Certain occasions, such 
as picnics, parties, celebrations, exhibitions, and outings bring to- 
gether mixed crowds of people who are not all physically vigorous 
enough nor suitably dressed to take part in all these activities, and 
yet something must be done for fun and entertainment. Many of 
the activities described in this book can with a little variation be 
made to fill this need admirably, and a few others that have been 
found effective will be given here as samples of the play needed for 
such occasions. ‘Two plans are used: first, the selecting of plays 
which the whole crowd can take part in and enjoy; second, the 
selecting of a few players who perform for the entertainment 
of the others. 
In addition to games of this kind we also give at the end of this 
chapter some description of handicrafts, nature lore, and story-tell- 
ing; these, although different from the standard types of play 
activity, are yet important features of playground practice that 
should not be omitted from a book of this kind.* 
Plays Suitable for Mixed Groups 
Rhythmic Plays. 
It is often easy to get a crowd engaged in playing some of the 
children’s forms of play, especially theesong plays. The familiar 
“Farmer in the Dell,” “Jolly is the Miller,” “London Bridge,” 
“Roman Soldier,” and “Did You Ever See a Lassie,” as well as 
others, will nearly always please. 
Individual Contests. 
It is all right to include a few of the standard dashes; but these 
furnish extreme rivalry and excitement rather than fun, and it is 
the latter that is wanted for informal occasions. The latter pur-

180 THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
pose can be served by making up variations of the well-known 
events. The Obstacle Race is familiar; so is the Three-Legged Race. 
Other ideas can be found in the Hopping Race, the Zigzag Race, 
the Horse and Rider Race, the Blindfold Race, the Somersault 
Race, the Chariot Race (a team of four either holding hands, or 
running abreast behind a small pole) and the Human Wheelbar- 
row Race, in which one person clasps about the waist a second 
person who walks on his hands. In races of this kind the distance 
must not be made too long. 
Group Contests. 
Those of the type that are listed in Chapter V nearly always 
can be adapted to the use which is being discussed: in par- 
ticular, Overhead Relay, Fetch and Carry, Over and Under Relay, 
and Arch Goal Ball. Boys like to vary the overhead relay by 
crouching over in a continuous line, and passing the ball between 
their legs. This is called Straddle-Ball Relay. Another variation 
they will like is the combination of the overhead and underleg 
game, the front man starting the ball over his head, and the 
second man bringing it down and between his legs. The ball thus 
alternates until it reaches the end of the line. Many interesting 
events can also be made up of the shuttle relays. 
Tag Games. 
These are occasionally found useful, especially those forms where 
an unusual posture is required, such as ‘‘Posture Tag,” “Statue 
Tag,” or “Japanese Tag.” The ring variety, like “Three Deep” 
must also be mentioned. Then, too, the game of “Dodge Ball,” 
bringing in throwing as well as running, gives social fun. 
Goal Games. 
Under this heading must be mentioned games such as “Marching 
to Jerusalem,” “The Beater Goes Round,” and similar ones. 
Some of these are adaptable to indoor use. 
Personal Combats. 
The novelty element can be very easily inserted into the personal 
combat. Such variations as have already been given, as the ‘Rooster 
Fight,” “Chicken Fight,” and “Badger Pull” always provoke 
laughter. Mounted boxing, and tilting on barrels or on the water, 
serve the same purpose. \

PLAY FOR SPECIAL OCCASIONS 181 
Ball Games. 
If an informal gathering is being held, the standard ball game 
should furnish the element of burlesque by having the sides com- 
posed of Fat Men and Lean Men, or Married Men and Single, or 
in some other like manner. The games should not be too long, but 
should only furnish a small part of the program of the day’s outing. 
Additional Suggestions 
A number of successful novelties that will serve the crowd that 
happens to be in “less serious vein” are given below. 
Crab Race or Relay. 
This can be used as a race for individuals or for a relay race in 
which teams of six or eight compete. The individuals have their 
heels touch the starting line, and brace themselves from behind 
with their hands to the floor. The back is to the floor. At the 
signal, they advance to the opposite line 30 feet away with feet 
foremost in this manner. After reaching the farther goal, they 
return to the starting point, except that this time the hands lead 
the way. The next player then starts, and so on until the whole 
team has completed the trip. 
Skin the Snake Relay. i 
_ Teams of eight or more are needed. Each of the men in line 
puts his left hand back between his legs where it is grasped by the 
right hand of the man behind him. At the signal, the rear man 
lies down on his back, still holding to the hand of the man ahead. 
The line moves backward, each new rear man lying down. When 
the whole line is flat on the ground, the last man to assume this 
position arises and leads the file in the return race to assume its 
feet. The file must continue to hold hands until it has become up- 
right and has reached the finish line. 
Basket Ball Relay. 
A game that causes laughter is the Basket Ball Relay. One goal 
is needed. The teams line up at a starting point a short distance 
from the goal. It is best to have four or more teams. At the signal 
the first player of each team runs and tries to throw the ball through 
the basket, then to return to give a chance to the next in line. The 
fun comes from the fact that there are several balls in the air at 
the same time, and they will keep interfering with each other, and
-P-A-G-E-194
Te ee ne er ie eae 
182 THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
each time that this happens the respective players will have to run 
and retrieve the balls. 
Croquet Relay. 
The teams line up in file behind a starting point. The mallet 
heads are on the floor or ground, the handle being separated and 
in the hands of the leading players. The object is to roll the mallet 
head to a given point and return, whereupon the second player 
makes the race. As the mallet head will not roll straight forward, 
but will swerve in any number of directions, a good deal of un- 
certainty is provided. The steering must be done with the handles 
held perpendicular to the ground, 
Thread and Needle Race. 
Six or more women stand at a line holding needles in their hands. 
The same number of men run from a given point at a command, 
, each provided with a piece of thread. The object is to thread the 
needle held in the air by the partner and to return to the starting 
point. The first to reach it wins the race. 
Laughing Relay. 
Two teams face each other. The one drawing first chance has 
thirty seconds to perform antics that will make the other side 
laugh. All opponents laughing are recruited to the first side. After 
time is up the second side gets its chance. A certain number of 
tries can be allowed each side, after which the game is called, and 
the larger side wins. This contest can be performed in the manner 
of a spell-down. Individuals alternate in making an opponent 
laugh. The one to stand up the longest without laughing wins. 
Burden Race. 
The idea is to race encumbered by a number of awkward articles 
that will impede one’s progress. At the first stop the runner must 
pick up a chair; at the next, a long pole; at the next, a basket ball. 
He then starts to return over the same course where at each stop 
he must pick up another article. 
Clothespin Race. 
A number of women are each given a pan with six ordinary 
clothespins in it. At a very short distance away, a clothesline is 
suspended. The race is to pin the clothespins, one at each trip, to
-P-A-G-E-195
  
PLAY FOR SPECIAL OCCASIONS 183 
the line; to make this more difficult one hand must be kept behind 
the back. The first returning to the starting point—showing all 
six pins fastened to the line—wins. The jolting of the line adds 
to the difficulties, 
Barnyard Music. 
A noisy stunt for the party. Each member is given the name of 
an animal which he must imitate. At the given signal, each shouts 
his part: one, the crowing rooster; one, the barking dog; another, 
the neighing horse; and so on. An amusing variation of this is 
made by selecting one member for the victim. At the signal, every 
member remains quiet except the one who has been assigned to bray 
like a donkey, 
Pillow Fight. 
Two men are blindfolded‘and furnished with a heavy pillow for 
one hand and a noisy rattle in the other. They endeavor to hit 
each other with the pillows, locating each other by the sound of 
the rattle. Unbeknown to the two contestants the director also 
has a rattle, and soon he confuses them by shaking it. It adds to 
the fun if he can lead them over to where the crowd is seated, and 
soon there will be a wild scampering from the seats, 
Marshmallow Fight. 
Two men are seated facing each other, and blindfolded. Before 
they are blindfolded they are each given a pan or box of marsh- 
mallows and told that the race is to see which can make the 
opponent eat the most of them in a given time. After they have 
been blindfolded, the marshmallows are covered with lamp black. 
At the signal they begin to feed each other with the result that they 
are blackening each other’s faces all the while. The fun reaches 
a climax when the bandages are removed and the opponents see 
each other, 
Paddle Guess. 
Two men get under a blanket, with the remainder of the group 
assembled about them in a circle. The idea is to slap one of the 
two men with a paddle, then have him uncover and guess who hit 
him. The trick of the game is that one of the two men is “‘in on the 
trick” and by reaching out from under the blanket is obtaining the 
paddle and actually doing the slapping. After each slap, the men
-P-A-G-E-196
    184 THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
in the circle hide their hands behind their backs, enjoying the guess- 
ing attempts of the victim. Occasionally the slapper should hit 
himself, yell, and make a guess. This carries out the deception. 
Milling the Man. 
The players seat themselves in a circle. The man who is “it” 
is inthe center. With arms at sides, and body rigid, he falls toward 
one of the seated men. The latter attempts to keep the falling man 
upright. In this way the man who is “‘it”’ is passed back and forth 
in all directions among the group. If he falls so as to touch the 
body of any seated man, the latter becomes “‘it.” 
Dancing Dwarf. 
A camp stunt. Two men compose the act. Both stand with 
their bodies concealed from the audience. The nearest man sticks 
his head and hands out through an opening, most often a flap of a 
tent. On his hands are shoes. He rests these fake feet on a table 
outside and used for the act. The deception is completed by the 
rear partner, who sticks his arms out from behind, and inside of 
the first man’s. The dwarf can then be made to play an instru- 
ment by means of the second man’s hands; or he can be made to 
give another trick in the way of a dance, the steps being made by 
the first man’s hands inside the shoes, 
Magical Tree. 
A flower pot, which appears to the audience as being empty, can 
suddenly sprout a small evergreen tree. Inside the flower pot is 
the branch attached upright to a cork. Water is poured slowly 
into the pot as the magician talks and waves his wand, and this 
makes the tree appear above the top and to the sight of the audience. 
Houdini. 
The performer gets out of a bag which has been tied in all sorts 
of knots by the accompanying partner. The trick is this. There 
are two bags, the inner one remaining collapsed. The performer 
gets into the outer bag; his partner then ties a few loose knots at 
the top of it. Without the audience seeing him he draws out the 
top of the inner bag and ties the real tight knots about it. When 
the curtain goes down, the performer pulls on the inner bag and 
in a moment he is free. The curtain then rises again and he dis- 
plays himself to the audience.
-P-A-G-E-197
  
  PLAY FOR SPECIAL OCCASIONS 185 
Earth, Air, Fire, Water. 
The players are seated ina circle. One of the number is “‘it” and 
calls out ‘Earth’ and throws a knotted handkerchief at some one, 
at the same time counting ten. The person who receives the 
handkerchief must give the name of some animal before ten counts 
are completed; if “Air” is called out, a bird must be named; if 
“Water,” a fish: but if “Fire” is called out the one receiving the 
handkerchief must remain silent. Confusion is easily wrought in 
this game and no one remains “it” very long. 
The Country Grocery Store. 
The players are in a circle. One begins the game by saying, “I 
went to the country grocery store and bought some “Apples”; the 
next one, “Apples, Beets”; the next one “Apples, Beets, Carrots”; 
etc. Each performer must “buy” some article in the Country 
Grocery Store but must repeat all articles purchased by those pre- 
ceding him on penalty of dropping out of the game. The idea is 
to run through the alphabet and see how many are still able to 
repeat the list and add new ones by the time the alphabet is gone 
through. If a player omits an article, misnames, mixes the 
alphabet, or is unable to call to mind an article for his letter in two 
minutes, he drops out of the game. Usually the circle is unable to 
go through the alphabet. 
Squeak Baby. 
Several victims are selected and brought in the room one at a 
time. The director explains that there is a rubber squeak baby in 
the circle about the victim and that he must find it in the hands of 
some person. While the director is talking someone pins the rubber 
squeak baby attached to a short string to the coat tail of the victim 
and then everything is ready. When the victim’s back is turned 
someone presses the rubber doll and makes it squeak. The victim 
is kept whirling around until he guesses it to be on his back or 
is told. 
Ring On the String. 
The group is seated in a circle with one person in the center 
who is “it.” A continuous string with a ring on it is in the hands of 
each person. All keep moving their hands toward their partners’ 
and make believe they are passing the ring so as to cover up the 
actual passing by someone else. When one is caught with the ring 
on the string between or in his hands he becomes “‘it.”” 
 
-P-A-G-E-198
  186 THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
Birds Have Feathers. 
This is an interesting variation of “Earth, Air, Fire, Water.” 
The leader throws up his hands every time he mentions a bird or 
animal. The players all follow him whenever he mentions a 
feathered animal. When he mentions a species which have no 
feathers, however, the players must keep their hands upon their 
knees. The object is to catch players unawares by naming birds 
very rapidly and then introducing animals that have no feathers. 
For instance: ‘Sparrows have feathers’—everyone puts up his 
hands; “Hawks have feathers’”—all hands up; “Rats have feath- 
ers’—leader’s hands alone are up. The one who is caught may be 
forced to act as leader, dropped out of the game, or be made to 
pay a forfeit. 
Charades. 
Much fun may be had also by dividing the group into two or more 
lesser groups and having them give charades. The best way is to 
limit the charade to a definite group of words like names of cities, 
Indian tribes, great men, etc. A group is permitted to continue 
acting until its charade is guessed and then another group begins. 
It is best not to make the names too difficult. 
Water Events 
These come in handy for the swimming pool or the camp. Simi- 
larly, as the novelty element can be added to the standard races 
- and relays by inventing variations of them, so it can be added to 
the customary water races and relays and the boating contests. 
For instance, there can be an obstacle race in which the swimmers 
must dive under a canoe, change strokes, carry a burden a specified 
distance, climb onto a float, etc., ending by dressing and appearing 
at the goal on land. Again, there is a race in which each contest- 
ant must swim a distance with a spoon in his mouth and a potato 
balanced on the spoon. A novelty canoe or boat race is one in 
which the contestants must paddle with their hands. The canoe 
tilting and the log rolling contests are familiar to any one who has 
lived near the water. 
Many of the popular games can be adapted to use in the water. 
Nearly all the forms of tag can be used, even in the ordinary 
swimming pool of a fairly good sized area. Blow Ball is a game 
where a light inflated ball is blown toward the competitor’s goal.
-P-A-G-E-199
  PLAY FOR SPECIAL OCCASIONS 187 
The same idea is carried out in a game called Water Cage Ball, 
in which a more substantial ball is pushed, batted, or thrown towards 
the opponents’ goal. Some of our well-known team games like base- 
ball, basket ball, etc., have been carried out in principle in modifica- 
tions suitable for water use. Some of these modifications have been 
very simple and made to suit the occasion; however, there are 
games thus invented which are now found in school competition 
and for which the rules have been published. 
The swimming guides contain the rules of Water Polo, Water 
Baseball, and Water Basket Ball. In Water Polo a special inflated 
leather-covered ball, between 7 or 8 inches in diameter, is used. 
The object is to touch or throw the ball against a goal which is 
4 feet in length and 8 inches in height and located at the end 
of the pool 12 inches above the water level. A thrown ball in 
order to count, must be started from the 15-foot line. There are 
six players toa team. Two halves of eight minutes are played. A 
touch goal counts five points and a thrown goal counts three. In 
addition, there is a free throw goal after a foul. This counts one 
point, and is made by an unguarded throw from the 15-foot line. 
The play starts from center but after a goal is made the defending 
side puts the ball in play. 
In Water Basket Ball the same ball as above is used. The 
object is to put the ball in a suspended basket which is 5% feet 
above the water. Six players compose a team. They line up at 
their respective ends. The play starts by throwing the ball into 
the center of the tank. This procedure is followed after a score 
is made. A goal counts two and a free throw from the 15-foot 
line counts one. Eight minute halves are played. 
Water Baseball uses a diamond the dimensions of the play- 
ground baseball game, with 35-foot baselines. The ball is 12 inches 
in diameter and of cork covered with waterproof duck. The field- 
ing team has a float for each position. The base runner may swim 
or dive to advance. He may lead off base as in outdoor baseball. 
Handicraft, Nature Lore, and Story-Telling 
These activities are good to use with little tots who have been 
playing about almost all day and are tired. They also help to 
attract some children who at first would not come to the play- 
ground for the more vigorous plays and games. They may be used 
to advantage when it is raining, close after the noon hour when it 
is hot, and at other times late in the day when the children have 
 
-P-A-G-E-200
188 THE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
been running about until they are tired. Stories may be told while 
play is going on at the sand bins. Too much time should not be 
given to these activities because they are of the type that children 
have at home and at school. 
Handicraft is one of the other forms of play education through 
which the child learns by doing. The making of an article furnishes 
a chance to exercise the mind in an instructive as well as enter- 
taining way. The child’s inventiveness is taxed. Ambition is 
stimulated to reach a desired end; and, in addition, the child learns 
to be skilful with his hands. 
Both boys and girls should be encouraged to give expression to 
their own ideas along these lines and should be furnished plenty of 
material to work with. In general, boys like to make toys and 
articles for their outdoor play: for instance, kites, toy boats, sleds, 
wagons, animal houses, tops, balls, bows and arrows, whistles, stilts, 
guns; and, as they get older, household articles, camp furniture, 
to splice ropes and tie all kinds of knots, and to fuss with mechanical 
and electrical contrivances. The present day boy is inevitably found 
with his aero and radio outfits. The interests of girls vary widely. 
They prefer rather to make articles useful for the home or as 
gifts. A suggested list follows: dolls and doll clothing, decorative 
furnishings for the doll house, valentines, calendars, beads, raffia, 
and paper decorations; and, for the older girls, doilies, pillows, 
baskets, pin cushions, picture frames, caps and aprons, costumes 
for dancing and dramatics, and any forms of fancy work in which 
they can show their skill in sewing, stitching, knitting, crocheting,. 
embroidering, tatting, etc. For artistic work along slightly different 
lines, the older girls can easily be interested in painting pictures and 
dishes, in burnt woodwork, and in gilding and silvering weeds. 
On the playground the older boys make good helpers in setting 
up playground apparatus, clearing grounds, laying out ball fields 
and running tracks, and marking the tennis courts. Girls can con- 
tribute in the making of beanbags, felt emblems and pennants, and 
the mending of ball covers and nets. While the girls have never 
been encouraged until very recently in woodcraft, interest is arising 
in connection with their hikes and camping, and this has resulted 
in more outdoor life for them. 
Nature Lore. 
The study of Nature is another activity of purposeful play. 
It is more or less an occasional activity of the playground and is
-P-A-G-E-201
PLAY FOR SPECIAL OCCASIONS 189 
promoted through the special hikes to the country, through the 
encouragement and display of collections, through the developing 
of school and playground gardens, and probably most of all 
through the curricula of the Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, Campfire Girls, 
Audubon Society, and other boys’ and girls’ clubs. The schools 
have presented the subject in a textbook manner that has largely 
failed to keep the child’s interest. The play agencies encourage 
the child to acquaint himself with the outdoors at first hand, and 
thus combine an active feature with this education. 
When Nature study is carried on as an active pursuit, the child 
actually keeps a garden to know the soils, vegetables, plants, and 
flowers; keeps pets, and goes excursioning with a kodak in order 
to know the ways of animals and birds, and moths and butterflies; 
goes on hikes to add to his collection of leaves, flowers, ferns, shells 
and minerals and rocks, and to identify the various shrubs, trees, 
fruits, and berries; visits the large farm actually to see the life of 
the domesticated animals, and possibly to learn the ways of the bees. 
Moreover, trips to the museums and aquariums extend this knowl- 
edge. All these studies encourage an outdoor life and awaken in 
children a keen sense of observation. ‘Too, a lifelong interest in 
Nature is added. At home the child may keep collections of 
postage stamps and coins, and thereby add to his interest in geog- 
raphy and in the life and habits of people of foreign lands, 
Story-Telling. 
Little tots enjoy stories attached to the real life about them— 
the things which they see every day. They like to hear the experi- 
ences of other little children, and their mothers and fathers, and 
of “Peter Rabbits,” “Bobby Squirrels,” and “Little Red Hens.” 
Later they enjoy the more imaginative Fairy Tales, Greek and 
Norse Legends, and Biblical Tales. Older children want stories 
of travel and adventure, mystery, and biography. 
Stories must be told naturally and simply. Oratory and fine 
gestures are unnecessary. ‘The story-teller must see the picture 
clearly himself and speak plainly and quietly. He must feel the 
story and be interested init. It is best to get into the story promptly, 
without long introductions. There should be a definite beginning, 
continuous action, and a definite ending. The children like to point 
the moral themselves. Young children especially like stories in- 
volving repetition.

GENERAL BIBLIOGRAPHY 
A special list of books has already been given on Song Plays and Folk Dances 
at the end of chapter three; also, books suggesting programs of Novelty Games, 
Stunts, and Special Entertainments have been given in Chap. XVI. Chapter XVI 
also gives books on the subjects of Story-Telling, Handicraft, and Nature Study. 
Below is given a general bibliography covering the well known plays and games 
that are regularly used by all play teachers. Too, sources of information are given 
on more specialized forms of athletics so that the person wishing a technical knowledge 
of the rules and information on the strategy of coaching may also be helped. 
A rather complete list has been given so that the teachers having access only to the 
small libraries may find some books available.

Encourage all persons attending a center to enter into the various activities. Ask 
persons interested in the games to assume some degree of responsibility for the suc- 
cess of that activity. Know and disseminate information of the real greatness and 
purposes of the Department of Recreation, in order that the people may have a true 
understanding of what the Department is endeavoring to do. Conduct yourself in a

PREFACE 
It is more difficult to prepare a book on applied science 
than to write a book on pure science. Applied science 
touches so many fields of thought and action that there 
are twenty critics ready to point out difficulties where only 
one would appear against a volume on pure science. In 
the following pages I have been guilty of excursions into 
the territory of the teacher of English, into the stronghold 
of Latin, into the newly established domains of science and 
manual arts. I have made observations in these various 
quarters from the point of view of the psychologist. Many 
of these observations will be looked upon by my colleagues 
in psychology as unpsychological; many will be regarded 
by specialists in English, Latin, science, and the manual 
arts as biased’and ill-advised. It is the fate of anyone who 
attempts to contribute to applied science to draw upon 
himself abundant criticism. 
The only opportunity which one has of making a remark 
of a purely personal type being in the preface, I am con- 
strained to point out that it is not at all unlikely that many 
of the specialists who will say that I ought to keep within 
the bounds of my own field will unhesitatingly talk in 
psychological terms which they cannot justify. It would 
be easy to point to cases where psychology has been used 
but not applied, where the name of the science of education 
has been set up as a defense by those who are altogether 
unscientific. : 
Fortunately, however, the time has arrived when educa- 
tion is to be put on a broad, objective foundation. The

numerous books on high-school education which have pre- 
ceded this show that personal views are soon to be set aside 
in favor of more general and well-established principles. 
Whoever is able to state in an objective way the grounds 
of his beliefs about secondary-school problems has a right 
to speak, and to hope that the criticism which he receives 
will be directed toward his methods and his formulation 
of problems rather than toward his special views. It is in 
this hope that the following pages are offered. 
It would be difficult to acknowledge the contributions 
which have been made directly and indirectly to this vol- 
ume. Some years ago the author acted as inspector of 
high schools for the state board of education in Con- 
necticut and came into close and instructive contact with 
Secretary Hine and others who were engaged in developing 
secondary education in that state. For the past six years 
he has profited greatly from intimate association with Prin- 
cipal F. W. Johnson and the other members of the faculty 
of the high school conducted as a laboratory school in the 
School of Education of The University of Chicago. During 
the last four years he has learned much from a group of 
principals of high schools in and about Chicago who have 
admitted him each month to the informal meetings at which 
they canvass without restraint the problems of high-school 
teaching and organization. To all these the author is under 
special obligation. To the students who have been mem- 
bers of the classes in which this book has been gradually 
put in form the author’s obligations are larger than he is 
able adequately to acknowledge. The reports which have 
been handed in by members of these classes have been full 
of fruitful suggestions. Many other obligations of a less 
personal type are indicated by footnotes in the text.

CHAPTER I. INTRODUCTION . 
Educational psychology as a study of students. New motives for 
making such a study. The problems of such a study are to be 
found in the special subjects of instruction. Methods of collecting 
material. Scientific treatment of this material consists in analysis, 
comparison, and generalization.

EMATICS 
Evidences that the problems of instruction in mathematics are 
not solved. Historical reasons for present course. Problems of 
rearrangement and application. 
CHAPTER II. THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SPACE 
Space is a sensation-complex. As such its essential characteristics 
are not to be sought in content, but in its relational aspects. Genesis 
of space ideas. Space and movement. Mechanical elements of ma- 
ture space ideas. Space is a highly generalized phase of all expe- 
rience. As such it is the basis of a formal science. This science 
goes beyond the direct recognition of space. 
CHAPTER IV. THE PSYCHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF 
GEOMETRY 
Analysis of a typical textbook on geometry, showing the various 
devices employed to induce in students more and more elaborate 
judgments about space. Percepts of figures, abstraction, analysis, 
synthesis, comparison, logical treatment, demonstrations. Analysis 
of typical classroom activities. Modes of attacking problems; social 
interference ; various mental processes, especially memory and 
reasoning. Treatises on the theory of the teaching of mathematics.

CHAPTER XIX. GENERAL PROBLEMS OF SECOND- 
ARN FHIDUC ATION § 33500, ote oe ios ai 
High schools have become part of the common-school system. Rapid 
growth of high schools has led to internal readjustments of the 
most radical type: richer courses, adaptation of courses to local 
needs, and better adjustment to individual needs. Some of these 
changes are embarrassed by efforts to standardize. Elimination is 
not the present end in education, but rather vocational distribution 
and guidance. This is shown by contrast with foreign school sys- 
tems. Periodicity of development. Adolescence can be understood 
only when we comprehend the periods which precede it. Reorgan- 
ization of the secondary school so as to articulate it to insti- 
tutions above and below urgently needed. General principles of 
secondary education: the principle of broad training and the 
principle of concentration on some sequential line of study.

PSYCHOLOGY OF 
HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
CHAPTER I 
INTRODUCTION 
THE Strupy or STUDENTS’ CAPACITIES 
It would undoubtedly be easy to secure unanimous 
assent to the general assertion that the teacher ought to 
understand the mental processes of his students. Every 
beginner’s book in Latin or German, every volume, of 
selected source material in history, every carefully form 
lated introductory textbook in science, is concrete odes 
that the student as well as the subject to be taught is part 
of the teacher’s problem. If we attempt to push the argu- 
ment beyond this general suggestion, however, and insist 
that every high-school teacher should take courses which 
deal with the mental processes of his students, we en- 
counter a wall of objections. We are told that what 
teachers need is a more complete knowledge of the sub- 
jects they teach, that it is distracting and irrelevant to 
spend time on the study of mental processes. It is confi- 
dently affirmed that the teacher will in any case get some 
acquaintance with human nature through classroom expe- 
rience; roundabout, labored, theoretical studies are there- 
fore declared to be wasteful and unproductive. Finally, 
one hears the statement that students who are of the ma- 
turity of young people in high school ought to be able to

2 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
understand anything that is presented logically and clearly ; 
it is therefore better that the teacher should think of orderly 
organization of subject matter rather than devote time and 
attention to the study of students’ mental processes. 
These objections to the study of the mental processes 
of students have grown stronger in the minds of teachers 
and laymen because psychology has been slow to point 
out the applications of its principles to the work of the 
high school. Psychology has been a general and some- 
what abstract description of mental life. For example, 
since the time of Aristotle psychologists have taught the 
laws of memory, but until recently no one has thought it 
important to study in detail the most economical methods 
of memorizing, and no one has made a careful analysis of 
the ways in which the general laws of memory manifest 
themselves in the special fields of historical and mathe-. 
matical study. Again, psychology has had much to say 
about the perception of space, but little has been worked 
out regarding the mental processes involved in the study 
of geometry, which is based on space perception, and little 
has been written on the relation of courses in drawing 
to space perception. Finally, psychology has taught that 
mental development is a gradual process exhibiting stages 
which differ in the quantity and probably in the quality 
of the intellectual processes exhibited, but few writers 
have attempted to tell us how the fourteen-year-old boy 
differs in his train of ideas from the boy just ready to 
graduate from the high school at eighteen years of age. 
In short, we have been without a thoroughgoing applica- 
tion of even the most generally accepted principles of 
psychology. 
After assuming, in behalf of the science of psychology, 
a due share of responsibility for this neglect of applica- 
tions, it is just to call attention to the fact that, in a very 
proper sense of the word, psychology cannot be charged
-P-A-G-E-13
INTRODUCTION 3 
with the task of applying its principles. Applications vary 
with different situations and must be worked out by many 
minds. The same is true in the domain of physical science. 
Many and diverse are the situations which arise in industry 
and art. Just as the science of physics remains seemingly ab- 
stract and general until the manifold applications of mechan- 
ical laws are worked out by a thousand practical inventors, 
so the science of psychology can never, as a science, dem- 
onstrate its usefulness until many workers apply its general 
laws to concrete cases. 
SoctaL Necessity oF StupyING STUDENTS 
Fortunately for educational psychology there are social 
forces at work which are making necessary a careful study 
of the mental processes of high-school students. However 
reluctant teachers and supervisors may be to turn away 
from subject matter, however large their confidence in 
classroom experience, the urgent problems of secondary 
education are calling for new insights and new wisdom; 
and psychological methods of studying these problems are 
being called into service on every hand more rapidly than 
these methods can be refined by careful, technical study. 
We find ourselves, accordingly, in the curious situation of 
listening to vehement objections to the study of psychology, 
while at the same time we observe social forces compelling 
a movement in the direction of the study of educational 
problems by psychological methods. 
Thus the sudden enrichment of the course of study has 
so disturbed the quiet satisfaction with which the older 
subjects, such as foreign languages and mathematics, con- 
sumed the time of students that no department feels any 
security about its place on the program. Latin, seeing the 
sudden end of Greek, its sometime companion in aristocratic 
supremacy, has cultivated the fluent use of a formidable

4 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
psychological vocabulary, and one hears the teacher of this 
ancient and respected tongue contending that Latin culti- 
vates the constructive ae gives the student train- 
ing in comparison and generaliz: tion, and develops the 
power of expression.! In like spirit the teacher of algebra 
confesses that his subject has in the past been somewhat 
abstract, but he promises to eliminate the most objection- 
able and formal parts of the subject and to amplify those 
parts which will aid the student in concise, accurate, and 
summary treatment of the quantitative aspects of nature.” 
The newer subjects are exultant in a formula which they 
believe that the psychologist has ‘supplied them, and fall 
upon the older members of the course of study with the 
statement that the dogma of formal discipline is to be re- 
placed by the doctrine of specific training.* Since there is 
no more formal discipline, the argument runs, there ought 
to be infinite variety in the course of study. 
The psychologist, who has traditionally been a person of 
the most abstract temper, observes with interest that he has 
become a party to the struggle for place in the high-school 
program. He may be permitted to wonder why the destruc- 
tive psychologists who attack formal discipline are quoted 
so freely by the newer subjects, and the constructive psy- 
chologist who has developed a positive doctrine of general 
habits‘ has to wait for the gradual spread of interest in 
psychology before he can be heard. It seems at times that 
education is moving in the direction of a study of applica- 
tions of psychology, but moving somewhat obliquely.

INTRODUCTION 5 
Urgent DEMANDS FoR EFFICIENCY AND Economy 
Again, social forces are pushing in the direction of psy- 
chological studies because in these days there is a wide- 
spread interest in efficiency and economy. One may scoff 
at this interest and dub it mercenary and groveling if he 
likes, but the time has passed when the public will pay for 
a school which has no justification for its being other than 
that it fills up the leisure of its students. Indeed, systems 
of training are open to criticism, even though they are 
thought to be working along right lines, if their work is 
done clumsily and to less than the maximum effect. It is 
no longer accepted as a mere academic discussion when it 
is reported that the English instruction given in high schools 
and colleges is inefficient.1 English has been generously 
dealt with in the course of study in recent years. When it 
is found that students cannot write and do not read, the 
question arises very pointedly, What is the matter? One 
finds the English teachers organizing and discussing the 
natural tendency toward dramatization,? the contrast in 
effectiveness between oral and written expression, and the 
literary preferences of different stages of adolescent develop- 
ment. When the English teachers take up such matters as 
these, the psychologist rejoices to note that a wider currency 
is being given to a type of consideration which he developed 
at a time when teachers of English and science and mathe- 
matics were absorbed in their subjects and regarded the 
psychological jargon as of little value. Even the layman is 
beginning to interest himself in these detailed discussions. 
Surveys are organized to find out whether school moneys 
are well spent and whether the time of boys and girls is

properly conserved. The methods of these surveys turn 
out to be, in many cases, psychological. The psychologist 
is finding in the school surveys an opportunity to carry out 
on a large scale tests which a few years ago he proposed in 
vain as purely psychological studies. 
RECOGNITION OF INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES 
Another problem which has come to be an urgent social 
problem is that of individual differences. The time was 
when a boy or girl was assigned |a station in life in terms 
of the father’s achievements in the world. To-day a new 
order is being evolved. Society is finding that its tasks are 
most efficiently performed by those who are best suited 
through native and acquired interests to certain particular 
kinds of work. The whole school system beyond the first 
six years of the elementary school recognizes clearly the 
principle of differentiation, and is absorbed in studying 
individual variations so as to provide adequately for the 
different natures and interests of students. Here again the 
psychologist recognizes a familiar type of study. Centuries 
ago Descartes distinguished between different tempera- 
ments. He used the terms which the medieval physicians 
had employed, and called attention to the differences be- 
tween the phlegmatic, or slow, individual and the quick, 
sanguine type of mind. He pointed out that some are hot- 
tempered or choleric and others sad or melancholic. The 
present-day psychologist is not satisfied with this general 
classification, but the reference to Descartes shows that he 
follows the lead of the founders of his science in calling 
attention to the fundamental differences in personality 
exhibited by high-school students. 
In 1888 Sir Francis Galton! made a notable modern 
contribution to the study of individual differences. He

  INTRODUCTION 7 
found that certain persons recall in vivid detail anything 
they have seen. Such persons he called visualizers. They 
remember the colors of objects and recall fully and accu- 
rately the positions of things. On the other hand, there are 
many who have only faint, blurred visual images. The 
work of Galton has been quoted again and again by those 
who would justify this or that educational practice. More 
recently several students of psychology, notably Thorndike 
and Hall,? have developed the doctrine of individual differ- 
ences in an extreme form. The advocates of various inno- 
vations, such as vocational education and special courses for 
girls, have seized on these studies with the greatest avidity. 
GENERAL AND SPECIAL STUDIES OF PsycHOLOGY 
Such examples encourage the psychologist to believe that 
the time is ripe to essay the comprehensive task of applying 
his science to all high-school problems. This general appli- 
cation has been attempted from one point of view by that 
pioneer in educational psychology, G. Stanley Hall. Hall 
undertook to give a description of the mental characteristics 
of the adolescent period. So elaborate is his description 
that it frequently becomes highly speculative and fantastic, 
but the outcome is a keen awareness on the part of high- 
school teachers that adolescent mental processes are not 
like those of earlier childhood and not like those of adult 
life. This recognition of the special characteristics of the 
adolescent mind turns out, however, to be only of general 
value to the individual teacher in his daily task of training 
students. The teacher’s special instrument of instruction 
is the particular subject matter which engages both his

thought and that of the student. The general facts about 
the period of adolescence do not determine what should be 
done in these particular courses, Would it not be more 
productive to take up one after another the subjects of in- 
struction and inquire what are the mental reactions typical 
in each? General psychology and the special psychology 
of adolescence would thus be focused on the day’s task. 
To be sure, there will appear in the successive chapters of 
such a psychology of ie toachodtl ous the clearest evi- 
dence that there are general temperamental traits, general 
habits of visualization, general laws of memory, and all the 
rest, but these generalizations will not be the chief matters 
of investigation. It is the special mathematical idea gener- 
ated in grasping an algebraical formula which the teacher 
of mathematics must control. It is the special recognition 
of the Latin form which is important to the teacher of 
the classics. General principles will not satisfy these 
specific needs. 
The preceding paragraph may leave in the mind of the 
reader the impression that each teacher is to be urged to 
study only the psychology of his own specialty. It must be 
admitted that even so much knowledge of applied psychol- 
ogy as would be represented by a chapter on the psychology 
of a single subject would be a real addition to the equip- 
ment of most high-school teachers. But one should not con- 
fuse this plea for a little psychology with the final purpose 
of the psychologist. Applied pene will advance most 
rapidly if it is subdivided to conform to the teacher’s special 
needs and interests, but the science will not be complete 
until a synthetic comparison is made of the results of these 
special chapters. Such a comparison is necessary in order 
to show clearly the meaning of statements like the follow- 
ing: Algebra is abstract and theoretical; manual training 
is concrete and practical. The algebra teacher must ulti- 
mately know what is meant by concrete and practical; the  
-P-A-G-E-19
INTRODUCTION 9 
manual-training teacher must know what it means when 
we assert that some subjects in the curriculum are abstract. 
To a plea for the cultivation of special psychological studies 
in each field may therefore be added an equally urgent plea 
for a comprehensive study of the psychology of all fields. 
One of the gravest menaces to the unity of educational in- 
stitutions to-day is the lack of common interests on the part 
of special teachers. Their natural, common interest is, of 
course, the student. If the effect upon the student of a 
course in English is to make him more appreciative of emo- 
tional experiences, what effect will this have upon his in- 
terest in geometry ? The psychology of the special subjects 
will thus merge into the psychology of the student; but 
the investigation is introduced by a treatment of specific, 
practical problems and is brought gradually up to the more 
general considerations. 
TypicAL PROBLEMS FOR SPECIAL StuDY 
In order to show that specific problems are the natural 
starting points of the study, let us anticipate later discus- 
sions by referring to one or two urgent special questions. 
One hears the teacher of science, for example, advocating 
the use of drawings in the notebooks of students. If the 
question is raised whether all kinds of drawing contribute 
to clearness of scientific thought, one is likely to get an 
answer from the uncritical teacher which is too inclusive. 
As a matter of fact, only analytical drawing is of value in 
science work; general sketches are often worse than useless 
in cultivating scientific observation. This example gives us 
the opportunity to dwell on the moral that teachers of 
science should clear up their psychology of drawing. They 
have a vague idea about drawing and about the way in 
which it affects mental life, but they seldom subject this 
vague notion to adequate, scientific criticism.

10 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
The teacher of languages writes in a large, loose way 
that pronunciation of a foreign language is important be- 
cause it contributes to the student’s sensory and motor 
experience.1 The more sensory material the student gets, 
the more vivid and lasting his experiences; the more the 
motor organs are exercised, the more permanent the effect 
of impression. If these statements are true, they are im- 
portant for the teacher. If they are not true, or if they need 
to be qualified in any degree, the teacher of language will 
be helped by a substitution of exact, scientific statements 
for the indefinite beliefs with which he started. 
How shall definite, exact statements be substituted for 
present vague ideas on the psychology of high-school sub- 
jects? It would, needless to say, be a source of large satis- 
faction to the writer if he could answer this question by 
saying: Read the following chapters and you will be in the 
presence of an exact science. In the interests of candor, it 
must be said that the goal is not reached. This volume is 
an effort to open up as many questions as possible, to sum- 
marize definite knowledge where such exists, and to suggest 
to high-school teachers the methods which they may adopt 
in carrying on this type of study.   
METHODS OF COLLECTING PsycHOLOGICAL MATERIAL 
The writer has found it very productive for himself and 
for his students to take in hand some one of the books on 
the teaching of a specific high-acbool subject or some text- 
book designed for classroom use, and to read its pages with 
the idea of discovering the psychological principles which 
the author had in mind, often very vaguely. Conversely, 
it is interesting and profitable to assume the attitude of a 
teacher of mathematics or history and to read some general

INTRODUCTION 11 
book on psychology for the sake of extracting those psycho- 
logical principles which can be applied to the special sub- 
ject. Such readings, undertaken with a highly specialized 
purpose, raise many interesting and important questions 
for the student of high-school problems. 
Once a question is raised, the answer can be sought 
through systematic observation, including experimentation. 
Systematic observation has for the most part been lacking 
in school work. For example, teachers visit other schools 
than their own for the sake of observing. On arrival in the 
strange school, the visitor finds himself absorbed in the 
material equipment, in the textbook, in the appearance of 
the students, in the personality of the teacher, and in a host 
of other externals. The hour passes without any definite 
concentration of observation on any single problem. The 
case is often quite as bad when one tries to observe his own 
students while he tries, at the same time, to do his duty as 
a teacher. The effort to keep the class moving and the 
urgency of the sheer social situation in the classroom are so 
engrossing that the teacher finds the hour past and no psy- 
chological observations completed. In the midst of such 
distractions the teacher must learn two maxims of scientific 
method: first, select one definite point on which to make 
observations ; and second, make these observations deliber- 
ately for a sufficient period of time to reach some conclu- 
sions. Accessory devices are valuable, such as keeping 
records and setting up experimental conditions. Thus, in the 
matter of drawing in the science class, keep the drawings 
and compare them with the rest of the work of each indi- 
vidual. In the matter of pronunciation of a foreign language, 
have one class which emphasizes pronunciation and another 
which does not, keeping the other conditions, so far as possi- 
ble, alike. If teachers could be induced to begin systematic 
observations in their special lines and to report their find- 
ings, the science of educational psychology would flourish.
-P-A-G-E-22
12 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
Indeed, it is hopeless for the teacher of psychology to 
undertake single-handed to do much toward developing a 
science of applied psychology. He can raise questions and 
formulate suggestions, but the applications, as indicated 
above, must be worked out and refined by many workers. 
In the past, individual teachers have doubtless reached 
many definite and well-supported conclusions, but these 
have been, for the most part, lost because there was no 
effort to collect and record them. To-day the teaching pro- 
fession is working more and more as a unit, and the time 
is at hand when agencies will be developed for bringing 
together the scattered findings of many observers. It is the 
purpose of the following studies to contribute to this end. 
Even disagreement with the conclusions reached can be 
accepted as promoting the purposes of the book, provided 
these disagreements are supported by observations. 
Exact MEASUREMENT AND SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS ” 
There is one discussion upon which it is appropriate to 
touch at this time, in order to create in the minds of teachers 
a proper conception of scientific method. An acrimonious 
dispute has been carried on in some quarters between prac- 
tical school people and the so-called scientific experts re- 
garding the possibility of measuring school activities and 
evaluating results of teaching in a rigid, scientific way. The 
expert calls for exact comparisons with standards and for 
tables which show quantitatively how far these standards 
are reached. The individual student and the individual 
teacher seem to many to be left out of consideration in 
these strenuous efforts to attain exactness and a high degree 
of generality. Many a teacher is alienated, and refuses to 
become a party to scientific study of education because he 
does not sympathize with the expert’s demands for rigid, 
scientific exactness.     
 
-P-A-G-E-23
INTRODUCTION 13 
The writer of these pages is an advocate of exactness 
and of rigid, scientific formulation of results, but he is also 
an advocate of direct, analytical studies of individual cases. 
He believes it is possible to reconcile these two types of 
study so that the strict, scientific character of each shall 
be apparent. 
After all, what is sought in scientific studies of educa- 
tion is a thorough understanding of each situation which 
arises. Take the case of a boy who is about to leave school. 
The teacher may let the boy go without making any effort 
to study his case, or may try to find out about the boy’s 
home conditions, about his expectations of employment, 
about the boy’s success or failure in his studies, and the 
reason for failure if this is one of the causes of withdrawal. 
Such a study of a single boy may be most productive. The 
difficulty with such a study of a single case is that the 
teacher is not likely, without contact with other cases, to 
know how to attack the problem. For example, let us sup- 
pose that the boy says that his family needs the money he 
can earn. Perhaps this is merely an excuse that the boy 
offers himself and his friends, not the real cause of with- 
drawal. If the teacher has at hand a whole series of cases 
which have been analyzed on the side of their economic 
urgency, he will have standards of economic needs by 
which he can determine whether this boy really is forced 
to withdraw or is merely falling into this device of justify- 
ing his act. Furthermore, if the teacher can show by the 
study of many cases that there is a constant tendency in 
boys of a certain type and age to become interested in occu- 
pations, even when there is no economic stress, he will see 
in this particular boy the operation of a general principle. 
The teacher will come to realize that this one boy’s act is 
an indication that the whole school situation needs to be 
looked into. Perhaps what is needed is not a reform of the 
boy, but a reform of the course of study. This example
-P-A-G-E-24
a eee

| 
shows that the individual teacher needs to have his hori- 
zon extended by general studies in order that his particular 
observations may be understood in their true perspective. 
ARBITRARY STANDARDS AND SCIENTIFIC STANDARDS 
Take another type of aaceuiieb. The teacher of science 
in a high school has in mind certain standards which he 
regards as representing the legitimate requirements to im- 
pose upon his students. The students should be able, he 
thinks, to reason, to. apply their mathematics, and to look 
up information in the library. Several students in the class 
cannot do this, and he warns them or puts them out. The 
rest of the class struggles through the course and never 
elects any more science work. The teacher takes great 
pride in his high standard and strong handling of the class. 
Very often he has been wrong in his views about students; 
he has been arbitrary and wholly unscientific in his behavior. 
If he is a keen observer and of an adaptable temperament, 
he will gradually change his acl oks and will, with increas- 
ing experience, ultimately reach standard which will be 
a compromise between the arbitrary standard with which 
he started and the real needs of his students. This slow re- 
adjustment could have been greatly facilitated if the teacher 
had at the outset investigated his students by some of the 
tests which are being developed in every subject. A test is a 
means of informing an instructor what students of a certain 
degree of maturity can do. The kind of work which in the 
long run is best for the school is not determined by a consid- 
eration exclusively of the subject to be taught. The students 
in one class should be compared with students of other schools 
and of other degrees of maturity. The trouble with many 
a teacher, especially when he first begins to teach, is that he 
does not have a knowledge of students adequate to give him 
proper standards of judgment. Standards of judgment are 
 
-P-A-G-E-25
  INTRODUCTION 15 
matters of comparative experience, and they must be set 
up through observation and comparison of many cases. 
The demands for general standards sometimes discourage 
teachers, because they realize that the individual teacher 
often has no opportunity to make comparisons on a large 
scale. There are two considerations which may help to 
remove this natural discouragement. First, standards are 
being developed through coéperative activity and are be- 
coming each year more easily accessible. If teachers will 
codperate in working out these standards and will examine 
the work done along these lines, there will shortly be no 
lack of comparative material usable by all. Second, and 
more important, is the fact that the establishment of 
general standards is only one phase of scientific study. 
Standards are valuable only when they aid in producing 
discriminating analyses of individual cases. Here is a boy 
who is failing in algebra. General standards help to sug- 
gest various ways of determining the facts in this case, 
and the combined experience of algebra teachers would, if 
known, undoubtedly suggest possible explanations of the 
individual’s difficulties. But after all is done and said, this 
individual case must be analyzed as an individual case. 
In its totality it is not like any other in the world. That 
teacher is truly scientific who sits down with all the ex- 
perience and suggestions he can gather and focuses these 
on this individual case. What this particular boy needs 
is perhaps guidance in how to study, or he may need to be 
given an outlook into his own future possibilities, or he 
may need to go back and review something essential which 
he missed, or he may need more physical exercise. What- 
ever he needs, he is a case to be diagnosed by a trained 
analyst. Science in its applications is here seen to assume 
the form of analysis. 
Individual teachers are scientific when they acquire the 
ability to analyze individual cases. They will usually be
-P-A-G-E-26
16 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
most successful in analyzing individual cases if they work 
in the light of general experiences. The teaching profes- 
sion becomes scientific when it creates a body of general 
standards and principles of analysis which will help the 
individual teacher in making individual diagnoses. The 
science of education is general, comprehensive, inclusive ; 
the scientific work of the trained teacher who applies scien- 
tific principles must be both comprehensive and penetrat- ' : | ing, both general and analytic. Between the two demands 
there is no opposition. The keen analysis of the individual 
teacher will aid the comprehensive science; the compre- 
hensive study will give the individual teacher the instru- 
ments of analysis. There are many cases in which the 
general science and the experience of the individual teacher 
will not cover with equal completeness some urgent, con- 
erete school problem. We shall then have to get on by the 
best guessing of which we are capable. If, however, we 
have the true scientific spirit, guessing will be followed 
by a careful criticism of the outcome. Even here, where 
we are forced to act without the guidance of science, we 
can turn the case to the advantage of science by following 
up our results. : 
These comments will serve to illustrate what is meant by 
the statement made some paragraphs back that all careful, 
systematic studies of school problems are scientific. There 
need be no lack of coéperation between the scientist and 
the practical teacher. There need be no aloofness on the 
part of teachers. Our science of applied psychology is in 
the making — any real epenbsnse yi contribute to its 
development. In what degree this is true in the domain 
of high-school teaching the following chapters will aim to 
demonstrate.
-P-A-G-E-27
CHAPTER II 
PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS IN MATHEMATICS 
Mathematics is the best subject with which to open our 
studies. In the first place, the practical difficulties which 
arise in teaching mathematics bring the courses in this sub- 
ject constantly to the attention of all who are interested in 
the development of the high school. In the second place, 
psychology is better equipped to discuss mathematics than 
it is to deal with any other school subject, because the psy- 
chology of space perception which throws light on geom- 
etry, and the psychology of abstraction which throws light 
on algebra, are among the most complete and satisfactory 
chapters in psychology. 
In dealing with mathematics it will be possible to illus- 
trate a number of general methods and typical conclusions. 
The reader of these early chapters should be prepared, 
therefore, to carry forward many of the discussions to later 
subjects, keeping in mind the comment made in the intro- 
ductory chapter that the psychology of high-school subjects 
is a general science, not merely a series of isolated chapters 
on particular subjects. 
THE PsycHoLoGy oF FAILURES 
Mathematics must be recognized as one of: the most 
difficult subjects in the high-school course. The follow- 
ing table gives, in a vivid way, evidence in support of this 
statement. It shows the failures and withdrawals in eleven 
suburban high schools surrounding Chicago and reveals a 
condition which is doubtless typical.

PROBLEMS IN MATHEMATICS 19 
The figures given for withdrawals include all who left the 
course before the examination. Some withdrew for the reason 
that they were failing, but these were not separated from those 
who withdrew for reasons unrelated to their scholarship. The 
significance of withdrawals, as compared with failures, comes 
out in comparison of different classes. Thus compare English I 
with Latin I. In many cases the students in English remain in 
the course and fail rather than withdraw. This is doubtless due 
in part to the fact that English is required of all students. In 
Latin, on the other hand, students withdraw after they have tried 
the course for a short time. The percentage of withdrawals is 
accordingly greater than the percentage of failures. There is a 
very surprising percentage of withdrawals in manual training. 
The table given above also shows that the mental proc- 
esses which the mathematics teacher aims to call out are 
less likely to be called out successfully in the average 
student than are most of the mental processes with which 
the high school deals. 
CHANGES IN MATHEMATICAL TEXTBOOKS AND COURSES 
Following this clue of the difficulty of mathematics, we 
find striking evidences on all sides that the mathematicians 
have been trying to make their subject easier. The algebra 
textbook of to-day is a less difficult text than was the book 
of twenty years ago. In geometry the same process of sim- 
plification has been going on. Furthermore, not only have 
the individual courses been reduced to a minimum, but the 
requirement of mathematics for graduation and for admis- 
sion to college has been steadily relaxed. All these facts 
bear eloquent testimony to the difficulty of the mathemati- 
cal modes of thought for the average student. 
While mathematics has thus been gradually reduced, 
other questions have naturally arisen. The place of algebra 
in the first year has been called in question. The experi- 
ment has been tried of putting algebra into the second year,
-P-A-G-E-30
—— 
| 
20 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
| 
with distinctly better results. It is to be noted that in this 
experiment the students are somewhat more highly selected 
because of the withdrawals of the first year, and they have 
the advantage of other lines of work which have prepared 
them more fully; but these facts only make it clearer that 
algebra in the first year is at least open to question. 
| 
HISTORICAL GROUNDS FOR THE Position OF GEOMETRY 
Historical considerations strengthen the suspicion that 
our high-school mathematics is Eh well arranged. Nothing 
is more evident than that algebra is less natural to the 
occidental mind than geometry. The Greeks had a vast 
knowledge of geometry and very little knowledge of alge- 
bra. The knowledge which the Greeks had of geometry was 
undoubtedly related to their interest in form and figure. 
They were a nation of sculptors, and their wise men formu- 
lated the science of angles and areas to the point where it 
could take on that rigid logical formulation which Euclid 
gave to Greek geometry. While all this interest was being 
manifested in form and space, nothing of the modern type 
of algebra was known. Indeed, that the simpler science of 
numbers was in a most primitive stage, is shown by the 
clumsy number system evolved by the Greeks and Romans. 
Before we turn to the history of the introduction of alge- 
bra into Europe, let us see how it came about that geom- 
etry gained the place which it holds as a more advanced 
subject than algebra. One would expect geometry to come 
early in the school course, in view of the fact that it matured 
much earlier than algebra. The fact is that its very per- 
fection served to take geometry into the highest schools. 
In the university of Alexandria the results of Greek studies 
of space were put into logical form by Euclid. This logi- 
cal form was also borrowed from Greece, where Aristotle 
had evolved that perfect system of syllogistic logic which
-P-A-G-E-31
  PROBLEMS IN MATHEMATICS 21 
dominated the whole period of medieval thought. A com- 
plete geometry expressed in a perfectly logical form became 
one of the chief subjects of the highest courses of study. 
Studies of space were no longer of the primitive type that 
had grown up among the early Greeks. Teachers in the 
lower schools have never realized that the union of logic 
and space studies deprived them of one of their most natu- 
ral subjects of instruction, namely, form-study. The logical 
statement of the principles of geometry has blinded modern 
as well as medieval teachers to the true worth of this subject 
for younger pupils. 
ALGEBRA HISTORICALLY OF SECONDARY IMPORTANCE 
Algebra, on the other hand, was a late comer. This 
science, like modern arithmetic, came into Europe with the 
Moors. A little arithmetic had been taught in the lower 
schools of Rome and medieval Europe to the shopkeepers, 
who needed it for their accounts, and to the priests, who 
needed it to compute their calendars. It was not until 
Europe learned the Arabic numerals that a real science of 
arithmetic became possible. With the new arithmetic came 
also a close relative, namely, algebra. Algebra, as a late 
comer and as a relative of arithmetic, took second place in 
the universities and high schools as compared with geom- 
etry; and second place meant, curiously enough, an earlier 
place in the course of study, no one having insight enough 
to raise the psychological question of the true intellectual 
sequence of the two subjects. 
This historical sketch shows how utterly lacking in 
rational, psychological arrangement has been the school 
course in mathematics. It is at least thinkable that algebra 
ought to follow geometry. Indeed, one reads in the books 
on the teaching of mathematics discussions which suggest 
that even the mathematicians have at times had guilty
-P-A-G-E-32
  22 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
consciences about the matter.! To the psychologist who 
has no interest in following the traditional order of the 
course of study it seems important to raise a series of 
psychological questions. Why did the Greeks develop 
geometry early? Why did the logical form which geom- 
etry took on fail to develop in later generations the vivid 
interest in space and the keen perception of space exhibited 
by the early Greeks ? What is there in algebra and geom- 
etry which justifies the classification of the two under the 
single term “mathematics”? Is the relation between arith- 
metic and algebra recognized by the ordinary high-school 
student ? If teachers find that arithmetic does not easily 
carry over into algebra, how was it that arithmetic and 
algebra were related in their early history when they were 
not associated with geometry ? Are algebra and geometry 
related in the thought of students? The mere asking of 
these questions shows how rich is the opportunity for psy- 
chological analysis of high-school courses in mathematics. 
INTERRELATION OF ALGEBRA AND GEOMETRY 
Perhaps the most significant psychological questions are 
those which arise out of the fact that the mathematicians 
recognize all of the different branches of these sciences as 
interrelated, while students do not. Descartes showed that 
algebra and geometry are parts of a single system of thought. 
What is it that is common to the two subjects? The 
schools and historical development have kept them apart, 
and now, in the effort to follow the suggestions of the 
mathematicians, there is a new and vigorous movement to 
bring them together. In Europe, especially in England,

of advocates of combination.
-P-A-G-E-33
  PROBLEMS IN MATHEMATICS 23 
and at several centers in America, combinations of one sort 
or another have been attempted. If these combinations are 
to be ultimately successful, they must be based on some 
clear and explicit principle. This principle must be a 
psychological principle, for the combination of the two 
subjects is intended to produce some sort of intellectual 
advantage to the student. What is this advantage ? 
THE PROBLEM OF APPLICATION 
Another interesting psychological question arises when 
we consider the problem of applying mathematics to other 
spheres of thought and action. Experience shows in the 
most discouraging way that a student may know his algebra 
and geometry and not know how to apply mathematics to 
physics or to certain practical shop problems. Evidently 
one is not performing the same mental process when he 
masters a mathematical formula and when he uses it. This 
suggests the study of the psychology of applications. 
In seeking answers to the psychological problems which 
have been stated in the last few pages, we shall begin by 
summarizing the conclusions which general psychology 
has reached in its studies of space perception. We shall 
thus have the advantage, as pointed out above, of being 
in a field where psychology can speak with a good deal 
of definiteness.

  CHAPTER III 
THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SPACE 
Space A CoMPLEX ForRM OF EXPERIENCE 
Most people who have not studied the character of their 
space experiences assume that all one needs to do in order 
to see distance or form is to open his eyes and look. A 
very little consideration will, however, convince even the 
superficial observer that this is not true. The ordinary 
man sees maple trees and elm trees and apple trees, and 
does not notice that each of these kinds of trees has a 
characteristically different form. We all of us look at the 
houses in which we live, but the chances are infinitely 
large that we do not notice many of the facts of form 
which come out immediately if we pause for a moment 
and look with careful discrimination. As for distance, 
we all know that the judgment of the ordinary person 
is very crude. Every novice at baseball knows that he 
has very little power of recognizing distances; and the 
false estimations which result when one goes from the moist 
air of the seashore to the dry, clear air of the mountains 
have been commented on again and again. Furthermore, 
the sizes of things are constantly misjudged. The house 
which seems so huge to the little child shrinks into very 
modest dimensions in the consciousness of the man. The 
colossal statue disappoints the tourist when he first sees it 
from a distance. Men and horses seen from a high build- 
ing fascinate one with their curious littleness. 
Perhaps the most striking way of reénforcing these 
commonplace examples of the fact that space is not seen 
24  
-P-A-G-E-35
  THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SPACE 25 
by merely opening the eyes is to report a laboratory experi- 
ment, which shows how the recognition of a simple form 
develops through a few repeated observations. 
EXPERIMENTAL Stupy oF SPACE PERCEPTION! 
When a pattern is ten times in succession laid before an 
observer for ten-second intervals and his successive efforts 
to reproduce the pattern are compared, there is often very 
striking evidence of the development which has taken place 
during the ten drawings, but it is extremely difficult to 
prepare a table or curve which will adequately demonstrate 
these facts of development. In order to make clear the 
character of the results and at the same time illustrate 
some of the most significant characteristics of the drawing, 
two series of drawings are reproduced in Fig. 1. These re- 
productions are one sixteenth the size of the actual draw- 
ings. The figure shows two full series from observers 
F and W. Above the two series of drawings from these 
observers is shown the pattern which they were trying to 
reproduce. 
Considering series A, which is from subject F, certain 
facts regarding the subject’s perceptual development are 
very evident. The first drawing is correct in general out- 
line, but very vague in its details. The subject has here a 
percept comparable to that which most persons have of an 
object which has been observed superficially but not exam- 
ined in detail. The face of a comparative stranger, for ex- 
ample, or the forms of a plant or wall-paper pattern are first 
recognized in gross general outline. Drawing II shows 
progress, in that the details now begin to be correctly repro- 
duced. The first part of the figure has evidently received

not merely a vague general inspection, but has been 
examined in detail. The slow rate at which the details of 
a percept are recognized is here strikingly illustrated, in the

fact that an adult who is perfectly familiar with lines of 
this character does not succeed in ten seconds in clearing 
up more than five lines. Furthermore, the fourth and fifth 
lines are sufficiently different from the pattern to be recog- 
nized as rough approximations rather than fully recognized  
-P-A-G-E-37
  THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SPACE 27 
details. The general form of the figure is maintained while 
the details of the first part are being worked out. In draw- 
ing III is illustrated a fact which comes out time and time 
again with almost every subject. There appears in the 
course of perceptual development a certain point where 
readjustment of the recognition of the parts is so actively 
under way that if the subject is interrupted before the re- 
adjustment is complete, the reproduction shows the great- 
est confusion. Thus, in drawing III what had been gained 
in drawing II seems to be wholly lost. Moreover, the gen- 
eral form of the figure which was approximated in the first 
drawing is here much less correctly reproduced than in 
either of the preceding figures. Such a poor reproduction 
as that in drawing III must be recognized as very striking 
evidence of the complexity of the perceptual process. The 
explanation of the period of confusion can be made out 
very clearly in this case by an examination of drawing IV 
and reference to the subject’s introspections. The intro- 
spective record is as follows: “There is a succession of 
straight and curved lines, but their order is very confused 
in my mind. I think there should be more curves, especially 
at the end.” The essential point is in this reference to the 
end. From drawing IV it is evident that the subject is try- 
ing to straighten out the confusion at the right end. The 
right end of the figure was vague in drawings I and II. In 
II the first part of the figure was mastered. In turning to 
the right end the confusion arises, as shown in drawing III. 
The subject has not had time in drawing III to master the 
right end. This is finally accomplished in drawing IV, but 
the attention is withdrawn from the general form of the 
figure and from the first part of the drawing in the effort 
to work out the last part. Drawing III is a very striking ex- 
ample of the difficulty of any single test of mental ability. 
Without drawings I, II, and IV a very false notion would 
be gained of the subject’s mental condition from II.  
-P-A-G-E-38
28 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
Drawing IV shows, as has been pointed out, the mastery 
of the end of the drawing. It also shows that the subject 
has mastered a general characteristic of the figure, which 
consists in the alternation of curved and straight lines. 
The introspective records show that this principle has been 
explicitly recognized. That the perceptual record of the 
first part of the figure is wholly incorrect shows what is 
certainly a general tendency in adult mental processes, 
namely, the tendency to generalize perceptual experiences 
under some abstract statement and to neglect the perceptual 
details out of which the abstract statement grew. The sub- 
ject of these tests must have seen the succession of straight 
lines and curves, but was evidently more attracted by the 
abstract relational fact of succession than by the concrete 
forms of the parts of the figure. The concrete relations 
were recognized only at the end of the figure toward which 
perceptual attention had been definitely attracted. 
Drawing V shows the. mastery of the figure. Its relation 
to the earlier processes of distribution of attention, of mas- 
tery of parts, of confusion and recognition of the general 
principle of alternation is sufficiently obvious from what 
has been said. This drawing could not be understood at 
all if it had been preceded merely by drawing IV or by II 
and IV. The mastery of the first part of the drawing, as 
shown in drawing II, is an essential part of the preparation 
for drawing V. Though the elements mastered in drawing 
II have been for a time neglected in drawing III and IV, they 
can be more easily recovered than at first. In drawing II 
there is evidence that if the subject attended to the first 
part of the figure, he could not at the same time include 
in a single process of recognition the last part of the figure. 
Putting the matter in quantitative terms, we may say that 
the scope of perceptual consciousness, as evidenced in draw- 
ing IT, is three clear lines and two vague lines. In drawing 
V the first five lines are recovered with sufficient ease so 
 
-P-A-G-E-39
  THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SPACE 29 
that the scope of perceptual consciousness extends over all 
seven lines. The greater inclusiveness of perceptual con- 
sciousness in drawing V gives evidence of a facilitation in 
some degree of the perception of the first five lines; and 
since this facilitation did not occur during the period occu- 
pied in drawings III and IV, it must have been carried over 
from the period of drawing II. 
The remaining drawings of this series show certain de- 
tails which are typical. Thus the angle of line three dete- 
riorates instead of improves through the later drawings of 
the series. This may be connected with the fact that the 
greatest error in all the later drawings is to be found in 
the angle of line four. There is very noticeable variation 
in the position of line four. In drawing VIII it is better than 
in drawing VII, but in IX it is again worse than in 
drawing VIII. In drawing X there is a very decided 
improvement in the position of line four. There is, on the 
other hand, in drawing X, not merely the deterioration 
of line three noted above, but also a very marked lapse 
in the length of line six. Other similar facts will be 
obvious from the drawings. 
The various lapses and slight improvements in the last 
five drawings show very clearly why there is so little im- 
provement in our ordinary perception of complex figures. 
Attention is from moment to moment fastened upon this 
or that detail of the figure and there is a corresponding 
withdrawal of attention from some other part. The com- 
plete mastery of all the details is therefore a long process. 
In most ordinary experiences the interval between obser- 
vations is so long that the lapses more than make up for 
the periods of improvement, and so we have merely crude 
approximations to complete and correct percepts. 
Another general fact shown by the series as a whole is 
that the size of the figures is throughout too large. Indeed, 
there was a very general tendency, on the part of all the
-P-A-G-E-40
380 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
subjects to make mistakes in the size of the drawings. The 
significant fact in this immediate connection is that the sub- 
ject was in no case conscious of the error in size. That is 
evidently a matter upon which attention must be especially 
directed. While attention is on the various lines and their 
positions, there is little attention for size. 
SpAcE PERCEPTION A COMPLEX 
The foregoing discussion makes it clear that the recog- 
nition of form and distance develops in the course of expe- 
rience. We now turn to the demonstration of a second 
general fact with regard to space perception. The recog- 
nition of distance and form depends upon the bringing 
together or fusion in consciousness of many sensory ele- 
ments. Let the reader try the simple experiment of cover- 
ing and uncovering one eye while observing carefully the 
distafice in depth between the objects before him. He will 
note how his recognition of distance is affected by the pres- 
ence of sensations from both eyes in the one case, and by 
the withdrawal of part of his usual sensations in the other 
case. When he sees with only one eye, the world seems to 
flatten out into a single plane ; when both eyes are open, the 
objects stand out in clear relief, showing the importance of 
the two sets of sensations derived from the two eyes for 
a clear recognition of depth. 
FuRTHER EXAMPLES OF COMPLEX PERCEPTIONS 
or SPACE 
Other examples could be cited without end to prove the 
statement regarding the complexity of the sensory processes 
on which we depend for our recognition of form. One of 
these examples which is easy to present on the printed page 
may be added, in order to reénforce the conclusion reached
-P-A-G-E-41
  THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SPACE 31 
by comparing one-eyed vision with two-eyed vision. First 
look at two equal horizontal lines such as the following, 
and note how easy it is to recognize their equality. 
  
Fie. 2 
Then add oblique lines at the ends of the horizontals, and 
note how the added lines have not merely contributed more 
experience ; they have also changed the apparent length of 
the horizontals, showing that so simple a mental process as 
the recognizing of the length of lines can be complicated 
by added sensations which come from contiguous lines. 
rr 
oe Fie. 3 
In general, all lines and forms are seen in their settings, 
and are influenced by these settings. Or putting the prin- 
ciple in the terms in which it was originally stated, every 
space percept is a complex made up of many elements. 
RELATION OF PERCEPTION TO SENSATION 
From the foregoing statement, that space percepts are 
sensation complexes, we turn to a more difficult and abstract 
matter. Space may be defined negatively by saying that it is 
not a kind of sensation. Thus space is not color. One can 
lay before his eyes variously colored squares which are alike 
in their distance from the eye and alike in their contours,
-P-A-G-E-42
  82 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
but different in their colors. The spatial characteristics 
of these squares — that is, their forms and distances — are 
alike, but their colors are different. In like fashion it can 
be shown that space is not a touch sensation. I can reach 
out with my hand and touch these squares. If I keep my 
eyes shut as I reach, the distances and forms which a moment 
ago were perceived through the eyes will be perceived 
through the sense of touch without color. The distance 
will be recognized as the same as the distance seen, and the 
form as the same as that which was recognized with the 
eyes, but the sensory elements will be those of touch rather 
than of vision. Furthermore, distance and form are not 
only not identical with color sensations, they are quite as 
emphatically not identical with pressure impressions, with 
smoothness and hardness, or with coldness and muscular 
strain. We find thus that space is a type of experience into 
which vision or touch or other sensory qualities may enter, 
but space is not one of these sensory qualities. 
At times psychology has been disposed to find in sensa- 
tions of movement the explanation of space perception. 
The sensations from joints and muscles have been looked 
upon as the important factors in building up notions of 
space. This emphasis of sensations of movement does not 
contradict the statement that space is not identical with 
these sensations. If movements help to build up space 
ideas, it still remains true that the space scheme is com- 
prehensive enough to include also sensations from touch, 
vision, hearing, and other senses. 
The foregoing statement can be reénforced by calling 
attention to the fact that some sensory quality must always 
be present when we perceive form or distance. These spatial 
characteristics of things are no substitutes for sensory qual- 
ities. Thus, let one try to think of empty space: it will be 
noted that attention tends to fasten upon the wall around 
the empty space. Or if one tries to think of the middle of
-P-A-G-E-43
THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SPACE 383 
a vacuum, there will be a vague gray visual content filling 
the space. All these positive factors can be changed in 
quality, and yet the space may remain the same. Again try 
to think of infinite space: one moves on till he reaches in 
imagination a distant cloud, and after pausing a moment he 
moves on again through the vaguely seen gray distance. 
The man born blind, who has never seen clouds, represents 
infinite space in his imagination as the experience of swim- 
ming on and on without stopping. A1l these examples show 
that space is not identical with sensation ; yet, on the other 
hand, it is never experienced except when sensations are 
present to fill it or surround it. 
Space A RELATIONAL ForM oF CONSCIOUSNESS 
The statement for which we are now prepared is that 
space is a species of relational consciousness; it is a mode 
of arranging sensations. Thus, when one notes the distance 
between two points he has a conscious experience of transi- 
tion from one point to the other. During this transition he 
may see a white or black surface, or he may feel his arm 
moving, or he may recognize that his finger is passing over 
a rough or smooth surface. The sensations of color or touch 
which fill one’s consciousness are stepping stones for one’s 
spatial consciousness. The space perception itself is the 
stride from one sensory element to the next. Space is a 
relational fact, not a new sensation. As a relational form 
of consciousness space has certain characteristics which are 
like those exhibited in the higher forms of experience. 
Consciousness of transition is a general term which may 
apply to a great many different kinds of experiencé. Thus, 
I think not only of transition from near to far; I think of 
transition from a sad feeling to one of rejoicing. Wherever 
my experiences show gradations and I can note the tran- 
sition from one gradation to the other, I have a form of
-P-A-G-E-44
ee ee en ee ee ee 
84 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
consciousness which is similar to space in the fact that 
it is relational. 
Space is the most fundamental, direct, and familiar form 
of relational consciousness. The only other relational con- 
sciousness which is anything like as familiar as space is 
time. We shall not complicate the present discussion by 
attempting to describe the nature of time-consciousness. It 
is enough for our present purpose to note that space and 
time are the two universal forms in which all sensory facts 
appear in experience. 
Some reader may be wondering why the discussion of 
space is carried on in terms of consciousness. Why not 
talk about space as the receptacle in which all the things 
in the world are contained? Why not treat space as an 
external reality of a superior order embracing all the objects 
in the world? The answer to these questions is that the 
consideration of space as an external receptacle leaves us 
absolutely in the dark as to how it is known by human 
beings. We have a sense which explains our experiences 
of light and color. We have another sense for sounds, and 
another for touch qualities, and so on, through the whole 
list of qualitative experiences, but we have no sense through 
which we can get knowledge of a receptacle in which objects 
are contained. Empty space has no positive characteristics 
which it can impress on the mind. One could admit the 
existence of an external receptacle in which things are 
contained, and he would still have before him the prob- 
lem. How is this receptacle known? How does it get 
into the mind? 
In attempting to answer the question how space gets 
into the mind, psychology has been led to the statements 
made in earlier paragraphs. Space is recognized through 
the building up of a series of relations in consciousness. 
We pass from one object to another, the intervening sen- 
sations get themselves organized into a system or series of
-P-A-G-E-45
THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SPACE 35 
related experiences, and then we speak of space as the rela- 
tional aspect of the whole. We can talk about space as 
though it were empty. As a matter of real experience 
space is recognized as the transition from one object to 
another. It is the form or order in which objects are 
arranged. Empty space is not a really recognized fact; it 
is what remains if we think of all sensations as dropped 
out of our real percepts., 
THE GENESIS OF SPACE IDEAS 
These statements will become clearer if we study briefly 
the development of the child’s recognition of space. If one 
touches an infant of six months of age on the back of the 
head, the infant will get a sensation. He will respond by 
trying to put his hand on the stimulated spot, but he does 
not know where the sensation is, and shows that he does not 
know by his irregular and ill-directed movements. The 
infant has no spatial scheme in which he relates this sensa- 
tion to other sensations. As his experience matures he 
learns that this particular sensation has a definite relation 
to many other sensations from other points on his body. 
He learns that each sensation calls for a particular move- 
ment of his hand, and he thus learns where the back of the 
head is. He has learned to recognize the relation of sensa- 
tions from the back of his head to the rest of his world. 
Another example of learning to locate objects can be 
drawn from the experience of the tennis player. He gets a 
series of visual impressions as the ball comes toward him. 
These he meets with a complex reaction of his arm and 
hand or of his whole body. When he strikes the ball, he 
has successfully worked out a most complex adjustment of 
all the factors of vision and touch, using these to guide his 
motor organs. If he does not meet the ball, he exhibits the 
difficulty of relating the various factors of experience to
-P-A-G-E-46
86 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
each other, and the difficulty of moving his hands properly 
when experience is imperfectly organized. 
The foregoing examples show the importance of bodily 
movements in the development of space percepts. The 
infant learns the parts of his body by moving his hand to 
them; the tennis player learns to locate ball and hand by 
trying to move properly. So significant is movement for 
space recognition that some psychologists, as mentioned 
above, have held the view that space is a series of move- 
ment sensations coming from the joints and muscles. It is 
not necessary to enter into further critical discussion of this 
doctrine here; enough to remark once more that the im- 
portance of movement sensations can be fully recognized, 
and there yet remains the problem of explaining how all 
other sensations — colors, touch qualities, sounds, and the 
rest — come to be included in a single space scheme. Space, 
whatever the value of muscle sensations, is always some- 
thing more than these sensations — it is a general form of 
consciousness in which muscle sensations, visual sensations, 
and all other sensations are arranged. 
Space AND MovEMENT 
Indeed, we may go a step farther than do the muscle- 
sensation psychologists, in emphasizing the importance of 
moyement for the development of space perception. Move- 
ment is more than a mere source of sensations; it is a 
constant check on all our efforts to arrange our sensa- 
tions in the space form. If one sees a book on the table 
and, estimating its distance, reaches for it, he will, by the 
act of reaching, instantly prove his visual recognition of 
distance to be right or wrong. We are thus constantly im- 
proving our visual evaluation of the space relations within 
which we move. Things within our reach get properly 
related to each other and to our bodies, because if they did
-P-A-G-E-47
THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SPACE 37 
not we should fail in our practical adjustments. The world 
immediately under our hands gets organized in this prac- 
tical way with a high degree of completeness. This appears 
in the fact that we recognize the spatial relations of the 
things near at hand more fully than we recognize the spatial 
relations of things remote. 
Furthermore, space, as we know it through the practical 
organization of responses to sensations, reflects all the 
mechanical laws of weight and movement, because as we 
learn to relate our experiences in space we are constantly 
   
Fie. 4 
under the guidance of mechanical laws. For example, let 
the observer decide which of the three figures given above 
(Fig. 4) he prefers. He will inevitably choose the third, 
because the two black spots do not balance mechanically 
in the first two figures. The recognition of the lack of 
balance is in one sense not a matter of space perception; 
in another and important sense it is quite impossible for 
one to see the spatial relation between the two black spots 
without evaluating this relation in terms both of spatial 
distance and mechanical balance. 
Space perception is thus seen to include the results of 
many of our practical adjustments to objects about us.
-P-A-G-E-48
  38 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
Conversely, when we have no practical motives for detailed 
adjustments to objects and sensations, we are likely to be 
deficient in space perception. Thus, as mentioned above, 
the ordinary man sees people when looked at from a high 
building as small. Most of us have never had occasion to 
perfect our space perception of objects far below us. 
Another significant fact is that certain of our spatial 
percepts remain imperfect because the kind of practical 
adjustments into which these percepts enter do not require 
that we pay close attention to spatial details. Thus I see 
the face of my friend and recognize only so much of the 
spatial details of his features as I need to keep him distinct 
from other people. I do not explore his features as I should 
have to if I wanted to draw his face. My experience has 
developed only so far as my practical efforts have required. 
The example becomes still more striking if we consider 
the lack of space perception which one exhibits in the 
presence of persons whom he passes on the street and neg- 
lects because their faces are not familiar. One scarcely 
sees the details of these faces at all. 
From such examples as these we see that the degree of 
spatial analysis depends directly upon the kind of use 
which one is going to make of his sensations. The artist 
makes one kind of analysis of a mass of sensations, the 
familiar friend makes another, the stranger a third. 
UNIVERSAL CHARACTERISTICS OF SPACE PERCEPTS 
Whatever the individual differences in our perceptions of 
space relations, there are certain respects in which we all 
agree. Thus all human beings look at the world from an 
upright position. As a result we all recognize a vertical 
line as having unique value as a line of reference. What- 
ever departs from the vertical is recognized with vividness. 
On the other hand, a few degrees of deviation from an
-P-A-G-E-49
  
THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SPACE 39 
angle of forty-five degrees or from an angle of sixty de- 
grees are recognized very imperfectly. The vertical line is 
a fact of major importance in the experience of all human 
beings. In like fashion the experiences described by the 
words “up” and “down” have a distinct and common 
value for all human beings. The same is true of the words 
“backward” and “ forward.” 
Jennings has given a striking illustration of the fact that 
one human being is more like another human being in mat- 
ters of space experience than like some of the lower animals. 
Take, for example, the starfish. For this animal there is no 
forward and backward. His radial structure makes every 
direction a forward direction. If one wishes to put the star- 
fish in a position where its experiences and movements will be 
analogous to ours, one may turn it over; then the distinction 
between right side up and bottom side up appears as a fun- 
damental distinction in the experience and behavior of the 
starfish, but for the starfish there is no forward and backward. 
The universal characteristics of space perception arising 
from our common human structures give us all a sufficiently 
definite basis for understanding the spatial experiences of 
others, so that we overlook our individual differences and 
think of space as alike for all human beings. Indeed, in 
ordinary intercourse we think of space as quite as real and 
independent of individual perception as is light or sound 
vibration. To be sure, when a layman compares his per- 
ception of space with that of the artist, the layman realizes 
that he is deficient in a sphere where the artist is expert; 
but even with this difference in mind the layman knows 
that in fundamental characteristics his perception of space 
is like that of the artist. In other words, human nature 
being what it is, all men are fundamentally alike in the 
essentials of space relations. 
It is an interesting speculation to consider what must 
be the form of experience of space of a bird or of a flying
-P-A-G-E-50
  40 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
squirrel. The ordinary standards of comparison with our 
fixed vertical must be replaced by wholly different standards, 
Again we can gain a more vivid conception of the char- 
acter of our own space world by imagining such contrasts 
as are presented to us by the non-Euclidean geometricians. 
Our space is three-dimensional. Imagine a race of intelli- 
gent shadows confined in their movements to a world 
limited to the surface of a table. To such beings many 
of our movements through the third dimension would be 
absolutely unintelligible. If, for example, a shadow living 
on the surface of a table could observe the fact that I take 
a book from the table and bring it down on the other side 
of him, he would be at a loss to know how the book could 
disappear from his world and then reénter it at a new point. 
These contrasts with human space perception give some 
insight into the importance of the statement that all human 
beings are fundamentally alike in their space perceptions. 
PsYCHOLOGICAL GROUNDS OF THE FoRMAL CHARA€TER 
OF GEOMETRY 
Another fact regarding space which is of great moment 
to the student of geometry depends on the general principle 
that space is not a particular kind of sensation, but a gen- 
eral scheme within which all sensations can be arranged. 
We can accordingly study space relations with the aid of 
any available objects. Thus, if one wishes to study the effect 
of rotating one object around another, he does not have to 
secure any particular objects. He can use outline figures 
on the blackboard, or the books which lie on his table, or 
carefully constructed geometrical models. Space is thus a 
very simple kind of experience to demonstrate. The man 
who is blind can understand space relations just as com- 
pletely as the man who sees. Even the fact that the blind 
man is limited in the range of his space perceptions does
-P-A-G-E-51
  THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SPACE 41 
not prevent him from deriving from his limited world all 
of the broader notions of space. Space is a relational aspect 
of experience and appears in the same fundamental forms, 
whatever the sensory contents which are brought into the 
relation. 
In fact, space is so easy to express and demonstrate that 
it becomes in mental life the standard experience in terms 
of which we describe many other relational experiences. 
Thus, when we wish to make a statement about our feelings, 
although they are absolutely unspatial, we speak of them 
as elevating or depressing. When we talk about values 
we describe them as high or low. We speak of all men 
in a democracy as on the same level. These expressions 
show how dominant in human life is this vivid, relational 
experience of space. 
Not merely in crude popular thought is space the typical 
and most readily demonstrated relational experience ; in 
the most exact science, space is used as the convenient 
medium of expressing all relations. If the physicist wishes 
to describe the weights which can be carried by steel or 
concrete of different grades, he assembles all his facts into 
a graph. The graph shows the whole series of varying 
relations. The economist shows by using a graph how stocks 
and bonds fluctuate from day to day and from week to 
week. These uses of space as a means of expressing non- 
spatial facts show, first, that space is a relational fact, 
for otherwise it could not express all the other relational 
facts which are put into graphs; second, that space is the 
most directly perceived and familiar relational fact in 
human experience. They explain also the unique impor- 
tance of the science of space as the science dealing with 
the most familiar and readily demonstrated relational fact 
in conscious experience. They also explain the fact that 
geometry is so often mistaken for logic.
-P-A-G-E-52
42 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
HieHER Forms or REASONING APPLIED TO SPACE 
Before we turn to the study of geometry we must carry 
our psychological analysis one step further: Geometry em- 
ploys certain forms of comparison which are of a higher 
mental order than space perception itself: Thus I can say of 
two squares that they are alike in form. The recognition 
of likeness is of a higher type than the mere recognition of 
the square as a spatial form. I can say of a triangle that it 
has three sides. Here I have exercised a power of analysis 
on my spatial experience and have compared this three-sided 
figure with other figures of more or less numerous sides. 
Enumeration of parts, with its attending analysis, is a process 
of comparison differing from mere recognition of form.

SF 4 
Fie. 5 
The foregoing remark can be amplified by examples of 
comparison at various levels of difficulty. Thus, if I recog- 
nize that the two figures 4 and B (Fig. 5) are alike in form, 
I make a very direct comparison which is hardly more 
elaborate than the direct recognition of the figures com- 
pared. But if I try to compare figures C and D and ask 
whether they are alike in form, I find that I am in difficulty, 
because the figures are complex; and exact comparison re- 
quires a minute discrimination which in turn requires a very 
detailed recognition of the figure, possibly even a counting 
of the sides. Comparison in the latter case will require 
methods which were not necessary in dealing with A and B. 
These cases show us that direct perception of form and 
higher comparisons or scientific study of forms belong to 
different levels of mental life. To see a triangle is one

  THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SPACE 43 
experience; to discover its properties by analysis and 
comparison with other figures is another level of thought, 
involving forms of relational consciousness higher than 
space perception. Undoubtedly one’s perceptions of figures 
will be influenced by his scientific study ; that is, one who 
has studied a pentagon will recognize it more readily and 
more fully than the observer who has not studied it; but 
study and recognition, though mutually interdependent, are 
different in character. 
That study and direct recognition are not the same 
appears from the fact that two persons may gain intimate 
knowledge of the same form by two wholly different routes. 
Thus the practical carpenter who repeatedly cuts out a 
certain form in wood will come to know this shape inti- 
mately. When he sees the familiar form in other settings he 
may recognize it at once. In like degree the geometrician 
may cultivate intimate knowledge of the same form and may 
recognize this form wherever it turns up. The two men 
may both see the form with something like the same detail 
and accuracy. They will, however, differ absolutely in the 
types of experience which attach to their percepts. To one 
the recognition of the shape suggests the tool which cuts out 
the figure ; to the other the shape suggests ideas of angles 
_ to be measured and lines to be projected into infinity. The 
percepts in the two cases have entirely different connec- 
tions and relations, though the accuracy with which they are 
recognized is the same. :   
      
SpAcr PERCEPTION AND SCIENCE OF SPACE 
We may think of one’s space percepts, therefore, as a 
result of those mental processes which from earliest child- 
hood have contributed to one’s recognition of form and 
distance; or we may think of space percepts of lines and 
figures as the raw material to be taken up by higher forms

of comparison into the sphere of a scientific study of spatial 
characteristics. Considered as a product of contact with 
things, space perception is an organized arrangement of 
sensory qualities in a series; considered as material for 
scientific study, space is a group of facts to be analyzed 
and compared with a view to defining more fully the remote 
and less obvious characteristics of particular figures. This 
contrast may be made clear by pointing out one of the prob- 
lems encountered by the teacher of solid geometry. Many a 
student has difficulty with solid geometry because he does 
not know what the flat figure on the page means. His 
teacher expects him to have in mind a solid object filling 
three-dimensional space. He cannot supply the three- 
dimensional idea. It is therefore impossible for him to go 
on intelligently with the study of the solid object. He does 
not have the space idea needed to furnish the raw material 
for scientific studies. Writers on the teaching of geometry 
have urged that it is a mistake to give models and photo- 
graphs to students when they are studying solid geometry. 
The writer saw this pedagogical doctrine carried one step 
further by a teacher who did not draw even the flat figures 
of plane geometry on the board, but required the members 
of the class to keep the figure in mind after it had been 
drawn by a movement of the hand in the air before them. 
This teacher’s contention was that reasoning about figures 
was more exact if the students had the figure in their heads.   
' TEACHING OF GEOMETRY INVOLVES A VARIETY OF 
PROCESSES 
Whether we accept the verdict of those who object to 
concrete forms as aids in the study of geometry or not, one 
fact is certainly clear: there are two problems involved in a 
geometrical demonstration — first, there is the problem of 
making sure that the student has clearly in mind the figure
-P-A-G-E-55
  THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SPACE 45 
which is being discussed; second, there is the problem of 
studying the figure. If the student does not know the figure, 
or if he cannot hold it in mind, he cannot perform the later, 
more complex mental operations of dealing with the figure. 
If one has the figure in mind, then the real business of the 
science of geometry can begin. The science of geometry 
undertakes an analysis and comparison of figures, and in- 
volves higher forms of consciousness than those which are 
cultivated in the perception of forms and distances; but 
it requires a high degree of space perception before the 
student can take up scientific analysis and comparison. 
The conclusions reached in this chapter prepare the way 
for a psychological study of geometry and of the relations 
both of space perception and geometrical analyses to other 
types of thought, especially those which appear in the 
sciences of arithmetic and algebra. By way of summary it 
should be borne in mind that the recognition of space is a 
complex psychological process which develops in the course 
of individual contact with the world, especially through 
movements in the world. Space is not a form of sensation 
and is not dependent on any single group of sensations. It 
is a relational type of consciousness. As the most vivid type 
of relational experience, and as one which can be reproduced 
through our own rearrangements of any convenient objects, 
it serves as the pattern for the expression of all other 
relational forms of experience. Space is in turn capable 
of analysis and comparison; and through these higher 
forms of study, space perception is itself refined and 
clarified and is made the object of an elaborate science.

  CHAPTER IV 
THE PSYCHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF GEOMETRY 
Sources OF MATERIAL 
Inattempting to make a psychological analysis of geometry 
there are several possible sources of material : first, we may 
take a textbook prepared for the use of students, and note 
the mental processes which the successive exercises are in- 
tended to call out; second, we may attend class exercises in 
the subject, and give attention to the mental processes of 
the students, noting incidentally the mental processes of the 
teacher and his ability to recognize what is going on in the 
minds of his students; third, we may go through the vari- 
ous books which have been written on the teaching of 
geometry, noting the problems which are there discussed 
and the solutions offered by the various writers. 
TEXTBOOK METHOD OF EXEMPLIFYING SPACE 
The textbook in geometry which we shall use for the 
purpose of this study begins with a series of definitions of 
the terms which are to be employed. On the first page is 
the figure of a cube. The figure is a less complete basis for 
direct perception than a real cube would be, because it is 
two-dimensional ; but with all of its limitations it furnishes 
a concrete perceptual basis for the study. We pause to note 
that space is one of the simplest materials to present to 
students. Most sciences have to collect their materials at 
1G. A. Wentworth, Elements of Plane and Solid Geometry (edition of 
1889). Ginn and Company. 
46
-P-A-G-E-57
  
    PSYCHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF GEOMETRY 47 
some cost of time and energy, but space is everywhere 
available. The figure of a cube allows the author to begin 
with a definite concrete example of that which his science 
is to study. By looking at the figure given in the book and 
by reading the text, the student is led to recognize the fact 
that the cube has a number of different surfaces, lines, and 
points. The psychological process which is here involved 
is a process of analysis; the parts are distinguished. As 
soon as the student distinguishes the parts of the figure, the 
definitions draw his attention to the fact that the different 
parts of this figure have different characteristics as well as 
different appearances. Thus a side or surface is different 
from an edge or line. 
VALUE OF VERBAL DISCUSSIONS 
The words used in the definition have a double value: 
first, they direct the attention of the student so that he 
selects certain aspects of his percept for attentive consid- 
eration; second, the text helps the student to substitute 
words for his percepts. The use of words instead of figures 
makes it possible to carry on later discussions in a way 
which would not have been possible if space images alone 
were employed. Words are more readily compared, and 
space ideas which have been turned into words are by 
this translation made ready for new and higher nonspatial 
comparisons. Thus the word “line” may be put into all 
kinds of sentence relations; it is a more plastic element 
of experience than is a linear figure. 
In a later chapter we shall have opportunity to comment 
more fully on the flexibility of verbal ideas and upon the 
fact that the human mind tends to carry on all its higher 
processes in verbal form. At the moment we must be satis- 
fied to note that the association of space ideas with words 
raises the mental processes of the student to a level where
-P-A-G-E-58
  48 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
scientific comparisons are rendered easier. This fact is illus- 
trated by the use to which the verbal ideas are put, even 
in the preliminary definitions. Thus we come very soon 
to the statement that a line has only one dimension, namely, 
length. Here the student is called upon not only to relate 
a visual image of a line to a word, but he is called upon to 
strip the visual image of certain of its obvious characteris- 
tics. He knows that every real line which he sees has 
breadth and thickness; but he must learn that it is not 
the purpose of the student of geometry to give attention 
at any time to the breadth and thickness of the particular 
lines with which he has to deal. Words, therefore, help 
the student to carry his analysis beyond the figure as it is 
presented to his senses. This ability to go beyond the real 
experiences in the interests of a special scientific study 
we call abstraction. The use of words in geometry, there- 
fore, is an example of one of those higher forms of thought 
which were discussed in the last chapter, when it was 
pointed out that space is not only recognized, but is also 
compared with other experiences for the purpose of bring- 
ing out characteristics which can be apprehended only 
through higher forms of thought. 
SPECIAL SCIENTIFIC SYMBOLS 
The first page of definitions furthermore exhibits a de- 
vice whereby the student’s attention may be fixed upon 
certain parts of a figure through the use of symbols, which 
are even simpler than words. One corner of the cube is 
designated by the letter 4, another by the letter B, and so 
on. We have here a technical kind of terminology which 
is created for the purposes of geometrical study. The ter- 
minology is relatively simple from one point of view. It 
avoids such circumlocutions as this: “that surface of a 
cube which is turned directly toward the observer,” or “ the
-P-A-G-E-59
PSYCHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF GEOMETRY 49 
corner of the cube which appears at the lower right- 
hand side of the page.” Rather than use these long and 
clumsy descriptive phrases, the author uses a single letter 
or series of letters. By putting letters on the figure, and 
‘ using them in the later discussions, he gives a perfectly 
clear designation to the parts of the figure with which he 
wishes to deal. Such letters are, however, dependent for 
their interpretation on the figures to which they are at- 
tached. Unless one has the figure before him or in mind, 
he will not be able to use the letters. The word “line” or 
the word “surface” each has a meaning which is independ- 
ent of any particular figure or any particular connection 
in which it may be employed. It is therefore a general 
term, or a meaningful term, for all connections; but the 
letter 4 is a specific term relating to a specific figure, useful 
as a technical abbreviation, but not significant when taken 
out of the particular connection in which it is given. Every: 
teacher of geometry knows the disastrous consequences 
which follow when a student fails to keep together in 
thought the letter and the figure to which it properly 
relates. Words are in a measure open to a like objection 
—that the student sometimes goes astray because word 
and meaning get separated; but a letter, for the reasons 
given, is much more in danger of losing its connection. 
AxsstRAcT IDEAS 
Especial attention should, perhaps, be devoted to the type 
of idea which the student is called upon to develop in con- 
nection with the definition of a point as a purely geometri- 
cal conception. “A point,” he is told, “ has no dimensions, 
but denotes position simply.” This definition of a point is 
an effort, as is the definition of a line, to aid the student in 
getting rid of the direct sensory content which is always 
present in any real point which he observes. The definition   
 
-P-A-G-E-60
50 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
illustrates very fully the conclusion which was reached in 
the last chapter, when it was pointed out that space can 
never be recognized except in terms of some kind of sen- 
sory content. One tries by the substitution of an abstract 
verbal idea for sensory content to get rid of as much sen- 
sory content as he can, in order to leave behind the pure 
spatial elements of experience. 
Another definition which may be noted as especially sig- 
nificant for our psychological study is that in which the 
student is told that any figure is a limited portion of space. 
This definition calls attention to the fact that the same 
kind of space extends on all sides of a given figure. There 
is an implication here which comes out more clearly in later 
discussions; namely, the implication that any limited portion 
of space has the fundamental characteristics of all space. 
Indeed, geometry recognizes that all space is absolutely 
homogeneous. Any limited portion of space which is se- 
lected for discussion is a representative of other limited 
portions of space or of space in general. We may regard 
a figure, therefore, as a representative example rather 
than as a single isolated experience significant in itself. 
Thus, while our definition of a point attempts to get rid 
of all the content, the statement that a given figure is a 
limited portion of space attempts to generalize or extend 
the conclusions of any particular discussion to the larger 
field of all space. 
ANALYTICAL STUDIES OF SPACE 
The mental processes required to understand the defini- 
tions which have been discussed up to this point are space 
perception and the higher processes of analysis, abstraction, 
and interpretation of symbols. 
We pass now to another phase of geometrical science. 
Not only are the different parts and aspects of figures to   
     
-P-A-G-E-61
  PSYCHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF GEOMETRY 51 
be distinguished, but the properties of figures and geomet- 
rical elements must be discovered. What can be said about 
a point differs from the definition of the point itself, in that 
higher and more complex groups of ideas are involved. 
Thus one of the statements which is made about the prop- 
erties of a point is that “through a point an indefinite 
number of straight lines may be drawn.” This statement, 
though included among definitions, is not strictly a defini- 
tion. It is, rather, an effort to get the student to consider 
carefully some of the facts which are outside of the point, 
but closely related to it. The statement is put at the be- 
ginning of the science because it is obvious. The student 
can find the truth of this fact if he scrutinizes his experi- 
ences, and brings to clear consciousness that which he can 
readily justify, but which he has probably never before 
recognized with explicit clearness. The words of this state- 
ment are intended to call up in the student’s mind a whole 
series of experiments. He will try to draw different lines 
through an imaginary point, and will note the characteristic 
relation between these different lines and the point. The 
mental process thus induced is relatively direct, but it is 
by no means a mere matter of space perception. It is a 
matter of experimentation and a matter of comparison, with 
a view to discovering and recording explicitly facts which 
will be of use in later elaborate studies. 
By guiding students through such simple experiments 
as these the geometrician prepares them to try all possi- 
ble combinations and recombinations of figures. One can 
imagine, for example, that the first student of geometry 
who explicitly formulated the statement that an indefinite 
number of lines can be drawn through a single point re- 
garded the fact as a discovery. It was a discovery, not of 
an obscure fact, but a discovery in explicit form of a fun- 
damental fact which all along had been present in experi- 
ences, but was now brought to attention as of sufficient
-P-A-G-E-62
  52 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
importance to be treated as a distinct and explicit matter 
of comment. 
There is a large part of geometry which may be described 
as the explicit statement of characteristics which are capa- 
ble of direct observation, but which are not distinguished 
from total experience until geometrical analysis has made 
them clear. The attitude of an ordinary man to one of 
these explicit statements in geometry very frequently is 
that the statement is hardly worth making because it is so 
obvious. The attitude of beginning students is very often 
* one of disregard for these obvious analyses, but it is through 
the combination and recombination of these direct analyses 
that the science of geometry is ultimately developed. All 
of the later propositions in geometry must be traced back 
to postulates; that is, to simple analyses which depend on 
direct experimentation. 
PROBLEM OF PEDAGOGICAL ARRANGEMENT 
It might be questioned whether the textbook in geometry 
ought to give these analyses at the beginning. Certainly 
the recognition on the part of the student of the motive for 
these simple forms of analysis is not complete until after he 
has gone farther in his study. On the other hand, no stu- 
dent will begin to analyze his experiences until someone 
sets him thinking about the. properties of figures. When 
the child begins to play with paper and pencil and finds 
that he can draw a great variety of lines, he is working 
toward the statement that an infinite number of lines can 
be drawn through a single point, but he is not likely to hit 
upon that particular idea until he has cultivated a large 
experience with lines and with points. On the other hand, 
the scientist who has made a careful examination of the 
properties of different geometrical elements comes to realize 
the fact that this statement with regard to lines and points
-P-A-G-E-63
  
  PSYCHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF GEOMETRY 53 
is the logical foundation for many of the more elaborate 
discussions and analyses of space. The writer of a text- 
book, therefore, puts this logically simple proposition at 
the beginning of his science. 
To begin with definitions in any subject requires of the 
immature student some appreciation of values which it is 
quite impossible for him fully to recognize until he has 
progressed to a high degree of knowledge of the subject as 
a whole. Psychologically, therefore, the procedure of the 
geometrician in beginning with definitions cannot be justified 
by the expectation that the matters dealt with in these defini- 
tions will be mastered at once by the student. As we shall 
see later, the early theorems and demonstrations are in reality 
mere repetitions and elaborations of the definitions. The geo- 
metrician undoubtedly holds that the student’s time would 
be greatly economized if he could only take up the subject 
in the order which the mature science recognizes as most 
advantageous for the development of the later, more elabo- 
rate, propositions. Perhaps it is worth the effort to get as 
many of these obvious analyses as possible made, even if it 
becomes necessary to reéstablish the definitions by later 
reiterations in more detailed form. The student may gain 
something by the preliminary statement, even though he 
does not gain all that he might; but the teacher of experi- , 
ence knows how little some students really absorb the first 
time they encounter these simple analyses. 
The practical school problem here presented is one which 
cannot be solved by adopting any single method of pro- 
cedure. In some cases a statement of the definition will 
induce the student to perform the desired mental process ; 
in other cases, elaborate reasoning may have to be resorted 
to before the student is made to see the truth and its 
importance. Possibly one order of procedure could be 
advantageously used by one teacher, while the other order 
would be more successfully used by a second teacher. This
-P-A-G-E-64
54 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
comment indicates the relation between psychological analy- 
sis and the methods of teaching. Psychological analysis does 
not determine what method is best; it simply indicates the 
type of mental process which is to be cultivated. There is, 
therefore, an ample field for experimental treatment of 
school problems that lies beyond the field of psychological 
analysis itself. Methods aim to produce psychological 
results, but there may be several methods of producing a 
given result. The contribution which psychology can make 
to methods may be described by saying that the teacher is 
more likely to understand what he is doing if he considers 
the type of mental process which he is setting up. 
METHODS OF DEVELOPING IDEAS 
It is psychologically interesting to follow the mental 
development at which the author aims in his section defin- 
ing angles. Angles are first defined as “the opening 
between two straight lines.” Gradually this definition 
is amplified until finally we are told that an angle is the 
result of the rotation of a line about a point. The difference 
between these two statements is that in the first statement 
a single definite specimen is chosen as the basis of consid- 
eration. When we take a single angle and consider it as 
a fixed quantity, we may illustrate it and discuss it quite 
apart from any other elements of space. When, on the 
other hand, we generate an angle by rotating a line about 
a point, we show the relationship between any given angle 
and the rest of space. The angle comes to be a part of a 
general spatial scheme. The relation between all angles is 
suggested at the same time the properties of a single angle 
are exhibited. The term “angle” thus comes to have a very 
much broader connotation than it does in the first defini- 
tion. Or one may say that a principle of construction is 
substituted for the figure.
-P-A-G-E-65
  
PSYCHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF GEOMETRY 55 
MetnHops oF TRAINING IN COMPARISON 
The chapter on definitions next explains certain simple 
forms of comparison which are not spatial at all but are 
relational in one of the higher senses referred to in the dis- 
cussions a few pages back. Thus the student is introduced 
to methods of superposition. When two lines are superim- 
posed upon each other or two angles are superimposed on 
each other, they are compared with a view to discovering 
their likenesses and differences. The discovery of likenesses 
among lines is comparable to the discovery of likenesses in 
economic values or the discovery of likenesses in rhetorical 
forms. When we say that likeness or equality is a general 
characteristic discoverable in many different mental experi- 
ences, we must amplify this statement so as to bring out the 
fact that the method of reaching the judgment of likeness is 
different in different cases according to the material com- 
pared. If one compares economic values, for example, he 
does not superpose one value upon another. If one com- 
pares two musical notes, he cannot superimpose them to 
discover whether they have the same pitch. These examples 
show that the comparison of two lines is a special problem 
which requires the student to know not only how to recog- 
nize the one line and the second line but also how to make 
the comparison in a definite and well-ordered fashion. The 
geometrician finds it necessary to direct his student, there- 
fore, in methods of making comparisons. Comparisons are 
necessary in order to bring out the remoter characteristics 
of figures. The single figure is no longer the subject of 
recognition and discussion; the single figure must be 
understood by finding its proper place in science, where 
likeness and unlikeness are quite as significant as distance 
and form. Indeed, for purposes of further mental develop- 
ment and for purposes of application, comparisons are 
indispensable.
-P-A-G-E-66
  56 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
GEOMETRY GOES FAR BEYOND SPACE PERCEPTION 
It is thus made clear that it is a mistake to assume that 
geometry is the art of seeing space. Geometry is rather the 
science of finding out all that can be discovered with regard 
to the characteristics of spatial figures. The scientific in- 
vestigation of the characteristics of figures leads us into 
the most elaborate logical processes of comparison and in- 
ference. Indeed, so large a part of geometry is made up 
of comparisons that the mere recognition of figures is likely 
to drop in the background. We select a few easily acces- 
sible samples of angles and compare these with each other. 
We select a few examples of triangles and compare these 
with each other. The student learns how to make the com- 
parisons in these relatively simple cases. He then general- 
izes his findings in the form of a principle, which principle 
is not a matter of perception at all. 
We may digress for a moment from our study of the 
textbook to call attention to the fact that the science of 
geometry may contribute little or nothing to the student’s 
perception of space. Space, as it confronts the student in 
architectural forms, in the shapes of animals and trees, in 
the perspective of the street, and in the shadows of solid 
objects, may be entirely overlooked while the student buries 
himself in the pages of definitions and comparisons which 
go to make up his book on the science of geometry. To be 
sure, the analytical studies of figures might make the stu- 
dent more intelligent in the observation of form if he would 
apply his analysis to objects about him. It has been one of 
the mistakes of the modern school that it has assumed that 
the student can readily carry over his textbook studies into 
ordinary life. What is needed is more attention to the ob- 
servation and analysis of all forms. The student must be 
taught geometrical analysis, and, at the same time, he must 
be taught to apply this analysis to figures outside of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-67
  PSYCHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF GEOMETRY 57 
textbook. In later chapters we shall have occasion to come 
back to this problem of generalizing experience. For the 
moment we must be content to leave the matter, with a 
reiteration of the statement that geometrical analysis and 
space perception are different processes, and that there is a 
possibility of their developing in the student’s mind quite 
apart from each other. The student must, however, in any 
case, have enouyh space perception to furnish the basis for 
his complete scientific study. 
GEOMETRY AND MECHANICS 
Returning to our examination of the textbook, we find 
after superposition a discussion of symmetry. The type of 
comparison here involved is higher than that required to 
discover equality. In superposition one thinks of a spatial 
element brought into the closest possible relation to a sec- 
ond spatial element with which comparison is to be made. 
In the case of symmetry the two spatial facts to be com- 
pared lie on opposite sides of the center of comparison. The 
mind must therefore pass from one side of the symmetrical 
figure to the other in making its comparisons. Further- 
more, the elements must be compared with due regard 
to the fact that in their present relationship they resist 
superposition. 
As pointed out in the last chapter, all of our space ideas 
are developed in a world where movements must follow 
mechanical laws. Consequently, all our space experiences 
contain a large element of conformity to mechanical laws. 
Symmetry of spatial figures is an aspect of space perception ‘ 
which differs radically from that aspect which we refer to 
by such terms as “length” and “distance.” Length and 
distance depend upon quantity of experiences, but symmetry 
depends rather upon a recognition of mechanical balance. 
When we deal with symmetry, therefore, we are dealing
-P-A-G-E-68
58 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
with a special aspect of space experience. Geometry has 
never been satisfied to regard comparison through symme- 
try as of equal fundamental reliability with comparison 
through superposition. When, for example, one wishes to 
deal with the vertical angles which are made by two inter- 
secting lines, or with the relations of the angles formed by 
a line crossing a pair of parallels, he finds himself trying to 
reduce an experience which is primarily an experience of 
symmetry to that type of comparison which we have in super- 
position. The geometrician frankly acknowledges that this 
effort to reduce symmetry to superposition is artificial and 
probably unnecessary, but he does not feel satisfied to rest 
his geometrical demonstrations upon the recognition of sym- 
metry, because such recognition seems to be more indirect. 
Thus we see that a psychological analysis of the notion 
of symmetry throws an interesting light on an ancient geo- 
metrical discussion. Symmetry is not as direct as super- 
position. Superposition in turn is not as direct as simple 
perception. Possibilities of error increase with the increas- 
ing complexity of the psychological processes. Stating the 
successive stages of probable error explicitly, we may say 
that the perception of a line is simpler than the comparison 
of one line with another. The comparison of one line with 
another when they are placed side by side is easier than 
the comparison of two lines which balance each other on 
two sides of a point. Geometry gives us a definition of 
a line which is looked upon as unquestionable. Geometry 
makes certain fundamental and very direct comparisons of 
lines by superposition. In practical experiences these super- 
positions become more and more uncertain as the objects 
superimposed become more complex. All the difficulties 
which arise in measuring can be cited as examples of in- 
creasing difficulty of comparison, for in processes of meas- 
urement we have to deal with complex superpositions. 
Finally, geometry becomes very cautious when comparisons
-P-A-G-E-69
    
PSYCHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF GEOMETRY 59 
begin to depend on a recognition or demonstration of sym- 
metry. Here it is insisted that the problem be broken up 
into elements and the comparisons reduced, if possible, to 
one of the simpler forms. 
WorkKING DEFINITIONS INCLUDED IN GEOMETRY 
We may pass over briefly the paragraph of definitions 
dealing with such terms as “ proof,” “ theorem,” and “ prob- 
lem.” These definitions of terms are not directly concerned 
with space, but are intended to indicate to the student the 
various different modes of procedure which are followed in 
performing geometrical analyses and comparisons. For ex- 
ample, when the definition of a construction is given, the 
definition is merely the statement that in certain cases cer- 
tain preliminary steps must be taken by the student in 
order that he get a clear notion of what he is going to do. 
Geometry has to employ such terms describing procedure 
in order to set the student at work on the problems ‘which 
are to be solved. Such terms as these are not, as stated 
above, spatial; some of them are not even logical terms ; 
they are working terms used in collecting the material for 
geometrical comparisons. 
LogicAL DEFINITIONS 
We come finally to a discussion of axioms and postulates. 
The postulates are to be distinguished from the axioms by 
the fact that postulates describe spatial experiences, whereas 
the axioms refer rather to the fundamental laws of thinking 
which are valid for all sorts of processes of comparison. 
Thus the first postulate states that a straight line can be 
drawn from any point to any other point. Contrast this 
with the first axiom, which states that things which are 
equal to the same thing are equal to each other. The 
 
-P-A-G-E-70
60 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
postulate deals with a spatial fact. The axiom, on the other 
hand, is not a statement of a spatial fact at all; itis rather 
a fundamental principle of a logical type. It is important 
to note while making this distinction that the logical 
axioms of geometry are always looked upon by geome- 
tricians as parts of their science. This fact gives increasing 
evidence in support of the conclusion pointed out before, 
that the science of geometry is so absorbed in directing and 
controlling processes of comparison that in many instances 
the spatial material on which these logical processes are 
exercised sinks into the background. Geometricians often 
neglect space and emphasize logic. The result is that in 
many cases the student is trained not, in the observation 
of lines and figures, but chiefly in the methods of making 
logical comparisons. It is possible to find students of geom- 
etry quite unobserving of form. This situation will be 
understood wherever it is found that the primary emphasis 
is on axioms. 
THEOREMS CONTRASTED WITH DEFINITIONS 
We turn now to the first book and find that the early 
theorems are elaborations of the definitions given in the 
preliminary pages. These early demonstrations are so direct 
and obvious that the psychological analyst is at first in 
doubt as to the possibility of discovering any new mental 
processes not found in the foregoing study of definitions. 
However, on closer study a clear psychological and peda- 
gogical difference appears between definitions and demon- 
strations. A definition is a closed, compact statement. A 
demonstration is a detailed and explicit unraveling of the 
situation. In. a demonstration, however simple, one phase 
after another of the total situation is scrutinized and reduced 
to the form of a separate statement. While the early theo- 
rems do not use very complex series of statements, they train,
-P-A-G-E-71
  PSYCHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF GEOMETRY 61 
the student in the use of a form of analysis which was 
assumed but not demanded in the definitions. If the student 
can be trained in analyzing a situation which is fairly obvi- 
ous, he will be better prepared to take up situations which 
are not obvious. Furthermore, this explicit analysis serves 
to review many of the statements included in the introduc- 
tory chapter on definitions. 
Finally, one notes as he examines the demonstrations 
that they are made up of successive steps, which steps 
must be held together in one general mental process. This 
process of holding together the products of analysis calls 
for a type and reach of attention which is higher than that 
which is required in learning a definition. To hold in mind 
a single question, and bring to bear in answering this ques- 
tion a chain of evidence, is a higher type of reasoning than 
that which is involved in mastering a single final statement. 
The later demonstrations which appear as one progresses 
through the text involve in increasing degree this power of 
combining the results of successive steps of analysis. They 
also involve retention and recall of the results of earlier 
discussions. It would be interesting to find out in what 
terms different students remember propositions. Doubtless 
there are some students who recall vividly the spatial fig- 
ures; others recall the verbal formulas used in stating the 
theorems; others think of the steps of reasoning. The ability 
of a given student to use his knowledge of a theorem in 
later demonstrations is undoubtedly related very closely to 
the form in which propositions studied earlier lie in his mind. 
PsycHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF ORIGINAL PROBLEMS 
The last remark leads us to a consideration of the dif- 
ference between a demonstration and a so-called original 
exercise. In the original exercise the student must first 
analyze the situation which is propounded, and then he
-P-A-G-E-72
62 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
must be able to draw out of the fund of experience which 
he has accumulated the principles which will help him in 
solving his complex present experience. There is no rule 
which can be learned to guide in solving originals, because 
the solution depends on the student’s ability to look around 
in his mind and find among the contents of his experience 
the propositions which fit the present case. The psychologi- 
cal process can be described after it has taken place; but it 
cannot be prophesied in advance, because the student may 
make his analysis in one of many different ways, and he 
may make many a failure in trying to fit one remembered 
proposition after another into the present situation before 
he finds the right combination to complete the thought 
process. The only way to teach a student to solve origi- 
nals is to teach him how to analyze a new problem and 
how to seek among his store of experiences. A demonstra- 
tion given in the text, on the other hand, requires only 
ability to follow the statements that are set down in the 
book. The student does not have to search around in his 
mind among the many possible combinations; he has only 
to follow one combination which is given. The student 
gets inferior training when he merely follows another’s 
lead. If he stops to think at all how the author hit on 
the solution of his problem, he is apt lazily to set aside 
the question because it seems unnecessary. 
The student should in some way gain an insight into the 
methods employed by the author in solving his problem. 
Whenever it is possible more than one solution of the prob- 
lem should be presented, and the merits and demerits of each 
solution should be discussed. Some comments on method 
should be introduced into the text itself. The only possible 
justification for giving a student a solution is to train him 
in methods of solving problems economically and in rigid 
form. The mistake is too often made of dragging a stu- 
dent along too rapidly over a path which someone else has
-P-A-G-E-73
  PSYCHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF GEOMETRY 63 
mysteriously marked out. The student walks in the path, 
but never for a moment thinks of stepping out of it or mov- 
ing faster than his guide. Geometry learned under such 
conditions becomes the most formal kind of drill in memory. 
Students thus trained never can apply what they learn. 
Indeed, they are more and more bound down by every lesson 
they study to a slavish adherence to the text. Rote memory 
is thus unfortunately substituted for the supposed scien- 
tific analysis of space, which is the aim set by the teacher 
of geometry for his work. 
PsycHoLoGicAL MATERIAL DERIVED FROM OBSERVA- 
TION oF CLASS WorK 
Turning now from the textbook to the students, we must 
note one general fact; the reactions of students to the les- 
sons set for them are infinite in their variety. No psycho- 
logical principle is more strikingly proved by every class 
exercise than the principle that mental life shows marked 
individual variations. The effort to give an outline of some 
of these individual variations may seem to experienced 
teachers labored and meager in results, but it will be 
undertaken in the hope of stimulating these experienced 
teachers to record their broader observations. For the pur- 
poses of this study the writer visited a class of second-year 
students who had been studying geometry for seven months. 
The class exercise preceding the one visited had been de- 
voted to the study of the two general theorems: “ If a circle 
is divided into equal parts, and if the successive points of 
division are connected by line-segments, the polygon so 
formed is a regular inserted polygon”; and “If a circle 
is divided into equal parts, and if tangents are drawn at 
the points of division, a regular circumscribed polygon is 
formed.” The members of the class were not required 
to make any outside preparation, and during the period 
 
-P-A-G-E-74
64 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
they inscribed and circumscribed squares, octagons, and 
hexagons, and developed the demonstrations related to their 
constructions. During the exercise several types of diffi- 
culty arose. 
LoaicAL PROCESSES DISTINGUISHED FROM PROCESSES 
oF Direct KNOWLEDGE 
One member of the class inscribed a square in a circle by 
first drawing diameters perpendicular to each other. The 
proof following this construction should have proceeded 
from the equality of the angles at the center of the circle to 
the equality of the arcs subtended by equal angles, and so on. 
After the construction had been completed and proof was 
called for, however, it became apparent that the members of 
the class knew all the facts necessary to prove that they 
had inscribed the square, but they did not readily arrange 
their facts in logical order. They were not able to take the 
strictly analytical view and to proceed step by step to the 
end sought. The trouble in this case was that the spatial 
facts were known, and the individual items of the proof 
were known, but the notion of an organized logical demon- 
stration was deficient. Thus one student insisted on starting 
with the fact that the arcs of the circle are equal when log- 
ically it was necessary to show first that the arcs are equal. 
Such errors of using the converse in proof are familiar 
errors in the work of geometry students. They do not bear 
“in mind what is given and what is to be proved. It cannot 
e said that they are deficient in memory. ‘They know all 
the facts. Their deficiency is altogether in their lack of 
appreciation of the demands of logic. The student is con- 
fused at times because as an observer of space relations his 
comments are quite right and equally obvious to him. He 
cannot distinguish between his knowledge of space and the 
logical process of demonstration.
-P-A-G-E-75

PSYCHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF GEOMETRY 65 
Again, the opposite type of difficulty appeared in two 
cases when students were not able to pass from a logical 
demonstration to the spatial fact. The first of these two 
cases was as follows: After the square was inscribed, the 
question was asked, “ What other figures can now be readily 
drawn ?” The answer was given, “An eight-sided figure, by 
bisecting the central angles or by bisecting the ares.” The 
instructor put marks on the circumference assuming that 
the bisecting had been done. The new points were named 
F, K, etc. The next step in construction was to connect 
these new points with the old points 4, B, etc., but the 
student who had correctly stated that the ares should be 
bisected did not see how to go on. She suggested connect- 
ing 7, one of the new points, with K, another of the new 
points. Her confusion increased when objection was raised. 
Evidently when she described the method of getting eight 
sides, she was thinking in abstract terms and could not, 
even with the figure before her, see at once the space rela- 
tions involved. Another case of a similar type appeared 
when the class began to discuss constructing a hexagon. 
One member of the class — knowing that the division of the 
circumference could be made with the aid of the radius — 
began to work on the problem by going back to the value 
of 7. Once started on this kind of reasoning, the student 
could not give it up. Even after the figure was drawn 
and on the board, the desire to deal with the matter in 
terms of 7m reappeared. The fact that the circumference 
had in no case been measured was of no avail in getting 
this student’s mind off 7. That train of ideas once started, 
the solution was sought abstractly and persistently in the 
single unproductive direction. The figure before the eyes 
was neglected in favor of an idea in thought which was 
so vivid and insistent that the student could not get 
away from it. 
 
-P-A-G-E-76
66 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
PRACTICAL PROCEDURE AND SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS 
A third type of difficulty appeared because the member 
of the class who began the problem of inscribing the hexa- 
gon knew that the method of procedure was to measure off 
chords equal to the radius, but he did not know the reason 
for this method. He got the result in terms that seemed 
satisfactory so far as the figure showed, but he was soon 
persuaded by the instructor that he had no evidence that 
his last chord was equal to the radius. He then was lost. 
He did not know how to go back and get the fundamental 
fact that he needed equal central angles. A rule of proce- 
dure is very often far enough removed from the fundamental 
fact so that once the mind is fixed on the rule of procedure 
it is very difficult to adopt the logical attitude. Even when 
the student saw that his rule was not a demonstration, he 
could not get away from the circumference long enough 
to think of the angles at the center. The mode of approach 
was confusing because it turned attention in the wrong 
direction. The instructor said that in other classes the fact 
that the central angle is the important fact is usually rec- 
ognized. Perhaps it would have been better in this case to 
have criticized the boy when he began with a practical rule 
of procedure. On the other hand, the independence of the 
class is quite as much at stake as logical procedure, and 
the class undoubtedly must face cases where the wrong 
entrance on the problem occurs and must be overcome. 
The class finally discovered the equilateral triangles re- 
quired for demonstration and worked out the proof, but 
the student who began could not. He was committed to 
his practical rule and could not get a point of departure 
suitable for the proof. He illustrated by his attitude of 
mind the antithesis so common in life between the practi- 
cal and the theoretical method of dealing with situations.

DIFFERENT SPHERES OF EXPERIENCE IN GEOMETRY 
Up to this point we have seen three spheres of experi- 
ence, each of which is so different from the others that 
transition out of the one into another is difficult. These 
three spheres are first, space perception; second, an abStract 
system of logical steps constituting proof; and third, rules 
of practical procedure. That the transition from one sphere 
of experience to the other is a new mental process is of the 
first importance to the teacher of geometry. The teacher 
sees now that knowledge of theory, knowledge of the prac- 
tical procedure, and direct percepts of space are all separate 
problems to be worked out; and, furthermore, he sees that 
the student must be trained to pass from one to the other. 
Educational methodology has long recognized that there 
are various spheres of experience, but very little explicit 
attention has been given to the complete enumeration of 
these or to carrying the student from one sphere to the 
other. The student is supposed to gain the power of such 
transition by learning demonstrations, but the fact is that 
transitions constitute in many cases the most confusing and 
difficult part of the problem. More instructorial energy 
should be devoted to training students in these transitions. 
There should be a conscious effort to view the matter from 
each of the possible points of view, and to pass from one 
point of view to the other with full knowledge of the reason 
for the transition. Furthermore, the student should see 
that the fact which is essential for demonstration is often 
very different from the point of highest attention to the 
practical operator or to the observer of space. Only through 
a fuller cultivation of all of these methods of thought can 
the student gain the advantages which come from each. 
So long as he is rapid and skillful only in one mode he 
will be limited in his resources. If he is master of all and 
can use all, he will be more efficient. -—

DANGER OF RELIANCE ON SocraL AIDS 
A number of minor difficulties appeared during the lesson. 
Several times superficial answers were given. Thus, in the 
course of the discussion the question arose, What is one third 
of 360 degrees? One student replied successively 60, 90, 
180 degrees. As the instructor waited, the student showed 
some confusion, and finally stopped long enough to get the 
correct 120. She evidently had a vague notion of the equal 
subdivisions of 360 degrees, and, without trying to be spe- 
cific and get the particular division needed, tried several pos- 
sible answers, depending on her social surroundings to check 
herup. This use of social checks is often most advantageous; 
but here it is evidently bad for the student that she could 
rely on the instructor to correct her carelessness. Her social 
dependence in this case operated to make her mental proc- 
esses vague and haphazard. 
PROBLEM OF DEALING WITH MISTAKES ™ 
Another example of vagueness appeared when one of 
the students was asked how to draw a tangent at a point. 
He directed that the radius touching the point be extended, 
and then directed that a line be drawn bisecting this 
indefinitely extended radius. He probably had vaguely in 
view the fact that a perpendicular can be erected by laying 
off on a line equal distances from the point at which the 
perpendicular is to be erected; but he continued to be very 
vague about bisecting, and finally the class moved on, 
leaving his vagueness forever behind, corrected in the sense 
that the right answer was given, but uncorrected in the 
sense that the impossibility of his answer was never fully 
explained. Every error of this type furnishes an educational 
opportunity to find out what the student is thinking about 
and lead him back over the wrong path to the point where  
-P-A-G-E-79
  PSYCHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF GEOMETRY 69 
he can take a right start. How far mistakes ought thus to 
be taken seriously is hard to determine. The rights of the 
rest of the class must be considered. The student whose 
vagueness is not corrected undoubtedly suffers. 
ANALYSIS CONTROLLED THROUGH RECENT AND 
Direct EXPERIENCE 
Students evidently do not use the general demonstrations 
which they have reached with any degree of confidence ; 
they go back to the simpler and more fundamental theorems. 
Thus the instructor could not get the class to use the gen- 
eral theorems proved the day before. They insisted on 
going back to prove that the sides were equal because the 
angles were equal. The interest in simple fundamental 
theorems undoubtedly expresses the feeling which everyone 
has, that the simpler demonstrations most nearly related to 
direct observations are more reliable than proofs dependent 
on elaborate demonstrations. 
At one point in the exercise the class had been dis- 
cussing the relation of the side of the inscribed square to 
the radius. They then turned to the circumscribed square, 
and the question arose regarding the length of the sides 
of the circumscribed square. The discussion which followed 
showed two facts: first, the size of the circumscribed 
square was seen directly from the figure long before the 
proof of its size could be given; and second, the particular 
fact which was observed in the figure was the length of 
half of one side of the cireumscribed square. This concen- 
tration on half the side of the square was plainly due to 
the preceding discussion of the radius, for the relation of 
the whole side to the diameter was quite as obvious from 
inspection of the figure. This incident illustrates two im- 
portant facts: first, geometry even at this advanced stage 
uses the facts of space perception in guiding theory and in
-P-A-G-E-80
    70 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH/SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
discovering relations; and secgnd, the part of the figure on 
which attention was last concentrated is likely to be the 
o_o g point of the next step in observation and reasoning. 
The first fact demonstrates that geometry is at all stages 
dependent in many ways on perception; the second shows 
the importance of preparation \as a stage in instruction. 
DIFFICULTIES OF ABSTRACTION 
In marking off the points on the circumference to be 
used in constructing the hexagon, the student began with 
the point A. The instructor tried to get a statement of the 
way in which this point was selected; and after some per- 
sistence developed the correct logical statement that it is 
“any point.” The student had difficulty in recognizing the 
point as indefinite in its location, because to his eye and mind 
it was a very definite and particular point. The instructor 
straightened the matter out by contrasting A with B, C, ete. 
All the later points were to the eye equally definite, but 
the student was led to see that B was definite only in re- 
spect to 4. When he got back to A he could not get it from 
any earlier point, and so saw that it was “any point.” Com- 
parison leads to knowledge of the properties of a point, and 
shows the student that knowledge of properties of a point 
\ is very different from direct perception of the point itself. 
\ Memory As A Factor in EpucATION 
All through the lesson it was evident that the students 
were being called on to use their memories and to select 
from the propositions and facts stored up in memory. A 
chapter could be written on this aspect of the lesson. We 
have of late come to regard memory work in the schools 
as something unworthy of recognition in comparison with 
reasoning and the higher thought-processes. No one who
-P-A-G-E-81
  PSYCHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF GEOMETRY 71 
gives the matter any serious thought can, however, fail to 
recognize the fact that the criticism of memory is not based 
on any real expectation on the part of teachers that 
students will be able to carry on the higher processes 
without an appeal to memory. Criticisms of memory are 
directed not against memory, but against bad forms of 
remembering. Again and again the members of the class 
were required to go back into their memories and select 
the theorems necessary for progress in the demonstration 
in hand. Sometimes they offered an irrelevant theorem. 
This showed lack of discrimination in selection, or it showed 
poverty in the stock of ideas from which the selection 
could be made. When we speak of working out a demon- 
stration, it is evident that the material stored in memory 
must be in form to permit selection and rapid review for 
the purpose of facilitating selective thought. One general 
principle of memory which immediately suggests itself in 
terms of the instructor’s questions is the principle of arrange- 
ment. What do you know about equilateral triangles ? 
What do you know about lines that are perpendicular to 
parallel lines? These are examples of questions which 
were asked with a view to helping students to classify 
knowledge. Furthermore, the classification must evidently 
not be too rigid, else the proposition which is needed now 
to illuminate the discussion from the point of view of the 
size of angles will not be available later when the same 
fundamental fact is needed in connection with the dis- 
cussion of areas. Memory must therefore contain items 
classified in a variety of ways. When the student goes 
back into his store of experiences, he must find there many 
propositions ready for use in many different connections. 
To such a flexible memory there can be no objection. To 
a well-ordered body of knowledge, especially if it is well- 
ordered in many different directions, there can be no ob- 
jection. From these statements of what is demanded of
-P-A-G-E-82
——| 
\ 
| 
  72 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
memory we begin to see how memory should be trained. 
If one wishes to have his students flexible and ready in 
ideas, then he must give them that type of memory train- 
ing which will make them both ready and flexible. The 
problem of modern teaching is not to discard memory, but 
rather to train the powers of retention and recall in a better 
way than formerly. To object to memory is very short- 
sighted; to improve memory is rational. 
We shall come back to this problem later. It is enough 
to point out here that ideas must be put into the mind 
a—f with their possible relationships clearly recognized if these 
\ relationships are at some later day to be used productively 
\ in calling out the ideas. It is therefore important, when an 
idea is given, so to store it up in the mind that it shall be —\ 
flexible and ready. One is tempted even at this stage of 
the discussion to point out that much of what has been 
said about the doctrine of formal discipline has been utterly 
at sea because it has not been based on this conception of 
the way in which ideas ought to be given. If ordinary school 
training does not transfer from one field of experience to 
another, this is not due to the inability of the human mind 
to transfer its training. The lack of transfer is in many 
cases due to the clumsy, stereotyped way in which ideas 
were put into the mind, The absence of general ideas and 
general habits of thought resulting from school work is 
due to poor teaching rather than to any limitations of 
the mind. Knowledge that does not transfer is inflexible 
and inert. It is badly remembered and was badly acquired. 
It shows that the mind is capable of taking in highly spe- 
cialized ideas; it does not show that the mind is incapable 
of generalized experience, for generalization is seen to be 
dependent on the arrangement or organization of experi- 
ences. This matter will be fully discussed in a later chapter 
where the problem of organizing all experience so as to 
facilitate transfer will be the topic under discussion.
-P-A-G-E-83

REASONING PROCESSES 
This discussion brings us to a consideration of the 
psychology of reasoning processes. Reasoning is the re- 
arrangement and recombination of ideas. Reasoning in- 
volves memory and classification of experiences and the 
combining of the experiences which belong together in 
leading to a definite conclusion. The process of thus 
organizing and recombining experiences is one of the most 
important and, at the same time, one of the most baffling 
for the teacher to induce in a student. There is no specific 
tule which can be followed in cultivating the reasoning 
powers. The various facts which must ultimately be fitted 
together come up in one mind in one order, in another 
mind in a different order. Often the needed fact is coupled 
in memory with irrelevant facts. These irrelevant facts 
must be rejected, and the useful facts must be recognized 
and held in mind until the whole fabric of the reasoning 
processes is woven together in a complex pattern. The 
teacher must stimulate to continued effort, must guide in 
the selection and rejection of elements, must point out 
that the seledtion of elements depends on the end sought. 
The end must be anticipated in general before it is reached 
in particular. This must all be done;in such a way as to 
keep the student active and, so far as possible, free-from 
dependence on the teacher and on other membérs of 
the class. lo 
Such a description of reasoning leaves one with only 
general maxims such as the following: First try to fore- 
see in a general way what end you want to reach. Next 
marshal all the facts you can find which are related to this 
end. Then arrange these facts in a progressive series. Such 
maxims describe what may very properly be called the 
general problem of the teacher. They also describe certain 
general mental habits and attitudes.

GENERAL PsYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS 
We may close our comments on class observation by 
noting that there are certain general psychological princi- 
ples suggested by a visit to any class. The individuals in 
the class show marked individual mental and social charac- 
teristics. One student is aggressive and talkative, inter- 
rupting on the slightest provocation, full of energy and 
ready to attack any problem; another is quiet, undemon- 
strative, shy, and embarrassed. 
Again, the relation of the teacher to the students is dis- 
tinctly a psychological problem. Students and teachers alike 
are absorbed in certain reasoning processes; they are all in 
the midst of psychological situations which are of great inter- 
est to the student of psychology, but which are viewed by the 
active participants in these processes from a wholly unpsy- 
chological point of view. The teacher will realize how direct 
and personal and unpsychological he usually is by undertak- 
ing, at some time when he is not absorbed in teaching, to 
make psychological studies of his students and their mental 
processes. When he is teaching, there is less opportunity to 
give attention to both the content of the discussion and the 
psychology of the student’s difficulties. Later, after he has 
studied the psychology of the situation, he will be able to find 
in every class exercise opportunity to apply his discoveries. 
There is, finally, the general emotional situation as it 
changes from moment to moment. The class and teacher 
in sympathy working together; the single student confused 
and unable to reason because he has made a mistake and is 
being laughed at, and, consequently, is more acutely aware 
of the other members of the class than he should be; the 
egotistical member of the class who prefers to hear himself 
rather than wait for ideas to justify speech —all these are 
interesting psychological problems, but they are general, 
and not especially appropriate to an analysis of geometry.

THE THEORY OF TEACHING MATHEMATICS 
From observations of students we turn to books on the 
methods of teaching geometry. Some of these books are 
written without any attempt to deal with the psychology 
of the situation ; others are full of psychological statements. 
For the purposes of our study we may refer to two books: 
one nonpsychological, the other very largely colored by 
psychological interests and discussions. Let the reader try 
the experiment of going over one of these books with a 
view to raising explicitly all the psychological questions 
that are referred to or implied in the text. Frequently the 
author will suggest interesting psychological problems 
and discussions even when the treatment in the book is 
wholly unpsychological. 
ScHULTZE ON MEmMorY 
Let us consider first a passage from Schultze’s “ Teach- 
ing of Mathematics in Secondary Schools”! (pp. 10-11), in 
which the author deals with matters which are evidently 
psychological. 
In the preceding paragraph it was pointed out that mechan- 
ical memorizing is a perfectly proper method of studying the 
most elementary, the most fundamental facts, which are of fre- 
quent application. This is possibly the reason why the teach- 
ing is far more effective in the lower grades than later on. In 
more advanced work the very nature of the subjects makes 
mere memorizing ineffective. 
' Our high schools, however, not only encourage memorizing, 
but sometimes almost force the student to adopt this as the 
only mode of study, for only by memorizing can he hope to 
satisfy the immediate demands of the school. ) 
The daily rations of mental food that the student has to 
swallow give him no choice; there is no time for thought, for

  76 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
meditation, for judicious study ; he must memorize. Moreover, 
the character of the studies leads him to mechanical work, for 
in spite of the vigorous denials of our pedagogues, the greater 
part of the curriculum is informational. It is knowledge and 
not power that is emphasized in most of the studies, and even 
subjects which by their very nature should be mastered by 
thinking are often made informational. For the informational 
method produces much quicker and more spectacular results 
than the slow judicious mode of study. What a fine display of 
learning students can make if they have been cramming con- 
scientiously! How high the percentage they can secure in ex- 
aminations! True, the after effects are sad, but who cares? 
As long as the boy can talk glibly about complex economic 
problems in terms which he does not understand, we are satis- 
fied. What does it matter, that a year later he has not the 
remotest inkling of the subject, that he cannot discuss intelli- 
gently the simplest new problem that may arise! 
Can we wonder that under such conditions the student never 
breaks away from his mechanical way of studying that he ac- 
quired in the elementary school? And can we wonder, too, that 
the results of our teaching become inferior in the higher grades 
of the grammar school, and especially so in the high school ? 
As one reads such a criticism of the schools he cannot 
help wishing that the author had been more explicit about 
the meaning of the term “mechanical memorizing.” Just 
how does this differ in character from nonmechanical ? 
And how far does the “slow judicious mode of study ” in- 
volve memory ? Surely a student who does not know the 
theorems he has passed over will be slow indeed, and prob- 
ably far from judicious in his thinking. Is it true that ele- 
mentary education is made up of memorizing? It is a 
common habit of high-school teachers without very much 
knowledge of the real conditions in elementary schools to 
give liberally of their advice about what is and ought to 
be the task of the lower schools. If our author would talk 
over this matter with some good elementary teacher, he
-P-A-G-E-87
  PSYCHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF GEOMETRY 177 
would find that the elementary teachers have the same 
problem that he has. What does anyone mean when he says 
that most of the curriculum is informational? Has our 
author measured the amount of time devoted in most 
schools to such noninformational studies as drill in lan- 
guage and to exercises in writing and speaking ? Probably 
not; for if he had, he would hardly have made the statement 
which he makes. In short, our author does not contribute 
any very clear ideas on the value of memory in geometry 
and algebra. We should be left in a bad plight if we had 
nothing but the prejudice against memory which this pas- 
sage is calculated to foster. Indeed, our author is himself 
so prejudiced against memory that he writes (p. 18), 
“The principal value of mathematical studies arises from the 
facts that it exercises the reasoning power more, and claims 
from the memory less than any other secondary school sub- 
ject.” The trouble is that he has got his mind fixed on a con- 
trast between two processes, namely reasoning and memory, 
which are psychologically not opposed to each other at all. 
ScHULTZE ON AXIOMS AND POSTULATES 
Another discussion by the same author relates to the 
difficulty of introducing the work without confusing the 
student by elaborate proofs and discussions which seem to 
him unnecessary and cumbersome (pp. 88-89). 
The most fundamental propositions in geometry, such as 
“straight angles are equal” or “the complements of equal 
angles are equal,” are frequently designated preliminary 
propositions. These preliminary propositions have certain 
peculiarities which make them less adapted to produce an 
understanding of geometry than are the theorems that follow. 
In the first place, these propositions state facts which are 
so self-evident that the beginner does not see the necessity of 
proving them. That right angles are equal, or that only one
-P-A-G-E-88
78 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
perpendicular to a given line can be drawn at a given point, 
are facts so obvious that their certainty does not appear to 
become greater by demonstrations of any sort. 
In the second place, proofs of exceedingly simple facts are 
often difficult, and hence it is not surprising that many of the 
demonstrations given for the preliminary propositions are not 
the same simple deductions that are usually employed in geom- 
etry, but rather artificial devices. To the beginner such proofs 
frequently appear as unintelligible, complicated statements, the 
truth of which is far more doubtful than that of the theorems 
to be proved. 
Although absolute rigor is utterly unattainable when present- 
ing this subject in a secondary school, many textbooks sacrifice 
pedagogic considerations in the attempt to present the prelim- 
inary propositions rigorously. Whether or not the student can 
fully comprehend the presentation seems to be a matter of 
minor importance with some authors. ‘We must have rigor, 
absolute exactness, training in logic from the first day on, 
otherwise,” so these dogmatists claim, “the student will be 
hopelessly led into the habit of slipshod thinking from which 
no further training can redeem him.” This striving for rigor 
is undoubtedly responsible for the highly artificial character 
and the complexity of the preliminary propositions as given 
in a great many textbooks. 
The psychology of this difficulty certainly calls for earnest 
attention on the part of teachers. How can a matter be 
clear, and yet difficult to translate into a train of logical 
reasoning ? The answer offered in an earlier paragraph of 
this chapter (p. 60) is that we are here dealing with two 
spheres of experience. Transition from one to the other is 
the real difficulty. If this answer is not acceptable, then it 
devolves upon someone to go further, because the problem 
is an urgent one for the teacher. Indeed, the problem here 
presented raises the-interesting question whether geometry 
of a simple type ought not to be given in the elementary 
schools where the simpler and less rigorous types of thought 
are recognized as more at home.
-P-A-G-E-89
PSYCHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF GEOMETRY 79 
ScHULTZE ON IMAGERY 
Another psychological problem which our author presents 
is that of imagery (pp. 266-268) : 
The study of solid geometry strengthens the student’s space 
imagination and his power to image space configurations, and 
it gives him an understanding for drawings that represent 
spatial objects. 
Altogether it seems that the utilitarian advantages are some- 
what greater, but the purely cultural advantages somewhat 
smaller, than in plane geometry. 
With such restrictions the study of solid geometry will not 
offer great difficulty to the student. It may require a little 
more time and a little more study, but it does not require more 
intelligence than does plane geometry. 
One difficulty, however, against which we must guard and 
which we must overcome at the very start is the inability of 
some students to understand diagrams of solids. There are 
students who are able to reason logically, but who cannot imag- 
ine clearly the spatial forms which the diagrams represent. 
There are two ways of overcoming this difficulty, namely, the 
use of models and rational methods of drawing. 
The function of the model is to help the student in the 
beginning to an understanding of solid figures in general, and 
to make clear to him, later on, difficult drawings which other- 
wise he would not understand. The model should, however, 
not be used to supplant the drawing. As soon as the student 
is able to understand the drawings, the models should be dis- 
carded or reserved for the most difficult cases only. Otherwise 
the student will lose one of the main benefits of the study, 
namely, the development of his space imagination and of his 
faculty to understand diagrams of solids./ 
  There are other passages, of like import, which cannot be 
quoted in full. These all raise at once — and in a very vivid 
way —the question of imagery. How does imagery differ 
from reasoning? Why is it more difficult to imagine solid 
figures than to imagine plane? Is it true that one of the —S
-P-A-G-E-90
  80 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
functions of geometry as taught in the schools is to culti- 
vate the power of imagery? It is interesting to note that 
the experience of schools shows that students are deficient. 
Why should we be more deficient in this matter than the 
Greeks or the Japanese? Is it not because the school has 
left space to develop as best it can in the mind of the stu- 
dent without the legitimate help which would come from 
instruction in spatial relations all through the period of 
education prior to that in which the student encounters 
high-school geometry? If so fundamental a power as the 
interpretation of a drawing of a solid is lacking in high- 
school students, is it probable, in the light of experience, 
that a course in demonstrative geometry administered in the 
high school will cure the difficulty ? Is it not rather the duty 
of the school to put into the elementary course at an early 
point some constructive geometry? Indeed, it seems very 
clear to the unbiased student that it is to the interest of 
the geometrician himself that he be persuaded to look about 
for ways of cultivating space imagery which are more effi- 
cient than those afforded in the logical courses now offered 
in demonstrative- geometry. 
ScHULTZE ON ForMAL DISCIPLINE 
One problem which always turns up in educational dis- 
cussions is the problem of mental discipline. Thus, our 
author writes: 1! 
Some psychologists claim that there is no such thing as 
general mental discipline, that the disciplinary value pertains 
only to the subject studied, or to one of similar content, and 
that consequently mathematical study increases the reasoning 
power for mathematics only. 
It cannot be denied that there is a little truth in the first 
part of this assertion, and that this theory has produced some 
1 Schultze, pp. 24-25.
-P-A-G-E-91
  PSYCHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF GEOMETRY 81 
reaction against the practice of defending any pedagogical 
absurdity on grounds of “ mental discipline.” But on the other 
hand there is a tendency among the sensational pedagogues 
to exaggerate and to generalize too sweepingly. Pedagogy and . 
psychology are not exact sciences. Their results are only 
approximately true, and cannot be applied in the same rigorous 
fashion as those of mathematics or physics. If we attempt to 
apply them to complex preblems, the limits of error are likely 
to become so large as to invalidate the entire results. Conclu- 
sions reached by such methods need constant verification, and 
must be modified if found to be contradictory to experience. 
Precisely this thing happens in this widely advertised disci- 
pline theory when we apply it to mathematical teaching. Every 
mathematical teacher of experience has seen cases which dis- 
prove this theory. It is a common experience to see a pupil in the 
upper grades suddenly wake up to the meaning of mathematics, 
and thereby change his attitude towards study in general. 
On the matter here discussed we shall later enlarge in a 
full chapter devoted to a review of recent discussions of 
formal discipline. 
SmirH oN ForMAL DIscIPLiIne 
The importance of a rediscussion of the whole matter 
will be obvious when we put together two quotations from 
another leading author : 1 
There have been those who did not proclaim the utilitarian 
value of geometry, but who fell into as serious an error, 
namely, the advocating of geometry as a means of training 
the memory. In times not so very far past, and to some extent 
to-day, the memorizing of proofs has been justified on this 
ground. This error has, however, been fully exposed by our 
modern psychologists. They have shown that the person who 
memorizes the propositions of Euclid by number is no more 
capable of memorizing other facts than he was before, and 
1David E. Smith, The Teaching of Geometry, p. 12. Ginn and Com 
pany, 1911.
-P-A-G-E-92
ee et | 
82 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
that the learning of proofs verbatim is of no assistance what- 
ever in retaining matter that is helpful in other lines of work. 
Geometry, therefore, as a training of the memory is of no more 
value than any other subject in the curriculum. 
A few pages later the same author holds that logical 
training will carry over (p. 17). 
In spite of the results of the very meager experiments of 
the psychologists, it is probable that the man who has had 
some drill in syllogisms, and who has learned to select the 
essentials and to neglect the nonessentials in reaching his con- 
clusions, has acquired habits in reasoning that will help him in 
every line of work. 
ScHULTZE ON COMPARATIVE DIFFICULTY OF ALGEBRA 
AND GEOMETRY 
Another problem on which every writer expresses himself _ 
is the character and difficulty of algebra as compared with 
geometry. The following quotations refer to this problem.! 
The selection of the subject-matter for courses in elementary 
algebra must largely depend upon the educational advantages 
of the subject, which are not absolutely identical with those of 
geometry. Algebra requires the same accuracy of thinking, 
and the same, or possibly greater accuracy of detail than geome- 
try. It may be graded as perfectly, and its introductory chapters 
may be made even simpler than those of geometry. The defi- 
niteness of the task given to the student, the certainty of the 
results, and the applicability of many of its topics to scientific 
or other problems are precisely the same as in geometry. 
On the other hand, algebra does not require as much reason- 
ing, and this reasoning is not always of the same high order as 
geometry. The amount of information cannot be reduced quite 
as much as in geometry, and some topics in algebra require a 
certain amount of mechanical drill. Hence, ingenuity and 
originality of thinking do not play quite the same réle, and the 
1 Schultze, pp. 288-289,
-P-A-G-E-93
  PSYCHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF GEOMETRY 83 
knowledge of facts is somewhat more important than in geom- 
etry. Moreover, algebra lends itself rather readily to a purely 
mechanical treatment. Students may add exponents, transpose 
terms, and perform other manipulations without having a clear 
notion of the meaning of these operations, and the symbols 
involved. 
Thus, while possessing most of the advantages of other 
mathematical branches, algebra has certain drawbacks, and the 
courses of study should be so arranged as to eliminate or to 
minimize these disadvantages. 
This passage raises a whole series of psychological prob- 
lems with which we shall have to deal when we have made 
an analysis of algebra. In the meantime we may quote 
once more from Professor Smith! on the same topic. 
SMITH ON THE RELATIVE DIFFICULTY OF ALGEBRA 
AND GEOMETRY 
The child studies form in the kindergarten before he studies 
number, and this is sound educational policy. He studies form, 
in mensuration, throughout his course in arithmetic, and this, 
too, is good educational policy. This kind of geometry very 
properly precedes algebra. But the demonstrations of geometry, 
the study by pupils of fourteen years of a geometry that was 
written for college students and always studied by them until 
about fifty years ago, — that is by no means as easy as the study 
of a simple algebraic symbolism and its application to easy 
equations. If geometry is to be taught for the same reason as 
at present, it cannot advantageously be taught earlier than now 
without much simplification, and it cannot successfully be fused 
with algebra save by some teacher who is willing to sacrifice 
an undue amount of energy to no really worthy purpose. 
This paragraph suggests a number of interesting psycho- 
logical questions. Why should different stages of the study 
of space be separated as they now are? Why should the 
study of geometry continue in its present form ? 
1 The Teaching of Geometry, p. 88.
-P-A-G-E-94
84 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
If there are various kinds of geometry, then the limits of 
each are certainly worthy of definition. How far should direct 
space perception appear in the later studies of geometrical 
propositions, as well as in the elementary studies ? Suppose 
that we find the studies of mensuration made in arithmetic 
by the ordinary elementary-school child to be quite as ab- 
stract as the theorems in geometry; will this justify our 
taking a different attitude than that announced in the para- 
graph? Why should geometry not be simplified ? Is algebra 
made up of “simple symbolism” and “ easy equations” ? 
SmirH ON THE APPLICATION OF GEOMETRY 
As pointed out in the introductory discussion in Chap- 
ter II, geometry and its applications are different. The psy- 
chology of applications is a topic which will naturally come 
up again in discussing the technical subjects. We shall not 
be able to enter into a complete discussion of the matter in 
this connection, but there is a good opportunity here to get 
the problem clearly before us. 
In his second chapter and throughout the book Profes- 
sor Smith discusses the problem of the practical application 
of geometry. He points out that in the sixteenth and seven- 
teenth centuries (p. 10) there were large numbers of treatises 
published on the subject of practical geometry. On page 11 
he reaches the following conclusion : 
Out of all this effort some genuine good remains, but rela- 
tively not very much. And so it will be with the present 
movement [that is, the movement in the direction of applied 
geometry]; it will serve its greatest purpose in making teachers 
think and read, and in adding to their interest and enthusiasm 
and to the interest of their pupils; but it will not greatly 
change geometry, because no serious person ever believed that 
geometry was taught chiefly for practical purposes, or was made 
more interesting or valuable through such a pretense.
-P-A-G-E-95
    a) ence ate 
PSYCHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF GEOMETRY 85 
A further passage dealing with the same topic appears 
on page 74. 
And as to the exercises, what is the basis of selection? In 
general, let it be said that any exercise that pretends to be real 
should be so, and that words taken from science or measure- 
ments do not necessarily make the problem genuine. To take 
a proposition and apply it in a manner that the world never 
sanctions is to indulge in deceit. On the other hand, wholly to 
neglect the common applications of geometry to handwork of 
various kinds is to miss one of our great opportunities to make 
the subject vital to the pupil, to arouse new interest, and to 
give a meaning to it that is otherwise wanting. It should always 
be remembered that mental discipline, whatever the phrase may 
mean, can as readily be obtained from a genuine application 
of a theorem as from a mere geometric puzzle. On the other 
hand, it is evident that not more than 25 per cent of proposi- 
tions have any genuine applications outside of geometry, and »—~ 
that if we are to attempt any applications at all, these must be 
sought mainly in the field of pure geometry. In the exercises, 
therefore, we seek to-day a sane and a balanced book, giving 
equal weight to theory and to practice, to the demands of the 
artisan and to those of the mathematician, to the applications 
of concrete science and to those of pure geometry, thus making 
a fusion of pure and applied mathematics, with the latter as 
prominent as the supply of genuine problems permits. 
In drawing this contrast Professor Smith has done us 
the great service of calling attention to the fact that the 
mental processes involved in applications of geometry are 
different from the mental processes aroused during the dem--——~ 
onstration of theorems. If we recognize clearly this conclu- 
sion, we shall see the necessity of studying the processes of 
application in order that we may train them and in order 
that we may understand their value. The assumption of 
the school in times past has been that students will work 
out the applications of the theories which they learn in 
school in a natural and spontaneous way. There is of 
 
-P-A-G-E-96
  86 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
course, in practical life, little justification for the pious hope 
that applications of science will take care of themselves. 
There is ample evidence that a student must be shown how 
to use his mental equipment before it becomes available in 
circumstances other than those in which it was acquired. 
Let us assume that some of the applications found in 
the school are artificial in character. Is it not true that 
any general scheme of education is in this sense relatively 
artificial? Is not the whole period of dependent, unpro- 
ductive childhood and youth a relatively artificial period ? 
It may be said that the child who imitates his elders in a 
game is doing something that is highly artificial; the girl 
with her dolls or the boy with his carpenter’s tools is cer- 
tainly not making an application of his powers to any situ- 
ation which can be thought of as productive. But this very 
artificial opportunity of employing one’s powers is of the 
greatest advantage to the child; it is the purpose of nature 
during this period of dependency to furnish the child with 
leisure to experiment. There is no better exercise for the 
memory and no better exercise for the growing mind than 
to set up some kind of situation and face it with a view to 
solving its difficulties — not because the solution is going 
to be marketable or because it is going to modify the real 
world of affairs, but because it is going to give the individual 
poise and new equipment and new ability to carry over 
what he has acquired in one field into another situation 
which does not contain the elements of the original situation. 
Such an artificial situation trains one’s knowledge and skill. 
One reads in the educational literature of the day the 
statement that the school should be a real world. One 
reads that the child will not attack the problems of the 
school with any enthusiasm unless the school can be made 
as real as the business world is for an adult. The answer 
to many of these statements is that the world of action is 
real even when situations are merely imagined situations.   
     
-P-A-G-E-97
  
PSYCHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF GEOMETRY 87 
In order to be real, a situation does not need to be produc- 
tive for society; it does not need to modify the physical 
world in any definite way. The situation is real if it calls 
for a mental adjustment on the part of the child or a 
conscious readjustment of his behavior. In this sense the 
applications of geometry to relatively artificial situations 
may be immensely real for the student who is working 
them out, although from the point of view of adult society 
they may be very artificial and insignificant. 
It is enough for our present purpose if the problem is 
clearly before us. The solution of the problem must be 
sought in connection with the discussion of the place of 
the practical arts in school work. 
SMITH ON THE REASONS FOR THE STUDY OF GEOMETRY 
One final quotation from Professor Smith suggests an 
interesting psychological problem. On page 15 he con- 
cludes his discussion of the reasons why we teach and 
study geometry with the following: 
Probably the primary reason, if we do not attempt to deceive 
ourselves, is pleasure. We study music because music gives 
us pleasure, not necessarily our own music, but good music, 
whether ours, or, as is more probable, that of others. We 
study literature because we derive pleasure from books .. .. 
At any rate, these are the nobler reasons for their study. 
So it is with geometry. We study it because we derive 
pleasure from contact with a great and ancient body of learn- 
ing that has occupied the attention of master minds during 
the thousands of years in which it has been perfected, and we 
are uplifted by it. 
The student of psychology is instantly struck by the fact 
that Professor Smith’s argument at this point is by no means 
fundamental. He does not go to the bottom of the matter 
when he says that we derive pleasure from this sort of 
study. Pleasure itself is an experience which needs some
-P-A-G-E-98
  88 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
explanation. There are as many different kinds of pleasure 
as there are different types of mental attitudes. If geom- 
etry gives pleasure, this result must be due to the fact that 
in some fashion or other geometry sets up forms of behavior 
and forms of mental activity that are in keeping with the 
demands of the individual’s nature. No form of experience 
is pleasurable unless it is in some fundamental way in keep- 
ing with the demands of the individual. Therefore, when 
our author states that we derive pleasure from geometry, 
he gives a descriptive account of the situation and not an 
explanation of it. To offer pleasure as the prime reason 
for the study of geometry is to take only one step in the 
direction of a real explanation. 
Suppose, for example, that we try two or three of the 
different hypotheses that might be suggested as back of 
Professor Smith’s statement. Thus we might hold with 
certain metaphysicians that geometry gives pleasure be- 
cause in this sphere the mind is operating in a world of its 
own creation. Geometry is nothing but a creation of one’s 
véwn consciousness, and consequently geometry is more fully 
and satisfactorily understood than any other system of ex- 
perience. Geometry therefore gives the mind an opportu- 
nity to work over with pleasure its own creations. 
On the other hand, we may turn to an entirely different 
interpretation of the situation. We may say that geometry 
is a more concrete subject than most of the others offered 
in the course of study. The student can see his sensory 
experiences unite in a well-organized and connected system. 
Thus, for example, when one tries to find out the sum of the 
angles of a triangle, he is not at liberty to modify the real, 
objective facts in any particular, and the more he experi- 
ments with these facts, the more stubbornly concrete they 
become, while at the same time the more thoroughly reli- 
able they are to his thinking. After he has experimented 
with five triangles he can go on to fifty or five hundred,
-P-A-G-E-99
  PSYCHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF GEOMETRY 89 
and he will always find that the result is the same with re- 
gard to the sum of the angles. Experience of this type is 
very concrete and objective; and the high degree of satis- 
faction which the student derives from this contact with a 
series of experiences which are uniform is the satisfaction 
which comes from a definite understanding of the real world. 
Both of these statements would comport with Professor 
Smith’s statement regarding pleasure, and yet they are fun- 
damentally opposed in their teachings regarding the nature 
of geometry. The problem of why geometry gives pleasure 
is therefore a deeper problem than the mere assertion of the 
fact. Furthermore, there are many known cases where the 
study of geometry does not give pleasure to the student. 
The problem of how to produce a readjustment in such 
cases is a very urgent human problem. We shall certainly 
need to inquire, in such negative cases, what is the psy- 
chological character of pleasure, and what the possibility of. 
so readjusting the situation as to produce pleasure through 
the study of geometry. Suppose we tell students that they 
will ultimately derive pleasure from tasks which at the 
outset do not afford pleasure, we shall be deep in the psy- 
chology of pleasure, and we shall be greatly concerned to 
discover the formula by which geometry can be used as an 
instrument for giving the ultimate pleasure promised. 
The reader who has had the courage to follow the dis- 
cussions of the last few pages will be convinced that it is 
relatively easy to raise psychological questions. The answers 
to some of these questions are not always easy to find. Our 
present purpose has, however, been served if the method of 
raising questions has been demonstrated. Answering some 
of these questions will be the work of later chapters. We 
shall therefore close the special treatment of geometry and 
turn for a time to the analysis of algebra, returning, after 
some discussion of algebra, to the question of the relation 
between geometry and the other branches of mathematics.
-P-A-G-E-100
  CHAPTER V 
THE PSYCHOLOGY OF NUMBER AND ABSTRACTION 
The psychological analysis of algebra must be introduced 
by a consideration, first, of the psychology of number, and 
second, by a consideration of the psychology of abstraction. 
Algebra is a generalized arithmetic, and as such is related 
historically to the science of number rather than to the 
science of space. This historical relation was the subject 
of brief comment in an earlier chapter and need not be 
elaborated here. 
NuMBER CONSCIOUSNESS A ForM OF COMPARISON 
The mental process which appears in number conscious- 
ness is in essence one of the many forms of comparison. 
The objects to be counted are related in consciousness to 
some set of objects, or to some standard series of ideas, 
which serve as tallies. Thus, when primitive man came 
to possess so many cattle or tents that he could no longer 
remember them individually, he began to compare his pos- 
sessions to convenient and more readily manageable sets of 
objects which served as tallies. The word “calculate” and 
related words show that the ancient Roman used peb- 
bles (calculus, “a pebble”) for the purpose in question. He 
looked at one sheep or one ox and set aside a pebble as a 
reminder of this item of his wealth. The pebble thus set 
aside was easy to manage, and it was a safe reminder, for 
it was soon found to be invariably true that if there had 
once been a one-to-one correspondence between tallies and 
90 ;
-P-A-G-E-101
  EEN RIOR PGCE Se ey ee A, RT ae ee eT ee Ce ee ee ee 
NUMBER AND ABSTRACTION 91 
objects, there would always be a one-to-one correspondence. 
That is, if a pebble had been set aside for a sheep, then later 
there must be a sheep for each pebble. 
The common series on which primitive man depended 
to thus remind himself of his possessions was the series of 
digits which he always had as convenient objects of im- 
mediate reference. The fingers exercised a significant and 
formative influence on the methods of counting. We can 
understand this influence only when we consider many facts 
regarding the fingers as a system of tallies. Thus we may 
comment in detail on one essential characteristic of the 
fingers which influenced the mind in making up number 
systems. The fingers are a limited group and require, in 
addition to themselves, certain supplementary devices which 
make it possible to use them over and over again in tally- 
ing off large collections of objects. The number system 
becomes, therefore, a series of multiples, and much of the 
terminology of number deals with this repeating of the base. 
Furthermore, the decimal base and the base of five which ap- 
pear in many number schemes are not mathematically nec- 
essary. The base might equally well have been six or twelve 
or some other small, easily recognized number. In the se- 
lection of ten we see the influence of the fingers. In the 
struggles through which primitive people passed in develop- 
ing a number terminology which should include many tens, 
we see the embarrassments and limitations which grew out of 
the limited system of tallies which the hand made available. 
Worps As SUBSTITUTES FOR TALLIES 
After primitive man became familiar with the advantages 
of a one-to-one comparison of objects with a system of tal- 
lies, it was natural that he should translate the system. of 
tallying which he had evolved into a system of words. The 
number terms used by primitive peoples. exhibit almost 
 
-P-A-G-E-102
  92 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
universally the direct relation of number words to the hand- 
tally system. Thus one historian! remarks: 
The number five is generally represented by the open hand, 
and it is said that in almost all languages the words “ five” and 
“hand” are derived from the same root. . . . The only tribes 
of whom I have read who did not count in terms either of five 
or of some multiple of five are the Bolans of West Africa, who 
are said to have counted by multiples of seven, and the Maoris, 
who are said to have counted by multiples of eleven. 
The creation of a series of words which could be substi- 
tuted for the objects used as tallies is a long process. Such 
a series of words has the disadvantage over a series of tal- 
lies that the word disappears as soon as it is uttered. Imag- 
ine a speaker saying over to himself, “one, one, one,” and 
so on, as the items of his property pass in review. Evi- 
dently such a series of ones is of no use in keeping tally, 
because the tally system is less easy to remember than the 
objects taken directly. The words used in the tally system 
must be distinguishable, and, furthermore, each word must 
have a fixed place in the number series. The importance 
of giving a number word a fixed place in the series is seen 
when we observe little children who know number words, 
but do not know their order. A little child will count with- 
out recognition of order, saying “three, seven, one, five.” 
A few moments later he will say “nine, six, one, three.” 
He does not know the order of these words, hence he 
cannot count in any true sense. 
HicHER ForMs or CoMPARISON APPLIED TO NUMBERS 
We cannot here enter into the details of the history of 
number terminology. Let us assume that a race or indi- 
vidual has learned to count, and has a developed number

NUMBER AND ABSTRACTION 93 
terminology. There are still higher forms of thought which 
number makes possible. Thus, suppose there are side by 
side two heaps of pebbles representing the Roman’s count 
of his properties. He wishes now to combine or divide the 
two parts of his property represented by these two heaps 
of tallies. He can do this in various ways: either he can go 
back to the things themselves, or he can carry on the re- 
distribution with the aid of his tallies. There is a third way 
which he might adopt: he might divide up the images of 
his possessions which he carries in memory. Finally, he 
might adopt the most elaborate and complex method of 
all: he might first translate his property into tallies, and 
then do his readjusting by thinking about his tallies. The 
method of relying on tallies proved to be the simplest. 
Man also found very soon that there are certain regular 
principles which assert themselves in the combination and 
recombination of tallies. The discovery of these regular 
principles of combination in tally systems led to the inven- 
tion of counting and adding machines such as the abacus. 
An abacus is a mechanical contrivance to facilitate combin- 
ing and recombining groups of tallies. The psychological 
effect of using this machine is that the individual becomes 
expert in rearranging sets of tallies; this is a higher proc- 
ess than that involved in counting. 
Again, we cannot enter into the history of adding and 
dividing devices. We are, however, interested in the fact, 
for which there is abundant historical evidence, that when 
men found how elaborately numbers can be combined and 
recombined, some of them became so absorbed in this mere 
working over of number systems that they forgot the rela- 
tion of numbers to things. Numbers became things of a 
higher order — they were of interest not because of what 
they represented, but because of their own laws of combi- 
nation and recombination. We speak to-day of pure num- 
ber as distinguished from applications. The expression
-P-A-G-E-104
94 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
“pure numbers” indicates that the number system has an 
interest to the student of the laws of number combination, 
even though the process of combination and recombination 
is not directly related to any perceptual experience. 
NUMBERS DISTINCT FROM SYSTEMS OF MEASUREMENT 
Number systems and principles of number combination 
and recombination are, in our present-day civilization, inti- 
mately related to all kinds of systems of measurement. It 
should be recognized, however, that numbers are not to be 
confused with standards of measurement. Thus, when one 
uses a foot ruler to measure distance and a dollar to meas- 
ure money values, he can apply the principles of number 
combinations in exactly the same way to two wholly differ- 
ent standards and to two wholly different sets of experi- 
ences. The creation of a standard foot is not a phase of 
number consciousness. Number is used in dealing with the 
foot, but the selection of the foot, and the devices adopted 
for applying the foot to other spaces which are to be meas- 
ured, are not problems of number. 
The distinction between the pure number idea and the 
practical arts of applying standards to objects is a distinc- 
tion which needs to be emphasized by the student of 
education. Educational literature has at times confused 
these two different psychological processes, and our text- 
books are full of admixtures of the two. Thus, in all school 
arithmetics the tables of weights and measures are given as 
apart of the science of number. That the tables of weights 
and measures are not arithmetical in character, as are the 
addition table or multiplication table, is seen in the simple 
fact that French arithmetic is the same as English arithmetic 
in so far as it presents the tables of pure number and number 
recombination, but French and English books are wholly 
different'in the standard weights and measures presented.
-P-A-G-E-105
  NUMBER AND ABSTRACTION 95 
The selection of a standard greatly promotes the appli- 
cation of number to practical life, and a standard could not 
be used to any advantage if there were no number system; 
but the intimate relation of the two does not justify the 
notion that they are psychologically the same. 
For our study of algebra it is of the highest importance 
that we distinguish between measurement and number 
combinations. Algebra is a science which studies the laws 
of number recombination without any reference to stand- 
ards of measurement. The student who has been studying 
weights and measures in the upper grades of the elemen- 
tary school comes into high-school algebra and finds no 
tables of weights and measures. He finds some of the famil- 
iar forms of combination which he used in arithmetic, but 
these combinations are freed, as far as possible, in algebra 
from direct reference to any particular standards of meas- 
urement. Algebra does not measure; it establishes and 
expounds laws of combination and recombination. It is an 
abstract science of the laws of mathematical combination, 
it is not a final chapter of the ordinary arithmetic; such 
chapters invariably deal with applications of mathematical 
laws to complex measurements. 
ALGEBRA A SCIENCE oF HIGHER ABSTRACTION 
Take, for example, the simple algebraic statement 
a(b+c) =ab + ae. 
This statement sets forth a fundamental and universal law 
of combination, but it says not a word about standards. 
The algebraic formula is a device for stripping the process 
of combination, as far as possible, of all content, and with 
the content removed, we face the one question, How can 
quantitative ideas -be recombined? We are dealing here 
with an abstract matter of rearrangement.
-P-A-G-E-106
96 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
This concentration of attention on the laws of combina- 
tion and the neglect of all concrete aspects of situations 
is a form of abstraction. We must therefore study more 
completely the psychology of abstraction. Abstraction is a 
form of mental activity which begins with analysis. Through 
analysis we cut off in thought certain elements of a percep- 
tual experience, and concentrate on a single characteristic 
or on a limited group of characteristics. We saw one type 
of abstraction when we were considering the geometrical 
definitions of lines and points. The perceived line has 
width and color as the observer sees it, but we do not want 
to consider the width or the color in geometry ; we accord- 
ingly neglect them and say that a line has only one charac- 
teristic, namely, length. The point is described as having 
no sensory properties, no color, not even dimensions. That 
means that in geometry we must neglect all those sensory 
properties which we see when we look at real points. The 
neglect of certain aspects of a situation is the negative side 
of abstraction. On the positive side we concentrate atten- 
tion on those facts which constitute the real subject matter 
of our science. Thus a line has length; a point has position. 
For geometry the laws of position and extension are the 
only facts worth considering in the experiences which we 
derive from points and lines. 
THE DEVELOPMENT oF ForMs oF ABSTRACTION 
The example of abstraction which was borrowed from 
geometry is by no means the simplest example that could 
be found. We are constantly making abstractions in our 
dealing with objects in that we neglect certain parts of the 
sensory experiences which come to us as we look at each 
object. For example, when talking with a person we neglect 
practically all of the visual experiences which come to us 
from the walls of the room or the objects in the room. We
-P-A-G-E-107
  NUMBER AND ABSTRACTION 97 
thus cut off or abstract the person from his surroundings. 
If we are talking with a larger number of people in the 
same room, we include more sensory elements; we even 
make use of the visual images which we get from the walls, 
in order to adjust. properly the vigor with which we articu- 
late. Our mental and physical attitudes are very different 
when we are thinking of many people and when we are 
thinking of a single person. Our attitudes are thus seen to 
be relatively independent of the sensory impressions offered 
to us. We may therefore conclude that abstractions and 
activities are closely related. 
The reason why we analyze our experiences and concen- 
trate on certain selected portions of them is that we are 
able to react at any given moment only to one aspect of 
the whole situation. Those parts of the situation to which 
we react are of enough greater importance to us so that we 
recognize them more clearly in consciousness than we do 
the elements of the situation to which we do not react. In 
some cases we deliberately react for the purpose of helping 
ourselves to discriminate. Thus, if one points his finger in 
a certain direction, he finds that he can concentrate his 
attention and the attention of his audience very much better 
through this act than through any other means. The ges- 
ture of pointing is, therefore, an instrument of analysis. In 
the same way there are certain reactions of the eyes which 
aid analysis. If one points to a particular object and focuses 
his eyes upon that object, he brings out the meaning and 
value of the object on which he focuses very much more 
vividly than he could if his eyes simply wandered about the 
room. Indeed, in visual analysis, nature has codperated by 
making the central part of the retina very different, in its 
structure and in its ability to receive impressions, from the 
rest of the retina. Consequently, a person who looks with 
fixed vision not only has the advantage of the movement by 
which he concentrates attention on a given object, but he also
-P-A-G-E-108
98 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
has a clearer and more vivid group of sensory experiences 
from an object which is seen with the center of the retina. 
Many of our movements are designed to bring us into 
more intimate sensory contact with the objects of attention. 
Thus, if after looking at an object for a time I go to it and 
take it in my hand, I am not only helping myself to neglect 
the rest of my environment and to concentrate attention 
on the one object through my movement, but I have also 
increased my sensory contact with the object. All these 
examples show how important are the analyses which we 
are constantly making of our experiences. 
WorDs THE CHIEF INSTRUMENTS OF ABSTRACTION 
We have, in addition to the various forms of movement 
which have been described above, an important instrument 
of analysis in the words which we employ. If I look at a 
general surface and observe at first its general character- 
istics, and then use a single word to designate its color, 
I aid myself in the analysis of the situation by the use of 
this word. The value of the word is not merely that I ex- 
press an idea. The greatest value of the word is that I am 
thus aided in making an analysis of my own experience. 
I distinguish between the color and the other characteristics 
of the object through the word as an instrument of discrim- 
ination. After I have thus made analysis by means of a 
word, the word comes to stand in my experience for the 
characteristic which it designates. In later cases the word 
may be used to bring up in the mind a picture or image 
of the selected characteristic. On the other hand, in many 
cases the word does not recall the characteristic in any 
vivid way. It merely makes the characteristic available 
without concrete imagery. Thus, if one uses the word 
“blue,” he can safely contrast blue with other colors, re- 
marking to himself that blue is different from red or green.
-P-A-G-E-109
  NUMBER AND ABSTRACTION 99 
In such a contrast of words we do not need vivid pictures 
of the colors themselves to become aware of the differences 
between the sensory qualities to which the words refer; 
the very difference between the names is significant for our 
thought. The fact that one has separate words for various 
color experiences records the fact that these experiences 
are different. Indeed, one can talk about this difference 
without realizing exactly what the difference is. In short, 
one can concentrate attention on a difference depending 
wholly upon two words without calling up the actual sen- 
sory images at all. To be sure, if one wanted to do so, he 
could usually think this difference out in sensory terms, 
but for the most part one saves time and energy by not 
trying to think out the difference in full. It is more eco- 
nomical for one to do his thinking and comparing in words. 
In all these cases we see how the mind operates through 
symbols, that is, through representative experiences which 
are substituted for direct experiences. The use of symbols 
is also, as seen in these examples, related to selective 
thought or abstraction. 
In the same way there is a relation between a given word 
and the more general word under which it is classified. 
When I use the two words “color” and “blue,” I do not 
have to stop and work out the matter in a sensory way. I 
have learned how to use thé words as substitutes for the 
experience, and I know that the word “color” is a general 
word and that blue is classified under it as a specific term. 
If now I go on and use a still more highly specialized 
term such as “navy blue,” the words themselves serve to 
indicate that I am dealing with a subclass. Even a person 
who has not seen navy blue would realize that this word 
designates a more specific experience than does the general 
word “ blue.” 
We see by these examples how the process of abstraction 
is more than a process of mere analysis. The first stage of
-P-A-G-E-110
  100 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
abstraction is to neglect certain of the facts of the environ- 
ment and to concentrate attention on the others; the second 
stage of abstraction is that in which we substitute products 
of our thought for real experiences, and by using these prod- 
ucts of our thought we carry on more rapidly and efficiently 
all sorts of complex comparisons and discriminations. 
DANGERS OF ABSTRACTION 
In some cases, to be sure, our symbols, or substitutes for 
experience, get so far away from the real sensory images 
that we have difficulty in carrying on our trains of thought 
in such a way that they are productive as guides for later 
contact with the world of direct sensory experiences. We 
then speak of our abstract thinking as too abstract, or we 
treat our mental processes as mere speculations. Thus, to 
use one more example from geometry, we may assume, 
with the non-Euclidean geometricians, that parallel lines 
meet if they are extended. This assumption that parallel 
lines meet is made for the purpose of comparing a wholly 
abstract or assumed space with the space which we know 
in Euclidean geometry where parallel lines do not meet. 
There is no difficulty whatsoever in talking about parallel 
lines that meet. In the world of complete abstraction, that 
is, in the world of thought about lines, we may think of lines 
in any way that seems to us to be desirable; but we cannot 
take the results of such thought back into the world of prac- 
tice or even into the world of direct imagery. Anyone who, 
after speculating for a time about different kinds of possible 
space, should try to lay railroad rails, on the assumption 
that parallel lines meet, would find himself in difficulty. 
Speculation and practical life thus frequently need to be 
distinguished from each other. Indeed, the distinction is so 
evident that perhaps the better statement of the case is to 
say that the two forms of experience need reconciliation.
-P-A-G-E-111
NUMBER AND ABSTRACTION 101 
ADVANTAGES OF ABSTRACTION 
Nor is the value of speculation to be questioned even 
when the results are not directly applicable to common 
life. Very frequently it is important that we should con- 
trast our experiences in various ways, in order that we may 
learn to understand the characteristics of real experience. 
One who has studied non-Euclidean geometry for a time 
realizes very much more vividly than he ever realized be- 
fore the importance of the statement that in the space 
which we know parallel lines do not meet. The contrast 
has helped him to understand in a new way what he has 
always seen but never fully realized. 
The mental exercise which comes from contrasting pos- 
sible experiences is thus seen to be of value. In the same 
way in many of our demonstrations in geometry we assume 
the contrary, and by the process of reductio ad absurdum 
we demonstrate the fact that the assumption which we have 
made is untenable. The argument in this case is a purely 
speculative argument. We assume that things might be 
different from real experience for the sake of coming back 
with greater assurance to the real experiences which will 
not conform to our speculation. 
SpecIAL MEANS oF MATHEMATICAL ABSTRACTION 
There are instruments of abstraction other than words ; 
or, perhaps, the better way to put the case will be to draw 
attention to the fact that after language developed, other 
forms of experience were brought into conformity with 
language and were made abstract in a sense even more 
general than speech itself. Thus written words came to 
stand for spoken words. At the outset written symbols 
were of an entirely different type from those which we 
now have, but so significant is oral speech as an instrument 
 
-P-A-G-E-112
  102 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
for abstraction and analysis that the visual symbols took on 
all the characteristics of spoken words. Then came a new 
and additional development. The written word, having 
taken on all the characteristics of the abstract spoken 
word, began to exhibit abstract possibilities of a higher 
order than even the oral word. The mere sight of a word 
now makes comparative thought possible. For example, 
when the two words “blue” and “color” appear on the 
printed page, the word “blue” is recognized as a specific 
term under the general term “color.” This is done without 
any complete articulation, or any clear representation of the 
visual experiences to which the words refer or even of the 
auditory experience arising from the utterance of the word. 
Any careful analysis of the reading process shows that we 
tend to keep alive more or less the articulation which is 
connected with the word; but this articulation, as we shall 
note more fully in a later chapter, gradually grows weaker 
and, in some cases, gives place entirely to other and more 
fundamental forms of physiological activity. The fact is 
that we have in written symbols a new stage of abstraction 
which can be used in complex thought-processes in almost 
complete independence of sensory experiences. 
From written words turn to the signs used in mathemat- 
ical equations. How far we are from direct sensory experi- 
ence in the use of the symbol of equality or the symbol 
of addition! We can talk about adding things, using the 
word “addition” as the instrument for expression, and we 
shall recognize that we have reached a high stage of ab- 
straction ; but when we write the symbol for addition and, 
without any complete articulation or description, instantly 
recognize the fact that this symbol means the assembling 
into a single quantity of all the quantities that are on both 
sides of it, then we have isolated for purposes of thought, 
and dealt abstractly with, a process of mathematical manip- 
ulation. The purely abstract use of addition is, of course,
-P-A-G-E-113
NUMBER AND ABSTRACTION 103 
possible only after one has seen the process actually carried 
out with a number of concrete experiences. Thus the child 
must add seven splints to five splints or he must add five 
blocks to seven blocks before he will understand what is 
meant by the process of addition. Little by little he can be 
brought to the point where he does not need to think of 
the actual piling together of objects in order to understand 
what is meant by addition. Ultimately the child can think 
of the process of addition and its laws quite apart from 
any concrete examples, as when a trained adult recognizes 
without detailed thought that addition increases while 
subtraction diminishes. 
ALGEBRA AS AN ABSTRACT SCIENCE 
The science of algebra can be defined in terms of the 
foregoing discussion as a science which examines. math- 
ematical operations in a purely abstract way. We get as 
far away as we can from any real cases, and we study in 
the most abstract form how any case could be treated if we 
wanted to treat it from the point of view of the adding 
process, or the dividing process, or the subtracting process, 
ete. We study the different combinations of multiplication, 
permutation, etc., which are feasible, with all quantities of 
any kind whatsoever. Whenever we come upon a symbol 
of mathematical operation we have the real subject matter 
of this science before us. 
It is not enough, however, to have mere symbols of 
operation. There must be in every algebraic formula some- 
thing which stands for, and serves as a substitute for, the 
things which are to be added or otherwise manipulated. 
For the purposes of a general science which is studying the 
process of manipulation, it is desirable that the quantities 
which are to be handled should, as far as possible, leave 
behind all of their particular characteristics. We do not 
 
-P-A-G-E-114
  104 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
want to know what kind of things are to be added. We 
merely want to know what will happen to anything if it 
is added to something else. We consequently set down in 
our algebraic formulas the most abstract symbols of quan- 
tity which we can find, taking great pains that the symbols 
which we use shall have as little concrete significance as 
possible. We have, as a matter of fact, found it advantageous 
to use for this purpose the letters of the alphabet. The 
letters taken singly have no meaning whatsoever, and con- 
sequently they serve admirably the purpose in hand. We 
cannot use numbers, because numbers are expressions of a 
definite kind of fact, namely, exact position in the number 
series. It would be fatal to our study of the addition 
process, as such, if we used particular numbers. To be sure, 
numbers represent a high stage of abstraction, but they 
are nevertheless particular quantities in the sense that a 
given number means a perfectly definite relationship. On 
the other hand, if we use the letter a instead of a number, 
we have freed ourselves from any particular experiences, 
even the experience of a particular relation. It would not 
do to use a symbol which had even so much concrete sig- 
nificance as a word. Suppose, for example, that one should 
say in algebra that books added to books equal a library. 
Here we should have our attention concentrated upon books, 
and we could not study the addition process apart from 
the concrete objects which are to be added. Letters as 
contrasted with numbers and words represent no particular 
content. We might use symbols other than letters. We 
might use triangles and squares. The difficulty here is 
that if we try to use triangles and squares, we are in danger 
of forgetting that we do not mean triangles and squares. 
Forms are too interesting in themselves. We might use 
such a form as that of a triangle, stipulating that it repre- 
sents any sort of a quantity, but there would still be the 
lingering impression that this triangle can represent only
-P-A-G-E-115
    NUMBER AND ABSTRACTION 105 
other triangles. The association of space with space is 
too vivid to make the triangle available as an absolutely 
general symbol. 
When a set of symbols has been stripped of all concrete 
content we find that attention can be concentrated wholly 
upon processes or operations. Furthermore, we find that 
when we have learned the laws of mathematical operation 
we can come back to real situations with greater economy 
of mental energy than we could effect if we held all along 
to the concrete facts. In other words, if our reasoning is 
correct, it is possible to come back to real quantities with 
full assurance that in so far as the conclusion depends on 
rearrangement it is entirely reliable, without carrying the 
real quantities through all the operations. Thus, if I have 
a real set of facts, such as income and expenditure, and 
wish to find out how the combination of income and ex- 
penditure will work out if I add at this point and subtract 
at another, I can turn my items at the beginning of the 
discussion into abstract form by substituting letters for the 
particular items. I can now carry these letters through all 
the various processes of combination and recombination 
without thinking in detail about income and expenditure 
as real concrete experiences. I merely think about the proc- 
esses of combination and recombination. That is, I can 
say to myself that if I add a to 6 and 6 to ¢, the result 
for my next operation will be thus and so; I can carry on 
my second and third operations, using the letters all the 
time as substitutes for all real facts, and can after a long 
train of reasoning, in which I have been concerned only 
with combinations and recombinations, find myself in pos- 
session of a result which now can be translated back into 
the real facts. If I have taken a, }, and ¢ as three quan- 
tities and have worked them over until I find that I am 
left with 2a+4b—4e, I can instantly translate these 
symbols back into real quantities, with the assurance that 
 
-P-A-G-E-116
  106 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
all my manipulations have yielded a perfectly definite re- 
sult. By turning quantities into abstract symbols at the 
outset, I have avoided all the clumsiness of reference to 
particular quantities. I have concentrated attention upon 
the processes in which I am interested, and have there- 
fore economized enormously my mental energy; indeed, 
since my rules of procedure are reliable I have insured 
even greater correctness of thought than would have been 
possible if I had carried the concrete experiences along in 
full, for my thought-processes have been reduced to the 
last possible stage of simplicity. 
ADVANTAGES OF NEGLECTING THE CONCRETE 
Algebra thus shows itself to be, as is all abstract thought, 
a most economical mental device. Once we acquire the 
power to neglect all the concrete facts and to concentrate 
our attention wholly upon the processes of manipulation, 
we are free from the incumbrances that come through at- 
tention to the concrete facts. Not only so, but there are 
certain additional advantages which can be gained from 
carrying on thought at this abstract level. We can repre- 
sent to ourselves certain quantities which could not, as a 
matter of fact, be known in the concrete. Thus the student 
of algebra can represent the quantity which he wishes to 
secure by a letter such as z, and although it is for the time 
being an unknown quantity, he can include it in all his 
reasoning about operations. By including the unknown 
result in one’s reasoning, one gets all of the advantages 
of having the quantity for purposes of manipulation even 
when he could not include it as a real quantity, because it 
is not known. The use of a quantity before one knows it 
is possible only when the student becomes so familiar with 
the laws of algebraic manipulation that he is perfectly 
sure that he is treating all quantities properly without any
-P-A-G-E-117
  NUMBER AND ABSTRACTION 107 
reference whatsoever to their real character. Another and 
perhaps a more striking example is the use of imaginary 
quantities in algebra. Here the quantity is a pure abstrac- 
tion developed by the processes of mathematical manipula- 
tion, and useful as a means of carrying these processes far 
enough to permit them to reach completion. 
CoNTRAST BETWEEN ALGEBRA AND ARITHMETIC 
These discussions show the enormous advantage which 
is gained by dealing abstractly with situations. If a stu- 
dent can be made aware of the fact that algebra is an 
economy of time and energy, he is likely to get on very 
much better in his use of symbols and in his appreciation 
of their meaning than if he is simply led to think of the 
algebraic processes as processes of the same type as those 
which he used in arithmetic. Arithmetic is a particular 
science; algebra is a general science. Arithmetic is limited 
by the fact that the use of numbers always requires atten- 
tion to the number characteristics of each integer which is 
employed. We cannot use unknown quantities in arith- 
metic, simply because we have not gone far enough in the 
process of abstraction in arithmetic to get rid of the partic- 
ular qualities which are connected with particular numbers. 
In arithmetic it sometimes takes a long series of operations 
to work out an example which a very short series of proc- 
esses will work out in algebra. It is not proper, therefore, 
to speak of algebra as a chapter of arithmetic. Algebra 
takes up the processes and operations which are known to 
arithmetic in a form which is unknown to arithmetic. Stu- 
dents always have difficulty in seeing the connection be- 
tween arithmetic and algebra. If there is to be a relating 
of the two sciences of arithmetic and algebra, the teacher 
must see to it that the relation is worked out explicitly for 
the student.

RELATIONS OF ALGEBRA 
Algebra has other relations than the relation to arith- 
metic. Conspicuous, and important for our study, is the 
relation of algebra to geometry. For the practical teacher 
the relation of algebra to applications in industry and sci- 
ence is of equal importance. These special relations deserve 
full consideration, and will be taken up in a separate chap- 
ter. For the present we shall be content with the account 
which has been given of the number idea and the process 
of abstraction seen in algebra, and shall turn to a brief 
study of algebra texts. 
CoMPARISON OF ALGEBRA TEXTBOOKS 
The analysis of algebra which has been presented in the 
foregoing pages can be applied to some of the particular 
problems of teaching this subject by contrasting two text- 
books— one from the middle of the last century,! before the 
present-day high-school curriculum had developed, and one 
from the present period, during which every high-school 
subject is being carefully revised. 
SIMILARITY OF ToPICS TREATED 
The order of subjects in these two treatises is surprisingly 
alike. Indeed, the authors of the later book point out that 
they have followed the traditional order of treatment of 
topics. The fact that the traditional order of treatment has 
been maintained, in spite of the most careful revisions, indi- 
cates how completely the situation, up to this time, has

been dominated by the logical structure of the science. 
The newer book differs from the old book, however, in the 
fact that there are interspersed, throughout the text, chap- 
ters on the equation. In these chapters the abstract proc- 
esses are directly applied to the solution of problems. Thus, 
in the new book, after a chapter on the process of addition, 
there is a chapter on simple equations. In the older book 
equations were not taken up until all of the processes of 
addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division had been 
explained. Indeed, in the older book not only were these 
processes explained and exemplified with integers, but they 
were also applied to fractions before the student was brought 
to the use of the processes in the solution of equations 
and problems. There can be no doubt that the more recent 
book has, in its free use of problems and equations, furnished 
the student with a means of developing his ideas of the 
fundamental processes. To go through half a book on a 
subject with nothing but abstract examples of the processes 
that are to be used later is a great tax upon the interest 
and attention of the student. The change which has been 
introduced is undoubtedly of value in building up and 
maintaining the student’s insight and interest. 
EmpHASIS ON SPACE MATERIAL IN THE NEWER Book 
In the second place, the modern book contains certain 
topics which are entirely absent from the earlier book. There 
are a number of chapters in the new book on graphic meth- 
ods and on equations that deal with space and its different 
relations. This emphasis upon space is in the interest of 
application of the science of algebra and also in the interest of 
clearness of presentation of the various algebraic processes 
studied. The student gets an idea from seeing a graphic 
representation of an equation which he never could get in 
the same vivid way if the matter were discussed wholly in
-P-A-G-E-120
  110 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
abstract terms. This disposition to show the student con- 
crete facts related to algebraic equations is one of the most 
important innovations that has been made in the presenta- 
tion of mathematical sciences to secondary-school students. 
Algebra is remote from the ordinary subjects of real ex- 
perience; consequently, the discovery that space is at the 
same time a direct concrete experience and a means of 
expressing abstract relations is important to the teacher 
who is looking for some kind of experience which can 
always be used in explaining and applying algebra. Space 
is such material. In the older book there is very little ref- 
erence to geometrical facts. To be sure, in dealing with 
negative quantities one finds spatial facts in the older book. 
There are examples about distances to the north and 
south which illustrate the fact that the direction in which 
one moves is quite as important as the distance through 
which he passes; but in the newer book this geometrical 
fact is used not merely in examples, it is used as the best 
and most direct means of explaining the meaning of posi- 
tive and negative quantities. The principles of algebraic 
subtraction and addition are expounded in the newer book 
in terms of the straight line along which the student may 
move in two directions and along which he may pass from 
zero to positive or negative quantities. The exposition of 
the matter in the new book is vivid and definite, whereas 
in the old book the exposition was very abstract. The 
reader will not overlook in this connection the fact that 
space is well suited to this relation with algebraic processes 
because of its own character. 
Many Examples AND EXPLANATIONS 
A third characteristic of the new book as contrasted with 
the older book is the appearance of more exercises for the 
student to work out. Furthermore, these exercises begin in
-P-A-G-E-121
  NUMBER AND ABSTRACTION 111 
each section with very simple examples, many of which are 
drawn directly from arithmetic. In this respect the two 
books agree; but the larger number of exercises makes it 
possible to develop gradually the transition through which 
the student must pass from simple number statements to the 
abstract statements of the higher, algebraical type. In the 
older book this transition is often abrupt, leaving the stu- 
dent in the dark as to the motive for giving up the number 
for the literal expression. 
The newer book indicates a tendency to recognize the 
needs of the student, in that it expounds somewhat more 
fully the different processes. through which the student is 
passed. Thus, when a new paragraph is introduced, the text 
itself shows the student why he should take the steps that 
are described in the rule which is to be presented. This 
elaborate effort to explain the processes to the student 
helps him to guide himself. The book becomes more and 
more useful as a teacher. The work of the classroom is also 
facilitated by the fact that more of the fundamental expla- 
nations can be comprehended by the student in private study. 
SIGNIFICANT OMISSIONS IN THE NEWER Book 
Finally, the newer book omits some of the more elaborate 
topics which were contained in the older book. Indeed, the 
tendency of algebras in recent years has been to eliminate 
those topics which are useful merely for the student of the 
theoretical processes. For example, there is no attention to 
equations with many unknown quantities, and there is little 
or no attention to powers above the cube. The extracting 
of roots for higher powers is omitted. Doubtless the prac- 
tice of teachers who used the older book was much of the 
same type as that now followed in the more recent book. 
The fact that a subject was included in the older textbooks 
does not necessarily indicate that it was actually dealt with
-P-A-G-E-122
112 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
in class exercises. There can, however, be no doubt, even 
after deducting somewhat from the formidable character 
of the older course, that the modern course in algebra has 
been materially simplified. 
ARITHMETIC AND ALGEBRA 
Some further considerations are suggested by the items 
in the preface of the later book. The authors write (p. iii), 
“Constant reference has been made to arithmetic in explain- 
ing the various algebraic processes.” The student is often 
more confused than helped by reference to arithmetic. The 
reason for this is explained in an earlier paragraph, where 
the analysis of the mental processes involved in the two 
subjects led to the conclusion that the distinction between 
arithmetic and algebra is quite as important to impress 
upon the student as the relation between the two. We 
find that the necessity has been recognized from time to 
time of pointing out the distinction between the arithmeti- 
cal processes and the algebraic processes. For example, 
on page 4 there is evidently an effort to help the student 
to understand the value of the abstract symbols. He is told 
that symbols enable one “ to abbreviate ordinary language.” 
Furthermore, he is led gradually to see that symbols can 
be even more general and abstract than those which are 
used in arithmetic, but this last statement is not as explicit 
as it might be made. 
Indeed, as one reads books on algebra he wonders that 
mathematicians have not taken more complete advantage of 
the possibility of distinguishing sharply for the student be- 
tween arithmetic and algebra. If algebra is nothing but the 
last chapter of arithmetic, as the student would naturally 
assume from many of the statements which are made in the 
text, why was algebra not introduced in the arithmetic 
books themselves ? There is some tendency to take algebra
-P-A-G-E-123
NUMBER AND ABSTRACTION 113 
down into the elementary classes. If this tendency is to 
grow, would it not be well to point out explicitly to stu- 
dents the economy of this mode of treating mathematical 
operations? The distinction between algebra and arith- 
metic is quite as significant to the elementary student as it 
is to the mature student of the subject, and this distinction 
may advantageously be brought out. For example, on page 
7 in the book in hand the statement is made, “In algebra 
numbers are represented by one or more numerals or let- 
ters or by both combined.” Would it not be better at such a 
point as this to indicate that not only numbers but whole 
series of numbers are expressed by the letters? In the 
next paragraph, for example, it is said: 
Precisely what numbers 4ay and 22+ 3 represent is not 
known until the numbers for which x and y stand are known. 
In one problem these symbols may have values quite different 
from those they have in another. To devise methods of deter- 
mining these values in the various problems which arise is the 
principal aim of algebra. 
This is the opportunity to tell the student that the chief 
business of algebra is to avoid determining from step to 
step the exact values of these different symbols. It is the 
business of this science to carry on the reasoning processes 
with the symbols in the most general form possible. The 
final discovery of a particular quantity is of less interest 
to the science of algebra than the correct manipulation of 
quantities in processes which may ultimately lead to results, 
but are capable of study long before the result is obtained. 
To describe the processes of algebra as though they were 
similar to those of arithmetic is to confuse the student. 
He gets the impression that the use of letters is another 
refinement of the teacher’s methods of giving him unneces- 
sary problems to solve. It would be much more psychologi- 
cal and helpful for the teacher to let the student understand
-P-A-G-E-124
114 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
that he is now acquiring a new and more general mode of ma- 
nipulating quantities. As he studies the science of algebra he 
must aim to criticize processes and results not from the point 
of view merely of the ends which are to be obtained, but also 
from the point of view of the methods which he adopts at 
every step. 
APPLICATIONS 
One further comment in the preface of the newer book 
is of interest: 
Some informational problems have been included, but wholly 
with the intention of stimulating interest and not with the 
idea that such problems are practical, or that they arise in 
everyday life, or that it is the function of algebra to teach 
history, geography, or other subjects. 
This tendency to include in the problems facts of ordinary 
experience appears also in the older books. There evidently 
has been all along some desire to make algebra seem to the 
student to have connection with concrete life. The artifi- 
ciality of many of these problems is, however, very strik- 
ing. For example, on page 38 we get such an example as 
this: “The combined horse power of a Mallet Compound 
freight engine (Erie Railroad), of a Pacific passenger en- 
gine (Pennsylvania Railroad), and of a Baltimore and Ohio 
electric tractor,” and so on. Imagine the student trying 
to get from this kind of a problem any inspiration for his 
science. There is very little wonder that writers on mathe- 
matics find themselves in difficulty with problems of appli- 
cation when this sort of thing is developed in the minds of 
teachers as a means of showing students the interesting side 
of the science. The student knows perfectly well that these 
three engines will never get together for purposes of real co- 
operation. He knows that the use of these different names 
is merely a device to make him readjust the problem in
-P-A-G-E-125
NUMBER AND ABSTRACTION 115 
algebraic terms. He will have to convert engine No. 1 
into letter a and engine No. 2 into letter 4, and so on, be- 
fore he can go through the ordinary algebraic processes. 
This translation from one set of terms into another is, on the 
whole, good training for the student who has to use the 
abstract terms, but he cannot help feeling the artificial 
character of the original statement which is supposed to be 
nearer to practical life than the letters which he employs. 
The situation is bad because there are materials which are 
capable of employment in algebra borrowed directly from 
the sciences and so real and significant that they avoid all 
the artificiality of examples like the one just cited. The 
trouble is that algebra is usually taught at a time in the 
high school when examples from the sciences cannot be 
readily borrowed. In this connection note that our authors 
make this statement (p. iv): 
A large number of “motion” problems are given which, with 
many problems based on physical ideas and physical formu- 
las, should give much desirable correlation with the subject of 
physics. A very large number of problems are based on geo- 
metrical ideas, and as the needs of geometry largely decided 
the choice of the exercises in radicals, it is hoped that a close 
correlation of algebra with geometry has been secured. 
Why should not material of this sort, which is perfectly 
natural and legitimate, be used to the exclusion of the arti- 
ficial problems that have really no connection with either 
science or life? If necessary, let us precede the algebra 
problems by an explanation of these phenomena which can 
be adequately dealt with by algebraic methods. It may 
prove to be wise for us to develop some simple notion of 
mechanics in the first years of the high school and postpone 
algebra to a later period. In an earlier historical introduc- 
tion ‘to this discussion the reasons have been suggested why 
a postponement of algebra would, on the whole, be very 
legitimate. In any case space is evidently from now on to 
 
-P-A-G-E-126
  116 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
be used, even if algebra stays in the first year; the device 
which the modern author has adopted, of introducing graphs 
as a part of the algebra course, will help to cure in a 
measure the abstractness of the algebra course. 
OBSERVATIONS IN AN ALGEBRA CLASS 
Before attempting any discussion of the conclusions to 
be drawn from our studies, let us turn to a brief study 
of students and their work in class. Observations made on 
students who are attempting to solve problems in algebra 
always make the layman wonder what the writers on math- 
ematics mean by the repeated assertion that algebra is easier 
than geometry. Probably the assertion is correct when 
some of the simpler formulas of algebra are compared with 
the later propositions in geometry, but such a comparison 
is obviously without value. Certainly when one comes to 
the more complex problems in algebra, there is so much of 
a demand upon the powers of abstraction, and so much con- 
fusion which can arise from the many steps which need to 
be taken in solving a problem, that one understands very 
readily why students fail in this course. 
GREAT VARIETY OF MENTAL PROCESSES OBSERVED 
For the purpose of getting material that should parallel 
the observations made in the class in geometry, the writer 
attended a class in which the students were factoring and 
using the methods of factoring to solve equations. At the 
beginning of the class they factored some compound frac- 
tions and reduced them to simpler forms; toward the end 
of the class they factored certain equations and found the 
roots of the equations. In all these cases it was evident 
that the solution of the single problem involved a number of 
different operations, and the successive operations involved
-P-A-G-E-127
  NUMBER AND ABSTRACTION 117 
references to many principles of mathematical manipulation 
which the student had to use correctly or he was in trouble 
later. Thus, in clearing a compound fraction he must first 
discover a common denominator for the fractional elements. 
Second, he must multiply each fraction by the factor which 
would reduce it to the common denominator. This involved 
a knowledge of all the principles of division and multipli- 
cation, including the correct manipulation of signs. 
ABSENCE OF CONCRETE CHECKS 
Furthermore, each step is an abstract step; that is, it is 
not guided by any observable starting point or any refer- 
ence to a conclusion which can be seen and anticipated. 
This characteristic of algebraic operations may be made 
more obvious by contrasting algebra with geometry. When 
one is solving a problem in geometry he knows that he is 
working with triangles or with rectangles and he can con- 
stantly come back in the development of his reasoning to 
the concrete space figure with which he is dealing. In alge- 
bra, on the other hand, the successive stages of the process 
are not referred back to any concrete experience; the second 
step leaves the first behind, having substituted for the first 
situation a relatively new set of facts. In like manner the 
third stage leaves the second behind. The whole reasoning 
process is thus carried on without any concrete point of 
reference. Sometimes, in order to meet this situation, the 
instructor calls upon the students to write out each step 
completely. The advantage of writing out each step is 
evidently this: it makes it easier for the student to see 
his way through the succession of processes. He can com- 
pare the result which he has reached at the end of the first 
step with the requirements, and then he can proceed to the 
second step with some degree of assurance. This writing 
out of each individual step is, however, very cumbersome ;
-P-A-G-E-128
  118 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
and instructor and students alike realize the possibility of 
curtailing the work by carrying on some of these processes 
in the mind, rather than working them out completely and 
recording them on the blackboard or paper. On the other 
hand, if one of these steps is performed mentally, there is 
grave danger that the result obtained will not be reliable for 
the next stage of reasoning. Every algebra class furnishes 
abundant illustrations of the uncertainty of a conclusion 
which is reached through a series of unrecorded mental 
operations. There is, therefore, a constant conflict between 
certainty and precision of procedure, on the one hand, and 
rapidity and economy of effort, on the other. 
In the second place, a process of reasoning may be cor- 
rect in itself, but may not help in reaching the final solu- 
tion, because it leads in the wrong direction. For example, 
if one is rearranging an algebraical quantity for the pur- 
poses of factoring, he may rearrange it in such a way that 
he cannot easily extricate himself from the new form in 
which he has cast his expression. He may get his quanti- 
ties on the wrong side of the equation in such a way that 
it will not be easy to factor them; or he may get all of his 
quantities on one side of the equation where their negative 
charactér will confuse, whereas if he had assembled them 
on the other side of the equation, the proper quantities would 
have been positive. Very frequently there is a single addi- 
tional operation (if one thinks of it) which will extricate 
him from these difficulties, but more often one must turn 
back and begin over. Oneisrequired, therefore, to look ahead 
as intelligently as he can. He must take the step which he is 
taking at the present moment with a view to following it 
up by a second and third productive step later. This con- 
stant effort to anticipate the consequences of one’s reason- 
ing requires a range of attention which is not required in 
the geometrical processes in the same degree, or if it is 
required in the geometrical process, it is always supported
-P-A-G-E-129
  NUMBER AND ABSTRACTION 119 
by a much more concrete view of the end toward which 
one is working. One knows in geometry something about 
the theorem which he has to demonstrate. He does not 
know in the same concrete way in a problem in algebra 
the conclusion toward which he is working. There is there- 
fore at the moment no immediate check which will guide 
him in arranging his quantities. 
CONFUSION ARISING FROM ABSENCE OF CHECKS 
This last statement helps us to appreciate what is meant 
by students when they say that they do not know what to 
do next. They can do something that would be entirely 
correct, but they feel very sure that correctness is not all 
that is wanted. What they do not know is how to proceed 
in such a way as to aid themselves in reaching a solution 
of the problem. There is an element ‘of guesswork in the 
solution of an algebra problem which is very confusing to 
a student, especially if he is carried forward in the course 
too rapidly. This type of confusion is so common in algebra 
that it explains many of the failures in this subject. How 
an instructor knows, or how some other member of the class 
knows, just how to proceed is a mystery to the student 
who is not able to see far enough ahead to determine how 
he ought to proceed. Factoring, for example, is all right as 
soon as one gets the quantities put together in a recogniz- 
able form, but the ingenuity which textbooks and instructors 
seem to be able to exhibit in putting quantities together in 
such a way that they will not be recognizable as familiar 
quantities for factoring is baffling to the ordinary student. 
It would be interesting for some teacher of the subject who 
is also interested in the mental processes of his students to 
try to enumerate the different ways in which students may 
be right in the single operations which they perform, and 
yet wrong in their solution of the problem as a whole.
-P-A-G-E-130
    120 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
In addition to the possibilities described in the last para- 
graph of going astray in the manipulations, there are infinite 
possibilities of actual error. One forgets how to remove 
a parenthesis or how to transpose quantities, or, through 
carelessness, omits to apply the principle which he knows 
well enough in theory. The teacher of algebra is constantly 
working, therefore, to keep alive and in operation a long 
list of principles of operation which students are constantly 
omitting. The omission means an error, and an error means 
failure to reach a solution. 
EXAMPLES OF TyPICAL DIFFICULTIES 
The observations made in a single period exemplified all 
of the difficulties described above. Perhaps the most vivid 
presentation of the observations will result from an enumer- 
ation of errors ; that is, of the principles that were omitted or 
violated. The list would probably be longer if the writer 
had been more expert in this type of observation. He 
noted, however, the following cases. The students often 
failed to keep in mind a long series of principles necessary 
to guide in manipulating the signs of different quantities. 
They forgot that a negative sign before a parenthesis works 
certain changes in the quantity within the parenthesis. 
They lost sight of the effect produced upon signs by trans- 
position from one side of the equation to the other. An- 
other type of error arose from a failure to keep in mind the 
processes which control the different combinations of quan- 
tities. They made repeated mistakes in addition, subtraction, 
multiplication, and division. Again, they did not see the 
various familiar combinations which make it possible to get 
rid of undesirable quantities on both sides of the equation. 
They did not always remember that the management of the 
two sides of an equation or of the two members of a frac- 
tional expression calls for a like treatment of both of the
-P-A-G-E-131
  NUMBER AND ABSTRACTION 121 
elements in the operation. They committed an error of 
omission in that they did not show the boldness to try 
experiments in the rearrangement of quantities. They were 
not patient enough to work out this rearrangement until 
they could see ahead a method of getting a conclusion. 
Their hesitation was evidently due in some cases to a rec- 
ognition of the fact that if they eliminated some of the 
quantities they might lose just the one needed to turn their 
factors into the familiar factors needed for later manipula- 
tion. They frequently made the error of trying to economize 
by carrying on processes mentally when the more deliberate 
written statement of the same problem showed that they 
knew the principle of procedure. 
METHOD MUST BE ADAPTED TO PARTICULAR 
DIFFICULTIES 
Perhaps some reader of the foregoing paragraph will ask, 
What is the use of laboriously cataloguing all these different 
types of error? They are all alike, in that they show inability 
to solve the problem. Give the erring student more exam- 
ples; that is the one and only cure for all these difficulties. 
Our answer to such a comment is that the cure is not one 
and simple. The student of algebra is often lost in the maze 
of complexities. At each turn he is confronted by a single 
difficulty. His difficulties need to be disentangled, and one 
by one the kinds of processes which he needs must be 
picked out and definitely dealt with. If some teacher of 
algebra would make out a card catalogue of the kinds of 
mental processes involved in the solution of all algebra 
problems, and would then arrange his subject matter to 
meet these difficulties, he would probably break away from 
the traditional order of that subject more than any of the 
textbooks have ventured even in the latest period. He 
would also give to the subject an educational character 
 
-P-A-G-E-132
122 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
which it does not now have. At present we let students 
flounder in a sea of mental difficulties until some learn to 
swim and many drown. We tell them from time to time 
when they are going down, and sometimes we rescue them 
when we see them sinking, but we have little advice for 
them in regard to the best methods of swimming. Our 
algebra instruction is on the whole a crude exhibition of 
the method of “try, try again,” when it ought to be the 
most completely supervised of any of the subjects, espe- 
cially if it is to continue to hold its place as a subject 
commonly required.

CHAPTER VI 
THE REORGANIZATION OF MATHEMATICS 
REORGANIZATION EVIDENTLY UNDER WAY 
In a vigorous paper Superintendent Morrison! has re- 
cently advocated the complete rearrangement of high-school 
mathematics. Algebra and geometry, he contends, must be 
taught (if at all) so as to function throughout the student’s 
life. If the student is especially interested in commerce, 
his mathematics must be so organized as to contribute to his 
practical training. If the student is pursuing agriculture, his 
mathematics are to be of a type which shall serve that interest. 
Other evidences are not wanting that high-school math- 
ematics are approaching a period of radical revision. There 
is evidence which, from the point of view of the school 
administrator, is of a very practical type. Statistics show 
that in the more progressive high schools algebra is reced- 
ing to a position of less importance than it formerly held.? 
The colleges are requiring less mathematics than ever for 
admission ; and the individual student who fails is becom- 
ing more insistent than ever that he be allowed to go on 
with other subjects. 
SUPERVISED Stupy 
In the meantime, two experiments are under way which 
promise relief, and to these we turn for their contribution 
to our psychology.

eation, pp. 9-31. University of Chicago Press.

123
-P-A-G-E-134
124 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
The first experiment is in the direction of more super- 
vision of study by the teacher.! Students are not being sent 
home with problems to solve; they are working out the 
problems in class with the teacher. The mistakes which 
they make are being checked through social criticism. 
The value of social criticism as an instrument in educa- 
tion cannot be exaggerated. To be sure, there is something 
artificial from the point of view of the science itself in 
interposing between a student and the solution of his 
problem criticism by another person. For example, when 
the teacher says, “Be careful, have you removed that paren- 
thesis correctly ?” the scientific training of the student has 
been so far forth interrupted that a human check has been 
substituted for a check of the strictly algebraic type. If 
the child becomes dependent on social help in the solution 
of all his problems, the substitution of social training for 
independent learning may become a serious drawback. On 
the other hand, learning through proper supervision is eco- 
nomical and rapid beyond all other methods. 
Psychologically, social interference in mental processes 
is of various types. There is social interference which 
terrorizes and distracts. There is social interference which 
aids one over a difficulty without clearing up the difficulty. 
There is social interference which teaches deliberation. 
There is social interference which makes for economy in 
mental operations by pointing out methods of procedure. 
In short, there is a whole psychology of the relation between 
student and teacher. This is not the point at which this 
particular psychological problem can be discussed at length ; 
but it is germane to the present discussion to note that the 
right kind of supervision or social codperation cannot be 
expected unless teachers study the problem of how students 
study, and how they ought to study. We shall come back

  THE REORGANIZATION OF MATHEMATICS 125 
to a fuller discussion of methods of study in a later chapter 
devoted entirely to this problem. The student needs help 
in algebra more than in most subjects, because the mental 
processes involved in this study are so abstract and com- 
plex that it is extremely difficult to find one’s way without 
much guidance. 
One reciprocal advantage of such a system of supervised 
study is that the teacher discovers the details of students’ 
mental processes more fully than under the usual conditions 
of recitation work. Errors are corrected before they become 
chronic, and the waste that follows upon confusion is avoided. 
SmitH on APPLIED AND COMBINED MATHEMATICS 
A second type of reorganization reaches into the subject 
itself and undertakes to reorganize the matter dealt with 
in these courses. Of the various internal reforms within - 
the mathematics courses there are two which have gone far 
enough to attract adverse criticism. We may therefore 
quote at length the passages in which these matters are 
discussed by Professor Smith. 
[P. 74] And as to the exercises, what is the basis of selec- 
tion ? In general, let it be said that any exercise that pretends 
to be real should be so, and that words taken from science or 
measurements do not necessarily make the problem genuine. 
To take a proposition and apply it in a manner that the world 
never sanctions is to indulge in deceit. On the other hand, 
wholly to neglect the common applications of geometry to hand- 
work of various kinds is to miss one of our great opportunities to 
make the subject vital to the pupil, to arouse new interest, and 
to give a meaning to it that is otherwise wanting. It should 
always be remembered that mental discipline, whatever the 
phrase may mean, can as readily be obtained from a genuine 
application of a theorem as from a mere geometric puzzle. On 
the other hand, it is evident that not more than 25 per cent of 
propositions have any genuine applications outside of geometry,

and that if we are to attempt any applications at all, these 
must be sought mainly in the field of pure geometry. In the 
exercises, therefore, we seek to-day a sane and a balanced book, 
giving equal weight to theory and to practice, to the demands 
of the artisan and to those of the mathematician, to the appli- 
cations of concrete science and to those of pure geometry, thus 
making a fusion of pure and applied mathematics, with the 
latter as prominent as the supply of genuine problems permits. 
[Pp. 84, 85] From the standpoint of theory there is or 
need be no relation whatever between algebra and geometry. 
Algebra was originally the science of the equation, as its name 
indicates. This means that it was the science of finding the 
value of an unknown quantity in a statement of equality. 
Later it came to mean much more than this, and Newton spoke 
of it as universal arithmetic, and wrote an algebra with this 
title. At present the term is applied to the elements of a 
science in which numbers are represented by letters and in 
which certain functions are studied, functions which it is not 
necessary to specify at this time. The work relates chiefly to 
functions involving the idea of number. In geometry, on the 
other hand, the work relates chiefly to form. Indeed, in pure 
geometry number plays practically no part, while in pure 
algebra form plays practically no part. 
In 1637 the great French philosopher, Descartes, wishing to 
picture certain algebraic functions, wrote a work of about a 
hundred pages, entitled “ La Géométrie,” and in this he showed 
a correspondence between the numbers of algebra (which may 
be expressed by letters) and the concepts of geometry. This 
was the first great step in the analytic geometry that finally 
gave us the graph in algebra. Since then there have been 
brought out from time to time other analogies between algebra 
and geometry, always to the advantage of each science. This 
has led to a desire on the part of some teachers to unite algebra 
and geometry into one science, having simply a class in 
mathematics without these special names. 
It is well to consider the advantages and the disadvantages 
of such a plan, and to decide as to the rational attitude to be 
taken by teachers concerning the question at issue.
-P-A-G-E-137
  THE REORGANIZATION OF MATHEMATICS 127 
[Pp. 89-90, 91] It is therefore probable that simple mensura- 
tion will continue, as a part of arithmetic, to precede algebra, 
as at present; and that algebra into or through quadratics will 
precede geometry, drawing upon the mensuration of arithmetic 
as may be needed; and that geometry will follow this part of 
algebra, using its principles as far as possible to assist in the 
demonstrations and to express and manipulate its formulas. 
Plane geometry, or else a year of plane and solid geometry, 
will probably, in this country, be followed by algebra, com- 
pleting quadratics and studying progressions; and by solid 
geometry, or a supplementary course in plane and solid geom- 
etry, this work being elective in many, if not all, schools. 
It is also probable that a general review of mathematics, where 
the fusion idea may be carried out, will prove to be a feature 
of the last year of the high school, and one that will grow in 
popularity as time goes on. Such a plan will keep algebra and 
geometry separate, but it will allow each to use all of the other 
that has preceded it, and will encourage every effort in this 
direction. It will accomplish all that a more complete fusion 
really hopes to accomplish, and it will give encouragement to 
all who seek to modernize the spirit of each of these great 
branches of mathematics. 
There is, however, a chance for fusion in two classes of 
school, neither of which is as yet well developed in this 
country. The first is the technical high school that is at 
present coming into some prominence. It is not probable even 
here that the best results can be secured by eliminating all 
mathematics save only what is applicable in the shop, but if 
this view should prevail for a time, there would be so little left 
of either algebra or geometry that each could readily be joined 
to the other. The actual amount of algebra needed by a fore- 
man in a machine shop can be taught in about four lessons, 
and the geometry or mensuration that he needs can be taught 
in eight lessons at the most. The necessary trigonometry may 
take eight more, so that it is entirely feasible to unite these 
three subjects. The boy who takes such a course would know 
as much about mathematics as a child who had read ten pages 
in a primer would know about literature, but he would have 
 
-P-A-G-E-138
128 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
enough for his immediate needs, even though he had no appre- 
ciation of mathematics as a science. If any one asks if this is 
not all that the school should give him, it might be well to ask 
if the school should give only the ability to read, without the 
knowledge of any good literature; if it should give only the 
ability to sing, without the knowledge of good music; if it 
should give only the ability to speak, without any training in 
the use of good language; and if it should give a knowledge of 
home geography, without any intimation that the world is 
round—an atom in the unfathomable universe about us. 
The second opportunity for fusion is possibly (for it is by 
no means certain) to be found in a type of school in which the 
only required courses are the initial ones. These schools have 
some strong advocates, it being claimed that every pupil should 
be introduced to the large branches of knowledge and then 
allowed to elect the ones in which he finds himself the most 
interested. Whether or not this is sound educational policy 
need not be discussed at this time; but if such a plan were 
developed, it might be well to offer a somewhat superficial (in 
the sense of abridged) course that should embody a little of 
algebra, a little of geometry, and a little of trigonometry. This 
would unconsciously become a bait for students, and the result 
would probably be some good teaching in the class in question. 
It is to be hoped that we may have some strong, well-considered 
textbooks upon this phase of the work. 
THE ForEGoInG ARGUMENT ANSWERS ITSELF 
Are we not in a position to recast the geometry of the 
Greeks and the algebra of the Arabs into an instrument of 
modern intellectual training ? May we not urge this change 
the more freely when we have come to recognize the impor- 
tance of both algebra and geometry and the contribution 
which each is ready to make to intellectual life? The very 
fact that we have taken both into our circle of subjects to be 
taught shows that we are better off than was Euclid, or the 
early European teachers who started our present tradition.
-P-A-G-E-139
  THE REORGANIZATION OF MATHEMATICS 129 
Various BRANCHES OF MATHEMATICS INVOLVE FUNDA- 
MENTALLY DIFFERENT MENTAL PROCESSES 
The psychologist is of course not equipped to work out 
the change. He may, however, venture to suggest certain 
principles which will have to be taken into account when 
the change is made. The first of these principles is that 
arithmetic, algebra, and geometry each represents some 
forms of mental activity not included in the others. No one 
can make a psychological analysis of these sciences without 
recognizing the distinctive character of the mental processes 
involved. The earlier chapters of this book have been de- 
voted to the description of the mental processes peculiar 
to geometry and algebra. The principle has not been justi- 
fied in full for arithmetic because arithmetic does not fall 
within the scope of this book ; however, considerations were 
presented which adequately cover even arithmetic. 
ALL MATHEMATICS ABSTRACT 
Second, all mathematical sciences represent abstract forms 
of thought. Number is an abstraction derived from, but not 
identical with, the system of tallies from which it originated. 
Space, as treated in geometry, is something other than the 
space system which we build up through touch and vision. 
The line which is studied in geometry is an abstraction and 
belongs in an abstract scheme of thought; so is the surface 
and solid. Algebra is evidently a system of abstractions. 
As a system of abstractions mathematics can never be 
identified with its applications. The justification for a sys- 
tem of abstract thought is that it evades some of the com- 
plexities of real concrete situations and furnishes a means 
of thinking one’s way through the real world with greater 
economy. The system of abstraction deserves, therefore, 
some treatment for its own sake.
-P-A-G-E-140
180 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
TRAINING IN APPLICATION REQUIRED 
Third, it is contrary to experience to assume that stu- 
dents can apply mathematics to the other sciences or to 
the practical affairs of life unless they are trained to see 
mathematical relations in other forms than those in which 
they are commonly presented in the schools. The student 
who knows the abstract demonstrations of geometry, but 
does not realize that knowledge of space is involved in 
every manufacturing operation, in every adjustment of 
agriculture and practical mechanics, is only half trained. 
Application must be a phase, and an explicit phase, of 
school work. Application is as different from pure science 
as pure sciences are different from each other. 
Space TypicAL Form oF RELATIONAL EXPERIENCE 
Fourth, the direct perceptual experience which is most 
closely related to all types of mathematical thought is 
space. Space, because of its character as a relational type 
of experience, is not only itself a natural subject of mathe- 
matical consideration, but is also capable of representing 
in graphic form those mathematical relations which are 
usually represented in letters and numbers. Space is 
therefore strongly suggested as an instrument for both the 
exemplification and the expression of mathematical ideas. 
Furthermore, by virtue of the intimate relation of space 
perception to mechanics, space seems to be a good instru- 
ment for the training of students in application of mathe- 
matics. While thus emphasizing the significance of space 
for mathematics, it is proper once more to emphasize the 
historical fact that in our Western civilization the science 
of space is prior to all other phases of mathematics. It is 
altogether probable that this fact will shortly be recognized 
in the elementary course.

THE REORGANIZATION OF MATHEMATICS 131 
MATHEMATICAL SuBJECT MATTER IN NEED OF 
REGRADING 
Fifth, both algebra and geometry contain simple and 
complex principles. There is no reason why the simpler 
principles of both branches of mathematics should not be 
recognized as more suitable for beginning students than 
an exclusive diet of either algebra or geometry. The con- 
clusion that one or the other is harder or easier when the 
two subjects are taken as wholes is unfortunate. The expe- 
rience of schools does not justify the statements of special- 
ists that algebra is easier than geometry. The fact is that 
some parts of one are hard for beginners and other parts 
are simple. The best arrangement of subjects would be to 
bring together all the simpler mathematical principles and 
lead up from these to the complex problems in both fields. 
MATHEMATICS AS TRAINING IN MODES OF ABSTRACTION 
Sixth, no student will know what mathematics is until 
he realizes the great economy of mental energy which this 
form of experience makes possible. The student of high- 
school age should certainly be taught the value of abstrac- 
tion, as well as the methods of abstract reasoning. 
PracticAL IMPLICATIONS OF GENERAL PRINCIPLES 
These principles, all of which grow directly out of the 
discussions of the foregoing chapters, seem to the writer to 
call loudly for a first-year course in high-school mathematics 
which shall lay emphasis on space, shall include application 
ut not become so absorbed in applications as to obscure the 
principles of abstract reasoning, shall include the simpler 
principles of both algebra and geometry, and shall train the 
student in an appreciation of the value of symbols. 
   
-P-A-G-E-142
    132 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
If this book were intended for teachers in the elementary 
schools, it would advocate a course in form study early in 
the grades, and it would advocate the use below the high 
school of some of the economical methods of mathematical 
reasoning taught by algebra. 
The only one of these conclusions which has not been 
fully supported in the foregoing pages is that referring 
to applications. The issues here involved are too broad to be 
dealt with in terms of mathematics alone. Every course in 
the curriculum raises the same kind of problem. We shall 
therefore let this question rest for the moment, with the 
promise that the psychology of applications will come up 
again. These early chapters on mathematics have carried 
enough of the general burden of introducing the reader 
to the problems of high-school education. We shall turn, 
therefore, to the next general topic on which psychology 
is prepared to speak, namely, the psychology of language.
-P-A-G-E-143
CHAPTER VII 
THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LANGUAGE 
SECONDARY COURSE TRADITIONALLY LITERARY 
The secondary-school curriculum has throughout its his- 
tory been dominated by language courses. Whether these 
courses have been given for the sake of acquainting the 
student with foreign literatures, as in the period of the 
Renaissance, or for purely disciplinary reasons as during 
the later period when the cultivation of a Latin style was 
thought to be the highest form of training; whether the 
training has been in a foreign language as in earlier days, or 
largely in the vernacular as at the present time — language 
has, in one form or another, been the favored course of study 
in all secondary and higher schools. If one considers the 
merely quantitative fact that at the present time about 
36 per cent of the courses offered in the secondary schools 
are courses either in the study of the vernacular or in the 
study of a foreign language,! he recognizes the importance of 
sound views with regard to this phase of secondary educa- 
tion. Indeed, it may be said that the proper organization of 
language courses is, if possible, a problem even more urgent 
than the problem of organizing algebra and geometry. The 
practical difficulty arising from student failures is not as 
great in the language courses as in mathematics. In some 
quarters, to be sure, Latin shares with mathematics the 
doubtful honor of being the course through which freshmen _ 
are eliminated from school. The characteristic difficulty 
1 Unpublished study of North Central Association reports from 
approved high schools. 
133 
 
-P-A-G-E-144
184 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
that appears in language instruction is the difficulty which 
arises from the fact that students spend an enormous amount 
of time on these courses and carry away what is acknowl- 
edged to be a very meager result. An American high-school 
graduate who can really read Latin is a very rare product. 
In the modern languages students study the courses for 
two or three years and are not able to read a simple text 
or understand a simple conversation. Even in the vernac- 
ular the complaint is heard again and again from English 
teachers that students who have been studying English 
all their lives are unable to write a coherent paragraph or 
to understand even the best-known examples of English 
classical literature. The net outcome of the time and en- 
ergy devoted to language is hardly to be compared with 
the net outcome which is demanded of students in science 
courses. If students should study the natural sciences for 
two or three years and at the end of the course have nothing 
substantial to offer as the outcome of their endeavor, cer- 
tainly the natural sciences would not be able to maintain 
themselves in the curriculum. When, accordingly, one hears 
a teacher of German or French contending that two years 
is too short a time to accomplish anything for a student in 
that language, he realizes the necessity of canvassing care- 
fully the language courses. Certain it is that many students 
will not be able to spend more than two years on German; | 
and if the course is not organized at the present time in such | 
a way that these two years will yield a useful result, then 
there ought to be a reorganization of the course.   
JUSTIFICATION DEMANDED FOR EMPHASIS ON ENGLISH 
In classifying English and foreign languages together for 
the purposes of the following discussion some confusion 
is undoubtedly created, because in general the instruction 
which is offered in foreign languages is different in its
-P-A-G-E-145
  THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LANGUAGE 185 
character and in its purposes from instruction offered in 
English. On the other hand, there can be no doubt that 
the large amount of attention which is being given at the 
present time to English is to be explained as a survival of 
the traditional devotion to the language subjects. English 
has, in the present period of reaction against the classics, 
enjoyed the advantage of being acceptable to both parties 
in the classical controversy. English has been acceptable 
to the defenders of classical training because they think 
of English as a body of literary material, and regard it 
as proper to use in defense of English most of the argu- 
ments which they have developed in defending their own 
subjects. On the other hand, the students of science are 
also interested in seeing English receive a good deal of 
attention because they believe that it represents a depar- 
ture from the classical traditions and from the devotion 
to formal instruction in foreign languages. English has 
therefore gone on its way undisputed. It has come to 
be the only subject in the secondary-school curriculum 
which is recognized by everyone as a suitable subject to be 
required of all students. Signs are not lacking that a day of 
reckoning will come for English also. When the teachers? 
of this subject themselves are prepared to criticize it as 
severely as they do, there is danger that representatives of 
other departments will discover its weaknesses. Just as soon 
as the weaknesses of present-day English courses are clearly 
pointed out, there will inevitably come a demand for a justi- 
fication of the large amount of attention which these courses 
now receive. The classical languages have for some years 
past been on the defensive. The modern languages have 
been growing in importance, and yet they also are being 
questioned by those who are interested in the possibilities 
of developing a scientific and technical curriculum ; so that

186 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
on all sides the language subjects will have to canvass care- 
fully the question of the amount of time which they can 
legitimately demand, and they will have to supply an educa- 
tional defense for themselves much more critical and com- 
plete than anything which has been supplied up to this time 
either by tradition or by the concrete evidences of success 
which have attended instruction in these subjects. 
THE GENERAL PsycHOLOGY oF LANGUAGE 
As in our earlier studies of mathematics, so here we may 
very properly introduce the consideration of detailed prob- 
lems by a review of the contributions which psychology has 
to make. This is the more needed because there is in the 
minds of most uncritical thinkers a great deal of false doc- 
trine about the mental processes connected with words and 
their interpretation. Indeed, it is only during the last fifteen 
years, since Wundt’s work in his “ Vélkerpsychologie” be- 
gan to be widely appreciated, that anything like an adequate 
psychological treatment of language has been current. 
EAruieR PsycHOLOGY EMPHASIZED IMAGES 
The earlier descriptions of the mental processes involved 
in the use of language all started and ended with the 
assumption that words get their meanings by association 
with images in the speaker’s mind or in the mind of the 
1 Wilhelm Wundt, Vélkerpsychologie. Engelmann, Leipzig, 1900. 
Unfortunately there is no English translation of this great work. Read- 
ers who do not command German are referred to the following brief 
discussions in English: Wundt, Outlines of Psychology (translation 
published by Engelmann. Only the third English edition is complete); 
G. F. Stout, Manual of Psychology (Hinds and Noble); G. F. Stout, 
Groundwork of Psychology (Hinds and Noble); Charles H. Judd, Psychol- 
ogy, General Introduction. It is the more important that teachers should 
become acquainted with these summaries, since the educational writings 
of recent years have curiously omitted discussions of language, so 
absorbed have they been in sensations, instincts, emotions, and the like,
-P-A-G-E-147
THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LANGUAGE 137 
listener.1 When one hears a word, we have been told, he 
calls up a train of pictures, and these are the really im- 
portant mental facts. The word is a mere clue, a kind of 
key to the storehouse of meanings. There has been at all 
stages of the discussion a very large disregard, almost a 
contempt, for the word as distinguished from the associated 
image. Indeed, the word has been so much neglected that 
one obvious fact has been overlooked in most of the dis- 
cussions. This obvious fact is that speech in all of its 
manifold forms is more than a mere train of ideas; it is a 
definite and important kind of behavior. There is a move- 
ment of some muscles of the body present in every form of 
speech and reading. If one articulates a word, there is a 
most elaborate codrdination of the muscles of respiration, 
of the vocal-cord region, and of the mouth. If one reads, 
there are eye movements and incipient movements of the 
muscles of articulation. If one listens, there are adjust- 
ments of the head and ears, and active vocal tendencies to 
repeat what one hears, and active forms of inner reactions 
of assent and dissent. Even if it were true that words 
always call up images, it is infinitely more true that words 
are forms of behavior, and their value in individual life 
can be understood only when this behavior-aspect of the 
matter is duly considered. Furthermore, there is ample 
ground in personal experience for skepticism about the 
statement often made that words call up trains of pictures. 
The few faint images which flit through the mind as one 
reads a page of meaningful discussion are by no means the 
important facts in mental life which some psychologies have 
tried to make them. When one looks into his own mind 
he finds wealth of meaning and meagerness of imagery. 
When a false psychology tries to persuade the observer 
1 Locke’s *tAn Essay concerning Human Understanding ”’ (1689-1690) 
set the example of English writers in this respect. See also Berkeley’s 
“A Treatise concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge,” 1710. 
  \
-P-A-G-E-148
    188 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
that the images pass through the mind too rapidly to be 
noted, he has a right to ask for a more vital and adequate 
explanation of this most important form of experience. 
LANGUAGE A Form oF BEHAVIOR 
There is one other aspect of the matter which calls for 
comment before we turn to the study of words as forms 
of behavior. Up to this time the breach between words 
and practical activities has been complete. The teacher of 
manual training has scorned words, and the teacher of Eng- 
lish has looked down on shop work. These mutual antipa- 
thies grow out of a vagueness with regard to the character 
of the mental processes connected with words and with 
manual activities. If we are ever to adjust the so-called 
academic subjects and the technical subjects, we must be 
perfectly clear that shop work and Latin are both forms 
of behavior. What is the nature of one form of behavior, 
what the nature of the other? These are questions which 
must be answered, in order to give to each subject its proper 
place and its proper relations. 
Language as a form of behavior must be studied in con- 
nection with other forms of behavior and with reference 
to its development. We may, therefore, at the outset call 
attention to the fact that everyone, throughout his waking 
life, is intensely active. The muscles of the body are always 
tense. This tension of the muscles is due to the fact that 
the stream of sensory energy which goes in at the eyes and 
ears pours out into all the muscles of the body and main- 
tains a general bodily tension or muscular tonus. When 
a special impression comes to the senses and arouses a par- 
ticular set of muscles, a single definite contraction, as, for 
example, a contraction of the muscles of the arm, rises 
above the general bodily tension, and the arm moves 
through space. The ordinary observer is likely to overlook
-P-A-G-E-149
eo ee ee eee 
THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LANGUAGE 139 
the fact that the body was active before the arm moved. 
He will see the matter in a new light, however, if he thinks 
how much work is done all the time in holding up the 
body or the head during waking hours. If the muscles of 
the neck relax for a moment the head falls forward. The 
muscles of the body are likewise active all the time; and 
the particular movements of which we think when the term 
“activity” is ordinarily used are mere special cases of a 
general muscular tension. 
RELATION OF LANGUAGE TO EMOTIONS 
Corresponding to the general tension of the muscles, there 
is a general excitement throughout the nervous system; and 
corresponding to this general excitement throughout the 
nervous system, there is a general tonus of mental life. We 
often speak of this as the emotional tone of consciousness. 
The man who starts out at the beginning of the day with 
buoyant spirits and head erect exemplifies the relation 
between bodily tonus and mental tonus. 
The relation between mental life and bodily activity is 
also well illustrated by the infant. The infant’s conscious- 
ness can best be described by saying that it is a mass of 
vague mental tensions. Some of these mental tensions reach 
a high level of intensity and stand out from the general 
body of vague, massive experiences. So it is also with the 
infant’s behavior. The infant moves with all the parts of 
his body irregularly and diffusely. He exhibits infinite 
possibilities of behavior and unorganized tendencies of 
action. The business of experience is to develop out of 
these vague, general possibilities specific forms of reaction. 
With the development of specific bodily movements will 
come specific mental processes. 
Among the earliest phases of indefinite reaction on the 
part of the infant are the reactions of the vocal muscles. 
 
-P-A-G-E-150
140 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
These vocal muscles, like the muscles of the arms and legs, 
contract at the beginning of life whenever there is a general 
excitement of the nervous system. Such excitement some- 
times grows intense, as in the case of emotional reactions. 
The screaming infant is always a kicking and a striking 
infant. He does not scream for purposes of communication. 
Indeed, he does not have any appreciation of the world 
about him. His experience is all internal, personal, and 
emotional in type. Very shortly, however, certain forms of 
personal behavior begin to take on a unique value. The in- 
fant finds that some of his forms of behavior produce effects 
on those about him. Furthermore, he begins to note in those 
about him forms of activity which he can imitate. Certain 
forms of behavior come thus in a social group to have a value 
which they do not possess in individual experience. This 
fact can be illustrated by an example borrowed from adult 
life. When we are afraid we feel many internal contractions 
which we have not learned to control. On the other hand, we 
control our facial expression because we do not want to show 
to our fellows just how frightened we are. Facial expres- 
sions are easily observable, and we know it; hence our effort 
to suppress them. Our internal reactions and our private 
emotions we enjoy without interruption because no one can 
see them. So it is with the infant: certain of his external, 
visible reactions begin to stand forth in his experience as 
having a unique social value. He cultivates a social con- 
sciousness through a recognition of the effects of his acts. 
SocraAL IMITATION INFLUENCES EVOLUTION OF 
BEHAVIOR 
Perhaps it will be well to study the growth of social con- 
sciousness in connection with forms of activity other than 
speech. To this end let us consider more in detail facial 
expressions. In the first place, the person who exhibits
-P-A-G-E-151
THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LANGUAGE 141 
the facial expression becomes aware of the fact that he 
is likely to induce imitation in others; and, in the second 
place, the person who sees the contraction of the facial 
muscles is aware of the fact that he is drawn into sympathy 
with one of his fellows. The person who exhibits the ex- 
pression will therefore try to modify it if he does not wish 
to be imitated, or he may, on the other hand, try to exagger- 
ate the expression if he wishes to be imitated. Conversely, 
the person who sees the expression will either try to 
suppress his own tendencies toward imitation or become 
absorbed in these tendencies. A simple example of social 
imitation is seen when a group of people imitate each other 
in yawning. The activity is in this case a very simple 
physiological reaction, and yet, because it is so easy to 
imitate, it takes on a strong social character. 
If we study natural reactions we discover a whole series 
of graded steps of imitation and tendencies to take on 
social significance. For example, the angry man who shakes 
his fist in the face of his neighbor is very likely to induce 
an equally vigorous imitative response. Imitation here is 
more compelling than in the case of a yawn. A serious 
mood, with its accompanying expressions, will induce a like 
attitude in others. Here the external symptoms are many 
and complex. A spirit of optimism or pessimism is socially 
contagious because the person possessed of such a spirit is 
violently expressive. In all these cases, be it noted, we are 
dealing with social values which are more fundamental and, 
in a sense, more simple than speech. 
Imitation reaches far beyond the muscular act itself. 
It not only brings the social group into harmonious action, 
but it also makes it possible for one individual to induce 
indirectly in his neighbor an inner state of mind. Thus, 
if by shaking one’s fist in the face of his neighbor one can 
stir up an imitative act, he is likely also to communicate 
his anger to the person in whom he induces imitation. 
 
-P-A-G-E-152
142 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
Two consciousnesses are thus brought together through 
an external act which was originally attached only to the 
consciousness of one person. 
SELECTION OF ForMS or BEHAVIOR FOR SOCIAL 
CoMMUNICATION 
Once this possibility of communicating from mind to 
mind through external behavior becomes obvious in a social 
group, there is sure to be a rapid development of a general 
system of communications. The evolution of a system of 
communications will naturally emphasize that form of be- 
havior which is at once easy to observe and easy to control. 
If there is some form of activity which impresses one’s 
neighbor but which one cannot himself control, it is not 
likely that one will depend on this uncontrollable system 
of activity for purposes of social intercourse. A moment 
ago we referred to facial expressions as one of the avenues 
of social communication. Evidently, however, facial ex- 
pression is not the best medium for influencing one’s 
neighbor, because one is himself not aware of the way. 
in which his facial muscles contract. In order to have the 
largest possible control of one’s own acts, one must be 
able himself to observe his acts. We see, therefore, that 
the tendency in any social group will early be in the di- 
rection of emphasizing such activities as those of the hand 
rather than those of the face. 
GESTURES A PRIMITIVE ForM oF LANGUAGE 
One of the earlier forms of language is gesture language. 
When one makes a gesture he can see what he is doing, 
and he can also induce imitation on the part of the per- 
son with whom he is trying to communicate. Through 
social development the gesture, which was at first a purely
-P-A-G-E-153
THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LANGUAGE 143 
personal reaction, has passed into the sphere of elaborately 
meaningful acts. 
For example, if the traveler on the plains wishes to 
express to a stranger whom he meets the fact that he is 
thirsty or hungry, he is able to do so readily by the use of 
gestures which point to his mouth and indicate that he wishes 
to have something to put into his mouth. The gesture in this 
case is undoubtedly accompanied by some degree of emo- 
tional excitement, but the gesture is more than an emotional 
expression — it is a means of communicating an idea. The 
gesture is a part of the total behavior which the individual 
would go through if he really wanted food. In this sense it 
requires no special training either to produce it or to under- 
stand it. Gestures have accordingly been called natural signs. 
CONVENTIONALIZED GESTURES 
Gestures come to be, in the course of repeated use, rela- 
tively much simpler than they were at the outset. Thus 
two individuals who have frequently communicated with 
each other can, by some familiar gesture which is a mere 
remnant of an earlier, more elaborate movement, arouse in 
each other’s minds ideas which are definite and significant. 
This simplification of gestures appears in the study of deaf 
mutes and others who depend entirely upon gestures in com- 
municating with each other. Gestures become simpler and 
simpler because the interpretation which the various mem- 
bers of the social group are able to give to them becomes 
more and more trained. Finally, the gesture is so far sim- 
plified that it is no longer anatural sign. It is significant in 
its simplified form merely because it starts a train of asso- 
ciations in a mind especially prepared by past experience 
to respond to the suggestion. At this stage the gesture is 
to be described as a convention; that is, several persons 
have come to use it for a common purpose long enough to
-P-A-G-E-154
144 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
establish a like interpretation for each of the members of the 
trained group. A stranger who comes into the company is 
not able to use the gestures as do the members of the trained 
group, because in the stranger’s mind there is no fixed rela- 
tion between the simplified movement and its appropriate 
interpretation. The term “convention,” as above used, is 
not to be understood to indicate that there has been any 
deliberate arrangement or agreement on the part of the 
members of the group; they simply came to use the gesture 
in this common way through their contact with each other. 
There is no conscious agreement to develop a system of 
signs; there is merely a natural development of the mem- 
bers of the group in the same direction until finally their 
expressions are naturally simplified. 
SELECTION OF THE VOCAL Corps AS INSTRUMENTS 
° OF EXPRESSION 
Up to this time we have used examples of expressions 
and conventional activities which do not involve the vocal 
cords. This discussion of other forms of movement shows 
us how closely the evolution of vocal language has followed 
natural lines. We turn now to a brief consideration of the 
reasons why the vocal cords have come to occupy the posi- 
tion of preéminent importance which they hold in human 
life. We have in the vocal cords an organ of the highest 
degree of flexibility. The movements of the muscles which 
control the cords are more delicate than the movements of 
the hand or of most parts of the body. At the same time 
these movements produce, through the sense of hearing, a 
series of sensations which can be recognized by both the 
speaker and the auditor. There results thus, through the 
sense of hearing, the most advantageous control of the motor 
organs. Furthermore, the sensory experience which is pro- 
duced by the vocal cords is not dependent upon external
-P-A-G-E-155
  THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LANGUAGE 145 
conditions, except that there must be air through which the 
sound can be transmitted. As long as there is air enough 
for a human being to breathe, there will also be a medium 
for the transmission of sounds. In this respect the vocal 
cords are very much less dependent upon external condi- 
tions than are gestures. One cannot use gestures after 
dark, because the withdrawal of the light makes it impos- 
sible for the person addressed to see. On the other hand, 
the speaker can produce a noise even if he is in the dark. 
The external conditions do not limit him in producing 
noises, as they would limit him if he tried to communicate 
through the visual sense. 
Finally, the vocal cords rather than the hands are selected 
as the instruments of social communication, because the 
hands are needed for other purposes. The hands in the 
course of human experience have come to be specialized as 
the organs for technical activities. We learn the arts and 
engage in them with the hands. We cannot spare the 
hands for purposes of social communication. Indeed, in 
many cases the chief importance of social communication is 
that it aids workers to cooperate with their hands, as in 
moving a heavy object. While the hands are too useful to 
be given over to communication, the vocal cords are use- 
less as technical instruments. We cannot do anything in 
the physical world with our vocal cords. We cannot move 
objects about with the vocal muscles, and we cannot manip- 
ulate tools with them. The vocal organs are adapted to a 
single type of behavior, namely, social communication. 
EvoLution or VocAL EXPRESSIONS 
Once the vocal cords have been selected, and the general 
fact that a sound can be used as a medium of social com- 
munication has become obvious to a social group, there will 
appear a tendency similar to that which was pointed out in 
 
-P-A-G-E-156
146 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
connection with gestures. The sound will begin to take on 
meanings which are dependent more upon the training of 
the speaker and the auditor than upon the natural relations 
of the sound. For example, if we take one of the natural 
sounds produced by an animal and think of it as imitated 
by the human vocal cords, as when a child says “ bowwow,” 
there will undoubtedly be a natural relationship in the 
mind of both the speaker and the auditor between this par- 
ticular sound and the animal which it represents. Gradu- 
ally, however, the social group will be freed from the 
necessity of producing the complete natural sound in this 
case. A partial sound which grows out of the more elabo- 
rate natural sound will be entirely adequate to arouse the 
idea. The principle of association operates here, and the 
simplification of the expression goes on exactly as it did in 
the case of gestures. Furthermore, there are many cases in 
which there are no sounds produced by the objects to be 
designated. In such cases the naturalness of the sound will 
arise from the fact that a human being, in the presence of 
a certain object, tends to make a certain noise. It is often 
difficult to show why a particular noise is natural. In some 
cases the articulation is undoubtedly natural in the sense 
that one tends to make a loud noise in the presence of a 
large object, while one tends, on the other hand, to make a 
faint or shrill noise in the presence of small objects. One 
notes, for example, that his method of talking to a little 
child or a little animal is always different from his method 
of addressing an adult or a large animal. One tends to 
speak in a high, shrill tone when he speaks to a cat; 
whereas he never uses this pitch when speaking to a horse. 
The naturalness of the sound in this case is not dependent 
at all upon the sound which is produced by the animal 
itself. We discover here that behavior derives its natural- 
ness from the human speaker rather than from the object 
named. Max Miiller expressed this fact when he said that
-P-A-G-E-157
  
  THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LANGUAGE 147 
if you strike a human being you will get a characteristic 
sound exactly as you do when you strike a bell. The crit- 
ics of Max Miiller’s theory call this the “dingdong” theory of 
the development of language. They regarded the theory as 
fantastic, but there can be no doubt that Miiller expressed 
a fundamental truth. 
In the beginnings of language there were many situations 
in which vocal reactions were perfectly natural and, at the 
same time, distinctive because of the character of the sit- 
uation in which the articulation was produced. If now a 
social group has repeatedly heard a sound produced in the 
presence of a certain object or situation, there naturally 
develops a tendency for the sound and the ideas to get 
themselves so definitely connected that whenever the object 
or situation is presented this particular sound will be pro- 
duced. Conversely, whenever the sound is produced, the 
idea of that particular object or situation will arise in the 
mind. The question of the form in which such an associ- 
ation will develop is a problem to which we must return 
again. It is important to note, however, at this juncture, 
that what is associated with a partial sound is not merely a 
picture or image in the mind, but rather a whole attitude 
of reaction. When I utter the word “dog,” or hear the 
sound which comes from uttering that word, the partial 
or verbal reaction expands instantly into the general bodily 
attitude appropriate to the experience of seeing a dog. If I 
am afraid of dogs, the essential part of the experience will 
be a feeling of violent contraction of my internal muscles 
and a desire to run. If I am fond of dogs, I shall have a 
reaching out of all my muscles and a feeling of satisfaction. 
There may be, and often is, no image in the mind at all. 
The word is part of a system of behavior rather than part 
of a series of pictures. The experiences attached to words 
thus include as important elements the feeling attitudes 
appropriate to the object.

148 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
SPEECH AS CONVENTION 
In the course of development, sounds became more highly 
conventionalized than gestures. A newcomer in the social 
group which has many conventions has certain unique 
advantages and certain serious difficulties. He can acquire 
through imitation a whole system of expressions which the 
group developed very gradually, but he will have to take 
on many of the sounds without seeing anything natural in 
them. Thus the child who comes into a social group in pos- 
session of an English vocabulary will have little opportunity 
to exercise his inventive genius. He could doubtless make 
many natural sounds, but society has no time or patience 
to attend to his personal attempts. Society has its system, 
and the newcomer must learn the system. In the long run 
he will profit, for the system is more elaborate than anything 
he could invent, and it has subtle virtues which he does not 
always realize. His task is, however, a relatively artificial 
task. He must learn to control his vocal cords so that he can 
produce the great variety of sounds included in the lan- 
guage which he is trying to acquire, and he must learn most 
meanings as pure conventions. This latter is no simple task, 
and nature does not guide him. He will have to acquire 
meanings by any devices he can adopt, in order to bring 
himself into sympathetic contact with the ideas of his 
elders. Learning a language is, therefore, a very different 
process from helping to construct a language in a social 
group without established conventions. 
CoNVENTION HIGHLY ADVANTAGEOUS 
Critics of educational methods and results have often had 
occasion to emphasize the unnaturalness of words and the 
dangers that the intellectual life of the student encounters 
when he is introduced to words as the chief instruments of
-P-A-G-E-159
  THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LANGUAGE 149 
his training. It may be well, therefore, at the very begin- 
ning of the study to point out the great advantages of an 
elaborate scheme of communication, even if that scheme 
is highly conventional. One thinks of the primitive savage 
who succeeded in communicating his emotions and a few of 
his simple concrete ideas to his fellows, and realizes that the 
moment this possibility of communication was developed, 
there grew up an intimate relationship between the mem- 
bers of the communicating group which made for social 
coéperation and social solidarity of the utmost importance. 
A tribe that had developed this means of communication 
was no longer made up of individuals relatively independ- 
ent of each other. Rather, it was made up of a group closely 
bound together and able to codperate with each other in the 
most efficient way. The larger and more powerful the social 
group became, the more important became the means of 
communication, the more dependent the individual found 
himself to be upon his social environment, and the more 
eager he was to cultivate the fullest possibility of social 
expression. Language came, therefore, to be an instrument 
of social union, and social union changed the character of 
individual effort and individual interest. It would be hard 
to exaggerate the importance of language among the forms 
of primitive human activity. The industrial arts developed 
slowly, but even these depended for their fullest usefulness 
upon the compactness of the social group. When the hunter 
and the arrow maker began to divide their functions in such 
a way that the hunter carried on one part of society’s activi- 
ties, and the arrow maker, as a specialist, played an entirely 
different part, it was language that held them both to- 
gether in a single social organization. It was language 
which made it possible for them to exchange their prod- 
ucts, and to reach an agreement with regard to the future 
policies which should set each one at work in his own 
particular line with the complete assurance that this type     
                          
-P-A-G-E-160
    150 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
of codperation would be advantageous to himself and to 
his fellows. Man came to be, because of his use of language, 
an entirely different kind of a being from any of the ani- 
mals. Indeed, he began to live a kind of life which had 
never been evolved in the animal kingdom; and his devo- 
tion to language was merely the expression of the fact 
that he depended upon this instrument of social life in a 
very high degree for the maintenance of the general con- 
ditions under which he carried on all of his activities. The 
pursuit of a line of thought such as this will show the stu- 
dent of human nature the value of social conventions as 
distinguished from naturalness of expression. The individ- 
ual must give up something of his personal directness of 
reaction in order to become a part of the social whole, but 
the result is worth the cost. 
SprecH A DomINATING SysteM OF BEHAVIOR 
Little by little this one dominant mode of behavior began 
to draw into itself and associate with itself other forms of 
human activity. For example, primitive drawing originated 
in the beginning without any reference whatsoever to spoken 
language. Men drew pictures of objects, and through these 
pictures aroused in each other certain ideas. We have 
ample evidence that the earliest forms of picture-writing 
had no connection whatsoever with oral communication. 
In the course of time, however, just as gestures were sim- 
plified and gradually came to take on conventional meaning, 
so the pictures which are drawn by primitive men came to 
have conventional significance. There are evidences of this 
to-day in all of the conventional mythological figures which 
still survive as direct appeals to the visual imagination, in 
the totem pole of the Indian, and in the idol of the Oriental. 
These show that the pictures which men drew in the early — 
stages of social life began to have a significance for the
-P-A-G-E-161
ee ee ee re ae rr ere een Aue Ten 
‘ 
THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LANGUAGE 151 
group which they could not have had if there had not been 
a social group to use and interpret them. Certain of the 
pictures which primitive men drew were ultimately simpli- 
fied and brought into the closest relation to words. If one 
goes to China to-day, he finds that every word has its corre- 
sponding picture. The Chinese picture-words undoubtedly 
originated at first as independent creations; but as soon 
as it was found that a picture could be related to a word, 
the picture lost its character as an appeal to the visual 
imagination and became a part of the abstract system of 
language. The possibility of using pictures as permanent 
means of expression and as a means of expression over 
long distances, both of space and time, gave them an in- 
fluence on civilization which is in some respects superior 
to the influence exercised by oral expression. Oral expres- 
sion, while less permanent and therefore less significant 
as a means of establishing records, was, however, the con- 
trolling system of expression and determined the ideas 
which should be associated with the written symbol. The 
written symbol had to express first a word, and through 
this word the related ideas. Incidentally, this subordina- 
tion of drawing to oral expression is the strongest possible 
evidence that words are not psychologically dependent on 
visual images for their usefulness. Words are substitutes 
for pictures. 
The foregoing psychological sketch of the origin of the 
written alphabet should be supplemented by a perusal of 
some of the more complete accounts of this evolution.1

INFLUENCE OF WRITTEN ForMS ON SPEECH 
After the domination of picture-writing by articulation 
had been completely effected, the reflex influence of written 
language on oral speech became everywhere apparent. Oral 
speech has to-day elements of conservatism and fixity 
which can be explained only by recognizing the fact that 
we not only speak our words but also write them. In un- 
civilized tribes the modifications of sounds went forward 
very rapidly because men had no permanent record of the 
sounds which constituted their language. Since the inven- 
tion of printing — indeed, since the beginning of the use 
of writing — the permanent visual record has made it more 
and more difficult for dialects to break off from each other 
and for new signs and combinations to arise in oral speech. 
Other reflex influences of written speech have also shown 
themselves in the development of the history of language. 
The grammatical forms and the rhetorical principles which 
are operative in modern society are more governed to-day 
by written and printed language than by oral expression. 
The reflex influences of written speech upon oral lan- 
guage are nowhere more apparent than in the practices of 
our schools. Here we find ourselves in a sphere where 
written language has been so much emphasized that it has 
come to be the dominant instrument of instruction. When 
we wish to give the child an idea in our American schools 
we usually do it through the printed page rather than 
through the spoken word. When one thinks of the number 
of printed pages that a child reads in the course of his edu- 
cation, one realizes how important this mode of instruction 
has come to be in our civilization. Probably a child in 
school reads more words in a year than he hears or speaks 
in all the class exercises which he attends. He becomes, 
therefore, as we sometimes say vaguely in our general dis- 
cussions of school activities, eye-minded. He will begin to
-P-A-G-E-163
  
   THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LANGUAGE 153 
establish preferences for writing as a means of expressing 
his own ideas as over against oral speech. As a result, we 
find that ordinary school training has limited very greatly 
the powers of oral expression in most children. Many a 
child and many an adult finds himself able to work out an 
idea if he is given a pencil and paper, while he is very far 
from fluent in oral speech. 
SpreciAL ForMs or BEHAVIOR CONNECTED WITH 
WRITTEN LANGUAGE 
The special psychology of the reading and writing proc- 
esses includes, in addition to the foregoing discussion of the 
relation of writing to oral speech, a study of certain special 
forms of motor adjustments. We cannot enter into these 
details at this point. It is enough to call attention to the 
fact that there are special movements of the eyes which 
must be acquired by one who reads, and there are special 
movements of the hands and fingers which must be acquired 
by the child who is learning to write. Oral expression re- 
mains, however, the fundamental form of language expres- 
sion throughout education, as shown by the fact that there 
is a tendency to articulate even when one reads and writes. 
Oral expression is, however, reduced to its lowest terms in 
the course of development. The ordinary observer may 
hardly be aware of the remnant of vocalization present when 
he reads or writes. Careful observation will show him that 
such movements are present, and scientific studies have 
furnished abundant evidence that we never lose entirely 
the tendency to articulate. 
The problems of language instruction are thus multiplied 
as we recognize the various kinds of language activities 
which have arisen in modern society, and the complexities of 
behavior which appear in the forms of language conscious- 
ness cultivated in connection with reading and writing.

    154 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
Repvuction oF Bopity Activities To A MInImMuM 
Before we turn to the application of our studies of 
language, it is important that we should dwell upon the 
fact mentioned incidentally a moment ago. With the de- 
velopments of meanings in words there has been a gradual 
reduction of the motor processes that are involved. This 
reduction of movements appears not only in the processes 
that accompany recognition of words, but also, and perhaps 
more completely, in the motor processes that are involved in 
the interpretation of words. The simplification and reduc- 
tion of the interpreting reaction have gone so far in most 
cases that they eluded the earlier writers on psychology. 
Take such words as express anger, and study their effect 
on both speaker and listener. Such words arouse activities 
in the inner muscles of the body. I say to my neighbor 
that I will not tolerate so and so. We are both roused to 
a pitch of excitement that can be described only in terms 
of strong internal reaction. Other words are less exciting, 
but have this same relation to inner behavior; interpreta- 
tion of all words depends upon these internal attitudes. 
WorbDs As SUBSTITUTES FOR DiREcCT EXPERIENCES 
When one realizes that words are thus interpreted 
through direct association with bodily reactions, a problem 
of language consciousness which has long confused teachers 
is at once cleared up. Through its association with reac- 
tions the word becomes a substitute for external impres- 
sions and makes it possible for the speaker and listener to 
have a whole train of vivid experiences without calling up 
any images or having any objects whatsoever in mind. 
This statement can be illustrated as follows: When I seize 
an object I get at first an impression of that thing; if 
the impression is disagreeable, I react by pushing it away.
-P-A-G-E-165
  THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LANGUAGE 155 
The end of the whole process is the pushing away. Later, 
as I become acquainted with the thing, I push it away with- 
out examining it in detail; that is, without a complete 
impression of it. Finally, the merest suggestion that the 
thing is there will arouse the reaction. The reaction can 
now be detached from the thing and can be attached to 
some substitute for the thing. Thus the word “danger” 
sounded in my ear causes me to jump. The word “danger” 
is a substitute for an impression or an idea of a dangerous 
thing. The words“ rough” and “ smooth” arouse in me con- 
trasting experiences without any necessity of first handling 
some rough or smooth thing. The words have in all these 
cases taken meanings to themselves ; that is, they have taken 
on connection with interpreting forms of behavior. 
It is not alone in the sphere of emotional interpretation 
that words become independent of the experiences from 
which they first derived their meaning. Take for purposes 
of illustration such words. as “up” and “down.” These 
words were at first interpreted to us in childhood by some- 
one who pointed upward or looked upward when he used 
the word “up.” Sometimes the word was associated with 
the observation of a flight of stairs or a ladder. Ultimately 
all these experiences were condensed into a few faint ten- 
dencies to roll the eyes upward or downward, and the adult 
thus appreciates in an easy way, through a mere tendency 
to move, the meaning which the child had to learn through 
many experiences and much effort. Furthermore, the roll- 
ing upward of the eyes has, in the course of mental devel- 
opment, attached itself not only to tall things and high things 
but also to such matters as abstract values, as when we say 
that prices have gone up. Again, we say that a man’s career 
is downward. Words thus come to have a value of their 
own without going back to things for their interpretation. 
Furthermore, words have a value for mental life which 
they could never have if they merely called up images. 
 
-P-A-G-E-166
156 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
Worps INDEPENDENT OF PICTURES IN THE MIND 
Such a view of the psychology of words is in the most 
fundamental opposition to the view which teaches that 
words get their meanings by calling up pictures. That view 
thinks of a word as a clumsy device for reviving in the 
mind something more useful; namely, an image. That view 
is obviously disproved by all experience. It fails in the first 
place to explain that great host of words for which there 
could in the nature of the case be no images. Think of such 
a word as “appalling” or “inconvenient” and it will in- 
stantly be recognized that only in the most artificial way 
can such words be attached to pictures in the mind. But 
the doctrine of images fails at a second and, on the whole, 
much more crucial point. Words grew up at first as means 
of social intercourse, but once they had developed they 
proved to be of such value to individual thought that they 
have very largely taken the place of all the other means of 
individual thought. Even if images were the natural instru- 
ments of thought before words came, it is certain that now 
the greater part of the world’s thinking is done with words. 
Images would be too clumsy for the mind which has learned 
the use of words. A moment’s consideration of what has 
passed through the reader’s consciousness during the last 
few moments will convince him that he does not stop to 
develop pictures. The fact is that words take on a char- 
acter of their own. Contrasting words are immediately 
recognized as opposed. Related words are thought of as 
capable of combination. The psychological mechanism of 
interpretation can be understood in terms of tendencies 
toward reaction. When words contrast, one feels within 
himself opposing tendencies. When the word “ appalling” 
strikes the ear, one feels his muscular system respond with 
a cringing, expectant shock. When one hears the word 
“magnificent” he feels a muscular expansion long before
-P-A-G-E-167
THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LANGUAGE 157 
he is able by any exercise of imagination to place before 
his mind a picture of a magnificent object. 
A very instructive analysis of experiences connected with 
different words is given by Miss Rowland.1 We may there- 
fore quote at length from her work. 
Miss RowLAnv’s ANALYSIS OF MENTAL PROCESSES 
AROUSED BY WoRDS 
Miss Rowland presented to her subjects certain series of 
words such as the following: “entrance,” “ enter,” “in,” 
“inner”; “weight,” “lift,” “heavy,” “under,” and so on; 
and asked the subjects to observe carefully the moment at. 
which they understood the meaning of the word and the 
mental processes which passed through their minds during 
the apprehension of this meaning. In describing the results 
Miss Rowland says that her subjects noted three stages in 
the development of meaning. 
(1) A feeling of familiarity with the word, that she [the sub- 
ject] would know presently what it meant (this stage of word 
meaning has been called “ Implicit Apprehension ” by Stout, in 
his discussion of this matter in his “Analytic Psychology ”). 
(2) She then felt she would know how to use it, that is, the actual 
meaning came before (3) the images unrolled themselves in all 
their variety in the third stage. In other words, the images 
in the third stage seemed sometimes to stay the same for two 
words of allied meaning, whereas she felt at once there was a 
difference in their meaning or their use. Although visual im- 
ages were always present when she attempted to define meaning, 
they seemed arbitrary and not to express its essence. She had, 
so far as she could discriminate, exactly the same visual image 
for drink and for water, that is,a person drinking water in both 
cases, yet the difference in meaning was evident and remained 
1Eleanor H. Rowland, ‘tThe Psychological Experiences Connected 
with the Different Parts of Speech,’’? Monograph Supplement No. 32, 
of the Psychological Review, January, 1907.
-P-A-G-E-168
158 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
the same with all kinds of voluntary changes of the images. 
For this reason, she felt that the meaning came with the second 
stage. The sound of the word was familiar, and then she knew 
what it meant, that is, she had a peculiar feeling of knowing 
just what to do about it, whereas the images appropriate to 
the occasion (whether pictures, the word written, or what not), 
although present when she attended to them, seemed more or 
less arbitrary. Of course in a sense any idea or any feeling is 
an image, and one might contend that the feeling of knowing 
how to use words was a memory-image of former use or some- 
thing of the sort. But it seems to the writer that such a broad 
use of the word image, applying it to any possible mental state, 
simply vitiates its own particular significance. When image is 
used in this discussion it will refer to reproduced sensations 
whether of sight, hearing, touch, or any other; whereas feel- 
ings, attitude of like or dislike, tensions, etc., will be designated 
as such. The subject admitted that no definition could be given 
of the word without some visual or auditory images, some 
specialized associations. But she also insisted she felt what it 
meant before she could define it, even to herself, and that 
if she waited for images to elucidate the feeling, there was no 
determining where to stop. 
On page 5 Miss Rowland defines somewhat more fully, in 
the following statement, what is meant by one of the stages. 
EMPHASIS ON REACTIONS 
The feeling of word meaning is apparently composed of 
knowing how to react on it to some extent. This reaction is 
at its lowest stage when the ability to react is solely to write 
or speak it, or even to give some approximate imitation of it in 
tone or articulation. This knowledge of reaction varies in com- 
plexity. It may be only slight knowledge of the general nature 
of reaction, that is, it is an imperative to do something, although 
just what is not recognized. Or it may be a rich complex of 
varied and discriminating associations. This necessary reaction 
means physiologically that the sound of the word has brought 
a train of. associations with it and in going over into its 
centrifugal discharges, the number-and extent of open channels
-P-A-G-E-169
  THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LANGUAGE 159 
varies largely. If nothing is known of the meaning of the word, 
but it is articulated by the human voice, the feeling of famil- 
jarity or vague consciousness of meaning (when in truth it has 
no ulterior significance) is merely the general feeling of the 
organism which accompanies the opening of the channels appro- 
priate to reproducing the word by speech or writing. If the 
word was too complicated to be reproduced accurately, simply 
an approximate reproduction would be sufficient. There need 
be no actual felt tendency to reproduce, indeed no strain or 
sensation of any kind. But the very sensory stimulus of the 
sound must have some motor discharge before it can become 
a conscious state. The combined discharge of the associated 
auditory or written images which may be with it (more or less 
distinctly) gives a certain balance or set, to consciousness ; that: 
balance gives rise to its own peculiar feeling ; and that feeling is 
the skeleton of its so-called meaning. If on receiving the stimu- 
lus there was not even a reactive tendency to reproduce the 
word, the last vestige of its meaning as a word would be gone. 
Miss Rowland’s analysis of the different parts of speech 
shows that while the imagery for different words may be the 
same, the particular significance of the different parts of 
speech is brought out in the accessory feelings of reaction 
which characterize each. Without attempting to report in 
full her findings with regard to all of the different kinds of 
words, we may repeat her statement with regard to adjec- 
tives. Adjectives differ from nouns, in that the former are 
more likely to call up visual images. Even if one accepts 
the general theory, that a noun gets its full meaning through 
the association of the word with images, the adjective has a 
character which is to be defined as follows: 
SPECIAL MENTAL PROCESSES CONNECTED WITH 
ADJECTIVES 
Adjectives seem to be more intimate, more personal words 
than any yet given. Several phrases were used by the subject 
in explanation such as “ broader feeling than noun,” ‘“ seems 
to spread over the whole of me,” and ‘it was noticeable that
-P-A-G-E-170
160 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
almost invariably some feeling-tone was connected with the 
adjective. Although the adjectives were thought of as applying 
to something else, the meaning was felt in terms of their effect 
on the person. Thus, in all the phrases “sharp wind,” “sharp 
knife,” “sharp rebuke,” “sharp pain,” the abiding sense of 
sharp, although applied to different objects, meant a subjective 
cringe. The likeness of all these various nouns was solely in 
the fact that they produced the same kind of a shiver. The 
adjective state of mind is composed of a definite qualitative 
content. It involves no purposive action, no feeling of the self 
as agent and acting toward an end or of anything else doing 
so. It is concerned with subjective reaction regardless of what 
it acts on or any end to be accomplished. 
SENTENCES AS PsycHOLOGICAL Units 
Finally, one quotation may be made from Miss Rowland’s 
statement of the way in which words are used in sentences. 
The tendency in all higher word combinations is to tempo- 
rarily deprive the words of all associations that do not contrib- 
ute to the meaning of a sentence as a whole. The span of 
attention is limited, and if we had as complete a reaction as 
Ihave described for each word in a sentence, we should be lost 
in the meaning of the parts before we could combine them in 
a whole. We do not give equal value to the different parts of 
a sentence, but we dwell on the more important words, while 
those of lesser interest serve, not as independent words, but 
simply as parts of the associative cluster that makes up the 
meanings of the others. 
The meaning of a word in a sentence varies, and demands 
strictly a change in word-form to express this variation, as one 
or another of its associations or motor reactions is sacrificed 
for the more concise meaning of the sentence. 
The tendency of language development for practical and 
scientific purposes is all in the direction of economizing the 
separate word-reactions, for the sake of the meaning of the 
sentences as wholes. But in these cases, while we get more 
meaning from the sentence than we could from any separate  
-P-A-G-E-171
  THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LANGUAGE 161 
word, we are not getting as wide an individual meaning from 
any one word as if we heard it alone. The words limit each 
other, and by their very definiteness cut off the extent of their 
individual significance. 
SUGGESTIONS OF A PSYCHOLOGY OF A LITERARY STYLE 
The highest literary style consists of a nice adjustment of 
values, where the words mean all that they possibly can, with- 
out confusing the combined meaning of them all. On the other 
hand, scientific style of expression differs, in that the separate 
words are allowed only as much independent significance as is 
necessary for the sentence to have a meaning. This prevents 
any doubleness of interpretation, and more can be crowded into 
a single given space. In general, a phrase may become a kind of 
elongated word, and may have meanings in every way analogous 
to word-units as we have studied them. When these phrase- 
experiences are described, however, the analysis must fall into 
the same terms as we have used for the word-experiences. 
WorLp or WorDS 
The world of thought is enormously expanded by the 
creation and use of words. It is little wonder that man for 
long ages thought of himself as absolutely distinct from the 
rest of the animal kingdom. Man lives in a world of words; 
the animals live in a world of things and memories of 
things. To those who can use words so as to influence the 
rest of us we give society’s great rewards. To the combi- 
nations of ideas which have been worked out in words, we 
owe changes that have later been wrought out in things. 
In short, our civilization rests on words more than on things 
themselves, for our civilization differs from primitive, un- 
couth conditions chiefly because the economical methods 
of thought and action made possible by words have trans- 
formed our relation to the world and put at man’s disposal 
forces which could not have been discovered or mastered 
without the higher modes of abstract thought.

CHAPTER VIII 
THE ENGLISH PROBLEM 
INSTRUCTION IN THE VERNACULAR LATE 
The problem of finding the true place of English in the 
school course of study can be understood only by recalling 
the historical fact that in the beginning no one thought of 
the vernacular as a suitable subject for school training. It 
was assumed, and is, indeed, assumed to-day by many people 
that one can acquire his native tongue without any special 
education. Foreign languages, it was recognized from the 
beginning, must be taught by a teacher, and the subject 
matter which enters into science and history evidently re- 
quires to be taught before it can be mastered; but the use 
of common words and the formation of common sentences 
are assumed as a part of the informal training of the child 
through his home and through his everyday environment. 
We read in the history of education, therefore, how the 
vernacular was brought into the school by the special plea 
~sof Martin Luther and his successors as an innovation in 
the educational system. Up to the time of the Reformation 
the languages taught had all of them been the remote and 
unusual languages. . 
UNFAMILIAR ASPECTS OF LANGUAGE FIRST EMPHASIZED 
Coming down to the modern period we find something 
analogous to the movement which was inaugurated at the 
time of the Reformation. We find that the high school of a 
+>generation ago assumed that the student would get English 
162
-P-A-G-E-173
  THE ENGLISH PROBLEM 163 
incidentally as a part of the rest of his work. Up to that 
time the lower schools had indeed recognized the impor- 
tance of teaching reading. Like a foreign language, reading 
requires acquaintance with a set of symbols which do not 
confront the child in his ordinary home life or in his play 
on the street. The early New England school, founded 
explicitly as a reading school, was therefore a very natural 
concession to the demands of society for the special training 
of children; but the New England reading school was not 
a place where the child was trained in oral language. So 
also the high school of a generation ago was absorbed in a 
kind of training which emphasized very little the common 
use of the mother tongue. The high school put into the 
hands of its students many books which they were required 
to use, but there was little or no pretense at training chil- 
dren in modes of common speech or in the use of common 
forms of conversation. The only phase of the vernacular 
which was taught in these schools was formal grammar, 
that is, the structure of language. The upper grades of 
the elementary school usually went over grammar in great 
detail, but in some cases the course commenced in the high 
school. Grammar, as the science of language, was taught 
in imitation of the methods prevalent in teaching the classics, 
on the assumption that the student would know the words 
and sentences of the language before he began to take up 
the rules of parsing and grammatical agreement.) Still& 
later, when some training in the use of words was brought 
into the school as a substitute for pure grammar, it was 
found that written composition received the emphasis. It 
is even to-day assumed that the ordinary child can talk, but 
it is conceded that he cannot write well; hence the school 
must take his writing in hand. The spirit of all these efforts 
to bring the vernacular into the course of study is the same.

164 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
They all begin with the remote, the unusual, and the ab- 
stract. It is very hard to organize any plan of school work 
which will emphasize the common use of the vernacular. 
ENGLISH COMMONLY TREATED AS A SPECIAL SUBJECT 
~~» At the present time we are in the curious situation of 
desiring to recognize the vernacular to the fullest possible 
extent, and yet we are unable to see that the vernacular 
means expression whenever and wherever it appears. Every 
one realizes that students are defective in their oral expres- 
sions even in their English recitations. Students, after 
years of schooling, do not know how to carry on for any 
length of time a coherent and continued discussion — evi- 
dence enough that the schools and the English department 
‘Y have not mastered their problem of training children in 
coherent common use of the vernacular. It is assumed that 
children will be able to get on in history and physics and 
mathematics because the vernacular is there the common 
medium of expression. The fact is that half the difficulty 
es of children in these subject-matter courses arises from their 
inability to understand English sentences. The English 
department and the school in general continue to assume 
that the business of the English department is to deal only 
with those unusual phases of the vernacular which are not 
of daily significance. Therefore we find the English classes 
devoting themselves to composition or literary studies of a 
type which has very little relation to practical life and little 
relation to the rest of the work of the school. 
In opposition to the assumption that English is a special 
subject the effort is sometimes made to call attention to the 
desirability of a constant supervision of the use of the ver- 
nacular throughout the day and throughout all of the activ- 
ities of the students. This plea gets scanty hearing, because 
our educational system at the present time is divided into
-P-A-G-E-175
THE ENGLISH PROBLEM 165 
a number of special interests, and there seems to be no one 
now responsible for the general training of students except, 
possibly, administrative officers. One reads with a good 
deal of interest the plea of the English teacher that he is 
quite unable to master the situation because he has no 
authority over other members of the high-school faculty; 1< 
that only the principal can bring about the reforms which 
are now needed in English training in the schools. This 
means, from the side of the English teachers, that they 
are unable for some reason to present with compelling 
force arguments in favor of a general cultivation of the 
mother tongue. 
Members of other departments undoubtedly look upon 
the work of the English department as a special and closely 
delimited phase of training. Teachers of English in the 
high schools are thought of as a group of people who have 
been trained in a specialty. That specialty is literary form. 
The ordinary English teacher knows the classics of our 
language and is interested in bringing to the attention of 
students the virtues of these English classics. He would 
encourage the student to imitate these classics much as the 
teacher of Latin used to try to induce his students to imi- 
tate Cicero. For the most part English teachers, trained 
as literary critics, are wholly unaware of the fact that their ~ 
place on the program of the high school of to-day depends 
upon something more fundamental than interest in literary 
form. When, therefore, the English teacher gives a course 
which is virtually a course in the history of literary form 
coupled with a few technical exercises which aim to culti- 
vate literary form in his students, he widens the chasm 
between himself and all of the other departments, since 
the other departments are interested in the vernacular for

Teaching of English Composition,’ Proceedings of the National Educa- 
tion Association, 1913, p. 478. See also School Review, 1918, p. 598. 
   
-P-A-G-E-176
  166 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
wholly different reasons. The man who teaches science can- 
not be made excessively enthusiastic about literary form 
and its history. His use of English is for an entirely dif- 
ferent reason. He may not know how to tell the English 
department just what he wants. Indeed, he is often so dis- 
gusted with the work which is now done in English that 
he will not take pains even to consider how the English 
department may be improved.! 
GRAVE DANGERS OF SPECIALIZATION 
There is a lack of unity of purpose and lack of sympathy 
in the handling of expression in schools which grows out of 
the fact that both the man of science and the teacher of 
English are specialists. Ilustration after illustration of this 
highly specialized interest can be found in the current 
literature which deals with the teaching of English in the 
high school. There is a conspicuous illustration of this in 
Mr. Percival Chubb’s book, “ The Teaching of English.”? 
The book sets forth in vigorous terms the desirability of 
more training in English in the high school and the elemen- 
tary school. In his effort to define the general purpose of 
English during the adolescent period, Mr. Chubb says on 
1An anonymous writer in a communication published in Science, 
September 4, 1914 (N.S., Vol. XL), pp. 344-346, gives an excellent 
example of the temper of the teacher of science toward rhetoric. The 
communication is an answer to a review published in the February (1914) 
issue of Modern Language Notes of ‘Representative Essays in Modern 
Thought,” by Steeves and Ristine. The book under discussion is written 
in the effort to stimulate the study of other forms of literature than the 
belles lettres commonly taken up in English courses. The conclusion of 
the discussion is given in the following sentence: ‘And yet, if rhetoric 
instructors do not awake, some time or other scientists, engineers, and 
lawyers will somehow face the problem of themselves instilling the prin- 
ciples of unity and coherence into their promising students.”” The whole 
communication is a most urgent plea for the study of themes of a scien- 
tific and practical type.

page 239 that one of the main divisions of literature which 
should receive attention in the secondary school is that<— 
which deals with vocational subjects. He reviews enthusi- 
astically the position taken by G. Stanley Hall, that the vast 
majority of high-school graduates should get social training 
through the vernacular. They should be given that kind of 
reading and opportunity for expression which will prepare 
them for social and personal life in the vocations. One 
reads this part of the book with great interest, and assumes 
that now, at least, we have reached the point where the 
vocations are to receive adequate attention from the Eng- 
lish teachers. He goes on through the book, and, to his 
astonishment, finds that all of the references to books that 
are actually to be used are of the conventional literary type. 
There is not mentioned in the whole volume a single book 
of a strictly technical type. The specialist in English liter- 
ature has once more shown that he does not have any idea 
of his duty to the vernacular in general. One is reminded 
of the story told by the high-school principal, who, after 
urging his English teachers to put in some vocational read- 
ing, encountered a teacher glowing with enthusiasm because 
of her success in complying with his suggestion. She was 
reading “Silas Marner” with her class, and since Silas was 
a weaver, she was introducing vocational ideas at the same 
time that she satisfied the college-entrance requirements. 
ENGLISH PROGRAM SHOULD BE REDUCED 
Probably the whole fraternity of teachers of English 
would ask, if they were confronted by such a remark as the 
foregoing, “What is expected? Are the high schools to , 
devote themselves to the reading of books on mechanics ? 
Is the English department failing to do its duty when it 
devotes itself to its proper task of training students to 
appreciate and produce higher things?” The argument
-P-A-G-E-178
  168 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
would undoubtedly be presented that it is the business of 
the English department to see to it that the student carries 
away an appreciation of those books which are not discussed 
in the other classes. Undoubtedly there is some justification 
for this specialized kind of training ; but the point which is 
to be made is that the school program of the present day 
gives to English an amount of time which is entirely at 
variance with the assumption that English is a specialized 
subject. No high-school faculty which votes for four years 
of English to be required of every student would vote that 
amount of time if the statement could be explicitly put 
before them that these courses are all to be devoted to the 
development of literary form. This amount of time is voted 
because it is assumed that English somehow is to be regarded 
as a fundamental, underlying subject, of more significance 
in the life of students than any other single subject. The 
deplorable fact is that after all of this time has been given 
~—sto English teachers, they do not realize that it is their duty — 
to distribute it in some fashion which will comport with 
the assumption on which the time was given. Perhaps two 
courses in our present-day high-school course of study 
could be justified as requirements if English continues to 
be what it is now, namely, training in literary form; but 
certainly there ought not to be four courses required of 
students, nor ought there to be three, and there may be 
some question whether it will not be wiser to make even 
the second English course elective. 
THE UNSOLVED PROBLEM OF TEACHING READING 
There is another aspect of this matter which ought, per- 
haps, to be discussed in reénforcing the general criticism 
of English work contained in the preceding paragraph. It 
is assumed that high-school students know how to get the 
meaning out of paragraphs which they read; that is, it is 
 
-P-A-G-E-179
  
THE ENGLISH PROBLEM 169 
assumed that the work of elementary education has been 
satisfactorily completed, and that elementary reading has 
prepared students for all their later work. The fact is, that ie 
the ordinary student does not know how to read economi- 
cally. He is very clumsy in his methods of getting the 
meaning from his textbook in history or his textbook in 
science. This deficiency of the high-school student is of 
importance both to the special teacher, who is training the 
student in history and science, and also to the English 
teacher, who is training him in reading. Both teachers, Zz 
however, overlook the necessity of training in reading and 
in interpretation of what is read. We have not yet learned 
the lesson that the commonplace activities are, after all, the 
most important activities to be trained. Why we should 
assume that the child knows how to take up and study a 
book economically when no one has ever helped him to see 
the importance of economy in his reading, is difficult for the 
student of education who is not a specialist in English to 
understand. To the student of education who sees history 
and science and English literature all as phases of the gen- 
eral effort to train the mental processes of children, the“ 
fundamental and general requirement, that mental processes 
be trained so that mental work can be done in an economical 
way, is more significant for the child’s training than is the 
demand for any particular type of training. This general‘ 
demand, that the student know how to study, is neglected 
by too many teachers because they are interested in some 
particular subject matter. The psychologist, on the other 
hand, who insists upon the recognition of the general fun- 
damental needs of all students, discovers that there is no 
one especially charged in the school with the duty of train- 
ing children how to use books. 
The critical student of education feels justified in charg- 
ing this deficiency most heavily against the teachers of 
English because they have so much time given them and
-P-A-G-E-180
  170 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
because they have so little content requiring to be taken up. 
But the English teachers, like the other special teachers, are 
contributing what they can to the development of uneco- 
nomical habits of the use of books. No one who has seen 
an English class working with the question-and-answer 
method on a literary masterpiece, such as “Ivanhoe” or 
“Silas Marner,” can fail to recognize the fact that asking 
questions about a book, and asking questions in such detail 
that the student’s attention is distracted from the general 
“Ystory to the minutiz of the matter on successive pages, is the 
worst possible preparation for the use of books. English 
teachers are absorbed in subject matter just as are the 
teachers in other departments. They are so much absorbed 
in subject matter that they do not realize that they are im- 
peding in many cases the student’s mental development in 
~sthe use of books. It would be very much better to allow a 
student to read the whole of “ Ivanhoe” through at four or 
five sittings than to spread the study of this book over half a 
year. Requiring the student to digest a story in small frag- 
ments and to answer the most minute questions with regard 
’ to each fragment is to cultivate a habit of mind with regard 
to books which is utterly disastrous for later life. The stu- 
dent gets an impression that a story of this sort is a Hercu- 
lean intellectual problem. He will never be stimulated to 
take up a book of this sort in leisure hours in his later life if 
he is impressed with the immensity of the undertaking. 
Tue Sap STATE OF ENGLISH COMPOSITION 
What the student of education finds to criticize in the 
class in literature fades into insignificance when he follows 
the English teacher into that burying ground of human 
interests, the class in composition. Where shall the bewil- 
dered observer begin his psychological analysis of these so- 
called exercises ? Do they make for economy of expression ?
-P-A-G-E-181
THE ENGLISH PROBLEM ugg 
When a student is given one of the usual subjects 
presented to the composition class, he is fortunate if. he 
has ideas that would cover half a page. He is encouraged 
to write these few ideas in a form which will cover three 
or four pages. Indeed, the requirement commonly set 
down is one which states the amount required rather than 
the quality. The student is told to write two pages on a 
given subject. Furthermore, the subject is frankly acknowl- _ 
edged to be one which is of no practical value. He writes . 
on it in the English class because it is of no value and 
therefore can properly be made a subject of discussion from 
the point of view of its style rather than from the point of 
view of its usefulness to anybody who comes in contact with 
it. A student who has thus been trained in the making of 
useless paragraphs is likely to look on paragraphs in general 
as belonging to the same type. He will come to think of 
the writer of books as a person who has set himself a task 
of covering so and so many pages with words, and his whole 
notion of literature will be perverted by his own frantic 
efforts to fulfill a certain requirement on a subject in which 
he is not interested and on which he has nothing to say. The 
written page comes to be for him a sham battlefield, different 
from the industries or practical activities of life, where prac- 
tical efforts are made in the spirit of serious accomplishment. 
Lovunspury ON ENGLISH COMPOSITION 
Perhaps one would be less bold in such estimates of 
composition if he did not have the support of that veteran 
teacher of English, Professor Lounsbury. In commenting 
on required composition, even in college, he writes : 1 
I am by no means disposed to go so far as the historian of 
New England, John Gorham Palfrey, who, as I have been told, 
1 Thomas R. Lounsbury, ‘Compulsory Composition in Colleges,’ 
Harper's Magazine, November, 1911, Vol. CX XIII, pp. 866-880. 
 
-P-A-G-E-182
  172 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
was wont to express the desire that an act of Congress should 
be passed forbidding on pain of death anyone under twenty-one 
years of age to write a sentence. Excess in one direction can 
not be remedied by excess in the opposite. Still, none the less 
am I thoroughly convinced that altogether undue importance 
is attached to exercises in English composition, especially 
compulsory exercises; that the benefits to be derived from the 
general practice in schools is vastly overrated ; that the criticism 
of themes, even when it is fully competent, is in the majority of 
cases of little value to the recipient; that in a large number 
of instances the criticism is and must ever be more or less in- 
competent; and that when the corrections which are made are 
made inefficiently and unintelligently, as is too often the case, 
the results are distinctly more harmful than helpful. (P. 869.) 
Professor Lounsbury would have us abandon the whole 
farce, and recognize that the ordinary student can never 
produce literature and never ought to be perverted in his 
tastes by having to contemplate his own productions. The 
student ought to be introduced in a large and liberal way 
to some of the vital productions in his mother tongue, and 
he ought to have these set before him not as subjects for 
minute scrutiny and clumsy imitation but rather as examples 
of documents which have molded history and guided the 
thinking of men in politics and religion and in the organi- 
zation of social institutions. 
DANGERS OF EXTREME FORMALISM 
The time will certainly come when the historian of edu- 
cation will look back upon the present period of high- 
school composition and high-school dissection of literature 
as one of the most formal periods in education. It will be 
said of us that we gave up all of the advantages of a 
compact and consecutive course in the classics before we 
succeeded in bringing into the high-school curriculum 
anything that gives the continuity and definiteness of
-P-A-G-E-183
  THE ENGLISH PROBLEM 173 
training that these older courses provided. It will be said 
that we wasted the time of our students on a type of liter- 
ary pedantry which did not justify itself even to the teachers 
of the subject itself. In evidence of this the writings of the 
teachers of English will be quoted. There is no group 
of teachers who more frankly acknowledge the complete 
failure 1 of the work which they are doing. They disagree 
with each other at every point with regard to the content 
and methodology of their work. They frankly report the 
results of their own tests to show that high-school students 
and college students alike fail to meet even the most ele- 
mentary standards of achievement which are set up. Yet 
they insist that they must have the time which they now 
occupy, and indeed in some quarters they clamor for more 
time and attention. They complain about the number of 
hours that they have to spend in correcting compositions, 
and ask for more assistance.2 They point out the fact that 
their present mode of teaching wears out teachers so rapidly 
that the average professional life of an English teacher is 
less than that of members of other departments.’ In the 
midst of acknowledged failure and chaos they keep insist- 
ing that what they are doing is of the highest importance. 
They scoff at the courses in manual training and voca- 
tional training. They criticize the sciences as uncouth and 
unesthetic. They charge the classics with formalism, and 
they regard mathematics as abstract and uninspiring.

  CHAPTER IX 
THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ENGLISH COURSES 
It is the purpose of this chapter to discuss the mental proc- 
esses which are cultivated in the English courses ordinarily 
administered in high schools. We shall follow this discussion 
by a study of the methods proposed for teaching foreign lan- 
guages, and then come back to the problem of the relation 
of verbal consciousness to other types of mental activity. 
CARPENTER ON THE PURPOSE OF ENGLISH TEACHING 
In his statement of the present-day purpose of the Eng- 
lish course, Professor Carpenter contrasts our period with 
two earlier movements. First there was a period in which 
grammatical correctness was the aim. This was the period 
of Lindley Murray and Noah Webster, and covers the mid- 
dle half of the nineteenth century. Then came from 1874 
on, after the Harvard entrance examination in English 
was established, a period of emphasis on rhetorical study. 
“ The third ideal, that now rapidly coming into prominence, 
is that of familiarity with, and appreciation of, English 
literature.” Accepting Professor Carpenter's classification, 
we may omit from discussion grammar, except in so far as 
it survives in the rhetorics; we must consider the aims of 
rhetoric, since the rhetoric period is not yet passed, and we 
must take up the newer movement, which is devoted to 
literary appreciation.

CoMPARISON OF TEXTBOOKS ON RHETORIC 
Within rhetoric itself the most conspicuous change is 
from a long statement of rules and principles to a very great 
abbreviation of rules and much attention to practice, espe- 
cially written practice. Exercises, then, are an important 
part of any book on composition. Indeed, the modern text- 
book often bears in its title the frank emphasis upon exer- 
cises. “ English Composition,” “Essentials of Exposition 
and Argument,” “Practical Training in English,” are 
among the familiar titles of the modern rhetorics. 
Let us contrast the chapters of one of the newer rhetorics 
with the chapter headings of one of the older books. The 
modern book? treats, in successive chapters, The Sentence ; 
Forms of Discourse, Narration; Forms of Discourse, De- 
scription ; Letter Writing ; Forms of Discourse, Exposition ; 
Forms of Discourse, Argumentation; Figures of Speech; 
Verse Forms. The older book? has such chapters as the 
following: Style; Simplicity ; Precision; Purity; Perspi- 
cuity in Sentences; Perspicuity in General; Figures of 
Speech; Figures of Relativity arising from the Perception 
of Resemblance ; Figures of Gradation ; Figures of Empha- 
sis ; Part III, Harmony in Style (including seven chapters) ; 
Part V, The Emotions (including chapters on The Beau- 
tiful, The Fantastic, etc.); Part VI, The General Depart- 
ments of Literature (including Description, Narration, etc.). 
This contrast shows how greatly rhetoric has been sim- 
plified. The older book was, to be sure, used in college 
more frequently than in high school, but it is typical of the 
painstaking effort of the rhetoricians of that date to be 
inclusive. The present-day rhetorician aims to stimulate

composition, and reduces his statement of principles to 
the smallest possible compass. 
Turning now to the remnant of rhetoric which has sur- 
vived, we are impressed at once with the frequent excursions 
which every author makes into psychology. The student is 
called upon to consider how language portrays ideas. 
Just as the artist has to avoid certain combinations of colors 
because they offend the eye, so any person, using language to 
communicate his ideas, must obey the rules of language if he 
wishes to please people by what he says.... A sentence has 
been defined as a group of words expressing a complete thought. 
. Sentences may be defective because they are not the full 
expression of one complete thought.’ 
Ruetoric A ForMAL Stupy 
These examples show clearly that one of the major func- 
tions of rhetoric is to turn the student’s thought to his 
mental processes as distinguished from the content about 
which these processes are concerned. Rhetoric is a science 
of the forms of thinking and expression. The older rhet- 
oricians were fully aware of the relation of their subject to 
logic. Indeed, the old-fashioned course was often a course 
which explicitly combined logic and rhetoric. The high- 
school student has difficulty with this formal science because 
he is not mature enough to distinguish between his thought- 
process and the content of his thought. The teacher asks 
him to write on his vacation, and he does so. He then dis- 
covers that the teacher does not care at all about the vaca- 
tion or anything pertaining to it. The teacher is interested 
rather in the way one thinks and the way one expresses 
himself. Very often the student is still further confused 
~)by the contrast between thought and expression. He finds 
‘that one may have an idea, but not be able to get it into 
1 W. F. Webster, op. cit., pp. 1, 2, 8.  
-P-A-G-E-187
  
  THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ENGLISH COURSES 177 
acceptable form for communication. He now has three 
things to consider: ideas, how one has ideas and arranges 
them, and finally how one expresses ideas. 
The complexity of the situation which thus faces the stu- 
dent is hardly understood by adults. Most mature minds 
have faced in some form or other the distinction between 
content of thought and the forms of thought. But the 
high-school student does not readily grasp this distinction 
and is seldom interested in the introspective facts. Just as 
soon as an adult begins to talk about forms of thought to 
a high-school student who is absorbed in some real content 
and quite unconcerned about his own mind, there is sure 
to develop an educational situation which is confused and 
unproductive. The student is absorbed in things and in 
people and their doings. He is not likely to look into 
his mind for forms of thought. On the other hand, a teacher 
who becomes absorbed in noting how his students think and 
express themselves will find the problem of form so inter- 
esting that he will forget all about the subject matter. He 
will become an observer of thought-processes and modes of 
expression and will be unable to understand why his students 
are not interested, as he is, in the forms of experience. The 
breach between student and teacher may become infinite. 
There is one common ground on which teacher and 
student may meet and often do meet; that is, in a study 
of the history and structure of language. So the study of 
an elementary form of science of language comes to be in 
many cases the real object of attention in the rhetoric 
class. The history of particular words is an interesting 
chapter in this kind of rhetoric. The structure of the 
sentence, the principles of agreement and subordination, 
become the absorbing topics. Such a study is not with- 
out value. Students learn something about language and 
its history, and they will doubtless be aided in the long 
run by such knowledge in controlling their own expression.
-P-A-G-E-188
178 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
There is another sense in which rhetorical knowledge of 
the type which we have been discussing is formal. A stu- 
dent may know about words and sentences and yet not 
apply his knowledge in his own performances. The psychol- 
ogy of application of knowledge turns up again here as it 
did in the case of mathematics. We shall have to let the 
problem thus suggested wait, noting that here, as in other 
courses, the problem of applications presents itself as one 
of the most important problems in education. 
Tue Four FuNDAMENTAL Forms oF DiscouRSsE 
There is one series of topics which appears in all of the 
rhetorics, namely, the four fundamental forms of discourse : 
narration, description, exposition, and argument. Some 
writers do not attempt to deal with all; some use the clas- 
sification as the basis of all their treatment; while others 
touch upon it only lightly, devoting the major part of their 
time and attention to details rather than to these more 
general distinctions. 
—» The four fundamental forms of discourse may be treated 
‘as representing four different mental attitudes. They can 
also be discussed from the side of content when the empha- 
sis is laid on the fact that they differ in the type of subject 
matter which they present. Let us select a number of state- 
ments illustrating the fact that the classification of forms 
of discourse describes mental attitudes. Thus in discussing 
narration one author states: 
The mind does not think in single words, complete enough 
so that they represent a single idea. ... Such a group of words 
is like a picture thrown upon a screen... . And just as a series 
of single pictures tells a story at the moving picture show, soa 
series of groups of words tells a story in man’s everyday life. 
1 W.F. Webster, English for Secondary Schools, p. 63.
-P-A-G-E-189
  
THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ENGLISH COURSES 179 
Later he defines description in these terms: 
In the preceding chapter it has been pointed out that the 
sequence of language is well adapted to detail the sequence of 
action in a narrative. For the purpose of presenting a picture, 
language has serious drawbacks; the picture has to be shown 
in pieces.... Each [phrase] introduces a new element into 
the picture; and then, from these phrases the reader must con- 
struct the real picture (p.105). Exposition treats of abstract 
ideas, either general terms like horse, man, tree; or propo- 
sitions (p. 202). 
On the other hand, the attempt is often made to define 
each of the forms of discourse from the point of view of 
content. “All composition may be arranged in two great 
groups. The first group includes composition that deals 
with real things and incidents; the second group includes 
compositions that deal with thoughts and ideas” (p. 55). 
The quotations which have been given show how easy it 
is to take first the psychological attitude and then to turn 
directly to the objective attitude. That students are con- 
fused by these different points of view is hardly to be 
wondered at when their immaturity and lack of training in 
introspective analysis is kept in mind. Rhetoric of the psy- 
chological type is very abstract and vague to the ordinary 
student. Rhetoric based on the effort to classify subject 
matter is likely to get the student into difficulty, because 
subject matter refuses to follow the lines laid down in the 
classification. The classification is essentially logical and 
psychological. 
Enough has been said in the foregoing analysis of text- 
books to bring out clearly three general facts. First, the older. 
textbooks dealt frankly with the forms of experience and 
expression; the later books attempt to make rhetoric con-/ 
crete and thus often confuse with considerations about 
subject matter a study which is essentially a formal sub- 
ject. Second, the study of formal aspects of expression is <
-P-A-G-E-190
  180 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
an abstract study, and high-school students can only with 
difficulty neglect that in which they are most interested, 
namely, subject matter, to concentrate attention on form. 
Finally, present-day rhetoric is not complete or successful 
even on its own chosen grounds. It does not deal adequately 
with subject-matter problems because it is divorced in its 
organization from subject-matter courses. 
ORAL CoMposiTION 
In the general books on teaching English in high schools 
a problem is discussed which is omitted from most texts; 
Smamely, the problem of oral composition. When one goes to 
the classes in English as actually conducted, one finds very 
little oral composition. This is, perhaps, one of the greatest 
weaknesses of American schools. The student in an Amer- 
ican class seldom says more than three sentences, and often 
\\\he says only a word or two. Teachers do not seem to 
realize the value of continuous discourse, and the rhetoric 
books, while they talk about argument, very seldom give 
any serious attention to oral argumentation. Oral expression 
is, in its psychological elements and organization, very dif- 
ferent from written composition. Oral composition must 
be rapid. Writing may be very deliberate. Oral composi- | 
tion is less likely to be influenced by the models which the 
student has read. When one is writing, the length of the 
sentence, the character of the words used, and other details 
of expression, such as the rhythm of phrases, will all be de- 
termined by the qualities of writing activities as much as 
by anything relating to the vocal activities. It is a mistake 
to assume that oral and written composition are the same. 
The lack of regard for oral expression has been commented 
on before as an evidence that the English teacher does not 
view his task broadly enough. 
 
-P-A-G-E-191
  
THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ENGLISH COURSES 181 
‘VERSE USED IN COMPOSITION 
A word may be added with regard to verse as a form of 
composition. Objection to the use of verse often arises from 
the fact that the mind of the student is likely to associate 
verse with sentiment, and the temptation to indulge in 
trivial sentimentality is overpowering when composition is 
undertaken in this form. On the other hand, there is no 
type of composition which so definitely checks and controls/ 
the form of the student’s work as versification. If some of 
the narrative poems are adopted as models so as to over- 
come the objection of sentimentality, it is possible to use 
verse-making as a very compelling type of formal train- 
ing. Any work which checks itself is excellent material 
to use in training an immature student, because the rules 
are automatically kept before the student’s mind by the 
product itself. 
One cannot leave the topic of rhetoric and the forms of 
expression without commenting once more on the dangers < 
of formal work in the English class. Formal training is not 
damaging to the student if it is a part of a more general 
system of education in which form is ultimately filled with 
productive content. Training in form can always justify 
itself as a necessary part of the total equipment of the 
student. The danger arises when form replaces complete 
training. When form becomes an end, then the system of 
education has abandoned its legitimate function, which is to 
develop the individual’s experience. Form which is magni- 
fied above content is empty and a burden. Many a rhetoric 
class exhibits the sad spectacle of a teacher absorbed in’ 
form and quite unconscious of his weakness. The students 
in such a class do not know what the difficulty is, but they 
realize that the subject is utterly lacking in inspiration and 
they are the more confused because they do not see what 
is the purpose of the work.

182 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
PsYCHOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS IN A RHETORIC CLASS 
Observations made in a rhetoric class add three general 
statements to those which have been derived from a study 
of the texts. In the first place, the questions asked are 
_ usually of such a character that any one of several differ- 
“ent answers will satisfy the demand. What criticism is to 
be offered of the paragraph is a typical question. The stu- 
dents now begin to cast about for the teacher’s probable 
idea in asking the question. Very often it is a lottery, and 
the student knows it and is prepared to take two or three 
trials if the teacher’s patience holds out. 
In the second place, the number of different kinds of 
judgment which a student is called upon to pass is much 
greater than in most subjects. In mathematics the judg- 
ments and comparisons are fairly uniform in type and the 
different varieties are limited in number. Not so in Eng- 
lish. The following types were enumerated in one period. 
Whether the author was recording a fact or a fictitious idea 
was investigated, and the students passed judgments on the 
evidences submitted. Again, the relative importance of the 
fact stated was discussed. This led to the general discussion 
of the importance of the fact for the narrative and the im- 
portance of the fact for the real outcome. The students 
were asked to judge of the appropriateness of the narrative 
with a view to arousing the desired ideas in the audience. 
This called for a discussion of the mental processes of the 
audience. What kind of emotions do people have in such 
cases? Is the narrative detailed enough? Is the order of 
events such as to produce the most vivid effect? In this 
connection a little attention was given to the individual 
words employed, and very shortly the discussion drifted off 
into a study of the history and form of words. The stu- 
dents were then brought back to a discussion of the way in 
which the passages illustrated rhetorical principles studied
-P-A-G-E-193
  THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ENGLISH COURSES 183 
earlier in the course. This led to a review and application 
of general principles regarding form. Finally, the students 
were asked to compare this passage with others with refer- 
ence to the form and with reference to the content. 
Such an array of judgments makes it perfectly clear that 
rhetoric is a general subject. The reason why it is so hard 
to define courses in English and to secure uniformity in 
these courses is to be found in the infinite variety of 
ends which may be sought with identically the same text 
in rhetoric and identically the same illustrative material. 
Teachers of rhetoric recognize this fact when they say that 
the English teacher’s personality is a very large factor — 
more of a factor than the personality of the teacher of math- 
ematics. In the observations recounted above, it was fortu- 
nately unnecessary to include the petty insistence which 
some instructors feel obliged to exhibit about the absolutely 
formal matters of margin, spelling, punctuation, ete. 
In the third place, one notes a strong tendency on the 
part of both teacher and students to seek some solid, uni- 
form content for thought by reducing the whole exercise 
to a repetition of a few stereotyped phrases. ‘The rhetoric < 
class becomes a kind of memory exercise. Students try 
to answer every question in some formula from the book. 
One student evidently bereft of all ideas answers blandly, 
“The passage lacks unity.” When the matter is pursued 
further, it does not appear that he understood either unity 
or the passage. This frantic devotion to the text is clear 
evidence of the desire of the student to get something 
tangible in the midst of the whirl of things. When one sees 
the corrected compositions of a class, he realizes why the 
manifold judgments which are possible and even attempted 
gradually get reduced to a few simple, formal matters. 
These formal matters can be noted with red ink with a 
definiteness that is quite impossible when one tries to deal 
with the other, larger matters that are suggested.  
-P-A-G-E-194
  184 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
A visit to a rhetoric class leaves one with the impression 
that too much has been undertaken and too little carried 
through. The difficulty of organizing work in English is 
evidently great. The layman is led to believe that the 
subject should be subdivided and the parts attacked in 
succession. 
PROBLEMS OF LITERATURE 
From the discussion of modes of expression we turn to 
a discussion of that phase of English which is designated 
as literature. The business of class exercises and study in 
“literature is to cultivate appreciation. There is a certain 
mysticism in the minds of many teachers about appreciation. 
Taste is proverbially a purely personal and quite inexpli- 
cable trait. The power of appreciation is accordingly said to 
rest on subconscious judgments which are very vivid but 
quite incapable of communication. Such statements regard- 
ing the nature of the process of appreciation are, of course, 
,a challenge to the psychologist. Appreciation is a mental 
\ process and is capable of training under direct guidance, 
while to some extent it seems to mature without direct 
guidance. Our problem is to discover what is the mental 
and physiological mechanism involved in appreciation, and 
thus to throw light on the methods of its training. In other 
words, it is here, as always, the business of psychology to 
refuse to be satisfied with mysticism. Appreciation must 
be analyzed and explained. 
RHYTHM AS A FUNDAMENTAL IN LITERARY ForM 
For the purposes of our'study we shall begin with a very 
simple form of appreciation. Professor Sievers 1 has pointed 
out the fact that every writer and speaker has certain 
1G. E. Sievers, Grundziige der Phonetik, especially Cap. XXXI- 
XXXVI. Breitkopf und Hartel, 1893.
-P-A-G-E-195
    THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ENGLISH COURSES 185 
typical rhythms of speech and phraseology. In his lectures 
he goes so far as to assert that it is possible to determine 
the authorship of a manuscript by finding out the rhythm 
in which the successive phrases fall. Furthermore, he calls 
attention to the fact that the rhythms which express differ- 
ent types of emotional reaction differ from each other. Thus 
the writer or speaker who is excited by some intense emotion 
will write in short and rapid rhythm and will speak in the 
same fashion, whereas the long deliberate periods of un- 
emotional discourse indicate an entirely different attitude 
of mind and body. These rhythms attaching to different 
emotional situations are recognized, though not always 
explicitly distinguished, from the total expression by the 
reader and by the author. If there is a fitness in the partic- 
ular rhythm, so that the content of the sentence and its 
rhythm are felt to be appropriate, we speak of the style as 
satisfactory. If, on the other hand, there is any incongruity 
which gives us a content of one type and a rhythm of a 
wholly different type, we speak of the style as inappro- 
priate. Undoubtedly most people are more sensitive to the 
rhythms in oral speech than in written speech. When, 
therefore, one wishes to bring out the full significance of a 
paragraph which expresses strong emotion he can do it best 
by reading it aloud. This does not mean that he should 
give to each word any peculiar intonation; indeed, the 
emotion is expressed not by single words and their emphasis, 
but rather by the general rhythm of the whole paragraph. 
Some teachers of reading make much of the principle that 
the voice must be raised and lowered so as to express the 
emotions which are carried by certain words. It is often 
not the change in pitch which is significant in an emotional 
passage. The rate at which words flow is the more signifi- 
cant fact. 
As stated above, the ordinary individual frequently does 
not analyze the situation far enough to pick out the rhythm
-P-A-G-E-196
(SB a i a a otis a a ar a 
186 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
as a separate part of the total situation. The passage seems 
to him to have a certain emotional coloring, and he associates 
this emotional coloring with the words and with the ideas 
as they flow through his mind. He does not realize that 
the source of the emotional experience is the rhythm of the 
words rather than their content. The meaning of this 
statement can perhaps be best illustrated by referring to 
the fact that the little child who is first learning to read 
does not read sentences, but reads single words or short 
phrases. For him the sentence and the thought are broken 
up so much that he gains the meaning very laboriously. 
As soon as he masters the sentence so that he can read 
it with a single rising or falling inflection embracing the 
whole series of words, he will be expressing a degree of 
maturity in the reading process which is instantly recognized 
by the teacher. So significant is this grouping together 
of all the words of a sentence that one can test by the 
child’s intonation his ability to master the whole of an idea 
as distinguished from .its separate elements. There is no 
more significant development in the child’s ability to read _ 
poetry than his ability to keep the voice from dropping at 
the end of a line which does not finish a given idea. To 
get beyond the single verse and modulate the voice so as 
to include the next verse in a single expression shows that 
the whole idea and the emotional experience which properly 
attaches to it have come to be more significant for the child 
than the single word or the mechanical processes involved 
in reading. To be governed by the ends of the lines of 
poetry is a relatively primitive stage of development; to 
get beyond this early stage of development and have the 
true appreciation of the whole idea involves a rhythm of 
speech and reading which is superior to the rhythm of the 
individual lines. 
 
-P-A-G-E-197
THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ENGLISH COURSES 187 
APPRECIATION AN ACTIVE PROCESS 
This discussion of rhythm makes it obvious that appre- 
ciation of a full sentence or passage is by no means a 
purely passive affair. Intelligent apprehension of meaning 
depends upon a general response to a total situation, and 
this response is an active process. The rhythm here un- 
der discussion cannot be described as a purely ideational 
matter. Rhythm is a matter of nervous activity and is un- 
doubtedly related to the fact that all language involves 
certain direct muscular responses. The rhythms of an 
author or reader must not be too long or they will be 
impossible of fluent utterance. Fluent utterance is a 
matter of respiration and reaction of the muscles of the 
vocal cords and mouth. The laws of articulation thus 
govern our appreciation of passages. Even when the artic- 
ulation is not actually carried out in full, we are con- 
trolled in our enjoyment of passages by the articulations 
which they suggest. 
Rhythm is one of the instruments employed in arousing 
others. Not only does each writer have his own rhythm, 
but he is effective just in the degree in which he transmits 
to his readers his own reaction. Thus, when one becomes a 
reader his appreciation is not limited to forms of reaction 
which he originates. If one reads the long sonorous lines 
of Milton’s “ Paradise Lost,” he gets an elevated emotion 
which originated with Milton and is transmitted to the 
appreciating individual through the reactions which are in- 
duced in him by his reading. One could get from “ Par- 
adise Lost” the lofty emotions conveyed by the poem even 
if he were quite unable to originate anything of the same 
sort himself. All that is necessary is that he should be able 
sufficiently to follow the words and sentence structures 
to reproduce in himself the reactions which the author
-P-A-G-E-198
188 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
desired. Well-arranged words thus induce rhythmical re- 
actions, at the same time that they carry a freightage of 
other meanings through their appeal to other active func- 
tions of the individual. 
REACTIONS RELATED TO GRAMMATICAL STRUCTURES 
Up to this point we have dealt primarily with the rhythm 
of sentences and its connection with emotional life. There 
are, however, a great variety of other forms of reaction 
which are established during the cultivation of language 
and during the development of the ability to read. Thus, 
one acquires, as pointed out in the last chapter, definite 
“modes of reaction for the different parts of speech. If one 
uses a preposition, there is in his experience a definite de- 
mand for an object to follow this preposition. This demand 
is no shadowy mental desire; it is a real physical need. It 
is to be explained by the fact that in expressions preposi- 
tions have always been followed by objects. We have 
learned prepositions and objects as a single verbal reaction. 
We learn to move our vocal cords in certain series of ex- 
pressions and our whole motor organization is such that 
we feel the need of complete expressions. 
~, Grammatical habits are real motor habits. Just as the 
left hand tends to follow the right in its upward and down- 
ward movements, so our phrases are expressions of our sys- 
tems of speech. Our language habits are as fixed as our 
habits of facial expression. Let one note his experience 
when the object of a preposition is omitted. Read the 
partial sentence, “This book lies on. . .”. The impulse to 
go on beyond the preposition is as strong as the impulse to 
look around when one hears a sound. Again, anyone who 
has experienced the shock of hearing a person say “ With 
‘you and I” will realize how pungent is the bodily feeling 
which is produced by the preposition “with” followed by
-P-A-G-E-199
THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ENGLISH COURSES 189 
the pronoun “I.” One has the same kind of experience in 
this case as that which shocks him when he makes a false 
step at the top of the stairs. There is a physical jolt which 
is altogether out of proportion to any actual sensory expe- 
rience which he encounters. The preparation and the ten- 
sion of all of his muscles is in conflict with the expression 
which is executed contrary to his expectations. 
There are other grammatical adjustments, as when one 
uses the subject of a sentence and starts to satisfy his feel- 
ing of the necessity for a verb. Not only is this connection 
between subject and predicate a definite one in the sense 
that the verb must follow, but the verb must be of a par- 
ticular form. Anyone who has used a plural noun begins 
to feel the necessity of a plural verb. If the sentence be- 
comes long and involved he may be satisfied with a verb 
of the wrong number. This is particularly true when qual- 
ifying words which have a number different from that of 
the subject are interposed between the subject and the verb 
itself. In all these cases, however, we have examples of 
definite active adjustments on the part of the speaker, 
which adjustments have come to be so fixed in form that if 
one is speaking or reading he demands the proper consum- 
mation of the expression in conformity to his habit. One 
will never be satisfied to have an author break through the 
habits of his own speech to the extent of using a singular 
verb with a plural subject or to the extent of using a prep- 
osition without an object. On the other hand, one is 
quite willing to follow an author beyond his own personal 
ability to develop sentence structure. There is nothing 
more interesting than to read a sentence which is long and 
involved, but which works out with perfect precision. One 
reads such a sentence as this, which is longer than any that 
he would himself construct, with a feeling of a good deal of 
satisfaction that the author of the sentence has been able to 
extricate everyone concerned from the intellectual maze.
-P-A-G-E-200
190 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
Anyone who has struggled with the German language 
has an appreciation of the satisfaction which the novice feels 
in watching the way in which an expert in this language 
manages a separable verb. The moment the verb is used 
in a sentence, there arises a feeling of craving for the re- 
mainder of the verb. The skillful German places between 
the verb and the prefix a long series of phrases and words, 
but ultimately arrives with perfect precision at the end of 
the sentence, and gives the satisfaction which comes from a 
proper closing of the feeling which was started when the 
verb was first introduced. The learner is fully aware that 
he could not have carried the grammatical suspense forward 
as has the German expert, and the satisfaction at the final 
conclusion of the whole matter is the greater because he 
realizes how much the achievement surpasses any German 
of which he is himself capable. 
REACTIONS RELATED TO RHETORICAL FoRMS 
In the same way one follows a public speaker, when a 
climax is gradually being developed, with a kind of breath- 
less anxiety lest the climax should break down. If the 
climax is properly reached, there is a satisfaction which is 
very much greater than that which would be derived from 
hearing a rhetorical period which one is himself able to con- 
struct. The audience becomes more and more tense as the 
speaker moves to his conclusion ; and the satisfaction of this 
tense strain, if it is properly managed and properly brought 
to its consummation, may be of the highest type. 
In the case of a climax or of an elaborate paragraph the 
reaction and the experience are induced; that is, they did 
not originate with the auditor, but rather were taken on by 
him through a kind of imitation. Appreciation may thus 
be described as the: ability to follow a series of adjust- 
ments. Appreciation does not depend upon one’s ability
-P-A-G-E-201
THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ENGLISH COURSES 191 
as a performer, but rather upon one’s ability as an auditor. 
Illustrations of this ability to appreciate another’s perform- 
ance, even where one is himself not expert, can be seen in 
the way in which an audience will follow an expert singer. 
Anyone who has heard a high soprano note will understand 
what is meant by the statement that the audience appre- 
ciates performances which are far beyond any listener’s in- 
dividual possibilities. As the singer takes the high pitch 
which no member of the audience could imitate, there is an 
incipient tendency to draw one’s self together in a supreme 
effort to follow the note which is being produced. If, for 
any reason, the sound is not accurately produced, there is 
a violent reaction of disappointment, which is so obviously 
a physical reaction that one who has experienced it needs 
no argument to persuade him that appreciation in this case 
is a genuine physical matter. We have the same sort of 
sympathy with a person who is using the muscles of his 
arms and back in trying to lift a great weight. It is not 
necessary that we should lift the weight with him in order 
to have sympathy with what he is doing; it is enough that 
our eyes see him and our muscles grow tense in watching 
his efforts to lift the weight. 
RELATIONS OF ALL Emotions TO REACTIONS 
The reader who has never realized the importance of 
behavior in determining the character of individual con- 
sciousness has undoubtedly been growing more and more 
restless as the foregoing pages have omitted all mention of 
images and ideas and have set forth the relation of reac- 
tions to appreciation. This emphasis on reactions came 
into psychology with the James-Lange doctrine of the emo- 
tions. Before James wrote his great work ! the psychologies

and Company, 1890); Talks to Teachers on eae (Henry Holt 
and Company, 1902). 
 
-P-A-G-E-202
192 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
were utterly deficient in their treatment of emotions. There 
was a descriptive classification of emotions but no explana- 
tion of their character and conditions. James went further 
than any writers before him, and pointed out that it is evi- 
dent that emotions cannot be explained by the facts of 
sensation. When one enjoys looking at a certain shade of 
blue and is displeased with a certain shade of yellow, the 
pleasure and displeasure attaching to these colors cannot 
be explained by referring to the retinal processes involved. 
The sensations have quality and intensity, but the feeling 
tone is due to the reactions which they arouse. ‘The blue 
color makes the circulatory and respiratory organs act in a 
way wholly different from that in which they act during 
the observation of yellow. This doctrine worked out by 
James and Lange is an explanation of one group of mental 
processes which the sensory psychology could not deal with 
except in the most general descriptive terms. 
The theory of the emotions sketched above has influ- 
enced psychological thought in all directions. To-day we 
recognize that there are many aspects of experience other 
than emotions which can be understood only by the study 
of reactions. Space as an arrangement of sensations is the 
product of our efforts to organize our responses to sensa-_ 
tions. This was discussed in an earlier chapter. The facts 
of attention can be best understood when we refer to activ- 
ity. The individual who is concentrating on an object is 
turning all his motor processes in the direction of that 
object. The processes of discrimination are processes of 
varied response. In short, wherever sensations are organ- 
ized or arranged we are dealing with processes of behavior. 
The term “behavior” is not used in any large and loose 
sense. Behavior means bodily reaction and the nervous 
organization on which bodily reaction depends. The reason 
why right and left are so clearly distinguished is that these 
are sharply contrasted directions in which action may be
-P-A-G-E-203
THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ENGLISH COURSES 193 
turned. The reason why up and down are recognized as 
different is the same. The reason why we classify altruis- 
tic outgoing effort as opposed to narrow selfishness is to 
be explained by the motor attitudes which are attached to 
these contrasted words and ideas. : 
REACTION AND INDIVIDUAL INTERPRETATIONS 
oF Worps 
Another general topic which the psychology of behavior 
finds it very profitable to discuss is the problem of individ- 
ual differences. The same sound goes in at the ears of two 
different individuals. We have every reason to assume that 
each individual experiences a sensation essentially like that 
of all other human beings stimulated by the same sound, 
but how vastly different are the results of the two stim- 
ulations! The one individual hearing the sound remains 
unmoved and inactive; the other is aroused to the most 
strenuous endeavor. The one has no organized tendencies 
to react to the sound ; the other has. The experiences which 
arise in the two minds will reflect very little of the common 
sensation element present in both cases. No one would 
think of treating the two mental experiences as alike be- 
cause of the like sensory factors. The real character of 
each mental process depends, on the mode of response of 
which the individual is capable. It is the reaction side 
of human nature which is significant. 
The same conclusion appears when one studies the de- 
- velopment of an individual. The child and the man both’ 
see the same object, but the man knows what to do in the 
presence of the object and the child does not. Psychology 
and teaching are concerned with reactions; sensations are 
important only in so far as they arouse reactions. 
This long digression from our study of appreciation has 
perhaps served to persuade the reader to assume toward 
 
-P-A-G-E-204
194 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
language and language teaching an attitude different from 
that assumed in the conventional explanation of words 
as merely clues to mental pictures. Words are vital, sig- 
nificant facts in the mental world. We have word habits. 
We have modes of expression. We demand in all our con- 
tact with others that our habits of verbal reaction shall be 
conciliated. 
PsycHOLOGY OF STYLE 
Such general statements can be supplemented by further 
details. In colloquial speech with one’s familiar friends, 
one has a certain type of articulation and a certain set of 
familiar phrases. The moment one gets out of this friendly 
environment into a group of strangers one finds that his 
~» mode of articulation and his phraseology take on an en- 
tirely different character. He uses more dignified words, 
and he drops the familiar phrases which he used with his 
friends. One has, therefore, a style of familiar speech and 
a style of public address. One has a style for strangers 
and a style for friends. These are modes of behavior. 
In the same way one has a style of written expression 
which distinguishes itself sharply from his style of oral 
expression. In his autobiographical notes Herbert Spen- 
cer calls attention to the fact that he finds his practice 
of dictation leads to a diffugeness and looseness of style 
which was not exhibited in his earlier work, when he 
wrote his books with his own hand. This looseness of 
style in dictation is in part connected with the fact that 
‘one does not see the products of his work with the same 
degree of definiteness as when he is writing, but there is 
also the general fact that the words which issue from one’s 
vocal cords are different in character and in their con- 
nections from the words which one writes with a pencil or 
~> pen. The habits of expression in the two spheres of action 
are different.
-P-A-G-E-205
    THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ENGLISH COURSES 195 
Perhaps this difference in style can be most clearly illus- 
trated by the confession of a psychologist, who said that as 
a boy he had acquired the habit of profanity, but never 
made the mistake of using any of his profane phrases in 
his conversation at home. He did not have to stop and 
think each time he said anything at home that he must 
avoid profanity. He simply had a nonprofane style at 
home, whereas when he was associating with his compan- 
ions he had a style which included a free use of profane 
words. Later in life he resolved to give up the use of pro- 
fanity altogether. Then he found that his profane phrases 
crept into his conversation both at home and away from 
home. In other words, the profane phrases in this case 
crept in only when he did not detect them and eliminate 
them, and during this period of elimination they broke up 
his habits of expression both at home and away from home. 
Such examples of different kinds of style in different 
situations could be multiplied indefinitely. One has a 
serious style of address when he is engaged in one of his 
profound technical discussions, which serious style of ad- 
dress differs altogether from the style of address which he 
would use if he were discussing matters of business or pol- 
itics with his audience. Many an academic man realizes« 
that he can lecture very much better than he can write. 
His lectures are clear and explicit and attractive to the 
students whom he sees before him. The moment he loses 
the stimulus of the class environment and sits down with 
pencil and paper and tries to write out his ideas, he becomes 
heavy and unintelligible. On the other hand, there are 
many people who would be utterly at a loss to express 
themselves in oral speech. .If they were suddenly placed 
before an audience and called upon to express ideas, they 
would find the whole machinery of expression blocked. 
The only hope for such people is to write out what they 
have to say and then read it. Some people are able, when 
 
-P-A-G-E-206
    196 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
given this opportunity of writing out deliberately what they 
have to say, to prepare a fluent and coherent statement of 
the situation. They have a habit of written expression 
‘which is superior to their style of oral speech. 
_Continuity or Discourse A Mark oF Maturity 
Finally, one further illustration may be offered which 
distinguishes the trained individual from the untrained in- 
dividual. The trained individual feels the necessity of keep- 
_.ing up the continuity of thought and statement. He uses 
certain connective words and phrases which carry him over 
from sentence to sentence and from phrase to phrase. He 
uses at the beginning of a paragraph such a connective word 
as nevertheless or accordingly. The untrained thinker, on 
the other hand, omits most of these connective words. His 
ideas come in disconnected units. He does not feel the 
necessity of carrying the reader or his own discourse forward 
from phrase to phrase. He speaks in short, choppy sentences, 
and he is likely to use the wrong connective word if he tries 
to bridge over one of the chasms in his thought and expres- 
sion. Something analogous to this appears in the mature 
writings of a poet. It requires a high degree of develop- 
ment of the poetical art to bridge over the formal breaks 
in versification ; it is a mark of complete mastery of verse 
forms to adhere to the laws of division dictated by the 
meter and, at the same time, to carry forward the idea when 
need be beyond the line in such a way as to avoid gross 
inversion of speech and sharp breaks in sentences. 
SumMARY oF REACTION TO FoRM 
Enough has been said in these examples to make it clear 
that style grows through the accumulation of a great vari- 
~>ety of habits of speech and expression which cannot be
-P-A-G-E-207
  THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ENGLISH COURSES 197 
connected with single words, but which control the forma- 
tion of sentences and paragraphs. Furthermore, it has been 
made clear that the appreciation of these sentences and 
paragraph structures does not depend upon the ability of 
the individual himself to originate the forms of expression 
which he enjoys. Finally, attention can be called once 
more to the fact that in many cases the learning of one 
of these forms of sentence reaction is greatly facilitated 
by oral reading as distinguished from silent reading. The 
habits involved in appreciating matter which has only been 
seen are undoubtedly different in character from the habits 
involved in appreciating that which is expressed aloud. 
REACTIONS TO CONTENT 
Appreciation of rhythm, of structural facts, and of style 
constitute what we may call the pure forms of rhetorical 
appreciation. There is an entirely different sphere of 
appreciation. A literary passage is appreciated by the— 
trained reader for its content as well as for its form. 
Appreciation of content is in essence the same kind of a 
mental process as the appreciation of form. Content is en- 
joyed just in the degree in which the individual’s habits of 
reaction are satisfied by the impulses aroused by what he 
reads. Or to put the matter in a negative example, an indi- 
vidual can appreciate fully an emotion which is expressed 
in a poem only after he has had some of the real experi- 
ences capable of arousing in him modes of response appro- 
priate to the sentiment expressed in the poem. Take, for 
example, such a poem as Whittier’s “Barefoot Boy.” It is 
sometimes assumed that because this poem is about a boy it 
ought to be given to boys to read. It is assumed that boys 
will be aroused by the sentiment which the author experi- 
enced when he contrasted the boy and his simple surround- 
ings and possessions with the unhappy man of wealth who 
 
-P-A-G-E-208
  198 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
is deprived of all of the physical enjoyments which the 
barefoot boy enjoys. The fact is, of course, that an ordinary 
boy who has had the privilege of going barefooted has prob- 
ably never had the remotest approach to that emotional re- 
coil against luxury experienced by the man of wealth who 
rides by in his carriage. In other words, the barefoot boy can- 
not appreciate the discomforts of luxury which are described 
to him because the description arouses in him no response. 
In order to have the contrast which is in the poet’s mind, he 
must have had maturity of experience and the recoil of dis- 
appointment. To the ordinary boy no such contrast in expe- 
rience is possible. He sees the matter only from one uniform 
level of meager personal experience, and this leaves him with- 
out any possible appreciation of the author’s point of view. 
‘What has been said in connection with this example is 
frequently stated in discussions of appreciation when it is 
pointed out that one must have had some contact with life 
before he can fully comprehend the meaning of literature. 
Undoubtedly one must have cultivated certain forms of | 
emotional reaction and certain forms of interpreting expe- 
riences before he can know what ideas mean. It is not that 
_s one needs merely to know words, one must know how to 
7relate words to the larger experiences of life. Every indi- 
vidual word in the poem may be known to the barefoot 
boy. Every sentence may be capable of perfectly definite 
explanation, and yet one may have no appreciation what- 
soever of the sentiments which the phrases ought to bring 
up. The total situation is the mature product of many 
~ experiences. It is not even a matter of interpretation of 
a given sentence. There is undoubtedly a good deal of 
failure in the schools to appreciate this fact. We give 
literature to high-school students without any proper back- 
ing of personal experience to interpret the significance of 
the passage. The result is that the student’s mind is con- 
centrated upon the purely formal side of the passage. He
-P-A-G-E-209
  THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ENGLISH COURSES 199 
is absorbed in the words and in the sentences as they 
are presented on the page, and he fails to have any appre- 
ciation of the real significance of the passage because 
appreciation in this case means a response of a large and 
mature type. It would be very much better in such cases 
to find passages which can be related to reactions of which 
the learner is capable. Not that the passages should forever 
remain below the level of present experience, merely de- 
pending on the accumulations of the past to interpret what 
is now given; each passage read should refine the evalua- 
tions given to life’s contrasts; each passage should bring 
out some new analogy and some worthy difference. But 
these new contributions to experience must be close enough 
to that which the individual now has, so that a real relation 
may be established in the learner’s mind. Literary content 
must not merely be given. It must arouse a response. The 
student must feel the contrast or the agreement. He will 
thus be prepared to face in later life more elaborate com- 
parisons and more elaborate interpretations. He cannot, on 
the other hand, be prepared for the later appreciation of 
literature or for the relating of life and literature if the 
habits of mind which are cultivated in the school are for- 
mal habits of attention to words and sentences. A strict 
attention to the text in such cases as this is likely to per- 
vert rather than to aid the student’s literary development. 
He gets a bad habit of thinking of poems and of prose, 
passages as things in themselves, as groups of words, as oc- 
casions for barren rhetorical, grammatical, or analytical drill. 
STUDIES ABOUT SELECTIONS VERSUS APPRECIATION 
There is another perverted form of instruction which is 
very common in the schools. It assumes that students will 
get some notion of the meaning of passages by hearing 
about these passages and about their authors. There is
-P-A-G-E-210
200 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
undoubtedly some value in the information which is given 
in the history of literature, but the history of literature as a 
list of names is certainly not to be identified with training 
in appreciation of literature. To learn about the conditions 
under which a poem was written may indeed throw some 
light upon the significance of the author's mood and the 
meaning of the passage, but too frequently a statement 
about the conditions under which the poem was written 
becomes itself a remote and distracting subject of attention. | 
The student is distracted from the poem itself to think 
about a series of facts or statements which are of little or 
no value in promoting his interpretation of what he reads. 
DANGERS OF DISSECTION 
Formalism very frequently appears in another practice. 
The literary passage is dissected in such a way that each 
item of information which is presented is scrutinized and 
made the subject of long comment. Each individual para- 
graph is studied apart from its place in the total composi- 
tion. All of the allusions must be looked up, and the student 
becomes absorbed in the history of classical mythology 
rather than in the turn which is given to the passage by 
the reference to some classical story. This breaking up of 
a passage into its elements is very dangerous, because at- 
tention is in this case frequently drawn away from the real 
centers of emphasis. An allusion is frequently a remote 
suggestion of something that ought to be included in the 
thought rather than an appropriate subject for long discus- 
sions and attention. 
It is not denied that explanations and intelligent com- 
prehension of an allusion may be necessary. If the student 
does not know who Hercules was, it is sometimes necessary 
to study the whole myth in connection with the use of the 
single adjective “ Herculean” ; but what the student should
-P-A-G-E-211
THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ENGLISH COURSES 201 
carry away from this study of an allusion is the merest 
remnant of the whole story, the intellectual deposit of the 
discussion, rather than the long-drawn-out statement of the 
myth itself. Herculean means something large or strong 
or noble. That is what the student ought to be required 
to carry away from his study of classical mythology in this 
particular instance. He ought not to have to break upc- 
the passage the next time he reads it and go into a long 
discourse on all of the feats of strength which the hero 
accomplished, otherwise the flavor of the adjective will 
be lost in a didactic discussion of the information which 
came out of the classical dictionary. 
How English teachers expect to create appreciation of 
“Tvanhoe” or “ Miles Standish” by drilling into the student’s 
mind all of the details that can be looked up in commentaries 
and books of information is indeed difficult for an outsider 
to understand. The student gets the impression that the 
reading of one of these classics involves an encyclopedic 
inquiry into history and art. He loses the story itself in 
the multitude of explanatory considerations that are clus- 
tered about it. He is not encouraged to boil his experiences 
down to the point where they shall be mere interpretations 
of words. He is encouraged all the time to elaborate every 
word into a long and dreary series of explanatory ideas. 
INSTRUCTION IN APPRECIATION 
Perhaps the best antidote for formalism of the type 
which has been under discussion in the last paragraphs is 
to point out the fact that attention to form of expression is 
often the best possible means of securing appreciation of a 
passage. The writer recalls with grateful appreciation the 
skill with which his college teacher of English literature 
gave him a lesson in literary interpretation by compelling 
him to contrast two lines in Hamlet which were being read     
-P-A-G-E-212
  202 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
orally in class. In the fifth scene of the first act Hamlet, 
replying to the Ghost’s injunction “ Remember me,” says: 
Remember thee! 
Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat 
. In this distracted globe. Remember thee! 
Yea, from the table of my memory 
I'll wipe away all trivial fond records. 
The recurring exclamations “ Remember thee!” had been 
read in the first instance with the same intonation. The in- 
structor called attention to the desirability of distinguish- 
ing the two phrases in the two cases. Finally, the learner 
saw that the first “ Remember thee ” emphasized the word 
“remember,” the second the word “thee.” From that moment 
on the effort to interpret all the lines in the drama was of a 
wholly different type. The teacher had taught discrimina- 
tion. This discrimination was a matter of form; but it 
reacted on content, and content became significant and illu- 
minating from the moment the discrimination was clearly 
made: The study of what may be called internal form as 
distinguished from the study of external outstanding facts is 
shown by such an example to be productive in a high degree. 
This example could be multiplied by many another which 
would reénforce the general position defended all through 
this chapter, that appreciation is a matter of discriminat- 
ing reaction. There is no mystery about appreciation in 
a psychology which lays as much emphasis on reaction as 
it does on imagery. 
VARIETY AND COMPLEXITY OF APPRECIATIVE 
REACTIONS 
There is one question which has undoubtedly suggested 
itself to the mind of the reader who is not in sympathy with 
this type of psychology. Such a reader has doubtless noted 
that nothing very specific has been said about the actual
-P-A-G-E-213
THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ENGLISH COURSES 203 
muscular contractions which appear in the interpreting re- 
actions. What are the forms of muscular contractions which 
result from the reading of Milton’s “ Comus,” and how do 
they differ from the contractions induced by reading the 
jokes in the daily paper? The simple and straightforward 
answer to this question is that we do not know very much 
about these details. Probably there are vast individual dif- 
ferences which can be understood only when it is recognized 
that all the active habits of an individual are involved in 
any one act. These individual differences account for the 
highly subjective character of our tastes and appreciations, 
while at the same time they baffle the student who would 
give a general scientific explanation. 
Professor Sievers has of late been trying some interest- 
ing experiments in the reactions which connect themselves 
with literary appreciation. He sets be- 
fore the reader sharply contrasted pas- 
sages, one containing such adjectives 
as “narrow” and “straight,” the other 
full of suggestions of a broad horizon. 
With these passages are supplied certain visual figures, two 
_ of which are shown above. When the figure A is presented, 
with a passage about a narrow, straight path, the result is 
a reading of the passage with a reénforced tendency toward 
emphasis on the narrowness and straightness of the road. 
When, on the other hand, the reader looks at B and tries 
to read the passage about a narrow road, there is a curious 
feeling of incongruity and a strain in the act of reading. 
Professor Sievers explains this phenomenon as due to the 
induced muscular contractions in the trunk muscles which 
result from recognition of the figure. Converse results ap- 
pear when one uses the figures 4 and B with the passage 
referring to free space. 
These experiments suggest fruitful lines of investigation 
and, at the same time, supply the answer to our critical A B 
 
-P-A-G-E-214
204 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
reader. Our psychology has been so absorbed up to this 
time in the study of impressions that it has not dealt ade- 
quately with reactions. Hence we are not equipped with 
details. We are, however, supported in our generalizations 
by a growing body of evidence. 
DEVELOPMENT OF INTERPRETATIONS 
With this psychological analysis of literary appreciation 
we may turn to several of the practical implications of the 
doctrines which have been developed. In the first place, 
one realizes that literary appreciation depends upon the 
growth of experience. Little children cannot be expected 
to have very much literary appreciation. Their apprecia- 
tion is keen for such primitive characteristics as the rhyth- 
mic forms of speech. The content of the primitive rhythms 
most readily appreciated is a curious mixture of narrative 
and nonsense. The little child enjoys Mother Goose quite 
as much as he would enjoy a poem full of sound, wholesome 
moral doctrines, for in any case the content is subordinated 
to the rhythm. He enjoys the Mother Goose because it 
makes an appeal to his sense of rhythm and because the 
words arouse all sorts of familiar reactions in a confusing 
but stimulating medley. 
With the growth of more mature ideas there is an in- 
creasing emphasis on the reactions which are aroused by the 
content, but we cannot depend upon literature alone to 
create an appreciation of the larger experiences of life. We 
cannot depend upon any study of a verbal type to create a 
large appreciation of one’s social relations. One must have 
come in contact with social relations and must have seen his 
dependence upon his neighbors in such a way that he reacts 
to the whole social environment with some degree of intel- 
ligence before he can have a full appreciation of verbal state- 
ments which call attention to his contact with his fellows.
-P-A-G-E-215
  THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ENGLISH COURSES 205 
On the other hand, it should be recognized at once that 
verbal descriptions help the student to see the contrasting 
factors of his world of experiences. Point out to a childz 
that some acts are good and moral and others are bad and 
immoral, and he will forever after be more keenly aware of 
this contrast than he was before he received the instruction 
contained in those words. Words are themselves significant 
reactions, and one’s organization of experience depends on 
their use. Words help to mature one’s ideas of the world~ 
Literary appreciation is thus seen to be a developing agency. 
as well as a result. 
EXAMPLES AS MBANS OF LITERARY INSTRUCTION 
Another application of our studies is seen in the fact < 
that literature is a means of modifying one’s own mode of 
speech and writing. We must accordingly consider the re- 
lation of appreciation of the writings of others to one’s own 
modes of expression. It is a fundamental mistake to as- 
sume that a child must be able to produce a literary passage 
in order to appreciate it. Indeed, the mere shock of con- _ 
trast between what he would himself do in a given case ~ 
and what some writer has done for him is perhaps the most 
significant contribution which can be made to the student’s 
education. That student who is confronted day after day 
by his own productions is likely to find his habits of ex< 
pression and thought very much narrowed by this contact 
with his own work. Bad habits of expression become fixed, 
and the general level of mediocrity is established, from which 
there is no escape. If there is anything that composition 
has demonstrated in the schools, it is that students may be 
correct within the limits of their own possibilities of ex- 
pression and yet be most commonplace in all that they say 
and write. The teacher hardly knows how to tell the medi- 
ocre student what is wrong. What the teacher would like to
-P-A-G-E-216
  206 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
say to the student is, perhaps, something like this: “ Your 
sentences are all right, but they show no variety in form. 
There is no pleasing esthetic change in the modes of ex- 
pression. There is no spontaneity and change of temper 
from paragraph to paragraph. Get some variety into your 
writing.” A student thus addressed by a teacher would be 
wholly at a loss to know what is meant. He has laboriously 
hammered out one sentence after another, painfully express- 
ing the best that he had in each of these sentences, and now 
the teacher comes to him with the preposterous criticism 
that this is all right and yet worthless. What that student 
needs is to come in contact with somebody else and hear 
somebody else’s longer sentences and variety of expres- 
sion. He needs to be taken out of his own limited sphere 
of thought and language and introduced to a sphere of 
thought and language created by someone who has a 
broader experience and broader scope of language. The 
introduction of a student to this higher and more elaborate 
sphere of expression is attended by all sorts of difficulties, 
to which attention has been called. There is danger that 
he will be suddenly elevated into an atmosphere which he 
cannot breathe. He will fail to appreciate what he reads 
because it is so far beyond his comprehension that he is en- 
tirely lost in his efforts to understand the meaning of the 
passages before him. The teacher, in the meantime, being a 
person of wider experience and broader training, will have 
no sympathy with the inability of the student to react upon 
this larger body of ideas, or else he will become so accus- 
tomed to the immaturity of his students that he will him- 
self be dragged down to the level of the immature thought 
of his class. It is a pathetic sight to see some teacher of 
literature who probably once realized that “ Julius Cesar;’ 
\ was worth reading, trying to get this drama down to the 
point where it can at least be recited upon by his class. 
Teacher and students alike have lost all appreciation in
-P-A-G-E-217
THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ENGLISH COURSES 207 
the effort to cram the text into the narrow spaces which are 
furnished by the comprehension of the immature class and 
the bored teacher. 
TRAINING IN VERNACULAR MUST BE BROADENED 
Finally, the outcome of our study must be the conviction 
that the gravest problem of English teaching is to train inc_— 
the broad appreciation of all kinds of material, while at the 
same time we subject all kinds of materials to the refining ~— 
effects of literary formulation. The student will bring new 
ideas to the English class from the preceding recitation in 
science. The teacher ought to be able to utilize this experi- 
ence, and ought to send back to the science class the advan- 
tages which would come if the student knew how to express 
in clear, well-arranged sentences the findings of his scientific 
study. We have some experiments in this direction. 
The Cicero Township High School has a formulated 
series of requirements in English which are enforced in all 
classes. The author is indebted to Principal H. V. Church 
for the following series of “direction sheets” used in 
carrying out this plan.

REORGANIZATION IN DIRECTION OF GENERALIZATION 
These and like requirements are to be imposed on the 
science class and the mathematics class by the teachers of 
science and mathematics for the sake of clearness in science 
and mathematics. Such requirements are good and they 
generalize English in spite of the English teachers. 
On the other hand, the English teachers are induced in 
other high schools to require or allow science themes and 
history themes. This codrdination is usually opposed on
-P-A-G-E-220
210 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
both sides. The science and history teachers object that 
the English teachers do not understand the subject matter. 
The English teacher usually assents to the objection raised 
by the other departments, and adds the fact that all English 
teachers are overworked. The net result, after a spasm of 
correlation, is usually a smug and complacent retirement of 
English into its own peculiar field, while science and history 
turn to the task of cultivating subject matter, and inciden- 
tally requiring periods now and then at the end of sentences. 
The formula which suggests itself to the nonpartisan 
outsider is one of readjustment. Let us find someone bold 
enough to try the following experiment: Teach in one course 
the elements of form. Make it a good course, frankly dealing 
with sentence and paragraph structure. Then teach some 
of the history of literature, and train students to read, not 
dissect, some of the literary masterpieces. Then relieve 
the English department of further duties, so far as required 
work in the school is concerned. Take the time that would 
thus be saved and give it to history and science, but add the 
requirement that these courses be conducted in the English 
language, and not in the ejaculatory and explosive mono- 
syllabic pretenses at expression now commonly tolerated.

CHAPTER X 
FOREIGN LANGUAGES 
The psychologist experiences little or no difficulty in 
finding material for his discussions in the field of the 
teaching of foreign languages. From the earliest period of 
such instruction, teachers have discussed the principles of 
mental operation which underlie their methods. The psy- 
chologist could confine his efforts to a review of the various 
methods and of what has been said in support of them if it 
were not for the fact that there are such glaring disagree- 
ments in the statements made by language teachers that 
he is compelled to add critical comments to his reviews. 
\ METHOD OF THIS CHAPTER 
Our method of procedure in this chapter will accordingly 
differ from the method adopted in discussing mathematics 
and English. We shall examine critically certain of the 
more important discussions of the teaching of foreign lan- 
guages. We are forced to select from the great mass of 
material which is at hand, otherwise we should be led into 
too lengthy a treatment of this single field. The reader 
who wishes to go more fully into the history of these dis- 
cussions should take in hand some of the special discussions 
of methods in the classics 1 and modern languages.”

212 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
For our purposes it is not important that we should 
distinguish sharply between the classics and the modern 
languages. Since the more recent and more vigorous dis- 
cussions of methods relate to modern languages, we shall 
pay attention chiefly to these rather than to the classics. 
Before entering upon the discussion of methods it may 
be well to point out the urgent need of an impersonal, 
scientific study of our problem. Many recent discussions 
have been of a bitter partisan type. Particularly during the 
last fifty years, since Herbert Spencer made his pointed 
attack upon classical education, there has been exhibited, 
especially among those interested in the newer subjects, 
a very intolerant attitude toward foreign-language instruc- 
tion. The classics above all, and to some extent the 
modern languages, have been called upon to indicate the 
grounds on which they can properly maintain their position 
in the curriculum. 
GROUNDS URGED IN FAVOR OF REQUIRING LANGUAGES 
In answer to this challenge the defenders of the lan- 
guages have urged three justifications for their courses: 
first, languages are supposed to give a type of mental 
training which is advantageous quite apart from the con- 
tent which the text supplies; second, the study of a foreign 
language is said to be very advantageous in clearing up a 
student’s notion of his own language, both in matters of 
structure and in matters of vocabulary; finally, the study 
of a foreign language is supposed to be the means of bring- 
ing the student into contact with a culture other than that 
which he knows in his native land. 
The first two arguments are psychological in type and 
have been elaborately argued on both sides. Indeed, in a 
1F, W. Kelsey, Latin and Greek in American Education. The Mac- 
millan Company, 1911.
-P-A-G-E-223
  FOREIGN LANGUAGES 213 
very important sense the languages, because they are the 
subjects which have long held leading place in the curricu- 
lum, have had to take the brunt of a psychological discus- 
sion which is in reality very general in its scope. For 
example, the general doctrine that a subject may be studied 
with advantage quite apart from the content of the text is 
an argument that has been presented by every subject in 
the curriculum at some time or other. But the classics 
have presented this argument with such clearness and such 
force that they have become the center of the debate. The 
classics, more than any other subject, have been charged 
with support of the general doctrine of formal discipline. 
As a matter of fact, the natural sciences have assumed 
more commonly than the classics the validity of this prin- 
ciple of formal discipline. When one considers that the 
various sciences in the curriculum have been satisfied to 
give very short courses, on the theory that if a student 
were introduced to the methods of the science he would be 
able to carry these methods over into all sorts of situations 
that have not been canvassed in the class itself, one sees that 
the sciences have been assuming, in very large measure, 
that training given in a brief course will carry over into 
all sorts of varying situations. The advocates of sciences 
have been exultant in the recent criticisms of formal dis- 
cipline, and they have charged the classical languages with 
maintaining this doctrine in opposition to evidence, while 
these same advocates have tried to justify the position of 
the sciences in the school program by an appeal to the 
value of scientific method and to the training which their 
subjects give in observation and reasoning. These scientific 
critics of formal discipline very seldom make reference to 
Herbert Spencer’s argument regarding the formal value of 
science in his first essay on “ Education.” They write para- 
graphs that can be quoted, as we shall show later, in sup- 
port of the most extreme form of the doctrine of formal 
 
-P-A-G-E-224
    214 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
discipline, while they criticize the classics violently for the 
defense of what they regard as an antiquated and aban- 
doned theory. The general discussion of the doctrine of 
‘ormal discipline is of such importance that we shall devote 
a later chapter to this subject. For our present purposes it is 
enough to call attention to the fact that the languages have 
borne an undue share of this general discussjon just because 
they are in point of method and in point of pedagogical the- 
ory more mature than the other subjects of the curriculum. 
PARTISAN DISCUSSIONS OBSCURE IssUES 
With regard to the second and third arguments for 
language study it may be remarked that the truth is sadly 
obscured by the most violent partisan statements. In recent 
years English, as a special subject, has received so much 
attention in the course of study that there is less patience 
than there otherwise would be with the second argument. 
The third leads to enthusiastic comments on classical civ- 
ilizations on the one side and to the bitterest attacks on 
classical culture on the other. 
There is indeed a certain psychological phenomenon in 
the very partisanship which is here observed. The psychol- 
ogy of a violent reaction is always an interesting topic for 
the student of social life, and there can be no doubt that 
we have here a violent reaction. There was a time when 
the classical languages were so in control of the curriculum 
that there was no disposition to question the pedagogical 
wisdom of administering to every student a great deal of 
language instruction. It took generations of dissatisfaction 
with the methods employed in language instruction and 
with the results that come from this instruction to prepare 
the way for the attitude which many now assume toward 
the languages. Furthermore, after the storm began to rise, 
friends of the classics made what now appears to have been
-P-A-G-E-225
FOREIGN LANGUAGES 215 
a grave strategical blunder. They attempted by sheer ad- 
ministrative authority to require the languages, and thus 
they alienated those who otherwise would have been pre- 
pared to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of these 
subjects in a purely impersonal way. It must be admitted 
also that the friends of the classics have not been wise in 
their day and generation, for they have been slow to change 
their methods of teaching in such a way as to, meet the 
legitimate demands of the modern curriculum. The modern 
curriculum is not, as was pointed out in the introductory 
discussion, a series of courses intended for the student who 
is specializing with a view to entering the professions. The 
modern high-school course of study is offered to a very 
wide and cosmopolitan constituency. Whatever may have 
been true of the boys of the middle of the last century, it 
certainly is not true at the present time that every student 
will benefit by a long and rigorous course in the classics or 
in one of the foreign modern languages. Perhaps we shall 
find later, as we become more experienced in the adminis- 
tration of the type of high-school course which we now 
have, that brief courses in a great many different subjects 
are not the most desirable type of courses. But at the 
present moment such general courses are administered in 
practically every department except the languages. Stu- 
dents certainly have a right to ask, at the end of a year 
of work in any subject, that they carry away something 
that is of real importance in their intellectual development. 
Language teachers, accustomed to having a major place on 
the school program, are very intolerant of any suggestion 
that they ought to give the student something that is 
of real intellectual value in so short a period as a single 
year. This unwillingness of the language teachers to ac- 
commodate their subjects in any wise to the general spirit 
of the modern curriculum is undoubtedly disadvantageous 
to their subject. 
 
-P-A-G-E-226
  216 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
GENERAL CouRSES DESIRABLE 
We shall have occasion later to point out that there are 
possibilities in language study of a generalized treatment 
of language which would be very useful to a student who 
does not intend to read the language with success or to 
become directly acquainted with its literature. But such a 
generalized course in language requires the highest type of 
genius on the part of the instructor and on the part of the 
department which is to organize it.1 Teachers of language 
have very seldom seen the possibilities of such a language 
course. It is to be reiterated that such language courses are 
at least thinkable, and for the sake of their own depart- 
ments teachers should give them careful consideration. If 
the languages would make a genuine effort to interest stu- 
dents by. putting in the foreground some of the general 
principles of language structure, thus using the rich body 
of material which is known to comparative philology, there 
can be no doubt at all that much of the prejudice against 
the long courses which are now required as the only means 
of studying language would tend to disappear. Further- 
more, if the administrative device of trying to bolster up 
the languages by requirements of a type which none of 
the other subjects adopt were abandoned by the defenders 
of these subjects, there can be no doubt that the general 
emotional tone of the educational world toward language 
instruction would be materially modified. 
We must, however, come back from this digression into 
the psychology of social reactions and devote ourselves to 
the psychology of foreign languages. It is to be hoped that 
the purpose of this digression will be served, in that the 
reader will be prepared to lay aside prejudices either for or 
1 Indirectly the report of the Joint Committee on Grammatical No- 
menclature is of interest to the advocate of such a generalized course.

against language instruction and devote himself for a time 
to the single problem, What are the psychological problems. 
involved in such instruction ? 
REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF TWELVE 
Turning to the various methods which have been sug- 
gested for language teaching, we find an excellent sum- 
mary in the report of the Committee of Twelve of the 
Modern Language Association of America. This report was 
presented to the Modern Language Association in 1898. It 
was reported also to the National Education Association.! 
GRAMMATICAL METHOD 
The first method which is discussed in this report is the 
grammatical method. When this method is followed, a 
series of paradigms are presented to the student before he » 
is introduced to sentences or to the study of a consecutive 
text. After mastering a number of the forms, the student 
is introduced to the simple rules of syntax, and sentences 
illustrating these facts of syntax are constructed out of the 
words which he has encountered. He is also required to 
translate simple sentences from the vernacular into the 
foreign language. This again is for purposes of illustrating 
the rules of syntax which are given to him in the gram- 
mar. Finally, after a considerable period the student is 
allowed to read some of the classics of the foreign lan- 
guage; but the reading is slow, and a good deal of attention 
is given to the parsing of words, with a view to training 
the student in the details of grammatical structure.

-P-A-G-E-228
  
  218 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
The Committee of Twelve presents arguments for and 
against this method. “It trains the mnemonic faculty. . . . 
The careful study of grammatical rules and their nice 
application in translation and composition form one of the 
best possible exercises in close reasoning.” 
These two arguments in favor of the method hardly need 
to be restated in psychological form. They both assume that 
certain mental powers need to be trained, without reference 
to the content of the text which is being read. We have 
had occasion in an earlier connection to comment on the 
present-day attitude toward memory work. In referring to 
some of the discussions in mathematics, it will be remem- 
bered that it was pointed out that at the present time there 
is a violent reaction against the view that the memory ought 
to be trained. Furthermore, since William James wrote his 
chapter on memory,! grave question arises against any view 
which assumes that the training of the memory in one field 
aids memory in other fields of experience. 
The second argument in favor of the grammatical method 
is purely and simply an argument in favor of formal disci- 
pline, and we can dispose of the matter by referring forward 
to a later special chapter on this subject. 
Against the grammatical method the Committee of 
Twelve argues that it omits “the broadening of the mind 
through contact with life... and the cultivation of the 
artistic sense by the appreciative study of literary master- 
pieces....” Furthermore, the grammatical method fails to 
stimulate and maintain the interest of students. 
We are led in the first of these arguments against the 
grammatical method back to one of the general contentions 
in favor of the study of foreign language. As pointed out 
above, when advocates defend foreign languages in the 
secondary-school course, on the ground of the value of 
1 Principles of Psychology, Vol. I, chap. xvi, especially pp. 663 ff. 
Henry Holt and Company, 1890.
-P-A-G-E-229
  
FOREIGN LANGUAGES 219 
the content of texts, we are dealing with an argument 
that is not psychological in its character, and we need not 
take it up in any detail. 
PsycHoLocy oF INTEREST 
The contention that the grammatical method does not 
maintain interest is so general that if one attempts to sub- 
ject it to a psychological analysis, he is led into the broad 
and somewhat vague discussions which characterize the 
Herbartian pedagogy. This pedagogy emphasized interest 
as one of the most important psychological concepts for the 
teacher. The conflicting interpretations that have been put 
on the Herbartian doctrine of interest justify us in passing 
on to more definite problems without any attempt to revive 
the discussions that center about this word. 
ANALYSIS AS A PRopuct or LANGUAGE STUDY 
The discussion of the grammatical method brings us into 
one of the very general problems of education. Every 
mental process involves a certain degree of analysis. The 
analysis of spatial experiences was fully illustrated in an 
earlier chapter. 
Grammatical studies are analytical studies. The sentence 
is taken apart and its various elements and their relations 
are examined in detail. The question which confronts the 
teacher is not, Should analysis be made? for sooner or 
later the sentence will be analyzed by any careful reader. 
The question is rather when and how shall the analysis be 
made. As to when, it is now very generally agreed that 
students should not be called on to analyze any body of 
experience until they have in their own minds some ex- 
amples of the matter which is to be analyzed. Further, 
it is agreed that complete analysis is the function of the 
mature mind rather than of the child’s’ mind. 
 
-P-A-G-E-230
    220 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
REACTION ON VERNACULAR 
We may therefore argue that analysis of grammatical 
structures is very properly a function of education at its 
higher levels. One of the advantages of studying a foreign 
language is that such a language lends itself more readily 
to a scientific study than does the vernacular. The point 
of view which one has toward his vernacular is an intimate 
unanalytical point of view; he is not explicitly aware of 
the fact that language has structure. He never takes a 
view of his native tongue from what might be called the 
outsider’s point of view. He is always using this language, 
and its structural peculiarities seem to him to be so natural 
that they seldom arouse in his mind any questions. If now 
the school can, through instruction in foreign language, 
develop a wholly new point of view with regard to lan- 
guage, it will certainly contribute to the student’s training. 
Hence, as is often pointed out, a foreign language is the 
best instrument with which to teach English grammar. 
The abstractness of English grammar as it was taught 
a generation ago in the upper grades of the elementary 
schools has led to an abandonment, for the most part, of 
that type of study. Some substitute for this old-fashioned 
abstract grammar certainly must be found, and one of the 
difficulties in finding a substitute arises from the fact that 
English has so little structure of its own, either in inflection 
or in the principles under which its sentences are put to- 
gether, that it is difficult to give a student the notions of 
language structure through the use of our highly simplified 
language. Furthermore, as stated above, the analytical point 
of view is not easy to assume. 
If now we can use a foreign language as a basis of 
comparison and can, at the same time, give the essential 
principles of this foreign grammar, we shall gain a double 
advantage, because the student from the outset can assume
-P-A-G-E-231
  FOREIGN LANGUAGES 221 
toward the foreign language an entirely different attitude 
from that which he takes toward his own tongue. When 
the advantages of teaching foreign language are finally 
formulated by teachers of language, this argument for a 
clear understanding of the structure of the vernacular will 
doubtless survive as one of the most important reasons for 
teaching foreign languages. 
ANALYTICAL ATTITUDE NATURAL TO ADULTS 
Two further comments suggest themselves: first, an adult 
who is attacking a foreign language for the first time will 
naturally assume from the outset an analytical attitude 
toward the study because much of his training has made 
him analytical in his habits of thought; second, a foreign 
language might be used for the purpose of training the 
student in analysis without carrying him very far into a 
reading or speaking command of the language. The ar- 
gument for such scientific studies of language will be 
presented more fully after we have canvassed other con- 
tributing lines of thought. 
NaturRAL METHOD 
The foregoing discussion has anticipated in a measure 
the treatment of the second method of teaching foreign 
languages discussed by the Committee of Twelve; namely, 
the natural method. The fundamental teaching of this 
method is that the adult should acquire a foreign language 
in the same way that a child masters his mother tongue. 
In criticism of this method the Committee calls attention 
to the fact that the advocates of the natural method “ over- 
look, first, the fact that the child requires eight or ten years 
of incessant practice to gain even a tolerable command of 
his own tongue, and, secondly, the vast difference between 
 
-P-A-G-E-232
222 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
the mind of the baby and that of the youth.” To show the 
difference between the mature and immature mind the Com- 
mittee considers the facts of pronunciation, calling attention 
to the observation that a little child learns by imitation, 
while the boy of maturer years does not imitate, but rather 
selects from the stock of acquired modes of pronunciation 
one which he applies to the present situation. 
This illustration is a very suggestive one from the point 
of view of psychological analysis. Undoubtedly the authors 
of the Committee’s report had in mind the contentions of 
those who have, of late, been describing the phonetic method 
of teaching the pronunciation of foreign languages. Per- 
haps the simplest way of reénforcing their statement that 
there is a difference in the mode of learning pronunciation 
in the later stages of life is to repeat a paragraph published 
by a recent writer in the School Review. 
PRONUNCIATION ; IMITATION VERSUS PHONIC ANALYSIS 
In the November, 1913, School Review, M. Locard has an 
article entitled “ French in the Public High Schools.” In try- 
ing to demonstrate that conversational French is inadvisable, 
M. Locard affirms: “It seems rational to say that French 
nationality, backed by education and experience, is the absolute 
requisite for any person who claims to teach French. A Ger- 
man, an American, a Japanese may have mastered the language 
to some extent, but with few exceptions, the standard of his 
pronunciation will always be below that of any mature French- 
man.” Thus are we to conclude that the requisite for teaching 
French pronunciation is a good pronunciation? The French 
nation, as regards the teaching of English and German, has 
answered this question in the negative. In Paris the teaching 
of English is intrusted to Frenchmen. In visiting eight of the 
largest French lycées I met but one native English teacher, and 
she was permitted to teach permanently only because she had 
been naturalized. French is taught in Germany by Germans 
“LA, G. Bovee, School Review, June, 1914, Vol. XXII, No. 6, p. 417. 
 
-P-A-G-E-233
  FOREIGN LANGUAGES 223 
with most excellent results. Professor Walter of Frankfurt, 
who evidently does not talk like a Frenchman, succeeds in get- 
ting a very superior pronunciation from his pupils. Professor 
Vietor of Marburg gives his students of English a pronunciation 
which is almost impeccable. We fear that M. Locard’s state- 
ment will scarcely bear comprehensive examination. Pronun- 
ciation is not contagious; a little knowledge of the science of 
phonetics easily turns the balance against the native teacher. 
Then, too, the native teacher is generally entirely lacking in 
any scientific preparation for this work. 
Put into psychological terms this statement means that 
the control of the vocal cords and of the other organs of 
articulation can be learned by finding out in detail the 
various positions which these organs should assume with 
reference to each other when one makes a sound. The child 
does not know anything about his organs, and consequently 
has only one possible way of learning to make sounds. He 
must try a variety of experiments and must, through ex- 
perimentation and close attention to adults about him, 
ultimately learn their methods of making sounds through 
sheer trial and error. The adult, on the other hand, is fully 
equipped with mature habits of making sounds. If these 
mature habits are not counteracted by some explicit correc- 
tive method, there is grave danger that the learner’s attention 
will never be turned to the example of his teacher, and that 
he will not be docile enough in his trials and errors to assure 
any modification of his own natural method of producing re- 
lated sounds. The more mature the learner, the worse he is 
as an imitator. The concrete cases cited above by Mr. Bovee 
go to show that the phonetic study of sounds has great ad- 
vantages for mature students and mature teachers as con- 
trasted with the purely imitative method advocated by those 
who defend the natural method of teaching foreign lan- 
guages. The whole argument is psychologically sound and 
shows clearly one of the fallacies of the natural method.
-P-A-G-E-234
  224 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
ForreigN LANGUAGE AS THE MEDIUM oF INSTRUCTION 
There is one other characteristic of the natural method 
which has from time to time reappeared in the later methods. 
It is insisted by advocates of the natural method that only 
the foreign language which is the subject of instruction 
shall be used by the teacher and by the student. The em- 
phasis which is laid on the foreign language in this and 
other methods is a matter of psychological interest. 
From the point of view of the use of the foreign lan- 
guage as an instrument for reading the literature of that 
language, there can be no doubt at all that the student 
should ultimately reach the stage which will make it un- 
necessary for him to translate each word into his own 
vernacular. Even those who lay great stress upon the 
translation method would undoubtedly recognize the ad- 
vantage of this kind of acquisition of a foreign language. 
It might be argued that such a mastery of the foreign lan- 
guage is seldom attained in the schools, and consequently 
there will be many teachers who will feel justified in giving 
up from the outset any hope of attaining this desirable 
end. They will insist that the advantages of a translation 
knowledge are great enough to justify the teaching of a 
foreign language in the school curriculum, and that there 
is accordingly no need of insisting on the use of foreign 
words in instruction. 
TRANSLATION AS THE METHOD oF INSTRUCTION 
The student of psychology finds himself in the position 
of accepting both views. If one can get a reading knowl- 
edge of the language, that is good; if one must translate, let 
him do so with diligence. The psychology of the two cases 
is different. Let us therefore take note of the statements 
made by the opposing parties.

                                       The proper opinion among those who have not thought the 
matter over, or who have not given sufficiently careful atten- 
tion to their own mental processes is that a foreign language 
can be understood only by transposing it into one’s mother 
tongue; but this is not so. Those who read foreign authors in 
the original with real advantage do not actually first translate 
each word, still less each sentence or each period, into English 
before they proceed further.’ (P. 48.) 
Our ideal must rather be the nearest possible approach to the 
native’s command of the language so that the words and sen- 
tences may waken the same idea in us as in the native —and 
these ideas, as we well know, are not the same as those called 
forth by the corresponding words in our own language. (P. 54.) 
For all these reasons, it is not translation (or skill in 
translation) that we are aiming at in teaching foreign lan- 
guages. (P. 55.) 
Contrast with these statements by Jespersen the dictum 
of Lowell quoted by Bennett.? 
In reading such books as chiefly deserve to be read in any 
foreign language, it is wise to translate consciously and in words 
as we read. There is no such help to a fuller mastery of our 
vernacular. It compels us to such a choosing, and testing, to 
so nice a discrimination of sound, propriety, position, and shade 
of meaning, that we now first learn the secret of the words we 
have been using or misusing all our lives, and are gradually 
made aware that to set forth even the plainest matter as it 
should be set forth is not only a very difficult thing, calling 
for thought and practice, but is an affair of conscience as well. 
Translation teaches, as nothing else can, not only that there is 
a best way, but that it is the only way. Those who have tried 
it know too well how easy it is to grasp the verbal meaning of 
a sentence or of a verse. That is the bird in the hand. The 
real meaning, the soul of it, that which makes it literature and 
not jargon, that is the bird in the bush, which tantalizes and

stimulates with the vanishing glimpses we catch of it as it flits 
from one to another lurking-place : 
Et fugit ad salices et se cupit ante videri. 
The psychologist has two comments to offer. First, the 
two kinds of mental processes sought by these two oppos- 
ing views are radically different. Second, which is better in 
any given social situation depends on considerations that are 
not psychological. For example, if a student has just one 
year in which to get all the knowledge of German that he 
is going to get, the social situation is very different from 
that which confronts teacher and student when the latter 
expects to take German four years in succession. Those 
language teachers who oppose translation to direct knowl- 
edge of the foreign language should realize that both are 
psychologically possible, but that one or the other can be 
more advantageously sought under given conditions. 
THE PsycHoLtogicAL MrrHop 
The third method which is discussed in the Report of the 
Committee of Twelve is the so-called psychological method.! 
There are two distinct characteristics of this method: first, 
the word is learned in close association with the object to 
which it refers and much emphasis is laid on sensory expe- 
riences as giving words their value and meaning; second, 
all words are acquired as parts of short sentences, these 
sentences being at the outset of the study very simple, 
and gradually increasing in complexity until the student is 
able to read any miscellaneous text in the foreign language. 
The first contention of the method — that words should be 
associated with objects — is to be viewed most critically, 
1 For a full discussion of this method see articles by R. Kron in Die 
neueren Sprachen, Vol. III, 1896. For a discussion of the first Cisrecan 
istic, see especially p. 10; the second is also fully illustrated. :

especially in the form in which it is commonly presented. 
The principle of sentence study and serial progression is 
in keeping with the best tendencies of recent educational 
methodology. 
IMAGERY 
In discussing the requirement of the psychological 
method, that objects or images be associated with words, 
the Committee of Twelve makes the following statement: 
On presenting each new word to the beginner, the instructor 
exhorts him to close his eyes and form a distinct mental pic- 
ture of the thing or act represented. This image (it is affirmed) 
will remain indissolubly connected with the word, and the evo- 
cation of the one will always recall the other. Sometimes real 
objects or drawings are used, and pantomime is frequently 
resorted to; but in most cases reliance is placed on the child’s 
active imagination. 
Direct SENsoRY AND Motor PROCESSES 
One of the recent writers! says: 
Another cardinal doctrine of the reformers is the belief that 
the more direct the connection established between the thing 
and its name, the more direct the association between an idea 
and its expression, the more permanent and effective it will 
be.... Pantomime, gesture, bodily movement, impressions 
made by concrete objects upon the various senses, all sorts of 
devices are employed to enable the instructor to dispense with 
the vernacular. (Pp. 476, 477.) 
The use of Realien constitutes a valuable adjunct to this 
method of instruction, In addition to the well-known and 
widely used pictures of the seasons by Hoelzel, upon which 
conversation may be based, whatever tends to throw light upon 
the material and spiritual life of the nation whose language is 
being studied receives a hearty welcome. (Pp. 478, 479.)

    228 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
In the latter part of this article the author argues that 
because brain physiology has shown that several different 
centers, especially those of hearing and vision, are involved 
in the cerebral processes connected with speech that it is de- 
sirable to arouse to action, in the course of language study, 
as many of these centers as possible. 
A like discussion is to be found in an article published 
in Science.’ 
Physiological psychology teaches us that four distinct centers 
of the brain are active in the acquisition of language; namely: 
the auditory, the visual, the motor writing, and the motor speech 
centers, the first two sensory, the latter two motor. The function 
of the auditory center is to receive sensory impressions through 
the nerves of the ear; that of the visual center to receive im- 
pressions from the nerves of the eye; the motor-writing center 
controls the muscles of the hand in writing, while the motor 
speech center controls the muscles of the speech organs... . 
Without going into the old question whether sensation is 
the sole principle of knowledge, we are on safe ground psycho- 
logically when we assert that in learning a language auditory, 
visual and kinesthetic sensations play the most important réle, 
and are in fact the basis of knowledge. It follows then that 
‘the greater the number of sensory impressions that can be en- 
listed in the acquisition of language, the greater the acquisition. 
It follows also that the more combined the activity of the senses, 
the more rapid and the more thorough will be the organization 
of the speech centers physically and psychically. . | 
Thus the argument which is often used against the ‘analytical : 
or direct method that adults do not learn language like children 
do loses much of its force. Certain it is that for adults the | 
idea comes before the sign for the idea, although, to be sure, | 
the mature mind, accustomed to abstract thinking, soon de- 
mands that it be given not only the percepts but the concepts, | 
and the general concepts as well. 
Good pedagogy should call into activity all the powers of 
the mind of the learner. Thus in the case of the language

     teacher, to utilize the visual and the graphic centers only, and 
allow the auditory and the motor speech centers to lie barren, 
is to get only a portion of the sensory impression that may be 
got if all the centers are utilized. 
Again, since some individuals of a group will learn better 
by the utilization of the visual and the graphic centers, others 
by the utilization of the auditory and the motor-speech centers, 
etc., every course in language should give opportunity for both 
forms of impression and both forms of expression, that is, for 
hearing, and seeing (reading); for speaking and writing. 
Language study is best cultivated by utilizing the nerv- 
ous energy of all four centers, that is, the ear, the eye, the 
vocal organs and the hand. Each must support the other, thus 
heightening the total impression. 
Generalizations, in this case principles and laws, must base 
upon sense perceptions, in this case spoken or written words 
and phrases, and must follow, not precede them. 
Finally, an example may be quoted from the notes taken 
at the conference at Sorbonne by Charles Schweitzer.1 
Take, for example, the word “apple.” In learning his native 
tongue the French child sees the fruit placed before him on the 
table or suspended from the tree. At the same time some one 
pronounces to him the word “apple” and accompanies the pro- 
nunciation of this word by a gesture. After the experience 
has been repeated several times an indissoluble association is 
formed between the two percepts, one a visual percept and the 
other an auditory percept. An equation is set up in the mind 
of the child between the word “apple” and the image of an 
apple. The two members of this equation form so intimate an 
association that the image of the object will invariably call 
up the word and that which the word was intended to intro- 
duce, namely, the image of the object.

  230 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
CRITICISM OF “IMAGERY” AND “SENSATION” DocTRINES 
These quotations show how much emphasis the psycho- 
logical method has laid upon the images which reproduce 
sensations and which all learners are supposed to form of ob- 
jects when they begin to acquire the words of a language. 
Enough has been said in an earlier discussion of the nature 
of language to make it clear that this conception which lays 
stress upon the images associated with words is true only 
in a very limited way, if, indeed, it is true at all. Doubtless 
the mind does carry certain images of the objects for 
which we have names in mature life, but these images are 
very vague and very general. Let one test himself, for ex- 
ample, to see how exact and complete is his image related 
to any object which he may know by name. For example, 
suppose one hears the word “ animal” or the word “ verte- 
brate” and asks himself how fully these familiar words are 
paralleled in his experience by images that could be sub- 
jected to any careful analysis. If our adult images are vague 
and indefinite even in a field where popular science has done 
much to make ideas clear, it is much more the case that a 
child’s images are vague and indefinite. One has only to 
observe a child in the early stages of his acquisition of 
language to realize the truth of this statement. He uses 
words in a broad, general way. For example, any sort of 
liquid will be called “water,” not because the word calls 
up any definite idea of a particular substance but rather 
because all of the various substances are enough alike to 
fit into his loose, general imagery. In the same fashion, 
the word “horse” is not used by the child in any sharply 
defined way so as to distinguish one of the larger animals 
from the rest, which resemble it in gross outline; the child 
uses the word to refer to any large object, even applying 
it to his playthings which have no sensory likeness to the 
animal at all.
-P-A-G-E-241
  FOREIGN LANGUAGES 231 
The evidence from the study of the child’s vocabulary 
is reénforced by a study of his efforts to reproduce im- 
ages. The moment he begins to draw he exhibits with 
perfect clearness the fact that his images are not sharp and 
definite; they are vague and symbolic—that is, a few 
irregular lines stand in his mind for some object suchas 
man or animal, and there is no possibility, until his mental 
development has gone much further, of his refining these 
crude images so as to make them resemble at all closely 
the objects for which they stand in his thinking. The child’s 
mental attitudes toward the world are dominated by his 
own personal feelings and by his own attitudes of reactions 
toward the world. He likes things or dislikes them with 
great intensity. He does not make any careful analysis of 
their form or external characteristics. What is true of his 
images is true of his words. These words are significant 
to him not because they are associated with the external 
characteristics of objects such as the form and color of 
these objects; they are significant rather because they call 
up in his experience certain attitudes of mind and body 
which he has learned to assume toward the objects which 
are being designated. 
REAcTION EssENTIAL TO INTERPRETATION 
When, therefore, the psychological method of teaching 
foreign languages begins to lay great emphasis upon sensory 
aspects of language, it fails to in- 
clude the most essential facts in g ———— 7 
the situation. Perhaps this can be 
made clear by the use of a series of simple diagrams. Let 
us represent an external object as it impresses the indi- 
vidual by the letter O. The letter Z will be used to rep- 
resent the individual who is brought in contact with this 
object. A line connecting O and J will represent the R
-P-A-G-E-242
    232 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
impression which is produced upon the individual by this 
external object. A line issuing from J in a direction oppo- 
site to that from which the impression came represents the 
reaction of the individual upon the object. This reaction 
may be an emotional reaction, as when an individual is 
afraid of the object which. he sees; or it may be a reaction 
of the hand and arm, as when an individual seeks to grasp 
the object. In any case the reaction is an expression of the 
individual’s organization rather than a matter of impression 
from the object. 
The little child gets an impression from the object, but 
this is by no means the important part of the whole situa- 
tion from the psychological point of view. Much more 
significant is the reaction which issues from the child. At 
the outset these reactions on the part of the child are few 
in number and simple in character. As he develops, how- 
ever, there come to be a great variety of them, among which 
are the reactions of the vocal cords. We can now represent 
the second stage of our psychological analysis by showing 
that the impression received 
R* py the child may issue in a, 
  ie a : variety of different forms of 
oO I et. R* reaction. These are repre- 
Sad sented by the three reaction 
~ lines that issue from Z These 
different types of reaction have 
more or less connection with each other. The result is that 
when an object calls for one form of reaction, it tends at 
the same time to call up other forms of reaction. Certain 
cross associations begin to set themselves up between the 
different types of reaction. This we might represent by 
drawing cross lines between the different R’s that were 
indicated in the second diagram. At the same time a new 
type of impression begins to act upon the individual. This 
is the auditory impression which comes to him from his own
-P-A-G-E-243
FOREIGN LANGUAGES 233 
reactions of articulation and from the words which are pro- 
duced by those who are about him. We may set down, 
therefore, in the third dia- 
WwW gram two incoming sensory 
R* impressions; namely, the 
a Sts ae ; original type of impression 
oO ee F" O and the new type of im-   
Lape pression W. W,in turn, gets 
its meaning not merely by 
virtue of the fact that it 
is connected with O, but more from the fact that it is con- 
nected with the various forms of reaction which constitute 
the individual’s reaction to 
O. Indeed, after O has led Ww 
to the organization of FR}, a 
R, and R, these may at- T 
tach directly to W, as when 
one reacts to the cry of danger rather than to the sight of 
a dangerous object. The interpretation of a word is there- 
fore an elaborate product of development, depending quite 
as much upon the R’s as upon 0. 
In their emphasis upon objects, the natural method and 
the psychological method lay great stress on the connec- 
tion of the word with O, but they overlook the importance 
of all of the & elements which enter into the interpretation 
of words. From what has been said in an earlier chapter 
which deals with the nature of language, the absurdity of 
this overemphasis is apparent. R 
Many Worps INCAPABLE OF SENSORY INTERPRETATION 
Furthermore, one might derive from the study of words 
much evidence in support of the general psychological con- 
clusion which was reached in the earlier chapter. One needs 
very little contact with the language to note that there 
 
-P-A-G-E-244
  
  234 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
are many words for which it is quite impossible to have 
any images whatsoever. Prepositions, for example, and 
connective words obviously cannot have any imagery which 
could be made the basis of interpretation. All sorts of 
abstract words fall into the same class. It should be noted 
that there is no denial in all of this discussion of the 
presence or value of imagery in certain psychological con- 
ditions; but it should be reiterated here, as it was in the 
chapter on the nature of language, that very often, especially 
in the higher forms of experience, imagery is a hindrance 
rather than a support to thought. Words are superior to 
images for the higher thought-processes. They come to be 
substitutes for the images of objects; and it is distinctly 
uneconomical for a trained individual to attempt to carry 
in his mind any long train of images — it is much simpler 
for him to use words as actual substitutes for the objects, 
and to depend upon his trained reactions associated with 
these words to guide him in his thought, rather than to go 
back to the primitive forms of imagery out of which his 
interpretations may, in some cases, have originated. 
REACTIONS REFINE IMAGES 
Furthermore, even when we study mental imagery it can 
be shown that reactions are more important than impressions 
in determining the character of the memory picture which 
we carry away from the objects about us. If we want to 
know the details of form in an object, we set ourselves the 
task of reproducing it in a drawing or by carefully tracing 
its outlines through reactions. - Even the verbal reactions 
can be described as our most potent instruments for induc- 
ing and supporting analysis of images. Consider, for ex- 
ample, the fact that the botanist is able to train his students 
-in the observation of plants through the development of a 
series of names of the different parts of the plant. When  
-P-A-G-E-245
FOREIGN LANGUAGES 235 
a child looks at a plant, before he has had any scientific 
training whatsoever, he sees the characteristics only in a 
broad, general way. There is no practical motive for a 
discrimination of the different parts. There is no reaction 
to these different parts which would tend to distinguish 
one part from another. For purposes of scientific study a 
terminology is created which constitutes a kind of artificial 
reaction to the different parts of the object. The individual 
is now equipped with the motives and with the psychologi- 
cal devices to aid him in his discriminations. He reacts 
with one word to one part of the object, and with an en- 
tirely different word to another part of the plant, with the 
result that he recognizes the different parts of the plant 
and gives to each enough attention to distinguish it in the 
percept and in the memory from the other parts which are 
differently named. These sharp distinctions of science may 
later be used for practical purposes, but they are commonly 
cultivated as scientific distinctions before practical life 
takes them up and makes use of them. We shall have 
occasion later to call attention to the difference between 
the motives that grow out of verbal discriminations and 
the motives which appear in practical life for the analysis 
and discrimination of the parts of objects. For our present 
purposes it is enough, with the aid of this example, to have 
called attention to the fact that words and verbal reactions 
are among the important means employed in intellectual 
development for the analysis of impressions themselves. 
A body of impressions which has been thus analyzed through 
the use of discriminating words is a much more highly 
refined experience than any which presents itself to the 
mind before verbal reactions were developed. Furthermore, 
the introduction of the child to all those distinctions which 
society has found to be important is rendered easy through 
language. Words are therefore means of transmitting dis- 
tinctions as well as means of establishing them. 
   
-P-A-G-E-246
  236 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
Mature DIscRIMINATIONS DEPEND ON WorpDs 
We are now prepared for the final criticism of the so- 
called psychological method of teaching foreign languages. 
The most important characteristic of a mature mind is that 
its discriminations as well as its contents are determined 
in great measure by words. Words constitute the chief 
instruments of thought and of reaction upon all things. 
A man reacts with words to most of the situations of life. 
Even when he is thinking to himself he uses words. If 
a mature person tries now to acquire a foreign language, 
he cannot possibly go back to the supposedly primitive 
stage when impressions are the chief factors in building up 
mental life. Impressions, as a matter of fact, never were of 
great importance as compared with reactions, but certainly 
in mature life sensations sink far into the background. 
The so-called psychological method turns out to be quite 
unpsychological in the analyses of mental processes which 
it proposes. 
The real difficulty here is like that which was discussed 
a few paragraphs above when dealing with the example of 
pronunciation as employed by the Committee of Twelve. 
The mature mind has a fixed system of verbal reactions ; 
and the development of a new foreign system of reactions 
is difficult just in the degree that the foreign language 
involves forms of reaction not present in the vernacular. 
SPEcIAL DIFFICULTIES IN TEACHING AMERICAN 
CHILDREN 
In this connection it is interesting to note that people 
who have in their vernacular a highly inflected and com- 
plex language can learn a simple language very much more 
readily than one who has as his native tongue such a simple 
language as English. 
   
-P-A-G-E-247
FOREIGN LANGUAGES 237 
ForEIGN LANGUAGES DEMAND NEw REACTIONS 
The acquisition of a foreign language for a mature mind 
is accordingly a process of fitting new word impressions and 
reactions into an established system of language reactions. 
The meaning of this statement can be made clear by con- 
sidering the following facts. There are certain grammatical 
habits peculiar to every language. This difference can be 
illustrated by drawing attention to the fact that in Latin 
and German it is perfectly safe to place the object of a 
verb before the subject of the sentence. In both of these 
inflected languages the accusative case shows by its form 
that it is the object of a verb. In English, on the other 
hand, the student must give heed to the order of his words 
and is always dependent upon the order of the sentence 
for the discrimination between the subject and the object 
of the verb. One naturally comes, therefore, in the English 
sentences to a fixity of arrangement which is unknown to 
the Latin or German language. Not only so, but the forms 
of inversion within the subordinate clauses are matters of 
habit of thought which English-speaking people find it diffi- 
cult to take on. When one transposes the verb in German, 
he has expressed a relationship which seems very natural 
in the thought of the German, but has to be laboriously 
acquired by an English-speaking person. These habits of 
syntax are undoubtedly important if one is to speak a lan- 
guage. They are of some significance if one is to understand 
a language. 
Habits of syntax are eclipsed in importance by habits of 
interpretation induced through intimate contact with words. 
There is no exact synonym for many a foreign word. Our 
own language has developed certain shades of meaning, 
full appreciation of which can be cultivated only by paying 
close attention to all the different contexts in which Eng- 
lish words appear. The foreign word, in like fashion, has
-P-A-G-E-248
  288 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
its own peculiar significance ; and that peculiar significance 
will be learned only by seeing the word in its proper con- 
text in the foreign language. The most striking examples 
of this sort appear when one tries to understand the German 
attitude toward such exclamations as are very common in 
German colloquial speech but, when translated, constitute 
objectionable profanity in English. The German is con- 
stantly using the term Gott where the literal English trans: 
lation would be offensive and inappropriate. On the other 
hand, the German uses only in extreme cases such a word 
as Donnerwetter. When we try to translate this exclamation 
into English it becomes a very inoffensive remark on the 
weather, but to the German mind it is a form of vulgar 
and offensive profanity. It is quite impossible to convey 
the meaning of these different exclamations by any direct 
translation from one language into another. In like manner, 
the reader of Latin comedies finds himself, in his efforts to 
translate Plautus and Terence, in exactly the same situa- 
tion in which a student of modern French finds himself 
when he tries to translate the slang of French colloquial 
speech. One is justified in saying, in the presence of these 
striking examples, that a language can never be translated. 
Again, take such cases as the following. The conception 
which the German has when he uses such a common verb 
as machen is wholly different from the notion which the 
Englishman has when he uses the literal translation “ to 
make.” Mark Twain has pointed out in his discussions of 
the German language this peculiarity of the Teutonic mind 
in connection with the general word machen. Perhaps we 
can find a suitable English parallel in the colloquial use 
of the word “thing.” An ordinary American uses the word 
“thing” to refer to objects in the external world, social 
situations, mental processes, and experiences; in short, he 
uses it on all occasions when he wishes to get a word that 
shall refer back to any situation which has been described 
 
-P-A-G-E-249
FOREIGN LANGUAGES 239 
in an earlier sentence. “I meant no such thing” is a good 
illustration of the general use of the term. Such an idiom as 
this is almost unintelligible to anyone in whose language the 
common word for “thing” holds closer to the substantive 
idea. The curious mistakes which one finds when foreigners 
try to use some of the most common idiomatic phrases can 
be understood when we recognize the fact that a foreign 
word, in its own context, has legitimate shades of meaning 
which cannot be translated into another tongue. 
MEANING THROUGH CONTEXT 
  Such considerations as these are in the minds of lan- 
guage teachers when they emphasize the desirability of 
using only foreign words in the foreign-language class. 
The foreign word then gets its meaning from its setting, 
we are told, and the student is saved the confusion of 
trying to translate. The advantages and disadvantages of 
translation have been commented on above. It remains 
here to call attention to the fact that if the student can- 
not be thought of as beginning at the beginning when he 
meets a foreign word, the chances are great that he will 
fall back on one of his familiar vernacular reactions. As 
in the case of pronunciation, there is much to be said in 
favor of the method of conscious direction of the learner’s 
efforts by contrasting foreign words with vernacular words. 
The mature high-school student can, if properly directed, 
make comparisons which will be productive. Why not give 
him some of the advantages of an analytical study of the 
foreign word in contrast with the vernacular ? 
GRADED EXERCISES 
The other alternative is to make a very gradual entrance 
into the language through a series of carefully prepared 
exercises. This was the second aim of the psychological 
   
-P-A-G-E-250
  240 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
method. The method, as worked out especially by Gouin, 
gradually builds up a vocabulary by taking a few simple 
words and carrying the student step by step through com- 
binations of these words and more elaborate combinations of 
simpler words to a final mastery of the foreign vocabulary. 
This gradual method of procedure gives the student a certain 
confidence and a certain ability to interpret the whole idea 
that is expressed in the sentence, as distinguished from the 
partial idea that comes from an isolated word. The psycho- 
logical study of language has made it perfectly clear that 
the unit of all language consciousness is the sentence rather 
than the isolated word. A sentence conveys a fully rounded 
series of experiences. The psychological method undoubt- 
edly does well to take advantage of the possibility of giving 
the student in foreign language, as well as in his vernacular, 
a whole sentence rather than a part of the sentence. 
No elaborate argument needs to be presented in support 
of the effort which the psychological method has made to 
grade its sentences. If the sentences can be so worked out 
that the student can interpret the new words from the con- 
text, the interpretation will be exact in character and will, 
at the same time, serve to make the student independent 
in his later interpretations of new words and new sentences. 
Tue Direct MretHop 
This method of gradually inducting the student into the 
language has also been called the direct method. Great en- 
thusiasm has of late been expressed for the direct method both 
among teachers of modern languages and among teachers of 
classics. The following quotation from W. H. D. Rouse? 
illustrates how far some teachers are willing to go in praise 
of the direct method.

It is fortunately no longer needful to defend the direct 
method of teaching languages, no one whose opinion is based 
on knowledge now attacks it, so long as the languages to be 
taught are modern. But there was a time not so long ago, 
when the method was derided as foolish or slovenly by those 
who had not tried it; and this is the case now with the direct 
method of teaching Latin and Greek. Those who have tried it, 
so far as my knowledge goes, are quite at ease in their minds ; 
they have found not only that it is quicker and more attrac- 
tive, but that it does really what the exercise-book method 
pretends to do, that is, it holds the attention in detail, disci- 
plines the mental faculties, and enables the scholars to under- 
stand and to appreciate the best qualities in the best literature. 
Of course, the direct method is not all talking; the system 
includes reading, writing, and even the conscious learning of 
grammar, although in different order and different proportion 
to that of the exercise books. But speech does take in it the 
first place. 
The direct method has been vigorously discussed under 
a variety of titles in recent years. It is sometimes called 
the reform method; sometimes it is designated the analyt- 
ical, inductive method. A full description of its details 
can be found in a pamphlet by Viétor.! Sometimes the 
phonic element has been emphasized, as in the report of 
the Committee of Twelve. 
AIM MUST CONTROL THE METHOD OF INSTRUCTION 
‘We may concentrate attention on the one fundamental, 
psychological question which comes up everywhere. This 
fundamental, psychological problem can be stated in this

form: Should foreign languages be taught by a method which 
ignores, as far as possible, the acquired grammatical and ver- 
bal habits of the student, or should the contrast between the 
vernacular and the foreign language be consciously brought 
out and made an important part of the study? 
The writer once saw an experiment in teaching which puts 
the issue in a clear light. He visited a school in a rural 
district where a clergyman had gathered together a few of 
the children of the community who had taken all that the 
district school could offer, and was attempting to give them 
some view of higher subjects. The teacher, who was him- 
self trained in Latin and Greek, was utilizing a few Latin 
stories to teach the children something about the Roman 
language and the derivation of English words. This teacher 
was not attempting to give a Latin course. He had no 
grammar, and he had no desire to make the students ac- 
quainted with Latin literature through the reading of Latin 
texts. In fact, he had changed the pronunciation which 
he had himself cultivated in college, and was utilizing for 
purposes of training the children an English pronunciation, 
which helped them to recognize the direct relationship 
between the Latin roots and the familiar English words 
which are derived from these roots. 
Tue InpuctivE METHOD 
Another example which illustrates the issue is seen in an 
experiment which was undertaken a few years ago in the 
so-called inductive method. The method never proved a 
general success, probably because it sacrificed the language 
in order to give students principles about language. A 
brief review of the method will indicate how far it went 
in analytical studies of language.? 
1 Harper and Burgess, Inductive Latin Primer, Preface. American 
Book Company, 1891.   
-P-A-G-E-253
   FOREIGN LANGUAGES 243 
A sentence of the original text is placed before the pupil. 
The pronunciation and exact translation of each word are 
furnished him. By the aid which the teacher gives him in 
advance, and with the help given in the book, he thoroughly 
masters the words and phrases of this sentence. His knowledge 
is tested by requiring him to recite or write the Latin sentence, 
with only the translation before his eye. 
In connection with this mastery of the words and phrases of 
the sentence assigned, the pupil reads and digests the contents 
of the ‘ Notes” on these words. This study accomplishes two 
things: first, the careful examination of each remark, with its 
application to the work in hand, aids in fixing more firmly 
in mind the word sought to be mastered; second, grammatical 
material is being collected from the very beginning of his work. 
The “ Text” and “ Notes” having been learned, the next step 
is one of a more general character. Out of the material which 
has thus far been mastered, those principles which are of most 
importance, and which the pupil himself will. be most likely to 
recognize, are pointed out under the head of “ Observations.” 
The pupil should be brought to see these principles for him- 
self before reading the statement of them in the ‘t Observations.” 
The words of the sentence are now separated from their con- 
text and placed in alphabetical order. Thus separated, they 
form the basis of additional study. 
In order to prevent the memorizing of the Latin text with- 
out a clear idea of the force of each word, to impress more 
firmly on the mind the words and phrases of the text, and to 
drill the pupil in prose composition — “ Exercises,” Latin into 
English and English into Latin are given. These are always 
based upon the sentence which furnishes the basis of the 
“ Lesson.” 
Once more the leading points of the entire lesson, whether 
suggested in the ‘t Notes,” the “ Observations,” or the ‘ Vocab- 
ulary,” come up for consideration under the head of “ Topics 
for Study.” Upon each topic the student is expected to make 
a statement of what he knows (not of what has been said in 
the book). If his statement is not sufficiently full, it will be 
criticized by the class. 
 
-P-A-G-E-254
  244 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
From this outline the idea of the method will be apparent. 
It proposes: first, to gain from the classic text an accurate 
knowledge of some of the facts of the language; second, to 
learn from these facts the principles which they illustrate, and 
by which they are regulated; third, to apply these principles 
in the further progress of the work. 
This method is reported to have been most successful in 
the hands of skilled teachers in giving to mature students 
within the compass of a few exercises some knowledge 
of the language and much knowledge about the principles 
of construction and interpretation. 
SprcIAL ENDS SERVED BY DIFFERENT MrerHops 
Our psychological analysis makes it easy to understand 
the school situation as it confronts us to-day. Those who 
would teach students to master a language and have much 
time for instruction tend toward the direct method. Those 
who are interested in the scientific study of language em- 
phasize analytical discussions and are skeptical of the direct 
method. Wherever mature students are involved, the direct 
method tends to give way to some form of analytical method. 
Analytical methods in one sphere, as, for example, in pro- 
nunciation, are at times combined with direct methods in 
other spheres, as, for example, in the interpretation of words. 
In the meantime, teachers of English-speaking children do 
not make as much headway with language instruction as do 
teachers of children familiar with a highly inflected language. 
On the administrative side, pressure becomes more in- 
tense to reduce the amount of time given to language 
courses and to increase the value to the student of what 
he takes even if he remains in the course only one year. 
Furthermore, there can be no doubt that we are con- 
fronted in America with a grave problem because we begin 
language work late, that is, in the high school or even in  
-P-A-G-E-255
FOREIGN LANGUAGES 245 
the college. The methods appropriate to teaching children 
in their early years are radically different from those ap- 
propriate to maturer years. Just at what point the direct 
method should diminish and the analytical method increase 
is with us a most urgent problem, and, unfortunately, as 
yet an unsolved problem. While this problem is awaiting 
solution we are all much in the position of the Commit- 
tee of Twelve. We praise the direct method and follow 
the analytical method, with strong leanings toward the 
grammatical method. 
GENERAL LANGUAGE COURSE 
There is one experiment which a psychologist may ven- 
ture to suggest to teachers of language. Let a course be 
prepared that shall teach much about language structures 
through an analytical study of some foreign language. Let 
the student have an insight into the rich field of compar- 
ative philology and comparative study of civilization. Take 
some of the time now given uselessly to English composi- 
tion if the foreign-language departments are unwilling to 
contribute the time for such a course. Let such a course be 
open to everyone who wants to know in a year what Latin 
and German are. When this course has been tried, note 
whether students do not begin language work of the pres- 
ent type more enthusiastically. 
By way of practical administrative suggestion it may be 
legitimate to urge that some of the instructional energy 
which is being rapidly released in the classical departments 
be turned to the task of trying this experiment. 
Finally, in order to make perfectly clear the psychological 
conclusion of the whole matter, let it be explicitly pointed 
out that there is no single best method of teaching foreign 
languages. The method must vary with the purpose and 
the maturity of students.

  246 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
Ciass OBSERVATION 
In this connection the writer may venturé to add two 
observations made in the classroom. He has observed classes 
struggling to get a meaning of a foreign word, and con- 
fused beyond degree because of the teacher’s dogmatic de- 
termination to use only the direct method; and he has been 
persuaded that it requires more than ordinary resourceful- 
ness and more command of the language than most teachers 
possess to adhere at all times to the strictest form of the 
direct method. Second, like every other observer of lan- 
guage instruction, he has seen formal analysis carried to 
such limits that he has been almost persuaded to become 
a convert to the most extreme form of the direct method. 
If one could gain the advantages of direct use of the lan- 
guage without losing the virtues of analysis, and could also 
get some of the quick returns of intelligent analytical study 
as a foundation for later, more intimate appreciation of 
words in their context, he would in a measure gain the 
advantages of both tendencies. If one must choose, his 
choice will certainly depend on general social conditions. 
Children in their early years gain little from analysis; 
adults gain much. Time is always a factor which must be 
considered. The consideration of these social factors sug- 
gests that probably there is truth in several different and 
apparently opposing statements about languages and lan- 
guage teaching. We may therefore close, as we began, with 
a plea for careful, discriminating, impersonal examination 
of all claims and methods rather than a partisan dogmatism 
in favor of any single solution of the matter.

CHAPTER XI 
OPPOSITION BETWEEN THE PRACTICAL ARTS AND 
LANGUAGE 
Thus far we have discussed the problems which relate 
to the teaching of mathematics and the language subjects. 
It would perhaps be most natural to continue the discussion 
by taking up those branches of school work which depend 
very largely upon the ability to use books, such as history 
and certain phases of science. Language is not merely a 
subject of instruction in itself, it is also a tool employed 
in the study of other subjects. But the psychological prob- 
lems which confront us in teaching any subject which de- 
pends upon the use of books can be clearly understood only 
when we contrast with book subjects those which depend 
upon the cultivation of practical, manual skill. 
Risz or New Sussects or INstRUCTION 
There is at the present time a growing tendency in the 
secondary course to recognize the importance of various 
kinds of training which are wholly at variance, so far as 
their content and form are concerned, with the academic 
traditions of earlier years. One finds in the technical high 
school of to-day an equipment for shop work and laboratory 
work that is altogether foreign to the conception of educa- 
tion which was common in the high school of a generation 
ago. Agriculture has taken a major place in those high 
schools which are situated in rural communities. Much of 
the work of the agricultural high schools is carried on in 
247 
     
-P-A-G-E-258
  248 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
the field in a fashion utterly unfamiliar to the’ high-school 
teacher at the close of the last century. 
The introduction of these new subjects has been hastened 
by the demand of the industries that more attention be 
given to the preparation of expert laborers. The problem 
of providing for boys from fourteen to sixteen years of age 
is one of the clearly recognized and conspicuous problems 
of present-day social life. While the urgency of the situa- 
tion is somewhat less for girls, there is nevertheless a clear 
recognition of the fact that some kind of training must be 
devised for girls who are not going to take the ordinary 
high-school course. 
We turn away, then, from the discussion of language and 
all that belongs to the language subjects, for the purpose of 
gaining a clearer notion of the mental processes which attach 
to these newer subjects. We shall then be able to return to 
the analysis of science and history with a better preparation 
for the appreciation of their place in the course of study. 
MANUAL TRAINING AND INDUSTRIAL COURSES 
The first break in the curriculum which carried the schools 
away from the purely academic traditions of an earlier day 
was in the direction of the kind of training specifically 
known as manual training. In America the Centennial 
Exposition in Philadelphia was undoubtedly important in 
bringing the attention of American educators to the value 
of this sort of instruction for school children. For a number 
of years great enthusiasm was exhibited at certain centers. 
Very shortly, however, objections presented themselves. 
Where the manual-training courses followed rigidly one of 
the set systems, these courses were criticized as formal and 
destructive to initiative. On the other hand, when no sys- 
tem was followed, the courses were criticized as loose and 
unsystematic. In recent years it has become the fashion in
-P-A-G-E-259
THE PRACTICAL ARTS AND LANGUAGE 249 
some quarters to attack manual training as a wholly unsuc- 
cessful experiment. It is said to be neither academic nor 
practical. Industrial training is urged as the true method 
of giving skill of hand and equipment for real life. Fur- 
thermore, there are general social forces pushing in the 
direction of industrial education. So it comes that as we 
hear less of manual training we hear more of industrial arts. 
There can be no doubt that the technical industrial arts 
are at the present moment very much respected by modern 
society and by those school officers who wish to keep the 
curriculum abreast with the demands of modern life. 
Our discussion naturally follows both of these lines of 
development. We may with propriety introduce the whole 
discussion by considering the psychological claims of man- 
ual training in its most general form. We shall not con- 
cern ourselves in this general discussion with any of the 
minor disputes which have arisen within the camp of tech- 
nical teachers themselves. We shall use the term “man- 
ual training” to include any of the forms of manual work 
which have been developed in recent years in the general, 
untechnical, nonindustrial courses of study. We shall then 
take up briefly the mental processes which are developed in 
the course of the cultivation of some of the industrial arts. 
It may be well to point out, before entering upon the 
details of these various discussions, that it is not in place 
here to canvass all of the considerations that arise in con- 
nection with these different subjects. Our business is merely 
to make a psychological analysis of these different forms 
of training. The social conditions which call for more or 
less emphasis on one or the other of the practical forms of 
training we cannot with propriety take up. We shall have 
occasion repeatedly to refer to the fact that the strictly 
educational questions which arise in the effort to introduce 
these subjects into the course of study are very much com- 
plicated by social conditions. For example, there is the fact 
   
-P-A-G-E-260
eR ee Ler We MOM Neen SF eC TARE) Tes ens yee Ene 
250 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
that specialists in the technical arts have felt themselves 
for a long time separated from the rest of the teaching pro- 
fession by a prejudice against the manual arts. As one of 
the chief exponents of these arts has pointed out :* 
WOODWARD ON THE DIFFICULTIES OF INTRODUCING 
MANUAL TRAINING 
The traditions are heavily against us, but the traditions of 
the fathers must yield to the new dispensation. As was to 
have been expected, the strongest prejudices against this re- 
form exist in old educational centers. ... The idea of giving 
heed to the demands of skilled labor, of preparing for lives of 
activity and usefulness; the idea of earning one’s daily bread 
and of supporting one’s family — scarcely enters their heads. 
. .. Insuch an atmosphere as that, how incongruous is the ap- 
peal of minds for an education to things ; for a training of the 
hand and eye as well as the intellect to lives of useful employ- 
ment!... The highly cultivated would soar away into purer 
air and nobler spheres. There is a feeling, more or less clearly 
expressed, that the material world is gross and unrefined ; that 
soiled hands are a reproach; that the garb of a mechanic 
necessarily clothes ‘a person of sordid tastes and low desires. 
There can be no denying that this sort of prejudice exists 
in many quarters. To be sure, it is breaking down very 
rapidly. Again and again, however, one must listen to the 
charge made by one’s own colleagues in the educational 
profession that the educational world is not only preju- 
diced against the practical arts, but is wholly unable to 
sympathize with their introduction into the school. In a 
recent discussion the Commissioner of Education? of the 
State of Massachusetts made the following statements:

THE PRACTICAL ARTS AND LANGUAGE 261 
SNEDDEN ON VOCATIONAL COURSES 
Ancient division exists between so-called cultural education 
and the practical affairs of life. The schoolmaster has kept his 
pupils as long as possible from submergence in utilitarian activi- 
ties. He has often had a contempt for the manual occupations. 
He has looked with favor upon professional callings and others 
involving the maximum of intellectual activity. On the other 
hand, the practical man has always looked upon the school- 
master as somewhat over-refined, effeminate and impractical, 
with a disposition to follow visions. . . . 
With reference to these issues, my experience has been that 
the inherited antagonism between cultural and vocational edu- 
cation has by no means disappeared, and that to an extent as 
yet unrealized the educator not only holds to traditional views, 
but is constitutionally unable in many cases to alter his atti- 
tude. It seems to me that the educational literature of this 
country contains as yet surprisingly few statements regarding 
either the desirability or the feasibility of vocational education 
that exhibits the educator as a profound student of this sub- 
ject. . .. Undoubtedly predisposed desires are in the direction 
of a purely intellectual approach to problems of skill as well 
as those of understanding. 
PsycHOLOGICAL StuDY AN ANTIDOTE FOR 
DISAGREEMENT 
Even more vigorous comments upon the situation than 
those which have just been quoted can be found in current 
educational literature, but for our purposes it is enough to 
call attention to the fact that other than strictly psycholog- 
ical considerations are operative in determining the entrance 
of practical courses into the curriculum of the high school. 
Needless to say, the psychologist has no sympathy with any 
of these prejudices. His one problem — as in the discussion 
of the various methods of teaching language — is to dis- 
cover, if possible, the essential character of the mental proc- 
esses which are aroused by the practical arts. 
 
-P-A-G-E-262
CHAPTER XII 
MANUAL SKILL; PRACTICAL AND THEORETICAL 
EXPERIENCE 
THE PsycHoLoGy oF SKILL 
The psychology of skill is a chapter in the psychology 
of habit. We have come to realize in studies of animal 
and human behavior the importance of habit. The nervous 
system of the child is, at the beginning of life, a mass 
of unrealized possibilities. A visual stimulus entering the 
brain of an infant may come out in the form of a cry of 
surprise or fear; the hand may move in the effort to grasp 
the bright object from which the visual stimulus came; 
there may be a movement of the head; or the child may 
begin to turn away with his whole body. Out of this mass 
of possibilities comes, in the course of life, a series of regular 
modes of response. The nervous system, which was charac- 
terized at first by unlimited possibilities of varying response, 
is organized into a series of regular channels of response for 
each familiar stimulus. Such an organization of the nervous 
system has disadvantages as well as advantages. The man of 
fifty cannot adjust himself to new situations as can the child, 
because the nervous system of the mature man has been 
mapped out for better or for worse into a system of paths. 
The adult has his habits all formed. If these habits are of 
such a type that they carry him through life comfortably and 
successfully, well and good; if his habits are such that he 
continually does the wrong thing, he must suffer. The one 
major fact is that the nervous system has been laid out into 
a series of paths, and the habits of life are formed. 
252
-P-A-G-E-263
MANUAL SKILL 253 
Among the habits cultivated in this transition from 
infancy to maturity are those which we group together 
under the general term “skill.” One shows skill when he 
plays tennis, when he saws a board or drives a nail. A 
girl shows skill when she threads a needle or beats an egg. 
The artisan shows skill when he feeds a machine or sorts out 
its products. In all these cases the nervous system has been 
organized so that the stimulus which comes into the eye or 
the finger passes quickly and surely to the hand and arouses 
an act which through long repetition has come to have a 
degree of precision comparable to a mechanical process. 
CHARACTERISTIC LACK OF ANALYSIS 
If we look into consciousness during the performance of 
an act which has developed into a habit we shall find as 
one of its most conspicuous characteristics an absence of 
all analysis. The consciousness which one has when he hits 
a tennis ball or a nail is a total, undivided experience of the 
whole situation. We sometimes speak of this experience as 
a feeling. One has a feeling that he has done the act well 
or badly, but he cannot tell either how he did it or how the 
successive steps of the processes took place. We sometimes 
‘describe the situation by saying that one does the act with- 
out any consciousness at all. Thus we say that we write 
without any consciousness of pencil and paper or the form 
of letters. We say that the carpenter adjusts his plane to 
the grain of the wood without thinking. Obviously such 
descriptive phrases are not to be taken literally. The person 
who is writing would be very promptly aware of the fact if 
his efforts produced no marks. This is evidence enough 
that he is not unconscious of paper and pencil and black 
lines. The carpenter knows when his plane is properly 
driven and he gets satisfaction out of the shaving which 
he produces. There is always consciousness accompanying 
   
-P-A-G-E-264
  254 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
an habitual act, but it is not analytical consciousness. One 
does not think of details; one sees the situation as a whole. 
Tf questions are asked referring to some particular part of 
the situation, the reactor is at a loss to disentangle this part 
of the situation from the whole. 
For the sake of a scientific study of habit the psycholo- 
gist must make an analysis which the reactor himself does 
not make. Let us consider, therefore, the factors of a habit, 
taking our stand outside of the reactor and looking at him 
for the moment not as a conscious being but as a complex 
machine. Later we shall come back to a consideration of 
the inner, conscious characteristics of this same individual. 
Sensory “ ConTROLS” IN HANDWRITING 
Since writing is one of the most common types of skill 
with which the school has to deal, and since it has been 
scientifically analyzed, let us note some of the elements of 
the writing process. We are guided in our formation of let- 
ters in large measure by the sensations of pressure! which 
come to us through the fingers which hold the pen. Espe- 
cially is this true with regard to the height of letters. Let 
anyone try to make his letters twice as high as usual and he 
will at once become aware of the fact that the relations of 
pencil and paper are such that the pencil at the top of the 
letter tends to leave the paper. The old-fashioned shading 
of letters showed the same fact in another way. No heavy 
shading was made by upward strokes, because mechanically 
the pen rises from the paper in upward strokes. The down- 
ward strokes were the heavy strokes, because here the pen 
came with increasing pressure into contact with the paper. 
The changes in pressure which thus control the height of 
our letters are not ordinarily recognized by the writer.

cal Review, 1907, p. 301.

MANUAL SKILL 255 
Little children are more dependent than are adults on in- 
tense experiences of pressure. They break the points of pen 
and pencil because they press too hard in trying to secure 
intense sensations. The pressure sensations help them and 
help the adult in guiding movement. We speak of these 
sensations, therefore, as “controls” of writing, because as 
soon as the pressure at the top of a letter gets light the 
skillful writer is controlled in his movement and turns 
back. In like manner he is controlled at the bottom of his 
letter by the increasing pressure. 
TAcTUAL CONTROLS IN THE USE OF TOOLs 
Every habitual act is governed by certain sensory con- 
trols. Each tool in the manual-training shop has its partic- 
ular system of controls. Take, for example, the saw. When 
one drives the saw forward, it should engage the wood vig- 
orously, just as the pen makes naturally a heavy downward 
stroke. When the saw is drawn back it should pass lightly 
over the wood. The skillful sawyer makes his movements 
without stopping to analyze the experience. The learner, 
on the other hand, has to pay close attention in order to 
acquire the proper adjustment of movements and sensa- 
tions. Furthermore, the expert sawyer is instantly respon- 
sive to the sensations which come from his saw if the line 
which he is following is not perfectly straight. Let the 
saw swerve ever so little and the skillful workman makes 
the necessary turn of his hand. He knows, further, how 
to adjust his stroke to different kinds of material; and he 
knows also that when the board is just about divided he 
must make a skillful stroke in completing the cut which 
the novice does not know how to accomplish. 
Contrast with the experiences which control the use 
of the saw those which control the use of the hammer. 
The workman very frequently gets indispensable aid in 
   
-P-A-G-E-266
  256 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
controlling the hammer, which is swung with the right 
hand, by grasping with the left hand the nail which is to 
be driven. The guidance of the hammer depends further 
on the sensations received from the handle. These in 
turn are determined by the balance of the head on the 
handle, by the length of the handle, and by the way in 
which the hand grasps the handle. Each of these elements 
of the situation contributes to the experiences of pressure 
which the workman gets in the palm of his hand from the 
handle. Each stroke that he makes is guided by his sensa- 
tions. But he does not analyze the situation into these 
elements. He thinks of it as a whole. He becomes accus- 
tomed to his hammer. He regards it as a misfortune when 
he breaks the handle, because the nice stroke is controlled 
by the familiar relation of the tool to his arm movement. 
Furthermore, the stroke itself is a complex series of adjust- 
ments. The skillful workman lets the hammer bear the 
shock of the stroke by relaxing the hand somewhat just at 
the instant of impact. The novice takes the stroke in his 
hand because he grasps the handle tightly. Finally, there 
is the precision of the stroke. The novice moves irregu- 
larly, now in one downward line and now in another. The 
skillful workman gauges his movements from the first 
movement, which is often a movement away from the nail 
to be hit, and thereafter swings the hammer with unerr- 
ing precision in the same are. The sensory surfaces of 
the workman’s joints are involved during movement and 
supplement the skin of the hand in reporting to him the 
slightest deviation from the true course. He has complete 
sensory control of the swing, but he does not distinguish 
the separate sensory controls. 
The foregoing analysis of tools will perhaps be clearer if 
we suggest the possibility of grouping together such tools 
as the knife, the saw, and the plane. All are cutting in- 
struments and have the same general type of drive forward
-P-A-G-E-267
MANUAL SKILL 257 
and relaxed withdrawal. All must govern the intensity of 
the stroke by the texture of the material. All have second- 
ary adjustments which are necessary if the stroke is to be 
kept straight. The control of these cutting tools is of a 
wholly different type from that of the driving tool. Fur- 
thermore, certain complex adjustments appear in the dif- 
ferent methods of using the same tool. Is a chisel a cutting 
or a driving instrument? The answer to such a question 
leads us into the discussion of the chisel driven by the hand 
as different in its uses from the chisel driven by the hammer. 
The psychology of the workshop could be indefinitely 
extended. We have a psychology of play ; why not a psy- 
chology of the industrial arts? The delicacy of control ex- 
hibited in holding a billiard cue or in striking a golf ball 
has perhaps been more fully discussed than the corre- 
sponding facts in the lives of artisans, because the player 
has more leisure and more social incentives for analysis 
than has the workman. 
VisuAL CONTROLS 
Up to this point the sensory controls which have been 
discussed are those which come through the sense of touch. 
Another and even more elaborate discussion might be 
undertaken of visual controls in sawing and hammering. 
Rather than duplicate the description which has been given 
of touch sensations, however, we shall leave to the reader 
the description of the visual controls and shall turn directly 
to the important fact that in many cases vision, in spite 
of its general superiority, is not as useful a control for del- 
icate movements as is touch. For example, the skill which 
the piano player acquires through a tactual recognition of 
the position of the fingers transcends visual control. In 
like fashion the skill of the carpenter who can saw a straight 
line by keeping his saw straight is much greater than that 
     
-P-A-G-E-268
  258 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
of the novice who must look at the line and follow the 
seen line with his tool. In typewriting, the “touch” method 
is more rapid and exact than the mixed method, in which 
vision plays a part. 
OTHER SENSATIONS 
Another contrast which has been suggested, and is of 
importance, is the contrast between sensations which come 
from the joints and inner organs and those which come 
from the ends of the fingers and skin. The typewriter 
who knows just how far to move from one key to the next 
and the piano player who takes three notes at one stroke 
by the nicest spatial adjustment of his fingers are not 
controlled by the skin sensations which come from their 
contact with the keys, but by the sensations from the joints 
and muscles of the fingers and hand. 
ABSENCE OF ANALYSIS 
This discussion of the sensory controls which are present 
in all habits leads us to a very interesting psychological 
problem. Why does the person who uses all these sensory 
controls fail to recognize them? |The answer to this ques- 
tion has already been suggested. Consciousness is not or- 
dinarily sufficiently analytic to make the reactor aware of 
all the details. The reactor’s consciousness deals with sit- 
uations in the gross. Even when one begins to be analytic 
in his thought he is not likely to select as his object of 
attention the particular sensation which guides him in action. 
Let us consider the rise of any particular habit; take, 
for example, the bicycle-riding habit. When one first gets 
on a bicycle, there is a great mass of sensations and a vivid 
consciousness of striving. This massive experience is soon 
supplemented by more experience arising from contact with  
-P-A-G-E-269
MANUAL SKILL 259 
the ground and the necessity of disentangling one’s self 
from the capsized object of attention. Little by little one 
gets so that he can pick out from this mass of experience 
the handlebars and the road ahead. As long as he holds 
tightly to the one and keeps his eyes fixedly on the other, 
matters seem to improve. The tight gripping of the handle- 
bars gives the learner warning, through the sense of touch, 
of the slightest turning of the wheel, and thus one comes 
to avoid disaster by responding to these early danger sig- 
nals. The eyes fixed on the path notify one of a change in 
relation of the body to the plumb-line and also deviations 
from the safe line of progress. The learner’s consciousness 
will not exhibit all the facts with equal distinctness. He 
will see in the center and focus of consciousness the road, 
and then more road. The rest of the content of conscious- 
ness will be a vast, unanalyzed mass of what we call, for 
want of a better term, “feeling.” This so-called feeling is 
not pleasure or displeasure; it is strain and tension. The 
rider is stretching every nerve, and is full of experience but 
not of detailed knowledge of his acts. A week later the 
paths in the nervous system will be organized so that the 
movements are satisfactory, but there will be no knowledge 
on the learner’s part of the details of his adjustments. 
The intimations of loss of equilibrium which come through 
hand and eye now set up corrective movements without 
delay and without fail. The road has expanded into the 
countryside, and our rider thinks about the landscape. 
The content of his consciousness is what he sees; and 
all the feelings of bodily adjustment combine as a vague, 
undifferentiated margin of experience. Unless some new 
motive arises, he will never bring into the focus of thought 
the sensations of pressure from the handlebars and sensations 
of bodily movement which come from his efforts to main- 
tain equilibrium. He has achieved a result without study- 
ing the process of his achievement. The details of how he 
 
-P-A-G-E-270
    260 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
reached the result he does not know, for they were in his 
mind only a vague, massive feeling. The more perfect his 
adjustment the less motive there is to analyze the situation. 
ANALYSIS SUPERIMPOSED ON HABIT 
One motive which might lead a bicycle rider to analyze 
his experience would be the necessity of teaching someone 
else. The analysis in this case would be greatly aided by 
the fact that one could watch in his pupil each stage of 
adjustment from the outsider’s point of view. The expert 
rider sees the learner tipping and trying to recover by a 
sudden jerk. This is the wrong way to act. What is the 
right way? Now the expert realizes that he moves the 
front wheel in the direction in which he feels the bicycle 
tipping, so as to increase the breadth of his supporting base, 
and gradually recovers equilibrium by a slow movement. 
The whole process is thus reviewed analytically by first 
being looked at from the outside. The result in the mind 
of one who has made such an analysis is a curious mixtur 
of images of someone else, images of one’s self as thoug! 
looked at from the outside, and sensations of tipping an 
movements of recovery. 
Another good illustration of the analytical process neces 
sary to understand one’s skill appears when one tries t 
teach someone to hold his hands as he should to perfor 
some manual trick involving both the right and left hands. 
One can move his own hands in the proper succession, bu 
he is so confused by trying to guide the other person’ 
hands in a relation which always presents itself in visio 
in the reverse that analysis is almost impossible. 
It will be recognized from the examples which have bee! 
discussed that analysis does not naturally arise in the cours 
of ordinary experience. One must get a new point of vie 
if he is to make an analysis. If he does not deliberatel.
-P-A-G-E-271
MANUAL SKILL 261 
place himself outside of the ordinary experience, he will 
tend to think only of the outlying circumstances. The 
most striking evidences of this are the mistakes which peo- 
ple make in regard to their performances. Thus the un- 
trained workman is likely to think the wood is hard rather 
than to recognize that his tool is dull. The tired bicycle 
rider thinks something is wrong with his wheel because it is 
so hard to move his legs. In both these cases the analyses 
are wrong because they are guided by accidental prejudices. 
Consciousness is thus seen to be, in many cases, an unsafe 
guide in the description of a habit. The habit may depend 
on certain complexes of sensation and may operate under 
the guidance of these sensations, while analyses, prompted 
by other motives, may follow other and often unsafe lines. 
ADVANTAGES OF ANALYSIS 
On the other hand, it is perfectly clear from the fore- 
going discussion that personal habits furnish unlimited 
opportunities for the exercise of analysis. One may sub- 
stitute for the accidental and often incorrect analysis of 
ordinary life true and well-directed analysis of a scientific 
type, provided he directs his attention to the experience as 
areal problem. Thus the boy who makes a careful study 
of the construction of his tool before he begins to use it 
will have his attention turned inward to his direct experi- 
ences more than does the ordinary individual. Note how 
the teeth of a saw are set; which way ought it to cut? 
Note that one side of a chisel is beveled and the other is 
straight. Note that one may take hold of a hammer near 
the head or far away. Each of the analyses will help a 
novice, especially if the teacher has worked out clearly in 
his own experience the meaning of the adjustments. The 
analysis makes a student especially sensitive to certain 
impressions which will guide him in his activities. Thus, 
 
-P-A-G-E-272
    262 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
following the example suggested a moment ago, if the 
student realizes that one side of a chisel has a different 
function from the other side, he will be prepared to take 
advantage of the sensations which come to him during the 
use of the tool. If he did not make the preliminary analysis, 
he would receive from the total situation a mass of impres- 
sions, and this mass of impressions would gradually work 
itself out into some degree of skill without any analysis. 
EpucATION AND ANALYSIS 
Analysis is a different kind of mental process from direct, 
habitual contact. Consider the beginner who has made an 
analysis of his tool and observed his material. In the first 
place, his analysis usually employs a different set of sensa- 
tions from those which control his acts. He uses his eye in 
making his analysis. His sense of touch is the one which 
is called into play during direct action. 
The union of preliminary analysis and practical adjust- 
ment is accordingly a larger experience than practical ac- 
tivity taken by itself or visual analysis taken by itself. This 
larger experience, which includes the practical contact with 
the object and also the preliminary analysis, has certain ad- 
vantages over either practical adjustment alone or analysis 
alone. A person who has made a visual analysis appears at 
times to be in a position to concentrate attention upon the 
various aspects of the tool experience which he would not 
have noticed if he had not made the analysis. This leads 
at times to precision of adjustment. At other times the 
effort to analyze the situation seems to cause distraction ; 
that is, if one tries to keep in mind all of the elements of 
his complex experience, he may find that he is distracted 
by the effort to include so much in his consciousness. It is 
frequently pointed out by practical teachers that one must 
not be self-conscious during the performance of the act itself.
-P-A-G-E-273
  MANUAL SKILL 263 
He must concentrate his whole attention upon the object 
with which he is dealing. If he tries to think of his own 
hand, and his own relation to the tool, and the relation of 
the tool to the material, he may get into so elaborate a state 
of consciousness that he will embarrass himself and be 
hindered in what would otherwise be a relatively simple 
and straightforward performance. 
The relating of practical experience and analysis, there- 
fore, constitutes one of the important problems of. educa- 
tional courses in the manual arts. The child in the workshop 
must not be self-conscious about his acts to the extent of 
interfering with his work. Some practical teachers are so 
impressed with this danger of distraction that they prefer 
to omit all possible reference to the analyses that seem to 
them to be too theoretical and remote. On the other hand, 
it must be recognized in many cases that while progress is 
slower under these distracting conditions of analysis, the 
ultimate achievement of the highest skill is promoted and 
the efficiency of the worker increased. When there is no 
analysis, habits of action are likely to become fixed early 
in the individual’s training. On the other hand, where one 
has studied the relation between the tool and the material 
he is open to all sorts of suggestions for change in method, 
and these suggestions of change constitute in later experi- 
ence a very great advantage, because after one has mastered 
the total complex situation and has learned how to use the 
tool, and has at the same time learned how to think about 
its use, he will have a very productive line of comparison 
opened up before him. He will distinguish between his own 
successful and unsuccessful acts and will note what are the 
elements of highest success. He will know how to borrow 
from other workers, for he will know how to watch them, 
In short, his whole activity will be raised to a high level 
of comparative study. 
 
-P-A-G-E-274
  264 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
ANALYSIS NECESSARY IN PROGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR 
There are two types of practical workmen in every trade. 
The one type of workman has acquired practical skill and 
has never thought about the way in which his skill was 
acquired, nor has he thought about the reasons why he is 
skillful. He works in a routine fashion, his activities be- 
coming more and more solidified in the direction in which 
he started by accident at the beginning of his training. His 
methods become more and more fixed, and the whole atti- 
tude of mind comes to be that of an unquestioning worker, 
relying absolutely on the habits and controls which he has 
always used. The other class of workmen will always be 
looking for possible improvements in method, and they will 
succeed in introducing innovations in their own modes of 
activity which will be economical, or at least will be tested 
with reference to their economy. They look upon every 
situation as an object of interest and as an object of study. 
This group of men will find in the practical arts an oppor- 
tunity for continuous mental development. 
This last remark brings us to one of the crucial difficul- 
ties in the organization of practical work as a part of the 
school curriculum. If one goes into the manual-training 
shop and cultivates certain habits of adjustment, but makes 
no analysis of the situations in which he works, the progress 
of his course of study will be entirely different in this shop 
work from his progress in any other field, because shop work 
which is done without any analysis requires less and less 
attention to the act itself. We express this fact by saying 
that a habit requires less and less concentration as it becomes 
more fixed. The second course in manual training to such 
a student is not likely to be any more instructive than was 
the first. Indeed, we may describe the situation as it fre- 
quently appears in manual-training shops by saying that 
there is no progressive enlargement of the scope of work 
 
-P-A-G-E-275
       MANUAL SKILL 265 
in successive courses. The student might just as well have 
done the problems which he encounters in the second and 
third year during his first year of work. He becomes merely 
a more fixed and established artisan without becoming more 
intelligent. There is no intellectual progress involved in 
the training. On the other hand, academic courses usually 
show a very distinct line of increase of breadth and scope 
of interest. As one goes forward in a course in arithmetic 
to a course in algebra, he comes on new topics and new 
interests. If he can be shown the connection between these 
newer interests and the older interests with which he has 
been working, he will himself be distinctly aware of the 
intellectual progress of the work from stage to stage. In 
the same way, as one studies a foreign language he becomes 
increasingly conscious of the wider vocabulary which he 
accumulates and of the richer mental content which comes 
to him through the new books which he is able to read. 
Progression within the course is one of the greatest advan- 
tages that the older and more highly organized subjects 
present in the course of study. If manual training cannot 
in some way secure the same type of progressive interest, 
it will never commend itself as a school subject. This criti- 
cism of manual training cannot be met by simply enlarging 
the type of product which the student makes in the later 
years of his course. One finds at the present time that stu- 
dents in the second year are supposed to be stimulated to 
continue their work with enthusiasm and interest merely 
because they are making something large or because their 
interests are turned to considerations outside the work itself, 
such as the idea of making something useful in the home 
or in the school. Such interest is foreign to the training 
which the course is supposed to give; and unless the course 
itself can devise some means of keeping alive the intellec- 
tual interests of the students, there is no probability that 
an external motive will save it from formalism.

    266 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
EpvucATIONAL VALUE OF MANUAL ARTS 
The lack of clearness among teachers regarding the 
purpose of manual training, and regarding the best form 
which this work may take on, is reflected in a controversy 
which has long been going on about the place of manual 
work in the schools. One party of teachers is in favor of 
the general introduction of manual training into all schools, 
on the ground that there is a unique type of education 
which can be derived from such a course.! 
These educators are anxious to have every child in the 
school required to take such a course. They say that it is 
well even for the boy who is to go into one of the pro- 
fessions that he shall get into the shop and learn the use 
of tools. Sometimes they justify this position in detail by 
saying that he will get a kind of experience in the shop 
which he does not get elsewhere. He will learn how to use 
his hands, and he will get a direct contact with nature 
which he can acquire through no other means. Again, they 
sometimes put the matter in the form of an argument in 
favor of social experience. They say that it is well for the 
boy who is going into a profession to have the same kind 
of experience that is had by the workers who deal with 
material things. §uch a boy will have a larger appreciation 
of the functions in society of the mason and the stoneworker. 
He will have a larger interest in the manufacturing processes 
with which he will come into indirect, social contact. 
This group of teachers who are strongly in favor of 
courses in manual training is opposed by two groups of 
critics. The first group say that manual training does not 
cultivate a high degree of skill. The conditions of work in

-P-A-G-E-277
  MANUAL SKILL 267 
the schools are not enough like conditions of work in the 
shop. There is too much spreading of the worker’s energy 
over loose, general activities. Let us give up manual 
training and have trade training. Trade training will be 
like real shop work. Get a good workman and put him in 
charge. Let skill be cultivated in the well-known fashion 
in which apprentices have always learned. 
The other group of critics are those who say there is not 
enough training of the mind in a shop course. There is 
nothing to make a boy think, and nothing on which he can 
be examined when the work is done. 
The problems suggested by these various contentions 
regarding handwork in the schools never called more ur- 
gently for solution than in this day and age, when techni- 
cal schools are increasing in number and the demand for 
skilled labor is being vigorously set forth by practical men 
in the business world. 
THe REACTION OF MANUAL ARTS ON THE INDIVIDUAL 
We may note again that there are problems suggested 
in these discussions which go beyond the technical courses 
themselves and relate to the influence of the technical arts 
on the whole life and thought of the student. How far 
does the acquisition of skill make the student more appreci- 
ative of industry ? How far does the mastery of a trade 
prepare one to think out new problems of a practical or theo- 
retical type ? Conversely, how far should the school attempt 
to maintain its traditional program, and how far should it 
give up language subjects for the practical subjects ? 
Some of these questions can be stated in a concrete form. 
Here is a boy who has made a table in the manual-training 
shop. He knows how difficult it is to fit together the parts. 
1 David Snedden, The Problem of Vocational Education, pp. 48 ff. 
Houghton Mifflin Company (Riverside Educational Monograph), 1910. 
 
-P-A-G-E-278
  268 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
Will he ever look at a table again without considering how 
well or how badly it is put together? Here is a girl who 
has learned to sew. Will she ever lose her critical insight 
into the quality of workmanship exhibited in a garment ? 
Evidently practical skill is accompanied by the cultivation 
of insights which are difficult to acquire unless one has 
vactually constructed a typical thing. 
We are told also that shop work is very helpful in the 
training of students because each piece of work requires 
a fidelity to the materials used which is more rigid than 
the fidelity required in merely reciting a verbal recitation 
to a class teacher. One may give an ambiguous answer, but 
he cannot drive an ambiguous nail. This demand for strict 
conformity to natural law is said to be very good for students. 
EFFICIENCY DEPENDS ON ADEQUACY OF INSTRUCTION 
The striking fact, when all these claims have been 
recorded, is that manual training has sometimes failed to 
justify itself as a school subject, while in other cases it has 
served a most useful purpose. Here, as in other subjects, 
it is evidently no inherent characteristic of the course itself 
which brings advantage to the student; advantage appears 
or fails to appear because of the mental processes which 
the student cultivates during the course. 
Our problem, therefore, is not to accept any general 
statement about the virtues or defects of manual arts, but 
to study their mental relations. 
EXPERIMENTS ON RELATION OF THEORY AND PRACTICE 
On one aspect of this subject we have much evidence of 
a definite type to which we now turn. We have experi- 
mental studies which show certain of the relations between 
theory and practical behavior. In such a study it is easily
-P-A-G-E-279
MANUAL SKILL 269 
possible to set up a situation in which some practical ac- 
tivity can be definitely measured. Into this practical situa- 
tion we then inject theory at a time and under conditions 
which make it possible to measure the practical activity 
again and discover whether the injection of theory has aided 
or hindered in the perfection of the activity. Such an ex- 
perimental situation as this was set up by requiring two 
groups of boys in the fifth and six grades to hit a target 
under water. To do this, when the target is looked at 
obliquely from above, is a task requiring some readjustment 
of the boy’s ordinary habit of throwing a dart, because the 
light which comes from the target is refracted as it leaves 
the water and, as a result, there is an apparent displacement 
of the target. Furthermore, the amount of apparent dis- 
placement will differ when the depth of the water is changed. 
The two groups of boys selected for the experiment were 
made as nearly alike as possible by including in each group 
some boys who were described by the teachers as bright, 
some who were described by the teacher as slow, and a 
number of mediocres. Such educational experiment should 
always be tried on groups, otherwise results will be obscured 
by marked individual differences. The two groups were 
kept entirely apart from each other so that there was no 
possibility of a disturbance entering into the experiments 
through conference between the two groups. The one group 
was allowed to acquire experience without any instruction 
whatsoever. They were simply set at the task of hitting 
the target. The second group was given a preliminary 
explanation of what is meant by refraction and how the 
apparent displacement of the target is produced. The ex- 
planation thus given to the second group constituted the 
only distinguishing characteristic between the two groups. 
It may therefore be said that one group had the theory of 
the situation, while the other had no theoretical training. 
 
-P-A-G-E-280

270 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
THEORY NO SUBSTITUTE FOR PRACTICE 
The result showed that the two groups of boys required 
the same length of time to learn how to hit the target under 
water. This first result of the experiment shows with per- 
fect clearness that one cannot substitute theory for practical 
experience. One can know something about refraction, 
but if he has to deal with it he must learn to make his 
readjustments to the practical situation by actual readjust- 
ment of his movements, and this actual readjustment of his 
movements apparently will take place at a no more rapid 
rate than it does for any intelligent person who starts out 
to accomplish the practical task. In terms of our earlier 
discussion it may be said that the theory of refraction had 
to do with the visual part of the total experience. An analy- 
sis of the visual facts could not be carried over directly into 
hand movement, hence the time required in making the 
hand adjustment was not reduced through a preliminary 
analysis of the visual facts. 
THEORY FACILITATES ADAPTATION TO NEw CONDITIONS 
After both groups of boys had thus mastered the practi- 
cal situation the experiment was modified by changing the 
depth of water. This change in the depth of water is fol- 
lowed, of course, by a change in the apparent displacement 
of the target. This change in the apparent displacement of 
the target turned out to be a source of very great confusion 
to the boys who had had no theoretical training. They had 
learned how to deal with one situation in which the target 
was under water, and they had at the outset of the ex- 
periment such natural experiences as any boy brings to a 
task of this type, but the new situation produced by chang- 
ing the depth of the water did not correspond to either of 
these sets of experiences which they had mastered. They   
 
-P-A-G-E-281
MANUAL SKILL 271 
consequently oscillated between the newly acquired expe- 
rience with the first depth of water and the earlier, natural 
experience, which had nothing to do with water at all. 
They were doubly confused in their efforts to master the 
new situation. 
The psychology of this confusion is the same as that 
which is often exhibited in practical life. Many men who 
are called upon to face a new practical situation are con- 
fused because of their earlier training and because of their 
fixed, unanalyzed modes of behavior. It is a well-known 
fact in the trades that men who have long been accustomed 
to one method of operation are very much confused by the 
introduction of new methods, such as new machinery or a new 
type of material. Their very training prevents them from ex- 
hibiting the kind of flexibility that would be presented by 
a novice unacquainted with earlier methods of adjustment. 
As contrasted with these boys who had no theoretical 
training, the group of boys who knew the theory of refrac- 
tion presented an entirely different result. These boys who 
knew the theory of the situation adapted themselves rapidly 
to the new depth of water. Their ability to deal with the 
new situation grew out of the fact that this new situation 
was recognized, because of the theory which they studied, in 
its true relation to their earlier experiences. The theory had 
put all their experiences — those without water, those with 
the earlier depth, and finally those with the new depth — in 
asingle scheme of thought. They were aware of the fact that 
there are gradations in apparent displacement, and when 
they encountered a second depth of water they felt able to 
deal with it promptly and efficiently. In other words, after 
they had mastered one practical situation and had compre- 
hended it in the light of their theoretical knowledge, they 
were able to take up rapidly and with all of the advantages 
of earlier experience a new problem which involved both 
practical adjustment and analysis. 
 
-P-A-G-E-282
  272 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
THEORY A SUMMARY OF EXPERIENCE 
Theory is nothing more nor less than the general state- 
ment of accumulated experience. A scheme of thought or 
a scheme of experience will be stated in the form of a gen- 
eral theory when a whole series of variations can be included 
under a single general statement. The individual who 
knows this single general statement can master a series 
of experiences more readily and accurately, because he 
knows where to turn his attention and how to harmonize 
his individual experiences. 
The case is the same as that which was discussed earlier 
in speaking of the sensory controls which appear when one 
is using a tool. If one knows how the tool looks and the 
principle upon which it is constructed, he is in a position 
later when he comes to use this tool to turn his attention to 
the phases of experiences which will be most useful in guid- 
ing him. So theory helps the practical worker to guide his at- 
tention and to understand the situation in which he has come. 
THEORY AND PRACTICAL BEHAVIOR SEPARATE IN 
NATURE AND DEVELOPMENT 
If one studies the development of theoretical knowledge 
in the history of the race, he will see that this statement is 
wholly justified by the way in which theory has developed. 
We shall come later to the full discussion of science as a 
subject of school training, but it may be pointed out in this 
connection that the development of science or theory is not 
the same as the development of practical skill. There are 
races which have grown very skillful in the arts but have 
known nothing of scientific method. Conversely, there have 
been periods when abstract forms of thought have far out- 
stripped practical activities. The greatest problem of mod- 
ern society is to take the results of science into industry

and refine the industrial arts under the guidance of theory. 
The attainment of this desirable end is impeded, however, 
by the fact that science often develops in one mind while 
skill develops in another individual. Even where the scien- 
tific knowledge and practical skill appear in a single indi- 
vidual, it often happens that this individual fails to apply 
such science as he knows to practical activities which he 
takes up at a time when his science lies dormant. 
One of the most striking facts in human mental life is the 
possibility of two experiences failing to influence each other 
though they present the possibilities of productive combina- 
tion. The student studies physics during one hour, and then 
goes into the shop and uses all the laws of mechanics; but 
because the workshop presents these facts in a different 
form, he fails to recognize them. The girl takes chemistry 
and cooking and fails to see the relation between the two. 
THEORY AND LANGUAGE 
The psychology of this situation is perfectly clear in the 
light of our earlier studies. Theory is ordinarily a form of 
verbal reaction ; practical life is a form of hand reaction. 
The boy who tries to hit a target, for example, does not 
use his vocal cords in this effort at all. He uses his hand ; 
and the experiences which he gets through his eye and 
through his contact with the dart issue in a muscular ad- 
justment of the hand and arm. If now one turns the boy’s 
attention away from the actual throwing of the dart and 
points out to him the ray of light as it traverses the water 
and the air, the boy’s mode of reaction to the situation 
which he contemplates is likely to be a verbal reaction. 
He describes the situation to himself. This description of 
the situation is not a practical movement of the hand 
and arm, nor can it be brought, as we saw above, into 
relation to practical movements of the hand and arm 
 
-P-A-G-E-284
  274 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
without some practice and without some contact with new 
and complicated opportunities toconvert theory into practice. 
Persistent effort to adjust behavior to different depths of 
water may develop a more comprehensive form of conscious- 
ness, including both verbal description and hand activity. 
OPPOSITION BETWEEN THEORY AND PRACTICE 
in EpucaTIoN 
This distinction between a verbal description and prac- 
tical reaction is constantly brought to the attention of the 
student of education. No more notable illustration of this 
distinction can be offered to the teacher than the distinc- 
tion which presents itself in one’s own professional experi- 
ence. One may study the theory of school discipline and 
yet be wholly unable when it comes to practical contact 
with students to make the sort of move which will secure 
good discipline. Theory, on the one side, is a verbal descrip- 
tion of a situation; practical activity, on the other, calls 
for all sorts of adjustments to social complexities, and the 
practical adjustments involved are essentially different in 
character from the mere verbal statements. 
Industry has again and again shown itself to be divorced 
from science ; and science has very frequently gone, in its 
theoretical statements, very far away from the practical 
situations that arise in ordinary industry. So sharp is the 
antithesis between science and industry in some cases that 
both parties to the discussion have felt keenly their sepa- 
ration from:each other. The theoretical student has been 
regarded as a mere juggler with words, while the practical 
operator has been thought of as an unintelligent workman 
incapable of analyzing his own experiences and certainly 
unable to transmit to others through clear statements the 
habits which he himself has acquired. 
 
-P-A-G-E-285
  MANUAL SKILL 275 
INSTRUCTION IN APPLICATION SOLUTION OF PROBLEM 
The antithesis will continue so long as one form of be- 
havior is cultivated without a clear recognition of the pos- 
sibility of bringing it into productive relation to the other. 
There must be a higher form of experience than that which 
connects itself with skill of hand or fluency of verbal ex- 
pression. Let us adopt the term “ application ” as a general 
term to signify the relating of two systems of experience 
to each other. Our problem then becomes the problem of 
determining how language can be applied to the indus- 
trial arts, and how the industrial arts can be applied to 
language activities. 
Primitive Forms oF LEARNING 
Behavior of a practical sort is undoubtedly the original 
mode of adjustment, both in the animal kingdom and in 
primitive races. The technical student of psychology notes 
in his studies of such primitive behavior that it develops 
through trial and error. The animal which finds itself in 
a trap or in an inclosure of any kind tries to escape by 
seeking an exit, now at one point and now at another. It 
runs blindly about from place to place and tries every pos- 
sible adjustment. If by accident it makes the right sort of 
adjustment it may escape from the trap. Success in this 
case is due merely to energy in keeping up all sorts of 
lines of endeavor. 
The same general formula explains man’s efforts to edu- 
cate animals. One tries to get an animal to perform a trick. 
He keeps the animal stimulated until finally by a fortu- 
nate combination of circumstances the animal does what is 
wanted. One must be very prompt in rewarding the animal. 
The reward gives a satisfaction which tends to lead to a 
repetition of the successful adjustment. Undoubtedly many 
 
-P-A-G-E-286
276 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
human adjustments are of exactly the same type. The work- 
man who, as an apprentice, is given a certain tool learns in 
the course of his experience some of the skillful methods of 
using this tool. He tries one method after another without 
being very fully aware of the fact that he is introducing 
modifications, until finally by some fortunate accident he 
succeeds in hitting upon a relatively economical method of 
doing the work. Satisfied with this accidental adjustment, 
he now goes on working in that way and makes the adjust- 
ment more and more fixed by his constant repetition of it. 
In an earlier connection it was pointed out that there is 
little or no motive in practical life for any consideration 
of the details of such an adjustment. We see accordingly 
in many practical activities trial and error with little or no 
analytic thought. 
HieHER Forms or LEARNING 
Contrast with all of these examples of trial and error the 
way in which an intelligent man proceeds to deal with a 
new situation. Let us assume for the moment that a man 
has been caught as was the animal which we used in an 
earlier illustration. The man in the trap sits down and 
carefully considers every phase of the situation. If he 
should begin to run around as the animal does, trying now 
this point of attack and now that, we should say of him 
that he is unintelligent; but his deliberate consideration 
of the total situation marks him as an intelligent man, and 
his intellectual processes are evidently being appealed to 
as important means of extricating him from the difficulty 
in which he finds himself. The way in which the man is 
using his mental experiences in this case may be described 
somewhat as follows: He first takes into his conscious life 
the situation that lies before him. He sees with his eyes or 
hears with his ears or feels with his hands the situation.as 
   
-P-A-G-E-287
  
MANUAL SKILL 277 
it now stands. He then proceeds to concentrate his atten- 
tion upon the different elements of this situation. He does 
not try to move these elements themselves, but he fixes 
his attention upon certain aspects of the situation as these 
appear in his mind. We have described this sort of proc- 
ess in an earlier connection as an analysis of the situation. 
We may now put the matter in this form: The individual 
has a conscious process which is a legitimate substitute for 
the objects about him, and he works over this conscious 
process preparatory to dealing with the practical situation. 
Having now analyzed the situation in his own conscious- 
ness, he brings to bear upon that phase of the situation 
which seems to him to be the most worthy of attack all 
of the memories and experiences of the past. He says to 
himself: “There is no use in trying to get out in that direc- 
tion, because the bars are evidently much too strong. There 
is no use in trying to do anything here, because the wall is 
too compact and thick. I can, however, by putting together 
these and these pieces of wood that I find on the other side 
of the cage get to a point where I may be able to reach 
over the wall.” This mental process of rearranging expe- 
riences in the mind before one attempts to deal with the 
outside world shows the great advantage of mental read- 
justment over physical readjustment. It is proper to say that 
one tries a great many experiments in his imagination, and 
in a sense it is legitimate to call that also a method of trial 
and error; but the point is, this kind of trial and error which 
one carries on in consciousness is very economical as con- 
trasted with the kind of trial and error which the animal 
exhibits when -he goes from point to point in the trap and 
makes futile efforts to attack now this and now that part 
of the situation. Man has created for himself a world of 
imaginary experiences in the midst of which he tries to work 
out adjustments. He tries to see whether new elements 
of experience may be piled together; and if his conscious 
 
-P-A-G-E-288
  278 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
efforts at readjustment satisfy his mind, he may then later 
try to realize in the external world these readjustments which 
he has worked out first of all in his conscious imagination. 
LANGUAGE A GENERAL INSTRUMENT OF APPLICATION 
Thus far in describing the thought-processes of the 
intelligent man we have spoken in terms which did not 
clearly depict these processes as forms of behavior. The 
form of activity which is indispensable for such considera- 
tions as we have been describing is language. The man 
talks matters over with himself. He tries now this formula, 
now that. When he says to himself, “The wall is too 
strong,” he is classifying his present visual experiences 
under the whole of his past experience, and that past ex- 
perience has been marked and deposited for future use 
with the label “strong.” The very power of discrimination 
by which he turns attention, now to this point, now to 
that, depends on his use of words as guides to his mental 
processes. Discrimination, comparison, recall of experi- 
ences, classification of experiences, are not terms which 
imply lack of action. On the contrary, every one is an 
active term, and the chief instrument of human life in 
each of these processes is language. 
In short, language is the means which man has devised 
of rearranging his ideas. He first developed language as 
an instrument of social relations. He took up the facts of 
experience and passed them on to his neighbor. But very 
soon he found that a mode of behavior which would shift 
ideas from mind to mind might advantageously be used for 
private ends as well as social, and so man turned language 
into a means of private adaptation. Language is a means 
of self-adjustment, an instrument of personal recoil upon 
one’s own mental material. It is an active instrument for} 
assorting and rearranging ideas.
-P-A-G-E-289
  
MANUAL SKILL 279 
Puay oF IDEAS 
There is something very fascinating about the readjust- 
ment of ideas in one’s own mind. The little child enjoys 
putting ideas together just because he finds ideas so easy 
to rearrange. He finds the real world, which he pushes 
around with his hands, very stubborn. So he puts together 
ideas with all the freedom of limitless possibilities of re- 
adjustment. Some day he will learn the hard lesson that 
this free putting together of ideas is sometimes useless 
and often worse than useless as a preparation for practical 
life. Mere facility in recombinations of ideas is not the 
final goal of verbal training. 
Come back to our man caught in a trap. He wants to 
distribute his ideas with a view to preparing for escape. 
Escape means movement of hands and legs. Consideration 
means rearrangement of ideas with the aid of language. It 
will be well for our prisoner if he has learned to rearrange 
ideas and use words in such a way that he can guide his 
practical behavior by his carefully considered plans. It will 
be well for him if he has cultivated such a control of his 
hands and legs that they can ultimately turn into practical 
acts what his verbal considerations have worked out in his 
mind. In short, there is a higher form of adjustment than 
that exhibited either in gross bodily movements or in the 
finer movements of articulation. The two forms of behavior 
must be made to influence and promote each other. 
ERROR IN REARRANGING IDEAS 
This has been the great struggle of human thought. 
Often the inner reaction is fantastic, unpractical, unsafe as 
a guide to life. The result is that many people profess to 
be skeptical about the value of intelligent readjustments. 
The race as a whole, however, has undoubtedly reached 
   
-P-A-G-E-290
  
  280 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
an entirely different conclusion. Human experience differs 
from animal experience in the fact that human experience 
is primarily an experience based upon theoretical considera- 
tions and readjustments. The man who is about to do a 
piece of work sits down and plans it carefully, because the 
race has found that it is on the whole very much more 
economical in point of material and in point of energy to 
proceed after one has made a very careful plan. 
When one reaches on such grounds the conclusion that 
it is desirable to develop a relation between practice and 
theory, and when one bears in mind the conclusion which 
has been emphasized through this chapter and earlier 
chapters, —that there is a fundamental difference between 
theoretical processes and practical processes, — he sees that 
there is an important problem in education in developing 
the power of translating theory into practice and practice 
into theory. Theory is not identical with practice nor 
does the existence of practical experience insure theoreti- 
cal insight. Consequently, in the school one must make 
an effort to bridge over the chasm between the two. We 
must say to the student who has studied physics that he 
ought. to try to work out some of the principles of physics 
in a practical way, and we may say to the student of me- 
chanics in the shop that it is his business to understand 
the theoretical principles under which he does his work. 
It is not necessary for the student to work out the relation 
between theory and practice in every possible case. If he 
can work out a few simple cases he will be in possession 
of a principle of transition from theory to practice, and the 
reverse, which will stand him in good stead in many new 
situations where this transition from the one type of ex- 
perience to the other must be worked out. The ordinary 
school has long realized the importance of making the 
transition from theory to practical applications. In almost 
every course of training we find some effort to show the 
 
-P-A-G-E-291
ee ee ee ee ree eee ee Cree ee eee 
MANUAL SKILL 281 
student the avenues of such application. We have not 
taken advantage, however, to the extent which we might, 
of the possibility of developing science in the presence of 
practical experience through analysis of this experience. We 
have taught physics and told students that the mechanical 
world is based upon physics. We have not developed fully 
the practice of teaching students how to make something 
with tools and then to subject this activity to the analysis 
which will make them aware of the way in which theory 
can be attached to industry. 
Union oF THEORY AND PRACTICE 
If now we can realize as the outcome of our study of 
the relation between theory and practice the importance of 
moving back and forth from theory to practice and from 
practice to theory, and if we can realize that this movement 
backward and forward between the two forms of experi- 
ence must be made a matter of explicit endeavor in the 
school, we shall have added to our course of study an im- 
portant series of exercises which are neither purely theo- 
retical on the one hand nor purely practical on the other. 
No school can accomplish this purpose without including 
in its program both verbal reactions and hand reactions. 
Schools have long tried the experiment of inculcating 
theory and relying on later life to supply the opportunities 
for application, but the outcome has been unsatisfactory. 
If one thinks of industry as a training school in which 
skill is emphasized to the entire neglect (in most cases) of 
science, again the pitiful plight of the worker in a modern 
factory bears testimony to the unsuccess of a training which 
omits theory. We come back to the conclusion that the 
school must include both theory and practice for the sake 
of producing that highest type of human experience — 
a single comprehensive union of theory and practice. 
 
-P-A-G-E-292
    282 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
DIFFICULTIES ARISING OUT OF SPECIALIZATION 
This is a lesson which must be taken to heart on both 
sides of the discussion. The teacher of science must not 
refuse to deal with shop work, nor can the teacher of 
manual training get on without science. The two must 
work together. That there has been lack of sympathy in 
the past is due to the fundamental, psychological differ- 
ences between theoretical and practical activity. The two 
types of activity may grow up apart from each other. 
Often the manual-arts teacher illustrates this fact in his 
lack of knowledge of science. He does not know enough 
of mechanical science to state the facts of experience which 
would be encountered in the shop in the formulas of 
mechanical science. Furthermore, he is very frequently so 
absorbed in the practical adjustment of the tools to certain 
types of material that he does not realize the possibilities 
of a scientific study of the facts with which he is dealing. 
He very frequently expresses loudly his opposition to the 
use of books and stigmatizes language as an unworthy 
form of expression. Conversely, the student of science 
shows a like onesidedness when he looks down upon hand- 
work as unworthy of recognition in the schools. For him 
handwork is an unintellectual form of endeavor. It has 
no relation whatsover to thought-processes which are of 
a high and elevated type. 
‘When the student of science and the student of manual 
training have to meet in the faculty meetings for the pur- 
pose of deciding how students shall be trained, each makes 
an effort to secure as much time for his special line of 
work as possible; and each regards it as highly desirable that 
the other’s subject should be limited to as short a period 
as is consistent with the popular demand for variety in the 
high-school course. If one should propose to a manual- 
training teacher that part of the time in his course be given
-P-A-G-E-293
  
MANUAL SKILL 283 
to training in the theory of mechanics, he would probably 
reply that the student gets too much theory now, and what 
is needed is some practical contact with real things. Con- 
versely, if the student of physics were urged to do a little 
manual training in the physics laboratory, he would prob- 
ably offer as a substitute the conventional laboratory ex- 
periments in which the apparatus has been carefully made 
in some distant city and so arranged that the student 
can hardly fail to set up the different pieces in the way 
intended by the manufacturer. The school thus actually 
fosters the divorcement between theory and practice. 
There is another element of the situation which exagger- 
ates this separation between the two subjects. Both sub- 
jects are supposed to accomplish as much as possible within 
their own fields. The teacher feels pressed for time because 
in the manual-training shop he must introduce the student 
to fourteen different tools and to several projects which 
belong in his particular course. The teacher of physics 
has a textbook in hand and must get over the work in 
some fashion or other inside of a year. It makes no differ- 
ence at all to either of these teachers that the student will 
have to live after he finishes that particular year’s course ; 
and it does not seem to be very significant in the thought 
of either one of these teachers that the student will prob- 
ably forget something over three fourths of what he has 
learned in either course. A readjustment which would 
spend half of the time in each of these courses, actually 
making the transition in the student’s mind from theory 
to practice, or the reverse, would undoubtedly be in the 
long run economical of the student’s mental energy, and 
would make available for later life the small residuum 
of experience which is all that he can possibly carry away 
from either course. 
      
                                                        
 
-P-A-G-E-294
    284 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
CoRRELATION OF SCIENCE AND THE MANUAL ARTS 
The readjustment here recommended is by no means as 
fanciful as it may seem to some who have not considered 
the possibilities of working out such a combination. The 
effort has been made, with a good deal of success, in one 
of the German schools to make a combination of manual 
training and physics which shall be advantageous to both 
subjects. Professor Freeman has made available in English 
a description of this experiment, in a review of the German 
book, setting forth the course in detail.t 
Furthermore, the spirit of this suggestion has been real- 
ized on a large scale in a number of experiments which are 
being tried in this country at the present time; namely, the 
experiments with part-time classes, which attempt to unite 
school work of the traditional sort with shop work carried 
on by students. In these part-time schemes the student is 
in school during one week or during one month, and dur- 
ing the following week or month is engaged in practical 
industrial work. The business of the school in this case is 
not to duplicate the work of the shop, but rather to bring to 
bear on the problems of the shop the science and mathematics 
and reading which the student would miss if he were en- 
grossed altogether in the practical industries. On the other 
hand, it is recognized that his reading and his study are 
taken up more enthusiastically because in his shop work he 
is constantly in the presence of practical problems which 
stimulate him to see the importance of his school studies.”

CHAPTER XIII 
INDUSTRIAL COURSES 
Ris—E AND DEVELOPMENT OF COMMERCIAL COURSES 
With the rapid growth of industrial education during 
recent years, there have appeared numerous psychological 
problems which can perhaps best be introduced by describ- 
ing the observations which one makes when he goes into 
the classes where work of this sort is being given. The 
earliest industrial courses to be organized in American high 
schools were the so-called commercial courses. Before the 
economic pressure was felt which is now driving the schools 
and the public at large to recognize the importance of. 
training in the trades, there was a demand for clerks who 
could take charge of the shipping activities of the country. 
For a long time the United States has exported enormous 
amounts of raw material. This country has not needed, 
therefore, skilled laborers to make up its materials so much 
as shipping clerks and agents who could supervise trans- 
portation. At first the demand for clerks was met by 
the organization of special schools entirely outside of the 
control of the public boards of education. Even to-day we 
have a large number of private business colleges. Some- 
thing of the character of these institutions can be gathered 
from the special report prepared by the Chicago City Club 
on the private institutions in Chicago.! In general it is 
shown in this report that the effort of these institutions is

the Committee on Public Education of the City Club of Chicago (Part III), 
Published by the City. Club of Chicago, 1912. 
es,
-P-A-G-E-296
286 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
to give in the shortest possible time those essential forms 
of training which are required to bring the students into 
commercial offices. 
There can be no doubt at all that these institutions have 
discovered some of the most efficient methods for training 
students rapidly in business methods. They criticize the 
public schools for the long general courses which are re- 
quired of students, and undoubtedly secure a large part 
of their patronage because many people are convinced of 
the validity of these criticisms. 
The example of these numerous private business schools, 
together with the urgent demand on the part of students 
that they be equipped to enter profitable business engage- 
ments immediately upon graduation, has led to the wide- 
spread organization of various kinds of commercial courses 
in the high schools of this country. 
EmpHAsis ON RApip ExEcUTION 
If one attends the classes conducted by the commercial 
departments, as for example the classes in bookkeeping or 
business arithmetic or the exercises in stenography and 
typewriting, he finds that the methods of procedure are 
radically different from the methods of procedure which 
are common in the other courses administered in the school. 
One of the first ends of these courses is to secure rapid 
execution. The student is brought, as soon as he enters 
the course, to realize that one of the urgent demands of the 
business world is speed. In business arithmetic many of 
the short methods of work which are given to students are 
not explained with a view to a full comprehension of the 
scientific side of the subject. There is no time for a com- 
plete scientific explanation, and the student is not called 
upon. to deal with this aspect of the matter. Bookkeeping 
also is, for the most part, taught as a series of conventions.
-P-A-G-E-297
INDUSTRIAL COURSES - 287 
Those who take the course are impressed with the necessity 
of carrying out the work exactly as it is planned in the 
models which they use rather than with the necessity of 
understanding the fundamental reasons why this particular 
method of procedure is economical. 
If one reads the literature on typewriting, for example, 
he finds that there is very little discussion of the reason 
why a certain position of the hand or a certain course of 
training is economical. The student is directed what to do, 
but even the teacher does not understand the reason for 
the formula. In one recent publication on typewriting, the 
question of the best position of the hand is discussed. 
Should one always go back to the home key in order that 
he may locate the other keys from this point of reference, 
or should there be a general position of the hand which is 
free from definite reference to any single point? There 
seems to be no evidence beyond the testimony of certain 
interested observers, and this testimony is not carefully 
worked out in any exact way. This problem could, of 
course, be definitely solved by simple experiments. 
EMPHASIS ON IMITATION OF BUSINESS CONDITIONS 
A further general characteristic of these commercial 
courses is their effort to cultivate, so far as possible, condi- 
tions that are exactly similar to those which appear in the 
industries. One finds in the commercial department that 
the furniture is made to approximate, as far as possible, the 
furniture of business offices. | It seems necessary in teaching 
the forms of banking to have the physical paraphernalia of 
a bank as well as the general problems that confront that 
kind of an institution. 
Perhaps no clearer evidence of this disposition to demand 
conditions that are like those of the business world can be 
found than that given in the reiterated statements that 
   
-P-A-G-E-298
  288 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
business training and knowledge of the details of business 
operations are absolutely essential in the training of the 
teacher. This statement applies not only to the commercial 
courses, which were the original courses introduced in the 
high schools, but also in more emphatic form to all of the 
technical courses, which are rapidly following in the train 
of the commercial courses. A recent bulletin! issued by the 
National Society for the Promotion of Industrial Education 
lays great stress on the practical training of the teacher. 
THE TRAINING OF TEACHERS 
In discussing the qualifications of industrial-school teach- 
ers, this report lays great stress upon actual contact with 
trade. ¢ 
The shop instructor must know his trade as fully as does a 
skilled journeyman: and in addition, must have knowledge of 
the technical methods in use in the trade together with the 
command of its drawing, mathematics, science and art. (P. 27.) 
Even the teacher who has charge of subjects that are 
related to the strictly technical subjects is described as 
follows : 
The ideal teacher of related subjects whom, admittedly, in 
practice it would be difficult to secure in large numbers, should 
have trade equipment.... (P. 28.) 
Experience as a wage earner is an asset, as it enables one to 
gain a sympathetic insight into the needs of the worker, to 
understand the aims and purposes of the industrial school and 
its responsibility for the pupil and to the industry.... (P. 29.)

-P-A-G-E-299
INDUSTRIAL COURSES 289 
InpDIvipuAL InstRUCTION 
Another characteristic of the commercial course which 
is very conspicuous to the observer is to be found in the 
fact that the work is very largely individual in character. 
The class in typewriting is not a social organization as is the 
class in history or science. Each member of the class is ac- 
quiring personal skill and is allowed to progress at a rate 
which is in keeping with his own development. He goes 
over a certain number of routine exercises, and as soon as 
he can produce a perfect copy of one of the exercises he is 
allowed to progress to the next. Whether the other mem- 
bers of the class are keeping pace with him or not is a 
matter of indifference. The amount of recitation which 
one hears in the commercial department is relatively slight. 
The same statement may be repeated with regard to the 
technical courses carried on in the shop. 
ANTITHESIS BETWEEN CONVENTIONAL COURSES AND 
INDUSTRIAL COURSES 
All of these examples, as well as the general discus- 
sions of the problem of industrial education which have 
recently been presented, emphasize the fact that there is a 
distinction between the ordinary school procedure and the 
procedure which is appropriate as one turns to a study of 
industry.! | 
This antithesis between industrial courses and the ordi- 
nary courses of the school program is not a mere matter of 
school organization. It implies a fundamentally divergent

conception of the mental processes which are to be devel- 
oped in students and of the way in which society’s demands 
are to be presented to the growing individual. 
Let us consider briefly the psychological consequences of 
some of the characteristics of industrial courses which have 
been mentioned above. In the first place, what is the result 
of requiring that an act be performed at the highest possible 
speed? All that was said in the chapter on the psychol- 
ogy of skill about the difficulty of recognizing the sensa- 
tions which one employs in controlling his activities is 
pertinent to this discussion. If one has to work at a high 
rate of speed, his attention must always be concentrated 
upon the results of his work and he has little or no oppor- 
tunity to study his methods of procedure. Furthermore, 
there is little disposition to call in question those modes 
of procedure which have been found in earlier practice to 
serve the purpose. 
Tue RELATION oF ScrentiFic Stupiss In INDUSTRY 
Industry is seeing the importance at the present time of 
setting aside certain of its agents to examine very carefully 
the way in which workingmen move during each of the 
processes of their labor. These so-called efficiency experts 
are finding that the product which heretofore has been 
regarded by commercial concerns as entirely acceptable is 
ordinarily produced in a relatively uneconomical way. The 
standards of commerce up to this time have been the stand- 
ards of a general average of mediocre types of activity. 
The efficiency expert finds that by careful analysis of some 
of these mediocre and relatively clumsy forms of activity 
he can produce a more efficient form of behavior. He brings 
into the commercial world an entirely new psychological atti- 
tude. It is the attitude of analyzing one’s movements for 
the purpose of improving the moyements themselves. To be 
   
-P-A-G-E-301
INDUSTRIAL COURSES 291 
sure, the ultimate aim is an output which shall be cheaper 
and perhaps better than that which has been produced by 
the earlier methods. But the psychology of the situation is 
that for the time being attention is turned to the process 
itself, and this is made a subject of careful analytical study. 
No clearer evidence could be found than this to show 
that there is a difference between the ordinary commercial 
attitude and the intellectual attitude which is common to 
science. The difficulty with a careful scientific study of 
one’s behavior is that it impedes the progress of the activity 
for the time being. One cannot deliberate about his activi- 
ties and work with the speed that is required in practical, 
competitive commerce. The laborer, therefore, is trained 
not to deliberate about his activities, but to go forward at 
the highest possible rate of speed. The business of the 
class which is to train the worker is thought of in the same 
spirit, and is held to consist in pointing out some of the 
methods of work which will bring the worker more promptly 
to the result and will suppress in his mind any inquiries 
as to the grounds for these different forms of behavior. He 
cannot be both a scientist and an efficient laborer in the short 
period of time which society has allotted him for his training. 
The psychologist finds himself confronted here by one of 
those large social questions which it is not possible for him 
to deal with inside the limits of his special science. How 
the individual is to get time for a scientific examination of 
commercial processes and likewise fill his place in the world 
as an efficient laborer is indeed a difficult social problem. 
So long as our manufacturing concerns are organized at 
the level of competition which is common at present, and 
so long as the diversities of human nature are as great as 
they are, the probabilities seem large that a uniform atten- 
tion to analysis of processes on the part of all students will 
hardly be attained in education. But if society is to make 
a distinction between its members, and if the methods of  
-P-A-G-E-302
  292 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
training the different members of society are to be sharply 
differentiated, there ought to be a clear consciousness on 
the part of teachers of the effects on personality of these 
social stratifications. For example, if it is contended that 
commercial courses are good for everybody, the antithesis 
between commercial methods and scientific methods ought 
certainly to be borne in mind. If, on the other hand, the 
commercial courses are to be administered to a part of 
the school population and not to another part, again there 
should be a perfectly clear knowledge on the part of all 
that the distinction is a psychological distinction and not 
merely a distinction of specialized subject matter or content. 
ACADEMIC STANDARDS AND PRACTICAL STANDARDS 
Again, let us consider the psychological difference be- 
tween the standards which are set up in the ordinary 
academic courses and the commercial courses. As indi- 
cated above, there is always an appeal in commercial 
courses to the standards accepted in the business world. 
The academic world is supposed by the business world to 
be very lax in its standards. Possibly this criticism of the 
academic world can be removed in a measure by calling 
attention to the fact that the teacher always has a sliding 
scale of standards, which he applies with reasonable dis- 
crimination to the different stages of development of his 
students. One can be very complacent, for example, with 
a little child who is just beginning to read if he does not 
read with accuracy and fluency. The standards of the first 
grade in reading are relatively low as contrasted with the 
standards which are set in the upper grades. In the same 
way one is very complacent in educational institutions with 
the German sentence which is formulated by a student who 
has been studying German for two semesters. No one asks 
of a student of this degree of maturity in the schools that
-P-A-G-E-303
INDUSTRIAL COURSES 293 
he pay attention chiefly to the results of his work. The 
teacher is always more or less aware of the fact that the 
student’s mental activity is being perfected even through 
the errors which he commits. The teacher constantly dis- 
counts, therefore, the actual product of a student’s work, 
making allowances for his immaturity. 
Commercial teachers and trade teachers, on the other 
hand, are likely to be very intolerant of mistakes. They 
do not make any careful study of the student’s mental 
processes which, in many cases, explain the mistakes. Any 
one who has seen a shop teacher send a boy back to the 
task of making over his work, without a word of expla- 
nation as to the way in which he may improve it, will 
realize that in many of our shop courses commercial stand- 
ards are imposed upon the workers with a good deal of 
vigor, but with little tolerance for their immaturity. In fact, 
this is supposed to be one of the virtues of shop courses. 
There is no parleying with students about their loose meth- 
ods and inefficient work. They must come up to the com- 
mercial standards by some means or other. Unless they do 
reach these standards, their work will be ruthlessly rejected 
and they will have pointed out to them their lack of prepa- 
ration for actual contact with the real world. 
Not all commercial teachers are open to this type of 
criticism ; but enough of them would be quite willing to 
accept the description of their methods given above to jus- 
tify the statement that there is a marked opposition between 
the methods adapted in teaching ordinary academic subjects 
and the methods of commercial and trade courses. Whether 
the one method of procedure or the other is the most advan- 
tageous from an educational point of view must, of course, 
be determined by an empirical study of the effects of each 
method upon students. The psychologist is probably better 
acquainted with the effects of the ordinary academic meth- 
ods of teaching students, and he notes with interest that 
   
-P-A-G-E-304
  294. PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
the tendency of the academic world at the present time 
is to pay more and more attention to the mental processes 
through which students are passing. The movement toward 
supervised study in all of the academic institutions is one 
of the most significant movements in current education. 
Unless industrial teachers also recognize the value of super- 
vised teaching, it is likely that the breach between their 
courses and methods and the ordinary academic courses 
will grow wider rather than be eliminated. 
SPECIALIZATION 
A further psychological principle which emerges from 
our examination of the practical courses is the principle 
that industry tends toward specialization. We are urged to 
prepare brief courses in even the academic subjects which 
shall eliminate all of the matter that is not relevant to the 
industrial expectations of the student. 
In these continuation schools one of the most significant 
arrangements is the close correlation of the theoretical founda- 
tions of each trade with the instruction in the processes of the 
trade. That is to say, the mathematics of the school is the 
mathematics of the shop, whether it is jewelry or shoemaking 
or carpentry. The same is true of the machinist’s mathe- 
matics. Similarly the drawing of the school is the drawing of 
the shop. The problems which the boy finds in the shop to-day 
are dwelt upon at length in the school to-morrow. In the same 
way the closest possible relations of the sciences, physical or 
biological, to the trade concerned are maintained. The youth 
learns also the history of his trade, civics, and the proper use 
of his mother tongue in relation to his trade. 
This spirit of specialization is entirely intelligible when 
one studies the historical development of industry. Industry 
1P. H. Hanus, Beginnings in Industrial Education and Other Educa- 
tional Discussions, p. 20. Houghton Mifflin Company, 1908.  
-P-A-G-E-305
  INDUSTRIAL COURSES 295 
has always shown itself to be a progressive concentration 
upon particular types of material. If one wishes to borrow 
from the anthropologists a very striking illustration of this 
fact, he learns that for a long period of time man used only 
one substance, namely, stone, in all of his arts. The reason 
for this was that he had not discovered the value of other 
substances and probably was wholly complacent about the 
substance which he knew so familiarly. It takes an indus- 
trial concern a long while to make up its mind to change 
from one material with which it is familiar to some other 
material which is less familiar. It takes a long while in any 
business operation to persuade men to change their methods 
of procedure. Industry is conservative ; and the student who 
gets a training of an industrial type is likely to be conserva- 
tive to the extent of excluding from his psychological inter- 
ests practically all of the concerns which do not bear directly 
upon the one mode of operation that is familiar in his field. 
’ CONSEQUENCES OF SPECIALIZATION 
This high degree of specialization within any given in- 
dustry explains in a measure why industry and science 
have always been relatively aloof from each other. Industry 
is so conservative that it does not seek to discover the 
possibilities of change which lie all about it. Science, on 
the other hand, with its keen interest in the extension of 
investigation into new fields, is constantly working out 
principles without attempting to apply these principles to 
practical situations. Science is an expression of human in- 
terest in exploration; industry is an expression of human 
interest in the conservation of material and the conser- 
vation of energy. Science and industry have, therefore, 
been very inert in seeking relations with each other. One 
reads in books on education the broad, optimistic statement 
that knowledge grows with the evolution of industry and
-P-A-G-E-306
  296 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
that training in intellectual ways will make more efficient 
workmen. Even a superficial knowledge of the history of 
the race makes it clear that, so far as the individual and 
his training are concerned, there is no ground for this opti- 
mism that industry and science will codperate. In the long 
run society, as a whole, does develop both industry and 
science; and in the long run these two types of experience 
encounter each other and modify each other’s points of 
view. But the union of the two types of interest and the 
two types of training is one of the most difficult problems 
of modern civilization. 
Is THERE TO BE SPECIALIZATION IN ORGANIZATION ? 
These facts explain the bitter controversies that have 
arisen in recent years in educational circles with regard to 
the organization and administration of industrial education. 
There is a party of educators — and they are supported by 
practical business men — who believe that it is quite impos- 
sible to organize industrial education under the same roof 
with general education. They believe that the methods of 
industrial education are radically different from those of 
ordinary education. They believe that the spirit of these 
courses is at variance with the spirit of traditional school 
work ; that a new and unhampered effort to turn human 
interests in the direction of industry is the only salvation 
for our times. 
APPLICATIONS MUST BE CONSCIOUSLY DEVELOPED 
The psychologist sees in these contentions in favor of a 
separate organization of industrial courses not a complete 
and discriminating analysis of the situation, but a violent 
partisan expression of the psychological facts which all 
along have been exhibited in the history of science and
-P-A-G-E-307
INDUSTRIAL COURSES 297 
industry. The psychologist’s solution for the situation is 
one which calls for the development of that higher form 
of intellectual mastery which, in an earlier chapter, has 
been called the power of application. That the power of 
application is neither abstract science on the one hand 
nor specialized industry on the other has been fully stated 
in these earlier paragraphs and may be left at this point 
without a review of the psychological grounds which 
were there presented. 
New VocATIONAL CouURSES FOR GIRLS 
There are plenty of illustrations within the school or- 
ganization which could be added to that earlier, theoretical 
discussion in support of the conclusion that science and in- 
dustry find it very difficult to merge in the school program. 
Most of the examples which we have used up to this point 
are examples that relate to the training of boys. Let us 
choose for the present discussion an example that relates 
to the training of girls. 
High schools have recently taken on, in increasing de- 
gree, courses in domestic art and domestic science, it being 
clearly recognized that, whatever occupation a girl is to 
enter immediately after her school training, she will inevi- 
tably look forward to the ultimate vocation of conducting 
a hoysehold. So universally has this demand for domestic 
courses been recognized that there has been less question 
about the introduction of these courses into the school 
program than about the introduction of any of the other 
vocational courses. There has been the most sincere effort 
to articulate these courses with the rest of the work of 
the school. Furthermore, since cooking involves certain 
changes that are chemical in type, the suggestion naturally 
came very early in the development of the domestic courses 
that the cooking courses should be articulated as intimately 
   
-P-A-G-E-308
    298 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
as possible with the courses in chemistry. The result is 
that we see the most extraordinary efforts to make cook- 
ing a science like the science of chemistry. We see, on the 
other hand, equally extraordinary efforts to make chemistry 
practical for the girl who is studying cooking. 
FAILURES IN THE EFFORT TO CORRELATE SCIENCE 
AND PRACTICAL COURSES 
Any examination of the actual situation in high schools 
and colleges will make the unbiased observer perfectly 
clear that this effort at articulation of chemistry and cook- 
ing has been a huge failure. What commonly happens is 
that a course in organic chemistry or a general course in 
chemistry is administered with the usual paraphernalia 
of laboratory exercises and with the usual demands of a 
strictly quantitative, scientific analysis. The girl is prom- 
ised, through the whole of this course, that she will get 
information which is indispensable for her cooking. She 
then goes to the cooking class and finds that the formulas 
in this class are loose and unquantitative. Then she finds 
that the chemical changes which go on in the ordinary food 
substances are by no means understood by her instructors 
or by any one who was interested in giving her the known 
facts of organic chemistry. She finds that there is a whole 
series of unsolved problems in cooking which are not prob- 
lems of chemistry at all, but problems of physics or problems 
of economics. Her confidence in her teacher who has been 
promising her applications of chemistry breaks down. She 
feels that there is no correlation between her cooking and 
the one subject where this correlation was definitely prom- 
ised, and consequently she gives up, in general, the effort 
to relate her cooking to the rest of her studies. 
Somebody ought to convince the teachers of domes- 
tic science that scientific methods can be applied to the
-P-A-G-E-309
INDUSTRIAL COURSES 299 
problems of the cooking laboratory quite as much as in any 
of the problems of chemistry which are studied in the ordi- 
nary elementary courses. The empirical facts which can be 
ascertained with regard to the changes that take place in 
meat while it is being roasted are just as important to the 
human race as any of the laboratory investigations in the 
chemistry course. A description of these changes under 
carefully organized, scientific conditions is good science 
and good mental discipline even if it is not to be classified 
as chemistry or physics in the ordinary sense of the term. 
The difficulty, educationally, in these cases is that the cor- 
relation has been sought on too narrow a basis. The effort 
to make industry scientific has started from the foundation 
of a conventional course in science, without recognizing 
the fact that this conventional course grew up historically 
without reference to the particular problems of cooking. 
The sudden effort to bring the two together without the 
creation of any intermediate system of ideas is destined, 
from the outset, to be a failure. The trouble here, as else- 
where in the school program, lies in the assumption that if 
a student is given two bodies of knowledge, the two will 
flow together in his mind and affect each other favorably ; 
whereas all school experience goes to show, beyond any 
peradventure, that two systems of knowledge given to a 
student are as unlikely to flow together in his mind as two 
streams on two sides of a watershed. 
CouRSES IN AGRICULTURE ILLUSTRATE THE DIFFICUL- 
TIES OF CORRELATION 
Another example of the extreme difficulty of working 
out correlations between science and industry is to be found 
in the recent experiments which have been undertaken in 
agricultural courses in the high school. A very large body 
of literature has been created on this topic and it would 
     
-P-A-G-E-310
  800 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
require a specialist to offer any valid judgments about the 
actual situation at the present time.! 
Quoting from the report by Robison, we see that it is the 
judgment of a specialist that the situation is not materially 
different from that which is described in connection with 
cooking and chemistry. i 
Agriculture is probably taught as well as other sciences in 
the same schools, but the deficiencies are more common on ac- 
count of the greater opportunity afforded to make concrete the 
principles of the various sciences. So much have the sciences 
been regarded as instruments of a disciplinary education, that 
the absence of concrete applications has not seemed to many to 
be such a marked defect. The pedagogy of agricultural instruc- 
tion must take account of the essentially utilitarian aspect of 
this subject. The philosophy underlying the method of instruc- 
tion is not consistent with that conception of education that to 
be cultural is to be useless; nor does agriculture in the schools 
depend for its justification on any supposed disciplinary values, 
not that it does not possess as much value in this direction as 
other studies, but agriculture as a study may justly claim to 
have a content of its own that is worth while. It does not need 
the prop of a disciplinary conception of education that bids fair 
to become obsolete. But if the administrator’s idea is to teach 
the art or trade of farming, his methods, while involving the 
idea of doing, will probably be those of purely imitative doing, 
and not calculated to cultivate initiative, to give opportunity 
for forming and correcting judgments, nor for acquiring a scien- 
tific habit of thought. Viewed as an education, agriculture 
should do all these things as truly as any other science is sup- 
posed to do. We must remember that we are teaching children 
as well as subjects. (P. 173.) 
We do not have to believe that the unrelated chemistry ex- 
periment is the only thing giving opportunity for making and

of the United States (Teachers College, 1911).
-P-A-G-E-311
INDUSTRIAL COURSES 301 
correcting judgments; nor is this the exclusive attribute of 
that particular kind of mathematical physics that is killing 
itself off except as bolstered up by college entrance require- 
ments. The contests between the disciplinarians and the phe- 
nomenologists tend to drive the latter class into an extreme 
and untenable position. The remark made recently that “ there 
are no methods of teaching above the grades” is not an indict- 
ment of the high school instruction and not of pedagogy. Even 
in the grades the current methods of carrying on garden work 
are not calculated to encourage initiative on the part of the 
child or to place any definite problems before him for solution. 
It is often only a sort of physical exercise that is better than 
gymnasium work because it is out of doors. (P. 175.) 
PROBLEMS OF APPLICATION AND DISCIPLINE 
This last quotation leaves us with two general psycho- 
logical problems which we must canvass more fully in later 
chapters. One of these problems has been emphasized 
throughout this chapter. It is the problem of relating sci- 
ence to industrial training. The second problem which is 
suggested by Mr. Robison is the general problem of mental 
discipline, to which he refers in the remark that this doctrine 
of education is rapidly becoming obsolete. We shall reserve 
for a general chapter the discussion of this topic. But we 
must take the opportunity of reiterating what was said in 
an earlier chapter. The ancient languages have borne, 
because of their completely developed form, a very large 
burden of the discussion of the general doctrine of formal 
discipline. Everywhere through the course of study this 
problem turns up as an important problem. Does one sub- 
ject have a bearing upon other subjects in the course of 
study ? Does the mental attitude which a child cultivates 
in one sphere of experience affect his mental life in other 
spheres? We have seen how entirely possible it is for sci- 
ence and industry to be separated from each other in the 
 
-P-A-G-E-312
302 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
history of the race and in the experience of the individual. 
We have had occasion to call attention to the grave educa- 
tional problem which arises out of this fact. We shall later 
see that any statement that subjects are not related to each 
other is of cardinal importance to the educator and cannot 
be dismissed by the mere assertion that at present relations 
do or do not exist. The important question for the student 
of education is how can school work be organized so as to 
gain as intimate a relationship as possible between the dif- 
ferent mental processes which the student cultivates. No 
educational scheme is adequately worked out which has 
to be characterized by the statement that two subjects are 
so remote from each other that one may go on developing 
without influencing the other. 
This chapter leaves us with a clearly defined problem. 
A solution of this problem can be reached only through 
further analyses of related subjects. 
 
-P-A-G-E-313
CHAPTER XIV 
SCIENCE 
DIFFICULTY OF ORGANIZING SCIENCE INSTRUCTION 
Throughout the last few chapters the implication that 
science cultivates a type of experience which is desirable has 
been expressed without any serious effort to justify the 
position assumed. When we turn to the school situation 
we find much to discourage the assumption that science is 
a successful element of the course of study. As was pointed 
out in the introductory chapter, twenty years ago there 
was the most unqualified optimism among those who were 
active in introducing science into school programs. They 
were emphatic in the assertion, which cannot be denied, 
that science lies at the foundation of modern industrial 
development. They called attention to the popular interest 
in scientific discovery and to the vast improvement and en- 
largement of the methods of research. They assumed that 
it would be easy to introduce students to science. Expe- 
rience has served to temper this optimism. During two 
decades the percentage of election of science courses has 
steadily decreased. Textbook after textbook has appeared 
and been discarded. High-school administrators say that 
the teaching in science is not as effective as the teaching in 
literary subjects. The various courses in the different sci- 
ences show no coherence, and the outcome in the way of 
practical applications made by students is so meager that 
the value of science teaching is, on every hand, seriously 
called in question. Certainly if any situation ever demanded 
careful examination, it is this failure of science to establish 
303 
   
-P-A-G-E-314
  804 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
itself in an age when science is popularly thought of as the 
most productive type of intellectual activity. 
The discoveries which have been made by science teachers 
during this period of discouragement may be summarized 
in the following statements. The scientific attitude of 
mind is by no means a simple attitude, and it is not one 
which is readily assumed by the immature thinker. The 
interest of the student in’ the things about him, which 
interest it was assumed would. prepare him for science, is, 
as a matter of fact, utterly unscientific and so far from 
furnishing the basis for scientific study that in many cases 
it creates a prejudice against science. While science has 
had a powerful influence on industrial development, scien- 
tific thought and practical skill are not identical forms of 
mental activity. Indeed, science and skill are, as we have 
seen, the most diverse aspects of mental development. It is 
only in the later stages of the two that they are brought 
into productive relation. The psychological analysis of 
science teaching ought to make clear the reasons for the 
difficulties just mentioned and may suggest some methods 
of overcoming these difficulties. 
PRIMITIVE SCIENCE 
Some of the most suggestive psychological studies of 
science are those which deal with the beginnings of scientific 
thought among primitive peoples. The savage personified 
everything about him. If he heard a clap of thunder, it 
suggested to him the idea of a voice. If he saw the force 
and power of lightning, he thought of some personal agent 
behind the flash. The winds and waves and all the other 
activities of physical nature were for him personal forces. 
The psychology of these primitive views about nature 
is the psychology of a very simple kind of interpretation 
of new phenomena by familiar formulas. Man saw the
-P-A-G-E-315
SCIENCE 305 
phenomena of nature. His mind tended to relate what he 
saw with the personal experiences which were the familiar 
facts of his life. The most familiar part of the world was 
that made up of personal emotions and ideas. These per- 
sonal attributes he carried over and attached to the phe- 
nomena of nature. 
Not only was the association of ideas thus made domi- 
nated by personal experience, but the thinker was vaguely 
satisfied with any combination of ideas that comes into 
consciousness. The little child is in this respect like primi- 
tive man; neither one thinks of the difference between 
a true explanation and a mere fiction. In fact, if the fanci- 
ful explanation is full of people, it will be accepted by the 
immature thinker with the greatest interest. Little children 
pass, as did the race, through a period of personifying every- 
thing. Dolls and hobbyhorses, even chairs and empty rooms, 
take on personal characteristics and furnish the child’s mind 
with an unbounded opportunity of recombining personal ex- 
periences. The reconstructed personified world is for him 
just as real as the world of sensory colors and: sounds. 
Another way of stating the matter is to say that both the 
savage and the child feel the need for a fuller experience 
than that which is supplied at any moment by the senses. 
The child hears a voice, and is impelled by his desire for 
a fuller experience to look for the source of the voice. The 
child sees a color, and tries to get in contact with the object 
so that he may feel its hardness. The demand for a fuller 
experience is thus a natural expression of the demand of an 
active mind. In securing fuller experiences the child and 
the savage unhesitatingly supply ideas from memory. Many 
times, rather than trouble to look for the source of a sound, 
one thinks he knows and so supplies the idea needed to 
make the experience complete. There is, of course, in this 
supplying of elements from memory the largest possibility 
of error. The ideas drawn from memory follow the laws 
 
-P-A-G-E-316
  306 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
of the inner world, and it is not probable that the laws of 
the inner world will always agree with the laws of external 
reality. When, for example, the inner world follows the 
principle of personification, it gets so much out of harmony 
with the real facts of the physical world that we think of 
savage explanations as the sheerest fictions of inner fancy. 
And such they were. It was long generations before the 
mind was disciplined to carry out those elaborate and care- 
fully guarded forms of thought which constitute modern 
science. Science began with uncritical imaginings and has 
only gradually been disciplined into forms of thought in 
which the imaginings are brought into agreement with 
nature and made productive for the control of nature. 
ScIENCE BASED ON Motives OTHER THAN PRACTICAL 
It may be well at this stage of the discussion to dispose 
of a view which is often expressed in educational literature. 
It is said that science grew up as the handmaiden of 
industry. Nothing could be more untrue than this view. 
Primitive man had a set of explanations of the world 
which was immensely more elaborate than were his ideas 
in industrial matters. He used the stars to guide his ship 
or his caravan, but his science went very much beyond the 
study of the positions of the stars. His active mind peopled 
the firmament with grotesque monsters whose imagined 
shapes bound together the stars in constellations; and, 
pursuing a vain hope, he sought to determine his own 
future by the juxtaposition of the heavenly bodies. To say 
that early astronomy was a handmaiden of the art of navi- 
gation is to pervert immeasurably the history of science. 
Again, take the hunting ceremonies of primitive peoples. 
The peoples depended on game for their food and became

can learn from his unscientific guide the most interesting
-P-A-G-E-317
  
_ SCIENCE 307 
and important facts out of which to formulate a science of 
animal life. This is because the guide has much practical 
information and uses it in tracking game. But the guide 
is, in his own science, grotesquely crude and uncritical. The 
primitive hunter, when he sits down by the fire after the 
day’s hunt, lets his imagination have free rein. Then 
the prey which he tracks so skillfully during the day takes 
on all sorts of personal characteristics and goes through 
all kinds of unobserved and unobservable performances. 
The hunter is now a man of imagination. He is cultivating 
the powers of thought which some day will mature into criti- 
cal science, but at this stage he is limited by no restraints of 
mere observation and by no disposition to collect evidence 
before he enters upon the formulation of theory. 
IDEAS SHAPED PRACTICE RATHER THAN THE REVERSE 
The unrestrained speculations of primitive man are not 
turned in the direction of science by any effort at applica- 
tion. Indeed, the history of primitive custom shows exactly 
the reverse, how absurdly man shaped his practices to fit 
his theory. Think of the practices of sacrifice and religious 
propitiation. Primitive society put its members through 
the most onerous tasks to satisfy needs which were wholly 
of the imagination’s making. The history of these practices 
is to our modern minds like a fairy tale. They are, indeed, 
part of the fantastic world which man made in his own 
mind and substituted for the world of his senses. To 
understand primitive customs one has to study primitive 
myths. Thought was not controlled by practical adjust- 
ments. Quite the contrary, behavior was dominated by 
fantastic imagination.

CriticAL THOUGHT ARISES FROM SOCIAL RELATIONS 
The first revisions of primitive science came not from 
the efforts to reconcile practical behavior and thought, but 
rather from the clash of social groups. The history of the 
Greeks illustrates this in a very striking way. The various 
Greek tribes developed elaborate systems of mythology 
and elaborate systems of ceremonial practices. Each tribe 
was content to believe its own myths until tribe began 
to come into intimate relation with tribe. Then the clash 
of social opinion made men skeptical. There is nothing 
more jarring to one’s primitive scientific theories than to 
find that one cannot persuade his neighbor. So it was with 
the Greek thinkers. At first each developed his own views 
without restraint, but soon he met some one who had evolved 
other views. Now came the clash of wits which characterize 
that period of Greek skepticism that introduced the first 
great constructive period of Western thought. During the 
period of skepticism the Greeks learned that thought, to be 
productive, must be critical as well as imaginative. 
Not only does the thought of a whole tribe thus progress 
through social conflicts to a stage where criticism checks 
and organizes imaginations, but there appears during this 
social checking up of ideas a tendency for the thoughts of 
each individual to become more systematic and internally 
coherent. This is most conspicuous in those purely myth- 
ological systems such as the system of the Greek gods 
and goddesses. The system gradually cultivated a kind 
of inner coherence, and all new experiences which were 
allowed place in the system were made to conform to the 
general scheme. Indeed we find that the hierarchy of gods 
was made to conform more and more to a well-arranged 
human state, thus revealing not only system but a system 
of a very familiar type.
-P-A-G-E-319
SCIENCE 3809 
INTERNAL CONSISTENCY AS A LOGICAL CRITERION 
Thus the first principle of validity arises and gets a 
general social recognition. Thinking is regarded as valid 
when it is consistent with itself. There is no psychological 
demand at the outset for conformity with any external 
facts. All that is necessary is that ideas shall not contra- 
‘lict earlier ideas. : 
This criterion of internal consistency is the one which is 
used even to-day in testing much of our scientific thinking. 
[f the geologist has a theory with regard to the formation 
of the earth’s surface which he cannot test with reference 
to its actual agreement with external facts, he offers as 
evidence of the validity of his theory the criterion that 
his theory includes all that is known without presenting 
any internal inconsistencies. Indeed, one may say that the 
whole of formal logic is based on this criterion of internal 
consistencies. One may reason validly in non-Euclidean 
geometry where his assumptions are known from the first 
to be actually contrary to fact as observed. One may be 
mistaken in his premises but consistent in his inferences. 
To be sure, modern science has developed methods of test- 
ing premises as well as methods of testing processes of 
inference, but it is interesting to note that science is, in its 
attitude toward the criterion of consistency, very different 
from the so-called practical man. The man of science is 
willing to go through a long and laborious comparison of 
different ideas for the purpose of testing their internal 
coherency. The practical man, on the other hand, cuts 
short this comparison of ideas and resorts to the practical 
test. If the thing works, it is enough for him. If, on the 
other hand, it does not work, the practical man casts it aside, 
whatever may be its scientific probability. The scientist 
very frequently has to hold to the validity of his views, 
because they meet the criterion of internal consistency, for 
 
-P-A-G-E-320
  310 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
a long period before he is able to refine the instruments 
of demonstration far enough to persuade a practical man 
of the workableness of the theory. 
There is so wide a breach between practical tests of 
validity and the demand for consistency that at the outset 
the practical tests cut no figure. Primitive man was satis- 
fied when his stories held together, quite apart from their 
application in any way to practical life. It is only in the 
latest and most elaborate stages of science and industry 
that internal consistency and practical applicability are both 
recognized as equally valid methods of testing thinking. 
It is only when these two entirely different attitudes of 
mind and means of criticism are equally applied to thought 
that we get the highest productivity of thinking. For long 
generations the two types of criticism of truth were sepa- 
rated from each other. For example, the medieval theolo- 
gian cared not at all for practical applicability. Many a 
practical man cares not at all about theoretical consisten- 
cies. It is only the modern worker, trained in applying 
science to industry, who can see the importance of both 
criteria of validity. 
IMAGINATION RECONSTRUCTS ENVIRONMENT 
Another way of stating the same case and of reviewing 
the earlier discussion is to say that ideas may be put to- 
gether in the freest possible fashion. For primitive man 
the putting together of ideas was itself a pleasure quite 
apart from any use which could be made of these imagi- 
nations. The same is true in the personal experience of 
each of us. We all get pleasure out of pure imagination. 
We build castles in the air and construct in thought com- 
binations of ideas which satisfy our desires. It is much| 
easier to satisfy one’s desires in this thought world than in 
the world of actual reality. Indeed, so free is the thought}
-P-A-G-E-321
SCIENCE 311 
   
     
                                                               world from agreement with external things that very fre- 
quently it is difficult to see how free imaginations come to 
be disciplined into service in a world where men live and 
move under the limitations of external things. It is not 
until we realize that the ideas which one puts together 
freely in thought are capable of being used as models on 
the pattern of which to rearrange external reality that we 
see the possibility of uniting the two interests. It is one 
of the most striking characteristics of human life that man 
has turned upon his environment and has, through his in- 
dustrial and practical arts, remolded the environment to 
fit his ideas. Instead of changing himself to fit the external 
conditions of climate, as did the animals during the process 
of organic evolution, man has gone about changing the 
external conditions around him in such a way that he 
has freed himself from the necessity of changing his own 
physical characteristics. Anthropologists have long called 
attention to the fact that the physical changes which man 
has undergone in the course of his whole history are rela- 
tively very slight. Man, of to-day is not different in size 
and general physical equipment from man when he first 
appeared on the earth’s surface. The fact is, he has not 
been progressing physically during the period which an- 
thropology has studied. When we study his behavior 
we see that there is no reason why he should change 
physically. He has evolved a very much better plan of 
adaptation to his environment. He now reorganizes his 
surroundings. Instead of becoming strong in his own arms 
and legs he devises mechanical substitutes for his own 
weakness. Instead of learning how to fight the animal 
kingdom better, he takes the beasts into his service and 
domesticates those animals which will be of use to him in 
maintaining his own life. These processes of mechanical 
invention and of domestication of animals have been made 
possible through the fact that man was able in his own
-P-A-G-E-322
  312 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
thinking to rearrange the world and then by his actions 
to make the external world conform to the world which 
he had imagined. 
It is well, therefore, that the internal world of imagi- 
nation should be freer than the external world of things. 
It is because of the freedom with which man can readjust 
his inner world that he has been able to make his great 
strides in civilization. In this inner world of free recombi- 
nation of ideas man was at first without restraint of any 
kind. Then he came to demand internal consistency. All 
that he asked of his ideas at the beginning was that they 
should not disagree with each other. During this early 
period his ideas were not very useful; indeed, they often 
misled him. Later he realized the advantage that would 
come to him if he could accomplish in the external world 
what he thought of in the world of ideas. Then he began 
to try and test his imaginations by the possibilities of reali- 
zation in the external world. Now a new type of thought 
was created ; namely, experimental research. 
CriticaAL THINKING LATE IN DEVELOPMENT 
Such considerations explain how the transition gradually 
takes place from the first unsystematic imaginings of primi- 
tive man to the critical, systematic thought of the modern 
sciences. How slow this evolution has been one realizes 
when he remembers that not until the most modern period 
has science come to be the dominant mode of thought. 
Earlier centuries were speculative, theological, romantic. 
Only the last centuries have been scientific. We should 
keep in mind this slow development of science when we 
propose a course for the school. Can children learn to sub- 
stitute something better for their imaginations about the 
world? Can children learn the lesson of self-criticism ? 
Can children become systematic and at the same time
-P-A-G-E-323
  SCIENCE 313 
learn to conform their systems of thinking to the world 
of physical phenomena? The answer suggested by the 
history of science to these questions is not encouraging. 
The race learned scientific modes of thought very late and 
after a long period of intellectual struggle in which error 
dominated. How then shall the child escape some of these 
difficulties? When one recalls the fact that experimental 
methods are among the latest achievements of the race, 
he understands in a measure why the efforts of science 
teachers to introduce experimental methods into schools 
have met with a serious rebuff. 
SPECIALIZATION IN SCIENCE 
If we turn from the first beginnings of science and con- 
sider some of the later periods of its history, we shall realize 
more fully another cardinal difficulty in promoting scien- 
tific thought and teaching. Science, as a system of experi- 
ence, tends to become highly specialized. This is due to 
the fact that individuals who pursue one system of ideas 
for a time tend to become limited in thought and action 
to that one field of experience. The mind is narrow in its 
ranges of attention, and, whatever may be the possibilities 
of extension of any system of ideas, the tendency in the 
life of a single individual is to narrow all experience down 
to a single type. While society as a whole may be inter- 
ested in different systems of ideas, the individual tends to 
become a specialist. This tendency is so often exemplified 
that it seems unnecessary to offer illustrations in support 
of the above statement. The psychology of science as well 
as of industry would, however, be incomplete without great 
emphasis on this principle. 
It may be well, therefore, to consider one of the strik- 
ing examples of specialization which appears in the his- 
tory of science. The science of chemistry grew out of a 
 
-P-A-G-E-324
  314 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
semipractical and general interest. Men had long known 
the metals and were familiar with their uses and with many 
methods of treating them in art and industry. The the- 
ory, which we now know to be a pure fiction of human 
desire, that baser metals can be turned into gold, led men 
to make trials and to enter into the most elaborate schemes 
in order to make Nature conform to their theory. But 
Nature was stubborn, and as men worked to achieve their 
desired goal they became more and more conscious of the 
fact that Nature follows certain laws altogether different 
from those which human speculation had planned. The 
shock of disappointment was great, and some of those who 
had entered upon the search for the desired power to change 
metals gave up discouraged. Others became absorbed in a 
wholly new quest. Finding that Nature has her own laws, 
they began to inquire into these laws. So deeply did these 
searchers after Nature’s laws become immersed in their 
study that they lost contact with the world about them. 
They appear in history as a group of men devoted to a 
special search. They cultivated a language and a fraternity 
of their own. They did not ask about the uses which could 
be made of their findings. They were. bent only on enlarg- 
ing the one type of knowledge. This one type of knowledge 
became to them an absolutely engrossing interest, a religion. 
SPECIALIZATION DUE TO LIMITATIONS OF ATTENTION 
To the psychologist who reads the history of the begin- 
nings and the later development of chemistry the lesson is 
clear. The human mind is relatively narrow in its interests. 
Once a man becomes absorbed in a certain type and system 
of thought, he has no attention for anything outside the 
sphere of this one dominant interest. One needs only to 
go into any modern chemical laboratory to find descendants 
of the alchemists buried in their cult. The research chemist
-P-A-G-E-325
   SCIENCE 315 
turns his mind to the task of determining specific gravities 
and for him there is only one interest in life. He is an 
example of the narrow scope of human attention. Such a 
research man has no interest in industrial applications. He 
looks upon application of knowledge as a distraction. If 
one is to discover facts and the laws of chemical behavior 
of substances, he must think of these, and only these, day 
and night. When society at large looks in upon such a 
devotee of science at his work, it turns away with an un- 
canny feeling that he has ceased to be a part of. the normal 
human group. Most men have limits of attention that are 
narrower than those of the research student, but the com- 
mon narrowness of ordinary men seems broader because 
the ordinary man flits from problem to problem and gains 
in breadth of objects touched by scattering his limited 
powers in many directions. The research student holds 
to one group of facts and so stands forth convicted of 
human narrowness. 
DANGERS OF SPECIALIZATION 
The growth of specialization in modern civilization is 
one of the drawbacks of a highly scientific age. The physi- 
cist of to-day is likely to think slightingly of his fellows who — 
work in botany and zoédlogy. New sciences are always 
received with coldness. For example, the science of psy- 
chology is so different from the natural sciences in method 
and material that it has made its way slowly against the 
critical skepticism of these older sciences. The antithesis 
between applied science and theoretical science is sometimes 
emphasized to the point of bitterness. The only salvation 
in the situation is that society as a whole overcomes some 
of the narrowness of its individual members. The chem- 
ical researcher is supplemented by the practical man who 
dyes cloth and tans leather and makes:sugar. Society is
-P-A-G-E-326
    
316 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
gradually evolving special agencies to help her in overcom- 
ing the narrowness of specialists. She is evolving specialists 
whose business it is to bring to narrow-minded practical 
workers the results of the researches of narrow-minded 
students of science. These middlemen are sometimes un- 
able to get the sympathy of either group whose efforts they 
are trying to unify. Society needs the student of applied 
chemistry, however, and will doubtless be able to support 
him until his place in the scheme of human effort becomes 
established. 
The narrowness of specialization in the sciences is the 
source of one of the gravest problems of the modern school. 
How shall the student be put in contact with science and 
be shown the meaning of scientific method when the typical 
attitude of the scientist is narrow devotion to a single 
limited field? The high-school course of study of to-day 
shows how difficult is the answer. Shall there be short highly 
specialized science courses giving the student glimpses into 
each of the great divisions of science? Shall there be 
courses giving a few sample problems and solutions from 
biology and a like number from physics? Shall the student 
be given results, being told in the easiest possible way 
whai science has learned, or shall he be brought into the 
laboratory and guided in the discovery ? Shall he elect 
science after he finds out from his reading or through his 
endeavor to keep up with modern practical life that science 
would give him the typical modern view of the world, or 
shall he be required for the good of his soul to take some 
science whether he has learned to want it or not? Shall 
high-school science be exact and in its most final form, full 
of mathematical statements and rigid and complete in its 
demonstrations, or shall it aim to persuade the immature 
student to look at the world ina critical and systematic 
way? Shall we teach applications in the first stages of 
‘science, thus reversing the -history of science, or shall: we,
-P-A-G-E-327
  SCIENCE 317 
wait for applications until science is mature? These and a 
hundred other questions are difficult to answer because 
those in charge of science courses are narrow-minded like 
all human beings. 
THE NEED OF GENERAL STUDIES OF EDUCATIONAL 
SITUATIONS 
How narrow science makes one was illustrated in the 
writer’s hearing by a colleague who described the require- 
ments which a certain university department of physics was 
attempting to enforce upon graduates of that institution 
who wanted to secure recommendations to teach physics. 
The department wanted all intending teachers of physics 
in high schools to take three fifths of their courses in that 
department. It can be shown, and was shown in the case 
in question, that in no high school in that state could a 
teacher be found who taught physics alone. Physics, then, 
was only part of the rational preparation of the prospective 
teacher. Suppose the second subject to be a science. There 
would be no adequate margin in the student’s course for 
training on a like scale even in this second subject, to say 
nothing about the general courses in literature and history 
which it is commonly thought a student should pursue. 
THE NEED OF A GENERAL CURRICULUM OF SCIENCE 
CouURSES 
Another symptom of the limitation of the ordinary 
scientist’s horizon is seen in the fact that after all these 
years no one has devised a high-school course which ex- 
tends through a period of four years. Do the science 
people realize the enormous disadvantage to their subjects 
which results from their absorption in their specialties to 
such an extent that they cannot get together and agree as

to the advice which should be given to students about the 
proper sequence of science courses? The following table, 
compiled by Professor Caldwell from statistics given by 
G. W. Hunter,! shows the present chaotic state of the art 
of teaching science.

GENERAL SCIENCE AS AN INTRODUCTORY COURSE 
One suggestion which has been offered with reference 
especially to the first-year course is that a composite gen- 
eral course be organized including material from various 
special sciences. To be sure, the onlooker sees evidences 
of specialization even in these general courses. One of the 
general courses is based on physics and another on biol- 
ogy. The scientist has his specialty as his chief topic of 
attention even when he tries to be general. These courses 
in general science, whatever may be their virtues, are con- 
demned by most specialists as unscientific, and they are 
found by administrative officers to be difficult to keep alive 
because the supply of teachers of such courses seems to 
be short.

A Stupy or CHILDREN’S SCIENTIFIC INTERESTS 
The organization of other courses for various years has 
also been dominated very largely by the supposed interests 
of the science itself. Is it not time that scientific studies 
of the mental processes of students be substituted for a 
too absorbing devotion to scientific studies of physics and 
botany? One such study, made by Mr. Finley,! although 
it dealt with the interests of children in the elementary 
school, may be reported as furnishing the clearest evidence 
that there are successive stages of development in scientific 
interest. In the investigation in question objects were ex- 
hibited to children in the different grades of the elementary 
school for the purpose of determining the type and distribu- 
tion of their interests. In the first part of the experiment 
the children were shown a water animal, and their interests 
were tested by the questions they asked. In the second 
part of the experiment a plant and an animal were exhib- 
ited and a simple physical apparatus was demonstrated, 
and the interest was measured by the choice made by the 
children later of a subject on which to write. 
Two striking facts came out of the investigation. First, 
there is a radical change in the attitude of the children as 
we pass upward through the grades. In the earlier grades 
the interests of the children can be described as centered 
on mere identification or on purely personal relations. The 
questions asked were such as these: “ What is it?” “ May 
I touch it?” “ Will it bite?” Obviously these questions 
are not scientific at all. There is no interest indicated in 
them in a critical study of the structure or function of the 
thing itself. There is only a crude, personal interest mani- 
fested as the earliest type of interest which children have 
in the world about them. In the later grades evidence

University of Chicago. 
 
-P-A-G-E-330
  320 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
began to appear of interest in the structure of the animal 
and in its life history. This higher type of interest had 
been fostered in the school by nature study, so that even 
here it may be that the apparent interest of the children 
in structure and function was an expression rather of the 
results of instruction than of a natural and spontane- 
ous interest in these aspects of reality. At all events, 
whether induced by the classroom work or by the natural 
growth of the child’s experience, we have evidence here 
of a change from an earlier unscientific attitude to a later 
scientific attitude. 
In the second place, it became apparent that different 
classes of facts commanded the interest of children in dif- 
ferent degrees. It has usually been assumed in discussing 
children’s interest that they will early and spontaneously 
turn to the scientific study of animals. We all know that 
children are interested in animals, and the inference has 
often been uncritically drawn that all interest is scientific 
interest. It is only later, we are told in the older books on 
education and in the prefaces to nature-study books, that 
children can be interested in objects which are inanimate 
or do not move. Now it appears from the investigation 
that some children are very much interested in simple me- 
chanical phenomena. They comprehend such facts very 
much more readily than they comprehend the structure 
and function of animals. In this particular experiment 
one of the lower classes showed an overwhelming interest 
in the pendulum, and some of them preferred the plant to 
the animal. With these facts before us we must explain the 
universal interest of children in animals as unscientific. 
They are interested in animals because animals have so 
many characteristics which the child recognizes as personal 
characteristics. It is so easy to personify an animal that 
the child begins in the early stages of experience by feeling 
a very large sympathy for the animal, and just because of
-P-A-G-E-331
  
SCIENCE 821 
this close personal friendliness, he is far from desiring any 
structural or functional knowledge about it. If one points 
to the history of science, he can easily show that man 
studies last his own bodily structure and only in the latest 
stages of scientific development did he study animals. All 
of the biological sciences are very recent sciences so far as 
the race is concerned, and that for exactly the same reason 
that the scientific study of biological facts is very much 
more difficult for the child than the study of simple 
mechanical devices. 
Srupy oF THE RELATION or DRAWING TO SCIENCE 
INSTRUCTION 
A second investigation which has much to contribute to 
the psychology of science is one in which Mr. F. C. Ayer+ 
has studied the usefulness of drawing as a means of instruc- 
tion in science courses. It is commonly assumed that repre- 
sentative drawings ought to constitute a very large part of 
a course in science. Since laboratory notebooks came to be 
regarded as necessary, one finds a demand frequently reiter- 
ated that students make sketches in these books. The atten- 
tion of Mr. Ayer was drawn to this problem through two 
sets of considerations. In the first place, it did not appear 
on superficial examination of the standings of students that 
those who can draw best are the best students from the 
point of view of the teacher of science. In the second 
place, it was evident from the psychologist’s point of view 
that drawing calls for types of training and interest by no 
means identical with those required for science. Mr. Ayer 
was led, therefore, to make a more rigid comparison, and 
it appeared that his skepticism with regard to the relation

   322 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
between drawing and science was entirely justified. It 
appeared that there is very little correlation between the 
ability to draw and the standing of the student either in 
science or in his general courses. He found that the student 
may pay the strictest attention to the aspects of an object 
necessary for correct representative drawing without becom- 
ing conscious of the scientific import of the same details. 
Furthermore, it did not appear that improvement in science 
and improvement in drawing go hand in hand. The student 
who shows an increasing degree of efficiency in science may 
remain entirely static at a low level of ability to draw. 
Conversely, the person who improves in his ability to draw 
does not necessarily show any improvement in his science 
work. This negative result must, however, be paralleled by 
a positive statement regarding the relation between draw- 
ing and science work. Mr. Ayer was able to show on the 
positive side that the ability to make a sketch which points 
out in careful analytical detail those characteristics of an 
object which are of importance for the purposes of scientific 
explanation develops in parallel with the development of 
scientific thought itself. Thus, if we are studying the 
habits of a bird and it is desirable that we should know 
something about the type of food which the bird lives on, 
we may with propriety ask the student to make a drawing 
which will show the function of the bird’s beak. If we 
wish to find out in what kind of an environment the bird 
lives, it is desirable that the student should make such 
sketches of the bird’s feet and of its plumage as will show 
the relation of these structures to environment. Thus the 
study of drawing confirms the conclusion that it is very de- 
sirable that students should be able to analyze the objects 
whith they are studying. 
Analytical drawing as distinguished from mere making 
of pictures seems, therefore, to be the solution of our prob- 
lem. One may say that scientific analysis must always have
-P-A-G-E-333
  SCIENCE 323 
a definite motive. Attention on the part of a student can- 
not be too widely distributed over the object as a whole, 
if he is to be a good scientist. Furthermore, he must not 
be left to be guided merely by his accidental appreciation 
of this or that element of form. The student who is to use 
an object for scientific study must be guided by a definite 
principle of selection and analysis. He must look at the 
object with a view to finding out exactly how far the 
characteristics of this object are related to the one problem 
which he is at that moment trying to solve. Scientific draw- 
ing thus appears to be guided thought; science helps the 
student to distinguish from the mass of elements of experi- 
ence those elements which are significant from a particular 
point of view. In a certain sense of the word scientific 
thought is thus seen to be narrow and limited. One turns 
away from the general characteristics of the situation to the 
particular characteristics and is guided in this specialization 
by definite principles and interests. 
We have already seen that there are ample evidences for 
the statement that science is highly specialized. So also in 
this matter of scientific drawing or sketching we see that 
it is specialized sketching which is of value. Only after 
the student has worked out each of the details of an object 
from some particular scientific point of view can he come 
back to the more comprehensive and general problem of 
fitting these details together in one comprehensive study 
of the whole. A comprehensive study of the whole situa- 
tion or a synthetic study of the object is, therefore, one 
of the very late products of scientific thought. Analysis 
or specialization naturally precedes the later grasp of the 
object as a whole. The experiments reviewed in an earlier 
chapter, where an example was given of the development 
of an individual recognition of a figure, illustrate this 
principle very clearly.

ScIENCE MUST UNIFY EXPERIENCE 
The synthetic mental processes by which science attempts 
to build up in the minds of students a complete idea of the 
world are quite as important for psychology as the analytic 
processes which have just been discussed. 
Primitive Errorts At UNIFICATION 
Again an illustration from primitive science will help us. 
The Greeks saw a part of the relations of the earth to the 
sun; they observed the sun travel from day to day across 
the sky and they tried to formulate some idea of the way 
in which this could happen. To their minds the largest and 
most powerful instrument of movement was a horse and 
chariot. Consequently, they gave the sun in their thought 
all of the machinery of movement across the heavens that 
their imagination could devise, and the form of this imagined 
means of movement was a chariot with horses. We regard 
this idea of the Greeks as very crude. All of their stories 
about how the horses ran away, and about the coming of 
the sun down toward the earth and scorching the desert, 
seem to us to be very childish — because the imagery is 
wholly inadequate, and is so obviously inadequate that 
their satisfaction with it causes us no end of wonder at 
their simplicity of mind. 
In the same way we often find that the explanations of 
facts offered by children are picturesque, but ridiculous. 
What is inside of a mechanical toy, for example? Since 
the child does not know anything about mechanics, he is 
very likely to think that there is some person or some ani- 
mal inside. This simple explanation is merely the effort of 
the child to get an idea which will fill out his experience. 
He will be disappointed when he opens up the toy and finds 
nothing of the kind. Indeed, the astonishment with whic
-P-A-G-E-335
SCIENCE 825 
he will be filled when he comes in contact with the real facts 
of the case is comparable to the reluctance exhibited by the 
race to substitute mechanical forces for the agencies that 
they originally assumed for all sorts of natural phenomena. 
UNIFICATION THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF 
Systems or IDEAS 
In view of this difficulty of supplying children with ade- 
quate systems of ideas, we find much of our modern science 
instruction engrossed in the task of filling the minds of 
children with the right kind of supplementary ideas. One 
sees elaborate models of mechanical principles and of phys- 
iological organs. These models are constructed in the effort 
to give children proper systems of ideas. 
One of the best lessons that the writer ever heard in 
physics illustrates admirably what is needed in order to 
introduce elementary students to some adequate ‘notion of 
physical forces. The lesson in question was a lesson on the 
transmission of heat. The instructor began by furnishing 
the students with the imagery necessary to enable them to 
picture to themselves the molecules and their relations. He 
asked them if they had ever noticed the way in which bricks 
are carried in the construction of a building from the sup- 
ply to the point where they are to be used. By questioning 
the class he brought out the fact that there are at least two 
entirely different ways in which the bricks may thus be car- 
ried. In one case a line of workmen is formed and the 
bricks are passed directly from one to the other along the 
line. In the second case one workman takes a hodful of 
bricks and goes the whole distance. With this analogy in 
mind, he gave some simple demonstrations to show that in 
some cases the heat which is applied to substances, such as 
iron, is passed along rapidly from molecule to molecule. 
This is analogous to the action of the line of workmen who
-P-A-G-E-336
  826 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
pass the bricks from man to man. On the other hand, in 
the case of water there is no rapid transmission of heat from 
molecule to molecule, but heat must be carried by a change 
in the position of the heated water particles. He gave a 
demonstration to show that if water is heated, there is a ten- 
dency for its particles to take their load of heat and move 
to a new position. They do not, in this case, pass the heat 
to other molecules directly, but they keep the load of heat 
and. move about, thus giving the phenomena of convection. 
In general, molecular phenomena are much more abstract 
for students than are the mechanical phenomena treated in 
the first chapter of physics. Put into psychological terms, 
this statement means that students have great difficulty in 
forming coherent systems of ideas about molecules, while 
they can more readily think their way through the mechan- 
ical processes, which are more open to direct observation. 
The effect of this greater difficulty in understanding mo- 
lecular phenomena is that in American high schools very 
little attention is given to chemistry and to those forms of 
physical phenomena which are chiefly molecular. In Euro- 
pean schools, where one of the guiding motives for the in- 
troduction of science has been the practical application of 
these sciences to industry, more attention has been given 
to chemistry than in this country. Foreign visitors in our 
secondary schools are very much surprised to find that we 
do not have special courses that are centered around the 
chemistry of industry. The common practice here is un- 
doubtedly due to the psychological difficulty of teaching 
an abstract subject. 
FORMALISM ENCOURAGED BY ABSTRACT INSTRUCTION 
The abstract character of much science further results in 
the student’s giving up the effort to acquire a real system 
of ideas; he resorts to the easier method of learning the
-P-A-G-E-337
SCIENCE 827 
sentences given him in his text. The difficulty in such 
cases is that the student never gets an independent mastery 
of the methods of science, and merely follows the verbal 
formulas of some scientist who has turned observation into 
verbal description and verbal formulas. Words are not to 
be condemned as unscientific. Indeed, science could not 
develop without these essential aids to abstract thought. 
The trouble is that where finished verbal formulas are sub- 
stituted in the mind of a student for systems of ideas, 
science is subordinated to words rather than aided by them. 
The grave problem which confronts the science teacher is 
the problem of making sure that the student shall learn 
how to guide himself in critical thought even when he must 
deal with abstractions and words. 
CoURSES IN CONSTRUCTION NOT INHERENTLY 
ScreNTIFIC 
One of the suggestions which has been offered is that the 
student can be made scientific if he is confronted with con- 
structive problems. Let him feel the desire to do something, 
and he will learn to use his mind in satisfying his desire. 
He will be driven to thinking. Sometimes the explicit 
statement is made that scientific investigations grow, of 
necessity, out of practical situations. The introduction of 
practical arts is accordingly offered as the solution of the 
educational problem. Put a boy in the workshop at the task 
of making something, and he will discover that he needs to 
know how to use aruler. He needs to know, also, some- 
thing about the science of mechanics. Stimulated by these 
practical necessities, he will turn eagerly to the study of 
mathematics and physics. Enough has been shown in con- 
nection with the study of the history of the sciences to make 
it clear that this is an unfounded doctrine. Practical in- 
dustry does not automatically arouse the scientific attitude 
   
-P-A-G-E-338
  3828 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
as its natural consequence. Anyone who is confronted with 
the desire to make something is likely to resort to the 
crudest means if he is not trained beforehand to adopt more 
scientific methods. Instead of studying science and math- 
ematics, the boy who wants to make something usually 
patches together a very crude device, expending as little 
time and energy as possible on consideration. Furthermore, 
the ordinary attitude of mind is one in which desire for 
practical results often fails to arouse even the crudest 
activities. All of us would be very glad indeed to have 
devices around the house which would satisfy our needs, 
but we give up without even attempting to think of the 
ways in which these problems could be solved. In short, 
there are many needs which are really urgent but are 
entirely ignored by even the most practical men. 
PROBLEMS MUST BE INTELLECTUALLY APPREHENDED 
Perhaps one of the best illustrations of this fact is to 
be found in the unintelligent way in which many commu- 
nities ignore their really urgent needs for improvement 
of sanitary conditions. Savage tribes encountered a great 
many inconveniences and often diseases because of the 
lack of sanitary conditions in their villages. Modern cities 
in the tropics have frequently suffered seriously because of 
lack of appreciation of the needs of sanitation. Most children 
have a natural neglect of dirt that has to be eradicated 
by artificial training. In other words, the importance of 
keeping clean and the importance of sanitary measures have 
to be learned through a study of the situation. A community 
has to be persuaded that it has this sanitary problem before 
it will adopt measures to relieve itself of the inconveniences 
and dangers that come from ignoring its problem. 
Primitive man had need of mechanical devices, but he 
had not the remotest imagination of the possibilities of  
-P-A-G-E-339
SCIENCE 829 
machinery. Slowly he progressed by very short steps from 
the natural weapons which he picked from the ground to a 
modification of these, in the direction of greater usefulness 
and greater convenience. Slowly he learned, usually through 
social comparisons, that there are possibilities of securing 
better tools and better instruments of warfare. Still more 
slowly he learned that thought about the mechanical prin- 
ciples which he employs will facilitate the development of 
more elaborate and perfect tools. As the outcome of this 
very gradual development man is now keen about his needs 
and about the possibility of applying science to the solution 
of these needs; but the situation which has thus resulted 
from long experience can in no proper sense of the word be 
described as a natural or spontaneous interest in science. 
The problems which man has discovered are not natural 
problems which force their attention upon the ignorant or 
the inattentive. One must learn to see the problems about 
him. One must have a certain stock of problems and their 
solution in mind, as examples, before he will realize that the 
problem-seeking attitude is a productive attitude of mind. 
The ordinary member of society does not seek problems of 
social reform. He does not seek problems of personal im- 
provement. He does not seek problems in the world of vege- 
table and animal life about him. He simply goes through 
the world adjusting himself in a crude and inadequate way 
to the various experiences with which he comes in contact. 
ScIENCE DEVELOPS ONLY WHEN PROBLEMS ARE 
UNDERSTOOD 
The scientific specialist knows that there are problems in 
a certain sphere of reality, but he is not likely to be keen 
about problems in other directions. After one has examined 
minutely the structure of a certain set of animals or plants 
he sees familiar problems whenever he: encounters a related
-P-A-G-E-340
  330 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
plant or animal. The zodlogist and botanist, therefore, are 
always prepared to raise questions in the sphere in which 
they have had some experience. The man who is interested 
in politics or government sees the problems in that sphere 
of life, but he does not see the problems of the zodlogist or 
botanist. He cannot understand how anyone will devote to 
the structure of animals and plants the amount of time 
and enthusiasm that the zodlogist and botanist are ready to 
bestow upon the facts in which they are interested. The 
teacher sees problems related to school organization which 
the community cannot understand at all. The student of 
architecture sees problems in every house which he passes, 
while the ordinary observer fails utterly to realize what it 
is that absorbs the architect. 
In all these cases the first stage in cultivating the attitude 
of mind which is to be defined as scientific is that of discoy- 
ering problems rather than that of seeking solutions. In 
the same way, the business of the high-school course of 
science consists not merely in giving the solution of prob- 
lems; it consists rather in stimulating the student to see 
that there are problems to be solved. The difficulty with 
most of the science textbooks and with much of the labora- 
tory work is that the effort of the teacher is devoted to giy- 
ing the student results. Science in its completed form is a 
statement of solutions of problems. Science in the personal 
form in which the student needs to acquire it consists in 
the stating of problems in such a way as to give the student 
an appreciation of the reason why anybody should try to 
work at the subject. There is nothing more fatal to mental 
life than the learning of solutions of problems which are 
wholly artificial to the student and not appreciated by him 
as having any significance either for himself or for society. 
On the other hand, if one can get a student to see that the 
facts of life ought to arouse his curiosity, a very large part 
of the difficulty in science teaching disappears. 
 
-P-A-G-E-341
SCIENCE 331 
STRANGE FAcTS MAKE PROBLEMS EASY TO RECOGNIZE 
It is sometimes suggested that science ought to begin 
with the study of familiar facts. Psychologically it is very 
difficult to see a problem in a familiar fact. It was pointed 
out in connection with the study of the manual arts that an 
analysis of a familiar situation is difficult just because of its 
familiarity. The same general fact was referred to in con- 
nection with the discussion of language teaching. It is very 
difficult to get students to think about their mother tongue 
in any such way as to arouse an interest in the structure 
of the language. It is much simpler to get a person in- 
terested in a foreign language and to get him to discuss 
this language from the point of view of its structure and 
vocabulary. In short, it is the unfamiliar which presents 
obvious problems. One finds a concession to this natural 
psychological attitude in some of the supplementary read- 
ers on science which are put into the hands of students. 
Remote problems of a type which are utterly unfamiliar to 
the student’s ordinary experience are offered in these books 
as the most stimulating body of material with which to in- 
terest the student in scientific investigations. Strange plants 
and animals are described, and their modes of life pointed 
out, as the means of drawing the attention of the student 
to the fact that plants and animals have peculiarities which 
need to be studied. One can frequently interest a student 
in mechanical devices by referring to some new and elabo- 
rate and, on the whole, mysterious mechanical contrivance. 
“It has been found relatively easy, for example, to interest 
boys and older people in wireless telegraphy, because that 
is a new invention and difficult to explain and understand. 
One hardly feels the necessity of interesting himself par- 
ticularly in an ordinary telephone, because it is so familiar. 
An appeal to the relatively strange is undoubtedly legiti- 
mate as an introduction to science. 
 
-P-A-G-E-342
    3832 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
ULTIMATELY THE STUDENT MUST DISCOVER PROBLEMS 
in Fammiar Facts 
On the other hand, a continual diet of strange and won- 
derful things distorts the student’s attitude toward science 
in such an extreme way that there is danger of leaving in 
his mind the impression that all science deals with strange 
and remote objects. One of the criticisms of ordinary news- 
paper science is that it leaves in the popular mind the im- 
pression that science is full of extraordinary and mysterious 
problems and solutions. It would be very difficult to get 
any newspaper to publish some of the ordinary facts with 
regard to the atmosphere or with regard to the common 
principles of mechanics. There is no difficulty in getting a 
hearing for an account of some remarkable manifestation of 
atmospheric conditions or a description of a new and doubt- 
ful application of mechanics. Indeed, the more doubtful 
the veracity of the inventor in reporting his invention, the 
more likely is his story to get a hearing in the public mind. 
The teacher in the high school must, therefore, be on his 
guard not to stimulate the student with this foreign and 
strange material to such an extent that he will get the im- 
pression that science always relates to the remarkable and 
the remote. The student must be led to see that every 
object about him has characteristics which ought to arouse 
his inquiring mind to a scientific study. 
APPLICATIONS OF SCIENCE CONSTITUTE A SPECIAL 
PHASE oF STUDY 
It must be admitted that the ordinary textbook on science 
and the ordinary class instruction fail lamentably in apply- 
ing science and the scientific attitude to the ordinary facts 
of experience. It requires very skillful teaching to utilize 
physics for the ordinary facts of life. Although we are in
-P-A-G-E-343
  
SCIENCE 833 
the midst of mechanical appliances of all sorts we over- 
look them so readily that the ordinary student does not see 
physics as a practical science; he learns it rather as a body 
of remote and abstract principles. The abstractness of the 
material is greatly increased by the selection of experimental 
material which has to do with interests that are ordinarily 
very far from the student’s life. This is nowhere better illus- 
trated than in the physical experiments which are offered 
as a means of instruction to girls. It has been pointed out 
repeatedly that the ordinary examples used in a textbook 
in physics are drawn from the industries that are open to 
boys and men rather than from the domestic surroundings 
which are familiar to girls. The result is that the course of 
physics in the ordinary high school, if made elective, is usu- 
ally taken chiefly by the boys. The girls, trained through 
their elementary courses and through the ordinary influ- 
ences of the home to disregard mechanical devices as lying 
outside of the sphere of woman’s ordinary activities, look 
upon physics as a further expression of the male interest 
in mechanics and forget that all of the commonplace facts 
of ordinary life can be illuminated by a study of physical 
sciences. It would be very much better to begin a study 
of physics for girls by taking up some such problems as 
those of heat and color. To be sure, these are somewhat 
more abstract than are the laws of motion, but we shall 
ultimately recognize that the chief business of science, 
whatever its subject matter, is to train students to see prob- 
lems. When we have comprehended this general principle 
we shall undoubtedly find that many of the sciences will 
have to be recast. The final form which these sciences 
assume for pedagogical purposes will not be the form in 
which the sciences are most satisfactory to the mind of the 
trained scientist. We must find the means of arousing in 
students the problem-seeking and the problem-solving atti- 
tude. We cannot depend on ordinary life to cultivate either 
 
-P-A-G-E-344
  334 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
one of these attitudes. We must discover devices which 
will arouse the problem-seeking attitude, and we must then 
focus this attitude upon the commonplace surroundings 
of the students. 
TEXTBOOKS PRESENT RESULTS RATHER THAN 
PROBLEMS 
Illustrations of what has been said in the foregoing para- 
graphs can be taken from any one of the science books. 
Most science textbooks can be criticized by drawing atten- 
tion to the fact noted above that these books are chiefly 
concerned with the statements of results. Usually the most 
general results are put near the beginning of the textbook. 
A textbook in physics begins by telling about molecules 
and the constitution of matter or by giving some of the 
most compactly formulated statements about the principles 
of mechanics. From the point of view of the trained scien- 
tist this seems to be the surest way of introducing a termi- 
nology which shall be available for the statement of his 
science. His conception of the science is that it must fol- 
low the logical arrangement of the results of this science. 
Again, let us take a textbook in physical geography as 
an example. We find that such a book begins with a dis- 
cussion of the form of the earth. One of these texts begins 
as follows: “On September 6, 1522, a little company of 
weather-beaten sailors brought their vessel to rest in a 
Spanish port. Three years before, Magellan had led them 
forth, with a fleet of five ships, to find the Spice Islands 
by a western route,” and so on. We have a description of 
the fact that the earth can be circumnavigated. The next 
paragraph takes up latitude and longitude and discusses 
the earth from that point of view. The third paragraph 
deals with the earth within and without. This paragraph 
begins as follows: “No one knows much about the inside
-P-A-G-E-345
SCIENCE 335 
    
                                                              of our globe. Yet most of its bulk and weight are far 
within the surface, and geography, which looks at the earth 
as a whole, must take notice of it.” We then have some 
discussion of strata of rocks and of the internal structure 
of the earth’s crust. The fifth paragraph deals with land 
and water; the sixth deals with volcanoes; and so on. 
Doubtless the authors of such a book as this realized to 
the full the importance of getting before the student some 
general conception of what their science is about. The 
authors, knowing the importance of this general conception 
of the earth as a whole, began by trying to give the stu- 
dent the ripest and most complete product of all their sci- 
entific inquiry in the first few pages. The trouble is, the 
student who comes to this science sees absolutely no reason 
why one should be so absorbed in a study of the earth as a 
whole. The student very seldom has any real interest in 
the internal anatomy of the earth. He might wonder in a 
general way what is there, but he certainly is not prepared 
to exercise his mind very vigorously on this inquiry. The 
scientist who is enthusiastic about some discovery regard- 
ing volcanoes assumes that every student who hears about a 
volcano will instantly want to know exactly how the earth 
behaves at these points; but the fact is that the student 
is usually quite complacent, knowing that somewhere in 
the world a scientist will furnish him with the explanation 
of these facts if he needs it, and, furthermore, he feels 
that the probabilities are in favor of his never needing the 
information at all. 
The degree of enthusiasm of the ordinary student for 
these introductions which he gets in the textbooks is very 
slight indeed. Take textbooks on botany as another ex- 
ample. One well-known book on this subject opens with a 
paragraph on the inorganic world, contrasted in the next 
paragraph with the organic world. Then follow para- 
graphs on “the difference between plants and animals,”
-P-A-G-E-346
  336 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
a definition of botany, and a full description of the dif- 
ferent subdivisions of physiology. Chapter II opens with 
a paragraph on “the course of vegetation,” and so on. 
The student, confronted by these verbal additions to his 
experience, gets into the habit of thinking of science as 
verbal additions to experience, and he faithfully learns the 
words and keeps them in store against the time when the 
teacher demands them. 
ABSTRACT STATEMENTS OF RESULTS 
If it is objected that this kind of a text is antiquated, 
let us take one now in common use. In its “elementary ” 
edition it begins with protoplasm. It then tells the student 
about spirogyra, mucor, nitella, and the rest. The student 
is left to interest himself as best he can in these results 
of science. The instructor is at the end of the course in 
science; the student is at the beginning, and yet the order 
of presentation is that which is appropriate to the teacher’s 
mature knowledge rather than to the student’s immature 
state. Furthermore, these results of science come in the 
easy form of words. The student suddenly inherits a 
wealth of results without any effort on his own part be- 
yond that which is necessary to read words. The trouble 
is that he has no appreciation of all this that is lavished 
on him. Science, from society’s point of view, is a rich 
body of results. The scientific attitude which ought to be 
cultivated in the student is an inquiring attitude of mind 
full of problems, not solutions. 
Teachers wonder sometimes why students develop an in- 
terest in science so slowly. The lack of interest is hardly 
to be wondered at when one has canvassed a few of the 
textbooks and sees how the first chapters are always very 
general, dealing with the results of the science and giving 
none of the reasons why the science should be developed. 
 
-P-A-G-E-347
SCIENCE 337 
It would be difficult for the psychologist to improve 
upon the efforts of the science people themselves, and it 
would be presumptuous to make any recommendations if it 
were not for the obvious failure of the current science text- 
books to meet the needs of school courses. As has been 
pointed out time and time again, the present courses in 
science are under such constant criticism by the scientists 
themselves that any suggestion of relief will doubtless get 
a hearing if not a respectful acceptance. 
INSTRUCTION SHOULD PRESENT PROBLEMS 
Would it not be well to begin the discussion of a science 
in any one of the books by a concrete, particular problem 
as distinguished from the usual general results? Let us 
assume that the concrete, particular problem is approached 
at first in a wholly unscientific way. Let it be described from 
the historical point of view, explaining the interest which 
man has cultivated, or let it be approached from the point 
of view of its unusual characteristics. For example, in 
ordinary conversation the layman finds that the botanist 
has a body of information about the wheat plant which 
is so interesting that he wonders why this has not been 
put in the first chapter of some botany textbook. The 
answer of the scientist is, of course, that the wheat plant 
is by no means a suitable object for an introductory study. 
It does not exhibit the organs of a plant in that form which 
makes it easy to base upon it a later analysis of other plants 
and their organs. The attitude of the psychologist and the 
layman in science is that the textbooks which begin with 
the forms of plant life that are easy to expound do not 
seem to have succeeded, after many years, in arousing 
high-school students to a satisfactory pitch of enthusiasm 
for botany. Why not, for the sake of experiment, try some- 
thing new ? 
 
-P-A-G-E-348
  338 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
LABORATORY METHOD OF INSTRUCTION 
No study of science courses would be complete without 
full recognition of the enormous contribution which has 
been made to the intellectual life of students by the intro- 
duction of laboratory courses. Scarcely a generation has 
passed since laboratory exercises were first introduced into 
the high-school curriculum, and in this short period their 
usefulness as instruments of instruction has been so com- 
pletely demonstrated that any new method in the humanities 
as well as in the sciences needs only to call itself a labora- 
tory method to be sure of a respectful hearing. A well- 
organized laboratory exercise does for the student much 
that the general textbook, overfull of results, fails to do. 
The laboratory exercise confronts the student with a prob- 
lem; it leaves him to work out the solution; it gives him 
an opportunity to verify his judgments. It is concrete; it 
shows by many of its obvious, external characteristics its 
relation to ordinary life. 
How, then, can the laboratory method ever fail? The 
answer to this question is implied in the directions offered 
by one experienced teacher in his chapter on Instruction 
in the Laboratory.1 The directions much abbreviated are 
as follows: 
First, the object of the experiment must be definitely stated. 
... Second, the apparatus must be lucidly described. ... Third, 
a minute and practical description of the materials must be 
given.... Fourth, the handling of the material and apparatus 
must be made clear.... Fifth, the point at which a pertinent 
observation may be made should be indicated. ... Sixth, some 
indication is necessary as to what is to be observed. ... Finally, 
definite questions should be asked in regard to the interpreta- 
tion of what has been observed.

Secondary Schools, chap. iv. Longmans, Green, & Co., 1910.

SCIENCE 339 
PsycHoLoGy oF LABORATORY EXERCISES 
Put into psychological terms these directions mean some- 
thing like this: The laboratory situation is usually too 
complex for the immature student to master if left to his 
own devices. The experience of the race must be focused 
for him on this complex situation. He must be led by a 
short path to the productive conclusion which science has 
reached as its final result. Unless the guidance of the race 
is given to the student, he will wander and either come to 
the goal far too slowly or not at all. 
Laboratory exercises are among the most difficult prob- 
lems for the teacher to work out. The student must be 
guided enough, but not too much. The student must be 
called on to find out for himself, but he must not be left 
to become confused. The business of the teacher is to help 
the student reach a result, but at the same time to make 
sure that the student has used the right methods in reach- 
ing the result. The problem is therefore to find a proper 
balance between instruction and independence. 
Here, as in other school exercises which are properly 
organized, the contrast between an educational situation 
and a situation in the practical world can be described by 
saying that the school simplifies the situation for the time 
being in order that the student who is limited in his capa- 
bilities may cope with this simplified group of conditions. 
Little by little the school must lead the student forward 
through more and more complex situations until finally he 
is able to cope with the natural environment in all of ‘its 
complexity. The problem of the school is so to simplify the

making him unable or afraid to face complexities. The 
danger in these exercises is that they will become quite as 
formal and ineffective as the recitations which they were 
intended to supplement.

PEARSON ON ScrentIFIC METHOD 
There is one final matter to be discussed in this study 
of the psychology of science. It is the nature of that high- 
est product of scientific education, scientific method. Every 
teacher of science hopes to inculcate into his students re- 
spect for methods of exact, impersonal, and comprehensive 
thinking. These methods have often been declared to be 
the most significant contribution of our age to the history 
of civilization. 
What, then, is the nature of scientific method? An answer 
to this question may be sought first in a series of quotations 
from the writing of Karl Pearson.! 
The classification of facts and the formation of absolute 
judgments upon the basis of this classification — judgments 
independent of the idiosyncrasies of the individual mind — is 
peculiarly the scope and method of modern science. The scien- 
tific man has above all things to aim at self-elimination in his 
judgments, to provide an argument which is as true for each 
individual mind as for his own. The classification of facts, the 
recognition of their sequence and relative significance is the 
function of science, and the habit of forming a judgment upon 
these facts unbiased by personal feeling is characteristic of 
what we shall term the scientific frame of mind. (P. 7.) 
The insight into method and the habit of dispassionate in- 
vestigation which follow from acquaintance with the scientific 
classification of even some small range of natural facts, give 
the mind an invaluable power of dealing with many other classes 
of facts as the occasion arises. The patient and persistent study 
of some one branch of natural science is even at the present 
time within the reach of many. In some branches a few hours’ 
study a week, if carried on earnestly for two or three years, 
would be not only sufficient to give a thorough insight into 
scientific method, but would also enable the, student to become 
a careful observer and possibly an original investigator in his

chosen’ field, thus adding a new delight and a new enthusiasm 
to his life. The importance of a just appreciation of scientific 
method is so great, that I think the state may be reasonably 
called upon to place instruction in pure science within the 
reach of all its citizens. (P. 8.) 
SCIENCE DEPENDS ON IMAGINATION 
But, none the less, disciplined imagination has been at the 
bottom of all great scientific discoveries. All great scientists 
have, in a certain sense, been great artists; the man with no 
imagination may collect facts, but he cannot make great dis- 
coveries. If I were compelled to name the Englishmen who 
during our generation have had the widest imaginations and 
exercised them most beneficially, I think I should put the 
novelists and poets on one side and say Michael Faraday and 
Charles Darwin. Now it is very needful to understand the 
exact part imagination plays in pure science. We can, perhaps, 
best achieve this result by considering the following proposi- 
tion: Pure science has a further strong claim upon us on ac- 
count of the exercise it gives to the imaginative faculties and 
the gratification it provides for the zsthetic judgment. The 
exact meaning of the terms “scientific fact” and “scientific 
law” will be considered in later chapters, but for the present 
let us suppose an elaborate classification of such facts has been 
made, and their relationships and sequences carefully traced. 
What is the next stage in the process of scientific investiga- 
tion? Undoubtedly it is the use of the imagination. The 
discovery of some single statement, some brief formula from 
which the whole group of facts is seen to flow, is the work 
not of the mere cataloguer, but of the man endowed with 
creative imagination. The single statement, the brief formula, 
the words of which replace in our minds a wide range of 
relationships between isolated phenomena, is what we term a 
scientific daw. Such a law, relieving our memory from the 
burden of individual sequences, enables us, with the minimum 
of intellectual fatigue, to grasp a vast complexity of natural 
or social phenomena. The discovery of law is therefore the 
peculiar function of the creative imagination. (P. 37.) 
   
-P-A-G-E-352
  842 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
The scientific method is marked by the following features : 
(a) careful and accurate classification of facts and observation 
of their correlation and sequence; (4) the discovery of scientific 
laws by aid of the creative imagination; (¢) self-criticism and 
the final touchstone of equal validity for all normally constituted 
minds. (P. 45.) 
SCIENTIFIC LAW A PRODUCT OF INTELLIGENCE 
The other problem with which we are concerned is the 
existence or non-existence of a scientific law before it has 
been postulated. Here the reader will feel inclined to remark: 
“Admitted that ‘Nature’ is conditioned by man’s perceptive 
faculty, surely the sequences of man’s perceptions follow the 
same law whether man has formulated that law in words or 
not ? The law of gravitation ruled the motion of the planets 
ages before Newton was born.” Yes and no, reader; the an- 
swer must depend on how we define our terms. The sequences 
involved in man’s perception of the motion of the heavenly 
bodies were doubtless much the same to Ptolemy and Newton; 
to primitive man and to ourselves the motion of the sun is a 
common perception, but a sequence of sense-impressions is not 
in itself alaw. That planets move, that a chick takes its origin 
from the egg, may be sequences of sense-impressions, they may 
be' facts to be dealt with scientifically, but they are not laws 
in themselves, at least not in any useful interpretation of the 
word. The changes of the whole planetary system might be 
perceived, and even those perceptions translated into words 
with a fulness surpassing that of our most accurate modern 
observer, and yet neither the sequence of perceptions in itself 
nor the description involve the existence of any law. The se- 
quence of perceptions has to be compared with other sequences, 
classification and generalization have to follow; conceptions 
and ideas, pure products of the mind, must be formed, before 
a description can be given of a range of sequences which, by 
its conciseness and comprehensiveness, is worthy of the name 
of scientific law. 
Let it be noted that in this it is not only the process of 
reaching scientific law which is mental, but that the law
-P-A-G-E-353
SCIENCE 843 
itself when reached involves an association of natural facts or 
phenomena with mental conceptions, lying quite outside the 
particular field of those phenomena. Without the mental con- 
ceptions the law could not be, and it only comes into existence 
when these mental conceptions are first associated with the 
phenomena. The law of gravitation is not so much the dis- 
covery by Newton of a rule guiding the motion of the planets 
as his invention of a method of briefly describing the sequences 
of sense-impressions, which we term planetary motion. He 
did this in terms of a purely mental conception, namely, mutual 
acceleration. Newton first brought the idea of mutual acceler- 
ation of a certain type into association with a certain range of 
phenomena, and was thus enabled to state a formula, which, 
by what we may term mental shorthand, resumes a vast number 
of observed sequences. The statement of this formula was not 
so much the discovery as the creation of the law of gravitation. 
A natural law is thus seen to be a réswmé in mental shorthand, 
which replaces for us a lengthy description of the sequences 
among our sense-impressions. Law in the scientific sense is 
thus essentially a product of the human mind and has no 
meaning apart from man, It owes its existence to the creative 
power of his intellect. There is more meaning in the statement 
that man gives laws to Nature than in its converse that Nature 
gives laws to man. (P. 102.) 
The essential conclusion which can be drawn from the 
psychological analysis of these statements is that science 
is quite as much a product of human characteristics and 
capacities as of the characteristics of things. The human 
power of reducing all objects to namable classes through 
the use of language is as important in explaining scien- 
tific classification as is the existence of objects themselves. 
Animals have no science. Their minds in contact with im- 
pressions from the outer world react in a way wholly dif- 
ferent from that in which human beings react. Savages 
have a crude mythology, but no rigid scientific methods. 
They have no adequate scientific terminology. In short, 
their reactions are unscientific.

SCIENCE DEPENDS ON THE POWER OF GENERALIZATION 
To the student of educational problems these considera- 
tions are important because they make it clear that science 
is something more than mere reception of sense-impressions. 
Science is a system of thought. Science is a body of gen- 
eralizations. To construct this system of thought and these 
generalizations is a step in intellectual development be- 
yond the mere acquisition of the impressions out of which 
science may grow. 
We shall come back in a later chapter to the problem 
of the generalization of experience. This problem has come 
up several times before in our discussions. It is one of the 
major problems of education. Each subject in the curricu- 
lum seeks to develop the power of generalization in some 
way; and science, in making this its chief aim, is not de- 
parting in any measure from the traditions of the course of 
study as this course has always been organized by strong 
teachers, whatever the content with which they have worked.

CHAPTER XV 
THE FINE ARTS 
OPPOSITION BETWEEN THE FINE ARTS AND THE 
CONVENTIONAL COURSES 
The fine arts, like the manual and industrial arts, have 
stood apart from the conventional academic subjects and 
have been given only a half-hearted recognition in the 
organization of school programs. From one point of view 
this is difficult to understand, for civilized nations have 
always regarded training in music and drawing as highly 
desirable accomplishments. We in America have been sub- 
jected to criticism by foreign visitors and we have freely 
criticized ourselves for our meager cultivation of the fine 
arts in our schools. While thus recognizing the arts as de- 
sirable, we have found it a very difficult problem to make 
them available for school purposes. How can one formu- 
late a course in these subjects ? They seem to be highly in- 
dividualistic and vague in their results. There seems to be 
so large an element of chance in the outcome that we turn 
by preference to those courses of instruction which seem 
to be more definite and capable of impersonal formulation. 
The psychology of the fine arts helps to explain in a meas- 
ure this situation. The arts, like literary appreciation, de- 
pend in large measure on certain inner reactions which are’ 
obscure and often unrecognized by student and teacher. 
‘The external acts which are cultivated when one acquires 
some skill in one of the arts sink into insignificance as com- 
pared with the inner emotional processes involved in appre- 
ciation. These inner reactions are extraordinarily difficult 
345
-P-A-G-E-356
  346 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
to control and train. A part of the vagueness of the arts 
also grows out of a lack of analysis comparable to the 
lack of analysis which we found in studying manual habits. 
‘When one enjoys a painting it is very difficult for him to 
tell why he enjoys it. When one feels a thrill in response 
to music he does not make the kind of analysis that he 
does when he distinguishes the parts of a plant in botany — 
or the organs of an animal in physiology. The arts train 
in a type of analysis which we shall understand more fully 
as we proceed with the discussion ; but this analysis is dif- 
ferent in character from verbal analysis, and the school fa- 
miliar with scientific and verbal analysis has great difficulty 
in taking up the problem of art analysis.     
       
   
                    
    
       HistoricAL BEGINNINGS OF Music 
We shall gain a clearer view of the nature of art con- 
sciousness by studying briefly the evolution of one of the 
arts. The history of music furnishes material for such a 
study. One of the most primitive forms of music is that 
produced by the dancing warrior who beats his spear against 
his shield. A little higher in the evolution of the art the 
drummer sits apart and makes a rhythmical sound that 
guides the dances. The sounds in both these cases are not 
of interest because of their quality. In fact, the quality is of 
the crudest sort. The music is nothing but a crude series 
of noises reénforcing the bodily rhythms by giving to the 
nervous system shocks of stimulation which aid and inten- 
sify the rhythmical reactions. 
The work-song is another primitive type of music. A 
group of workers set up a rhythmical vocal accompaniment 
to their activities. The vocal reactions are not of significance 
because of their quality. Even when words are used these 
words have no significant ideas to convey to the singers, 
Anyone who has listened to a group of sailors drawing i

  THE FINE ARTS 347 
a rope and chanting a meaningless melody will realize at 
once that the purpose of the song is to secure social co- 
operation and to emphasize a rhythm of bodily activity 
which turns drudgery into a pleasurable succession of 
stimulations and reactions. 
The content of consciousness in both these cases is, of 
course, a matter on which one can offer only speculations. 
But if we may judge from the analogies of personal expe- 
rience, it is safe to say that there is not much analysis of 
experience. The sounds and bodily activities, the rhythm 
and the excitement, all fuse into a vague general mass of 
experience which submits itself only very little, if at all, to 
consideration or scientific dissection. 
Development does, however, gradually take place, show- 
ing that there is a tendency for attention to concentrate on 
the sound and for experience to become more complex in 
the rhythms which are evolved. The pleasure which comes 
with this enlargement of experience is greater than the 
primitive types of pleasure which came when the art was 
in its cruder beginnings. 
RHYTHM THE CHIEF SOURCE OF PLEASURE IN 
PRIMITIVE Music 
Let us consider first the increasing complexity of rhythms. 
Boas! has shown that primitive American tribes cultivate the 
ability to beat simultaneously two or three different rhythms 
with different parts of the body. These rhythms also exhibit 
internal complexities in that the accented movement is re- 
lated to a whole series of complex, unaccented beats.

1911.
-P-A-G-E-358
  3848 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
GrRowTH OF DISCRIMINATION OF TONES 
With the growth of complex rhythms there is a natural 
demand for differentiation of sounds. The accented sound 
differs from the unaccented in intensity. The contrast is 
made sharper if qualitative differences are also introduced. 
Thus, if the drummer has two drums or a series of sticks 
of different lengths and strikes these at intervals in the 
music, there will be a pleasing variety of pitch and inten- 
sity to accompany the complex rhythm. All this calls for 
increasing attention to the sound elements of experience, 
and the professional musicians of the tribe discovered the 
meaning and value of tonal differences as well as the pos- 
sibilities of more complex rhythms. The analysis of these 
professional musicians can hardly be assumed to be paral- 
leled by any like analysis on the part of auditors. The 
auditor receives a mass of experiences which he enjoys, and 
yet he never stops to analyze his pleasure. We discover 
even at this early stage, therefore, that reactions to music 
are highly individualistic and variable in character. 
ENJOYMENT DUE TO REACTIONS 
A consideration in some detail of the internal processes 
on which appreciation of rhythmical sounds depends makes 
it clear that we are here in the presence not of a purely 
sensory fact but of a complex form of behavior. There is 
a change in the rate of the heartbeat and of respiration. 
There is a change in the tension of the voluntary muscles. 
There is a succession of contractions and relaxations of the 
muscles of the hand and arm and trunk. Even the crudest 
sounds, if rhythmical, arouse in one the impulse to beat time. 
In short, there is a real physical play which responds to 
the stimulations of the music heard. If the vocal cords are 
excited so as to participate in the response, the pleasure of
-P-A-G-E-359
   THE FINE ARTS 349 
articulation may be added to the pleasure of other organic 
reactions. The conspicuous fact which is brought out by 
all these considerations is that enjoyment is a complex 
phenomenon depending in large measure on motor responses. 
Furthermore,: each individual responds with a series of 
movements peculiar to himself. His past development and 
present nervous and muscular development determine his 
inner reactions. This explains the individualistic character 
of art and also the fact that the essence of the art is in its 
appeal to the individual, not in its external content. 
Primitive music remains for a long period at this level 
where it is to be described as a mere accompaniment to 
bodily rhythms. The variety of tones necessary at this stage 
of evolution of the art is small. We find, accordingly, many 
musical scales which include only two or three tonal vari- 
ations. A common form of primitive music is that in which 
the voice or musical instrument oscillates between a note 
of low pitch and a note of high pitch, passing from one to 
the other and back again in a rhythmical succession of 
sounds and intensities. Sometimes this scale is elaborated 
into three variations of pitch, sometimes into five. 
ART ULTIMATELY BECOMES A STANDARDIZED SYSTEM 
Each of these changes in the scale marks an increase in 
the complexity of experience. The particular tones used 
by any particular tribe also come to be standardized. The 
result is that music rises to the level of a highly specialized 
system of tonal variations and combinations. Music as an 
art does not use all the variations of tone of which the 
voice is capable; it uses only a limited number of selected 
tones. Indeed, in early music the chant and the accompani- 
ment were different in tones, thus leading to the evolution 
of a specialized instrumental music. Furthermore, it is to 
be recognized here, as in all arts, that the experience of   
 
-P-A-G-E-360
850 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
the auditor or observer very often does not include as much 
attention to detailed differences as does the experience of 
the producer. The auditor is absorbed in the total unan- 
alyzed excitement of the situation. 
DEPENDENCE OF ART ON SUBJECTIVE MOTIVES 
At this point we may digress to call attention to the fact 
that music evolves from purely subjective motives. Art is 
never forced upon man by the external world. Man was 
compelled to learn the practical art of getting food and 
the practical art of building shelter because the stern 
necessities of existence in the world drove him to think 
of the things about him. He had to pick out the objects 
which he needed and think about them, and consequently 
his practical needs trained him in concentration of atten- 
tion on the particular things about him. But music has 
purely subjective value. Music appeals to the rhythms of 
the body and nervous system. Music does not move the 
world or provide shelter. Music develops only in response 
to the demand for subjective delight. We find, therefore, 
that musical systems, when once they are evolved, are 
extraordinarily conservative, depending absolutely on the 
development of modes of reaction in the individual. Primi- 
tive races adopt the clothes and the food of civilized man, 
but keep their own dances and their own music. Music is 
pleasurable because it sets up personal reactions and re- 
sponses. The more highly the art is elaborated, the more 
definitely personal responses will become fixed. Above all, 
music is not a practical system of behavior. 
Returning from this digression, we note that music as a 
system of sound relations developed in connection with the 
development of song on the one hand and with the growth 
of technical skill in instrumentation on the other hand. 
‘As:the chanting of the minstrel at the festival and later as
-P-A-G-E-361
  THE FINE ARTS 351 
the singing of the church choir developed, more complex 
systems of tonal combinations were worked out. Attention 
was centered in these later stages on sound, and the com- 
binations of sounds constituted a growing part of the 
art. The development of interest in sounds was also accom- 
panied by an evolution in the mechanical devices for the 
production of tones, though instrumentation has in many 
respects shown lines of development different from those 
which appear in vocal music. 
MELopY AND HARMONY RELATED TO REACTIONS 
The evolution of tonal discrimination and interest in 
tonal combination carries us far beyond the original stage 
’ of music, where the interest attached merely to noise and 
rhythm. As soon as men began to discriminate tones, they 
were led to work out certain regular sequences, or melodies. 
Later these melodies were made increasingly complex, until 
finally the higher forms of harmony were evolved. 
These later forms of experience seem at first observation 
to be sensory matters, and psychological discussions have 
usually proceeded on the theory that appreciation of mel- 
ody and harmony is a sensory fact. The physicists, concen- 
trating attention upon the stimulus which comes to the 
ear, are able to show that the number of vibrations in the 
successive tones included in an agreeable melody stand in 
a definite numerical ratio to each other. This fact has in 
turn been accounted for by certain physiologists as due to 
certain structures in the ear. The discussions which have 
been carried on in support of these sensory theories cannot 
appropriately be reviewed in detail here. We may remark 
in passing, however, that there has always been great diffi- 
culty in working out a satisfactory theory of the sensory 
elements involved in the creation of a scale and the devel- 
opment of melody.
-P-A-G-E-362
  852 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
It is legitimate to supplement these sensory theories by 
turning to the motor processes. A nation, long accustomed 
to a certain scale of sounds, cultivates both in singing and 
in emotional responses a definite set of reactions, which 
are aroused when one hears music or when one attempts 
to produce melodies or harmonies. These facts of response 
are quite as significant in explaining appreciation as are 
any facts of sensation. 
The case is immediately clear if we refer to the appre- 
ciation exhibited by a trained singer. Whether he listens 
or himself sings, his appreciation of tonal differences and 
of tonal conventions will depend upon the ability of his 
vocal cords to produce by a muscular readjustment the 
successive pitches of the melody. Where the adjustment 
of the vocal cords in attempting to pass from one tone to 
another is of an extremely difficult type, as for example 
when the tones are too nearly alike, the reaction will 
be difficult and disturbing. The flatting of a tone either 
when one is singing or listening is an extremely painful ex- 
perience for a trained singer, because he realizes, not only 
through his ear but also through his own motor adjust- 
ments, that the flatting of the tone is an improper adjust- 
ment of the sound-producing organs. When, on the other 
hand, the movements of the vocal cords are easy and agree- 
able, the total emotional experience is one of great pleasure. 
Added to these habits of the vocal cords, however, are 
the trained reactions of all the emotional reactions which 
come through long drill in a conventional series of pitches 
accepted in the national musical scale. A Chinaman evi- 
dently enjoys the monotonous succession of simple tonal 
variations which make up his national music. A European 
enjoys the simple Chinese music very little. He has been 
trained to a more elaborate series. In either case it is not 
alone the ear that has been trained. The whole organism 
responds to melody.
-P-A-G-E-363
   THE FINE ARTS 353 
This view finds new support in the fact that appreciation 
of harmony comes late in the evolution of music. Harmony 
consists in a group of agreeable simultaneous tones. The 
tones which are agreeable when heard simultaneously are 
for the most part those which are agreeable in a succession 
of tones. The development of a taste for harmony is a 
relatively recent fact and its psychological explanation is 
most intricate. One may discuss contrasts in tones and 
the fusion of tones; one must recognize that inharmonious 
tones produce beats and roughness which are added items 
of sensation, distracting from the pure tones and disturbing 
recognition ; but after attention has been given to all these 
sensory elements of harmony the fact remains that there 
is an inner emotional response to all harmony, and this 
response is not a sensory element. When one listens to a 
great orchestra his appreciation is determined not alone by 
the way the sound strikes the ear; it is the reverberation 
of the whole muscular organism that explains the enjoyment. 
APPRECIATION INCREASED THROUGH TRAINING 
In PRODUCTION 
Consider the child who is learning to sing or play the , 
piano. Observe how this child makes keener discrimina- 
tion after a little practice; note that he listens to melodies 
with new appreciation. In fact, the full appreciation of 
music cannot come without some skill in production. Some 
appreciation of music there is without a corresponding 
ability to produce, but the auditor’s appreciation is never 
so complete as that of the person trained in production. 
Even the appreciation exhibited by the mere auditor must 
be explained in motor terms. The relaxation which comes 
when one hears rich, soft tones, the tightening up of the 
muscles when one listens to martial music — these are typical 
facts on which to base an understanding of the appreciation.
-P-A-G-E-364
  354 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
When one has, in addition to the vague general organi 
reactions just mentioned, the finer discriminating reactions 
of the trained technician, appreciation will be of a higher 
and more complete type. Nearly every one can tell when 
a note is very flat, because every one has some skill in 
the vocal production of simple melodies; but it requires 
the trained singer to recognize a slight departure from the 
exact note. So it is with the more elaborate emotional 
responses to musical combinations. 
VARIETY IN ATTITUDES TOWARD Music 
The complexity of the educational problem becomes obvi- 
ous when we summarize what has been said about different 
classes of persons, all of whom are involved in this discus- 
sion. Consider in succession the composer of melodies, the 
ordinary producer, and the auditor who enjoys music but is 
not trained in production. The composer studies the laws 
of musical relations and the effects of various combinations 
of tones. His attention is alert for tonal differences and 
effects. The producer may be a pure technician, translat- 
ing visual symbols or memories into finger movement, or he 
may add varying degrees of discrimination. The listener 
may respond merely with vague general bodily reactions. 
The practical school problem is to train all students to 
some extent, and to discover the possible producers and 
composers soon enough to give them the more elaborate 
training which they need. 
Germany has a universal system of training. The pu- 
pils in German schools are taught to sing. The teachers 
of the Volksschule are trained to give instruction in music 
by courses in instrumental and vocal music. Every such 
teacher must sing and play either the violin or the organ. 
Appreciation is thus developed by a course of training in 
the production of music. 
 
-P-A-G-E-365
  
THE FINE ARTS 355 
In the schools of this country music is regarded as de- 
sirable enough to be made a part of the course; training 
in singing is the method most commonly adopted of culti- 
vating appreciation. Instrumental training is seldom taught. 
In a few instances the theory of harmony is taught even to 
secondary students. For the most part, however, training in 
music is regarded as a luxury, and failure to show efficiency 
in the music course is not treated as a serious deficiency. 
Especially has the cultivation of skill in playing a musi- 
cal instrument been looked on as of doubtful educational 
import. The experience of the world has shown that in 
some conspicuous cases the instrumentalist is devoid of 
intellectual power of the ordinary types; skepticism has 
therefore arisen as to the value of instrumental practice 
as a means of general training. This skepticism regarding 
instrumental music has reénforced the general attitude 
which arises from the fact that music is different from 
science and history and literature, and has made it more 
difficult for music to secure a place in the curriculum. 
PROBLEMS OF INSTRUCTION IN Music 
If one asks the music teacher what is cultivated in stu- 
dents by the course in music, the answer received is likely 
to be somewhat hazy. Some statement about the higher 
emotions, about cultivated feelings, is as far as one usually 
gets in these discussions. The psychologist has a right to 
ask that the emotion be defined more fully. Here we en- 
counter the real difficulty. The various individual modes 
of appreciating music are so different that the work is 
extraordinarily difficult to standardize. One person appre- 
ciates music because he has learned to play the violin, 
another because he has learned to sing, another because 
music sets his involuntary muscles in emotional action. 
Each person enjoys music, but each in his own way and in 
 
-P-A-G-E-366
  856 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
his own degree. Suppose the problem is put in such terms 
as these: “ Does it pay to take two hours a week to train 
students in singing?” There are two kinds of results from 
such training. The students will learn in some degree to 
sing. This result can be observed and tested. If the two 
hours a week have to be given for what is usually accom- 
plished in singing in a high-school class, the investment is 
probably too heavy. The music teacher will, however, 
usually emphasize a second and not easily measured result. 
The singing may be poor, he will tell you, but the cultiva- 
tion of taste is the real result. If now you ask for the 
evidence of cultivation of taste, it will be very difficult to 
supply objective evidence. This is the major reason why 
music and the other arts are looked on as doubtful members 
of the academic family. 
There is another phase of the situation which is not to be 
overlooked. The lack of analysis which is usually exhibited 
in the experience of a person who is absorbed in music is 
so opposed to all of the traditions of academic training that 
teachers are skeptical of the mental attitude which grows 
up through interest in music. To be absorbed in tonal 
combinations, to react with strong emotional reactions, may 
be personally satisfying and even elevating, but the scien- 
tifie, analytical mode of looking at the world is the end 
aimed at in most of the other classes in the school. The 
analytical attitude teachers understand, and they know 
that this is the sort of training of attention which lies 
back of many improvements in our modern civilization. 
Music, they hold, will have to prove its case, if it has a 
case, or it will have to remain an incidental feature of 
the curriculum. 
To introduce some history of music or some studies in 
harmony, in the hope of turning music into a subject like 
other subjects, is probably not the way to prove the case for 
music. To present general statements about the elevating
-P-A-G-E-367
  THE FINE ARTS 357 
effects of music is certainly not the way to prove the case 
for music. To give drill in production, together with train- 
ing in some of the canons of the art, and to concentrate 
attention on good examples of music so as to cultivate gen- 
uine appreciation are probably the most promising methods 
of procedure. In the meantime, someone interested ought 
to give to the students of education a statement of what 
musical taste really consists in, and he should evolve some 
method of evaluating the effects produced by instruction. 
GrRapHic ART AS AN INSTRUMENT OF INSTRUCTION 
What has been said with regard to music may be re- 
peated, with slight variations, for the graphic arts. If we 
study the history of graphic arts, we find again a rapid 
process of differentiation between the producer of pictures 
and the person who merely enjoys pictures. The producer 
of pictures, like the producer of music, has been regarded 
by society as a person whose skill is to be respected. Cer- 
tain aspects of the skill exhibited by the producer of draw- 
ings are recognized as of the highest intellectual type. The 
civilized world has commonly been prepared to reward its 
producers of art. On the other hand, the appreciation of a 
drawing is another matter. To give academic credit or any 
other form of credit for ability to enjoy a picture has not 
in general been regarded as legitimate. Furthermore, it has 
sometimes been doubted whether the school ought to try to 
cultivate in any general way the technical ability needed to 
produce drawings. It has been pointed out that some people 
apparently acquire this ability to produce drawings by some 
mysterious process of inheritance, or by a special devotion to 
one aspect of mental life to such an extent that they become 
narrow specialists, and defeat, through their devotion to 
graphic art, the ordinary ends of intellectual training. A 
person who is always trying to draw things may be very
-P-A-G-E-368
  858 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
negligent of his social relations and of his relation to the 
physical necessities of life. The artistic temperament, as it 
is sometimes described, is looked upon by the practical man, 
when it assumes its extreme form, as an unfortunate type 
of intellectual development, and one which hardly fits into 
the general scheme of society’s life and society’s training. 
There is, therefore, a great deal of confusion in the minds 
of school officers as to what they ought to do. 
TECHNICAL CHARACTER OF DRAWING 
Again the psychologist comes forward with the sugges- 
tion that a more careful study be made of the mental proc- 
esses aroused by the study and production of drawings. 
The historical materials are even more definite than those 
available in music. On the other hand, the reactions which 
arise in the individual are more heterogeneous than are the 
reactions which result from appreciation of music. Appre- 
ciation of pictures is connected in a measure with the ob- 
server’s development of space percepts. This involves, as 
indicated in an earlier chapter, some appreciation of mechan- 
ical balance. For these and like reasons we must relate 
graphic art to both the fine arts and practical behavior. 
Indeed, the pictorial arts are much more closely related to 
the industrial arts than music, for the simple reason that 
the pictorial arts have been obliged to employ external 
materials. There is no form of behavior which will produce 
a picture without the manipulation of external materials. 
In this respect drawing differs from music, since the un- 
aided voice will produce music. A picture is always depend- 
ent upon the relation between a tool of some kind and 
the substance on which the picture is drawn. To learn the 
relation between the tool and the surface on which the 
picture is to be produced involves, therefore, the acquisi- 
tion of a technical art. Furthermore, the subject of every
-P-A-G-E-369
  
THE FINE ARTS 359 
pictorial expression must be some external object. Conse- 
quently the artist is obliged in the drawing of his picture 
to pay some attention to the things which he intends to 
represent. There is in this necessity of paying attention to 
the external object an important characteristic of graphic art. 
Ear.ty DisREGARD OF PATTERN 
The extent to which the external object enters into 
drawings is a matter of great historical interest. We find, 
for example, that in earlier art the color of objects is a sub- 
ject of very little attention. Indeed, there was in the early 
days of painting so obvious a conflict between the observa- 
tions which were made on external objects and the mate- 
rials which were in the hands of the artist for expression, 
that it was only by neglecting the color of external objects 
that the artist could do anything. He had no means of 
expressing the observed colors of nature. The artist took 
advantage of the fact that the ordinary observer pays so 
little attention to color that it is usually quite impossible 
for him to give any account of the different shades of color 
exhibited by the object which he has in memory. Primitive 
painting was very like memory images in the fact that it 
did not imitate natural colors. What colors the artist had 
he used in expressing certain distinctions which were in his 
own mind. Color was of value, therefore, merely as a means 
of drawing attention to certain sharp contrasts. We find, 
accordingly, in primitive art a period of purely symbolical 
use of the color differences; and, furthermore, these colors 
were put into the pictures not in the relations in which 
colors appear in natural objects, where gradations of color 
and modulations of color tone are the rule, but in the 
earlier pictures there are great surfaces of the most striking 
colors, contrasted sharply, without gradations. 
 
-P-A-G-E-370
  
-860 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
DEFECTIVE PERSPECTIVE IN EARLY DRAWING 
Another conspicuous lack in primitive drawing is a lack 
of perspective. The early artists were again dominated in 
their productions not by a careful examination of the ob- 
jects which they represented but rather by their own mem- 
ory images. It makes no difference in the memory images 
whether an object is regarded as far away or near at hand. 
Its essential character is the same in either case. Indeed, 
the considerations which determine the size of objects in 
memory are wholly different from considerations of distance. 
It is the important objects which are likely to loom large. 
Important objects may be so large as to be altogether out 
of proportion in thought to the other objects, which consti- 
tute the background of consciousness. We see, therefore, 
in earlier art grotesque exhibitions of disregard for the true 
relations of perspective. In the foreground of the picture 
will appear a human figure of colossal size as compared with 
the landscape, which is put behind for the sake of artistic 
completeness. In like fashion, the impression which the 
earlier artist had of the interior of a room was very prim- 
itive indeed. Under the ordinary conditions of life one does 
not concentrate attention on the spatial characteristics of 
the room in which he lives. For example, one does not 
recognize the details of the lighting of the room until he has 
made a very careful study of it. Consequently the earlier 
artists were altogether unable to represent the interior of a 
room or to give the objects in the room anything like their 
real shading. 
This difficulty of representing perspective properly ap- 
pears very conspicuously in certain mistakes made both by 
children and by primitive artists. In drawing a human fig- 
ure in profile a child will represent more in this profile than 
he could actually see in an object observed from the side. 
He puts both eyes on the side of the face, or he represents
-P-A-G-E-371
THE FINE ARTS 361 
both arms on the side of the body which he is trying to 
draw. Primitive artists did exactly the same sort of thing. 
Furthermore, primitive artists and children draw the differ- 
ent parts of objects out of all proportion to each other. They 
draw the head of an animal altogether too large. This is 
due to the fact that the head is of much more significance 
to the observer than is any other part of the body. 
CoMPLEX PsYCHOLOGICAL CHARACTER OF GRAPHIC ART 
All of these facts with regard to primitive art and chil- 
dren’s drawing show that the graphic arts are a mixture of 
internal motives springing from the artist’s memory and 
from his personal attitudes toward objects and external 
motives borrowed more or less skillfully from the world 
of sensory experiences. For the most part, it may be said 
that attention to the external objects is relatively very late, 
and a careful analysis of external objects is the result of 
very elaborate study. 
This statement is seen to be the more significant when 
it is remembered that a large part of art is to be classified 
as design rather than as pictorial representation of objects. 
Design calls for the distribution of the drawing in a given 
space, and that space must, furthermore, have the different 
parts of the drawing so distributed as to satisfy the funda- 
mental demands for symmetry and balance. Much of the 
appreciation which we have for mural decoration is due 
not merely to the representations of external objects which 
appear on these surfaces, but to the way in which these 
representations are grouped so as to satisfy the observer 
with the space in which the drawing is placed. The lines 
of a mural painting must tend to support the architectural 
structure, and the emphasis which is given to different 
parts of space must have due regard to the building as 
well as to the thing depicted. Frequently the demands of 
 
-P-A-G-E-372
  
3862 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
design are such as to supersede altogether the interest in 
the representation. 
Where design flourishes, therefore, there is developed 
a kind of taste which is wholly different from that which 
attaches to the study of objects. For example, in dress 
designs and in decorative patterns on fabrics, taste de- 
pends on form relations, not on the desire to represent 
any real objects. 
All these facts complicate the issue for the school. Shall 
students be taught to draw? If so, what is the motive ? 
Study of form and color? Appreciation of symmetry and 
balance ? Careful observation of things or a study of the 
properties of expressive materials ? 
APPRECIATION MoRE COMPLICATED THAN PRODUCTION 
If there is difficulty in dealing with graphic art as a 
means of educating those who produce pictures, the diffi- 
culties multiply when we discuss the training of apprecia- 
tion apart from production. Let us consider a concrete case 
which shows how difficult is the training of appreciation. 
A painting which tells a story will usually excite infinitely 
more popular enthusiasm than a painting which shows the 
finest balance of form and color. The reason for this public 
enjoyment of the story-picture is that this picture arouses 
familiar, responsive emotional reactions. The painting shows 
someone in danger; the observer has all the contractions 
which would come from seeing real danger, with this one 
qualification, he knows that no harm is really coming to the 
subject represented. So he can enjoy the thrill of real dan- 
ger without having to pay the price of a real catastrophe. 
His experience is accordingly intense, while the cost is small. 
Yet pictured stories are not the highest art we are told. 
One ought to rise through training above the primitive en- 
joyment of a picture which merely tells a story to a correct
-P-A-G-E-373
  THE FINE ARTS 363 
appreciation of the highest art. This higher art is some- 
times called in question. One finds himself interposing the 
objection that art has often suffered in its extreme technical 
forms from temporary domination. by grotesque fashions. 
How is one to be sure that the refinements which his taste 
undergoes are really carrying him in the direction of the 
highest types of appreciation ? Perhaps he is taking on an 
artificial fad. The very fact that appreciation is a subjective 
matter, not checked by external conditions, leaves art at a 
disadvantage when contrasted with science. Science checks 
subjective reactions by constant references to the world 
of things. Art cannot check itself in this way. The fact 
that Western art exhibits fashions so radically different from 
those of the Orient, and the fact that occidental art shows 
so many divergent types in our own times, shows the diffi- 
culty of using art as an instrument of general education. 
COMPARATIVE VALUES OF DIFFERENT FORMS OF 
APPRECIATION 
It has been pointed out that literary appreciation is ac- 
cepted in the schools without serious dissent, and it is asked 
why art of other types should be less hospitably received. 
The answer is not far to seek. Language is a mode of ex- 
pression which all must cultivate for the purposes of prac- 
tical life, while the other modes of artistic expression are 
relatively nonessential. Since all must cultivate language, 
all will have some of the producer’s share of appreciation 
in artistic language forms. Furthermore, the canons of taste 
in language are constantly checked by the applications of 
language to the practical affairs of social and personal life. 
There is, accordingly, a stability in the language arts which 
does not appear in the other arts. 
The reader of the foregoing pages will doubtless interpret 
what has been said as unfavorable to the introduction of 
   
-P-A-G-E-374
  364 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
art into the high-school course. Such an interpretation is 
legitimate only in so far as difficulties frankly faced always 
seem to make the case unfavorable. The writer might free 
himself from the responsibility of uttering criticism against 
art by hiding behind the actual present-day verdict of the 
schools. If he has implied criticism of art, the school openly 
classifies art as of doubtful value in the course of study. 
It is no part of the writer’s purpose to escape responsibility 
by appealing to present practices and present prejudices. 
He much prefers to let the statements stand as valid quite 
apart from any of the present attitudes of those who make 
school programs. The interpretation which he would put 
upon the facts discussed is this: If the arts are to find a 
place in the school program, they must first find an adequate 
and definable method of instruction. Experience seems to 
point in the direction of an emphasis on production as the 
best method of training. Whatever the method of instruc- 
tion, art teachers must give up the practice of indulging 
in rhapsodies over art and its value, and must learn to de- 
fine the types of appreciation which they wish to cultivate. 
They must show that they know when they have produced 
one of these approved types of appreciation. Finally, they 
must by practical demonstration convince the world that 
there is no fundamental opposition between the habits of 
mind and action cultivated in the arts and those cultivated 
in the scientific courses given in the schools. The present- 
day conditions are a challenge to art teachers and to all of 
us. Vaguely we all believe in art; practically we are not 
able to bring it into the schools in any form which we re- 
gard as satisfactory for the training of students. To bring 
it forcibly into the course without heeding the objections 
raised will be unfortunate. To omit it altogether is to 
deprive the student of one important aspect of civilization. 
The challenge to deal with this situation intelligently is 
peremptory.

Tue Present Status or Music in AMERICAN 
HicH ScHooLs 
Since the foregoing statement has given relatively little 
account of the practices of high schools in the matter of art 
instruction, we may, before closing the chapter, make some 
reference to the reports which show the conditions of these 
lines of work in schools. 
Statements with regard to music may be taken from a 
bulletin issued by the Bureau of Education.! The following 
quotations taken from different parts of the monograph set 
forth the situation in detail. 
Musicians are not fully agreed among themselves as to what 
constitutes music education. The definition still varies accord- 
ing to the standpoint of the definer. The composer, the per- 
former, the theorist, the pedagogue, will each interpret it in the 
light of his own specialty. It is this lack of system, this indefi- 
niteness of aim, that have repelled those who mold educational 
opinion, and have caused them to withhold from music that edu- 
cational value which its votarists claim for it but which has been 
obscured by the desultory nature of music instruction. (P. 7.) 
A statement of the work in secondary schools would be a 
recapitulation of what has already been said [regarding courses 
in colleges and special schools of music] with the addition that 
the standards of excellence and efficiency do not as a rule com- 
pare favorably with those in the institutions of higher educa- 
tion. Of the two hundred and twenty-eight schools reported 
forty-six per cent employ one or two instructors whose entire 
time is given to the institution and whose duties are to give in- 
struction in piano, singing, organ, violin, and theory. There are 
schools among the number reported which have well-organized 
departments and well-conceived courses of study. In some, 
mention is made of the advantages accruing from the study of 
music in connection with subjects in the literary departments,

No. 4 of the United States Bureau of Education, 1908. Whole number,

-P-A-G-E-376
  366 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
and in a few instances, the completion of a high-school course 
of at least three years is required before graduation in music. 
Attention here, as in many institutions of the other classes, 
is directed mainly to performance, with some emphasis upon 
theoretical subjects. (P. 19.) 
Perhaps no single disclosure by the investigation is more 
encouraging than this. While the advancement of students 
still rests in many cases with the instructor, or with the in- 
structor and director of the department jointly, the develop- 
ment of a system of accurate grade marks, based on examination 
and recitation, gives promise of the eventual setting up of such 
standards as will result in the unifying of educational effort. 
(P. 41.) 
There appears to be a growing purpose upon the part of the 
departments of music in colleges and universities to demand a 
certain amount of general educational qualifications from those 
who wish to enter graduate courses in music. (P. 42.) 
Perhaps the most significant fact which an investigation of 
present tendencies shows is the marked change in their attitude 
toward music of the dominating forces in educational move- 
ments to-day, namely, the colleges and universities. While music 
is still made to feel that it is only tolerated in some institutions, 
there has come to pass what might rightfully be esteemed a 
remarkable change of heart upon the part of the institutions 
of the highest grade and influence. It is clear that the separa- 
tion between music and general educational thought is not only 
being rapidly lessened but that it will completely disappear in 
a much shorter time than past conditions would warrant one 
in predicting. (P. 81.) 
Secondary schools, which in general education take care to 
have their courses closely articulated with those of institutions 
of higher education, attempt the same grade of music instruc- 
tion as the best equipped conservatory or college. There are 
no secondary music schools. A well-detined, properly regulated 
development of music education from its most elementary to 
its highest grades does not yet exist. (P. 83.)

CARTER ON GRAPHIC ARTS IN AMERICAN 
HicH ScHoois 
A review of the place of graphic arts in secondary schools 
in the United States is included in the general volume pre- 
pared under the auspices of the American Committee of the 
Third International Congress for the Development of Draw- 
ing and Art Teaching held in London in 1908.1 
In his review, Mr. Carter gives various statements made 
by heads of departments in high schools regarding the pur- 
pose of art in the secondary-school course. In summing up 
these various statements Mr. Carter writes as follows: 
Increasing importance seems to be given to the dissemination 
of art ideas. Weare recognizing more and more that familiarity 
with these ideas is fully as important as technical skill in draw- 
ing and painting. It is also to be noted that the tendency is 
increasing to connect designing with work in material. (P. 206.) 
Most of the teachers have had special training. Occasionally 
they have studied at home and abroad with the aim of becom- 
ing artists, and have afterwards taken up teaching. As a gen- 
eral thing they are allowed considerable liberty as to what they 
teach and as to how they present it. As a consequence courses 
of study present considerable variety. (P. 209.) 
A PsYCHOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION 
In the field of graphic art many studies have been made 
of children’s drawing, but these relate, for the most part, 
to an earlier period than that in which we are interested in 
dealing with the high school. One volume, however, which 
may be referred to as a strictly psychological discussion is 
De Boisbaudran’s monograph entitled, “ The Training of 
1 Charles M. Carter, ‘tArt Education in the High Schools,” in Art Edu- 
cation in the Public Schools of the United States (edited by J. P. Haney), 
pp-201-242. Published by the American Annual, New York, 1908. 
 
-P-A-G-E-378
  368 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
the Memory in Art.”! In this monograph the author gives 
an account of his method of training students to remember 
form and color. The whole discussion is very interesting 
to the psychologist in its emphasis upon the analyses which 
are to be made of objects, in order that the student may be 
keen in his memory of their outlines and colors. The volume 
is a very forcible argument for the kind of analysis described 
in the paragraphs in the foregoing chapter on the place of 
drawing in science instruction. 
Dow on THE TEACHING OF ART 
In support of some of the comments which have been 
made regarding the difficulty of defining the exact purpose 
and character of art instruction it may be proper to quote 
at length the hopeful but vague statements of one of the 
leading teachers of the graphic arts.? 
A training that calls for a very direct exercise of the critical 
powers, developing judgment and skill, is a training that will 
increase the individual’s efficiency whatever his calling may be 
The general public has not thought of art education in this 
way, but has acknowledged the value of “drawing,” especially 
when it can serve some utilitarian purpose. 
A better understanding of the true usefulness of art recog- 
nizes creative power as a divine gift, the natural endowment 
of every human soul, showing itself at first in the form that 
we call appreciation. This appreciation leads a certain number 
to produce actual works of art, greater or lesser, — perhaps a 
temple, perhaps only a cup, — but it leads the majority to desire 
finer form and more harmony of tone and color in surroundings 
and things for daily use. It is the individual’s right to have 
full control of these powers.

   THE FINE ARTS 369 
Even from the economic side, that education is deficient 
which leaves one unable to judge of form and color when he 
is constantly required to use such judgment. This lack of 
appreciation is responsible for an immense waste of labor, skill, 
and money in the production of useless and ugly things. Works 
of fine art stand among the things which the world prizes most 
highly. A nation’s ideals are revealed in its art, and its art 
has greatest value when it is the expression of the spirit of 
the whole people. 
In a sympathetic public is found the life-giving influence 
which creates works of fine art, and the measure of their ex- 
cellence is the measure of the nation’s appreciation. 
The attainment of such an end as this places public art 
education above a mere training in drawing, painting or model- 
ing, and above the so-called practical applications. The work 
must be organized for a steady growth in good judgment as to 
form, tone, and color, through all grades from the kindergarten 
to the university. The main question at all stages is whether 
the art work of the school is making this good red blood of 
appreciation and giving to the individual the greatest possi- 
ble encouragement to express himself.

CHAPTER XVI 
HISTORY 
THE Rapip INcREASE oF History CourRsES 
History courses have grown very rapidly in recent years, 
both in the number of courses offered and in student regis- 
tration. While the courses in science have grown relatively 
less popular, and while the subjects which were formerly 
required of every student, such as mathematics and classics, 
have been falling off, history has steadily gained. There is 
evidently a general belief on the part of school authorities 
and students alike that history serves, in a very important 
way, the interests of broad, general education. 
During the period of rapid growth of historical subjects 
there have arisen many questions both as to the subject 
matter and methods. The reports of successive committees 
of the American Historical Association, and of certain local 
associations which have interested themselves in the organi- 
zation of a secondary course, all make it clear that a defini- 
tion of history is more difficult than a definition of almost 
any other subject in the curriculum. The types of judgment 
which history is supposed to cultivate in the student and 
the wide range of facts which are given to him in the history 
courses distinguish this subject from the other subjects of 
the curriculum. The only other subject which approaches 
history in the complexity and range of material is English, 
and, as we have seen in an earlier discussion, it is extremely 
difficult to organize the English courses satisfactorily just 
because of the variety of ends which different teachers seek 
to attain through them.

-P-A-G-E-381
HISTORY 371 
ADMINISTRATIVE COMPLICATION IN ORGANIZING 
History 
One becomes clearly conscious of the difficulty of defin- 
ing history if he examines the various suggestions which 
have been made about sequences of courses, and even more 
if he examines the actual practices in schools. The actual 
practices depart from the ideal courses which are laid down 
by committees of historians, because students do not take 
the full series of electives that are regarded as necessary by 
the authors of these plans for a complete course in history. 
The ideal course is sometimes based upon a chronological 
sequence. Ancient history is to be followed by medieval 
and modern European history. These, in turn, are to be 
followed by the special study of English history and by a 
final course in American history. This full chronological 
plan, however, is not organized so that all of its parts can be 
taken by each student. The student in the classical course 
is sure to be required to take ancient history. Whether he 
takes any other history or not depends entirely upon the 
opportunities which the elective course may offer him and 
upon his ability to take advantage of these opportunities 
at the same time that he is fulfilling the requirements of 
the college which he expects to attend. We have in many 
cases, accordingly, the spectacle of a classical student thor- 
oughly trained in ancient history but relatively ignorant of 
any of the modern periods. On the other hand, the student 
who takes one of the modern-language courses, or who takes 
a scientific course, very frequently is content to elect only 
a single modern-history course out of the chronological 
sequence. In some states the single course which such a 
student takes is determined by law. A course in American 
history is required of every graduate of the high school; 
and this is the only course in history which many students 
are able to include in their programs.   
-P-A-G-E-382
    
372 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
Here again a complication grows out of the fact that 
American history is one of the favorite subjects of instruc- 
tion in the upper grades of the elementary school. It is 
not regarded as advisable, therefore, to include it in the 
program of the earlier years of the high-school course. The 
student takes American history in such cases near the end 
of his high-school course, but without any background of 
European history or any knowledge of the English ante- 
cedents of American civilization. 
THE VARIETY OF PURPOSES AIMED AT BY HISTORY 
CouURSES 
Not only is the history course thus broken up by the 
miscellaneous choices made by students, but the courses 
themselves seldom show any clear definition of purpose or 
progression of method. In writing for Monroe’s “ Cyclo- 
pedia of Education ” 1 Professor Haskins defines the proper 
sequence of historical courses as follows: 
In the earlier stages of historical instruction, attention is 
given particularly to the teaching of a few simple facts and 
the development of the historical imagination; in the higher 
stages the number of facts increases and more emphasis is put 
upon their relations and political and social significance, and 
upon the acquisition of a critical and impartial habit of mind; 
while in the most advanced grades of instruction the student 
learns to find, test, and combine his facts for himself until he 
is able to undertake independent research. 
THE DIFFICULTY OF ORGANIZING COHERENT COURSES 
This definition of the proper sequence of historical 
methods and material is, however, seldom realized in the 
actual practices of high schools. Indeed, it may be doubted 
1 Vol. III, p. 284. The Macmillan Company, 1912.
-P-A-G-E-383
  HISTORY 3873 
whether even in college departments of history a definite 
sequence of this sort is ever followed. It is not an un- 
familiar experience of the student to find that the course 
in history which he pursues in his senior year is no more 
advanced in character than the course which he takes in 
his freshman year. The subject matter has, indeed, changed 
somewhat; it may in some cases be more detailed in the 
later course than in the early course; but there is no obvi- 
ous progress from year to year in the intellectual require- 
ments which are made in the successive history courses. 
In this respect history is in sharp contrast with many of 
the other subjects in the curriculum. The course in Latin 
or the course in mathematics carries the student forward 
to more and more complicated mental operations with each 
change in the subject matter. Science, as we have pointed 
out, does not show us clearly this progressive demand upon 
the student in successive courses. That is a symptom of 
immaturity in science teaching as well as in the organiza- 
tion of the history courses. 
The lack of sequence grows in part out of the fact 
that any course in history may make, and does make, a 
very large demand upon the general powers of the stu- 
dent. Even if a student is studying the relatively simple 
material of biography, he has an opportunity to judge of 
all sorts of human relations in a complex fashion which 
makes the subject of history from the outset very broad 
in its character and in the types of mental activity which 
it should include. 
HART ON THE PuRPOSE OF History CouURSES 
It is not difficult to find evidence that historians them- 
selves recognize the complexity of history. A number of 
quotations may be given to show the extent to which they 
have pointed out this complexity of their subject. In the 
 
-P-A-G-E-384
  374 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
following statement Professor Hart! indicates a number of 
different intellectual methods of procedure which a good 
history course ought to include. Especial emphasis should 
be laid upon the latter part of Professor Hart’s statement, 
where he demands more than mere accumulation of facts. 
Let us now pass to the everyday.work of the classroom. In 
all historical teaching the first principle to fix in the mind of 
pupil and teacher is the importance of accurately established 
facts, and the second principle is the worthlessness of detached 
facts. From the beginning, it should be understood that a knowl- 
edge of facts is not a knowledge of history; that the textbook 
simply selects and groups a very small number of facts, and 
that the essential thing is to know how facts are related and 
what they mean when viewed together. There are, therefore, 
four correlated aims which the teacher must keep constantly in 
mind. He must teach facts; and for that purpose the textbook 
and recitation system is best adapted. He must show the rela- 
tions between facts; and lectures and talks will bring out those 
relations. He must accustom the pupil to assemble facts for 
himself and to test them; the topical method affords the nec- 
essary training. He must lead the pupil to think and judge a 
little for himself; the preparation of topics and outside read- 
ing will induce some degree of independent thought. 
THE COMMITTEE OF FIVE ON THE PURPOSE OF 
History CouRSES 
The Committee of Five, which has recently reviewed 
the work of earlier committees and expressed a very ma- 
ture judgment upon the proper character of historical work 
in the secondary schools, describes the course in history in 
the following terms, making clear its general position that 
the scope of such a course is very broad.”

emy for September and October, 1887, p. 14.

  HISTORY 375 
But if history is to be a study of actual educational value, 
and culture, if the boy and girl are to be given insight into 
social life, some real sense of time and movement, and, above 
all, interest, vital interest, in books and facts, the teacher must 
have character, enthusiasm, and knowledge. Because we believe 
so profoundly in the helpfulness of historical study, the neces- 
sity of bringing the pupils to see the world about them as the 
product of past ages, the value of learning to handle books and 
to think and speak clearly, — not alone of quantities in algebra 
or of facts in physics, but of human doings,— we wish here 
distinctly to state our belief that all questions of curriculum 
are comparatively insignificant. The schools have a right to 
demand teachers that are prepared to teach history and have 
the ability and the spirit to teach it right. Public schools, sup- 
ported by taxation, that are content with the old idea that any- 
body can teach history, that anybody can trace the line of life 
through the past and give his pupils the spark of interest and 
the fire of useful knowledge, have, in our opinion, a distorted 
conception of their responsibility. The great demand of the 
day is for teachers that have themselves inhaled the breath of 
enthusiasm, and that have knowledge, skill and force. 
SEELEY ON THE COMPLEXITY OF HisToRY 
Contrasting the history course in its methods and com- 
plexity with the science courses, Professor Seeley has made 
the following statement: ! 
In short, science brings together phenomena of the same 
kind, but history brings together phenomena of different kinds, 
which have chanced to appear at the same time. We have given 
to history the conscientiousness of science, but we have not yet 
given it the arrangement of science. We still arrange historic 
phenomena under periods, centuries, reigns, dynasties, but what 
is wanted is a real rather than a temporal classification. The 
phenomena should be classed under such headings as Constitu- 
tional, International, Economical, Industrial, etc. Nor should

  376° PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
each state be studied by itself, but all states together, the com- 
parative method being constantly employed, and much atten- 
tion being given to the classification of states. 
It will be seen that this principle would be almost revolu- 
tionary if it were at once, and without reserve, applied to the 
teaching of history. Iam sensible that it needs to be explained 
at great length, and I am quite aware how many objections 
might be urged against it. But I have not time either for fuller 
exposition or for dealing with objections, and therefore in the re- 
mainder of this paper I shall deal with an intermediate system 
which might, without too great difficulty, be adopted at once. 
The essential point is this, that we should recognize that to 
study history is to study not merely a narrative, but at the 
same time certain theoretical subjects. Thus, industrial facts 
cannot be understood without political economy, nor military 
facts without military science, nor legal facts without legal 
science, nor constitutional and legislative developments with- 
out political science. I have gone further, and laid it down 
that these theoretical subjects are the real object for which his- 
torical facts are collected and authenticated. But for the pres- 
ent it is enough that they should be recognized as inseparably 
connected with historical study. It has always been tacitly 
assumed that the historian is also an economist, an authority 
on constitutional law, on legislation, on finance, on strategy. 
Let us, then, go a single step further, and recognize that, as the 
historian is all this, the student of history must prepare him- 
self to be all this — in other words, must master all these sub- 
jects. These are the great subjects of public life; these are the 
studies which make the citizen and train the statesman. All 
the poetic charm which history is losing would be amply com- 
pensated if it should acquire in exchange the practical interest 
that is associated with these studies. 
NATIONALISM AS AN END oF History TEACHING 
Furthermore, it is possible to show that history teachers 
are not entirely clear as to the functions of their subject by 
reviewing a discussion which has, of late, attracted a good
-P-A-G-E-387
  HISTORY 37T 
deal of attention. The earlier teachers of history never ques- 
tioned at all the statement that the course in history was in- 
tended to develop a spirit of intense nationalism. The courses 
in European schools have long served explicitly this purpose 
of training the youths of each country in intense devotion 
to the interests of that country. When history began to 
find its place in the American course of study, it was 
natural that it should be assumed that one of the main 
purposes of the course is to cultivate a national spirit. 
History was thus made to serve a very genuine social end 
in the course of study. 
Of late, however, the students of history have been call- 
ing attention to the fact that it is extremely difficult to pass 
judgments upon the acts of nations and individuals on the 
basis of the relatively meager knowledge which any student 
of history, especially an elementary student, can acquire. 
This whole discussion is made very clear in two quotations 
which may here be inserted. 
The study of United States history should infuse into the 
minds of American youths the American spirit, a benevolent 
disposition toward all classes of American citizens, a profound 
regard for all sections of the country, an admiration for free 
institutions, a willing obedience to the constitution and laws, 
and a deep and abiding love for the Union.+ 
On the other hand, the Committee of Seven? takes a 
position exactly opposed to that taken by Allen. This com- 
mittee expresses itself very pointedly on the matter. 
The corresponding noteworthy fact is that, if a definite 
reason for the study of history is presented, it is the factitious 
one of patriotism. The idea that the chief object in teaching 
history is to teach patriotism is so thoroughly ingrained, not

tom, Wetmore & Company.

-P-A-G-E-388
  378 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
only in America but in other countries, that it is extremely 
difficult to combat it. Yet it must be evident that the patriot- 
ism thus advocated is more or less a spurious one, a patriotism 
that would seek to present distorted ideas of the past with the 
idea of glorifying one country at the possible expense of truth. 
If the facts of the Franco-Prussian War should be used both in 
France and in Germany to inculcate this kind of patriotism, 
diametrically oppasite results would be reached; if the Amer- 
ican Revolution is to teach this patriotism both in England and 
in America, one nation or the other must be illogical; if the 
Northern and the Southern states of America should use the 
facts of the Civil War to promote either a national or a sec- 
tional patriotism of this character, those facts would have to 
be perverted. That the ultimate object of history, as of all 
sciences, is the search for truth, and that that search entails 
the responsibility of abiding by the results when found, is yet 
to be learned by many of our teachers of history. 
The present condition of instruction in history in the schools 
is open to criticism for another reason. The curriculum has in 
many cases not been the result of educational experience or a 
product of educational theory. This fact explains in large meas- 
ure the prevailing desire to use history as a vehicle for teach- 
ing patriotism. It probably does not admit of question that the 
curriculum of the public schools must and should be enacted by 
the state legislatures, but it is equally true that behind these 
legislatures should be organized bodies of competent advisers 
to whose decisions on educational matters the state legislatures 
should give the weight of their authority rather than them- 
selves assume the initiative. 
IntRIcAcy or MorAL JUDGMENTS 
If we attempt to reduce this discussion to its psycho- 
logical terms, we may make some such statement as the 
following: No person is in a position to pass judgment 
upon the moral character of any act unless he understands 
thoroughly all of the conditions which surround the act. 
In order to understand historical relations fully one needs
-P-A-G-E-389
HISTORY 379 
to have such a view of the historical situation as it is 
extremely difficult for a modern student to acquire. The 
modern student is, in the first place, guided in all of his 
judgments by an established mode of thought which is 
peculiar to his own generation. We have certain notions in 
this day about the treatment of colonies, for example, that 
are wholly different from the notions that obtained at the 
time that England was in controversy with her American 
colonies. The notions that we now entertain are the results 
of long historical periods which have recorded themselves 
in the literature and language of our people. The youth of 
to-day is introduced directly to these political and ethical 
ideas without any special reference to the earlier controver- 
sies out of which the present notions have grown. When, 
therefore, he is suddenly carried back in his historical stud- 
ies to situations that differ altogether from the situations 
that now confront him, he is likely to carry back, without 
being fully aware of the fallacy of his procedure, those 
standards of judgment and canons of ethical thought which 
constitute his present inheritance. He judges, in other 
words, by modern standards, situations which are in char- 
acter wholly different from those of to-day. 
Memory AND HistorIcAL MATERIALS DEFECTIVE 
There is another way of expressing the same matter. We 
may say that any individual is always hazy in his efforts to 
recall past situations. His memory images are only partial. 
What is true of the individual is true also of the race. Its 
memories of its earlier struggles are incomplete. The diffi- 
culty of recording, as well as the difficulty of recognizing, 
the full details of any situation will always hamper the his- 
torian. The result is that the memory of the race is more 
defective than the memory of an individual who tries to 
recall his own past experiences. 
   
-P-A-G-E-390
880 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
This defective material is, however, regarded by the stu- 
dent as an adequate basis for a final judgment as to relative 
merits. He will more commonly err in his judgments than 
be right if he takes the position that his history is complete 
and his knowledge adequate. The historians, therefore, are 
striving, so far as they can, to impress upon teachers and 
students the necessity of being very cautious in condemning 
or eulogizing those who are described in history. One should 
be slow to pass moral judgments upon any historical char- 
acter. At the same time, there can be no doubt that his- 
torical material stimulates any student to just this sort of 
consideration of the ethical values of all sorts of human 
relations. It is almost impossible to conduct a high-school 
course in American history which does not present to the 
student again and again the opportunities for forming his 
own judgments about the propriety of certain historical 
acts. It is inherent in history, as a subject, that it stimu- 
lates all sorts of human judgments. The student’s imagina- 
tion is kindled by the accounts given of human activities, 
and his sympathies are aroused in spite of every effort that 
he may make to keep his mind open for an impartial judg- 
ment. The effort of the historian, therefore, to describe 
history as a scientific subject is likely to fail to persuade an 
elementary student whose human sympathies are aroused 
by the narrative which he reads. 
CHRONOLOGICAL JUDGMENT MUST BE TRAINED 
There is one type of special judgment which may be 
regarded as peculiar to history. The student must learn, 
through his historical studies, to have a proper judgment 
with regard to time and the sequence of events in time. 
The Committee of Five has called attention in an interest- 
ing way to the importance of training students in this mat- 
ter of time judgments. This report recommends that the 
 
-P-A-G-E-391
HISTORY 381 
division between ancient and medieval history be set at 
the year 800 rather than at the year 476. The reason for 
this recommendation, as given in the report, is that if the 
earlier date is chosen the student is likely to think of an- 
cient civilization as wholly set off from modern civilization. 
In this case the student loses the continuity of civilization 
and has a distorted chronological idea. 
This single example can be elaborated by other examples 
from the experience of students. We may properly refer 
to the fact that little children in the elementary schools 
have no more notion of periods of time than they have of 
great spatial areas. The little child beginning his study of 
geography is seriously handicapped by the fact that he has 
never seen any large land areas. The space world, as he 
learns about it, is symbolical and abstract. In the same 
way the child has difficulty with time. Indeed, his difficulty 
with time is even greater than his difficulty with space. Lit- 
tle children very seldom know the difference between yester- 
day and the day before. Their memories are confused with 
regard to the dating of past experiences. As they grow 
older and have behind them a whole series of years of 
experience, they gain somewhat in ability to think of time 
and to mark off the different epochs of their own personal 
experience; but the long ranges of time continue to be 
extremely difficult for them to imagine and to fill up with 
historical events. The meager outlines of history which are 
given to them pass over centuries with a few isolated state- 
ments which make it quite impossible for the child to com- 
prehend anything about the actual time units with which 
history deals. If his historical material is arranged in such a 
way that one body of descriptions stops at a certain definite 
date and a later body of information begins at a later date, 
there will be, exactly as the Committee of Five has pointed 
out, a break in his thought about historical sequences. His 
whole study of time is abstract. When dates are given to   
      
   
-P-A-G-E-392
  3882 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
him in such a way as to mark breaches between different 
types of civilization, the dates will be very impressive in 
controlling his abstract thought about civilization. 
DEVIcES FOR TRAINING OF CHRONOLOGICAL JUDGMENT 
Various devices have at different times been used in 
school work to overcome this difficulty of establishing ade- 
quate chronological notions in history. In the older courses 
a pictured stream of events was often hung on the wall so 
as to keep constantly before the child’s mind the continuity 
and breadth of the centuries through which he was supposed 
to pass in his historical studies. The complexity of such a 
graphic chart becomes so great if one studies in detail any 
historical period that the charts which were familiar on the 
walls of school buildings a generation or two ago have 
gradually been eliminated because the amount of material 
which the student is supposed to compass has increased to 
such an extent that these charts are no longer acceptable. 
Sometimes teachers attempt to substitute a series of defi- 
nite points in history for the picture of the whole sequence of 
events. The student is required to learn a set of important 
dates. Here again the difficulty is to limit the emphasis which 
shall be given to particular dates, and there is grave danger 
that the student’s experience will be more broken up and sub- 
divided by these dates than developed into asingle continuity. 
The abandonment of the chart device and the difficulty 
of getting a useful series of dates should not lead teachers 
to neglect the task of cultivating in students a system 
of chronological judgments. Students must be taught the 
meaning of a century and of a decade. They must learn 
to arrange events in sequence and in parallel. It requires 
constant attention on the part of the teacher to render 
these judgments clear and adequate, but the task is one of 
the essential aspects of history teaching. 
 
-P-A-G-E-393
  HISTORY 383 
CAUSAL JUDGMENT 
A second type of judgment which is frequently empha- 
sized in historical study is the causal judgment which the 
student is supposed to cultivate in the presence of historical 
facts. The Committee of Five has commented on this mat- 
ter as follows: 
History cultivates the judgment by leading ‘the pupil to see 
the relation between cause and effect, as cause and effect appear 
in human affairs. We do not mean by this that his attention 
should be directed solely to great moving causes, or that he 
should study what is sometimes called the “ philosophy of his- 
tory” —far from it; nor do we mean that time should be 
consumed in discussing the meaning of facts when the facts 
themselves are not known. But history has to do with the 
becoming of past events, — not simply with what was, but with 
what came to be,—and in studying the simplest forms of his- 
torical narrative even the average pupil comes to see that one 
thing leads to another; he begins quite unconsciously to see 
that events do not simply succeed each other in time, but that 
one grows out of another, or rather out of a combination of 
many others. Thus, before the end of the secondary course, 
the well-trained pupil has acquired some power in seeing rela- 
tionships and detecting analogies. While it is perfectly true 
that the generalizing faculty is developed late, and that the 
secondary pupil will often learn unrelated data with ease, if 
not with avidity, it is equally true that history in the hands 
of the competent teacher is a great instrument for developing 
in the pupil capacity for seeing underlying reasons and for 
comprehending motives. (P. 21.) 
ForMAL STATEMENT OF RESULTS VERSUS JUDGMENT 
The danger which arises in attempting to train students 
of history to acquire causal judgments is similar to that 
which was discussed in an earlier chapter in commenting 
on the serious difficulty of getting students to do scientific 
 
-P-A-G-E-394
    384 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
thinking for themselves. Most of the causes and effects 
which students of history really canvass in their school work 
are given to them as the result of someone else’s thought 
rather than as a result of their own reaction upon the sit- 
uations which they study. They learn a list of causes and 
a list of effects, substituting this purely formal list for any 
genuine, personal thought about the situations under ex- 
amination. It is not necessary here to recanvass the com- 
ments which were made in the chapter on the teaching of 
science ; it is enough to point out that the causal relations 
in history are by no means as obvious as the causal relations 
in science. History is in this respect, therefore, a much 
more complicated subject than science as an instrument 
for teaching children to pass causal judgments. Causes 
in human society and in human behavior are frequently so 
obscure that they become matters of speculation if they 
are commented upon at all. This does not prove by any 
means that causal discussions should be eliminated from the 
history course, but it does make it perfectly clear that the 
teacher who lays great stress upon causal relations is deal- 
ing with a more complex type of material in history than 
in any other subject of the curriculum. 
THE CRITICAL EXAMINATION OF HisToRICAL EvIDENCE 
Finally, as has been frequently pointed out, history is 
designed to create in the mind of the student a critical 
attitude toward the evidences which are presented to him 
in historical narratives. This statement may be subdivided 
into two special statements of the way in which this train- 
ing may be given. In the first place, historical evidence is 
very largely a matter of documents. The student must 
therefore become familiar with the use of books. Indeed, 
it may be pointed out, without fear of dispute, that the 
history course, if properly conducted, is more likely than
-P-A-G-E-395
  
HISTORY 385 
any other course in the school to familiarize the student 
with methods of using the library for reference. He must 
come in contact with the sources of his material. Critical 
judgment will naturally develop during the student’s effort 
to secure his material. 
There is a higher form of critical judgment which comes 
not through the mere collection of material but through 
the comparison of different authorities with each other. 
This higher form of critical judgment has sometimes been 
essayed in the secondary schools. It has been assumed 
that students can be brought in contact with old newspapers 
and with the reminiscences of some of the older members 
of the community, and that they will be able, through a 
comparison of the information collected from these differ- 
ent sources, to develop the true narrative of historical 
events. In the main it has been found that elementary 
students are not competent to carry on any large amount 
of work with original sources. It appears, on the other 
hand, to be very stimulating for any student to be brought 
into contact with some of the original sources. Undoubtedly 
extracts from contemporary writings constitute a very le- 
gitimate part of the collateral reading for any historical 
course; but the assumption that this can be made the sole 
or leading method of instruction in secondary schools has 
proved itself to be in opposition to the experiences of those 
who have attempted to use the source method in secondary- 
school instruction. The psychological reason for the ina- 
bility of secondary-school students to study merely sources 
is not far to seek. The weighing of evidence requires a 
detached, impersonal attitude which is not easy for a 
student to assume. Furthermore, the complexity of such 
problems of the comparison of evidence takes the student’s 
attention away from the central historical sequence which 
he is supposed to be following, with the result that he gets 
no adequate historical narrative. In general the sifting of
-P-A-G-E-396
  386 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
evidence is the business of the specialist. The elementary 
student gets his best view of the course of events if he 
is saved the complexities of research. 
TRAINING IMAGINATION 
One of the strictly psychological topics which has fre- 
quently been made the subject of comment in the reports 
of committees on history courses is the subject of imagina- 
tion and the part which it plays in historical courses. The 
report of the Committee of Seven was criticized in some 
quarters because it assumed on the part of high-school 
students a power of abstraction which the experience of 
teachers did not justify. The Committee of Five, in can- 
vassing this question, evidently sees the wisdom of empha- 
sizing in the high-school course the cultivation of a great 
deal of concrete imagery on the part of students. Their 
comment on this matter is as follows: 
The secondary pupil must deal with real facts and with real 
men, with institutions as men worked in them and with them; 
he must have time to think and read as well as to learn. We 
must not forget that history merits a place in the curriculum 
because of its distinctly educational value; by it the pupil 
learns how the toil and labor of the past generations made the 
present; he learns to read and think of social problems. Such 
ends are not attained by any unreal and impersonal treatment 
of institutions and processes, or by the memorizing of chrono- 
logical outlines. (P. 22.) 
Ancient history must be made simpler and less abstract; 
more attention must be paid to great men, less to the history 
of institutions; more time must be given to simple studies of 
art and habits of life; wars that mean nothing must be omitted, 
and time must be gained for easy, familiar talks and lessons 
about things that pupils of fourteen can understand. Consti- 
tutional details must give place to pictures and to stories of 
the great deeds and achievements of antiquity. An attempt 
to show just how this can be done. would be out of place here. 
 
-P-A-G-E-397
  HISTORY 387 
There is an undoubted demand for textbooks that will aid the 
teachers in this difficult task; and there is need of abundant 
and cheap illustrative material. But the task must rest with the 
teacher. Difficult as it is, there is reason for thinking that it will 
be mastered. We feel confidence in saying that there is no other 
field of history so rich in materials of human interest and which 
can be made more vivid and comprehensible; but pupils will 
probably not be fired to enthusiasm by the reforms of Clisthenes, 
the duties of archons, the campaigns of the Samnite war, or the 
technicalities of the Roman constitution. (P. 36.)   
There can be no doubt at all that the reconstruction of 
historical scenes is one of the best devices for elementary 
instruction in history. It must, indeed, be kept in mind 
that the historical course cannot deal exclusively with the 
mere description of events; but there is so much that is in- 
volved in the true representation of past situations that the 
student is likely by this method to get a training in historical 
criticism and historical judgment which he cannot get if he 
is not required to be exact and accurate in his descriptions. 
DEVICES FOR STIMULATING AND DIRECTING 
IMAGINATION 
A method which has of late come into vogue for histor- 
ical study is the dramatic method of presenting historical 
events. The historical drama, like all imaginary pictures 
which the student must develop, calls for the careful scru- 
tiny of much material. Students learn a great deal about 
Roman history from an effort to dramatize Julius Cesar. 
Their attention is called to details of costume and details 
of social life which they would pass over if these were pre- 
sented merely in verbal form without any clear appreciation 
of their meaning or exact character. On the other hand, 
there can be no doubt that the vividness of the dramatic 
presentation is so great that there is danger of substituting 
the scene, as partially worked out in the drama, for the 
 
-P-A-G-E-398
  388 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
more complete personal idea which the student would have 
to cultivate if the drama had not been worked out for him. 
The difficulty which is here pointed out is akin to that 
which was pointed out in discussing solid geometry, where 
attention was called to the fact that many teachers in solid 
geometry prefer to get on without a model of the figure 
which the students are studying. The reason there presented 
was that students fail to cultivate their imaginations just in 
the degree in which they are relieved from exercising their 
imaginations through the presence of real objects. 
So here, if the historical drama is too vivid the student 
may substitute that which he sees for that which he ought 
to work out in his own thought. This difficulty is in some 
measure corrected by the historical pageant, which in many 
cases is a substitute for the drama. The historical pageant 
merely reviews the figures involved in historical scenes, 
giving some of the details of their appearance, but does 
not attempt to work out in detail all of their activities. 
There is, therefore, a stronger appeal to the imagination of 
the student in the pageant than in the drama. 
Inpustridu History As A SUBSTITUTE FOR 
PouiricAL History 
One direction in which recent history studies have aimed 
to cultivate the thought and imagination of students more 
completely than was formerly the practice is in the direc- 
tion of a full knowledge of the historical life of the common 
people. History has been remote from the experience of 
the ordinary student because the characters dealt with have 
been exclusively the leaders in the political and military 
world. If history is to be utilized by the ordinary student 
in cultivating any appreciative knowledge of earlier periods, 
he must have, as a part of his subject of thought, the life 
of people who, like himself, move in the common planes.
-P-A-G-E-399
  
HISTORY 389 
History of the purely military or political type has proved 
to be so barren for the student that there was a great recoil 
from the formalism of this type of content. This recoil from 
purely political history shows again how the historical course 
aims to cultivate the personal sympathies and personal judg- 
ments of all the students. There can be no doubt that his- 
tory makes a large advance just in the degree in which it 
arouses in the student those more intimate forms of sym- 
pathy and judgment which are needed to put the individual 
in contact with the full life of earlier generations. 
APPLICATION OF HistoRY TO PRESENT CONDITIONS 
Writers on history frequently call attention to the fact 
that students ought to be able to apply the history which 
they read to the present. This application must often take 
the form of contrast. The student is made vividly aware 
of present modes of institutional life by having his atten- 
tion drawn to the fact that other nations and other ages 
have dealt with situations in a way wholly different from 
that which he observes in present institutions. On the other 
hand, the application of history to present, institutions may 
take a more direct form if the student is made acquainted 
with the reason for the present mode of organization. Take 
such an institution as the United States Congress with its 
two Houses. What is the historical origin of this body ? 
We have here an interesting constitutional question which 
can be discussed from the point of view of its history in such 
a way as to make the student clearly aware of the reason 
for the dual organization of this legislative body. 
A very productive suggestion has recently been made in 
the method of historical presentation, in that some event of 
crucial significance in the life of the nation has been made 
the starting point for a backward inquiry as to the causes 
that led up to this particular event. If one could determine 
 
-P-A-G-E-400
890 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
step by step the different conditions that had made inevi- 
table the present situation, he would have an historical 
study which, in its applications, would be perfectly obvi- 
ous since the historical study would be undertaken for the 
purpose of giving an explanation of the present situation. 
In general, history begins at the chronologically remote 
point, and the application to the present is reserved for a 
later period of the course. Application thus becomes an 
extremely difficult part of the work. It would be inter- 
esting for some vigorous secondary-school teacher to try 
the experiment which, as indicated in the foregoing para- 
graph, has been tried in more advanced courses offered 
to research students. 
History A CENTER OF CORRELATIONS 
History, more than any other subject in the curriculum, 
has been studied with regard to its correlation to other 
subjects. The Herbartians called attention to the impor- 
tance of history as a central subject in the curriculum. In 
view of the fact that the training of the younger members 
of the race is the natural outgrowth of the historical devel- 
opment of the race, it seems very natural to point out that 
historical studies can be utilized as the best instruments for 
introducing children to the institutions in which they must 
live. The Herbartians, therefore, would make the historical 
narrative the basis for the development of all of the other 
forms of school work. They would allow science to attach 
itself to the historical narrative and to receive that emphasis 
which can be justified by reference to the relations between 
science and industry. Especially would they show the re- 
lation between geography and history, calling attention to 
the fact that the movements of races and their economic 
undertakings all depend on the physical environment in 
which they grow up.

                                                              All of these correlations between history and the other 
subjects emphasize the fact, which has been pointed out again 
and again in this discussion, that history is a very broad sub- 
ject in its content and in the judgments which it aims 
to cultivate in students. There is one practical suggestion 
which tends to utilize the possibility of correlating history 
with other subjects and serves at the same time to supply 
a way out of a difficulty mentioned in an earlier discussion. 
It has been recommended that a good deal of the English 
work which is now apparently without motive and lacking 
in proper content could be made more productive if the 
time that is consumed in aimless writing and reading trivial 
material could be related in some way to the requirements 
of the history course. At all events, there can be no doubt 
at all that a broad subject like history invites a broader 
type of training than most of the special subjects in the 
curriculum. The teacher of history should be sufficiently 
interested in these relations to work out material which will 
satisfy the legitimate demand for correlation of his subject 
with the other courses. 
Finally, in this connection it is interesting to note that the 
demand is being felt more than ever for a study of the history 
of industry. This demand grows out of the development 
of technical courses in secondary schools, which technical 
courses are demanding the same kind of academic back- 
ground as that which has heretofore been provided for the 
other subjects of the curriculum. 
' The remaining topics which might be taken up in dis- 
cussing history as a special subject are topics which have 
already been touched upon in discussing other subjects in 
the curriculum, and we may with propriety turn over to 
a series of general chapters such problems as discipline, 
methods of study, and the organization of the students’ 
curriculum.

CHAPTER XVII 
GENERALIZED EXPERIENCE 
ATTACKS ON THE DocTRINE oF FoRMAL DISCIPLINE 
Discussions of formal discipline have been carried on 
with vigor and keen partisan feeling during the last two 
decades. The report of the Committee of Ten! stimulated 
Professor Hinsdale? and others to open the discussion in 
terms of Herbartian psychology and pedagogy. Following 
this report of the Committee of Ten came a series of statis- 
tical investigations and experiments by students of educa- 
tional psychology. Those who are not interested especially 
in the scientific study of education have been drawn into 
the controversy. The discussion was taken up by the 
opponents of the classics who found that the arguments 
in favor of the teaching of the classics in the schools were 
couched in a terminology which made the classicists appear 
as the natural defenders of the doctrine of discipline. At- 
tacks on the doctrine were especially welcome to representa- 
tives of the new subjects which base their claims for their 
reception into the course of study upon the rich variety of 
content which they offer to the student. The sciences, for 
example, have been assumed to contain so much valuable 
information capable of practical application to the activities 
of ordinary life that the advocates of these subjects have 
been very glad to see the classics under fire because of their

alleged inability to furnish training that can be recognized 
as of immediate practical value. 
It will be noted from the foregoing remarks that the dis- 
cussion has been from the outset of a partisan type, and to-day 
it bears all of the marks of an intense partisan controversy. 
There is very little sobriety of statement on either side. 
The classicists, still feeling that they must defend their sub- 
jects as giving a type of mental training which will be val- 
uable to the student, and finding that the very terms which 
they employ are under criticism by students of educational 
psychology, are bitter in their counter attacks upon every- 
body, including students of the science of education. In 
some cases they have felt it necessary to go so far as to assert 
that there is nothing at all in the science of education. On 
the other hand, the opponents of the classics have made the 
most extreme statements, holding that the argument that 
a subject disciplines the mind is an absolutely unacceptable 
ground for the admission or continuance of any subject in 
the school curriculum. 
EXTREME CRITICS ASK FOR REFORMULATION 
There are some evidences that this partisan discussion 
has reached its climax and that we are now in a position to 
take up the seriotis scientific discussion of the doctrine of 
formal discipline and its meaning. For example, Thorndike, 
who has long posed as one of the strongest opponents of 
the doctrine of formal discipline, writes in the second vol- 
ume of his “ Educational Psychology”! as follows: 
These experimental facts as a whole, like those concerning 
memorizing, leave a rather confused impression on one’s mind, 
and resist organization into any simple statement of how far 
the improvement wrought by special practice spreads beyond 
the function primarily exercised. They do, however, at least

of Learning, pp. 417, 418. Teachers College, 1913. 
 
-P-A-G-E-404
  394 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
put out of court the old doctrine of a very wide spread of a 
very large percentage of the special improvement. Possibly 
nobody really believed that the improvement made in reasoning 
about Latin syntax would spread equally, or almost equally, 
to all or nearly all varieties of reasoning; but men wrote as 
if they believed substantially this. Certainly nobody can now 
believe it in the face of these experiments. 
It is indeed doubtful whether anyone ever held the ex- 
treme views sometimes described by the opponents of the 
doctrine of formal discipline. This fundamental ambiguity 
is amusingly illustrated in such cases as the following. We 
find O’Shea! complaining bitterly because he cannot find any- 
one who will state the doctrine of formal discipline in such 
a way that he can attack it to his heart’s content. He says: 
Those who profess to believe in the virtues of formal mental 
discipline are still not willing to carry it to its logical conclu- 
sions. They will not say that any particular sort of mental 
activity will benefit the mind on every side. They maintain 
rather that the training of perception in any direction improves 
the power of perception in every direction, but not the power of 
reason, or memory, or imagination. Here the theory that all pos- 
sible mental functions are benefited in the same degree by any va- 
riety of experience is abandoned, and it is implied that there are 
various departments, as it were, to the mind, from each of which 
may be produced special articles of mental merchandise accord- 
ing to the needs of the moment. We cannot draft the power de- 
veloped by exercising the perceiving faculty, for instance, into 
the service of the remembering faculty ; nor can power of mem- 
ory be utilized in carrying forward reason or imagination, 
The same sort of complaint is made by Heck :? 
Finally, we notice that adherents of the doctrine of formal 
discipline shrink from carrying their doctrine to its logical

conclusions, namely, the exact equivalents of studies for mental 
discipline or, if a distinction is made between them, the concen- 
tration on a single superior study for the training of a given 
power or set of powers. In practice, if not in theory, these ad- 
herents acknowledge a variation in training of a given power 
or set of powers as related to a variation in content of study. 
A case in point is the inconsistency of the Committee of Ten 
on Secondary School Studies in stating what seems to be a be- 
lief in the equivalence of studies and then specifying elaborately 
varied curricula, representing different phases of the environ- 
ment, different subject-matter and method. 
CAsE AGAINST ForMAL DISCIPLINE EXAGGERATED 
One might go on multiplying examples from the writings 
of the opponents of the doctrine of formal discipline to show 
that they have never really succeeded in finding the extreme 
position which they like to attack actually represented by 
any one of the advocates of the doctrine. It is interesting 
to note that the quotations which are given by Thorndike 
and others in support of their contention that the doctrine 
of formal discipline has been whole-heartedly advocated by 
teachers of the classics and their friends are very labored. 
For example, if one takes the first quotation used by 
Thorndike in the successive reprints! of his attack upon 
the doctrine of formal discipline, he finds the following, on 
the whole, fairly innocuous statement: 
Since the mind is a unit and the faculties are simply phases 
or inanifestations of its activity, whatever strengthens one fac- 
ulty indirectly strengthens all the others. The verbal memory 
seems to be an exception to this statement, however, for it may 
be abnormally cultivated without involving to any profitable 
extent the other faculties. But only things that are rightly 
perceived and rightly understood can be rightly remembered. 
Hence whatever develops the acquisitive and assimilative 
1 For example, Educational Psychology, Vol. II, p. 360.
-P-A-G-E-406
    3896 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
powers will also strengthen memory; and, conversely, rightly 
strengthening the memory necessitates the developing of other 
powers. (R. N. Roark, “ Method in Education,” p. 27.) 
EXTREME CRITICS APPEAR AT TIMES AS ARDENT 
ADVOCATES 
It will be noted that this quotation, presented by Thorn- 
dike as the first example of the teachings of the advocates 
of formal discipline which he feels compelled to refute, dif- 
fers very little from statements which might be extracted 
from Thorndike’s own writings. For example, on a later 
page of the same volume! he reprints with evident satisfac- 
tion an extract from one of his own earlier works as follows: 
Identity of Procedure. — The habit acquired in a laboratory 
course of looking to see how chemicals do behave, instead of 
guessing at the matter or learning statements about it out of a 
book, may make a girl’s methods of cooking or a boy’s methods 
of manufacturing more scientific because the attitude of distrust 
of opinion and search for facts may so possess one as to be car- 
ried over from the narrower to the wider field. Difficulties in 
studies may prepare students for the difficulties of the world 
as a whole by cultivating the attitudes of neglect of discomfort, 
ideals of accomplishing what one sets out to do, and the feeling 
of dissatisfaction with failure. 
It will be remembered that identity of procedure and prac- 
tice is what Roark is advocating in the earlier paragraph. 
Furthermore, one may turn to those who have been influ- 
enced by Thorndike’s writings for examples which illustrate 
admirably the difficulty of distinguishing between those who 
are in favor of formal discipline and those who are not. 
In his interesting book, “The Teaching of Physics,” Pro- 
fessor Mann? is very clear in the earlier chapters that the

doctrine of formal discipline should be violently attacked. 
He says on page 183: \ 
The first point to be noted is that training in any subject is 
specific, not general. ... Thinking, like training, is always spe- 
cific, that is, connected with some practical situation and depend- 
ent upon the specific nature of the situation as a whole. 
One hardly settles his mind to the acceptance of this doc- 
trine of specific discipline when he comes, on page 214, to 
the following wholesale adoption of the doctrine of formal 
discipline : 
Discipline in the methods of acquiring this useful knowledge 
results not only in skill in weighing evidence and in criticising 
and testing data, in openmindedness or the ability of holding 
conclusions tentatively and of altering them whenever new 
evidence demands it, and in the ability of predicting conse- 
quences and of making judgments that shall have the great- 
est possible degree of validity; but also in self-forgetfulness, 
perseverance, self-respect, and resourcefulness in the face of 
difficulties. 
CRITICISMS OF THE REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF TEN 
Perhaps the above quotations will be enough to convince 
the impartial reader why it is very difficult to find anyone 
sufficiently clear on the doctrine of formal discipline to be 
accepted as a suitable target for those who suppose them- 
selves to be in opposition to this doctrine. One other ex- 
ample, however, of the partisan spirit of this discussion may 
be cited in view of the reference made by Hinsdale,! Heck,! 
and others to the report of the Committee of Ten. This 
report has been referred to in many quarters as advocating 
the doctrine of formal discipline. If we turn to the minority 
report of the Committee presented by Baker we find the 
1 Report of the Committee of Ten, Edition of 1894, pp. 56, 57. Amer- 
ican Book Company. 
 
-P-A-G-E-408
  898 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
following statements which indicate that Baker himself 
evidently thought that the rest of the Committee were 
in favor of. formal discipline: 
I cannot endorse expressions that appear to sanction the idea 
that the choice of subjects in secondary schools may be a mat- 
ter of comparative indifference. I note especially the following 
sentences, referring the reader to their context for accurate 
interpretation. 
“Any school principal may say:—‘ With the staff at my com- 
mand I can teach only five subjects out of those proposed by 
Conferences in the manner proposed. My school shall, there- 
fore, be limited to these five.’ Another school may be able to 
teach in the thorough manner proposed five subjects, but some 
or all of these five may be different from those selected by the 
first school. 
“If twice as much time is given in a school to Latin as is 
given to mathematics, the attainments of the pupils in Latin 
ought to be twice as great as they are in mathematics, provided 
that equally good work is done in the two subjects; and Latin 
will have twice the educational value of mathematics. 
“ The schedule of studies contained in Table III permits flex- 
ibility and variety in three respects. First, it is not necessary 
that any school should teach all the subjects which it contains, 
or any particular set of subjects. 
“Every youth who entered college would have spent four 
years in studying a few subjects thoroughly ; and on the theory 
that all the subjects are to be considered equivalent in educa- 
tional rank for the purpose of admission to college, it would 
make no difference which subjects he had chosen from the pro- 
gramme — he would have had four years of strong and effective 
mental training.” 
All such statements are based upon the theory that, for the 
purposes of general education, one study is as good as another, 
—a theory which appears to me to ignore Philosophy, Psychol- 
ogy and Science of Education. It is a theory which makes 
education formal and does not consider the nature and value 
of the content. Power comes through knowledge; we cannot 
conceive of observation and memory in the abstract.
-P-A-G-E-409
  GENERALIZED EXPERIENCE 399 
CRITICISM BASED ON OBVIOUS MISINTERPRETATION 
Inasmuch as the Committee’s report itself contains a 
minority statement which thus charges the Committee 
with adherence to the doctrine of formal discipline, and 
inasmuch as this tradition about the Committee of Ten 
has been perpetuated in some of the later discussions of 
the subject, it may be well to call attention to the fact 
that the last paragraph in Baker’s quotation, which is also 
quoted by Hinsdale and others, was written not as a part 
of a discussion of the general educational value of high- 
school subjects but rather as part of a statement dealing 
with the organizing of a college preparatory course. What 
the Committee asserted was that the high school of to-day 
cannot formulate its course of study with a view merely to 
preparing for college. The school must organize its courses 
in such a way as to offer to all of the young people in the 
community as large a range of subjects as possible with a 
view to preparing them for the ordinary duties of citizen- 
ship. This is the principle which the Committee lays at 
the foundation of its various programs of study. Having 
organized the course of study for the high school in this 
general way, it finds that the problem of preparing for 
college must be treated as a secondary problem. The 
Committee holds that the preparation for college, being a 
relatively incidental matter, will be adequately taken care 
of within the limits of the courses which it has arranged 
if all the subjects which are taught are raised to a uniform 
level of excellence. All of the different courses being 
regarded by the Committee as of value for the training of 
a student, the student who is to go to college may extract 
from the total series of possibilities those particular courses 
which he wishes to elect. The college may safely rely upon 
the outcome of this secondary training because it has been 
completely and thoroughly organized in the general programs

400 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
laid down by the Committee. It is at this point that the 
statement quoted from the Committee’s report appears. 
How anyone could read this report and find justifications 
for Baker’s minority report, or for the statement made by 
Heck and quoted on page 394, is difficult for an unbiased 
student of education to determine. Certainly there must 
be in any social or educational situation which permits this 
partisan misinterpretation much greater intensity of partisan 
feeling than sobriety of intellectual evaluation of positions. 
HADLEY ON GREEK AND FoRMAL DISCIPLINE 
One further quotation may be added to show that the 
statements of those who are in favor of the general doctrine 
of formal discipline are by no means so extreme on the one 
hand as has been assumed by the opponents of this doctrine, 
nor on the other hand greatly at variance with Thorndike 
and others who are in favor of the doctrine of identity of 
procedure. The following quotation from the presidential 
report of President Hadley in 1909 is an admirable state- 
ment of the doctrine. 1 
One of the chief causes which have given the teaching of 
Greek its importance in American colleges was well stated in 
President Garfield’s inaugural. 
“That some subjects produce better results than others in 
the same general group is due rather to the accident of time 
and to perfection of method, than to qualities inherent in the 
subjects. Consider, for example, the teaching of Greek. Both 
the language and the method of instruction have been stand- 
ardized, if I may borrow a term from the shops. This result 
has come about, in part, because the language is ‘dead,’ thereby 
lending itself to fixed methods of analysis and treatment, and 
in part because it has been studied long enough, since its

revival, to enable teachers to agree upon the authors to be read 
and the order in which their work can most profitably be placed 
before the student. 
“ These considerations give to Greek, as to Latin, a peculiar 
claim to consideration as a discipline, wholly aside from the 
question of literary quality and historic value.” 
What does this last sentence mean? It means, I think, that 
if a man has passed an examination in Greek, you know that 
he has studied Greek to some purpose, and is likely to work to 
the same purpose in other things that he may take up. Greek 
is an intellectual game where the umpires know the rules better 
than they know the rules in the game of French, for instance, 
or history, or botany. A man’s rating in an examination on 
any one of these last three subjects is largely the result of 
accident unless the examiner is quite unusually skillful. A 
man’s rating in Greek, on the other hand, means something. 
There never were intellectual competitions keener than the 
classical competitions at Oxford in the days when the best men 
in England wanted their sons to learn that particular game. 
Unfortunately, a large number of the strongest men, both 
in England and in the United States, have decided that this 
game takes more time than it is worth. Personally, I believe 
that this change of mind is in many respects a misfortune; that 
in trying to get more practical results in the way of knowledge 
or culture a great many American college boys have lost the 
training which the Greek would have given them and gained 
nothing of equal value in its place. But colleges cannot teach 
a thing to a public which does not want to study it; and we 
must recognize the fact that an increasing part of the American 
public does not care to have. its sons give the time necessary 
for the effective use of the Greek language as a means of 
competition and discipline. 
This makes academic problems more difficult. It is infinitely 
harder to manage a college where the students do not want to 
study Greek than one where they do. It is harder to enforce 
habits of regularity; harder to organize general intellectual 
competitions; harder to be sure that examination marks are a 
test of ability. But we must meet the facts as they are. We  
-P-A-G-E-412
402 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
-cannot decline solving the problem of to-day because we like 
the problem of yesterday better. 
It was a mistake for the advocates of the old curriculum to 
think that all the students required the same treatment. It is, 
I believe, an equal mistake for the advocates of the elective 
system to think that each student requires a different treat- 
ment. For while there is a very large number of subjects of 
interest to study, and an almost infinite variety of occupations 
which the students are going to follow afterwards, there is a 
comparatively small number of types of mind with which we 
have to deal. If we can have four or five honor courses, some- 
thing like those of the English universities, where the studies 
are grouped and the examinations arranged to meet the needs 
of these different types, we can, I think, realize the chief ad- 
vantages of the elective system or the group system without 
subjecting ourselves to their evils. Iam confident that we can 
secure a degree of collective intellectual interest which is now 
absent from most of our colleges, and can establish competi- 
tions which will be recognized not only in college but in the 
world as places where the best men can show what is in them. 
It may be objected that any such arrangement would render 
it difficult for a boy to study the particular things that he was 
going to use in after life. I regard this as its cardinal advan- 
tage. The ideal college education seems to me to be one where 
a student learns things that he is not going to use in after life, 
by methods that he is going to use. The former element gives 
the breadth, the latter element gives the training. 
DISTINCTION BETWEEN ForM AND ConTENT DIFFICULT 
A part of the misunderstanding regarding formal disci- 
pline grows out of the fact that the terms in which the 
discussion has been carried forward are themselves very 
unfortunate. In the first place, a distinction between for- 
mal subjects and content subjects is quite impossible to 
draw and has never been strictly adhered to in any of the 
discussions. One finds, for example, that Thorndike is 
constantly discussing identity of procedure and identity 
 
-P-A-G-E-413
  GENERALIZED EXPERIENCE 403 
of substance. His term “ procedure” may be regarded as 
synonymous with the term “form,” while his term “sub- 
stance” is synonymous with the term “content.” It is 
evident, therefore, that in his own mind the discussion is 
not limited to form on the one hand as distinguished from 
substance on the other, nor to content as distinguished 
from the modes of mental activity. 
REACTION AGAINST DISCIPLINE 
In the second place, the term “ discipline” undoubtedly 
carries to the minds of many thinkers an implied criticism. 
The term “discipline” reminds one of the early days of 
educational theory when it was assumed that the child is 
by nature unregenerate and perverse. The child must in 
some fashion be changed so that he will become an indi- 
vidual of the accepted type in society. This earlier notion 
about child nature had its sources in the theological preju- 
dices of the medieval period. It was assumed by the theo- 
logians who tried to frame their school work on the basis 
of a pietistic or puritanic religious theory that there is 
nothing in the world so bad as that which is natural. To- 
day we are all of us prepared to assume exactly the oppo- 
site attitude. Studies of mental development and of social 
organization have convinced all of us that Nature is con- 
stantly working for the improvement of the species and 
the individual. Nature provides devices which constantly 
make for betterment. Consequently, if we can do anything 
which will aid Nature in the processes which she is carrying 
on, we shall have worked to the advantage of all concerned. 
This attitude with regard to Nature makes us skeptical 
about any form of training which seems to run counter to 
Nature. When one reads Herbert Spencer’s unqualified 
statement that we may properly depend upon the child’s own 
judgment of what is agreeable to him, since all education 
 
-P-A-G-E-414
404 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
which is natural is sure to arouse a pleasurable feeling ; 
when one reads in the Herbartians that the child’s interest 
is a suitable criterion for the selection of school material 
and modes of procedure; when one reads the pleas of the 
students of physical education for more of the play type 
of activity in school work, he realizes that the day of disci- 
pline as a favorite educational concept is past. No one can 
get a hearing to-day for any doctrine which repudiates 
Nature at the outset. Consequently, the use of the term 
“discipline” is unfortunate. No subject can afford at the 
present time to bear the burden of this doctrine of disci- 
pline. If the classicists want an impartial hearing of their 
case, they should abandon that word altogether. What- 
ever virtues there may be in learning how to overcome dis- 
tractions ; whatever advantages there may be to the student 
in learning to concentrate his attention; he must be freed, 
so far as popular thought is concerned, from the necessity of 
doing all this in a way that is opposed to Nature. We must 
treat concentration as a natural characteristic of the mind. 
If we have to cultivate it by strenuous endeavors we must 
not say that the mind has been disciplined into concen- 
tration; we must say rather that the mind ought to be 
allowed to express its own tendencies. We must learn to 
use phrases which will free us from controversies with 
medievalism. 
No ONE DENIES THE Fact OF TRANSFER OF TRAINING 
The discussion of formal discipline as it has been carried 
on by recent writers can legitimately be expressed in en- 
tirely neutral terms. It is in fact a discussion of the degree 
to which training gained in one sphere of thought and 
activity can be transferred to other spheres of thought and 
activity. Special emphasis may furthermore be laid on the 
fact that there is no one who denies that some kind of 
 
-P-A-G-E-415

transfer takes place. The real questions at issue are what 
is the degree of transfer and what is its method. It should 
perhaps be reiterated that it is entirely out of keeping with 
the evidence to assume that there is anyone who believes 
that the transfer is uniform and absolute. Sometimes the 
opponents of the doctrine of formal discipline write as 
though they thought that the advocates of this doctrine 
believe in absolutely equal transfer in all directions. Note 
Thorndike’s comment quoted on page 893. Note also the 
statements that were made above from O’Shea and Heck, 
where it was pointed out that they cannot find anyone 
who goes the whole length of advocating complete transfer 
of powers. 
Tue REAL PROBLEM THAT OF DEGREE OF TRANSFER 
The fact is that in all of these cases the real question is 
one of degree. Thorndike’s statement of the problem which 
he wishes to discuss is thus somewhat biased by his confu- 
sion of two distinct problems. He himself admits that there 
is some degree of transfer. He wishes to put his opponents 
in the position of stating that the transfer is more general 
than he admits, and that it takes place by a method other 
than that which he accepts. His preliminary definitions are 
quoted from his “ Principles of Teaching.” 
The problem of how far the particular responses made day 
by day by pupils improve their mental powers in general is 
called the problem of the disciplinary value or disciplinary 
effect of studies, or more briefly, the problem of formal disci- 
pline. (P. 235.) 
A common answer of the theorists about human life and 
education has been that each special mental acquisition, each 
special form of training, improves directly and equally the 
general ability. Teachers have believed and acted on the theory 
1 E. L. Thorndike, The Principles of Teaching. A. G. Seiler, 1906. 
 
-P-A-G-E-416
  406 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
that the mind was a collection of faculties or powers — obser- 
vation, attention, memory, reasoning, will and the like —and 
that any gain in any faculty was a gain for the faculty as a 
whole. (P. 236.) 
The powers of the mind are supposed to work irrespective of 
the data with which they work. Improvement in one special 
power rarely, if ever, means equal improvement in general. 
(P. 237.) 
CriticAL EXAMINATION OF EVIDENCE BY CRITICS 
We shall first take up the problem of the degree of trans- 
fer. It would be simpler to marshal the abundant positive 
experimental evidence that transfer of a high degree is very 
common, but the rules of argumentation dictate that we 
use the material which has been the basis of the opposite 
conclusion. We turn, therefore, to Thorndike’s text for his 
evidence that transfer of training is very slight. We quote 
in full his statement.1 
The exact extent to which the improvement of any special 
capacity does improve other capacities than itself can be esti- 
mated from two lines of evidence, one concerning the extent 
to which special capacities are related one to another in the 
human mind and the other concerning the actual effect of special 
training on general ability as found by scientific investigations. 
Common observation should teach that mental capacities 
are highly specialized. A man may be a tip-top musician but 
in other respects an imbecile: he may be a gifted poet, but an 
ignoramus in music: he may have a wonderful memory for 
figures and only a mediocre memory for localities, poetry or 
human faces: school children may reason admirably in science 
and be below the average in grammar: those very good in 
drawing may be very poor in dancing. 
Careful measurements show that the specialization is even 
greater than ordinary observation leads one to suppose. For 
instance those individuals who are the highest ten out of a hun- 
dred in the power to judge differences in length accurately are 
1 The Principles of Teaching, pp. 288-240.
-P-A-G-E-417
  GENERALIZED EXPERIENCE 407 
by no means the highest ten in the ability to judge differences 
in weights accurately. In fact they are not very much above 
the average. The best ten out of a hundred in observing mis- 
spellings in words are not very much better off than the worst 
ten when we test their ability to observe the shape of objects. 
Similarly; quickness and accuracy in thinking of the sums of 
numbers by no means implies equal quickness and accuracy in 
thinking of the opposites of words. 
The records given below are samples of many that have been 
obtained by scientific students of education, all testifying to 
the complex specialization of human capacities, and the exist- 
ence of variations in any power according to the data with 
which it works.

Many facts such as these prove that the mind is by no means

memory, reasoning and the like, but is the sum total of count- 
less particular capacities, each of which is to some extent inde- 
pendent of the others, —each of which must to some extent 
be educated by itself. The task of teaching is not to develop 
a reasoning faculty, but many special powers of thought about 
different kinds of facts. It is not to alter our general power of 
attention, but to build up many particular powers of attending 
to different kinds of facts. 
A SIMPLER STATEMENT OF THE TABLES 
The student will understand these tables better if we 
recalculate them for him. In the first table individual A 
stands in the first position in English and in the second po- 
sition in languages. He is displaced, therefore, by one posi- 
tion. Individual B in this table is displaced eleven positions. 
If in this fashion we go through the whole table and indi- 
cate the amount of displacement, we find that there are two 
groups of cases. There is one group in which the displace- 
ment is very slight. Thus, there are seven members of the 
group of thirty who are not displaced at all; that is, they 
assume exactly the same position in the English series as 
in the foreign-language series. Seven members of the group 
of thirty suffer only a single point of displacement. There 
are four cases where the displacement is two positions ; five 
where the displacement is three ; three more where the dis- 
placement is five or less. We now have four scattering 
cases in which the displacement is very large. One of these 
cases has a displacement of nine; one, eleven ; one, sixteen ; 
and one, nineteen. 
Srrixine PositIvE AND NEGATIVE CORRELATIONS 
How an astute observer like Thorndike could fail to 
recognize that he has in these figures a very interesting 
indication of the fact which is known to every teacher is
-P-A-G-E-420
  410 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
difficult to understand. Teachers realize that there are 
some students who acquire in each study better equipment 
for general school work. There are other students who be- 
come so absorbed in a single line of training that they are 
actually interrupted in the rest of their school work. It is 
very easy to find in any school some member of the Latin 
class who has become so absorbed in this one subject that 
he neglects the rest of his work in order to be perfect in 
this subject. It would be natural to expect that such a stu- 
dent as this would suffer a very large displacement if his 
marks in Latin were compared with his marks in English. 
Thorndike’s table makes it perfectly clear that such 
facts lie before us in abundance in every class. Here are 
some students whose work correlates; others who show 
the sharpest contrasts. Why should anyone be satisfied to 
throw all these cases together, and shutting his eyes draw 
out an average? What does the average show? Nothing 
but this: in a large class there are enough different kinds 
of transfer so that if you mix them thoroughly you will 
find no transfer. Note that all you need to do if you want , 
to cover up correlations is to continue to mix until the 
desired result is reached. 
THE FALLACY OF USING TESTS WITHOUT CRITICAL 
INTERPRETATION 
A second fact which comes out in Thorndike’s tables is 
that our methods of testing students are such that it is 
extremely difficult to know how much transfer we ought 
to expect between the different functions under discussion. 
In the second and third tables presented above, investiga- 
tions are reported of the degrees of correlation between 
quickness and accuracy of observation and association, and 
between the abilities exhibited by high-school boys to dis- 
criminate lengths and weights. The table on discrimination
-P-A-G-E-421
  
GENERALIZED EXPERIENCE 411 
of lengths and weights, like the first table, shows a rela- 
tively very high degree of correlation. Students are dis- 
placed only in a few isolated instances more than seven or 
eight places. These few isolated instances, like the cases of 
negative correlation in the first table, are just as impor- 
tant to the educator and just as significant for educational 
theory as the cases of the students showing a high degree 
of positive correlation. Whenever two mental functions 
are opposed to each other the relationship between the two 
opposing functions is quite as important to the teacher as 
the relationship between two functions which codperate 
with each other. 
The second table, in which observation and association 
are contrasted with each other, shows a very wide disparity 
in the standings of individuals, but it does not follow from 
this disparity that it is the students who are responsible. 
Before an investigator begins to draw inferences from his 
tables he ought certainly to recognize the fact that a table 
depends for its significance on the kind of comparison which 
it institutes. Who could expect to compare the quickness 
and alertness in observation and association exhibited by 
fourth-grade girls with the same degree of finality as he 
could reach in comparing the attainments of college stu- 
dents in English and in foreign languages? It has long 
been recognized by all students of education that a single 
test is a very unreliable basis on which to make a general- 
ization. It would be very much better to throw out this 
table on observation and association than to attempt to 
build upon so slender a foundation the structure of a gen- 
eral educational doctrine, especially when this table differs 
so radically from the other two on the same page. 
This table also shows that the methods of investigation 
have much to do with the degree of transfer which is shown 
in any given situation. Furthermore, it is not merely the 
method of testing that influences the result; the method
-P-A-G-E-422
  412 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
of training is also of the greatest influence. Our school 
organization has undoubtedly been responsible for much of 
the separation between subjects under which students have 
suffered. In dealing with English, for éxample, we had 
frequent occasion to point out that the influence of Eng- 
lish courses is not general because of the way in which 
these courses are organized. The same type of argument 
may be applied to other courses in the curriculum. ~ 
The negative evidence offered by the critics of formal 
discipline thus turns out to be of the thinnest possible 
type. They have not only not proved a negative; they 
have presented a series of facts which calls loudly for 
affirmative discussion. 
WHAT Is THE METHOD OF TRANSFER ? 
We are thus brought to the second phase of our topic. 
It is, as we have seen, admitted on all sides that transfer 
of some degree takes place. The next question is, How 
does transfer take place, or, What conditions secure much 
transfer and what secure little ? 
TRANSFER DEPENDS ON THE POWER OF _ 
GENERALIZATION 
The first and most striking fact which is to be drawn 
from school experience is that one and the same subject 
matter may be employed with one and the same student 
with wholly different_effects, according to the mode of pres- 
entation. If the lesson is presented in one fashion it will 
produce a very large transfer; whereas if it is presented 
in an entirely different fashion it will be utterly barren of 
results for other phases of mental life. It is quite possible 
to take one of the objects of nature study, for example, 
and to teach it in such a way that it becomes an isolated 
 
-P-A-G-E-423
   GENERALIZED EXPERIENCE 413 
and utterly formal possession of the student. This has 
been illustrated time and time again by the instruction 
which has been given in birds and plants. A teacher can 
teach birds and plants in such a way as to arouse a mini- 
mum of ideas in the student’s mind. The training may be 
as formal in these content subjects as it ever was in lan- ~ 
guage instruction. On the other hand, the same subject 
matter may be taken by a different teacher, and under 
other methods can be made vital for the student’s whole 
thinking. Thus the teacher who is dealing with birds as a 
subject of nature study and secures an interest on the part 
of his students for the world in which these birds live, 
through an examination of the structures and habits of 
the birds, will have in this subject matter one of the most 
broadly interesting topics that can be taught. In exactly 
the same way a teacher who knows how to make use of 
the materials given in a Latin course may render this sub- 
‘ect very broadly productive, as contrasted with the teacher 
who merely gives the formal aspects of the subject. For- 
malism and lack of transfer turn out to be not characteris- 
tics of subjects of instruction, but rather products of the 
mode of instruction in these subjects. 
JAMES ON GENERALIZATION 
The important psychological fact involved in the above 
statements is that the extent to which a student general- 
izes his training is itself a measure of the degree to which 
he has secured from any course the highest form of train- 
ing. One of the major characteristics of human intelligence 
is to be defined by calling attention, as was pointed out in 
the chapter on science, to the fact that a human being is 
able to generalize his experience. James has discussed this 
matter by using the example of the animal trained to open 
a particular latch. The animal becomes acquainted with
-P-A-G-E-424
414 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
the necessary movements to open one door, but he never 
has the ability to generalize this experience. He cannot 
see that the same method of opening doors is applicable 
to many other latches. The result is that the animal goes 
through life with one particular narrow mode of behavior, 
and exhibits his lack of intelligence by his inability to carry 
this single type of skill over to the other cases which are 
very familiar to the trained human intelligence. 
James goes on to say that the same distinction appears 
when we contrast a trained scientific mind with the ordi- 
nary mind. The ordinary thinker does not see how to deal 
with a situation in terms of scientific principles. James 
cites the example of his own experience with a smoking 
student-lamp. He discovered by accident that the lamp 
would not smoke if he put something under the chimney so 
as to increase the air current, but he did not realize that 
what he had done was only one particular example of the 
general principle that combustion is favored by a large sup- 
ply of oxygen. The general principle and its useful appli- 
cation belong to a sphere of thinking and experience which 
the untrained layman has not yet mastered.! 
THE THEORY oF IDENTICAL ELEMENTS LoosE AND 
Be AMBIGUOUS 
When one studies the psychology of generalization he 
becomes aware of the uselessness of some of the formulas 
which have been proposed by those who hold that transfer 
of training takes place in cases where there are identical 
elements present. The identical element is usually con- 
tributed by the generalizing mind. On the other hand, 
there may be identical elements potentially present in vari- 
ous situations, but wholly unobserved by the untrained 
or lethargic mind. In fact, the discovery of the identical 
1 Principles of Psychology, Vol. II, p. 339. 
   
-P-A-G-E-425
  GENERALIZED EXPERIENCE 415 
element in a situation is in some cases the whole problem of 
training. Take the famous illustration of Newton’s dis- 
covery. He saw for the first time that the relation between 
the moon and the earth is identical in character with the 
relation between the earth and everything which falls toward 
its center. The discovery of this identity in the two situa- 
tions was’ the great achievement of a scientific mind. The 
discovery of identical elements in all of the Indo-European 
languages was the achievement of the students of compar- 
ative philology who a generation ago established the broad 
principles of the scientific study of grammar and word 
structure. The discovery of identical elements in two sit- 
uations was in both cases an achievement of trained minds 
applying themselves to situations which heretofore had de- 
fied analysis. Or we might borrow our illustrations from the 
world of mechanics. The discovery of a common mechan- 
ical principle in all of the situations which involve the use 
of the wedge and the inclined plane is an achievement of 
mature physical science. Primitive man did not recognize 
in these different situations a common principle, nor was 
he able to carry over from one practical device to other 
practical situations the experiences that he had accumulated 
in the accidental use of one tool after another. We may 
express this limitation of primitive intelligence by saying 
that although common modes of procedure were possible 
in these different cases, they were not discovered. 
BAGLEY ON TRANSFER OF NEATNESS 
Let us see how the same general criticism applies to 
the discussion of another well-known case. The frequently 
quoted experiments which Bagley utilizes in his discussion 
of formal discipline! show that children who had been taught 
1 W.C. Bagley, The Educative Process, p. 208. The Macmillan Com- 
pany, 1908. ap
-P-A-G-E-426
416 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
in the schools to keep their papers neat in the arithmetic 
class did not adopt the same mode of procedure in other 
lines of work. It was ‘of course possible for them to find 
in the other classes opportunities for neatness equal to those 
which were presented in arithmetic. They might have 
adopted the same mode of procedure. There were many 
elements in the other situations which, compared with the 
situation in arithmetic, invited either neatness or its oppo- 
site; but these other situations were not recognized by the 
children as inviting the same treatment as the arithmetic 
papers, and the mode of procedure, although it was possible, 
did not carry over inté the new situations. 
PoWER OF GENERALIZATION VERSUS IDENTICAL 
ELEMENTS 
In the same fashion we may show that the principles of 
intellectual economy which Thorndike frequently includes 
in his statement of indentical modes of procedure, namely, 
the principles that one can learn to avoid distractions of all 
sorts, or that he can refuse to give up a piece of work even 
when it is uncomfortable, represent generalized identities 
of procedure which are not always realized. In all these 
cases we must distinguish sharply between the possibility 
of identical modes of procedure and the actual achievement 
of this identity. Such an achievement depends upon the 
exercise of trained intelligence. The existence of possible 
modes of procedure does not lead inevitably to their real- 
ization in fact. 
Another illustration is of exactly the same type. A great 
deal of our reasoning involves the principle which has been 
clearly stated in the logics in the formula that every effect 
has its cause. Whoever becomes conscious of this general 
logical principle will find that in many different situations 
he depends upon this fundamental mode of explanation for 
 
-P-A-G-E-427
  GENERALIZED EXPERIENCE 417 
his scientific thinking. The little child undoubtedly is in- 
fluenced very early by his experience to look for some cause 
for every effect. For example, the little child who hears a 
noise always looks for the source of the noise. If he sees a 
missile flying toward him, he always looks for the source of 
the missile. Gradually he falls into the habit of looking for 
causes for all effects and for effects of all causes. He could’ 
not formulate the fundamental principle back of these expe- 
riences in any definite terms, but he undoubtedly does come 
to assume a general attitude which is the background for 
the later logical formula that all effects must have their 
causes. There is, indeed, an identical element of causal 
relation in every possible situation. In this sense of the 
word we might say that all thinking is absolutely bound 
together by the presence of an identical principle. The 
degree to which the student will become aware of this 
common principle in all thinking will differ according to 
his training. The little child looks for fantastic causes for 
effects which he observes, and we say of him that his power 
of causal reasoning is very immature. The savage, as we 
have seen in the discussion of scientific thinking, tries to 
invent explanations; but he indulges in very free and un- 
critical imaginations. It would be very difficult to relate 
his mode of thought to the causal principle of science. It 
would be interesting to inquire how far a savage’s mode of 
explanation of the physical facts about him is influenced 
by purely accidental elements, and how far by the demand 
for causal explanation which he possesses in common with 
all mankind. 
GENERALIZED MopEs or THOUGHT AND BEHAVIOR 
There are also certain identical elements of personality 
involved in every situation. When I view the world from 
my point of view, I import into every experience which I 
 
-P-A-G-E-428
418 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
pass through a certain mode of observation and a certain 
mode of thought which grow out of the totality of my earlier 
contact with the world. James has described this by saying 
that every human being is a bundle of personalities. At 
one moment one thinks of the world from the point of view 
of his business ; a little later he will look at the world from 
the point of view of his social engagements. In these two 
cases he will be dominated in his thought by the point of 
view which he is at that moment assuming. AI] business 
transactions are thought of in a world of experience which 
is made up of the sum total of the individual’s past contact 
with business affairs. We may say, therefore, that every 
individual brings to every new situation which he encoun- 
ters the identical sum of his past experiences. This sum of 
past experiences will from time to time undergo enlarge- 
ment and change because every new experience enters into 
the sum and contributes to a change in the individual’s per- 
sonality. There is, however, in a very proper sense of the 
word a nucleus of permanent experiences which must be 
reckoned with in any educational development. The child 
who has gone through the hands of a certain teacher carries 
away the stamp of that teacher’s training; and every other 
course which he takes up will bear the impression of this 
earlier training. There is not a school in the country that 
does not testify loudly to the fact that a bad teacher in one 
of the lower grades will leave so serious an impression upon 
the class that has gone through the hands of this teacher 
that later instructors will have difficulty in overcoming the 
bad effects. It is fortunately true, on the other side, that 
an excellent teacher leaves behind methods of work and 
ideas about work which are of very great advantage to the 
students in their later studies. 
 
-P-A-G-E-429
   GENERALIZED EXPERIENCE 419 
THe AvTHOR OF THE DOCTRINE OF IDENTICAL 
ELEMENTS FINDS IT INADEQUATE 
When one begins to define the identical elements of a 
situation in these broad general terms he sees that the for- 
mula, identical elements of experience, is absolutely worth- 
less. One is tempted to confirm this general position by 
quoting from Thorndike’s own mature conclusions! in the 
matter where he says: 
The general theory of identical elements — that one ability 
is improved by the exercise of another only when the neurones 
whose action the former represents are actually altered in the 
course of the exercise of the latter —is sound, and is useful 
in guiding thought. However, so little is known about which 
neurones are concerned in any ability that this general theory 
does not carry us far. 
On the other hand, one is convinced as he considers 
carefully this general doctrine of identical elements that 
one of the most important considerations in any system of 
training is to help students to discover the possibilities of 
generalization presented in successive situations. For exam- 
ple, mental economy is possible in a great variety of cases. 
Let us practice mental economy now under this set of con- 
ditions, and now under that. Again, the facts which are ac- 
cumulated in a course in physics are capable of being carried 
over into the world of mechanics and the world of practical 
affairs. Let us take these facts, therefore, and see how 
far they can be generalized and made useful in all of the 
different spheres of experience. The problem of education 
thus turns out to be the problem of generalizing experience.

-P-A-G-E-430
420 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
GENERALIZATION AN ACHIEVEMENT OF THE 
AcTIVE MIND 
There can be only one conclusion drawn from the fore- 
going discussions: There is no inherent reason in the 
psychology of the individual mind or in the psychology of 
any subject of instruction for supposing that experience 
cannot be generalized. On the other hand, there is no rea- 
son to assume that experience of any type will infallibly 
carry over into any other sphere whatsoever. The gener- 
alizing of experience is a qualitatively new fact wherever 
it appears. Given experience A and experience B, the 
transfer of effects from A to B is just as much a new psy- 
chological process where it occurs, as were A and B when 
they first appeared in experience. To think of A and B 
as related because they exist is to fail to understand 
the psychology of generalization. Everywhere in human 
experience there are large possibilities of generalizing ex- 
perience, and everywhere in school there is danger that 
experience will be narrowly specialized. 
FORMALISM MEANS AN ABSENCE OF GENERALIZATION 
This conclusion can be reénforced by studying what is 
really criticized when one uses the term “formal” as a term 
of condemnation in describing educational efforts. One goes 
back, for example, to the period of instruction in the classics 
when extreme formalism obtained in that study. What do 
we mean by the statement that extreme formalism appeared ? 
We mean merely that there was no possibility of utilizing 
the results of that classical study in the life of the student. 
The study was.a closed domain of experience, useful only in 
carrying the student around anarrow circle of exercises which 
terminated in more exercises of exactly the same sort and 
never stimulated thestudent to go out infurther investigation
-P-A-G-E-431
  GENERALIZED EXPERIENCE 421 
of the world. A subject which gets itself so organized that it 
rotates around its own center immediately becomes formal. 
Attention has been drawn to the fact in the discussion 
of manual training that even a course in handwork may 
become formal in the same extreme sense in which a course 
in the classics becomes formal. A course in mathematics 
may become formal or a course in science may become 
formal. There is nothing that is more stereotyped than a 
course in botany taught by an instructor who does not see 
the opportunity of generalizing the results of this science. 
Over against the formalism which is possible in every 
subject, there is the possibility of generalizing all sorts of 
training. We may express this in terms of an earlier dis- 
cussion by saying that every science and every subject 
taught in the schools may be made productive because of 
the higher forms of mental activity which are stimulated 
by the study itself. If one can have his interest in number 
enlarged by each progressive step of mathematical study, 
he will be carried forward in his mathematical studies in 
such a way that he will find new applications for the prin- 
ciples which he has learned. The opposite of formalism is 
not emphasis on content, but emphasis on application. Any 
content may become formal. Any mode of procedure may 
become formal. Opposed to “formal” is such a word as 
“vital.” That is not formal which moves forward to new 
applications. Generalized knowledge is not formal. Knowl- 
edge which is being used in applications, either in the 
evolution of higher thought-processes or in the solution 
of practical problems, is not formal. 
APPLICATION AS A FoRM OF Gunmratization 
The application of a body of information to a particular 
situation has sometimes been regarded as psychologically 
identical in character with the possession of this information.

  422 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
Thus, it has been assumed in much of our school practice 
that if a student knows the principles of mechanics he will 
be able to discover these principles in operation in the ordi- 
nary facts of everyday life. This expectation is, of course, 
not justified. The boy who learns physies in the laboratory 
goes out into the workshop and passes many practical situa- 
tions in which the results of his physics would be applicable, 
‘but fails utterly to recognize in these situations the physi- 
cal laws which he knows in an abstract way. The school 
has undoubtedly been remiss in its attention to the phase 
of mental life which we here call application. Application 
is, however, a most difficult mental process, and needs 
to be learned just as the original principle itself has to 
be learned. 
One of the methods by which one learns to apply experi- 
ence that he has acquired is by the careful analysis of a 
large number of situations, and by a statement in connection 
with this analysis of the fundamental,common principle 
which appears in all of the different situations. Thus, when 
we find the principle of gravity operating in one experiment 
in the physical laboratory, and then turn to a second and 
third experiment where the same principle is exhibited, we 
are preparing to isolate from these various different situa- 
tions the common facts of gravity. If the student can be 
interested in discovering this common principle in a great 
variety of situations, he will have a type of mental attitude 
which is different from that which he cultivates in merely 
contemplating a single fact. 
Successive examples, therefore, should be treated as the 
opportunity on the part of a teacher to cultivate the attitude 
of application. The cultivation of this attitude will be 
defeated if the instructor starts out with the explicit state- 
ment that each of the cases to be submitted contains the 
particular factor under discussion. Thus, if one gives fifty 
examples of the first law of mechanics, and explicitly states 
oe
-P-A-G-E-433
GENERALIZED EXPERIENCE 423 
at the outset that these fifty examples are all manifestations 
of that first law, he will not give his students the same 
degree of training that he would have given if he had mixed 
these examples with examples of the other laws of mechan- 
ics, and allowed the student to discover which of the laws 
of mechanics appears in each case. 
APPLICATION HAS MANy Forms 
In the same fashion, in algebra it is a fundamental mistake 
to give to students all of the examples under a given prin- 
ciple with a definite statement to the effect that all of these 
are examples of a single type. The student fails to get the 
mental training in this case which is desired. He merely 
cultivates a kind of dexterity of manipulation which is very 
far from a genuine application of a scientific principle. 
Students leave school without the ability to make applica- 
tions as a separate mode of mental activity. The teacher 
ought to recognize in all of these cases that the mere solu- 
tion of the problem is of slight importance if the student 
does not acquire that higher power of discovering the mode 
of procedure which is appropriate in each case. The solution 
of the problem is mere routine. The classification of the 
problem is a form of generalization. 
In the same way we may consider the possible extensions 
of any course of language study. If Latin is taught merely 
for the purpose of making it possible for the student to read 
some of the classical texts, the subject has a very narrow 
range of application. On the other hand, Latin may be 
taught with a view to stimulating students to consider the 
civilization which utilized this language; and still better, 
it may be taught in such a way that one comes back to a 
consideration of his mother tongue with the enriched expe- 
riences that he gains through his study. Finally, if the stu- 
dent not only realizes that Latin and his mother tongue have
-P-A-G-E-434
  424 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
certain common structures, but learns also that language in 
all of its development is an expression of a clear mode of 
thinking, and that he can become more lucid in his thought- 
processes by mastering this instrument of thought — then 
the applications of Latin become highly productive. 
GENERALIZATION THE HicgHEsT AIM OF INSTRUCTION 
Generalization of ideas and extension of any subject to 
its possible applications is, therefore, a larger and more sig- 
nificant aim in education than mere training in any given 
particular subject. Those who have opposed the doctrine 
of formal discipline by saying that the school subjects at 
the present time do not give a generalized training are un- 
doubtedly criticizing not the human mind, but our methods. 
of instruction. It is, indeed, possible to find courses in arith- 
metic and algebra which are so narrowing in their effect 
upon students’ minds that it is doubtful whether they ought 
to be included in the course of study at all. So long as 
narrow-minded teachers are put in charge of these courses, 
and especially if teachers become imbued with the idea that 
their only business is to cultivate a narrow and limited fune- 
tion of mind, we shall have examples of these pedagogical 
failures which in the statistics shdw that training has not 
been transferred. 
On the other hand, there has been a very large body 
of experience which makes for the conclusion that any sub- 
ject properly taught has a broadening influence upon the 
student’s general experience. {The older subjects of the 
curriculum have so long served the purposes of instruction 
that they have cultivated a form of treatment and body 
of material which generation after generation has come to 
appreciate as a suitable vehicle for the general training of the 
mind. These older subjects have a distinct advantage over 
the newer subjects, which are still trying out the subject
-P-A-G-E-435
     
GENERALIZED EXPERIENCE 425 
matter which they utilize and the methods of presenting 
this subject matter. Until the newer subjects have mastered 
the problem of selecting material they will never be equal 
to the older subjects which have been worked out by gen- 
erations of teachers. It is always safe to assume that the 
older subjects have more possibility of successful employ- 
ment in the school for any purpose of education than have 
the new and untried subjects, the contents of which have 
not been worked over by experienced teachers. That the 
newer subjects should be able to impeach the older subjects 
of frequently lapsing into formalism is not to be wondered 
at, because it is certain on the simplest calculation of chances 
that the older subjects which have been widely utilized in 
the schools will exhibit more pedagogical failures than the 
newer subjects which have not yet been tried out. But 
there is no adequate justification for the loud contention of 
the newer subjects that the older subjects of the curriculum 
are inherently formal and of necessity narrow in the effects 
which they produce on students’ minds. 
GENERALIZATION APPEARS IN MANy Forms 
There is one further psychological discussion which is 
important in concluding this treatment of formal discipline. 
Bagley! and a number of other writers have contended 
that the transfer of training always depends upon the con- 
scious recognition by students of the possibilities of carrying 
over an ideal from one course to another. The statement 
that a generalization must come to explicit recognition goes 
too far. A study of the facts of mental development 
reveals many different forms and stages of the process of 
generalization. For example, the student who discovers a

1905); also E. N. Henderson, Textbook in the Principles of Education, 
p. 213 (The Macmillan Company, 1910).

  426 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
general principle in physics may get his principle in one of 
two ways: he may either have the principle presented to 
him in a definite and conscious form, after which he seeks 
illustrations of the principle in various facts which he en- 
counters. This is commonly known as a deductive method 
of teaching. Or, on the other hand, the student may equally 
well be brought to the general principle through contact 
with a number of concrete cases. He now sees this case 
and now another. He learns to adjust himself in each of 
the particular cases without making at the outset any 
complete analysis of his experience. 
PRACTICAL JUDGMENT AS AN EARLY ForM OF 
GENERALIZATION 
Hobhouse! has described in his discussion of practical 
judgment the stage of mental development which precedes 
the full development of conscious principles. Practical 
judgment for Hobhouse is a mode of generalization in which 
the individual becomes aware of certain aspects of the 
world without making a complete conscious analysis of his 
different experiences. As a result of practical comparisons 
one carries over modes of behavior from situation to situa- 
tion. This carrying over of experiences without complete 
analysis appears in a large way in all the minor adjustments 
of life. In social matters, for example, having cultivated a 
certain attitude toward a given individual, one is likely to 
behave in the same general way to everybody who vaguely 
reminds one of the original person for whom the mode of 
behavior was cultivated. One becomes in the course of 
time suddenly aware of the reason why he behaves toward 
his new acquaintance as he does. The reason is that this 
new acquaintance resembles in some general way people 
who have in earlier experiences been the subjects of certain 
1L.T. Hobhouse, Mind in Evolution. The Macmillan Company, 1902,
-P-A-G-E-437
     GENERALIZED EXPERIENCE 427 
types of behavior. If now we can bring the individual to 
the level of clear conscious analysis, we very frequently see 
that the rough analogies on which we have been depend- 
ing are wholly inadequate; that is, the individual whom 
I have been treating in an agreeable way because he re- 
sembled a friend may turn out to be an individual wholly 
undeserving of this attention on my part. The conscious 
ideal or the complete-analysis of the situation then inter- 
rupts a mode of adjustment which has been going on in a 
general way without any clear knowledge on my part of 
the reasons for this mode of adjustment. Conversely, if I 
have been treating a person badly because he looks like one 
of my enemies, I may on discovering the real reason of my 
attitude suddenly find that I ought to revise this attitude. 
The earlier stages of such situations can be described as 
stages of practical judgment of a rather crude and indefinite 
sort. To say that all transfer of attitudes depends upon 
clear and conscious ideals is to fail to recognize these early 
stages of practical judgment. It would be more in keeping 
with the facts to say that we rely on all sorts of practical 
judgments until some failure makes us aware of the inade- 
quacy of our vague generalizations. Then we cultivate a 
higher form of generalization. 
LANGUAGE AN INSTRUMENT OF GENERALIZATION 
The discussion of generalization in the chapter on science 
brought out the fact that in many cases generalization is 
dependent on the use of words. There can be no doubt 
that this fact was one of the chief considerations which led 
Bagley to his doctrine of transfer through conscious ideals. 
When a child is led to see, through the use of words, that 
various situations are all capable of one identical treatment, 
he discovers what he would otherwise overlook, and gener- 
alization is greatly aided.
-P-A-G-E-438
  428 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
On the other hand, as has been pointed out repeatedly dn 
all the discussions of language, the student may be led away 
from true generalizations into mere substitutes for general- 
izations by words. This is the reason why ideals which are 
expressed in words are often very formal in character. One 
may tell a student, for example, that he ought to concen- 
trate his attention, and he may have the theoretical ideal 
of concentration well in mind and yet be quite unable in 
practice to realize the advantages of this ideal. What is 
needed in this case is a real generalization or a translation 
of his verbally recognized principle into an actual mode of 
behavior. This translation into an actual mode of behavior 
very frequently differs so radically from the recognition of 
the verbal statement of the principle that the student may be 
fully aware of the principle in one form but altogether un- 
acquainted with it in the other. Even then the verbal prin- 
ciple may be a useful means of education. Thus, when one 
is told to concentrate his attention he will try first by one 
method and then by another. He will withdraw himself 
from all sorts of distractions. He will read out loud in order 
to facilitate the concentration of attention. He will wrinkle 
his forehead as Fechner indicated that he always did when 
he was trying to concentrate attention. He will sometimes 
adopt devices that seem to an onlooker to promote distrac- 
tion rather than concentration, such as beating a rhythm 
with his fingers on the desk, or whistling, or stamping his 
feet. These different devices adopted by the student who 
is trying to concentrate his attention are very difficult to 
relate to the general verbal formula, and yet the steady 
holding of the verbal formula before one’s mind may lead 
one to try a great variety of experiments in the concentra- 
tion of attention. Ultimately these experiments may result 
in the adoption of some practical mode of procedure which 
will satisfy the formula with which one started. The ver- 
bal formula in this case is not to be regarded as the actual
-P-A-G-E-439
  GENERALIZED EXPERIENCE 429 
habit to which it relates, but it is a kind of stimulus or a 
kind of reminder that one ought to seek continually some 
habit of concentration. To say that the transfer has taken 
place in this case through a conscious ideal is to fail to 
recognize the fact that the value of the verbal formula is 
that it is of such a general type that it can stimulate in a 
great many different cases the development of a great many 
different kinds of detailed procedure. Thus the concentra- 
tion of attention when one is reading may be wholly differ- 
ent from the concentration of attention when one is listening 
to music or to a lecture; and yet the effort to concentrate 
attention in these different cases may be promoted by the 
presence in the mind of the student of the verbal formula 
that he must pay as close attention as he can. 
LANGUAGE ITSELF A GENERALIZED MODE OF BEHAVIOR 
In general, as has been pointed out in earlier discussions, 
language is a general mode of behavior capable of connect- 
ing itself with all sorts of particular habits. It is a kind of 
generalized sphere of action, and as such a general sphere 
of action it becomes an influential element in all sorts of sit- 
uations. It is indeed a common element of all of these dif- 
ferent situations, but it is a common element in the sense 
that it is a higher type of adjustment than any particular 
mode of procedure. As such a higher type of procedure, it 
reaches down into a variety of concrete situations. Its value 
arises from the fact that it is a general mode of behavior. 
Emotion A Form or GENERAL BEHAVIOR 
There are other general modes of behavior besides lan- 
guage. For example, one of these general modes of behavior 
which is of a good deal of importance is the emotional re- 
action of the individual. We speak in ordinary life of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-440
480 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
optimistic attitude of an individual, and we have every 
evidence that the optimistic attitude is a favorable attitude 
in whatever particular line of accomplishment the individ- 
ual expresses himself. A person who is constantly opti- 
mistic will undertake all sorts of enterprises in a spirit 
of energy and enthusiasm which is wholly different from 
that exhibited by a pessimistic individual. There can be 
no doubt that the skillful teacher should be interested in 
the cultivation of such favorable general attitudes. The 
failure of teachers to appreciate the value of optimism 
appears at times in the fact that they correct the student 
so frequently in classes as to develop an expectation on his 
part that he is going to fail in everything that he tries to 
do. The withdrawals from school which are so characteris- 
tic of the earlier years of the high school are connected in 
no small measure with the unfavorable emotional attitude 
aroused in the class exercises. 
These general emotional attitudes may attach themselves 
to all sorts of particular situations. Thus, one may be opti- 
mistic about getting a Latin lesson or he may be optimistic 
about a game of football. He may be optimistic about a 
business venture or he may be optimistic about the move- 
ments of his political party. In any case he will react in 
each of these situations with a general organic vigor which 
is represented in his own experience by the pleasure that 
attaches to his reaction. It cannot be stated that the emo- 
tional reactions in the various manifestations of optimism 
are identical in detail, because all of our psychological an- 
alyses go to show that the pleasure which comes from the 
solution of a problem of an intellectual type is different 
from the pleasure which comes from physical exercise. Yet 
the two are of the same general type; and both represent a 
kind of organic vigor and a mode of organic reaction which 
becomes typical of the individual and characteristic of all 
his behavior. This kind of example serves also to reérforce 
 
-P-A-G-E-441
     
GENERALIZED EXPERIENCE © 431 
what was said a few paragraphs above with regard to the 
importance of personality as the central element in all sorts 
of situations. There is nothing more typical of one’s per- 
sonality than his emotional moods and his general reactions 
of optimism or pessimism. 
INTELLECTUAL METHODS WHICH ARE GENERALIZED 
Further_examples_of general reactions will be discovered 
if we analyze the typical school situations in which an 
effort is made to cultivate general habits. Take, for ex- 
ample, the series of exercises which are used in the algebra 
class to make a student thoroughly familiar with a given 
principle of factoring or a given mode of procedure in mul- 
tiplication or division.One may say that the various exer- 
cises which the student works out are intended to acquaint 
him with the same mode of procedure as it appears in a 
variety of different connections. He uses a certain prin- 
ciple of factoring now in one situation and now in another, 
or he uses the process of multiplication now with one com- 
bination of letters and now with another. The common 
fact in each of these different situations is the mathemati- 
cal process as distinguished from the actual recombination 
of the particular elements that enter into the special exer- 
cise. From the point of view of the mathematician, there 
is a common element in all of these situations; but that 
common element is a general principle, which general prin- 
ciple and general mode of procedure must be discovered 
after one has solved a number of the particular situations 
in which the general mode of procedure occurs. The gen- 
eral principle to be comprehended is not a part of each one 
of the situations. It is the product in the individual’s mind 
of a comparison of all these different particular cases. It 
cannot be said that the general mode of procedure appears 
in case one and case two and case three, or that it is
-P-A-G-E-442
  432 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
something which can be detached from each of these cases 
and looked at as a common element. The general principle 
arises from the comparison of case one with case two and 
case three. The power of making this comparison and of 
arriving at a general mode of procedure is a higher power 
than the power of solving the particular problem. This 
fact, that the recognition of the general principle is a higher 
type of power than that which is involved in the solution 
of particular problems, appears again and again in the train- 
ing of students. There are many students who know how 
to solve a problem if they are told which process to employ, 
but they do not know enough about the problem to select 
the process which is appropriate to the situation in hand. 
The mastery of the general principle is therefore a new 
type of mental achievement. 
In the same way the student discovers a general prin- 
ciple of language structure when he learns, for example, 
that all nominative cases have certain characteristics. He 
is not merely taking an element that appears in one ex- 
ample of the nominative case, and in the second example 
the same sort, and so on, recognizing an element common 
to all of these different situations; he is learning rather 
to extract from a variety of experiences a general principle 
or rule. The discovery of this general principle or rule is 
a new performance; it is an expression of the power of 
generalization. The cultivation of this power of general- 
ization is the most important achievement in the student’s 
education. It will not come without special endeavor on 
the part of the student and on the part of the teacher. 
METHODS OF INDUCING GENERALIZATION 
The same conclusion is reached if we examine some of 
the practical methods which are adopted in school work to in- 
duce students to generalize their experiences. Undoubtedly
-P-A-G-E-443
   GENERALIZED EXPERIENCE 433 
one of the most advantageous methods that can be em- 
ployed is to give students a verbal statement or conscious 
ideal as Bagley suggests. A verbal formula which will 
stimulate a student to strive on various occasions for con- 
centration of attention is a suitable instrument for the 
teacher to employ in developing concentration. On the 
other hand, the teacher knows full well that the mere 
presentation of this verbal formula is not enough; conse- 
quently he devises situations which he presents to the 
student with a view to furnishing him the opportunity of 
applying his verbal formula and making generalizations. 
These situations ought to be organized in such a way that 
it will be relatively easy for the student to make a general- 
ization. Sometimes the generalization can be reached by 
the comparisons of a number of cases. Every teacher is 
aware of the value of a comparison as a means of training 
the student to arrive at generalizations of his own. For 
example, if one wishes to get the general meaning of a 
foreign word clearly in the mind of a student it is always 
advantageous to compare the word with certain synonyms. 
The purpose of this comparison is not to bring out an iden- 
tical element which appears in all cases. Very frequently 
the purpose of comparison is to bring out unlike elements. 
In the same way, if one is working on the scientific descrip- 
tion of an animal in zodlogy or a plant in botany the most 
impressive lesson can be derived from comparison and con- 
trast. The use of the terms “comparison” and “ contrast” 
shows that generalizations very often deal with something 
besides common elements in different situations. There are 
discoverable relationships in all of the different situations, 
but the discovery of a relationship which can be regarded 
as a general element of a variety of different situations is 
a new achievement. Suppose, for example, that one wishes 
to show that the structure of an animal that lives in water 
is very different from the structure of an animal that lives
-P-A-G-E-444
  434 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
in the air. The contrast between the two cases will lead 
directly to generalizations about relations of function to 
structure which could not be secured if all of the animals 
were of a single type. In the same way, in discussing 
geometry it has been found advantageous to contrast the 
space which we know with such hypothetical space as the 
non-Euclidean geometricians devise for the purely theo- 
retical purposes of contrast. Here the mind creates a sit- 
uation for the purpose of aiding contrast rather than for 
the purpose of discovering similarity of elements. As was 
pointed out in the discussion of the study of foreign lan- 
guages one of the most useful functions of this study is to 
supply a student with a background for the application of 
his mother tongue. 
ATTENTION TO GENERALIZATIONS A PRODUCT OF 
INsTRUCTION 
There can be no doubt that all the efforts of the school 
to induce generalization lead to an attitude of mind which 
can be described as the generalizing attitude. Wherever a 
student has seen the possibility of analyzing various situa- 
tions and discovering productive relationships between these 
different particular situations, he will be stimulated to treat 
new problems in the same way. He will see the possibility 
of analyzing everything that comes into his experience for 
the purpose of discovering general principles. We have 
here a broad habit of mind which is undoubtedly very 
largely promoted through the use of language as a general- 
ized mode of reaction upon all situations. The habit of 
verbal analysis is a general habit dominating all of the de- 
tailed habits of mental life. In our discussion of scientific 
method we have pointed out the fact that there is such a 
generalized habit of scientific analysis which can be culti- 
vated through the study of all of the sciences. The only
-P-A-G-E-445
  
   GENERALIZED EXPERIENCE 435 
additional remark which needs to be made at this point is 
that the teacher must explicitly cultivate this general habit. 
FAREWELL TO Critics OF FoRMAL DISCIPLINE 
In conclusion, we may be permitted to set the teachings 
of this chapter in as sharp contrast as possible with the posi- 
tion taken by those who teach a doctrine of specialized men- 
tal functions. This chapter is intended to teach a doctrine 
which is diametrically opposed to the following principle 
announced in 1905 by Thorndike in his “ Principles of 
Teaching,” p. 248: 
Training the mind means the development of thousands of 
particular independent capacities, the formation of countless 
particular habits, for the working of any mental capacity de- 
pends upon the concrete data with which it works. 
Or, putting the matter in another way, this chapter is 
intended to prevent the violent oscillations described by 
Thorndike in his “ Educational Psychology,” published in 
1913 (Vol. II, pp. 364-365) : 
The notions of mental machinery which, being improved for 
one sort of data, held the improvement equally for all sorts; 
of magic powers which, being trained by exercise of one sort 
to a high efficiency, held that efficiency whatever they might 
be exercised upon; and of the mind as a reservoir for potential 
energy which could be filled by any one activity and drawn on 
for any other — have now disappeared from expert writings 
on psychology. A survey of experimental results is now needed. 
perhaps as much to prevent the opposite superstition; for, 
apparently, some careless thinkers have rushed from the belief 
in totally general training to the belief that training is totally 
specialized. In any case, such a survey is the safest prepara- 
tion for deciding theoretical or practical questions concerning 
the effect of the improvement of any one function, in school 
or out, upon the efficiency of other functions.

  CHAPTER XVIII 
TEACHING STUDENTS TO STUDY 
TEACHERS NOT EQUIPPED WITH METHOD OF TRAINING 
STUDENTS TO STUDY 
The theme of this chapter can be illustrated by an ex- 
ample given the writer by a high-school principal who is 
much concerned with the problem of teaching students how 
to do their school work efficiently. He has so organized his 
school that one period a day is set aside for consultation be- 
tween each teacher and some class. During the last period 
of the day on every Monday the teachers meet the classes 
which in the daily program recite during the first period of 
the day; on Tuesdays, during the last period, classes go 
to the teachers who have charge of their recitations during 
the second period of the day; and so on. When the teacher 
and the class meet in this additional period, it is not for 
the purpose of an additional recitation ; the purpose of this 
period is to direct students in the methods of getting their 
lessons efficiently and economically. The program above 
described was arranged and the classes met the teachers. 
Then it was discovered that the teachers did not know 
what to say to the students. Teachers know about Latin 
and mathematics. They can ask questions in these subjects ; 
but they do not know about students’ minds in a way which 
makes it possible to tell students how to study. 
One becomes most acutely aware of the problem of 
method of study when a student is in difficulty. How shall 
we help him out of his difficulty ? Yet the more important 
problem is to make increasingly efficient those students 
436
-P-A-G-E-447
  
TEACHING STUDENTS TO STUDY 437 
who are not in difficulty. Most teachers do not realize that 
good students need help in methods of work. The result 
is that a teacher confronted with a class which he has met 
that morning in a Latin recitation, and told that his duty in 
this second period is to teach not Latin but the methods 
of study, stands dumb and embarrassed. If someone fails 
in a Latin construction, this teacher can tell him the cor- 
rect construction. If someone uses a clumsy Latin phrase, 
the teacher knows Latin enough to suggest improvement. 
When it comes to improving mental processes, how differ- 
ent the case! The teacher has little training. 
PsycHoLocy As ScreENcE oF MrtHops or Stupy 
This is the point at which the student of psychology finds 
his opportunity to review what he has to say in his discus- 
sion of the psychology of the various subjects. The psychol- 
ogist deals in mental processes and difficulties. He knows 
neither Latin nor mathematics except as content for mental 
processes. He is therefore eager to impress on the Latin 
teacher and the teacher of mathematics the desirability of 
becommg psychologists as well. The following pages will 
be devoted to the effort to set forth in a concrete way the 
kind of considerations which a teacher might take up with 
a class which he meets for the purpose of discussing the 
problem of how to study. Some of the illustrations will be 
drawn from the earlier chapters of this book, some from 
classroom experiences. 
PsycHoLoGy oF DIFFERENT TyPEs of STUDY 
First, attention may be called to the fact that a sharp 
contrast can be drawn between studying by one’s self with 
the aid of a book and studying with the codperation of 
others, as, for example, when a class as a whole reads a book 
 
-P-A-G-E-448
  438 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
and considers its contents in conference. The student who 
sits down alone with a book does not have in his own per- 
sonal experiences the same number of questions about the 
meaning of the text or the same number of ideas growing 
out of his reading of the text as would a group of people. 
While one individual reading a book sees in the text diffi- 
culties or suggestions, two individuals will have, possibly, 
not twice as many questions and suggestions, but certainly 
more than the single individual would have. Therefore, 
when two people read a book together they may help each 
other by raising questions which represent two different 
individual points of view. It would be very valuable for 
someone to set the same lesson to be studied, first by a 
class that took it for home work, and, second, by:a class 
that read the same book over with the teacher and with the 
other members of the class. Aftér these two different types 
of study, an investigation might be made of the differences 
between the points of view cultivated and the completeness 
with which the information was criticized. 
The foregoing paragraph also suggests that different 
kinds of subjects need to be approached in different ways. 
For example, it might be very profitable to study a history 
lesson or a geography lesson with the class as a whole; on 
the other hand, the study of a lesson in spelling might better 
be undertaken by the individual without the codperation 
of the class. Or perhaps the last example should be modi- 
fied so as to call attention to the fact that if the class as a 
whole studies the spelling lesson the method of procedure 
will be one of discussion of the different words rather than 
a concentration on the individual words, whereas if the 
student studies the words by himself he is likely to give 
himself up to the exact memorizing of the words rather 
than to their discussion.

TEACHING STUDENTS TO STUDY 439 
Rapip SURVEY 
A second general topic which it is important to discuss 
is the distinction between a careful analytical study of a 
subject and the development of a general point of view by 
rapidly reading over a body of material. For example, the 
student who is given a passage in history to learn may 
advantageously read the whole section that has been as- 
signed to him at a single sitting, for the purpose of gaining 
a general view of the subject, and then he may come back 
to the detailed examination of the particular incidents that 
enter into the full description. Evidently a general reading 
of an arithmetic lesson or a lesson in algebra would be less 
productive. In some cases, however, a general reading of 
the whole lesson might be advantageous even when the 
lesson is of the type that one finds in algebra; but here 
the successive stages of any topic depend so much upon a 
clear comprehension of everything that has gone before that 
it is probably not desirable for the student to emphasize 
the whole until he has mastered the successive steps of the 
reasoning. 
Undoubtedly the attitude of a minute study of each 
individual sentence is sometimes carried to an extreme. 
The student puzzles over the exact meaning of a certain 
sentence when the exact meaning cannot be understood 
except in the light of fuller exposition which follows later 
in the paragraph. This puzzling over a single sentence con- 
sumes much time, and leads to a mental habit of distracted 
thinking which is opposed to the interests of rapid assim- 
ilation of large bodies of material. The student should be 
trained both in careful analytical study and in general 
study of whole passages, but the two types of training 
should not come at the same time. 
The rate at which a student assimilates material is a 
matter of importance. It is not desirable that he should be
-P-A-G-E-450
  440 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
hurried in his mental processes, otherwise he is likely to 
become confused. If he is told that he must get a thing 
done in a limited space of time, this very requirement is 
itself a subject of attention. The student is constantly dis- 
tracted by looking forward to the end of the lesson, and is 
therefore unable to take the successive steps of the reason- 
ing without distraction. On the other hand, it is a mistake 
to allow a student to develop habits of excessively slow 
reasoning and slow study. He should be encouraged to 
work, while he works, at a maximum rate. One of the sim- 
plest ways of securing this maximum rate of study is to 
give explicit training in the mastery of short sections of a 
subject where the confusion from the demand to work 
rapidly will not be great. Let the teacher set, under his 
own guidance and supervision, a short paragraph and ask 
the student to get it as soon as possible. The task of con- 
centrating attention at a high level for a brief period of time 
does not make an excessive demand on the student’s powers; 
and if he finds that he can do this for short sections, the 
sections may gradually be increased in length. 
OxssERVING MertHops or StuDY 
One of the best opportunities for observing the way in 
which students do their work is in the study period. If the 
teacher will acquaint himself with the sections in the book 
which the student is supposed to be studying and will form 
a rough, general estimate of the length of time that is 
necessary for the reading of a page of printed matter, he 
may then watch the student and see whether he is reading at 
a reasonable rate. Very frequently it will be observed that 
the reader turns away from the book and looks out of the 
window or does something else, indicating that he is dis- 
tracted from the reading itself. Sometimes this turning 
away from the book indicates a genuine thought-process.
-P-A-G-E-451
  TEACHING STUDENTS TO STUDY 441 
The reader gets an idea from the passage and stops to 
consider the value of the idea. In general, in an immature 
reader this is not a fact. The turning away from the book 
is an indication of an interruption rather than of the 
working out of an idea. 
Careful observation of different individual students will 
undoubtedly bring out the fact that some students are able 
to concentrate for a longer period of time and to do their 
work at a higher rate of speed. If the teacher can learn to 
discriminate in this way between the different members of 
the class, he or she can later concentrate attention upon 
those who do not know how to stick to the problem. Here 
again the best method is to help them to concentrate 
attention on short passages. 
The mere social desire to get things done as rapidly as 
somebody else can be used in this connection. Certainly 
there are some subjects where social emulation can very 
properly be employed. Thus, in simple mathematical exer- 
cises it is proper to get up speed by competition. This speed 
should not be cultivated in such a way as to excite students 
too much. There is danger, if a speed exercise is continued 
for ten minutes, that the excitement will become too intense. 
On the other hand, a little excitement for a short period, 
say through a five-minute exercise, is entirely legitimate 
and desirable. In the same way, speed exercises in silent 
reading are entirely legitimate and should be undertaken 
from time to time. The habit of oral reading, and reading 
at the rate of oral reading, should be corrected by giving 
definite exercises in rapid silent reading. 
ASKING QUESTIONS OF PEOPLE AND OF Books 
Another important problem in learning how to study is 
to learn how to get information from books. The student 
should have the matter explained to him in some such
-P-A-G-E-452
  442 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
terms as these: If one needs information and goes to some 
other person and asks for it, he can keep on asking the 
person questions until a method of answering is adopted 
which the questioner can understand. On the other hand, 
if one goes to a book and insists on getting the information 
in just the form in which the question is present in one’s 
mind, he is not likely to find the exact answer to his ques- 
tion in the book. The way in which one has to get infor- 
mation out of the book is to learn to use the book in its 
own way. Perhaps the information which one wants is 
scattered over three or four pages. Possibly it is to be 
found only by consulting two or three different books. 
Asking questions of books, therefore, consists in getting 
one’s self trained so that he can get from the books what 
he wants by looking at the different places in the book 
where the different parts of his information are to be found. 
Very frequently one has to read in the book many things 
that he does not need for the answering of his question. 
In this respect looking in a book is not altogether different 
from asking a person questions. One very frequently gets 
more information than he needs when he asks a question. 
The one who answers starts out to give the answer, but he 
includes several other things. The listener must learn to 
make a selection from among the things he hears if he is to 
concentrate his attention on the particular items wanted. 
In like fashion, if one consults a book with a question in his 
mind, the answer which he seeks must be secured through 
a careful, selective reading just as in the case of personal 
inquiry; but here, in addition to selecting from an over- 
supply of information, one must know the technique of 
going through the book. Getting answers to a question is 
in any case different from the process of merely learning 
straight ahead what is in the book or what is given to one 
by someone else’s dictation. When one reads straight 
ahead in a book and gets the information that is there 
 
-P-A-G-E-453
        TEACHING STUDENTS TO STUDY 443 
presented, he follows the lead of someone else. He tries 
to formulate his thinking along lines laid down in the book. 
The difficulty with this process of simply following some- 
one else’s lead is that very shortly one comes on a sentence 
or a statement which he does not understand. He is then 
obliged to ask some sort of a question in order to clear up 
the difficulty. If he does not know how to ask that ques- 
tion, or if he is not alert enough to see that failure to under- 
stand the passage ought to lead him to ask a question, 
he becomes confused and unable to go on with his work. 
Students are often confronted by difficult passages, and 
they do not know what to do with them simply because 
they have not been trained in the course of their earlier 
work to ask questions about difficulties and to find answers 
to these questions. It is highly important, therefore, that 
students should be trained to ask questions and get answers. 
FoRMULATING PRODUCTIVE Q UESTIONS 
One important part of instruction in any course should 
accordingly be to get the students to raise questions about 
the subject under discussion. It would be an excellent prac- 
tice to require the class to formulate questions about each 
lesson. Some of these the teacher could answer directly, 
thus exhibiting the importance of social relations and social 
methods of getting information. Some of the questions 
should not be answered by the teacher, but should be given 
back to the class as problems to be solved. 
Assuming that a question has, in some fashion, been 
raised either by the teacher or by some member of the class 
who encounters a difficulty which he does not readily over- 
come, there should now be a careful consideration of the 
methods of getting answers to this question. The first and 
readiest method has already been suggested. Let someone 
who has the information in his mind and sees the point of   
-P-A-G-E-454
  444 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
the question give an answer. Very frequently an answer 
will be given which does not entirely cover the question. 
It is interesting, then, to subdivide the question to show 
that the answer given is a partial answer. Finally, the class 
will be brought to the point where no one has exactly the 
information that is needed to answer a part of the question 
that has been asked. One must now turn to the more 
elaborate authorities for this answer. The methods of turn- 
ing to these authorities should be taught. The teacher 
can very frequently give the necessary method by teaching 
students to turn to other parts of the textbook which they 
have in hand. Thus a student who is in difficulty with a 
problem in algebra ought to be taught how to turn back 
to the early parts of the book and get the answer to his 
difficulty. Turning back to the earlier parts of a book may 
involve turning to the table of contents. Another way of 
turning back to the earlier parts of the book is to look over 
rapidly all of the matter which is contained in the first part 
of the book. Students should be shown that it is not diffi- 
cult to run through fifty or sixty pages of a book in looking 
for an explanation of a difficulty which is encountered in 
the latter part of the book. Indeed, one ought to get into 
the habit of looking through all sorts of books and getting 
a general impression of what a book contains even before 
one studies the details of the book. 
THE DiscovERY OF PROBLEMS 
The foregoing paragraph suggests a most important phase 
of the studying process. Students should realize that one 
of the important interests in mental life is the discovery of 
problems, not merely the acceptance of answers to these 
problems. Wherever there is a deficiency in the information 
which the student has, he ought to be aware of that defi- 
ciency just as much as of the positive information which 
 
-P-A-G-E-455
     
TEACHING STUDENTS TO STUDY 445 
he gets. For example, if a student is reading in a history 
lesson and comes to the fact that while the United States 
was passing through a certain series of events England 
made such and such a representation to our government, 
the question ought instantly to arise in his mind, Why was 
England interested in making this representation? This 
question, in turn, should raise in the student’s mind the 
general question, What was going on in England at the 
same time? Very frequently our histories are one-sided 
because the students do not go beyond the statements in 
the text itself. They do not realize that these statements 
are only a part of the whole story of the world’s doings at 
that time. Ability to formulate this additional question and, 
in consequence, to see that one needs fuller information is 
the best possible training. There is nothing so disastrous 
in intellectual life as the attitude that one has all the in- 
formation which he needs. As pointed out in an earlier 
chapter the scientific method has, as one of its most impor- 
tant elements, the habit of problem raising and problem 
stating. When the chemist realizes that there is something 
which he does not know, but which he must find out in 
order to apply his chemistry to industry or to later develop- 
ments of the science itself, he has raised a question which 
makes possible fuller investigations. 
PROBLEMS DO NOT ARISE; THEY ARE DISCOVERED 
It has been one of the favorite themes of recent educa- 
tional writers to point out that problems are constantly 
arising in shop work and in industrial life. There is a cer- 
tain fallacy in this statement. It is true that shop work 
presents the possibility of certain problems. It is true also 
that. in industry certain problems naturally arise, but it is 
equally true, as has been pointed out in an earlier-chapter, 
that in industry only the leaders recognize these problems.
-P-A-G-E-456
  446 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
The ordinary workman does not see the direction in which 
his work can be improved. He goes on in the regular 
routine, following the example of his predecessors without 
question and without ingenuity to make a change. As soon 
as one sees the possibility of looking into every industrial 
process and asking whether it is as efficient as it might be, 
he starts on a new line of development. This new line of 
development is of first-class importance to industry, because 
it means that the attention of the man who has raised the 
question will be directed toward new answers to the problem 
that has always existed. 
Exactly the same statement can be made about school 
work. We go on studying texts that do not answer all 
possible questions on the subject, simply because our mental 
habits have been chiefly the habits of accepting and follow- 
ing someone else’s lead. Students are, in general, domi- 
nated by their teachers and by their textbooks, because these 
contain a great deal more information than the student can 
compass. The student is carried forward in the new fields of 
authority so rapidly that he is not stimulated to ask ques- 
tions. He is too busy trying to keep up with the questions 
that are asked by his teachers. It would be very much 
better if we could lead him to see new questions. The 
probabilities are that he will not ask questions even in his 
shop work any more than the practical worker asks these 
questions in the ordinary course of industry. Anyone who 
has seen shop work in the schools realizes that it does not 
satisfy the expectations of those who hold that shop work 
stimulates originality and creates a need for scientific study 
on the part of children. The fact is that our educational 
method must be modified, with the explicit view of giving 
children an opportunity to create intellectual needs through 
the questions which they raise. It has long been recognized 
in our description of children’s mental processes that they 
begin their school life with a natural feeling of these needs.
-P-A-G-E-457
TEACHING STUDENTS TO STUDY 447 
They ask questions with a good deal of freedom. The 
difficulty is that we do not know how to conserve that side 
of the child’s natural mental attitude. We answer these 
questions in such a way as to seem to give a final answer 
to the child’s needs, and we do not lead him to be keen 
about other possible questions of a higher order. 
THE ADVANTAGES OF GROUP STUDY 
One of the best ways to correct this difficulty is to allow 
a group of students to study a lesson together as indicated 
in an earlier paragraph. They will then stimulate each 
other to recognize difficulties and questions. If the lesson 
is recognized by the teacher and the class as a study les- 
son rather than as a recitation, the students can be made 
aware of methods that they ought to adopt in private 
study. The teacher who exhibits skill in this kind of an 
exercise has done much more for students than merely to 
train the memory. 
There is no doubt at all that we are confronted here with 
one of the greatest educational problems — the problem of 
cultivating the intellectual initiative which is necessary to 
raise questions, as the first step toward training students 
in the methods of getting answers to their own questions 
by the long and difficult methods of self-directed study. In 
the higher institutions of learning we call this intellectual 
initiative “research.” In the lower institutions we should 
describe it by saying that the student ought to learn first 
why he is expected to go to the library or to the laboratory 
orto the shop, or to some other source of information, and 
get a reply to his question. The value of an inquiry is very 
often in the appreciation which it brings of the problem 
solved. Thus the sixth-grade class which, in the study of 
geography, is led to see the possibility of observing the 
position of the sun in successive months is getting training 
 
-P-A-G-E-458
  448 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
in scientific research which is of first-class importance. 
Such investigation through direct scientific experiments is 
often by no means the most economical method of getting 
an answer, though it is often the most vivid way of teach- 
ing both the question and the answer. What the student 
often learns most impressively from an experiment is that 
others have seen this problem before he saw it. He will 
then appreciate more fully the fact that they worked on it 
and solved it. He will thus be led to recognize more fully 
the significance of his ability to read, and by reading secure 
the help of others who have made scientific investigations. 
One notices in his contact with teachers that there is 
in some quarters great respect for books, while in other 
quarters, books are regarded as of doubtful value. Some 
people are so absorbed in their ambitions to secure scien- 
tifie work from the children that they regard it, on the 
whole, as very damaging to children that they should be 
brought in contact with books. The better attitude in 
these matters is for the teacher to recognize that there are 
several different methods of getting solutions to questions. 
The book method of getting a solution is a complex method 
which gives mental training, but it is a different method 
from that which the scientific investigator follows when he 
gets a solution through experimentation. Social discussion 
is still another method which can be employed. Whichever 
method is being used, the student should be trained not 
only to master this or that mode of procedure for getting 
his answers but, above all, to know how to formulate ques- 
tions, and then to recognize the use of each of the methods 
of getting answers and the legitimacy now of one method 
and now of another.
-P-A-G-E-459
  TEACHING STUDENTS TO STUDY 449 
TRAINING IN EconomicAL METHops or Stupy 
Another important matter in teaching students to study 
is to show them that there are certain principles of intel- 
lectual economy which ought constantly to be considered. 
Thus, it is a very bad investment of time to do over and 
over again in a superficial way a task which could be mas- 
tered, once for all, by giving a little more time to it than 
one naturally gives. One of the best arguments in favor 
of economy is to be found in the case of a student who 
wastes his time by looking up a word in a vocabulary 
every time he finds it in the text. Thus, in translating a 
Latin passage a student comes to a certain word. He 
turns to the vocabulary and finds that there are fifteen or 
twenty meanings given for this word. He runs his eye 
down the list of meanings and carefully selects the one 
that will serve his purpose. He tries to overlook the other 
meanings because they do not serve his purpose at the 
present moment. From one point of view this seems to 
be economical. One is trying to translate a given passage, 
and to stop and consider the meaning of a word in general 
will be distracting. Furthermore, our textbook vocabula- 
ries are frequently so made up that a student would be 
quite unable to get at the general meaning of the word 
by reading over the full statement given. Even the worst 
vocabulary that has ever been constructed would, however, 
if properly looked at, give some clue to the general mean- 
ing of the word, and offer some suggestions as to the 
reason why all of these different meanings are attached to 
the single root. If the student would stop, therefore, and 
read over the list of words in the vocabulary with a view 
not. merely to selecting the particular meaning which he 
needs for the given passage but also with the view to 
recognizing the general character of the word; if he would 
pay enough attention to the word itself so as to form its 
  
ch gas
-P-A-G-E-460
  450 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
acquaintance and prepare for later uses of the word, he 
would, by a small expenditure of additional time, effect a 
genuine economy in the long run. Somebody ought to per- 
suade the student of Latin at the outset that he is going to 
take the course for a whole year, and that an investment 
of time to-day which will economize his time all through 
the year is well worth his consideration. 
ANTICIPATION OF APPLICATIONS 
This looking forward into the future and trying to see 
all of the different applications of a present mental act is an 
attitude which students do not often cultivate. In geom- 
etry, for example, it would be well to ask a student while 
he is working on the relation between triangles to look for- 
ward himself, and to consider what advantage this part of 
the study will be to him in further study of geometry. Are 
the principles which he is taking up at this time likely to 
turn up in later combinations? If so, what kind of combi- 
nations could one expect ? To make each individual lesson 
an introduction to the rest of the subject is worthy of the 
explicit attention of teachers. Not only should the learner 
in this way try to make a subject apply to the later stages 
of the same study, but one may well expend time in calling 
attention to the possible applications of a given subject to 
other phases of life which are more remote. Undoubtedly 
our method of subdividing and sharply separating subjects - 
has made this looking for applications a relatively unusual 
type of the work of the school. Indeed, it may be said that 
very few teachers, to say nothing of students, are trained 
to look for the applications of their subjects. If one is 
studying history, he ought to be interested not only in the 
event which is now under examination, but he ought to 
look forward to some of the probable implications of the 
events. To ask what is likely to come from the combination
-P-A-G-E-461
  TEACHING STUDENTS TO STUDY 451 
of events which one encounters in to-day’s history lesson 
is to make an entirely legitimate historical study and is 
practically suggestive, in view of the fact that our esti- 
mate of the future is always based on our own analysis 
of present situations. Historical studies might serve, there- 
fore, to cultivate the power of looking critically into the 
future, which will be of very great importance to students. 
This kind of application of history to present needs does 
not mean that we merely try to explain the present by 
history, but we try to cultivate in the student some recog- 
nition of the complexities which confront all of our execu- 
tive officers in the government. For example, if one sees 
the difficulty of telling the consequences of the French 
Revolution as a purely historical problem, one will recog- 
nize immediately how difficult it is for the present-day 
legislators to see the possibilities which may grow out of a 
given piece of legislation. If it is difficult to tell how far a 
nation is to be plunged into conflicts through a single nego- 
tiation, then we can be prepared, in dealing with our own 
current events, to recognize that any act of our government 
is likely to be of far-reaching consequences. 
In the same way, one may use other examples. Suppose 
that when studying a series of principles in algebra the 
student is called upon to find some use to which the prin- 
ciples may be put. These uses need not be applications 
to commercial life and business life. The assumption that 
application of a subject always means a turning of it into 
business or into constructive activity is, as was pointed out 
in an earlier chapter, a limited notion of what is meant by 
application. One ought to realize that algebra is an instru- 
ment for the solution of problems in the sciences. The 
student has a right not only to the general statement that 
mathematics is necessary for the solution of scientific prob- 
lems ; he ought to be encouraged in the algebra class itself 
to look for possible uses that can be made of the principles 
 
-P-A-G-E-462
  
452 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
of algebra. There is no better exercise in any course than to 
encourage the student to prepare in a large way for future 
uses of the present lesson. Students should be taught to 
do this with a full recognition of the intellectual economy 
which they are thus securing. 
STUDENTS PROFIT BY USE OF STANDARDS 
One of the methods which is of great importance in 
training students to study is the method of giving the 
student some standards which will help him judge of the 
success of his own work. S. A. Courtis,! in discussing his 
arithmetic tests, calls attention to the fact that these tests 
are of value to the individual student because one can train 
the student himself to judge of his ability as compared with 
his own past achievements and as compared with the legiti- 
mate expectations to be imposed on people in his class. If, 
for example, the student knows that the other members of 
a certain class can, on the average, complete a certain series 
of addition exercises in twenty seconds, he has a standard 
which he can utilize in his own practice. He can try to do 
this exercise in twenty seconds. If he succeeds in doing it 
at this rate, he knows that he has come up to the sixth- 
grade standard. Furthermore, he can be told that this is 
the standard required in business. If, on the other hand, 
it takes him forty seconds, he knows that he must drill 
himself more or he will be rated as backward. Further- 
more, if he records the time which he requires every time 
he performs exercises of addition or other processes, he 
will be able to watch his own improvement. There is noth- 
ing so stimulating to a student as to see the rate at which 
he is improving. On the other hand, there is nothing

School Inquiry of New York City (Part II, Subdivision I, Section D), 
Vol. I, p. 489.
-P-A-G-E-463
     TEACHING STUDENTS TO STUDY 453 
so discouraging to a student as to be unable to determine 
whether he is making intellectual progress or not. It is 
for this reason that many a student becomes discouraged 
in his class work ; he does not know whether he has a right 
answer or not, and is therefore greatly disadvantaged as 
contrasted with the student who has some method of 
checking up his results. 
In a recent number of the Hlementary School Teacher 
a clever device was described by J. W. Graham for show- 
ing grade pupils whether they can add rapidly or not by 
asking them to add at the rate at which a pendulum swings. 
The pendulum is gradually shortened until the limit of 
speed is reached. The student knows from the length of 
the pendulum what degree of success he has attained in 
the adding process. 
THE VALUE OF STANDARDS IN SELF-ADJUSTMENT 
It is fairly easy in such subjects as arithmetic to give the 
student some kind of a standard which he himself can adopt 
and follow. It is of course by no means as easy to give 
him similar standards in some other subjects; but he ought 
to be made aware of the meaning of standards. One device 
that can be adopted is to ask the student to rate himself in 
the degree of preparation which he has on a given subject. 
Get him, in the case of an examination, to tell how well 
he thinks he did his work, and help him check up his judg- 
ment by showing him how little this judgment comports 
with the actual results of his work as judged in the light 
of the work of the class as a whole. Call attention to the 
fact that the estimate which the student has of his own 
work differs from the estimate which he ought to have 
because he does not know how well others do their work. 
Show him that comparative standards are significant in 
1 Vol. XIV (1914), p. 348.

  454 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
estimating one’s own value in the commercial world or in 
the world of intellectual achievement. A student should 
know about how long he ought to spend in the preparation 
of a lesson. Individual differences must of course be 
taken into account, but it is important that the student 
should come to recognize some of his own peculiarities. 
If a student is a slow reader, he ought first to realize the 
possibility of improving the rate of his reading ; and, in the 
second place, he ought to realize that it is going to cost him 
more time than it costs some other members of the class 
to get up his work. In spite of his individual peculiarities 
he ought never to be allowed to assume that his mental 
efficiency is satisfactory if he requires an indefinite length 
of time for the execution of a certain task. The teacher 
ought to know the time and effort required to master every 
assignment, and ought to be able to say to the class that the 
rapid members are expected to get the lesson in a half hour, 
the slower members certainly inside of an hour and a half. 
If our educational work were thus standardized, it would 
be a very great advantage to both students and teachers. 
There would be no evasions between students and teacher 
with regard to the amount of effort that the students need 
to expend. There would be very much greater certainty in 
our definition of standards of institutions. At the present 
moment we turn a student loose on a certain section of a 
course and ask him to get it ready. The sections which we 
assign from day to day are very rough divisions, given out 
without exact knowledge on the part of the teacher as to the 
amount of effort which is required on the part of the student. 
PROGRESSION A Test OF EFFECTIVE TRAINING 
Finally, the student ought to realize that the best check 
of his own work is his ability to go on with the next line 
of work. He ought to realize that the natural penalty of
-P-A-G-E-465
  
TEACHING STUDENTS TO STUDY 455 
failure at one point is increased difficulty in the next 
stages of the course. In order to make him distinctly aware 
of this relationship between different parts of the course, 
it will be necessary for us, first of all, to reorganize our 
education material in such a way that there shall be real pro- 
gression in intellectual demands made upon the student. 
Our discussion of standards for the student, therefore, 
leads us back to the problem of standardizing and system- 
atizing our various courses. Heretofore our courses have 
been systematized from the point of view of the subject 
matter to be covered. Some courses haye“also, in a rough, 
general way, been systematized with reference to the dif- 
ficulties of intellectual problems presented. It is assumed 
that the course grows more and more difficult as one goes 
forward to the higher stages of the subject. There is cer- 
tainly no consistent development of this ideal type in many 
of the subjects of the curriculum. For example, in an 
earlier chapter attention was called to a conspicuous illus- 
tration of the lack of development in intellectual demands 
found in the courses in history. Often hard courses are 
purposely put near the beginning of the school work. For 
example, we very frequently have evidence that the algebra 
course in the first year is one of the most severe courses in 
the whole curriculum of the high school. The first science 
course which is given in a department is very frequently 
much more severe than the later courses in the same subject. 
Educational institutions very frequently point out the fact 
that the difficult courses at the beginning are intended to 
weed out the poor students. In the work in home econom- 
ics, for example, it has frequently been the case that a 
severe course in scientific chemistry precedes a number of 
very easy courses in the practical art of cooking. 
This failure to give a student any progressive series 
of requirements in the different subjects is a mistake from 
the point of view of the student’s own intellectual habits. 
 
-P-A-G-E-466
  456 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
Having mastered a given subject, the student feels the need 
of a progression of some sort in his own intellectual life, 
and the school ought to give him this satisfaction and also 
this test of his own earlier work. 
TRADITIONAL COURSES EMPHASIZE PROGRESSION 
Latin and some of the other traditional subjects are 
undoubtedly in excellent form in just this respect and are 
better organized than the scientific or historical subjects. 
Furthermore, the nature of language development is such 
that accumulation of training comes as a necessary result 
of larger contact with the words and constructions which go 
to make up the language. If one has read a certain amount 
of Latin, he finds that it is easier for him to read the next 
Latin passage to which he comes. The acquisition of facility 
in reading Latin is thus a kind of natural indication to the 
student of his progress in the subject. 
ScHooL SUBJECTS REQUIRE PsycHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS 
The reorganization of all of our courses with this prin- 
ciple in mind will be worked out when teachers see the im- 
portance of making a definite catalogue of the intellectual 
processes which students cultivate. For example, suppose 
the history course could be organized in such a way that 
the demand made upon students in the earlier years of the 
history course were, first of all, for ability to comprehend 
a coherent narrative of successive events. Suppose that at 
this stage we did not demand any very large explanation 
of the events studied. Suppose that at the second stage of 
his study we asked the student not only to understand the 
history that he is studying, but also to understand the physi- 
cal facts which influence history, making at this stage of 
the course a correlation between history and geography.
-P-A-G-E-467
  
TEACHING STUDENTS TO STUDY 457 
This would demand a power of comparison and associative 
thinking. Suppose that in the third stage we asked for a 
mastery of evidences upon which history is based; that is, 
a critical evaluation of the original sources. Suppose finally, 
at the last stage of historical discussion, we asked the student 
to make a critical comparison of the different authorities 
who have attempted to interpret a given period. Whether 
the historian would agree that this is the best order in which 
historical methods are to be taught or not, the example at 
least serves to call attention to the fact that there is a possi- 
ble progression of intellectual demands within the course. 
The present tendency in history is for the most elementary 
student to be brought in contact with all of the possible 
modes of historical interpretation. Thus a teacher who has 
studied history through original sources, and who has seen 
the geographical correlation of history, assumes that all the 
different mental processes which are involved in the study 
of history can be aroused in the beginner. He starts out, 
therefore, to give the most complex reasoning about his- 
torical events to the elementary student. The elementary 
student becomes confused and is satisfied to get half of his 
lesson, never developing any standard of completeness ; and 
the teacher is satisfied with a partial achievement on the 
part of the student because he recognizes that there are 
some aspects of the situation which are evidently too com- 
plicated for the student. The difficulty in this case is that 
the teacher has not analyzed the ability of the student, and 
has not developed in his own mind any notion of real pro- 
gression which would make it possible to test the student’s 
achievements in the first part of his course by ability to go 
on in the later parts of the work. 
 
-P-A-G-E-468
  458 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
Screncr COURSES LACK PROGRESSION 
The difficulty which has just, been pointed out in history 
is also one of the conspicuous difficulties in the organization 
of science work in the schools. A student studies a little 
botany or a little physiography in the earlier part of his 
course. He is then transferred to a physics course or a 
course in general biology, and he begins all over again with 
very simple problems and very simple methods of scientific 
investigation. His first science course goes forward rapidly 
from simple problems to complex problems. His second 
science course begins as though nothing had ever been done 
to train him in scientific methods. Indeed, the organization 
of our schools is such that we frequently mix classes, putting 
in the second science course a number of students who have 
never had any of the earlier work, so that it is quite impossi- 
ble in this second class to do anything except begin at the 
early rudiments of the science, while in the same course are 
students who have done several courses in related subjects. 
Thus, science courses are very frequently badly arranged or 
not arranged at all, and the student gets only a vague gen- 
eral impression of scientific method and its application to the 
problems in the particular field. In each of these sciences it 
is the subject matter which has been the dominant interest. 
The student has never been shown that there are different 
degrees of complexity in reasoning. He realizes very slowly, 
if at all, that the first stage of a science is to collect a few 
simple facts with a certain degree of accuracy. The second 
stage of science is to try and develop some sort of a general 
principle, utilizing in support of this general principle the 
observations which one has made. The third stage is veri- 
fication; and so on. What is needed is a careful analysis 
of the mental processes which represent progress within 
the science. What we need is a list of all of the different 
kinds of mental activities that students are called upon 
 
-P-A-G-E-469
  
TEACHING STUDENTS TO STUDY 459 
to go through in each of the sciences and in each of the 
humanities. We should realize, for example, that there is 
always some memory work, and that this memory work is 
essential to comparison and reason, which come later in the 
subject. Furthermore, the student should realize as well as 
the teacher that there is sequence from memory to reason. 
TRADITIONAL SUBJECTS CAPABLE OF GREATER 
PROGRESSION 
Other examples of the same fundamental requirements 
can be presented if one comes to a criticism of Latin and 
German, which were described a few minutes ago as having 
a sort of natural progressiveness. The student of Latin 
is undoubtedly a good deal confused by his transfer from 
Cesar to Cicero. He recognizes Cicero as one of the higher 
courses in the high-school curriculum, but just why Cicero 
is more advanced than Cesar is difficult to make clear to 
a student. Finally, when the transfer comes from Cicero 
to Virgil the student becomes aware of the added body of 
material which he gets in the principles of scansion, but it 
is not at all clear that the Latin itself requires any true 
progress on his part. 
Suppose that the Latin teacher should make a radical 
distinction between the work in Cesar and Cicero in some 
such terms as these: The class has been reading Cesar. 
Now for some time, as we turn to Cicero, there will no 
longer be any requirement for detailed translation. It is 
assumed that the class can now read Latin in the original 
and can understand it without translation. Therefore in 
Cicero we shall call upon members of the class to read 
with expression the Latin text and to answer directly, 
in Latin, questions about the text. This would constitute 
a réal step in advance, a real progressive demand upon 
the student. The student would now recognize that his 
 
-P-A-G-E-470
| 
| 460 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
work in Cesar is going to be tested by the demand that he 
use the original language itself. 
Suppose that the same sort of requirement were imposed 
upon the student in German. We might say the simplest 
stage of German is that stage in which the student learns 
by translation. A later stage in German would be the stage 
in which the translation can be dropped. In setting forth 
this example one becomes immediately aware of the fact 
that the language teachers themselves have never agreed 
as to the relative difficulties of understanding a language 
through translation and through the use of spoken language 
itself without translation. Students of the direct method 
in German, for example, assume that oral expression in 
the language itself is the first stage. Translation for them 
would be a later study of a more complex type, since it 
would involve the comparison of German with English. 
On the other hand, Latin teachers have assumed that trans- 
lation is a relatively simple mental process and that the 
mastery of Latin without translation would be a somewhat 
more complex form of mental activity. Perhaps, as pointed 
out in an earlier chapter, there are conditions under which 
each of these assumptions may be regarded as true. If we 
teach simple idiomatic phrases by the oral method, prob- 
ably the use of the foreign language is somewhat simpler 
than translation. On the other hand, if we study a lan- 
guage, analytically getting at the notion of its structure 
before we try to make use of the language, perhaps trans- 
lation is the simpler process. In either case the student 
should be required to progress. 
Sussect MATTER LESS IMPORTANT THAN PROGRESSION 
The degree of complexity of the mental process would 
therefore depend upon the methods of procedure within the 
subject itself and upon the aims of instruction. It might not
-P-A-G-E-471
     TEACHING STUDENTS TO STUDY 461 
be possible to say that a certain mental process taken out 
of the context is in itself more or less complex than some 
other mental process, but the teacher, and also the student, 
should be made aware of the fact that within each method 
of instruction there is the possibility of creating for the stu- 
dent progressive demands which shall carry him within that 
subject to more and more complex forms of mental life. 
Progression within the subject is the only solution of the 
educational problem. It is to be feared that many teachers 
are satisfied with a wider range of information as the only 
demand imposed in the later stages of a given subject. 
They give more and more of the same sort of work in the 
later stages of a course without recognizing that more and 
more material of the same type and degree of difficulty will 
not constitute real educational progress. If the teachers in 
any given field would canvass their own subjects with a 
view to determining what is the demand at the later stages 
of a course, as distinguished from the demand at the earlier 
stages, we should have a series of discussions of the differ- 
ent school subjects that would be of first-class importance 
to the science of psychology as well as to the methodology 
of the subject itself. 
ORGANIZING A StuDy PROGRAM 
There are certain external devices for securing economy 
and efficiency in the work of students which depend upon 
the general principle that organization of one’s work is 
always more economical than unsystematic effort, however 
earnest. One finds that the ordinary high-school student 
has no regular plan of attack upon the subjects which he 
has to study. He goes home at night with four or five 
assignments; and the order in which he takes up these 
assignments is a matter of pure accident. Sometimes a 
student begins with the subject which he likes best; at 
 
-P-A-G-E-472
  
462 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
other times he begins with the subject that he knows will 
be most vigorously followed up in the recitations of the 
next day. Furthermore, the very fact that he has no regu- 
lar order of procedure becomes itself a distraction, because 
as soon as he begins the study of one subject he will think 
of the other subjects which he might be taking up. 
There are two ways of meeting these general difficulties. 
The first is for the student to have a regular program for 
his own work. Such a regular program as this is very 
difficult to maintain unless there is codperation between 
the student and the teachers who have his assignments in 
charge. If the student sets aside a certain amount of time 
each day or a certain sequence of studies for his work, it is 
likely that the assignments will not balance in such a way 
as to make the most economical use of his time. Still, he 
will gain something by regularity of habits, even if his pro- 
gram of study is a purely individual affair. An interesting 
report has been made by W. C. Reavis,! who organized the 
high school of which he had charge on this plan of full 
individual programs for students. Not only were the study 
hours that occurred during the school itself assigned to 
various topics, but the students were induced also to fill 
up the hours which they spent at home with a regular pro- 
gram. The result of this organization of the students’ work 
was a decided improvement in the quality and quantity of 
work carried by the students in that school. 
Another general device which commends itself as having 
certain advantages over the organization of individual pro- 
grams by the students is the organization of the general 
program of the school in such a way that the selection of 
the study which shall be treated as most important from 
day to day shall be determined by a plan arranged by the 
faculty. Thus the work of Monday should be organized in 
1*tThe Importance of a Study-Program for High School Pupils,” 
School Review, 1911, Vol. XIX, pp. 898-4065.
-P-A-G-E-473
  TEACHING STUDENTS TO STUDY 463 
all classes with a view to allowing science to have more 
time and attention from the students than any other sub- 
ject. Tuesday might be devoted to mathematics ; Wednes- 
day to history; and so on through the week. This would 
give the whole school a certain definite arrangement of its 
work, and would prepare students to lay emphasis upon the 
different subjects in rotation. Such a plan as this would re- 
quire some consultation among the members of the faculty 
as to the length of assignments, and would undoubtedly 
be advantageous from that point of view also. It would 
relieve the students of the necessity of determining each 
time just the order in which they ought to do their work. 
They would realize that they must prepare the assignment 
in the subject that has the right of way, whatever the fate 
of the other subjects. 
SELEcTING EssENTIALS 
The principle of organization which has been illustrated 
in the last paragraph should reach not only to the general 
program of the students, but should reach into each indi- 
vidual subject. The material which is presented in the text- 
book and the class exercise is of course arranged with some 
deference to the sequence of ideas in the subject matter. 
There are undoubtedly in every lesson certain cardinal 
points which the teacher is able to bring out in the recita- 
tion, and ought to impress upon the students as of more 
significance than other points in the lesson. The difficulty 
is in training students to select these important points, and 
to realize that they are the essential elements of the lesson. 
Most students read with laborious minuteness everything 
set down in the assignment, and the lesson is not organized 
in their experience around central ideas. Their ideas consist 
merely in a train of sentences, all of which are evaluated as 
though they were of the same intellectual importance. To 
 
-P-A-G-E-474
464 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
correct this monotonous emphasis on everything, each class 
exercise should at some time in the recitation be summarized 
in a general way. Some student should be asked, either at 
the beginning or at the end of the lesson, to present the 
three or four major lines of discussion which are at the 
center of the assignment. Very frequently the assignment 
of the lesson can very advantageously be made in terms 
which shall point out these major items. In this way stu- 
dents will get into the habit of summarizing all bodies of 
material which come to them in the course of an hour. 
They will thus be prepared to take notes better, because 
they will learn how to select from the material which is 
given to them those items which constitute the key to 
each one of the phases of the discussion. 
ELABORATING A THEME 
The necessary complement of the selection of the most 
important point is the cultivation of the ability to elabo- 
rate each point. Many students are able to give in very 
brief form a certain statement which is one of the impor- 
tant statements in the lesson, but they are utterly at a 
loss to take up that statement and illustrate it and elabo- 
rate it as the author of the textbook or the lecturer has 
elaborated the item. In our discussion of the methods of 
teaching English, attention was called to the fact that most 
students in American schools are quite unable to give any 
lengthy discussion of topics. One of the exercises which 
would be of great advantage in every subject is that which 
would grow out of the requirement that students take an 
important point in the lesson and write three or four pages 
on this point. Students would gain through such an exer- 
cise a much keener appreciation of the paragraphs in the 
textbook. Every author who has elaborated an idea in a 
textbook has had some reason for adding supplementary 
  
-P-A-G-E-475
  TEACHING STUDENTS TO STUDY 465 
and secondary illustrations to the main idea which he is 
discussing. These accessory ideas are just as necessary to 
the explanation of the main idea and to the development 
of connections with other ideas as is the bald statement of 
the principle itself. Students should learn how to connect 
ideas and illustrate them. They should be able to take up 
any major principle and find interesting points of connec- 
tion between that major principle and other information, 
especially information collected in other courses. A good 
deal has been said in pedagogical literature about the im- 
portance of selecting the major idea, and certainly the 
comments which have been made along this line are all of 
them justified, but relatively little has been said about the 
necessity of elaborating major ideas as indicated in the 
foregoing sentences. 
TRAINING IN GENERALIZATION 
When students have gained some knowledge of a sub- 
ject through a few exercises, it is very important that they 
should be trained in generalizing this knowledge. Em- 
phasis was laid on this point in the chapter on science 
teaching and also in the chapter on formal discipline. It is 
in place at this point to indicate some of the methods of 
generalization which can advantageously be employed in 
the classroom and in the student’s own mental procedure. 
ANTICIPATING THE FUTURE 
In the first place, as suggested above, the student-ought 
to try to look forward in the subject itself and anticipate 
the later problems which are to come up. 
 
-P-A-G-E-476
466 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
REVIEWS 
Further than this, generalization of experience can be 
cultivated through frequent reviews. Indeed, the student 
and the teacher ought to realize that the function of a re- 
view is to crystallize earlier studies in more comprehensive 
forms than were possible while the subjects were being 
studied in detail. The student who gets an impression 
that a review just before an examination means a hasty 
running over of all of the material which has been covered 
in the course will not gain from the review the advantage 
which he ought to secure. He ought to realize that, having 
learned the subject in its details, he is now in a position 
to take a more general view of the whole subject. Princi- 
ples too broad to be included in a single exercise ought 
now to be the subjects of his thought. After he has studied 
a certain period of history, for example, he ought to be 
able to characterize the whole of that period. This is a 
period during which military operations were the most sig- 
nificant public activities; this is a period during which the 
internal operations of the state were of more significance 
than any outside relations; this was a period during which 
the country prospered financially and commercially ; and 
soon. None of these general statements would be signifi- 
cant to a student, if made at the beginning of the study, in 
any such degree as they ought to be after he has canvassed 
in detail the military or commercial enterprises which are 
summarized in his final review. 
The general summary is also a great aid to the organiza- 
tion and presentation of the details if one wishes to elab- 
orate these details later in answer to specific questions. 
Thus a review in science makes it possible to hold in mind, 
through the use of general formulas, the details of physics 
or zodlogy. One needs for general education not merely 
the detailed facts about motion and forces; he ought to 
 
-P-A-G-E-477
TEACHING STUDENTS TO STUDY 467 
be able to grasp the general topics and to show that all of 
the details group together under the general principles of 
the distribution and conservation of energy. He ought to 
be able to describe in zodlogy the whole animal kingdom, 
pointing out the major characteristics of the different parts 
of the animal kingdom rather than the detailed structures 
of any particular species. 
Broad general views of this type are the significant re- 
sults of all specific courses when the student has really 
mastered the subject matter that he has been going over. 
Broad general views of this sort will also encourage stu- 
dents to realize that any subject which they study will be 
of significance to the broad-minded individual. The stu- 
dent who is going to go into business is not likely to care 
about the details of zodlogy or physics; but if he can feel, 
when he has completed a course, that he has secured nine 
or ten general principles in each of the sciences, he will be 
encouraged to regard these as permanent elements of his 
intellectual equipment, whereas now he commonly believes 
that he is at the end of the subject and is entirely content 
to forget all of the information which he has accumulated 
in these courses. 
Generalization is the most important result of any study; 
and any course which does not permit its material to be 
generalized in a few salient principles that can be compre- 
hended and carried away by the student is not organized in 
the form which justifies its retention. . 
Mental HYGIENE 
These practical suggestions for the organization of the 
course of study should be coupled with certain practical 
suggestions on mental hygiene. Every student should re- 
alize that there is a hygiene of mental operations exactly 
as there is a hygiene of physical operations. Indeed, in 
 
-P-A-G-E-478
468 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
many cases the two coincide exactly. Thus the student 
will find, if he watches carefully his own modes of study, 
that very frequently mental excitement is accompanied by 
a form of physical tension which is altogether unfavorable 
for his work. Anyone who has seen an eager student over- 
working in his efforts to get a lesson will realize that over- 
work consists in an abnormal tension of the muscles. Very 
frequently the facial muscles are so tense that the student 
is seen to be wearing himself out and expending his energy 
at an utterly unjustifiable rate. That student ought to 
be taught to relax. It is just as much a part of his intel- 
lectual training to learn to work without so much physical 
friction as it is to remember the ideas which he is reading. 
In fact, he will never be able to remember ideas so long as 
he works at that high physical tension. 
DANGERS OF OVERSTIMULATION 
Teachers very frequently transgress the requirements of 
mental hygiene when they develop in students an attitude 
which is entirely out of accord with their real needs. Thus 
a conscientious boy or girl is urged to study more because 
the teacher has fallen into the habit of assuming that boys 
and girls usually do not study as much as they ought to. 
The artificial devices adopted by such a teacher sometimes 
consist in an appeal to class loyalty or school loyalty. When 
the student, already overconscientious about his work, is 
thus urged to add to his efforts, he sits down to his task 
with his mind full of the necessity of not disgracing the 
class. He works at a high tension and under a form of dis- 
traction which is utterly irrational. Teachers ought to real- 
ize that there are many students who do not need to be 
urged to work. Some students ought to be told definitely 
that it makes no difference whether they get a certain 
lesson in great detail or not. Such students ought very   
-P-A-G-E-479
  TEACHING STUDENTS TO STUDY 469 
frequently to be encouraged to read over matter in a rela- 
tively superficial way and get the general principles, leaving 
the details to be worked out in the recitation itself. Once 
a habit of relaxed and deliberate study is cultivated, such 
a student will make progress because he needed only to re- 
duce the distraction and tension in order to take a calm view 
of the subject which he is studying. There is quite as much 
danger of one type of student losing his perspective in a sub- 
ject because he tries too hard and makes unnecessary mo- 
tions, intellectual and physical, as there is of another type 
of student failing because he does not study enough. 
DANGERS OF DISTRACTION 
Of course there are and always will be students who 
need to be encouraged to work. The teacher must learn 
to discriminate. The people who do not work enough are 
either constitutionally phlegmatic or they are distracted 
by outside engagements. Outside engagements constitute 
a much more common source of distraction in the school 
than do constitutional limitations of any sort. A recent 
study 1 which has been made of this matter goes to show 
with perfect definiteness that students who have numerous 
other engagements fail in their school work just because of 
these outside engagements. A student ought to realize and 
the parents of students ought to realize that a certain amount 
of energy is at hand during the school period. It is entirely 
legitimate for the student and his family to decide that this 
energy ought to be expended on activities other than those 
covered by the school curriculum. For example, it is un- 
doubtedly legitimate for the student to take a course in 
art or music; but if this work outside of the regular cur- 
riculum is taken by the student, there ought to be such a

-P-A-G-E-480
  _470 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
readjustment of the school program that the outside work 
will not simply be added to the demand which is made for 
the regular work. The fundamental principle of physical 
and mental hygiene is the principle of distribution of energy. 
Overtaxing of energy is illegitimate and disadvantageous 
from every point of view. Why not allow the student to 
go more slowly through his course of study in the school, 
in order that he may cultivate certain other lines of activity 
which are good and often more advantageous to the indi- 
vidual than are the school courses? This would mean that 
students would move through the high school at various 
different rates; and there ought to be no social or intellec- 
tual stigma attaching to this movement through the high- 
school course at a rate which is determined by the outside 
activities of the student. 
ApsustiIna StuDy TO OUTSIDE ENGAGEMENTS 
One remembers the plan which is in regular use in the 
English universities of distinguishing between students who 
are aiming at high intellectual honors and those who are 
merely passing in their courses and are using their energies 
for outside social activities. Whether this is a plan that can 
be adopted in a democracy or not, it is certainly rational in 
the sense that it does not assume that all students are go- 
ing to put forth in study the same kind or degree of energy. 
Probably we should not want to make the distinction in 
this country on the basis of the English university plan, but 
we certainly may with propriety relate the work done in- 
side the school and the work which a student is doing 
outside of school hours. If for some reason or other the 
student is going to be engaged in outside activities three 
days in the week, he certainly ought to make this a 
part of his general program. If he can afford to give 
four or five days to these outside engagements, he ought 
 
-P-A-G-E-481
  TEACHING STUDENTS TO STUDY 471 
to recognize such engagements as part of his legitimate 
program of intellectual and physical effort. ; 
What has been said with regard to outside activities ought 
to cover also those activities which are organized by the 
school as social and athletic undertakings. There ought 
to be absolutely no prejudice against recognizing this work 
and making it a part of the legitimate program of the stu- 
dents. It is a fundamental mistake to believe that the im- 
mature student can regulate without advice and supervision 
the amount of energy which he can properly devote to these 
activities outside of the regular course. If we are not pre- 
pared to put such engagements on the same footing as class 
work, we certainly must realize their relation to the work 
which is credited toward graduation ; and this relation ought 
to be adjusted in a rational way. The amount of energy 
which students have available is enormous. This fact is 
attested by their numerous organizations and numerous 
lines of activities not immediately connected with the school 
program. If one attempted to get the whole of this energy 
for school courses, he would find himself obstructed by the 
social temper of the school and of society at large. Society 
regards irregular social and recreative activities as impor- 
tant for high-school students. How far these activities may 
legitimately absorb the student’s energy is a difficult prob- 
lem for both society and for the school to solve, but it is 
certainly time that the problem received grave attention. 
Appeals must be made to the students themselves in terms 
of scientific self-management to distribute their energy with 
an economical and clear recognition of the fact that the 
energy which is available at any given time in life is limited. 
Such discussions as these lead us to the whole problem 
of secondary organization and the problems characteristic 
of the adolescent student. In the next chapter we shall 
have an opportunity to summarize briefly the general facts 
which are now available on these subjects. In the meantime
-P-A-G-E-482
  472 _ PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
the conclusion of the present discussion is that there ought 
to be a definite, conscious recognition on the part of students 
of the necessity of studying mental hygiene. Mental hygiene 
is quite as important as hygiene of buildings and of the phys- 
ical system. Mental hygiene involves a study of individ- 
ual differences; it involves a study of human energy and 
its distribution ; it involves the recognition of the fact that 
the course of study is only one factor in an education, but 
a factor which must be safeguarded by a clear recognition 
of the fact that the course of study cannot be pursued un- 
less the intellectual and physical conditions under which it 
is presented are favorable to this pursuit. 
EXCELLENT STUDENTS REQUIRE THE MAXIMUM 
or ATTENTION 
Finally, it should be emphasized once more that all this 
discussion about how to study and how to organize intellec- 
tual material and distribute energy is more important for the 
strong student than for the weak or mediocre student. We 
commonly recognize the necessity of helping the student 
who is failing, though we usually do this rescue work badly 
because we have not given due attention to good habits of 
study. It is time for us to learn how to guide those who do 
excellent work quite as much as those who do a low grade 
of work.

  CHAPTER XIX 
GENERAL PROBLEMS OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 
GENERAL SOCIAL AND HyGiEnic PROBLEMS 
Casual reference has been made in earlier chapters to 
general psychological conditions which govern all of the 
activities of school life. A relation of friendly codperation 
between teacher and students is one such general condition. 
Grave consequences for the intellectual life of students 
follow failure to establish friendly relations. Furthermore, 
favorable hygienic conditions must be provided for school 
work. The physical conditions which are necessary for 
healthy functioning of the nervous system must be secured 
if there is to be vigorous and productive mental work. 
SPECIAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE HiagH ScHOOL 
It is not the purpose of this chapter, however, to enter 
into a discussion of these general facts of school hygiene 
and mental hygiene. We shall discuss what might be called 
the problem of social hygiene. There are certain unique 
characteristics of the high school which determine the social 
and mental atmosphere of this institution. These unique 
characteristics of the high school affect the intellectual work 
of the students in such a degree that we shall be able to 
understand the work of each department only by defining 
the place of this department in the general scheme. We 
shall accordingly take up in this final chapter such general 
characteristics of the high school as influence the activities 
of the students.

474. PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
GENERAL SOCIAL CHANGES 
A generation ago the high school stood apart from the 
common schools as an institution to be attended by the 
select. One reads the history of American secondary schools 
with a clear recognition of the fact that fifty years ago the 
ordinary family did not expect to send its boys and girls 
through secondary schools. It was not until the rapid devel- 
opment of the secondary schools in the eighties and subse- 
quent decades that the general social attitude toward the 
. high school came to be something like the attitude toward 
the elementary school. In fact, one can trace a very inter- 
esting evolution of the relations between the two schools. 
In the older sections of the country there was a vigorous 
effort made to extend the elementary-school period so that 
every child might have as much education in the common 
school as possible. We find, therefore, that in New Eng- 
land there was an extension of the common school to in- 
clude the ninth year of school life. Even to-day one can find 
in many of the cities of New England a nine-year elemen- 
tary school. This nine-year elementary school is the expres- 
sion of a high economic and social development. Since the 
common people did not expect to send their children to 
the high school, it was natural that they should seek for 
these children as full an opportunity of elementary-school 
life as possible. The difficulty with the nine-year elemen- 
tary school was that it did not provide in the upper grades 
for any training other than that which had been traditional 
in the lower grades. The ninth grade offered nothing but 
mere repetitions and timid extensions of the work done 
in the lower grades.
-P-A-G-E-485
     
PROBLEMS OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 475 
Tue Hiew ScHoort AS PART oF THE ComMon SCHOOL 
In the newer sections of the country there is absolutely 
no disposition at the present time to extend the elementary 
school through the ninth year. If one visits the elementary 
schools of the Middle States he finds, indeed, that there is 
great eagerness on the part of communities to provide as 
full an educational opportunity as possible for the young 
people of these communities, but it never occurs to a com- 
munity in the Middle West that it is desirable to extend 
the elementary school. The fact is that the high school is the 
natural place for most of the young people in the community 
to continue their education, and access to the high school 
is made so easy that there is no reason for an extension of 
the elementary school. There probably will never be a rep- 
etition in newer parts of the country of the New England 
phenomenon of an added year of elementary education. 
The same general movement appears in the South, where 
there is no disposition to extend the seven-year elementary 
school which resulted from the relatively unfavorable eco- 
nomic conditions that limited the development of public 
common schools. The seven-year school appeared merely be- 
cause it was not possible, on account of economic conditions, 
to reach the full organization of New England or of the 
middle states in the North. But this seven-year elementary 
school has served so well the purposes of education, and in 
the meantime there has been so vigorous a development of 
secondary education in the more progressive communities, 
that there is a consensus of intelligent opinion against 
extending the seven-year school into an eight-year school. 
We have, accordingly, in this country at the present time 
three types of elementary schools, the seven-year school, the 
eight-year school, and:the nine-year school.! All of these

School,’’ Elementary School Teacher, 1918, Vol. XIV, pp. 20-28, 82-92.
-P-A-G-E-486
  476 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
will be understood when one recognizes the fact that the 
present-day movement is in the direction not of the elabo- 
ration and extension of elementary education, but rather in 
the direction of amalgamation of the elementary school with 
the high school in such a way that the latter institution 
shall become a part of the common-school system. 
This new attitude toward public education is of the high- 
est advantage because it opens the way for any readjust- 
ment which can be justified by scientific studies of education. 
So long as there was a breach between the two schools the 
problem of readjustment was complicated by institutional 
barriers. With these barriers removed, there is no reason 
why considerations relating to intellectual and physical 
development should not come into the foreground. The 
social movement which has opened the high school to all 
the children is therefore a movement toward the best 
educational organizations. 
Errect oF Rapip INCREASE IN ATTENDANCE 
The clearest evidences which appear within the high 
school itself of the adoption of this institution into the 
common-school scheme of education appears in the rapid 
growth of the high schools. The facts which have frequently 
been summarized in the reports of the Commissioner of 
Education show that during the decade immediately preced- 
ing 1900-1901 the number of secondary schools, including 
both private and public, increased nearly 100 per cent, and 
the number of students increased in a somewhat higher ratio. 
In the decade from 1900-1901 to 1910-1911 the number of 
schools increased from 8210 to 12,213, and the number of 
students increased from 649,951 to 1,115,326. At the end 
of the year 1911-1912 there were 13,268 schools and 
1,246,827 students. This great increase in the number of 
students attending high schools indicates that the social
-P-A-G-E-487
     PROBLEMS OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 477 
movement in the direction of a democratic institution is very 
strong. Such an influx of students brings into the high school 
every possible kind of interest. It is not merely the students 
who are going to enter the professions who now take a sec- 
ondary course. Many students enter the high school with a 
definite knowledge that they are going into business or into 
the other nonprofessional activities of society. When a va- 
riety of interests begins to assert itself in the student body, 
consequences are sure to appear in the organization of the 
course of study and in the intellectual life of the school. 
It is quite impossible to think of a rigid required course 
under the social conditions represented by this increase in 
the high-school population. It is quite impossible to think 
of a policy of elimination of students on a basis such as 
was laid down in the earlier days of the secondary school. 
We shall not attempt to describe in any detail the psycho- 
logical consequences of this movement toward democracy. 
Certain disadvantages doubtless appear with this rapid ex- 
pansion. The individual student is distracted by the be- 
wildering variety of social relations. The tendency to pay 
attention to people rather than to studies is often remarked 
as one of the dangers of the present-day high school. On 
the other hand, the constant emphasis on social and practical 
relations has a broadening influence which no subject of 
instruction taken by itself can supply. The psychological 
atmosphere is broad and free, and the study which goes on 
in the school and at home is radically affected by this new 
and stimulating social environment. 
A Wiper INTELLECTUAL VIEW CHARACTERISTIC 
OF THE AGE 
A further change in the psychological atmosphere is to 
be explained by calling attention to the productive scholar- 
ship and wider national life which have in recent years given 
 
-P-A-G-E-488
478 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
to the high schools a new body of material of instruction. 
The rapid enlargements of modern science and the exten- 
sion of commercial relations are so obvious that a mere 
reference to these without any effort at quantitative evalu- 
ation suggests one of the major causes for the vigorous 
intellectual life of the age. The boy who went to high 
school in 1890 had no such interest in European civilization 
as does the boy who twenty-five years later enters upon his 
high-school course. The present-day boy may be interested in 
Europe because he expects to develop commercial relations 
with some country in Europe or he may be interested for 
the general reasons which prompt all of us to consider the 
place of the United States in the politics of the world; but 
it is certain, whatever the motive, that the high-school boy 
of to-day knows more about European affairs than did his 
father when his father went to the high school. In the same 
way natural science has come to be one of the general pos- 
sessions of society. A generation ago natural science was 
the field of the specialist, and the applications of scientific 
principles in the industrial and mechanical world were com- 
paratively few. To-day all sorts of complex mechanical 
devices are familiar facts in the home and in community 
life. The high-school student must be introduced to all 
of the underlying principles which govern these industrial 
changes. Indeed, so urgent has come to be the need for 
knowledge of mechanical principles: that some of this ma- 
terial has been introduced into the elementary schools as 
well as into the high schools. 
AGRICULTURAL HicH ScHOOLS 
In its attempts to deal with all of the new problems that 
are arising, the modern high school is boldly trying the most 
radical experiments. One finds that a school has arisen in 
rural: communities known as the agricultural high school. “ 
 
-P-A-G-E-489
  PROBLEMS OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 479 
This agricultural high school is attempting to develop a 
body of knowledge which shall be appropriate to the age 
and maturity of the students and shall at the same time 
serve the definite social end of training members of the 
community to remain in the rural districts and carry on 
their life work in agriculture. 
TECHNICAL SCHOOLS 
Parallel with this agricultural high school there have 
grown up in the cities technical education and commercial 
education. These various types of training have asserted 
themselves with sufficient vigor to receive the enthusiastic 
support of the community. It costs more to build and equip 
a technical high school, and the cost of maintenance for such 
a school is much higher, than that of an ordinary school. 
But the communities in which these schools have been 
established have usually supported them with even greater 
willingness than they have manifested in providing for the 
ordinary school. 
READJUSTMENT OF STANDARDS 
Agricultural and technical high schools have not hesi- 
tated to abandon most of the standards which were familiar 
to the old-fashioned classical high school. This abandon- 
ment of familiar standards has led to criticism and counter 
criticism. Colleges and academic people in general have 
questioned the propriety of many of the courses which are 
offered in these technical schools, on the ground that they 
are lacking in power to train the student. The technical 
high schools have retorted by criticizing the colleges and 
the classical courses as thoroughly formal and unproductive. 
We have, therefore, the extraordinary sight, at the present 
time, of a great social movement which is pushing in the
-P-A-G-E-490
  480 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
direction of the enlargement of secondary education while 
the academic world seems to draw back and hesitate, reject- 
ing many of the experiments in secondary education and 
exhibiting skepticism about the movement as a whole. 
Perhaps one of the most striking evidences of the com- 
plexity of the present situation is the long list of agencies 
at work trying to standardize the courses of education in 
secondary schools. Since the Committee of Ten completed 
its work numerous efforts have been made to enlarge in 
some form upon the work of that committee. There can be 
no doubt at all that the bringing together of material by the 
Committee of Ten on the course of study promoted very 
greatly the organization of secondary schools. That commit- 
tee did its work just.at the beginning of the epoch of rapid 
expansion, and its influence can hardly be overestimated. 
But the time is long since past when a well-organized high 
school can be satisfied with the recommendations made at 
that time. At first thought, therefore, it has seemed to some 
desirable to recommend another such committee. A study 
of the recent history of the high school, however, discourages 
so simple a device. 
In the first place, there is very little possibility at the 
present time of devising one formula which will include all 
parts of the country. The Middle West has a type of high 
school which no one born and bred east of the Allegheny 
Mountains can comprehend. The committee which tries to 
put the high schools of Cincinnati and St. Louis into the 
same general scheme with the high schools of Hartford and 
Worcester finds that it is dealing with incommensurable 
quantities. The tendency, therefore, has been to carry on 
standardizing through a number of distinct, local agencies. 
In the second place, development of courses and plans 
of instruction has gone forward at such a rapid rate that 
standardization in the ordinary sense of definition before 
the course is given is no longer possible. The experience
-P-A-G-E-491
     PROBLEMS OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 481 
of the North Central Association of Colleges and Second- 
ary Schools in this respect is very striking. The work of 
numerous departmental committees became so rapidly anti- 
quated that even the effort to keep up these detailed reports 
has lapsed. 
ExcressIVE EMPHASIS OF QUANTITATIVE STANDARDS 
In a period of rapid readjustment the tendency of human 
nature to grasp at the one’ easy device of quantitative eval- 
uation has unfortunately dominated thought and action. 
We have a quantitative standard all over the United States. 
It is a fiction of the most ludicrous transparency, but it 
seems to be satisfying to some who know little about the 
real conditions, especially to those who solemnly sit in 
judgment on those graduates of high schools who wish 
to go to college. 
NuMBER OF REQUIRED UNITS HAS RAPIDLY INCREASED 
Let us consider briefly some of the facts regarding our 
present-day quantitative standard. When the definition of 
a high school was given by the Committee of Ten, it was 
assumed that the student’s weekly program might consist 
of sixteen periods of work, with a possibility of extension 
in exceptional cases up to twenty. Nowhere in the report of 
the Committee of Ten are more than twenty mentioned ; 
and wherever twenty periods are mentioned it is evident 
that the Committee regards this number as an extreme 
maximum. If a student carries sixteen hours of work a 
week, as the Committee of Ten evidently intended that he 
should, he would complete at the end of a four-year course 
twelve or thirteen units of work. Or else a unit would 
consist of four periods a week. This was a very familiar 
kind of requirement when the Committee of Ten was doing
-P-A-G-E-492
  
482 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
its work. To-day no secondary school could maintain itself 
as a first-class high school if it gave to its students twelve 
units of work in a four-year high-school course. Furthermore, 
all of the standardizing agencies discourage four periods. 
Fourteen is the absolute minimum to which the school may 
fall, and sixteen is the common requirement for graduation. 
The ordinary student in an American high school expects 
therefore, to take at least four units of work each year. In 
order to be quite safe in completing four units a year, he 
is likely to take five. In many cases the school is so organ- 
ized that during the years when the student is taking work 
which is, for the most part, required, he will regularly find 
himself required to take more than four units of work. In 
some cases the excess beyond four units is dropped before 
the end of the year, and in some cases the student fails in 
one or more of his courses, but readjusts and achieves grad- 
uation at the end of the fourth year because of the excess 
units which he elects at some time during his course. 
Furthermore, there are many students who are anxious to 
get off the major part of their requirements in the early 
years of the course, so that they may have a light election 
of studies during the last year. Finally, many students 
complete the high-school course in less than four years 
by taking five units. 
Motives For INCREASE IN NuMBER OF UNITS 
The agencies which have been at work increasing the 
number of units demanded of high-school. students have 
been prompted in part by the desire to include in a given 
student’s training a large number of subjects. As the re- 
quired classical curriculum of earlier days has been forced 
to give way before the newer subjects, the simplest device 
which suggested itself was to add the new subjects as 
extras. English was once an extra in'some schools. To-day
-P-A-G-E-493
PROBLEMS OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 483 
there is a fringe of noncredit extras which will presently 
be adopted “for credit.” 
The second motive which has been strong in pushing up 
the number of courses required for graduation is the desire 
. to secure a greater quantity of intellectual work from stu- 
dents. Every generation of teachers has felt that students 
do not do all the work of which they are capable. Again, 
it seems natural to assume that the simplest device is to 
require more courses. It would be possible to require more 
study within the limits of existing courses, but such in- 
ternal requirements can be enforced only when instructors 
have the highest qualifications of initiative and skill. The 
external quantitative standard is therefore accepted while 
internal improvement is left to the vicissitudes of chance. 
EMPHASIS ON QUANTITY HAS BECOME FoRMAL 
The emphasis on quantity defeats its own purposes. Let 
us try, for example, to estimate the requirements which 
can be imposed on a class studying algebra in a present- 
day high school. This class is made up of members all of 
whom are taking three other units and some of whom are 
taking four other units. The class also contains members 
of the athletic teams and social organizations. The class 
is made up in large measure of young people who do not 
intend to use algebra for professional purposes. Without 
commenting at this time on the desirability of their taking 
algebra, the fact is that they are together in this class, and 
the business of the teacher is to see to it that something 
productive comes out of the undertaking. Can the teacher 
require as much work of such a class as was required 
twenty years ago when a class in algebra was made up of 
a restricted membership, in which most of the students 
were pursuing only two other subjects? Most of the 
members of the earlier class were also free from outside 
 
-P-A-G-E-494
  484 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
distractions of any engrossing type. The answer is perfectly 
clear. The quantity of work which is now undertaken in 
any particular course differs radically from the quantity 
which could be required before the quantitative standards 
were pushed up to their present level. 
STANDARDIZATION EXTREMELY DIFFICULT 
If we turn from the quantitative definition to discover 
what degree of readjustment or redefinition ought to be 
required, we find that we are in the midst of uncertainty 
and the sharpest disagreements. There is no subject of in- 
struction in the high school which has an accepted method. 
There are some teachers of the classics, for example, who 
lay great stress upon grammatical constructions; there are 
others who openly express their dissatisfaction with the 
grammatical method, and are carrying on courses which 
lay very little emphasis on grammar. College teachers of 
the classics complain bitterly because students come to them 
without knowledge of the fundamentals, as they call them, 
of the Latin language. One might go on through the list, 
pointing out the discrepancies in qualitative standards in 
different high schools. Various associations have attempted 
to define these subjects in the high school, with the result 
that elaborate committee reports are at hand, differing from 
each other so radically that it is evident that no one is pre- 
pared to allow anyone else to define for him the subject 
matter of a high-school course. 
ELIMINATION AS A SPUR TO EFFORT DISAPPEARING 
This vagueness of standards is exaggerated by a change 
in the social attitude with regard to school standards in 
general. The time was when every higher institution prided 
itself on the number of students it eliminated. One still
-P-A-G-E-495
     
PROBLEMS OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 485 
finds individual instructors and institutions which adopt 
the standard of elimination as the expression of the highest 
academic efficiency. One finds an institution, for example, 
which eliminates at Christmas time fifteen to thirty-five per 
cent of the students who were admitted in the autumn. 
This elimination is supposed to be justified, on the ground 
that during the first term the students have been tried out. 
There is, however, a growing conviction that wholesale 
elimination is a mark of inefficiency. If this growing con- 
viction could express itself, it would be something like this: 
No institution has the right to admit in the autumn students 
who are likely to be eliminated by Christmas time. When- 
ever an institution makes a wholesale elimination at the end 
of the first term, this elimination is the clearest possible 
evidence that the institution has not succeeded in establish- 
ing proper relations with the schools below. If students 
are not qualified to go on with the work of a given institu- 
tion or a given class, that fact ought to be known at the 
beginning of the course. It is the business of the higher 
institution to make its purposes clear enough to the lower 
institutions so that there shall not be wholesale elimination. 
DISTRIBUTION TAKING THE PLACE OF ELIMINATION 
Furthermore, elimination is a very doubtful method of 
treating young people in a democratic community. Would 
it not be better to find means of requiring of these young 
people satisfactory work ? Would it not be better to redis- 
tribute them in some fashion or other so that they shall 
ultimately find courses which they can take with profit and 
in which they can do a satisfactory grade of work? We 
have such a school system as that of Newton, Massachusetts, 
for example, deliberately putting into secondary courses 
young people who have not completed the work of the 
elementary school. We find that the members of this
-P-A-G-E-496
  486 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
transferred class are successful in a very high degree in do- 
ing more advanced work. We find that society in general is 
asking, not that boys and girls be eliminated, but that the 
course of study be so modified that something can be given 
to each boy and girl which will be profitable for his intellec- 
tual and social growth. This standardizing of courses by 
the demands of the communities, rather than by eliminating 
members of the community because they do not conform to 
the demands of the curriculum, is an entirely new develop- 
ment in the educational world. 
CoNTRAST BETWEEN GERMAN AND AMERICAN METHODS 
One becomes very conscious of the fact that we are work- 
ing out new standards and new methods of adjustment in 
America when he contrasts American secondary schools with 
the secondary schools of European countries. The German 
Gymnasium maintains its standards very much as the high 
school of a generation ago maintained its standards. If a 
student secures admission to a Gymnasium and does not 
conform to the requirements which are set up in that insti- 
tution, he is instantly eliminated. In fact, in Germany the 
pressure is so great for admission to this institution, and 
the conditions are so crowded in the professions and other 
social callings to which a higher education leads, that the 
whole social system favors elimination of individuals who 
seem to lack in any degree the ability to carry on the work 
of the higher schools. The result is that the German Gym- 
nasium is a highly conservative institution. It changes its 
standards and its course of study very little. It is in no 
sense a popular institution, and it is in no sense an institu- 
tion which tries to fit its course of study to general social 
demands. The other secondary schools of Germany are very 
much more liberal in the type of course which they admin- 
ister, but they have been so influenced by the Gymnasium
-P-A-G-E-497
PROBLEMS OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 487 
that their method of maintaining standards is the method 
which was formerly familiar in the American high school. 
Indeed, one finds as he considers the German school situ- 
ation that the principle of elimination goes one step farther. 
The Volksschule, or common school of Germany, is itself an 
instrument of elimination. Anyone who goes into this com- 
mon school is cut off from the possibility of a higher educa- 
tion and from admission to any one of the professional careers. 
The system of education in Germany is a dual system. One 
group of children, including over 90 per cent of the popu- 
lation, is expected to complete the work of eight years of 
elementary education and then to go into the lower, general 
activities of society. The other group of children, selected 
because of their economic conditions and social connections, 
is permitted to enjoy the opportunities of a secondary educa- 
tion; but, as indicated above, this group is so large and the 
desire to reduce the group is so intense that elimination goes 
on in the higher schools, thus adding within the secondary 
school another type of selection to the fundamental selection 
which prevents many from beginning a secondary education. 
GERMAN STANDARD UNDEMOCRATIC 
The German system makes it possible to set up and main- 
tain a definite and relatively simple standard. It is the 
arbitrary standard of the instructor who is interested in a 
special subject in which he is a specialist. He requires of 
the students under him a certain degree of mastery of the 
subject. There is very little concession to the individual. 
There is no elective opportunity to adjust courses to indi- 
vidual capacities and tastes. The product of such a rigid 
system as this is much more uniform than the product of 
an American secondary school, and it is much easier to 
understand the excellencies of such a uniform product than 
it is to comprehend the virtues of our American democratic 
 
-P-A-G-E-498
488 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
system. We sometimes find ourselves criticizing the miscel- 
laneous character of the American high-school course and 
commending the rigid uniformity of the German course. 
When one considers the historical background of our own 
American course, however, he sees how utterly impossible 
it would be for us to go back to the German ideal of second- 
ary education. We must master the difficult and complex 
problem of a democratic social standard even if we have to 
suffer for a period while we are working out the uncertain- 
ties of this type of organization. 
En@uisH EXAMINATION METHOD 
In England we find another type of more or less rigid 
requirement which contrasts with the standards of American 
schools. The method of standardizing English schools is 
the examination method. One finds in England a whole 
series of corporations and institutions devoting themselves 
to the examining of students who have reached various 
stages of maturity in the elementary and secondary schools. 
There is a corporation at Oxford, for example, and one in 
the municipal universities of central England which will 
supply to any institution a set of examination papers on 
almost every conceivable topic of instruction. Students 
write the papers, and these papers are sent to Oxford to be 
examined by official examiners. The successful passing of 
this or some similar examination is the key which unlocks 
for the student the higher opportunity of education. If the 
student is a member of a family of wealth he may try these 
examinations with deliberation, and he may make as many 
efforts as his own patience and the natural limitations of his 
increasing age will permit. He can drift along through the 
school system by taking these examinations, therefore, at a 
slow rate in the hope of ultimately reaching some institution 
where he will get the kind of training which will give him   
-P-A-G-E-499
  PROBLEMS OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 489 
admission to one of the professions. The poor boy, on the 
other hand, must pass these examinations, and must pass 
them well, in order to gain admission to the higher institu- 
tion. If he passes them well, he will get his fee paid. There 
is no free secondary school to which he may apply. The 
school is free to him as an individual because he gets a 
scholarship which pays his fee, but there is no disposition 
in any of the English secondary schools to open the door 
to all comers as does our American high school. 
CRITICISM OF THE EXAMINATION METHOD 
This effort to standardize English students suffers in 
many respects. The examinations given by the various cor- 
porations are criticized even in England as very unequal 
in their severity. One of the leading systems of examina- 
tions is commonly spoken of as too easy to give a definite 
standard to the students who are subjected to its tests. 
All examinations given by those who have not been in inti- 
mate contact with the student’s instruction are arbitrary. 
Furthermore, there is no certainty that the examination 
will pick out the best students for scholarship awards. 
The boy or girl who is fluent and able to pass an examina- 
tion gets ready recognition, whereas the slower and more 
deliberate boy has difficulty in securing access to the higher 
school. Experience shows also that the accidents which 
frequently prevent a student from showing his real ability 
in a single crucial test constitute a fatal objection to the 
examination system. Finally, if one is to judge of the suc- 
cess of the English system by the demands which democratic 
leaders are setting up all over England for freer access to 
the higher institutions, it is evident that there, as in this 
country, the movement in the direction of a more demo- 
cratic secondary education is sure to overthrow arbitrary 
and external standards.

STANDARDS FOR GIRLS 
In general, it may be pointed out that both in Germany 
and in England the admission of girls to secondary educa- 
tion is relatively less common than the admission of boys. 
Indeed, one may say that Germany has only the beginnings 
of a system of secondary schools for its women; and in 
England the opportunities for girls are also limited. 
NATURAL, DEMOCRATIC STANDARDS IN AMERICAN 
ScHOOLS 
One turns from these Old World efforts to standardize 
secondary education to American high schools, with a reali- 
zation that whatever is done here to standardize schools 
must be done in an entirely different spirit. We cannot 
tolerate a scheme which is primarily one of elimination. 
Society has opened the high school to all American youths. 
These schools are now a part of the general school system 
of the country. In population and variety of interests 
these schools represent a social movement of a magni- 
tude not equaled in any other country. Our adjustment 
of the situation must grow out of a careful consideration 
of students’ interests and of the interests of related in- 
stitutions. We must study the students. We must know 
something about the changes which go on in the adolescent 
mind. We must understand the relation of various subjects 
of instruction to individual changes, and we must be pre- 
pared to group the subjects of instruction in such a way 
that the purposes of society shall be served and a group of 
young people shall be trained for the highly diversified 
activities of social life. No theoretical or traditional stand- 
ard will serve the purposes of present-day secondary educa- 
tion. It cannot be said that the high school must give such 
and such a course merely because that course has been
-P-A-G-E-501
  
   PROBLEMS OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 491 
thought to be of value in the past. It cannot be said that 
anyone can set up a theoretical standard which gets its 
justification from a study of some subject by a specialist in 
that subject. The specialist must study also the relation of 
his subject to the students and to the demands of society. 
The high schools realize fully the new strength and 
independence which they have acquired in their purpose 
to be of service to the community at large. They are no 
longer interested in the arbitrary comments of college 
boards of admission on what ought to be the standard of a 
high school. They are not interested, indeed, in trying to 
send their products to those institutions which assume that 
the high school is a subservient and dependent organization. 
The high school is in a very real sense of the word a part 
of the common-school system; and if colleges are not pre- 
pared to connect themselves in turn with the common- 
school system of the country, the result will be the worse 
for the colleges and not for the common-school system. It 
is indeed proper that all members of the educational body 
should join in the discussion of educational standards; but 
he who would prescribe the program for a high school in 
these days of general, democratic education of all the 
young people of the country must be prepared to give for 
his prescription a better justification than either tradition 
or his own opinion. He must be prepared to say that the 
subject which he is advocating and the mode of adminis- 
tering that subject which he would defend are of genuine 
service in promoting intellectual and social development of 
young people of the age of high-school students. 
The intellectual atmosphere of the high school is seen, in 
the light of the foregoing discussions, to be an atmosphere 
of stimulating democratic experimentation. Such crudities 
and uncertainties as are manifest are symptoms of an in- 
adequate mastery of a new and complicated situation. But 
the work of both students and teachers is going on under
-P-A-G-E-502
  492 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
conditions which promise much for the enlargement of the 
influence of this institution. Furthermore, as has been 
repeatedly pointed out, the high school is now in a position 
to make the radical changes which a careful scientific study 
of its problems dictates as desirable. The restrictions which 
limited the work of the high schools in the past are largely 
broken down, or at least so far weakened that there are no 
serious barriers in the way of needed reorganization. 
CHANGES CHARACTERISTIC OF ADOLESCENCE 
Many of the considerations which must guide in this 
reorganization have been fully discussed in the foregoing 
pages. It remains to make reference to some of the general 
facts which did not properly appear in earlier discussions. 
First, there are marked external changes of physical de- 
velopment. The growth of adolescents may be described 
briefly by saying that girls develop from eleven to thirteen _ 
years of age, whereas boys show a similar growth about 
two years later. This growth consists in a general enlarge- 
ment of the skeleton and a change in the relation of the 
different parts of the body. For example, the face enlarges, 
but the skull does not change very much in its capacity. 
The trunk grows longer, while the legs show relatively 
less growth. There is an enlargement of the heart, but less 
change in the arteries and veins. There is a rapid growth 
in the sexual organs. This unequal growth of the organs 
produces certain radical changes in the internal organiza- 
tion, and these in turn are accompanied by a change in the 
functional life of the individual. The blood pressure in- 
ereases because of the change of relation between the heart 
and blood vessels, and this higher blood pressure brings 
about marked changes in the energy of the individual. 
Often there are changes in the appetite. Food which the 
child enjoyed now becomes distasteful.
-P-A-G-E-503
     Foon 
PROBLEMS OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 493 
These physical changes undoubtedly are the sources of 
some of the psychological changes which appear at the same 
time. For example, the adolescent youth is very likely to 
be moody in his temperament. He is sometimes elated to 
the point of exultation ; at other times he is depressed and 
plunged into the deepest melancholia. Girls at this period 
show marked tendencies toward hysteria. These emotional 
conditions arise from the fact that the nervous system is 
experiencing the changes which follow the increase in blood 
pressure to which reference has already been made. Again, 
investigation has emphasized the fact that the period of 
adolescence is the period of religious awakening. There 
are more conversions in the adolescent period than at any 
other period in life, and in this connection attention is 
drawn to the fact that the ceremonials of primitive peoples 
always emphasize the adolescent period as the period for 
initiation into religious orders and into religious knowledge. 
The type of reading matter which an adolescent youth en- 
joys is different from that which was enjoyed by the child 
of younger age. There is a tendency toward romanticism 
and sentimentalism. There is undoubtedly a larger interest 
in the opposite sex. The interests of boys begin to turn 
toward the occupations upon which they expect to enter 
in later life, and the girls become aware of the impending 
duties of adult life. There is, therefore, a natural empha- 
sis upon considerations of the type that look forward into 
adult life rather than backward into childhood. 
Hau1’s Discussion oF ADOLESCENCE 
The facts thus briefly reviewed are sufficiently impres- 
sive to receive all the consideration which has of late been 
given to them. The educational world owes a large debt 
to G. Stanley Hall for his work on adolescence. It is little 
wonder that a pioneer in the field should be overenthusiastic
-P-A-G-E-504
  494 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
about his finding. Hall becomes intemperately speculative 
in his writings. He marks off adolescence from the rest of 
life with all the verbal and theoretical devices at the com- 
mand of a fertile mind. Adolescence is a second childhood; 
it repeats certain crucial stages in the evolution of the race. 
It is to be thought of as the period of the wildest emotional 
upheavals. It is unique in its psychical processes and cru- 
cial for all later development. The period of elementary 
education sinks into unimportance awaiting this one final 
period of intellectual readjustment. 
Whatever there may be of exaggeration. in these fanciful 
analyses, studies of adolescence have performed the one 
great service of drawing attention to the fact that mental 
life has a certain periodicity. After the first intoxication 
of this discovery we may settle down to a careful evalua- 
tion of the facts. The changes which gradually accumulate 
during an earlier period of child life are consummated in 
adolescence in such a way that a marked qualitative and 
quantitative change takes place in mental character. Un- 
doubtedly the clearest conception can be gained of the 
adolescent period by giving attention to the way in which 
this period grows out of the preceding periods. 
INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE ELEMENTARY 
ScHOoL 
We turn, accordingly, to a brief survey of the changes 
which have been going on intellectually during the elemen- 
tary-school period. The little child just entering school has 
social interests quite as strong as those of the adolescent, 
but these social interests of little children are of a different 
type from those which appear in the later stage in which 
the high school is interested. When a child goes into the 
primary grades he is very much interested in trying to do 
everything that older people about him do. He wants to
-P-A-G-E-505
  PROBLEMS OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 495 
read not because he has any appreciation of the value 
of this art or any desire to accumulate information; he 
merely wants to be admitted to what he recognizes as one 
of society’s modes of procedure. One hears parents giving 
accounts of the early exhibitions of this desire to be ad- 
mitted to society in such form as this: A little boy of four 
years of age is found holding the newspaper patiently be- 
fore himself as though he were reading. When inquiries 
are instituted to find out what motive he has in doing this, 
it is discovered that he believes it to be the proper thing 
for all men to hold newspapers before their faces because 
he has seen his father engaged in this absorbing perform- 
ance. The strenuous efforts that are made by little children 
to use pencil and paper in writing are of exactly the same 
type. Such efforts show a desire to initiate one’s self into 
society rather than an impulse to accomplish anything for 
which there is a real external motive. The type of social 
life here exhibited is not purposeful ; it is imitative in char- 
acter. Little girls like to play with dolls for this reason, 
and boys like to imitate the carpenter and other workmen 
whom they see about them. All of these cases illustrate 
the desire of the child to become a part of the social organ- 
ism which he observes. He has in this early stage no 
standards of perfection, and he suffers no embarrassment 
from his misuse of the tools which he sees others using. It 
may be said that he is not aware of the fact that society is 
critical of anything that he does; he therefore works with 
the tools of society without the slightest embarrassment. 
DEVELOPING SOCIAL CONSCIOUSNESS 
Such an early type of social interest must be contrasted 
with the type of social interest which appears during the 
period of adolescence. Here again the youth is interested 
in the doings of society, but he has now acquired through 
 
-P-A-G-E-506
  496 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
experience a different attitude toward society. He realizes 
that people about him who work with tools are all of them 
working at a much higher degree of perfection than he is 
able to exhibit. His interests are therefore not merely those 
of imitative effort; his interests are those of social excel- 
lence. He wishes to do the thing as well as someone else 
does it. He is becoming aware of the standards of society, 
and these are embarrassing to such an extent that the 
adolescent age is a period of extraordinary clumsiness. 
It would be out of keeping with the facts to say that the 
adolescent period is any more a social period than is the 
period of early childhood, but there is a new qualitative 
aspect in the social ambition of the adolescent youth which 
marks it off from the earlier period of mere imitation. 
PsYCHOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF INTERMEDIATE 
GRADES 
Furthermore, there lies between the earlier social inter- 
est exhibited by the child in the primary grades and the 
later period of adolescence an intermediate period during 
which the interests of the child are not primarily social. 
If one watches the development of the children in the ele- 
mentary school he finds that after a period of compliance 
with all sorts of social demands during the first three years 
of school life little children begin to exhibit a type of inde- 
pendence which they do not exhibit in the primary grades. 
After the child has learned to read, for example, in the 
first two or three grades, he begins to be independent of 
the school’s attitude toward reading, and he begins to want 
to read something for himself. The type of material which 
he selects becomes more independent in character, and he 
very frequently seems to be out of joint with the school’s 
requirements. It can be shown that the fourth and fifth 
grades are centers of the greatest incodrdination in school
-P-A-G-E-507
     PROBLEMS OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 497 
work. Children fail of promotion and drop out of school in 
larger percentage than at other points in the school system. 
In matters of discipline the fourth-grade or fifth-grade boy 
is likely to be wholly unsocial in his attitudes. During the 
early years he has been obedient without very much ques- 
tion. No one ever finds a second-grade or third-grade child 
insubordinate to the school’s discipline, but in the interme- 
diate grades the child begins to realize his independence of 
society by trying experiments to see what will happen if he 
does not comply with the rules of the classroom. 
This intermediate period is also one of great interest in 
the material things of the world. So far as the intermediate 
boy is interested in society, it is chiefly because society is 
producing something in the industries. He wants to get out 
of school so that he may go into the shop or go into business. 
He has a large interest in the doings of men, especially in 
their actual productive work in the external world. He has 
learned in the lower grades something of society’s methods, 
and he now begins to apply these methods to the material 
things about him. Out of all this independent experiment- 
ing comes a vivid realization of one’s own personality and 
of the standards of society and the physical world. 
THE ADOLESCENT PERIOD 
The adolescent period which follows this intermediate 
period can be understood only by realizing that the adoles- 
cent period is immediately preceded by a period during 
which the child cultivates a very high degree of personal 
and social independence, and at the same time comes to 
recognize the existence and the importance for him of a 
physical and social environment. With all of this prelimi- 
nary training the adolescent youth also has impressed upon 
him the lesson that he must very shortly take a part in the 
adult activities of society. Is it any wonder that he is afraid
-P-A-G-E-508
  
498 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
and clumsy ? Is it surprising that he becomes moody and 
introspective ? Evidently the adolescent period is a con- 
summation of the intellectual development through which 
the child has been passing for long years. 
The productive view of the adolescent period is there- 
fore not that view which emphasizes the break between 
earlier education and adolescent training, but a view which 
finds the foundations of adolescent character in the changes 
passed through during elementary training. 
Fourteen or fifteen years of age —the period at which the 
elementary school is completed by the ordinary child — is a 
period when the changes of adolescence may be regarded as 
so far completed that the individual child already realizes 
his own personality in terms of the newer adult life into 
which he is to enter. The necessity of recognizing the onset 
of the adolescent period somewhat earlier is coming to be 
very obvious to careful students of educational organiza- 
tion. We have seen in earlier paragraphs that the whole 
social situation within the high school has been so modified 
in recent years that the school is rapidly freeing itself from 
the traditional difficulties arising from a breach between the 
elementary and high schools. Scientific studies point most 
emphatically to the necessity of explicitly recognizing the 
needs of adolescence at a period earlier than fourteen years 
of age. It is true that children of fourteen and fifteen years 
of age are consciously assuming an entirely new attitude 
toward society. It is equally true that these children ought 
to have some preparation in the years immediately preced- 
ing fourteen and fifteen for the new type of work and the 
new type of thought which they are to take up.
-P-A-G-E-509
PROBLEMS OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 499 
ANTICIPATING ADOLESCENT NEEDS 
For example, in the matter of industrial education we are 
beginning to be aware of the fact that a boy who is four- 
teen years of age needs to be prepared, in a higher degree 
than he nowis, to consider intelligently matters of vocation. 
We are keenly aware of the fact that boys between the age 
of fourteen and sixteen are not provided for in our educa- 
tional system. Consequently we are making frantic, belated, 
and ill-codrdinated efforts to provide for these young people 
some sort of industrial education. But if a boy of fourteen 
about to enter upon industrial life is in need of training, 
certainly the boy of twelve needs to have some training in 
the methods of anticipating the crucial difficulties which he 
is to encounter when he is two years older. Twelve years 
of age is the crucial period, physically and morally and 
intellectually. We cannot do the work of training adoles- 
cent youth by waiting until the period is well advanced. 
In the first place, under our present social system many of 
these youths will escape from the control and guidance of 
the educational authorities. In any case we should recog- 
nize the fact that intellectually, as well as physically, the 
period of rapid growth is one of maturing powers which have 
been gradually developing in an earlier period. The impa- 
tience of boys and girls in the seventh and eighth grades 
with a mere continuance of the elementary curriculum ought 
long ago to have drawn the attention of teachers to the fact 
that a new mode of administration is required for these years; 
and new subject matter is required if instruction is to serve 
the purpose of bridging over the education of the primary 
years and making it available as a preparation for entrance 
into the adolescent mode of thought and action. 
 
-P-A-G-E-510
  500 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
Tue HigHeR ELEMENTARY GRADES 
To some extent this demand is being met. The mode of 
organizing the work of the last two years of the elementary 
school has commonly been different from the mode of organ- 
ization which appears in the lower grades, but too frequently 
the subject matter of instruction in the upper grades has 
not been properly modified to correspond to the changes in 
the modes of administering this work. Departmental organ- 
ization has prevailed in the upper years, but the subject 
matter canvassed by the departmental teachers has been 
much like the subject matter of the grades below. Further- 
more, in some cases the educational device of a review of 
the earlier work has been adopted as the only means of fill- 
ing up these last two years of the elementary school. The 
eighth grade begins very commonly with a review of all 
that has been done in the lower grades before the small 
amount of new material permitted in this grade is added to 
that which has been administered in the first seven years. 
After a little additional material is given in the eighth grade, 
the last months of this grade are once more devoted to a 
careful restudy of all of the earlier work, in order that the 
students who go into the high school may be sent on with 
a preparation which will omit nothing of the elements that 
have been taken up in the elementary school. High-school 
teachers have very frequently been skeptical even after this 
careful reviewing, and have commenced the work of the 
high school with still another review so as to make sure 
that the work of the eighth grade has been properly done. 
All of this repetition of matter has disappointed and dis- 
couraged the students, so that many of them withdraw in 
the later years of the elementary school or in the early years 
of the high school from sheer exhaustion and lack of inter- 
est in the repetitious matter which the school offers them. 
 
-P-A-G-E-511
  PROBLEMS OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 501 
REORGANIZATION REQUIRED TO ADAPT SCHOOL TO 
ADOLESCENTS 
If instead of this failure on the part of the schools to 
recognize the oncoming adolescent period we could have a 
clear recognition of the possibilities of productive work in 
the seventh and eighth grades, there would be a general and 
radical change in the content of the course of study and in 
the method of instruction with a definite view to carrying 
the children along at a more rapid and efficient rate. The 
experiment has several times been tried in this country of 
deliberately reducing the length of the elementary-school 
course and turning children at an earlier age into the work 
which has commonly been thought of as belonging to the 
high school.! The difficulty with any such change as this is 
the prejudice on the part of teachers and parents against any 
modification of existing practices. Where the experiment 
has been tried in single subjects it has sometimes failed. 
For example, there are cases in which arithmetic was given 
up in the seventh and eighth grades and an attempt made 
to introduce algebra. Disastrous results have followed in 
some of these cases, because algebra in its common form 
is so abstract that children do not succeed in taking it up 
as readily as they do more concrete work. We have said 
enough in an earlier chapter about the possibility of modify- 
ing mathematics to make it clear that the algebra which is 
commonly offered in the high school is not suitable material 
either for the seventh and eighth grades or for the high 
school itself. If we could have, however, a reformulation of 
this subject, with emphasis upon those productive elements 
of the work which would be suitable for first-year high- 
school students, we might expect also to cure some of the 
difficulties which have appeared when teachers have simply 
1®A Seven-year Elementary School,” Elementary School Teacher, 
1918, Vol. XIII, p. 274.
-P-A-G-E-512
  502 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
carried back into the seventh and eighth grades in unmodified 
form a single subject from the high-school curriculum. The 
cure for such failures is not greater conservatism but greater 
radicalism. There ought to be a recasting of subjects, and 
there ought to be a sufficiently general importation of ad- 
vanced work into the upper grades of the elementary school 
to put an end to the timidity of both teachers and students. 
This greater radicalism will not lead to a break in the 
school organization; it will tend to cure a breach that 
has been traditional. 
In methods of administering studies there has commonly 
been a very great abruptness in the change from elementary 
to secondary education. During the elementary period chil- 
dren have been allowed to depend entirely upon their books 
for assignments; and the recitation has commonly been of a 
sort which emphasized mere repetition of the work which has 
been assigned. In the high school the child has found him- 
self suddenly called upon to listen to lectures and to depend 
upon himself very much more fully for his methods of work 
and for the arrangement of his own study program. This 
break between the high school and the elementary school 
has been a subject of frequent comment. Would it not 
seem rational, with the break distinctly in mind, to spend 
some time and energy in the later years of the elementary 
schools preparing the students for the transition? If instead 
of conducting a uniform, required course during the last 
two years of the elementary school the student could be 
induced to elect certain subjects and to take some degree 
of responsibility under guidance, would it not be possible 
to come up to the elective work of the high school with a 
much better training and preparation for the advantageous 
acceptance of the new opportunities there offered ? If the 
high-school student is to study independently, are not all of 
the principles discussed in the last chapter highly important 
for the seventh and eighth years ?
-P-A-G-E-513
PROBLEMS OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 503 
Tue Junior HicgH-ScHoot MovEMENT 
These arguments for a change in the character of the 
organization of the school have been so widely discussed in 
recent years that many schools have undertaken to organize 
junior high schools. The difficulty in many cases with these 
junior high schools is that they do not represent any genu- 
ine modification either of the course of study or of the mode 
of treating children. Very frequently a junior high school 
is nothing except the seventh and eighth grades of the ele- 
mentary school carried over into the high-school building, 
or otherwise designated by a name which would seem to 
indicate a new type of organization, but which in reality 
merely continues earlier practices under a new designation. 
There is absolutely no justification for the use of the term 
“junior high school” if the type of work carried on in the 
junior high school is exactly the same as that done in the 
seventh and eighth grades. If elementary subject matter 
and elementary methods are employed between twelve and 
fourteen years of age, then let us recognize the fact that 
the school is an elementary school. 
On the other hand, if the arguments in favor of a new 
type of organization are sufficiently cogent to make it clear 
that radical changes ought to be made, then such changes 
ought to be of a type which will influence the whole educa- 
tional machinery and will explicitly recognize the importance 
of the coming period of adolescence. 
Tue EaRLy YEARS OF COLLEGE ARE SECONDARY 
IN CHARACTER 
The unsolved problems of adolescence are not alone 
the problems of the upper grades of the elementary school. 
College courses of the first two years are many of them 
distinctly secondary in type. Every American college has
-P-A-G-E-514
  504 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
elementary courses in languages, history, and science. There 
is often the most unjustifiable duplication, as in the Eng- 
lish courses. This elementary college work is for the most 
part administered by methods appropriate only to advanced 
courses. The result is deplorable. Students go from the 
high school with incipient habits of study and some intellec- 
tual interests and encounter a situation in college classes 
which stimulates little or not at all to earnest endeavor, and 
gives even to the serious student a minimum of guidance 
in the art of study. The four-year high-school course is not 
long enough to carry the burden of secondary education. 
Students now go to college immature and unable to meet 
the expectation of those who aim in the college to encourage 
specialization. 
Readjustment is here beset with great difficulties. The 
colleges of the country are not as free as the high school 
to make changes in their organization. We may look for- 
ward to a period of transition during which the college will 
struggle to retain its present domain. The high school in 
the meantime is steadily reaching the point where it will 
do the work under public control which has up to this time 
been carried on, for the most part, in the freshman and 
sophomore years of private institutions. The problem of 
adolescent training includes such work as has been adminis- 
tered up to this time in the early college classes, and this 
work must be articulated more closely with the rest of the 
high-school course. 
REFORM URGENTLY NEEDED IN INTERESTS OF EcoNoMY 
If there were no other motive than economy compelling 
us to canvass these problems, that motive would be strong 
enough to bring serious students to a clear consciousness 
of the fact that the high school has a new problem to work 
out. As it is now, pupils from twelve to fourteen years of 
 
-P-A-G-E-515
  PROBLEMS OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 505 
age waste much time in review. From fourteen to eighteen 
they get a brief secondary course. From eighteen to twenty 
they mix secondary work with advanced courses and repeat 
in part the work of the high school, and wonder what they 
are to do next. These eight years result in training which 
every other civilized nation accomplishes in six. It is time 
that we shook ourselves loose from tradition and an in- 
coérdinated scheme of training, and organized a secondary 
school which shall do fully and efficiently in six years the 
full work of training adolescents. 
THE PRINCIPLE OF INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES 
There are certain general principles which should guide 
in bringing about these radical changes. In the first place, 
the adolescent period is one of clear recognition and em- 
phasis of individual differences. The elementary course is 
constructed on the general theory that there are certain 
fundamental forms of knowledge which must be had by 
every member of society. Everyone must learn to read and 
write. Everyone must learn the elements of arithmetic, 
geography, and some of the other fundamental forms of ex- 
perience. But when we come to the high-school period, it 
is perfectly clear that individual differences have a right to 
exhibit themselves, and must be recognized as major con- 
siderations in the organization of the school course. We 
should have a recognition, on the one hand, of industrial 
interests; and on the other hand, of professional interests. 
For some students we should emphasize science and its 
applications ; for others, literary studies. There should be 
such a modification of general courses in history as to 
appeal not only to those who are going into history as a 
specialty in the later schools but also to those who are not 
going on with the study. In short, the work of the second- 
ary school should be organized from the beginning with a 
 
-P-A-G-E-516
  506 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
clear recognition of the differences in capacity and inter- 
ests of the various members of the class. Progress in the 
different subjects with different individuals ought also to 
be at different rates. A breaking up of the class, not 
only with reference to the subject matter to be studied 
but also with reference to the rate of progress through 
these subjects, is highly important as a natural concession 
to individual differences. 
THE NEED OF GENERAL COURSES 
As a corollary of the principle of individual differences, 
or, perhaps better, as a second independent principle, we 
must emphasize-the necessity of giving to each student in- 
troductory courses in all the major fields of human expe- 
rience. Later life will demand specialization ; the period of 
adolescence is one of general training in anticipation of 
the period of specialization. 
BEGINNING OF SPECIALIZATION 
The discussion of this principle of general training in 
many fields may be coupled with the discussion of a third 
general principle which is important in secondary education, 
but is likely to be lost sight of unless it is given explicit 
attention at the beginning of the course ; namely, the princi- 
ple of continuity of work. It is advantageous for students 
that they should take a variety of different subjects only 
when this spreading over many subjects in the curriculum 
is so administered as to insure that each student shall get 
some coherent study which will equip him for later concen- 
tration. It is now difficult, in the four years which are de- 
voted to the high school, to satisfy both the demand for 
diversity of subject matter and also the demand for cohe- 
rence of work. If the student has only four years in the 
high school and is expected to cover all the major fields 
 
-P-A-G-E-517
     
PROBLEMS OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 507 
of knowledge, it is evident that his energy will be very 
largely dissipated. One of the reasons why the languages 
are having a good deal of difficulty at the present time in 
maintaining a position in the program is that they demand 
so large a portion of the high-school students’ time that it 
is felt both by parents and by the students themselves to 
be irrational to devote so much of a brief high-school course 
to the study of a single subject. If now the period of sec- 
ondary training is extended to six years, there is a possibility 
of combining the two principles of diversity of training and 
coherence of courses in a very much more advantageous 
fashion. There will be six years instead of four through 
which the diversity of interest may be spread. The clear 
recognition of the principle will lead high-school teachers 
to present to students certain general courses which general 
courses will supply the ordinary members of the student 
body with a view of the various subjects in which they 
ought to be interested, but in which they are not expected 
to make exhaustive studies. In the earlier pages of this 
volume this recommendation was made even in the extreme 
form, that certain short general courses be organized to give 
students some notion of languages other than their mother 
tongue. It has been suggested that general science might 
serve a very useful purpose in giving a view of the funda- 
mental methods of scientific operation. It has been suggested 
that mathematics courses be amalgamated in such a way that 
a student may in one year get some notion of bothalgebra and 
geometry. These suggestions are in keeping both with the 
natural development of the subjects themselves and with 
the tendencies that are appearing in secondary schools. 
At the same time one must emphasize the great impor- 
tance of giving students a coherent body of courses in some 
one or two lines. It would be a great mistake to fill up the 
high-school course with general, summary courses, merely 
introducing the student to lines of thought and bodies of
-P-A-G-E-518
  
508 PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
material. Parallel with these general courses distributing 
the student’s interests, there should be sequent courses which 
will concentrate his interests. Undoubtedly the great virtue 
of the older required course of study in the high school 
was exactly this, that it concentrated the student’s time 
and energy very definitely upon certain limited subjects, 
with the result that four years of consecutive work devel- 
oped an ability of concentration in’ one field which undoubt- 
edly influenced all of his later study and work. There is 
very little probability of our returning to the required 
course of the earlier high school. That has sometimes been 
suggested by those who are critical of our present mode of 
organization. The difficulty with the required course was 
that it designated for each individual student the lines in 
which he should concentrate. Our elective program has 
made it clear that we are going to organize our high schools 
in such a way that concentration will not be required of 
students in any single predetermined line. Let the student 
select the lines in which he is interested, but after he has 
begun work see to it that he follows some lines with suffi- 
cient energy and devotion to insure continuous and coherent 
training. This is not a compromise with the old required 
course; it is a recognition of the cardinal virtue of that 
course, and a reformulation of that virtue in terms of the 
elective organization which has undoubtedly come to stay 
as a part of our school organization. 
To these three psychological principles may be added a 
fourth. general social principle, which has already been am- 
plified in earlier paragraphs; namely, the principle that the 
duty of a democratic secondary school is not to eliminate 
students, but to guide them into courses which they can take 
with advantage. The recognition of this last principle will 
have the largest influence upon the methods of work of stu- 
dents and teachers, and must therefore be included in any 
summary of the psychological-conditions of high-school work,

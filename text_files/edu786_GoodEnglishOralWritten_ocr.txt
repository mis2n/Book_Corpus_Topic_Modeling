    INTRODUCTION 
This book, which is intended for use in the third and fourth 
grades, is divided into approximately one hundred fifty care- 
fully planned lessons for each year’s work. Plan and : « Organization These lessons are grouped into chapters, each 
composed of a series of related units’ that 
center about a common theme, providing work for a period 
equivalent in general to a school month. The lessons for 
each chapter, therefore, are not haphazard and: miscellan- 
eous but are woven together into a purposeful whole, closing 
with a complete review of all the language facts treated 
in this chapter. A special advantage of this plan is 
that the themes follow closely the activities of the school and 
correlate with the curriculum, thus obviating the need for 
separate parallel material merely for language purposes. 
The material on which conversation and written exercises 
are based has been selected with reference to its living 
interest to children and its vital relation 
to their experiences. The ‘lessons are so 
arranged that oral discussion precedes and 
prepares for written expression. The wealth of ideas con- 
tributed by the various members of the class in oral discus- 
sion is thus placed at the service of the individual pupil in 
the written exercise that follows. Similarly in the mechan- 
ics of expression, the difficulties of the written composition 
are anticipated in the oral lesson. this way the text 
recognizes the superior value of oral speech, not only as a 
preparation for written expression, but also as a means of 
enlarging vocabulary and giving power in the use of language. 
i Emphasis Laid 
on Oral Work
-P-A-G-E-5
iv INTRODUCTION 
The literary selections in the text are used not only as a 
basis for oral and written discussions, but also as examples 
of the technical facts treated in the book, and 
to a lesser extent as models of correct expres- 
sion. They suggest a wide range of interest- 
ing themes related to children’s experiences. Adventure, 
patriotism, humor, ethics, information, nature study, festival 
and dramatic incidents, occupations, and sports, all find 
expression in the literature presented and in the constructive 
language work—oral and written—which grows out of these 
selections. 
The technical facts treated in this book largely center 
about the sentence, but great care has been taken to avoid 
Technical burdening pupils with unnecessary intricacies 
Treatment that promise little or nothing for greater power 
of expression. Distinct attention is given to the’ 
cultivation of the “sentence sense,’ without which all 
language teaching is fruitless. The steady insistence that 
pupils begin each sentence with a capital and end it with a 
period, a question mark, or an exclamation mark, cannot fail 
to establish the “feeling” for the sentence as the unit of 
thought. The ability to write a good sentence is the neces- 
sary basis for writing a series of connected sentences. 
Great emphasis is placed upon correct usage, especially of 
such commonly misused words as this, these, was, were, has, 
«a2, and have. The words chosen for treatment have Scientific : 
Selection not been selected haphazard on mere personal 
opinion, but on the basis of recent scientific © 
studies showing the blunders made most frequently by 
children in oral and written expression, notably the investiga- 
tions made in Kansas City by the University of Missouri, 
the investigations made by the University of Wisconsin, and 
other similar studies. Variety of 
Literature 
 
-P-A-G-E-6
INTRODUCTION v 
The authors believe that only through systematic repeti- 
tion of language facts'and of correct forms can accurate 
. habits of expression be established. To accom-. 
plish this end, each language fact and correct 
form taught is put before the pupil again and 
again with varied associations in subsequent lessons (see 
Index). This recurrent treatment, reénforced by the reviews 
at the ends of chapters and the half-yearly and yearly sum- 
maries, provides a basis of thoroughness that it is believed 
will secure for pupils a real mastery of the fundamental lan- 
guage principles. Language teaching that does not result 
in improved expression cannot be called thorough. 
No feature of this text has been worked out with greater 
care than the illustrations. They are not mere decorations, 
but in all cases serve a distinct purpose in 
Illustrations language instruction. Notable instances are 
the group pictures on pages 163, 241, and 
267 which focus the language work upon the paragraph 
as the unit of expression. Each of these illustrations por- 
trays some well-known story or poem: for example, the pic- 
ture on page 267 is a graphic representation of Whittier’s 
“The Fish I Didn’t Catch.” After the pupil has interpreted 
the picture in his own language, the teacher may well enrich 
the composition lesson by reading to the class the complete 
original story, which is printed in the Manual. 
The pictures throughout the text are unusually rich in 
the suggestion of ideas for discussion and in the stimulation 
of the imagination. Especially happy as.a basis for con- 
versation are the interesting sketches by Mr. C. A. Briggs, 
the widely known cartoonist. The conspicuous place of 
the cartoon in present-day illustration, particularly in 
delineating humor, led the authors to include these excep- 
tional examples of this form of graphic art. Mastery by 
Repetition

vi INTRODUCTION 
In the preparation of this series, the authors have kept 
constantly in mind the fact that the function of any school- 
book is to serve as a tool for classroom use. Atten- 
tion is called to the following features of the text, 
—many of them unique—which ensure the 
maximum working efficiency in service when applied to the 
problems of the schoolroom: 
(1) A: comprehensive glossary, pages 289-296, contains 
the words of the text that offer valuable vocabulary 
training either of pronunciation or meaning. The aim 
is to leave the teacher free to use the glossary according 
to the needs of her particular class; a suggestive type 
exercise in word study based on this glossary is given 
on page 7. 
(2) The language facts taught throughout the book 
are thoroughly organized for purpose of review by means 
of review lessons at the ends of chapters (see page 11), 
half-yearly summaries (see page 69), a yearly summary 
(see page 128), and a complete summary of the book 
(pages 269-272). 
(8) The work for each year has been divided into 
approximately 150 lessons, providing convenient units 
for daily assignment. 
(4) Special lessons on dramatization, games, dicta- 
tion, and the memorizing of short literary selections, 
furnish variety and broaden the scope of the work. 
(5) A detailed table of contents, showing the topics 
treated in each lesson, and a complete index for use in 
locating every important fact treated add to the service- 
ability of the book. 
(6) A Teachers’ Manual is provided, giving detailed 
suggestions for each lesson. Special

Moraze Nature anp THE Corton Botts 
One hot September day Mother Nature found all her 
cotton bolls drooping heavily upon their stalks and quite 
white with fear. : 
“Dear children,” she cried, ‘what can be the matter?” 
One fluffy white ball told her the trouble. They had 
been so happy, he said, when their gray seeds had burst 
and the green leaves had pushed out from the stalks. And 
when they blossomed, they thought that no more beautiful 
life could come to them. But soon their life became even 
more lovely, for each blossom grew into a soft downy ball 
wrapped around a little gray seed that would go back into 
the ground in the spring. 
But now the bolls were being torn away by rough hands, 
and they knew that later they would be pressed and tied 
into huge bales and sent far away. Then they would die, 
and no one would think of them again. 
When the story was finished, Mother Nature smiled 
kindly and said, “Do not sigh any more, my dears. You 
will not be lost, It is true that you will be torn to bits, 
but you will in this way become the Friend of the World, 
You will clothe the poor and bless the sick and wounded 
with your gentle touch. You will be of use to mankind in 
all the lands the sun shines upon. You will live again in 
the good you will do.” 
And the bolls were happy and contented once more.

There was once a little girl who wanted to play all day. 
Her mother thought she would grow to be an idle girl if 
she played so much. 
“You are old enough now to do some work, little daughter,” 
she said, one day. “Even though you are a tiny girl you 
can learn to be busy.” 
But the little girl said: “Oh, Mother, I do not like to 
work. Please let me go to the woods and play before. I do 
my tasks.”’- 
So her mother said she might play for a little while. 
The child ran out of the house, across the garden, and 
down to the woods, as fast-as her feet could carry her. As 
she hurried on, a red squirrel jumped across her path. The 
little girl said to him: ‘Red Squirrel, you don’t work, do 
you? You just play and eat nuts from morning till night. 
Isn’t that all you do?” 
“T don’t work!” chattered the red squirrel. “Why, I am 
working now, and I worked all day yesterday, and all the 
day before. I have a family living in the old oak tree, and 
I must store away nuts for the winter. I have no time 
to play.” 
Just then a bee came buzzing by, and the little girl said: 
“Little Bee, do you work, or do you play all day?” 
“Work!” said the bee. ‘Why, I am always working, 
gathering sweets and making the honeycomb for you. I 
have no time to play.” 
The little girl walked along very slowly, for she was 
thinking. Soon she saw an ant down in the path, carrying 
a very large crumb of bread.
-P-A-G-E-21

“That crumb of bread is too heavy for you, Little Ant,’”’ 
said the child. ‘Drop it and play with me!” 
“T don’t care how heavy it is,” said the ant. “I was 
so glad to find it that I am willing to carry it. Oh no, I 
couldn’t stop to play.” 
The little girl sat down upon a stone to think. “’ 
mals and insects all have tasks to do, but I don’t 
the flowers work,” she said to herself. “Do you wo: 
Clover?” she asked of a little flower growing at t 
“Oh yes, I am very busy,” said the pink clover. “ 
the sunbeams every morning and keep them shut in n: 
all day long. I drink up all the moisture I can fi 
my roots, and I grow and grow, to get ready for the seed 
time. All the flowers must work,’’ said the pink clover. 
Then the little girl ran home to her mother and said: 
“Mother, the squirrels, the bees, the ants, and the flowers all 
work. I am the only idle one; I want some work to do, too.’” 
Her mother brought out a little apron which the child 
had begun to hem so long ago that she had forgotte- -" 
about it; and the little girl worked faithfully upon it. 
never again wanted to play all day long. — Selected

    Tue Bia Rep APPLE 
~ Bobby was a little boy who lived with his grandfather. 
One day Bobby’s grandfather sat by the fire while Bobby 
lay on the hearthrug, looking at a picture book. 
“Ho, ho!” yawned grandfather, “I wish I had a big red 
| apple! I could show you how to roast it, Bobby.” 
' °° Bobby jumped up as quick as a flash. “I'll get one for 
you,” he said: He picked up his hat and ran out of: the 
house as fast as he could go. He knew where he had seen 
' an apple tree down the road —a tree all bright with big 
red apples. 
Bobby ran on by the side of the read until he came to the 
big apple tree, but there was not an apple to be seen. 
 
-P-A-G-E-33
16 GOOD ENGLISH 
“Oh,” cried Bobby, “where have they all gone?” 
Then he heard a rustling through the leaves of the tree. 
“T haven’t an apple left, my dear. 
You'll have to wait till another year.” 
Bobby was surprised. ‘But where have they all gone?” 
he asked again. The apple tree only sighed. So the little 
boy turned away and started home across the fields. 
Soon he met a pussy-cat. ‘Oh, Pussy,” he said, “do you 
know what they have done with the big red apples?” 
Pussy looked up at him, saying: 
“Mew, mew, mew! Mew, mew, mew! 
I haven’t a big red apple for you.” 
Bobby went on and at last met a friendly dog. “Oh, 
Doggie, can you tell me what they have done with the big 
red apples?” he asked. 
The dog wagged his tail and barked: 
“Bow, wow, wow! Bow, wow, wow! 
If I knew, I would surely tell you now.” 
The little boy went on, until he came to a kind old cow. 
“Oh, Mocly Cow,” said Bobby, “will you tell me what 
has become of the big red apples?” 
The cow rubbed her nose against him, and saia: 
“Moo! moo-o-0! Moo! moo-o-o! 
I'd like a big red apple, too.” 
The little boy laughed and walked on until he came to 
the edge of the woods; and there was a big gray squirrel. 
“Hello, Gray Squirrel,” said Bobby. ‘Can you tell me 
what has become of the big red apples?” 
The squirrel whisked about and said to Bobby: 
“The farmer has hidden them all away, 
To eat on a pleasant winter’s day.”
-P-A-G-E-34
PART ONE 17 
Then the squirrel ran to the foot of a chestnut tree and 
began to fill his little pockets with shiny nuts to carry to 
his own storehouse. ‘Oh, thank you,” said Bobby, and 
ran up the hill to the farmer’s house as fast as he could go. 
“Good morning, my little man,”’ said the farmer; “what 
can I do for you today?” 
“Please,” said Bobby, “I want a big red apple.” 
The farmer laughed. “Come with me,” he said, “and 
you shall pick out one for yourself.” 
So Bobby and the farmer walked out to the great barn. 
There the little boy saw a great many barrels standing in a 
row, and every barrel was full of big red apples. 
“Oh, what a lot!” said Bobby. “Why did you pick 
them all?” 
“We didn’t want’ to leave them for Jack Frost, did we?” 
said the farmer. : 
“Does Jack Frost like apples?” asked Bobby. 
“He likes to pinch them,” said the farmer, “but we like 
to eat them; so we gather them in for winter.” 
Bobby looked about the barn. Near the barrels of red 
apples was another row of barrels all filled with green apples, 
and farther on was a pile of yellow pumpkins; near that was 
a heap of green and yellow squashes, another of turnips, and 
then piles of yellow corn. 
“Are you keeping all these things for winter?” asked 
Bobby. . 
“Yes,” said the farmer, ‘““we’ve been gathering in the 
harvest of all the good things that summer has given us.” 
“And do the squirrels gather in a harvest, too?” asked 
Bobby. 
“Indeed they do,” said the farmer. 
“Then that was how the squirrel knew,” thought Bobby. 
Soon the boy’s eyes began to shine. “Won't you have
-P-A-G-E-35

lots of good things for Thanksgiving!” he said. “Pumpkin 
pie, and apple pie — and everything!” 
“Well,” said the farmer, “I guess there’s plenty to be 
thankful for right here. Did you say you wanted a red 
apple, sonny? Help yourself.” 
Bobby walked up to a barrel and picked out the biggest red 
apple he could find. 
“Thank you, Mr. Farmer,” he said; then he ran home 
and gave the apple to his grandfather. 
“What a fine apple this ist” said grandfather. ‘Now 
find me a bit of string.” 
Bobby found the string, and grandfather tied one end 
of it to the stem of the apple. He fastened the other end of 
the string to the mantle shelf; and there the apple hung over 
the fire. It turned and twisted, and the juice sizzled out, 
until, by and by, the apple grew softer and was all roasted. 
Bobby brought a plate and two spoons; then he and 
grandfather sat before the fire and ate the big red apple.

All day low clouds and slanting rain 
Have swept the woods and dimmed the plain. 
Wet winds have swayed the birch and oak, 
And caught and swirled away the smoke; 
But all day long the wooden clock 
Went on, nic-noe, nic-noc. 
When deep at night I wake with fear, 
And shudder in the dark to hear 
The roaring storm’s unguided strength, 
Peace steals into my heart at length, 
When calm amid the shouts and shock, 
I hear nic-noe, nic-noc.

Tue Doc anp THE Horse 
A dog and a horse once lived in the same farmyard. In 
the spring the fields of the farm were green with grain; 
in summer they were yellow with ripening wheat; in autumn 
they were brown with the harvest. 
As the neighbors passed by this farm they always said, 
“Stefan has a fine farm. He is a lucky man.” 
One day when the dog heard these words he said to the 
horse, “Of course Stefan has a fine farm. That is because 
I work so hard. In the daytime I keep the cattle out of the 
fields of grain. At night I guard the house and barns so 
that thieves cannot enter. 
“But what do you do? I have never seen you do any- 
thing but plow or draw a cart; and you sleep all night. 
The farm could get along without you.”
-P-A-G-E-42
PART ONE 25 
‘What you say is true,” answered the horse. “You do 
keep the cattle out of the fields of grain, and you do guard 
the barns and the house at night. But did you ever stop 
to think that if I did not plow the fields there would be 
no grain here for you to watch? 
“Stefan would have no wheat and oats and barley in 
his barns. He would not need to keep a watchdog, and you 
would have no home. Perhaps I had better live in the 
farmyard a little longer. What do you think about it now?” 
And for once, the dog had nothing to say.

Tue THREE PUMPKINS 
Three little pumpkins were growing on one vine. They 
were green and round and no bigger than baby’s fist. 
“T am going to be a big pumpkin,” said one. “I am 
going to grow so big that everybody will come from all over 
the world to see me. I heard the farmer telling someone 
the other day that I should be a prize pumpkin.” 
“T am going to grow very big, too,” said the second 
pumpkin. “I am going to grow as big as the moon and 
just as yellow. I shall light the whole world.” 
The third pumpkin, who was smaller than his brothers, 
kept very still. He did not think he could ever grow as big 
as the moon, and he was so modest ‘that he did not hope to 
have all the people in the world come to look at him. All 
he wanted was to be of some use in the world. 
So he asked the toad, who came hopping along one day, 
“Of what use may a pumpkin be in the world, Mr. Toad?” 
“Oh, a pumpkin may be used for many things,’”’ answered 
the toad, “but I think the very nicest pumpkins are made 
into pies. Everybody likes pumpkin pies, but not all pump- 
kins make good pies.”

“Then I should like to be made into a pie for a little 
to eat,’ said the third pumpkin. 
The other pumpkins heard him and laughed. 
“Dear me! what an ambition!” said the first 
“to be willing to be made into a pie and eater: 
might hope to be a prize pumpkin and have everybody in 
the world come to look at him.” 
“What a silly!” said the second pumpkin, “to think of 
being made into a pie when one could light the whol: --~~'+ ”’ 
The little pumpkin did not answer, but he did nv 
his mind. Every day, when the farmer’s little 
walked along the path at the edge of the field, he 
how nice it would be to be made into a pie for he 
and thus help her to grow. 
So he drank in the dew and the rain, and grew ; 
the sun, and kept on quietly growing. By and by ___ __...

“Ah!” he said, “what a fine, large pumpkin! I 
sure it would be a prize pumpkin. I will take it tc 
village fair and all the people in the village will com 
see it, and find what large pumpkins I raise.” 
The prize pumpkin glowed with pride as the fa 
him carefully on his wheelbarrow. 
“T am sorry that ajl the people in the worlc 
coming to see me,” he said, “but I shall be seen b 
many, and one cannot have things just as he wou 
“Here is another fine, large pumpkin,” said th 
“Flere, Little Son, you may have this pumpkin for 
lantern. Put it up on a post and it will throw ¢ 
far as the middle of the street.” 
The second pumpkin sighed. This was not 
lighting the whole world! Still it would be gre: 
light part of the street.
-P-A-G-E-48
PART ONE 31 
Then the farmer saw the little pumpkin. 
“Well, well!” he cried. ‘Here is a little pumpkin, just 
the sort for a good pie. We will have a Thanksgiving pie for 
little son and little daughter and all the little cousins.” 
The little pumpkin almost burst his shell in the joy of 
what he heard. To be made into a Thanksgiving pie and 
help so many children to grow — this was better than any-. 
thing he had dared to expect. 
Then all the pumpkins were carried away to the big 
barn. Soon the farmer took the biggest pumpkin away 
to the fair. Many people stopped to look at it and said, 
“What a beautiful pumpkin!” It was such a beautiful 
pumpkin that a man called the judge pinned a blue ribbon 
to its stem, and the pumpkin was very happy. 
The little son came very soon.and took away the pumpkin 
that had wished to light the whole world. It made a fine 
jack-o’-lantern; it sent a glow halfway across the street and 
was quite content. 
But the best of all was when Thanksgiving Day came. 
Then the little daughter and the little son and all the little 
cousins sat together at the long table and the cook brought 
in a beautiful brown pumpkin pie.

Moruer’s CHRISTMAS PRESENT 
Once upon a time, just before Christmas, everybody at 
Polly’s home was making Christmas presents. 
“TI wish I could make a Christmas present, too,” said 
Polly, who was only six years old. 
“Why, you can,” said grandmother, putting her knitting 
down and smiling at the little girl. 
“When I was just your age, I made a needlebook for my 
mother as a Christmas present. It had blue satin backs and 
two flannel leaves. Would you like to make one for your 
mother?” 
“Oh, yes, yes!” said Polly, in delight. 
Grandmother had some bits of white flannel and blue 
satin in her scrap bag and the needlebook was begun at 
once. First, the leaves had to be cut just the right shape 
and size. Then Polly threaded her needle with pretty blue 
thread, and grandmother showed her how to sew it over 
and over the edges of the flannel, to keep it from raveling.

cannot be made in a hurry — not if you take as much pains 
with it as Polly did. 
Polly finished the leaves for the needlebook on the very 
afternoon before Christmas, and grandmother was just 
telling her how to make the backs for it, when Uncle John 
drove up to the house with a fine new sleigh and tinkling 
bells. 
“Pollikins! Pollikins!”’ he called, and Polly knew what he 
wanted as soon as she heard him. 
“Uncle John has come to take me for a sleigh ride,’”’ she 
cried in delight. She dropped her scissors and satin and 
flannel all in a heap and started for her hood and cloak. 
“But what will you do about your mother’s Christmas 
present if you go sleighing?” asked grandmother, just as 
Polly got to the door. 
“Oh!” said Polly, stopping short, “Oh!” 
- “If you want to put it on the breakfast table with all 
the rest of her presents, it will have to be finished today,” 
said grandmother. 
“T could finish it when I come home,” said Polly, her 
voice sounding as if she were about to cry. 
“Perhaps you could, but perhaps you could not. Think 
how long it took you to make the leaves,” said grandmother. 
“Come on,” called Uncle John. 
“Tinkle, tink!” rang the sleigh bells. 
Dear me, what was a little girl to do? Polly looked at 
grandmother and at the little heap of work and out of the 
window at Uncle John; and then what do you think she 
did? 
Do you think she went sleighing? No, when Uncle 
Jobn drove away in his fine new sleigh with tinkling bells, 
no little girl narned Polly sat beside him. She was in grand- 
mother’s room sewing as fast as her needle could fly.

And when mother came down to breakfast on Christmas 
morning, the first thing she spied on the table was the 
needlebook. And, oh! how pleased she was! 
“Tt is the dearest’ Christmas present I have ever had,” 
she said. 
Polly had Christmas presents, too. Santa Claus had 
brought her a doll, Brother Tom had made her a doll house, 
and mother, father, and grandmother each had a gift for 
her; but I really believe the present she enjoyed the most 
was the one she herself made and gave to her mother.

Tue Farry’s New Year Girt 
Two little boys were at play one day when a fairy suddenly 
stood before them and said, “I have been sent to give you a 
New Year present.” 
She handed to each child a package and at the same 
instant was gone. 
Carl and Philip opened the packages and found the same 
thing in each — a beautiful book with white pages as pure, 
white, and beautiful as the snow when it first falls. 
After a long time, the fairy came again to the boys. “I 
have brought you each a new book,” she said, “and will take 
back the others to Father Time, who sent them to you.” 
“May I keep mine a little longer?” said Philip. ‘I 
have hardly thought about it lately. I’d like to paint some- 
thing on the last page that lies open.” 
“No,” said the fairy, “I must take it just as it is.” 
“T wish I could look through mine just once!” said Carl. 
“T have seen only one page at a time; for when a leaf turns 
over, it sticks fast, and I never can open the book at more 
than one place.”

. . PART ONE 55 
“You and Philip shall look over your books,” said the 
fairy. And she lighted for each of them a little silver lamp, 
by the light of which they saw the pages as she turned them. 
The boys looked in wonder. Could it be that these were 
the same fair books she had given them a year ago? Where 
were the pure white pages, as pure, white, and beautiful as 
the snow when it first falls? Here was a page covered with 
ugly black blots and scratches; while on the very next page 
was a lovely little picture. Some pages were decorated 
with gold and silver and beautiful colors, others with won- 
derful fiowers, and still others with a rainbow of the softest 
and most delicate brightness. Yet even on the most beautiful 
of the pages there were ugly blots and scratches. 
At last Carl and Philip looked up at the fairy. 
“Who did this?” they asked. “Every page was white as 
snow when we opened to it; yet now there is not a single 
blank space in the whole book!” 
“Shall I explain some of the pictures to you?” said the 
fairy, smiling at the two little boys. ‘See, Philip, the spray 
of roses blossomed on this page when you allowed the baby to 
have your playthings; and this pretty bird which looks as 
though it were singing with all its might would never have 
been on this page, if you had not tried to be kind the other 
day.” 
“But what makes this blot?” asked Philip. 
“That came,” said the fairy sadly, “when you told an 
untruth one day; and this when you did not mind your 
mother. All these blots and scratches, that look so ugly 
both on your book and on Carl’s, were made when you were 
unkind or thoughtless and did not obey your mother or 
father or your teacher. Each pretty thing in your books 
came on the page when you were good, and each blot when 
you were unkind or disobedient.” .

“That cannot be,” said the fairy. ‘See! they al

you can make these more beautiful than the others.’' 
So saying, she vanished, and the boys were left alone; 
but each held in his hand a new book open at the first page. 
On the front of this book was “1923.” It was the book 
of the New Year. — Emilie Poulsson.

Near by the lodge, one day, stood the beloved Princess of 
the tribe, watching the return of the warriors. She could 
see that they had many captives with them. 
One of the captives, a young Seminole brave, was brought 
into the lodge. He was to be nursed until his wounds were 
healed and then put to death. 
During his sickness he was pitied only by the Princess, 
who brought him water and medicines. A beautiful 
climbing rose that grew over the lodge comforted his heart. 
At last it was decided that the young brave should be 
put to death the next day. That night the Princess helped 
him plan his escape. But at the end he preferred death 
to going away without her, so greatly had he grown to 
love her. The Princess had grown to love him, too, so 
they decided to steal away from the camp together. 
Before they had gone far, the Princess was overcome 
with a longing to take something with her as a remembrance 
of her tribe. She slipped back and plucked a rose from the 
vine over her father’s lodge. With this in her*hand, she 
made the journey to the land of the Seminoles. 
Here she planted the slip from the rose-vine, and called 
it, in memory of her own people, the Cherokee Rose.

A Story or THe Frag 
It was the time of the year when flags were flying from 
all the public buildings in the town. There was a flag on 
the top of the town hall and a flag on the top of the school- 
house and a flag on the top of the post office. 
“I wish that I might have a red, white, and blue Ameri- 
can flag to carry and wave,’ Hubert said to his mother, 
who smiled and answered, ““You may have one when you 
have earned it, little son.” 
Hubert went out to try to find some way of earning one. 
The streets were full of people hurrying this way and 
that way. The soldiers were to march by in a long parade 
soon, and everyone was trying to find a good place to stand

and see them pass. Hubert found a place to stand 
curbstone, right at the edge of the road. 
Toot, toot! That was the sound of the trumpets. 
bum! That was the sound of the drums. The «

very well indeed. 
But just then he felt a soft touch on his arm. . He +--"-4 
and saw a very tiny boy who was not any taller th 
shoulder. 
“T can’t see; I can’t see at all, because you are ir 
of me,” said the tiny boy. 
Toot, toot! Bum, bum! The soldiers had reactk~4 ++- 
street corner. Hubert moved back and allowed t: 
boy to have his place on the curbstone. Then the 
pushed him farther and farther back until he could 
at all. The soldiers passed, but Hubert did not see | 
one. When he went home he told his mother all a 
“T have not, earned a flag yet,” he said. 
“But you were brave enough to give up seeing the sol- 
diers,” his mother answered. 
Then Hubert went into the pleasant room where hi 
grandfather sat in an armchair all day long. 
“This is a fine day, Hubert,’ his grandfather said 
“What do you want to make you very happy todev?” 
“YT want a red, white, and blue American flag ti 
and wave,” Hubert said. 
His grandfather took from his pocket a shinin; 
half dollar and put it into Hubert’s hand. 
“That is for you to buy a flag with,” he said, his eye 
twinkling through his spectacles. Hubert ran to his mothe 
with the money. 
“Now I can buy a flag,” he said. 
“Did you earn the money?” his mother asked.

Hubert looked up honestly into her eyes. “Grandfather 
gave me this money,” he said. “I have not earned my ~ 
flag yet.” 
“But you have been very truthful,” his mother answered. 
All day long Hubert was so busy that he did not have a 
minute in which he could try to earn the red, white, and 
blue flag. His mother asked him to go to the store and 
bring her a spool of thread; his: little brother, Gerald, was’ 
fretful and Hubert helped him build castles with his blocks; 
finally his grandfather called: “Come, Hubert, and sit 
with me until supper time. I am lonely.” 
Hubert sat beside his grandfather on a little stool all 
the rest of the afternoon and talked to him. When the 
day was over, he said to his mother in a sorrowful voice, 
“T have not earned a red, white, and blue flag.” 
“But you have been kind and helpful,” his mother said. 
Then she went to the corner shelf in her room, where 
she kept surprises, and brought out a beautiful silk Amer- 
. ican flag, with its red and white stripes and white stars on 
a blue ground. She put it into Hubert’s hands, saying, 
“It is your flag; you have earned it.” 
“How did I earn it, mother?” Hubert asked. 
Then his mother pointed to the colors of the flag, one by 
one, saying, “You were brave, and the red is your color; 
you were true, and therefore you earned the blue; you were 
good, and that is what a child must be if he wants to earn 
the white stars in the flag. You might have bought a flag 
with money, but it would not have been your own flag as 
this one is.” 
Hubert held his flag above his head and waved it as high 
as he could reach. It was his flag; red for being brave, 
blue for being truthful, and white for being good.

AARON AND THE BLUE Jays 
When I was a little girl, I had a large white cat: whose 
name was Aaron. He was not a pretty cat, but he was so 
clever that I know you will all like to hear about him. 
Aaron never jumped upon the table, and he liked best to 
eat from a fork. He thought it very nice to sit in my chair 
at dinner time, but he was usually sent to the kitchen because 
he talked too much and was not careful about keeping his 
paws in the right place. 
In summer he liked to lie on the walk in the sun, and 
sometimes he would climb to the top of the clothesline 
post and stay there until the blue jays drove him off. And 
I will tell you how they did it; it was great fun to watch 
them. 
They disliked Aaron, and I am afraid he was to blame 
for that, for he often tried to trouble their nests. The blue 
jays would be high up in the branches of a pine or an oak tree 
and as soon as Aaron began to get sleepy in the warm sun 
on the top of the post, down they would fly and peck his 
ears, flying away before he would have time to “meow.” 
There were two of these blue jays; first one, and then 
the other, would take a turn at pecking him, flying round 
and round just above his head, then back and forth from 
the trees to the house, until poor Aaron would become so 
excited and bothered he would lash his tail and “meow.” 
Often the birds would stop and sing or call to each other, 
and do you know what they seemed to say? I always 
thought one said, “He did it! He did it!” and the other 
answered, “Do it! Deo it!”’ and down they would swoop 
again and again.

Bird Robin is so very queer! 
He’s up before the peep o’ day, 
And when the quiet dark is here, 
And not a single bird is near, 
He'll stay, 
. And say, 
“Cheer up! Cheer up! Cheer up!” 
The other morning when ’twas dark 
I crept so softly down the stair, 
To beat: that robin. From the park 
There came a rustle; then, oh, hark! 
A-winging, 
Then singing, 
“Are you up? Are you up? You up?” 
And I stayed up very late, 
To see when robin went to bed; 
And just as our tall clock struck eight, 
And mother said, “Go now; don’t wait!” 
Bird laughter, 
And after— 
“Time’s up! Time’s up! Cheer up!” /

Aw Easter Surprise 
Mother watched Paul walk slowly up and down in front of 
the house. It was early in the springtime, so early that the 
birds had not yet come back from the South and the trees had 
no leaves, but the sun was warm and bright and seemed to be 
trying to tell the world that winter was over. By and by 
Paul sat on the sunny porch, wishing he had something to 
play with, so his mother gave him an old spoon and a flower 
pot full of sand. 
. Every year mother had a large bed of beautiful tulips. 
Paul did not know about the tulips, for he was only three 
years old; but he saw the big round place in the front yard 
where there was no grass, and it looked nice and soft to dig in. 
He emptied his pot of sand into his little wagon, and filled it 
up again with soft dirt from the tulip bed. Then he emptied 
it into his wagon. He did this over and over until the 
wagon was full.
-P-A-G-E-120
PART ONE ~ 103 
The long street was very quiet, and as nobody was in 
sight, the little boy walked slowly down to the corner. Just 
around the corner on the other side was a small house. It 
had a wee front yard, and right in the middle of it was a 
round flower bed. Paul walked into the yard and, sitting 
down on the ground, began to dig with a sharp stick that 
he had found. 
In his wagon were some round brown things that had been 
in the tulip bed. When Paul had made a little round hole 
in the flower bed, he put one of these brown things into it and 
covered it up. Then he made more round holes and put 
in all of the brown balls that were in his wagon. He did 
not know it, but the brown balls were tulip bulbs. 
That afternoon the old lady who lived in the little house 
sat looking sadly out of the window at her flower bed. “We'll 
have no flowers this year,” she thought. The little old man 
who made the flower bed every year was very, very ill. 
There were rainy days, and by and by a snowy one, and 
then more warm sunny ones. One happy day the little 
old man was better and the little old lady sat down for a 
moment’s rest. She happened to look out at the flower bed, 
and what should she see but something growing! 
“Tt must be weeds,” she said, but she put her shawl over 
her head and ran out to see. 
How her eyes did shine when she found not weeds, but a 
row of tulips almost ready to bloom! 
“Oh, oh, oh!” she cried, “how did they ever get there? 
What a beautiful surprise they will be for father!” 
On Easter Day the big easy-chair was pushed over by the 
window, and the little old man was to sit up in it for an hour. 
The little old woman could hardly wait until everything 
was ready for her to pull back the curtains to allow him 
to look out.

Tae Two GARDENS 
There were once two little boys named Bobby anc 
and they had two gardens. 
. Now Bobby and Robby looked as much alike as two peas. 
They both had blue gingham suits, and white hats with 
red ribbon streamers. They had fine new iron spades with 
shiny black handles, and strong little rakes as bright as silver. 
You could not have told one little boy from the other as 
they stood in their gardens one fine spring morning, leaning 
over the fence and talking together about the crops. 
“What are you going to plant, Robby?” asked Bobby. 
“Oh, a great many seeds,” said Robby, spreading out 
a number of seed packages. — 
“T shall plant beans,’ said Robby, “and also corn and 
watermelons and pumpkins and squashes and nasturtiums.
-P-A-G-E-128
PART ONE lil 
Those are the largest seeds in the packages, so of course 
they will take care of themselves. You see I have a great 
deal to do this summer, and I can’t waste all my time in 
the garden. I am going to build an automobile. What are 
you going to plant, Bobby?” 
Now Bobby had a paper of tiny, tiny black seeds that 
his grandmother had given him. They were so small that a 
breeze would have blown them away, but Bobby held them 
very tightly in his hand. His grandmother had said they 
were precious seeds. She said they would grow into flower- 
dresses for the fairies, if he tended them well. 
“T think I shall plant these little black seeds, Robby,” 
said Bobby. 
“Poof!” said Robby,‘ they won’t come up; they’re much 
too small. You may have some of my watermelons, though, 
Bobby, as soon as they are ripe.” 
Then Robby began to plant his garden very fast, in order 
to get through quickly. The corn he planted close together 
in long rows, though everyone knows that corn should be 
planted in hills, two or three feet apart. He put the cucumber 
seeds close to it on one side, and the watermelon seeds and 
the beans very close on the other side, while the squash, 
the nasturtium, and the pumpkin seeds he put in deep holes 
along the edge of the garden. Then he raked the earth 
over and ran off to the barn to put two wheels on a soap 
box, for that was to be his automobile. 
Bobby was busy, too. His grandmother had told him just 
how to plant the tiny black seeds. She said they must be 
scattered plentifully on the ground. Then the earth must be 
sifted, oh, so carefully over the top, or the precious seeds 
would be lost. Bobby planted them just as his grandmother 
had told him. 
Every morning Bobby went out to his garden and watered

it. There were a great many ugly weeds to pull ™ 
too busy even to look across the fence to see wha! |

Robby hadn’t had time to look in his own gard: 
You see when Robby found that the wheels would not. st: 
on the soap box without screws, he went down to the store 
buy a few. On the way home he met a boy with a kit 
Robby gave his jack-knife for the kite. It was a windy: 
and Robby flew his kite far over the fields, so far thu. | 
fell into a marsh, caught cold, and had to stay *- *~ * 
whole week. By the time he was well he had 
all about his garden. 
But Robby’s seeds had been busy all the tir:

finally the squashes and the watermelons. 
“This is my place in the garden,” said the corm, :

“No, it is our place,” said the beans. ‘We have nc 
to climb on, so of course we must run up your stalks.” 
“You shall do no such thing,” said the corn. 
All summer they quarreled and tangled themselves | 
tightly together that the beans were not able to grow az

way. After awhile they stopped altogether and just dried 
up. The squash vine went as far as the top of the garden 
gate, and then decided not to grow any squashes. 
One day, after a while, Robby thought he would go out 
into the garden and pick a watermelon for Bobby, a pumpkin 
for his mother to make into a pie, and some beans for supper. 
And Robby really did go— and you know what a state 
things were in! The weeds were nearly as high as his head 
and the vines caught his feet until he could hardly make 
his way over to the fence. When he looked into Bobby’s 
garden what do you think he saw? 
A garden full of poppies! There were red poppies as 
pretty as a sunrise cloud. There were yellow poppies as 
lovely as a sunset. There were pink poppies, too; enough 
to make dresses for all the fairies in fairyland. 
Robby looked back at his garden; it was almost a jungle. 
His nice new rake was all rusted from the rain, and his fine 
little spade lay on the ground with the handle broken in two. 
“Dear me!” said Robby. 
Bobby didn’t say anything. He just picked a big bunch 
of flowers and reached them over to Robby. 
“Thank you,” said Robby, and he sat down in the grass 
and just thought and thought and thought.

seashore. I’ll write tonight.” 
In less than a week grandfather was at the house, 
to take his grandson home with him. 
When Willie saw the big, blue ocean, his brown ey: 
opened wide in wonder. It was not long before the : ~ 
and sea bathing brought the roses back to the little 
cheeks, atid he was soon strong again. 
What fun he had playing in the sand! Such dee, 
and wells he dug, and fine houses and castles he built! ' 
often he wished that sister Sue could be with him! 
One day grandfather took Willie for a row. 
leaned over the side of the boat and looked at the 
shells, pretty pebbles, and little fishes in the water. 
He was just about to put out his hand to catch 
of seaweed floating by, when he felt.something pinch ] 
“Oh, oh!” he cried, “what’s that? There it is ju...

“Why,” said grandfather, looking in in the bottom 
boat, “it’s a crab!” and grandfather picked it up ‘by th: 
“He can’t hurt now.”

“What an ugly looking fellow!” exclaimed Willie. 
“Throw him overboard, please.” 
“Let’s look at him first,” said grandfather. “See, he has . 
eight legs and two claws or hands, one of which is much larger 
than the other and is very strong. With this claw he digs 
his house, gets his food, and pinches people.” 
“Digs his house?” laughed Willie. “Oh, grandfather!” 
“Yes, Willie, digs his house in the sand when the tide 
is low; and, more than that, he makes a long hall, a bedroom 
to sleep in, and a pantry for his food.” 
“What funny eyes the crab has!” cried Willie. “See 
how he pushes them out.” 
“His eyes are on little pegs which he can push in and out 
as he pleases,” said grandfather. 
“Is a crab a fish?” asked the boy. 
“Tt is called a shellfish,” said grandfather. “Baby 
crabs change their shells often because they grow so fast. 
Just like a boy I know,” and grandfather looked at Willie. 
“And now I think it must be so near dinner time that we 
must start for home,” said grandfather, as he headed the 
boat for shore. 
The summer passed quickly and one morning early in 
September, whom should Willie see coming up the road but 
father, mother, sister Sue, and the baby! How much he 
had to tell! Mother said that he was a real chatterbox. 
“Well, I see the roses are back,” said father, “and some- 
body is getting too big for his clothes. I wonder if my little 
boy is ready to go home?” — 
This was a hard question for Willie to answer. 
But when grandfather said he was to come again next 
summer and bring his sister with him, he was contented ta 
go home.

But Robin’s here, in coat of brown 
And ruddy breast-knot gay.

O Robin dear! 
Robin sings so sweetly 
In the falling of the year. 
Bright yellow, red, and orange, 
The leaves come down in hosts; 
The trees are Indian princes, 
But soon they'll turn to ghosts; 
The leathery pears and apples 
Hang russet on the bough; 
It’s autumn, autumn, autumn late, 
’Twill soon be winter now.

O Robin dear!

Appie-srmp JoHN 
Apple-seed John was a poor old man who wished to make 
other people happy. He made others happy with his kind 
words and helpful ways, but he wished to do still more. 
One day, while he was eating a nice red apple, he thought 
of a fine plan. After that, whenever he was paid for his 
work, he took part of his pay in apples. Every time he ate 
one of them, he would put the core in a large bag. 
When the bag was full, he took it on his back and walked 
toward the fields and meadows. Wherever he found a good 
place for an apple tree, he made a hole in the soft earth and 
planted an apple seed. 
When the bag was empty, he went back to work, saved 
more apple cores, and then went on planting as before. He 
continued doing this until he grew too old and weak to do 
itany more. It pleased him to think that what he had done 
would help to make others happy. 
As time went on, apple trees grew all over the country 
wherever John had gone. The birds made homes in their 
branches and the travelers were glad to rest in their shade. 
In the spring the pink and white blossoms filled the air with 
their fragrance, and in the fall the branches hung low with 
ripe fruit which seemed to say, “Pick me and eat me. Apple- 
seed John thought of you when he planted this tree.”

‘Silvercap lived far away in the north among the white, 
fleecy clouds. He spent all his time playing with his brothers 
and sisters. One day his father, King Winter, sent for him 
to talk over plans for a trip to Earth-land. 
Silvercap rushed into the palace, where he found his father 
sitting upon a beautiful crystal throne, with all his servants 
about him. 
“My son,” said King Winter, ‘‘you are to be king of the 
Frost Fairies. I want them to go to work at once, and 
you may plan what you will have them do.” 
After leaving his father, Silvercap spent the rest of the 
day in thought, but in the morning he called the Frost 
Fairies together and said: 
“My father has made me your king. West Wind has just 
returned from a trip to the Earth. He says he has killed 
the flowers, pulled the leaves from the trees, and driven the 
birds away. I am sure the little Earth-children are very 
unhappy. Let us go down and make them happy again.” 
That night the Frost Fairies flew down to Earth. They 
decorated the branches of the trees with lace. They covered 
every plant in the garden, even the weeds and grasses, with 
feathery blossoms. On the window panes of the rooms where 
the children were sleeping they built wonderful castles, high 
hills covered with silvery trees and rushing waterfalls, and 
fields with ferns and flowers and flocks of birds. 
The children were delighted when they awoke, and King 
Winter was so pleased with the work of the Frost Fairies 
that he made Silvercap King of Frostland. Every winter

Everything grew so well during the first summer that

a day on which to give thanks for their great harvest, and 
as they wished the Indians to share in their rejoicing, 
Squanto was sent to invite Massasoit and his braves. Every- 
one helped in the preparation for the feast. The men 
brought home deer and turkeys from the hunt, the boys 
brought fish and clams, and the women and girls were busy 
cooking. 
On Thanksgiving Day the Indians came at sunrise. After 
breakfast the Pilgrims went to church, and when the sermon

The flax was in full bloom. Its pretty, blue blossoms 
were as soft as the wings of a moth. The sun shone on it, 
the rain watered it, and it grew prettier every day. 
“People say that I am doing well and growing tall,” said 
the flax. “A splendid piece of linen will be made from me. 
Oh, how happy lam! How can anyone be happier? Every- 
thing around me is so pleasant, and I shall be of some use 
in the world. How the sun cheers one up, and how fresh and 
sweet the rain tastes! I am the happiest plant in the world.” 
“Yes, yes, yes!” said the stakes in the hedge. “That is 
all very well; but you don’t know the world as we do.” 
Then they creaked mournfully: |

every morning. The rain does me so much good th:.. _ 
see myself grow. I can feel that I am in blossom and I am 
to be of some use in the world. Who is so happy as I?” 
However, one day people came and pulled up the flax, 
root and all, and threw it into the water, as if they meant to 
drown it; after that they put it before the fire, as if they 
meant to roast it. : 
“One cannot always have pleasant times,” sighed the 
flax. “It is well to suffer sometimes; one learns to know 
what life is.” . 
But things got worse and worse. The flax was bruised 
and broken, hacked and hackled. At last it was put on the 
wheel. “Snurre-rur, snurre-rur!” went the wheel. The flax 
was so dizzy it could hardly think. 
“This is not pleasant,” sighed the flax; “but I have had 
happy times in the past. I must think of them, and be 
thankful for them.” The flax said the same thing when it 
was taken to the loom. 
There it was made into a large, fine piece of linen. All the 
flax was made into a single piece. “This is charming,” it 
said. ‘TI did not expect such good fortune. What nonsense 
the stakes used to talk when they said: 
‘Snip, snap, snurre, 
Bassilurre,

“The song is not done at all. It is just beginning. Life 
is pleasant, after all; I had to suffer, to be sure, but that is

Once I was very tiny and all covered over with a br-— 
coat. I had many brothers and sisters; we lived in 
sunny south, and were kept huddled close together _

One morning I heard the master say, “Tom, you maj 
plant the cotton seed today.” Cotton seed was my nam 
and I wondered if it were better to be planted than to bi 
tied up ina bag. But while I was thinking, Tom picked m 
up with the others, and I was soon put into a little bec 
close to a rolling river. 
Soon I began to feel larger and larger, until on | 
snug coat split and I popped right out of the ground. |

stretched my head higher and higher, and at last I ° 
three beautiful blossoms. I think I must have been vail 
all my beautiful petals left me, to go with Mr. Winc. 
mourned for them every day, but to my surprise the littl 
boils left by the blossoms burst and I was covered with 
cotton as white as snow and as soft as silk. 
“Come, children,” I heard Aunt Chloe call one day, “ 
must pick the cotton.” And the children did come - 7--~

grasp many little fellows dressed in brown coats. They 
looked just as I did before I went to sleep in Mother Earth. 
My next trip was in a bale. I was loaded on a big ship 
which sailed on a great sea. By and by the ship stopped. 
I was carried to a large house where I heard “buzz, buzz, 
buzz.” So many strange things happened to me that I won- 
dered what would be the end of it all. I was cleansed and 
twisted and spun and woven and bleached and at last found 
that I had become white cloth. 
My next journey was through a printing machine. At 
first I was white, but this machine sent me under a roller 
that left little bunches of red cherries all over me. Then 
I went under another roller that put green stems on the 
cherries and left green leaves close to the stems. A third 
roller left brown twigs, on which all the stems and leaves 
were to hang. Prettier bunches of fruit you never saw. 
One day a little country girl came into the store with a 
basket of eggs. She wanted to look at me, and just think! 
she gave the shopkeeper all of her eggs for eight yards of 
me. Then I was made into a dress with pretty ruffles at the 
neck and sleeves, and I gave much joy to the little girl, who 
always liked to wear dainty things.

When at last the summer ripens 
And the harvest is gathered in, 
And food for the drear, drear days to come -

They glean to the very least, 
To save till the cold December, 
For the sparrows’ Christmas feast. 
And then through the frost-locked country 
There happens a wonderful thing; 
The sparrows flock north, south, east, and west, 
For the children’s offering. 
Of a sudden, the day before Christmas, 
The twittering crowds arrive, 
And the bitter winter air at once 
With their chirping is all alive. 
They perch upon roof and gable, 
On porch and fence and tree; 
They flutter about the windows 
And peer in curiously. 
And meet the eyes of the children, 
Who eagerly look out; 
With cheeks that bloom like roses red, 
And greet them with welcoming shout. 
On the joyous Christmas morning, 
In front of every door 
A tall pole, crowned with clustering grain, 
Is set the birds before.

In Norway, many a year, 
I thought that our little children 
Would like to hear it, too,

So blessed a thing to do; 
To make God’s innocent creatures see 
In every child a friend, 
And on our faithful kindness 
So fearlessly depend.

Upon further inquiry, however, I found that they were 
only, temporarily his and that they were invited to a party 
at his house. He said he had been admiring them before 
I caniie up, and just wished he had a million dollars, and 
that:they were all his in reality. It was the prettiest sight

Yesterday afternoon three little girls walked into my 
room, each with a small basket. The eldest carried some 
fresh eggs, laid by her own hens; the second, some pickles 
made by her mother; the third, some popcorn grown in 
her garden. They were accompanied by a young maid 
with a block of soap made by her mother. The eldest of 
the girls, whose age did not exceed eight years, had a small

St. VALENTINE 
St. Valentine was a good priest who lived in Rome a 
great many years ago. His whole life was given to making 
other people happy. It was his custom to go from house to 
house feeding the poor, cheering the sad, and comforting the 
sick. He was especially fond of children, who gathered 
about him wherever he went. 
A pretty legend tells us that when he became too old and 
feeble to make his visits he was very unhappy until he 
thought of writing letters. After that, whenever he heard of 
anyone who was ill or in need or in sorrow, he would send a 
letter full of love and cheer. 
People began to look forward to these letters and they 
thought so much of them that after the good priest’s death 
his friends said, “Let us honor St. Valentine by sending 
letters on his birthday to those we love.” ‘These letters are 
called Valentines. — Selected. po Study of Story.

: . Our Fiac : 
During the Revolutionary War, the colonists wanted a 
flag of their own — different from any other flag. 
Axcommittee was appointed to decide upon a national 
flag.°-The committee consisted of George Washington, 
Colonel Ross, and Robert Morris. 
They decided upon red, white, and blue for the colors. 
Red is the symbol of courage; white is the symbol of truth 
and- ‘peace; blue is the symbol of loyalty and justice. The 
cma decided upon thirteen stripes, the original 
of states. The rest of the flag was very hard to 
pon. At last John Adams suggested that there be 
thie stars in the blue ground, one star for each state. 
ws were set in a circle, to show that they were without 
end, “The design was drawn by George Washington. 
‘Zhe first American flag was made by Mrs. Elizabeth 
Rots, of Philadelphia. She suggested that the stars should 
be given five points each instead of six. The flag was finished 
June 14, 1777, and adopted by Congress the same day. 
After the war new states were admitted into the Union, 
and for each state a new star and a new stripe were added. It 
was found that this plan would make the flag grow too large. 
So Congress decided that the flag should have thirteen stripes 
for the thirteen original states and that a new star should 
be added for each new state. We now have forty-eight stars.

JorEL CnanpLer Harris 
Joel Chandler Harris wrote his tales of ’Brer Rabbit 
and ’Brer Fox, because he loved the children he wrote them 
for. His home at Atlanta, Georgia, was made into a piay- 
ground for children, after his death, when it was bought 
by the Uncle Remus Memorial Association. He had 
named his house ‘“The Wren’s Nest,” because a wren had 
built her nest on the gate post as soon as it was set up, 
and the author of Uncle Remus would not allow the nest, 
to be disturbed. 
The inscription on Harris’s tomb is a sentence he wrote 
when he saw the pictures which the artist Frost had made 
for one of the Uncle Remus books. This sentence is: 
“T seem to see before me the smiling faces of thousands 
of children—some young and fresh and some wearing the 
friendly marks of age, but all children at heart—and not 
an unfriendly face among them. And while I am trying 
hard to speak the right word, I seem to hear a voice lifted 
above the rest, saying, ‘You have made some of us happy.’ 
And so I feel my heart fluttering and my lips trembling, 
and I have to bow silently, and turn away and hurry into 
the obscurity that fits me best.” 
The last part of this sentence shows what a wonderfully 
modest man Joel Chandler Harris was. He would never 
believe that he had done anything unusual in creating 
Uncle Remus and in telling his delightful animal stories. 
“It was just an accident,” he said. “All I did was to write 
out and put into print the stories I had heard all my life.” 
Of course he had heard the tales on the Southern plantation 
where he lived for a part of his boyhood, but the kindly

old darkey who tells the stories and the inquisitive little

Remus stories, and he composed several novels. All the 
time he was writing these books he continued to edit one 
of the best newspapers in the South, the Atlanta Constitution. |

Whistling with reeds on the broad river banks; 
Puffing the birds as they sat on the spray, 
Or the traveler grave on the king’s highway. 
Then it rushed like a monster o’er cottage and farm, 
Striking their inmates with sudden alarm; 
And they ran out like bees in a midsummer swarm. 
There were dames with their kerchiefs tied over their caps, 
_To see if their poultry were free from mishaps. 
“The turkeys all gobbled, the geese screamed aloud, 
And the hens crept to roost in a terrified crowd; 
There was rearing of ladders, and logs laying on, 
Where the thatch from the roof threatened soon to be gone. 
But the wind passed on, and had met in a lane 
With a schoolboy, who panted and struggled in vain, 
For it tossed him and twirled him, then passed, and he stood 
With his hat in a pool and his shoe in the mud.

very large family. There are many more rabbits than 
alligators.” 
“How foolish you are!” cried the alligator, angrily. “Why, 
there are thousands and thousands of alligators in the world! 
There are more than a hundred alligators in this swamp! 
Can you find a hundred rabbits in the woods?” 
“Certainly I can!” said the rabbit. “I'll count the alli- 
gators, and you may count the rabbits. Call the alligators 
together. Make a line of them across the swamp so that 
Ican hop out upon their backs and count them.” 
So the old alligator called and called. Up from the 
swamp came alligators, big ones and little ones. The old 
alligator made them into a line right across the swamp, just 
like a bridge. 
“Now count them, Friend Rabbit,” he said. “If there 
are not more than a hundred alligators here, you may eat 
me!” , 
The rabbit hopped upon the alligator-bridge. As he 
went from one to another, he counted them, “One, two, 
three, four, five,’ and so on up to a hundred. Yes! there 
were more than a hundred. 
But by the time he had counted the last alligator, of 
course the sly rabbit was on the other side of the swamp. 
“Tl call the rabbits together some other day, when I 
am not so hungry,” he called back to the old alligator. 
“Good-by! Who do you think is foolish now?” he said 
with a laugh. 
But the rabbit laughed too soon; for one of the alligators 
caught the end of the rabbit’s tail in his great jaws, and bit 
it off. 
Since then rabbits’ tails have always been short.

Easter Customs 
The custom of using eggs at Easter comes to us from very 
ancient times. The Persians gave colored eggs at their New 
Year, which they celebrated in the spring. The Hebrews also 
used eggs at the time of their feast of the Passover. 
The egg has always been regarded as a symbol of creation 
or new birth. Therefore, when people began to celebrate 
Easter they kept up the custom of using eggs. The Easter 
egg was generally colored red. 
People once believed that the joy bells went away for a 
week before Easter and came back Easter eve bringing colored 
eggs with them for the good children, and that these bells rang 
for joy Easter morning. 
The little German children believe that the white hare 
brings them their Easter eggs. In Russia, people send eggs 
to their friends on Easter Sunday. 
One of the Easter sights in Washington is the egg-rolling 
in the White House grounds. The children come to the park, 
each carrying a basket filled with eggs of many colors. They 
have a very happy time rolling eggs down the little hills. 
After a while the band comes out to play for the children and 
the President comes out to watch them.

Tue Lecenp or Tar ARBUTUS 
In the North Country there once lived an old, old man all - 
alone in his wigwam among the pine trees. His hair and 
beard were so long and so white that they covered him like a 
mantle. He wore a bearskin to keep himself warm, for all 
about his wigwam it was winter. The little brooks were 
locked fast under the ice, the wind cried in the trees, and 
not a squirrel or a blue jay was to be seen. The old man 
crouched over his fire and shivered because he was so cold. 
But one day there came through the woods a beautiful / 
maiden. Her cheeks were as pink as roses, her eyes were as ( 
soft and dark as the skies at twilight, and her hair was as 
brown as October’s nuts. The most beautiful thing of all was 
this: wherever she stepped on the frozen ground with her 
white slippers, the dew fell, and the sweet grasses and ferns 
grew again. 
She came to the old man’s wigwam. Her breath was as 
sweet as clover, and when she lifted the tent-flap it was no 
. longer cold inside, but warm and fragrant like a June day. 
“Who are you, and why do you come?” asked the old man. 
“Thave breathed on the woods and it is winter.” 
“When I breathe,” said the maiden, softly, “the flowers 
spring up.” 
“I shake my locks,” replied the old man, “and snow 
covers the earth.” 
“T toss my curls,” whispered the maiden, ‘and the warm 
rain falls.” 
“When I walk through the trees, the leaves fall, the squir- 
rel and the beaver hide, and the blue jays and wild geese 
fly south,” said the old man.

“When I come,” said the maiden, ‘the branches burst 
into leaves, the brooks sing, and the birds fly back again.” 
As the maiden spoke, the air in the wigwam grew warmer 
and warmer. Then the old man lay down upon the ground, 
for his eyes were heavy with sleep. The maiden knelt down 
beside him and rested her warm fingers on his forehead. 
And where the old man had lain there was, all at once, only 
a mass of green leaves. 
“T am stronger than the winter,” said the maiden. 
Then she took from her dress the loveliest pink and white 
flowers and hid.them under the green leaves. 
“T will give you, Arbutus, my most precious flowers and 
my sweetest breath,” she said, “but whoever picks you 
must kneel as I do.” 
Then the maiden floated away over the woods, the hills, 
and the plains; and wherever she went the flowers sprang up ' 
and spring came upon the earth.

By and by spring went away over the hilltops. The birds 
finished building their nests, and the butterflies and grass- 
hoppers came to announce the coming of summer. Then 
the soldier began to feel tired, and he knew that he -was 
growing old. His gay uniform had faded; and his golden 
arrows had changed to silver, and the wind fairies were 
shooting them far away. So the soldier crept down among 
the green grasses, and his little camp was left empty. 
But everywhere his arrows fell there blossomed, the next 
spring, bright golden flowers, and the children called them 
“dandelions.” — Selected.

“GOOD CITIZENSHIP” DISCUSSIONS 
The World War and the national problems of reeconstruc- 
! tion that have grown out of it place a new emphasis upon 
the need of high ideals of ‘“‘Good American Citizenship.” 
Every department of our schools can contribute to the 
building of these ideals; but the language period, through 
its oral and written composition work, affords a specially 
fitting opportunity for training American boys and girls to 
translate emotional patriotism into practical good citizenship. 
This Appendix suggests composition subjects of two 
kinds for this work: Part I outlines a lesson for discussion 
at the close of each half-year, based upon a summary of 
all the ideals of Good Citizenship that have appeared in 
the daily lessons within that semester; Part II (pages 275- 
288) supplies a list of supplementary subjects for discus- 
sion, dealing with practical qualities that form the basis of 
sound national character. q

‘We hear a great deal nowadays about making America

to be full of “Good Citizens,’ young and old, who lead 
the kind of lives that will help to make America a happy 
home for all.

Good Americans, whether in school or out of it, are 
those who work honestly, believe in service to others, 
avoid wastefulness, and in other ways show that they 
think of their neighbors’ welfare, instead of always think- 
ing selfishly how they can get more things for themselves. 
Turn back to the earlier pages of this book and sce 
how many of the selections and topics for discussion teach 
some lesson in ‘‘Good Citizenship.””. How do the schools 
of our country help to make good Americans? 
What qualities that every citizen should have can be 
found in Lesson 3? In Lesson 19? In Lesson 23? 
Make a list, which your teacher will write on the 
board, of all the good qualities for American citizens that 
are mentioned in the Lessons in this half-year. Can you 
add to this list some other qualities that have not been 
mentioned so far in your book? 
Similar lessons, based on the form outlined above, may 
well be used at the close of later half-year periods, follow- 
ing Lesson 147 (p. 127), Lesson 76 (p. 202), and Lesson 
149 (p. 268).

PART II 
SUPPLEMENTARY SUBJECTS FOR ORAL AND 
WRITTEN COMPOSITION 
The following subjects for oral and written composition, 
grouped according to theme, provide helpful material to 
supplement the lessons given in the text, or for use in the 
place of certain lessons in the book. 
For example, No. 1 may be used instead of Lesson 7, 
page 8, which introduces the subject of pets, or it may well 
follow it as a supplementary lesson. In some cases it may be 
found desirable to discuss a group of several connected topics 
as one lesson. These topics can be made the basis of oral 
discussion one day and followed the next day by written work. 
The arrangement of these subjects into two sections— 
Group One and Group Two—is flexible. Teachers should 
feel free to assign subjects listed in either part, when such 
topics have not already been used in another year. 
Although the plan for using the Supplementary Theme 
Subjects is flexible, and the teacher should feel free to draw 
upon them whenever occasion arises, Lessons in the text

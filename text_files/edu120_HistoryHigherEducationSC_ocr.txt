LETTER. 
DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, 
BuREAU oF Epucation, 
Washington, D. C., June 12, 1888. 
The Honorable the SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR, 
Washington, D. C.: 
Sir: The accompanying monograph, prepared by Mr. C. Meriwether, 
A. B., Johns Hopkins University, is designed to trace the history of 
higher education in South Carolina, his native State, and to give a 
sketch of the development of the free, or public school system. The 
earliest educational efforts are described, and instances are given illus- 
trating the interest of South Carolina, when yet a colony, in providing 
the means for the intellectual improvement of hersons. Far from being 
backward in education, the colony was especially alive to the necessity 
of mental development. Not only were schools founded and maintained 
in the province by the Government and through private and charitable 
aid, but many youths were sent to England for their education. The in- 
fluence of such men on their return was so great and lasting that, even 
to the middle of the present century, schools in Charleston, modelled 
on the English plan, were very popular. 
The birth of colleges was late and their growth slow; there was, 
therefore, chance for a good system of academies to develop. These | 
were planted in all parts of the State, so that a good training school 
was within the reach of all. The number continued to increase until 
the outbreak of the War. The training given in them was, in many 
cases, thorough and advanced. It was not unusual with some of them 
to prepare boys for admission to the Junior class of advanced colleges. 
The most famous academy was that presided over by Dr. Moses Wad- 
del, the Thomas Arnold of South Carolina. No other man in that 
State has taught boys who afterwards left their impress so deeply on 
the political history of the country. William H. Crawford, John C. 
Calhoun, and George McDuffie were trained by him. 
Although there is mention, in the House Journal of 1728, of a pro- 
posal to establish a college, and a bill was introduced into the colonial 
Legislature in 1769 for this purpose, yet no action was taken until the

present century. An act was passed in 1785 establishing three colleges 
in the State, yet only one of them ever gave collegiate instruction. 
The College of Charleston, while its foundation can be traced tu the 
legislative act of 1785, has given collegiate instruction only since the 
first quarter of the present century. It is supported very largely by 
income from vested funds, the result of endowment by public-spirited 
citizens in and near Charleston. Over half the three hundred thousand 
dollars endowment was given by Mr. Baynard, during the War, in 1864. 
The attendance has not been large, but the training in mathematics 
and ancient languages has always been thorough. 
Every denomination of any strength in the State has founded a col- 
lege. They cannot be called strictly sectarian colleges, since no re- 
ligious tests ar@ required of any of the students. In the main they 
follow the average college course, but, owing to want of funds, they 
cannot offer very many electives. It is gratifying to state that the 
funds and attendance of nearly all of them are gradually increasing. 
All of them, except Wofford College at Spartanburg, are the result of 
the small gifts of the church members. Wofford College is due to the 
beneficence of one man, Benjamin Wofford, a Methodist minister. At 
the time of his bequest, in 1850, it was probably the largest amount ever 
given by a southern man for educational purposes. The War was most 
disastrous to all these institutions in sweeping away their endowments. 
The various denominations haye established female schools of a fair 
grade. § 
The first attempt made to establish a general system of free schools 
wasin 1811. The act was passed after bitter opposition on the part of 
some of the up-country members, and provided free instruction for all 
children, but gave the preference to poor children. It did not contain 
a provision for a supervising officer of the whole system, like the pres- 
ent Superintendent of Education. These mistakes were an insuperable 
bar to success; and although the annual appropriations were doubled in 
1852, being made seventy-four thousand dollars, yet the universal testi- 
mony was that the schools were a failure. On the adoption of a new 
State Constitution in 1868, the present public school system was intro- 
duced. Its usefulness has been greatly increased by the efficient man- 
agement since 1876. 
The attention paid by the State to the education of the colored citi- 
zens is well illustrated in Claflin University, supported largely by the 
State. It has seventeen teachers and six courses of instruction, and its 
students at the last session numbered nine hundred and forty-six. It is 
the largest and one of the best colored schools in the South. 
The most important phases of advanced instruction in South Carolina 
are those connected with the State institutions. The Military Academy 
at Charleston was designed to furnish trained soldiers for South Caro- 
lina. It receives an annual appropriation of twenty thousand dollars 
for the support of sixty-eight beneficiaries. Its course is modelled after 
that of West Point.

  LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL. 5 
The College of South Carolina is the best of all the institutions in 
the State. It was opened for students in 1804, and has ever since ex- 
ercised a strong influence on the politics of South Carolina, except dur- 
ing the reconstruction period. Every politician of any note in the 
State, except John C. Calhoun, has been for a time connected with the 
institution. Thomas Cooper, one of the presidents of the college, sup- 
plied the free traders with materials for their attacks upon the tariff. 
One of the greatest political philosophers of America, Francis Lieber, 
did his work and made his reputation during a sojourn of twenty years 
at Columbia, S. C. These two men were the greatest scholars connected 
with the institution, and their reputation has carried its name and 
fame far and wide. Owing to the generosity of the Legislature in ap- 
propriating thirty-seven thousand dollars for the support of the college, 
the corps of instructors has been increased, departments have been 
added, and the whole outlook is more promising than ever before. 
In the preparation of this paper, the library collections of the Bu- 
reau of Education in Washington have been extensively used. Special 
acknowledgments for assistance are due President McBryde and Pro- 
fessor R. Means Davis, who supplied much manuscript material; to G. 
KE. Manigault, M. D., of the College of Charleston, and Professor H. 
T. Cook and President Charles Manly of Furman University; to Pres- 
ident James H. Carlisle and Prof. F. C. Woodward, of Wofford College; 
to John F. Calhoun, a great-nephew of John C. Calhoun, for aid in the 
history of the Willington Academy, under Moses-Waddel; to Hon. 
William A. Courtenay; to Gen. Edward McCrady, Jr.; to Gen. Geo. D. 
Johnston; and to many others who kindly gave the author sugges- 
tions and information. Valuable facts were also derived from a pri- 
vate memoir of Paul Hamilton, through whose able administration of 
finances it became possible for the State to found the University. 
I respectfully recommend the publication of this monograph, which 
is one of the series prepared by the Bureau of Education. 
Very respectfully, yours, 
N. H. R. Dawson, 
Commissioner of Education.

HISTORY OF HIGHER EDUCATION IN SOUTH CAROLINA. 
CHAPTER I. 
EARLY EDUCATION IN THE COLONY. 
After the unsuccessful efforts of the French to establish themselves 
in Carolina, came the English, a people fitted by nature to rule and to 
colonize. They came over when Milton and Barrow, Locke, Tillotson, 
and Watts were still living, and the first struggles of the young colony 
were nearly contemporaneous with the founding of the Royal Society 
of London. Though there were no men among them eminent in the 
world of letters or of science, yet there were some who appreciated 
learnizg. : 
As soon as the founding of the colony was accomplished, the colonists 
turned their attention to providing educational facilities for the coming 
generation. It was nearly thirty years after their first arrival and set- 
tlement on the Ashley that we have any account of their organized 
efforts in a literary way. In 1698 or earlier, a law was passed for ‘“se- 
curing the provincial library of, Charleston.”! After this libraries 
were founded in nearly all the parishes, but they were chiefly limited to 
the use of the ministers. The chief promoter of all this movement 
was Dr. Bray, of Charleston. Religious societies, which have always 
been one of the most important factors in the diffusion of knowledge in 
nearly all places, were also active in the movement in South Carolina. 
The Society for Propagating the Gospel in Foreign Parts, with head- 
quarters in London, was especially active in promoting the cause of the 
libraries. Tinally the Assembly brought their management under a 
central control, and appointed commissioners to take charge of all the 
various libraries and attend to the lending of books. 
If anything was done for establishing schools before 1710, the rec- 
ords of such action are lost, though an act of that year recited that 
gifts had already been made for founding a free school. The acts of 
1 Ramsay’s History of South Carolina, p. 353. 
: 13
-P-A-G-E-14
14 z HIGHER EDUCATION IN SOUTH CAROLINA. 
1710 and 1712, providing for a free school at Charleston, may be con- 
sidered the earliest authentic record on the subject of schools in South 
Carolina. The preamble set forth “the necessity that a free school 
be erected for the instruction of youth in grammar and other arts and 
sciences, and also in the principles of the Christian religion; and that 
several well disposed Christians by their last will had given several sums 
of money for the founding of a free school.”! It was then provided among 
other things, that the preceptor “‘should be of the religion of the 
Church of England and capable of teaching the Latin and Greek lan- 
guages.” THis salary of one hundred pounds yearly was to be paid 
out of the public treasury. In return for the free use of the lands and 
buildings of the school, he was to teach twelve scholars free, but to 
charge all others four pounds each per annum. Provision was also 
made for an usher, and a master to “teach writing, arithmetic, mer- 
chants’ accounts, surveying, navigation, and practical mathematics.” 
It was also enacted “ that any schoolmaster settled in acountry parish, 
and approved by the vestry, should receive ten pounds per annum 
from the public treasury ;” and the vestries were authorized to draw 
from the same source twelve pounds towards building aschool-house in 
each of the country parishes. 
Here a general plan was formulated for the whole colony, but no 
provision was mace for a central supervision, But during the same 
time the Church was erecting and managing schools. The missionaries 
addressed a letter to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in 
Foreign Parts, and described the condition of the colony as in want of 
sufficient education. The Society heard the appeal and established a 
school in Charleston in 1711, under the care of the Rev. William Guy, 
A.M. It sent out missionaries, not only to preach, but “ to encourage 
the setting up of schools for the teaching of children.” Their school- 
masters were enjoined to ‘take especial care of the manners of the 
pupils in and out of school; warning them against lying and falschood 
and evil speaking ; to love truth and honesty; to be modest, just, and 
affable; to receive in their tender years that sense of religion which 
may render it the constant principle of their lives and actions.” 
{t was not to be expected that the proprietary governors would urge 
the subject very closely upon. the attention of the people, since the Con- 
stitution of John Locke contained not one word on the subject of edu- 
cation, though it did contain many foolish provisions forbidding law- 
yers, commentaries, and legal reports, and compelling a man to worship 
some Deity publicly or be driven from the colony, and giving the mas- 
ter absolute power over his slave. But the first royal Governor, Sir 
Francis Nicholson (1721-1724), was a great friend to learning, and un- 
der his influence many legacies were left to the schools. The private 
contributions and donations about this time, and for a few years later, 
were remarkably large for so small and weak a colony, its population

in 1734 being only 7,333, As one instance among many it may be men- 
tioned that Mr. Whitemarsh gave five hundred pounds to found a school 
in St. Paul’s Parish. Other gifts also resulted in the establishment of 
schools, some of which are sketched in the following pages. 
“BERESFORD BOUNTY” SCHOOL. 
Richard Beresford gave six thousand five hundred pounds for the 
advancement of ‘liberal learning” and for charity. This is the only colo- 
nial endowment still in healthy existence. The following interesting 
account by one of the present managers of the fund shows the carefal 
management of this bequest from colonial times to the present, nearly 
two centuries : 
“One of the earliest bequests for the education of the poor in South 
Carolina was made by Richard Beresford. We left England with his 
parents in early childhood, and, after a few years in Barbadoes, removed 
permanently with them to Carolina in 1680, 
“ Both he and his father became prominent in the affairs of the colony, 
and the son was so highly esteemed that many honors were conferred 
upon him at various times by the Commons House of Assembly of 
the province. The bulk of his landed property was situated in the 
Parish of St. Thomas and St. Denis, near Charleston, and at his death, 
in 1722, he left the sum of £6,500 currency in trust to the vestry of the 
Episcopal Church of the parish, for the maintenance and education of 
the poor children of said parish. 
“Tor many years the income from this bequest was not sufiicient to 
earry out fully the wishes of the testator, but gradually, as the princi- 
pal increased, a large number of poor children of both sexes were well 
cared for and educated, in a capacious school-house erected for the 
purpose, the rector of the parish being the principal of the school, but 
the work of instruction being done by the assistant rector, with his 
wife as matron. 
“This continued until the Revolution, and there were as many as 
thirty scholars at one time in the school, the total assets of the bounty 
fund having reached £10,000 sterling. The capital was reduced by the 
general bankruptcy that followed, but, by careful management, from 
1783 to 1861 the fund had accumulated again to about $70,000, which 
included the value of the school-house and rectory. 
“The history of the management of the fund did great credit to 
* the successive vestrics in whose care it had been, and the total num- 
ber of children who were clothed, housed, and educated during those 
many years was large. The disastrous ending of the Civil War to 
the South resulted in another diminution of the principal, and, at 
present, the entire assets amount to over $20,000. 
“The parish at present has lost much of its former population, and 
the Legislature has relieved the vestry from the necessity of housing,

boarding, and clothing the children, but instruction is still given in the 
school-house, a large building at the village of Cainhoy on the Wando 
River, the rector of the parish being the principal, and the work being 
done by an assistant.” 
THE DOWNER INSTITUTE. 
Another charitable school, while not so old as the preceding, was 
founded by Alexander Downer, an Englishman, in 1818. He was a 
member of the “ Seceders,” and the following account of the manage- 
ment of the fund is given by the present custodian, Mr. E. S. Ham- 
mond : 
“Mr. Alexander Downer, I have been told, was an Englishman, who 
cainc to this country very young, prior to the Revolutionary War. Two 
clauses from his will furnish somewhat of his history, as well as ex- 
plain his intentions: ‘I give and bequeath to such of my blood relations 
as can prove themselves so one hundred cents each, if called for in due 
ume. Having been myself an orphan and having received a partial edu- 
eation at the Orphan House in Georgia, by which I have learned how to 
estimate the value of an education, and by which I have been able to 
obtain a sufficiency to support myself, my wife, and seven orphan chil- 
dren which I have raised, I do now feel an inclination and am willing to 
dispose of the balance of my estate for the benefit of the orphans of 
Edgefield District” To this end he left three hundred acres of land and 
the proceeds from the disposal of twelve negroes and the balance of his 
personal estate to the establishing a school for orphans under fourteen 
years of age, one-fourth to be taken from Richmond County, Ga., and 
the balance from Edgefield District. About 1846 a school was estab- 
lished, the fund, though it had met several mishaps, Having accumu- 
lated to about $20,000, in addition to a fine institute building, and about 
fifty acres of land, which continued in successful operation until inter- 
rupted by the War. Fifty orphans enjoyed its benefit during that 
period. The close of the War found the treasurer and securities, who 
were gentlemen of large wealth, insolvent, as were also all those who 
had received loans of the institute funds; the building was in need of re- 
pairs. Owing to the condition of affairs during the period of reconstruc- 
tion, no inquiries were made or steps taken to secure any assets there 
might be. In 1878 the Legislature appointed a referee to look into the 
affairs of the fund and adjust them to the best advantage that could be, 
which adjustment has only this year been brought to a close, the fund 
at this time amounting to about $6,500.” 
OTHER SCHOOLS.

bequests made for educational purposes from the earliest times to a

the only ones. There were the Mount Zion, the St. David’s, and the 
Camden Orphan Societies, the Cheraw Lyceum, the Ludlam Fund, the 
early free schools at Childsbury and Dorchester, and many others. 
In 1733 James Childs gave six hundred pounds for a school at Childs- 
bury. The inhabitants realized that this was a very small sum for 
founding a school and instantly resolved to increase it by subscrip- 
tion. Very quickly £2,200 additional were raised. 
Some of these schools were erected in retired, in some cases, romantic 
places. The one at Childsbury was “ just by a romantic little church, 
with its graveyard and solemn grove of live-oaks, from whose large and. 
shading branches large masses of gray moss hang with almost archi- 
tectural arrangement, picturing to the fancy of the classical enthusiast 
Gothic arches and festoons and all the variety of tapestry and orna- 
ments.” 
In 1734 an act was passed for erecting a school for children at Dor- 
chester, since “ their parents are so well inclined to have them instructed 
in grammar and other liberal arts and sciences, and other useful learn- 
jng,” and their circumstances did not permit of their sending the chil- 
dren to Charleston to the free school there. It was provided “ that the 
master of said school shall * * * teach the learned languages, 
Latin and Greek tongues, and * * * catechise and instruct the 
youth in the principles of the Christian religion.” 
These schools received the fostering care of the government, and were 
favored in the taking up of lands, and further assisted by donations. 
These corporations formed a centre for the donations and bequests of the 
charitable. ‘From the triple source of tuition money, public bounty, 
and private donations, a fund was created which diffused the means of 
education far beyond what could have been accomplished by uncombined 
exertions conducted without union or system.” 
CHARLESTON LIBRARY SOCIETY. 
As illustrating the early efforts of the colonists to farnish facilities for 
education in a broad sense of the term, the history of the Charleston 
Library Society is interesting. This organization owes its origin to 
seventeen young gentlemen, who associated in 1748 for the purpose of 
raising a small fund to collect pamphlets and buy the current issues 
of the English magazines. Their views enlarged, and on December 
28th of that year they formed a library society and made arrangements 
for getting books also. As they gradually increased their collection 
valuable additions were made by wealthy members depositing rare 
and costly volumes. On the outbreak of the War this slow growth 
ceased, and in 1863 it was thought safest to remove the books to 
Columbia, where they were deposited in the buildings of the State Uni- 
versity. Fortunately these rare treasures escaped the general destruc- 
tion of libraries in the State, and on the re-organization of the society

in 1866 they were returned to Charleston; but the building was in a 
dilapidated condition, the funds of the society were lost, and the wealth 
of its members destroyed. Indeed, very few were able to do more than 
pay the annual dues. By unwearied exertions the building was refitted, 
the debts paid off, and the subscriptions renewed. In 1874 the Appren- 
tices’ Library Society, which was organized in 1824, united with the older 
association. The prospects of this united society. are now very bright; 
the volumes number nearly twenty thousand, and the annual income 
from various sources is over two thousand dollars.! 
WORK OF THE DIFFERENT DENOMINATIONS. 
But while the State and private persons were establishing schools and 
promoting the cause of education, the various charitable and religious 
societies were not idle. They not only labored in the centres, but carried 
their work to the farthest outposts. The Presbyterians in the upper 
part of the State and the Church of England in the lower part placed 
the means of education within reach of all. 
The Presbyterian Church has always been among the foremost de- 
nominations in advancing the cause of education in this country, and 
was not laggard in upper South Carolina. The women especially 
valued an education “beyond all price in their leaders and teachers; 
and erayed its possession for their husbands and brothers and sons.” 
‘Almost invariably, as soon as a neighborhood was settled, prepara- 
tions were made for preaching the Gospel by a regular stated pastor; 
and wherever a pastor was located, in that congregation there was a 
classical school.”” 
Toward the middle of the century the Baptists exerted themselves in 
the movement for providing the means of education. “Among the dif- 
ferent sects of Christians in South Carolina, none have made earlier 
or greater exertions for promoting religious knowledge than the Bap- 
tists.”° They formed an association in Charleston in 1752. In 1755 
several of the members formed a society for “improvement in Christian 
knowledge,” and the general committee provided for the education of 
students preparing for the ministry, and furnished a library for their 
use. The Independents also did something for the cause, but as they 
have never been strong in the State, of course they did not establish so 
many schools as other denominations. 
EARLY CHARITABLE SOCIETIES. 
There were several charitable societies in the early period that were 
active in providing for the education of orphans and the indigent.

EARLY EDUCATION IN THE COLONY. 19 
South Carolina Society, founded in 1737, for the free education of the 
indigent of both sexes, had funds to the amount of $137,000 by the 
opening of the following century. The Fellowship Society was inau- 
gurated in 1769 to care for the lunatics. One of the most important of 
all these societies was the 
WINYAW INDIGO SOCIETY AT GEORGETOWN, 
founded for improving the cultivation of indigo—one of the chief sta- 
ples at that time—and for educating the poor. But it extended its 
work beyond that of a charity school, and for over “a hundred years 
was the chief school for all the eastern part of the country between 
Charleston and the North Carolina line, and was resorted to by all 
classes.” 
Tradition relates its organization in the following entertaining way: 
“The planters of Georgetown district, about the year 1740, formed 
a convivial club, which met in the town of Georgetown on the first 
Friday of each month, to talk over the latest news from London, which 
was never less than a month old; to hold high discourse over the 
growth and prosperity of the indigo plant, and to refresh the inner 
man, and so keep up to a proper standard the endearing ties of social 
life by imbibing freely of the inevitable bowl of punch. From the ini- 
tiation fees and annual contributions it came to pass that about the 
year 1753 the exchequer became plethoric of gold, and the hearts of 
our founders overflowed with the milkof human kindness. * * #* 
And hence it became the question of the hour, to what good purpose 
shall we devote our surplus funds? As the tale runs, the discussion 
was brief, pertinent, and solid. At the close of it the presiding officer 
called on the members to fill their glasses, he wished to close the de- 
bate by a definite proposition ; if it met their approbation, each mem- 
ber would signify it by emptying his glass. He said: ‘There may be 
intellectual food which the present state of society is not fit to partake 
of; to lay such before it would be as absurd as to give a quadrant to 
an Indian; but knowledge is indeed as necessary as light, and ought 
to be as common as water and as free as air. It has been wisely or- 
dained that light should have no color, water no taste, and air no odor ; 
so indeed, knowledge should be equally pure and without admixture of 
creed or cant. I move, therefore, that the surplus fandsin the treasury 
be devoted to the establishment of an independent charity school for the 
poor” The meeting rose to its feet. The glasses were each turned 
down without soiling the linen, and the Winyaw Indigo Society was 
established. Such, in brief, was the origin of a society whose school 
has been the school for all the country lying between Charleston and 
the North Carolina line for more than one hundred years. In its in- 
fancy it supplied the place of primary school, high school, grammar 
school, and collegiate institute. Therich and the poor alike drank from
-P-A-G-E-20
20 HIGHER EDUCATION IN SOUTH CAROLINA. 
this fountain of knowledge, and the farmer, the planter, the mechanic, 
the artisan, the general of armies, lawyers, doctors, priests, senators, 
and governors of States, have each looked back to the Winyaw Indigo 
Society as the grand source of their success or their distinction. To 
many it was the only source of education. Here they began, here they 
ended thav disciplinary course which was their only preparation for the 
stern conflicts of life.”! 
The following account by Dr. Manigault, who is most conversant 
with its affairs, gives the subsequent history of the society-school: 
“Tn South Carolina during the colonial period, and for many years 
afterwards, most of the customs and prejudices prevailed which were 
peculiar to England, and which were brought over with them by the 
steady flow of English settlers. This should be borne in mind in order 
to fully appreciate the situation in that State, especially in the matter of 
education. This was by no means universal and free in the last century 
in England, and it is only quite recently that provision has been made 
there for it to be compulsory among the children of the poor, who are 
either unable to defray the expense or indifferent to its advantages. 
South Carolina therefore was slow to adopt the modern views about edu- 
cation, and always has had a proportion of illiteracy among her whites. 
It is only since the State has undertaken the education of all classes 
without distinction that illiteracy has begun to diminish in amount. 
‘““Hducation previous to the State’s interference was generally paid 
for by those who profited by its opportunities, although there are many 
striking instances in the history of the State of poor boys having been 
educated either as beneficiaries or through the agency of friends, who 
afterwards became distinguished in the professions. 
“Most persons who were able to do so sent their sons to England for 
their education, and the absence of a college previous to the Revolution 
is easily accounted for when this fact is known. But that those par- 
ents who were able to send their sons away were not unmindful of the 
duty which they owed to the public, of assisting in the education of 
their poor neighbors, is fully proved by the existence of such schools 
in almost every parish of the sea-board of the State, which were more 
the centres of population in the last century than now. The only two 
endowments which have survived the events of that long period are 
the Beresford Bounty Fund and that of the Winyaw Indigo Society, 
although the latter association has only been able to save its school- 
house. 
“The Beresford Bounty Fund illustrates the philanthropy of only one 
person, whereas the Winyaw Indigo Society evidences the farsighted- 
ness of a number of prosperous indigo planters. It appears that their 
society was first started for convivial purposes, and the dues of mem- 
bers were paid in indigo. This, when sold, realized so handsomely, 
that after defraying the expenses of the monthly gatherings, there was   
1 Rules of the Winyaw Indigo Society. Charleston, 1874. 
 
-P-A-G-E-21
  
\ 
EARLY EDUCATION IN THE COLONY. 23 
a considerable balance left. The society maturely considered the pur- 
pose to which this balance should be devoted, and it was unanimously 
decided that it should be spent in the education of a limited number of 
poor children of the neighborhood. This occurred in 1756, which is the 
date of the founding of the school, and for over a century, until 1861, 
there was an annual average of about twenty-five children educated by 
the society. The present principal of the school, Mr. A. McP. Hamby, 
states that after a careful examination of one of the treasurer’s state- 
ments of about the last named year, he accounts for an invested capi- 
tal of $14,640, bearing perhaps seven per cent. interest, the school build- 
ing and grounds being now worth ten thousand dollars. The annual 
dues of members added largely to the available income, and thus it can 
be understood how the poor children were maintained as well as edu- 
cated. 
« Some years after the school had been in operation the trustees al- 
lowed the principal to receive fifteen pay scholars, for whose teaching 
he was paid $600, in addition to his regular salary of $1,000; and, if 
as many as fifteen more applied for admission, an assistant was then 
employed at a salary of $600. 
“The institution thus became an important grammar and classical 
school, on account of the efficiency of its teachers, and was patronized 
by the people of a large area of country. After the Civil War the in- 
vested funds became valueless on account of the general bankruptey 
that followed, and the school building in Georgetown was occupied for 
over a year by the Federal garrison. It was during this occupancy 
that its library was scattered, and the books have never been recovered. 
“When the society were allowed the possession of their building 
again, they raised the sum of two thousand dollars as a nucleus of a 
new endowment. A part had to be spent in repairs, and the balance 
was gradually absorbed in making up deficiencies in the teachers’ salaries. 
There was therefore no other alternative, and the school was made a 
graded school and incorporated as one of the public schools of the State. 
This occurred in 1886, and for twenty years previously an annual average 
of about ten poor children were educated by the society.” 
EARLY PRIVATE SCHOOLS. 
But these free, charity, and religious schools were not the only ones. 
A large part of the education was done by private schools and academies. 
And besides, many with families kept tutors trained in the universities 
of Europe for the education of their sons. All through the years down 
to the Revolutionary War, as the country was settled, schools were 
founded. Among the large number was one in the Waxhaw settlement, 
which Andrew Jackson attended, and another on the Tiger River, said 
to have been presided over by a kinsman of the present Gen. Wade 
Hampton, Although Jackson is generally considered an illiterate man,

yet there is evidence to show that his ignorance was partly an affecta- 
tion, Parton says he attended some of the better schools of the coun- 
try, which were kept by clergymen of intelligence, who taught the 
languages in their schools. 
EDUCATION IN THE COLONY. 
During the Revolution, the efforts in the cause of education did not 
cease entirely. Rev. George Howe gives an account of the formation of 
the Mount Zion Society for educational purposes the year after the battle 
of Fort Moultrie. The preamble commences with a quotation from 
Isaiah: Lx, 1: “Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the 
Lord is risen upon thee.” This shows their hope and courage in the 
midst of the conflict. Its members were scattered over the State, and 
for this reason the meetings were to be held in Charleston. The school 
was probably continued until Lord Cornwallis occupied Winnsborough, 
in 1780. In 1783 the society met, re-organized, received new members, 
accepted donations of lands, and re-opened the school as a college under 
the act of incorporation passed in March, 1785.) 
A Catholic society was incorporated in 1778 “for the purpose of 
founding, endowing, and supporting a public school in the district of 
Camden.”? 
Another society was started in St. David’s Parish. This society, 
St. David’s, was organized ‘purposely for founding a public school in 
said parish for educating youth in the Latin and Greek languages, 
mathematics, and other useful branches of learning.” 
In these various ways schools were founded over the entire colony, 
and the work was not checked even by the Revolutionary War. At the 
close of the war, there were twenty-two grammar schools in the province.’ 
In many of these, if not in all, instruction was given in Latin, Greek, 
and mathematics. But away out on the very frontier of the province, 
and where the country was sparsely settled, it was impossible to keep 
up schools for these subjects. The knowledge of the people was de- 
rived from the Bible chiefly, and what stray papers they could get, 
and “having but little to read, they read that little well.” But this 
simple means of education was of great value to them. From the Bible 
they could get material for theological discussion, ‘ moral philosophy, 
‘ancient manners and customs.” From newspapers and orations, they 
obtained ideas of government, and knowledge of the improvements in 
the arts and sciences, and of the present state of the world. 
The qualifications for teachers were high for that time. The act of 
1712 provided that they should be capable of teaching the Latin and

of the society is reprinted in full in Appendix III of this work.

    Greek languages. The teachers in the upper part of the State, which 
was not settled until the middle of the eighteenth century, were usually 
Presbyterian clergymen, and, in consequence, men of liberal education ; 
“some were excellent arithmeticians, and read and wrote Latin flu- 
ently.” Further, their duty often required them to draw wills and 
titles to lands, and make all difficult calculations. But the strongest 
testimony for the advantages offered in the province is given by Dr, 
Ramsay, who says: “The knowledge of grammar and of the Latin and 
Greek languages, and of mathematics, could be obtained in Carolina at 
any time after 1712, or the forty-second year subsequent to the settle- 
ment of the province.” ! 
During the years before the Revolution, that a good education could 
be obtained in the province is seen from the fact that Charles Pinckney, 
the eminent lawyer, statesman, and classical scholar, and Edward 
Rutledge, the brother of John Rutledge (second Chief-Justice of the 
United States), and Dr. Wells, who “promulgated the first comprehen- 
sive theory of dew,” were all educated within the province, and at 
Charleston. 
While there was no general school system for the whole province 
under the authority of the government, yet, through the charitable and 
religious schools, and such free schools as were founded by the govern- 
ment, the means of education were placed within reach of all. There . 
were no colleges, it is true, but the instruction given in the grammar 
schools was probably as advanced as that given in some colleges of the 
period. Some of the academies of to-day are far more thorough than 
many so-called colleges and universities. The nature of the education 
given in the colleges of that period is seen in the following quotation: 
“The four years of residence at college were spent in the acquisition of 
Latin and Greek, a smattering of mathematics, enough of logic to 
distinguish barbara from celarent, enough of. rhetoric to know climax 
from metonymy, and as much of metaphysics as would enable one to 
talk learnedly about a subject he did not understand.” ? 
The main stress in these colleges was laid on the study of Latin and 
Greek, and both tongues were provided for in the grammar schools in 
South Carolina; yet, in spite of all this, the author of the popular History 
of the People of the United States, stated, it is to be feared, without sufti- 
cient examination, that “in the Southern States education was almost 
wholly neglected, but nowhere to such an extent as in South Carolina. 
In that colony, prior to 1730, no such thing as a grammar school ex- 
isted. Between 1731 and 1776 there were five. During the Revolution 
there were none.”? He gives the chief historian of South Carolina as 
his authority, Dr. Ramsay, who wrote a chapter on the literary and 
educational features of the State. At the end he summarized, but sum- 
    
‘Ramsay, Vol. II, p. 358, 2McMaster, Vol. I, p. 27.
-P-A-G-E-24
  24 HIGHER EDUCATION IN SOUTH CAROLINA. 
marized incorrectly. Mr. McMaster contented himself with the summary. 
If he iad only devoted a few moments to the preceding pages of the 
chapter he would have seen that Dr. Ramsay himself had contradicted 
his own summary. Dr. Ramsay’s testimony is very clear that the in- 
terests of education were not neglected in the early years of the prov- 
ince; for he shows that the young colony, as soon as it was firmly es- 
tablished, ‘“‘adopted measures for promoting the moral and literary 
improvement of themselves, and particularly of the rising generation.” 
He clearly states that in the years 1712 to 1730 a knowledge of grammar, 
and of the Latin and Greek languages, could be obtained in the colony. 
Education in South Carolina has always been largely provided for 
in private schools, instead of in the public schools as in many North- 
ern States. There is ample evidence of the existence of many private 
schools alongside the five free ones noticed by Dr. Ramsay. This au- 
thority also says that “the number of individuals who could afford 
to maintain private tutors increased in like manner.”! Many schools 
were established by societies formed for charitable and other purposes, 
and located in different parts of the State, in the districts of Ninety- 
Six, York, and Lancaster, and other places. Besides, a large number 
were educated at an academy, “ Liberty Hall,” just over the North 
Carolina line. 
Nor did the activity in founding new schools cease with the opening 
of hostilities. The religious societies went on establishing new insti- 
tutions, and the Legislature continued to incorporate them. Of course, 
after the fall of Charleston in 1780, when the State was overrun by the 
enemy, but little attention could be paid to the cause of education. 
But at the “ close of the Revolution there were eleven public and three 
charitable grammar schools, and eight private schools, of which we 
know; that is, twenty-two schools in the twenty-four parishes and dis- 
tricts into which the State was then divided.”? It was in these schools 
that Charles Pinckney, Edward Rutledge, and Dr. Wells were trained. 
YOUTH SENT TO ENGLAND. 
Although there were good facilities in the colony for a grammar- 
school education, all parents were not satisfied with them, and many 
sent their sons to England for more advanced training. This was espe- 
cially true of the low country around Charleston, where the intercourse 
with the mother country had always been close. This desire for Eng- 
lish manners and culture survived even the War of Independence, 
and an Englishman maintained a large training school in Charleston 
by modelling his course and management after those of English schools. 
Owing to the ready sale of their rice and indigo, the planters of this 
colony were probably better able to ae such eee than the inhab- 
1 Ramsay, Vol. I, Guan 9. "2 MeCrady, P 34,

itants of any of the other colonies. They had amassed enough wealth 
to travel through Europe as gentlemen of leisure, and to lend large 
sums to the colonial government at the declaration of independence. 
Some even owned their town dwellings abroad. Ralph Izard main- 
tained an establishment in London, and travelled through France, 
Italy, and a part of Germany. Gabriel Manigault lent the Government 
two hundred and twenty thousand dollars on the outbreak of hostilities. 
There is not only strong corroborative proof of the ability to send 
sons to Europe, but ample testimony that it was really done. Among 
other Carolina youth who were sent to England for this purpose, there 
were Arthur Middleton, Thomas Heyward, Thomas Lynch, Jr. (three 
of the signers of the Declaration of Independence), John and Hugh 
Rutledge, C. C. Pinckney, Thomas Pinckney, W. H. Drayton, Christo- 
pher Gadsden, Henry Laurens, John Laurens, Gabriel Manigault, Will- 
iam Wragg, and John Forcheraud Grimké. 
Dr. Gabriel Manigault, of the College of Charleston, kindly furnished 
the following list of names of Americans who were admitted to the 
London bar in the last century, and a slight glance at it will show how 
South Carolina led the other colonies, having forty-four out of a total 
of one hundred and fourteen; the next State, Virginia, having only 
seventeen.

  Hugh S. Legaré, one of the most finished scholars of the State, said in 
his essay on classical learning: “ Before, and just after the Revolution, 
many, perhaps it would be more accurate to say, most, of our youth of 
opulent families were educated at English schools and universities. 
There can be no doubt their attainments in polite literature were very 
far superior to those of their contemporaries at the North, and the 
standard of scholarship in Charleston was consequently much meres 
than in aay. other city on the continent.”!

EARLY EDUCATION IN THE COLONY. 27 
Dr. Samuel Miller, of Princeton, in 1808, expressed his belief that 
% the learned languages, especially the Greek, were less studied in the 
Hastern than in the Southern and Middle States, and that while more 
individuals attended to classical learning there than here, it was at- 
tended to more superticially. The reason is, that owing to the superior 
wealth of the individuals in the latter States, more of their sons were 
educated in Europe, and brought home with them a more accurate 
knowledge of the classics, and set the example of a more thorough 
study.”! 
Dr. Ramsay assumed that it was a regular thing for young men to be 
sent to Europe for training, and partly attributes to this fact the large 
share of national honors received by South Carolina for the first quarter 
of a century after the formation and adoption of the Constitution, no 
State having more except Virginia. He also says that “none of the 
British provinces in proportion to their numbers sent so many of their 
sons to Europe for education as South Carolina.” The natives of this 
colony, the historian Ramsay says, “from their superior knowledge, 
were eminently useful as civil and military officers in directing the 
etforts of their country in defence of their rights.”” 
They were not biassed in favor of England, as were some from other 
colonies, and it was this fondness for the mother country that Wash- 
ington mentioned “as a source of serious regret,” and that he assigned 
as a reason for the establishment of a central university. In this early 
period, not only was education fairly provided for in the free schools, 
charitable institutions, and by private tutors, but the income of the 
planters and merchants was sufficient for a large number of the youth 
to be trained in England.

  CHAPTER II. 
EDUCATION IN THE ACADEMIES. 
While the facilities for a fair education were provided in the young 
colony, yet there were no colleges even in name till 1785, and none in 
fact till after 1804, Those young men who desired an education higher 
than was provided in the existing institutions were forced to go North 
orto Europe. Even after the foundation of the South Carolina College 
many South Carolinians went outside their State for a more advanced 
course. But the standard in the State institution was high, and there 
was plenty of room for the academies to live as training schools for it 
and for Northern colleges. Besides, it seems to have been not unusual 
to prepare boys, not merely for the first year, or Freshman class, but 
even for the Junior class, or the third year. There was ample room for 
the secondary schools, and men of high character, peculiarly fitted by 
nature to train boys, planted schools all over the State, and kept up a 
high standard of excellence through the strength of their own personal- 
ity. In remote parts of the State, such schools were the cnly means of 
education for a large part of the surrounding country, and the results 
of the training given at some of them were shown in a remarkable way 
in the prominent men whom they educated. 
The country was newly settled, and the manners of the people were not 
polished. ‘Moral suasion,” if unsupported by stout hickory switches, 
was not a strong, controlling factor. Discipline was rigorously main- 
tained through fear of the ever-ready rod. Whipping of the severest 
kind was administered for most offences. All were whipped, both boys 
and girls. It was a favorite boast with iron-willed men that they 
whipped all, from the young man of twenty-three to the child of six or 
eight. Parents demanded strict discipline for their children, and the 
teachers gloried in administering it. The scholars did not feel at ease 
unless the new teacher followed the precepts of Solomon as to corporal 
punishment. The school-master, no matter how good his discipline, how 
thorough his teaching, was thought inefficient and cowardly if he did 
not use the rod. 
La Borde gives a faithful picture of the barbarous treatment that 
scholars received at the hands of their masters: 
“Among my early teachers was Robert L. Armstrong, who taught 
for four years in the Edgefield Village Academy. He was from York 
28 i

District, in our State, and a graduate of our college. He was remark- 
able for his industry and strict discipline. The academy prospered 
under his direction—students poured in from the contiguous districts, 
and not a few came from Georgia. Mr. Armstrong was a gentleman, 
and though I never received the lash from him, I must speak in terms 
of disapprobation of his whole system. His severity was extreme. He 
appeared to think that the lash was everything. He whipped without 
mercy. One hundred lashes with a tough hickory were often inflicted. 
T have seen the blood run down the legs of many a poor boy to the 
floor. Every day the system of flagellation was regularly going on, but 
Monday was peculiarly appropriated to this purpose. Some score of 
boys always appeared at school on this day with their legs padded and 
covered by an extra pair of pantaloons ; but our shrewd master was not 
to be taken in by such a stratagem,and going at his business with a 
renewed spirit, he never stopped until he had made his way through 
padding, breeches, and all, to the skin. I have seen him ruin many a 
pair of heavy winter pantaloons at a single whipping.”! 
ACADEMIES IN THE STATE. 
These training schools were scattered over the State. One of them, 
St. David’s Society, drew students from Cheraw to Georgetown. The 
method of discipline there is illustrative of the general system of man- 
agement in schools\of that day. An old student of the academy 
wrote: “The rod, the dungeon, and the fool’s cap reigned supreme. I 
have seen them all in full operation.” 
At Mount Zion the most distinguished principal was James W. 
Fludson, who taught there from 1834 to 1858. He drew students, 
several hundred in number, from the Southern States. Twenty mem- 
bers of his first ‘class were admitted to South Carolina College after 
his death. In the western part of the State was the famous Mount 
Bethel Academy, near Newberry Court House. Col. 4. Hammond, 
the father of Senator J. H. Hammond, was principal for a number of 
years. He was a graduate of Dartmouth College, a classmate and in- 
timate friend of Daniel Webster, and he secured for the school a high 
reputation.’ 
Farther west, in Abbeville County, was the school of James L. Les- 
ley, who taught several men afterward of State reputation: Edward 
Noble, E. W, Simkins, Whitfield Brooks, J. M. Lipscomb, and Judge 
McGowan. Not far from him was M. J. Williams, among whose students 
were Gen. M. W. Gary, and Judges Kershaw and Wallace. Farther 
north, in Anderson County, was a well-known school whose name was 
made by one man, Wesley Leverett. His most famous pupil is now 
Senator Joseph E. Brown, who received nearly all his education there. 
The wonderful progress of this eminent politician and railroad man-

ager of Georgia “ can be understood when it is known that in two years’ 
study from the groundwork, young Brown fitted himself to enter an 
advanced class in college”! In Charleston, also, there was a flour- 
ishing school, kept by an Englishman, the following sketch of which 
has been prepared by Dr. Manigault: 
THE CLASSICAL SCHOOL OF MR. CHRISTOPHER COTES. 
«The history of education in South Carolina, especially along the sea- 
board, would not be complete without a notice of a celebrated private 
school which flourished in Charleston between the years 1820 and 1850. 
“The principal of the school was Mr. Christopher Cotes, an English- 
man, who had received a thorough school education in his own coun- 
try, and, without going to one of the Universities, had commenced life 
as an employé in the commissary department of the British army in 
Spain. ‘ 
“At the reduction of the army which followed the events of 1815, he 
emigrated to America, and soon became established in Charleston as a 
successful schoolmaster. He seems at an early day to have gained the 
confidence of the community, and the boys who were placed under his 
charge were principally the sons of well-to-do parents ; so that it was 
generally considered that Mr. Cotes only received as scholars those 
whose families were socially and financially prominent. 
“This was true to a certain extent; for it never was whispered among 
the boys that there was a beneficiary among them, and it may well be 
doubted whether any such was ever included among Mr. Cotes’s schol- 
ars. But there was another reason for his success, which was as fol- 
lows: 
“Mr. Cotes represented the English idea in his conception of educa- 
tion, although he was gradually obliged to introduce innovations which 
were demanded by the parents as well as by the teachers. If left to 
himself the curriculum of his school would probably have been identical 
with that of the typical English ones, with the classics, mathematics, 
and history constituting the essential features. As the writer knew 
the school, there seemed to be the same variety of subjects taught as 
in the other less important schools of the same city, the classics and 
mathematics, however, being the most important branches. 
“ But the feature in American school education to which he was 
entirely indifferent, and which was actually forced upon him by the 
nature of his surroundings, was oratory. Mr. Cotes was thoroughly 
English in his patriotism as well as in his education, and he had 
supreme contempt for the utterances contained in the extracts from 
American speeches of the Revolutionary period, which formed a large 
part of a text-book for boys known as the United States Speaker. 
“Tt seems that in Mnglish schools the boys are never made to practice

EDUCATION IN THE ACADEMIES. Bl 
public speaking, and, in addition to his annoyance at being obliged to 
listen to the speeches which were abusive of Old England, and of which 
the scholars seemed never to tire, he considered the exercise as not belong- 
ing strictly to a correct system. As a compromise, therefore, between 
the two extremes of being obliged to have the exercises, and of being 
forced to listen to assertions which were wounding to his feelings, he 
expressed great satisfaction on a certain occasion, when one of the clever 
boys of the school ascended the little platform and delivered in Latin 
a passage from one of Cicero’s orations. There was no oratory dis- 
played in the effort; it was simply the repeating from memory of a cer- 
tain amount of Latin. Mr. Cotes was gratified at the weleome change, 
and the innovation was repeated by many of the other boys in order to 
please him. 
“The other cause, therefore, of the success of the school was that it 
was modelled after those of England as far as it lay in his power, and 
as far as the requirements of a different country could permit. This 
suited precisely the wishes of those Charleston parents whose fathers 
had been educated in England, and who were of the opinion that the 
school system in that country was in every respect the best. As soonas 
liis ability was recognized, Mr. Cotes received the patronage of a large 
number of families, and, with his school averaging for many years over 
one hundred boys, each one paying $100 for the year, he was able to 
employ the best of assistants, to contribute from his annual savings 
towards the support of his aged father and mother at home, and to lay 
up a certain sum for his own maintenance in old age. ‘The two assist- 
ants who remained with him the longest were the two brothers Messrs. 
William J. Lesesne and Isaac Lesesne, both of whom had been his schol- 
ars. 
“ Mr. Cotes, although he had not received a university education, was 
perfectly competent as a teacher of the classics and mathematics, in 
consequence of his thorough training in an English school. He pre- 
pared many youths for the South Carolina and Charleston Colleges, and 
a few for Harvard, Yale, and Princeton. They were usually well pre- 
pared, and the professors of the two first-named institutions had fre- 
quently occasion to bear testimony to the thorough grounding of those 
who had been his scholars, in both the classics and mathematics. Several 
boys from his school went afterwards to the school of the Rev. Dr, 
Muhlenberg, at College Point, near Flushing, Long Island, to prepare 
for Yale and other colleges, and the teachers soon observed how well 
they were grounded in the classics. 
“Tn regard to mathematics, the writer, at an early age, had the op- 
portunity of observing for himself Mr. Cotes’s ability to make the sub- 
ject of algebra clear to a class of boys. A year before the class came 
under his supervision, while it was still taught by one of the assistants, 
Mr. Cotes called the class to his room for an hour, three days in the 
week, and, with much patience. instructed them in the elements of

| 
algebra from a little text-book which, by its simplicity, was well suited. 
to the purpose. The solution of the questions in the book was made by 
algebraic formule. The interest which he took in making each boy, 
one after the other, go through the reasoning which was necessary in 
order to reach a solution of each problem, showed that he did not per. 
form his duties in a perfunctory way, but that he had the real inter- 
ests of his pupils at heart. 
“The younger classes were practiced daily in spelling, arithmetic 
was carefully taught, geography was made more simple by the boys 
being obliged to prepare drawings of maps, and a good handwriting 
was encouraged by the regular employment of a competent instructor; 
French was the only modern language for which there was a teacher, 
but he was always a native Frenchman; rhetoric, composition on some 
subject suitable to the capacity of each class, also occasionally a text- 
book for the younger classes which gave them an insight into common 
every-day matters. All these combined made the school so completely 
equipped, that he who was not able to profit by the opportunities 
offered was indeed a dunce, and one of the peculiarities of Mr. Cotes 
was the little sympathy he displayed for that variety of school-boys. 
As soon as one such became unmistakably apparent his departure from 
the school was encouraged. 
“Tn addition to the opportunities for instruction which have been 
enumerated, he procured in England a large telescope which cost sev- 
eral hundred dollars, and a philosophical apparatus for the advanced 
classes. It is the writer’s belief, however, that he found that astron- 
omy and natural philosophy were more suited to college students, and 
he consequently abandoned the effort to teach them in his school. 
“There still remains to explain the mode of punishment which was 
practiced in the school, and the way in which its discipline was main- 
tained. As an Englishman Mr. Cotes never gave a thought to any 
other system but the birch, but, on account of its scarcity in America, 
he substituted the rattan, as being an implement more lasting and con- 
venient to handle. He reserved the chastising of the boys exclusively 
for himself, as he had observed that the assistant teachers sometimes 
lost their tempers when punishing a boy in the classes, and he not un- 
frequently lost his temper himself with those classes which recited to 
him, and became unnecessarily severe. During school hours any boy 
requiring correction for misbehavior was sent to the principal for pun- 
ishment and when the hour for the dismissal of the school had arrived, 
those boys who had received bad marks from the assistant teachers for 
their lessons remained, and Mr. Cotes visited the various rooms and 
dealt out the rattan in such amount as he considered the various marks 
called for. 
“ Forty and fifty years ago corporal punishment was practiced in all 
the Charleston schools without any doubt as to its propriety. There 
was probably not one boy, of the many hundreds who attended Mr,
-P-A-G-E-33
  EDUCATION IN THE ACADEMIES, 33 
Cotes’s school, who could boast of never having been touched by his 
rattan, and the writer has yet to hear of any one of them who is not 
convinced that the experience was a wholesome one. 
“Mr. Cotes visited Paris in the summer of 1847, during one of his oc- 
casional trips to England. At that time the writer of this paper was at 
school in that city, and Mr. Cotes took the opportunity of inspecting 
the school in company with the writer’s father. He had a fair knowl- 
edge of French, which, however, he had not learned at school, for no 
modern language was taught at the English schools during his boy- 
hood; but he was not able to converse in the language at any length, 
and it was necessary to interpret for him. He paid a long visit and 
exchanged views on various educational’ topics with the French 
schoolmasters. When the subject of punishments which prevailed in 
France and in England was discussed, the Frenchman gave it as his 
opinion that corporal punishment was unseemly and brutal, and stated 
it was altogether a thing of the past in France.. He explained that the 
French way of correcting school-boys was to keep them in during rec- 
reation hours, and make them employ their time in writing a certain 
number of lines of poetry—the system applicable only to boarding- 
schools. For good recitations and good behavior they were entitled to 
certificates which were worth a certain number of lines of poetry, and 
when one had misbehaved or missed a lesson, and the punishment of a 
nuinber of lines was inflicted, he could pay the debt with one or more 
of his certificates. In this way many a boy passed through his school 
days in France without losing a single recreation hour; but there were 
also a number of incorrigible ones in every school who were, by nature, 
fond of writing poetry and who, during the scholastic year, had very 
few hours of boyish enjoyment and fun. It is understood, of course, 
that the poetry alluded to was copied, and not composed. The French. 
man, Monsieur Penant, spoke with emphasis in his denunciation of cor- 
poral punishment, which he seemed to know was practiced on the other 
side of the Atlantic, and Mr. Cotes winced slightly at hearing what he 
said. He did not reply directly to Monsieur Penant, but turned to the 
others and said in English: ‘The schoolmasters of England long ago 
coneluded that, if they should abandon the rod, the time would soon 
come when the boys themselves would be masters of the schools. and 
its continuance is a matter of absolute necessity.’ 
r “Monsieur Penant, as a Frenchman, was as patriotic as Mr. Cotes 
was from his stand-point of an Englishman, and each one was perfectly 
satisfied that everything in his own country was of the best. Both were 
under the erroneous impression which had been fostered for generations 
concerning the habits and customs which were peculiar to the other’s 
country, and the crushing defeats that the French had suffered at the 
hands of the English made the former averse to anything like friendliness. 
The entente cordiale of 1854 and 1855 had not yet been reached, and 
every Englishman was still the natural enemy of every Frenchman.

-P-A-G-E-34
  34 HIGHER EDUCATION IN SOUTH CAROLINA 
“Monsieur Penant’s school, situated near the Havre railway station, 
was a large day school with only room for twenty-five boarders, most 
of whom went daily to the Collége Bourbon near by. The building was 
small and old-fashioned, but every thing was kept scrupulously clean, 
thanks to the exertions of his industrious wife, and his supervision of 
all the studies was constant and unremitting. Many American boys 
had been under his care, and he had succeeded wonderfully in teach- 
ing them the French language. But he had found them unruly and 
difficult to control, and he announced. definitely that he preferred not to 
lave any more, 
“With regard to the two systems of punishment, the writer, having 
had the opportunity of experiencing both, may be pardoned in making 
a passing remark upon them. In the English schools, or in those 
modelled after them, like Mr. Cotes’s school, a spirit of truthfulness is 
encouraged and developed by the modes of management. A boy who 
stands up manfully for his punishment, and, after school hours, isallowed 
some liberty and not confined to the four walls of either the school 
building or recreation grounds, as is the case in the Paris schools, where 
he is eternally watched by one of the assistant teachers, becomes, as a 
man an altogether different being from one who has been under the 
French system. Prevarication, on the other hand, is a common vice in 
French schools, and it seems to be favored by the system. The com- 
plicated arrangement by which a college like the College Bourbon, 
known as a college externe, from its not having accommodations for 
boarders, but receiving its pupils twice a day from neighboring schools 
and private dwellin gs, adds also to the opportunities for deception and 
falsehood on the part of the boys, is too long to explain in detail. The 
lessons for the morrow are indicated by the professor at the college, 
but are studied and recited at the schools, and the record books by 
which the recitation marks are conveyed to the professor, who examines 
each one carefully, are an endless subject of trickery. English and 
American parents have often been warned against this prevaricating 
feature in Parisian boarding-schools. If a boy has not already had cor- 
rect principles instilled into him, he runs the risk of not holding the 
virtue of truthfulness in proper respect in after life in consequence of 
the association. 
“Js it not probable that the independent manliness of the English- 
man, who is found in almost every quarter of the globe, thus securing 
to his race so much valuable new territories, is partly the consequence 
of the liberty which is allowed him as a boy? While the Frenchman, 
who is kept in leading-strings until manhood, is characterized by an 
unwillingness to leave his own country, and an almost total absence of 
success out of France in the higher branches of commercial and finan- 
cial venture. e 
“While on the subject of French schools, with a pamphlet before the 
writer to refresh his memory, which contains the addresses at the dis-
-P-A-G-E-35
  EDUCATION IN THE ACADEMIES. 35 
tribution of prizes at the Collége Bourbon in August, 1847, and the 
names of the successful competitors, it can be observed in it that, lim- 
ited as the curriculum of English schools then was, the scope of the 
studies in French colleges was smaller still. Boys go to these colleges 
from eight and nine to nineteen and twenty, and, with the exception of 
arithmetic and geography in the two youngest classes, until the seven- 
teenth year, there is nothing taught beyond the classics and history. 
Mathematics is introduced only during the seventeenth year. This is 
a striking fact, the evidence in favor of which is undoubted, and, after 
all that has been said about education, it seems to prove what has been 
often asserted—that it is much more a training of the mind than a 
storing of knowledge. It would seem then that Mr. Cotes was work- 
ing in the right direction when he took so much pains with that class 
of small boys in algebra. It was not so much the rudiments of the 
science he was teaching them, as that he was exercising their minds to 
reason out the solutions of the problems. 
“After his scholars had reached their thirteenth and fourteenth years 
he generally ceased to punish them. He was not a muscular man, and 
would probably have had the worst of an attempt to correct a boy of 
fifteen or sixteen if there was resistance, and it was well understood 
throughout~the school that if a larger boy who absolutely required 
punishment should try to prevent its being administered he would be 
immediately expelled. Such a case occurred under the writer’s ob- 
servation, and there was no hesitation in enforcing the determination. 
“Mr. Cotes injured himself and his school by his indifference to 
elocution. There were other schools in Charleston, not having the 
same prestige and reputation, where great attention was paid to it. 
Their public exhibitions would be visited by his pupils, and the excellent 
oratorical displays of school-boys were listened to attentively, with a 
feeling of wonder that no efforts were made by Mr. Cotes to develop 
the talent in his school. Paul H. Hayne, the poet, became one of his. 
scholars after having been for some years at another school, where great 
pains had been taken to make him a public speaker. For a youth at 
school his declamation was very creditable, and so great was the interest 
felt by the other boys in his appearance onthe speaker’s platform, that it 
was always known the day before that his time had come, and the school- 
room the next morning was crowded with eager listeners. The speech 
was usually well memorized, and the audience invariably interested 
and attentive—the principal alone being indifferent and unmoved. . 
“When Mr. Cotes first arrived in Charleston he came as an entire 
stranger, not having had with him any letters of introduction. He be- 
came known, therefore, by the sheer force of his ability as a teacher, 
and, when his reputation had become established, and he had become a . 
_ person of some importance, he enjoyed frequently the hospitalities of 
those families who were his patrons. It was grateful to him to be thus 
recognized, although he was naturally of a retiring disposition, but it
-P-A-G-E-36
  36 HIGHER EDUCATION IN SOUTH CAROLINA, 
became the occasion of his exhibiting the only weakness that could be 
charged against him. His partiality for those boys who were the sons 
of his hosts was marked, and apparent to the rest of the school. There 
was one redeeming feature in it, however, that should be mentioned. 
It was, that his natural antipathy to all dunces was so inveterate that 
it would have been impossible for him to show any partiality for one, 
however great the social eminence of the father might be. He gave the 
name of ‘two-penny’ to one of this genus on a certain occasion, and 
he was known forever afterward by that sobriquet. 
«He was spare of person, of medium height, and had lost an eye— 
the cause of this misfortune having never been explained by him. He 
was a faithful adherent of the Church of England, and attended regu- 
larly the services of St. Philip’s Church in Charleston, accompanied by 
as many of the boys who boarded with him as his pew could contain. 
During a part of his sojourn in Charleston he kept a pair of horses, and 
drove them constantly himself in the afternoons. Sometimes he would 
take one of his pupils with him, and, more than once, when alone, upon 
meeting one away from his home, he would invite him to take a seat 
with him. He also occasionally allowed one or more of his favorite boys 
to ride the horses. ‘Chis pair seemed to be the only luxury he allowed 
himself, as his tastes were simple, and he thus was able to provide fully 
for old age, Reading and study were the principal occupations of his 
spare time. 
“At length the constant strain of an occupation which, of all others» 
is the most trying to the temper, began to tell, and signs of failing com- 
menced toappear. During the winter of 1848-49 he had a slight stroke 
of paralysis, and when he returned again to the school-room, after a ten 
days’ confinement to his bed-room, his appearance was much changed for 
the worse. Inthe spring he made another trip to England, where he 
spent the summer, and returned in the fall somewhat improved in health. 
But he found that permanent recovery was impossible, and, after an- 
other year, he gave up the work altogether, and resigned his school to 
his successors. Upon returning to England to end his days, he resided 
at Newington Rectory with a brother, the Reverend Septimus Cotes, a 
clergyman of the Church of England and rector of Newington, near 
Wallingford, nine miles from Oxford. He here lingered in feeble health 
until his death in 1856. 
“ After his permanent return he was visited by several of his American 
friends and former pupils who happened to be in England, and, although 
wasted by disease, he exhibited an interest in many, after whom he 
especially inquired. 
“Mr. Cotes invested in the United States a considerable sum from 
his earnings, and in his will he left as his executor a prominent citi- 
zen of Charleston who had been his life-long friend. The property 
yielded a good return, and, when the late war was over, there was a 
considerable. sum accumulated from the interest due. When this was

in hand, the Reverend Mr. Cotes, who still lives at an advanced age, 
having been informed of the pecuniary distress then prevailing at the 
South, especially among those who had been wealthy, instructed the 
executor to distribute among the most needy of his brother’s former 
scholars or their families the entire sum that had been received. This 
was accordingly done, and many cases of actual want were relieved by 
this act of generosity. 
“Mr. Cotes was liberal in all of his expenditures for his school, and 
his table for all those who boarded with him was abundantly supplied. 
In all of his dealings he was honest and upright, and he invariably ex- 
erted his influence with those under his charge to induce them to avoid 
all mean acts. His presence in Charleston for so many years, having 
in his care a large proportion of the youth of the city, has marked an 
epoch in its educational history. 
“@, E. Manieauur, M. D. 
“ Charleston, S. C., September, 1887.” 
But the greatest and most famous of all the academies in South 
Carolina was that of 
MOSES WADDEL. 
Although there were no colleges in South Carolina except in name, 
the best substitute was provided by first-class work in the academies, 
of which the most famous was at Willington, in Abbeville County. It 
owed its fame to the efforts of one man, Moses Waddel. If any teacher 
deserves to be remembered by reason of the prominent men whom he 
taught in their boyhood, the subject of this sketch can claim as strong 
a title to such a remembrance as any. His school held for years the 
highest rank among the schools of the State, and attracted students 
from all parts of the State and from other States, while his influence 
was felt even in distant States. The importance of his work demands 
a short sketch of his life. 
His family were Presbyterians an@ lived in North Carolina. <A rela- 
tive of his, James Waddel, was the author of the famous sermon so 
graphically described by the celebrated William Wirt, on the agony 
and death of Christ, in which he reached, according to Wirt, the sub- 
limity and grandeur of Massillon or Bourdaloue. Moses Waddel was 
born in Rowan County, July 27,1770. In that newly-settled country 
educational advantages were very meagre, and schools were maintained 
only at longintervals. But, in spite of these disadvantages, such were 
his capacity and application, that at the age of fourteen he was recom- 
mended by his teacher for a tutorship in Camden Academy, as the best 
linguist in his school. Owing to his tender age and the dissipations of 
city life, his father refused the offer. His academic career immedi- 
ately ceased; up to this time, though, he had spent in all only five 
years at school. The following year he took charge of a school of twenty 
pupils, teaching the ordinary English branches and Latin for seventy 
dollars yearly. In 1786 he went to Greene County, Ga., but was soon

driven off by a threatened invasion of the Indians, and then applied for 
a position in the Richmond Academy, at Augusta, Ga., but failed to 
get it. 
Being impressed by the demoralized condition of the country, result- 
ing from the war and by the spread of infidelity, he felt it his duty to 
enter the ministry. In order to prepare himself for the work he went 
to Hampden-Sidney College, and graduated in eight months and twenty- 
six days, in September, 1791. Shortly after this he was licensed to preach, 
and he began his life-work as preacher and teacher. He first set- 
tled in Georgia and opened a school near the little town of Appling, 
in 1723 or 1794, but a few years after he removed to Vienna; then 
finally established his famous institution at Willington, his country seat, 
in 1804. It was located on the high ridge between the Savannah and 
Little Rivers, free from malaria; and the Huguenot settlers for several 
miles along Little River, and the Scotch-Izish settlers on the Savannah, 
furnished a number of patrons for the young teacher. It was chiefly 
through the influence of one of the Huguenot descendants, Pierre 
Gibert, that the school had been moved from Vienna. The locality 
has*been the home and birth-place of many prominent persons. A 
widow from Charlestown, a relative of Governor Bull, had settled here 
for the education of her twosons. Here that strong Unionist of Charles- 
ton, James L, Petigru, was born. “On one of the most charming of 
these delightful river-hills” George McDuffie spent the most of his life. 
John ©. Calhoun lived here until he entered Congress. 
With such favorable surroundings, the school-house was built on a 
pleasant ridge covered with the chinquapin, with the noble oak and 
hickory interspersed, and lower down nearer the little stream were 
some beech trees, on which ambitious students were accustomed to carve 
their names. Instead of large, luxurious dormitories for the students, 
were built little log huts, with chimneys of wood usually, but sometimes 
of brick. The students were encouraged to build these themselves. 
The whole formed ‘a street shaded by majestic oaks, and composed 
entirely of log huts, varying in size from six to sixteen feet square. 
* * * The street was about forty yards wide and the houses ten or 
twelve ranged on the sides, either built by the students themselves or 
by architects hired by them.” The common price was five dollars for 
a house, ‘on front row, water-proof, and easily chinked. *.* * In 
the suburbs were several other buildings of the same kind erected by 
literary recluses * * * who could not endure the din of the city 
at play-time—at play-time, we say, for there was no din in it in study 
hours. At the head of the street stood the academy, differing in noth- 
ing from the other buildings but in size, and the number of its rooms.” 
There were two rooms in this, one for the primary pupils, while “ the 
larger was the recitation room of Dr. Waddel himself, the prayer-room, 
  
1 From a private letter by Mrs. M. E. Davis, of Alabama,
-P-A-G-E-39
  
EDUCATION IN THE ACADEMIES. 39 
court-room, and general-convocation room for all matters concerning 
the school. It was without seats and just large enough to contain one 
hundred and fifty boys standing erect, close pressed, and leave a circle 
of six feet diameter at the door for jigs and cotillons at the teacher's 
regular soirées every Monday morning.” ! 
In this sylvan retreat “gathered students from all parts of this and 
the adjoining States, and the wild woods of the Savannah resounded 
with the echoes of Homer and Virgil, Cicero and Horace.” Under the 
wide-spreading branches in summer, and in their huts in winter, the 
students diligently studied, changing their occupations at the sound of 
the ‘horn, and repairing to the house for recitation when called for by 
the name of “ the Virgil class, the Homer class,” or by the name of the 
author they were studying. “In a moment they appear before their 
preceptor, and with order and decorum recite their lessons—are criti- 
cally examined in grammar and syntax—the construction of sentences— 
the formation of verbs—the antiquities of Greece and Rome—the history 
and geography of the ancients, illustrative of the author whose works 
they recite; and are taught to relish his beauties and enter into his 
spirit. Thus class succeeds to class without the formality of definite 
hours for study or recitation till all have recited. In the presence of 
the students assembled a solemn and appropriate prayer, imploring the 
Eternal in their behalf, begins and ends the exercises of each day.”? 
Far removed from the noise and dissipations of the city, the students 
applied themselves closely to their work. Among sober, industrious 
people, and anxious to merit the praise of their great preceptor, they 
had to study or be pointed at by the finger of scorn. Such was the 
spirit among them that drones were hardly tolerated at all, and nine 
in ten studied as hard as their health would permit. Their life was 
simple and industrious, and their food was Spartan in its plainness,— 
corn-bread and bacon. Instead of gas and students’ lamps, they 
pored over the lessons by the aid of pine torches. At the sound of the 
horn they retired to bed, except a few adventurous spirits that set out 
in quest of hen-roosts or to unhinge gates. They rose at dawn and 
resumed their studies. Instead of: playing base-ball or foot-ball, boys 
took their recreation in “running, jumping, wrestling, playing town- 
' ball, and bull-pen. The big boys hunted squirrels, turkeys, ete., on 
Saturdays, and ’possums and coons at night.” 
At first the school was composed chiefly of country boys, but about 
1810 a large number of youth from the towns came in and abused their 
liberty so that their privileges were greatly curtailed. The students were 
then forbidden the use of fire-arms, required to retire at nine o’clock, 
rise with the sun, and take only fifteen minutes at each meal. Although 
the school turned out so many prominent men, it is quite remarkable 
that “‘ with two or three exceptions no student who entered this school

between the years 1806 and 1810 from the largest cities of Georgia and 
South Carolina, ever became greatly distinguished ; while the period in- 
cluding those dates was the most fruitful of great men of any of the 
same length during the whole time of Dr. Waddel’s instructorship.” ! 
Although devoted to the classics, Dr. Moses Waddel preferred to 
follow the advice of Solomon rather than the precept of Plato with re- 
gard to the use of the rod. He managed his school through the aid of 
monitors, whom he appointed from among the best students, and he 
never whipped except on their report, and afterwards on the decision 
of a jury of the boys. He flogged only for misbehavior, but he “rarely, 
if ever, corrected a student for deficiency in recitation,” knowing that if 
“turning off” did not cure him, flogging would do no good. “To be 
required to recommit a lesson was considered such a disgrace by all 
the students that he never found it necessary to apply any other cor- 
rective to this delinquency.” He believed in the efficacy of the rod as 
a moral reformer, and he managed his school very largely on this idea. 
“His government was one of touching moral suasion, but he adminis- 
tered it in a new way.” 
All of Dr. Waddel’s pupils loved and venerated him. He wasa worker 
himself, and he required work of others. He was indefatigable in 
watching over his pupils, in studying their natures, and directing and 
encouraging each one according to his disposition. In spite of his ap- 
parent unkindness, he was affectionately devoted to their interests, 
and often advised them in private of their conduct, and warned them 
against bad associates. He often rode at nights to the different board- 
ing-houses to see if his pupils were studying. If he found them idle, 
he told them of it the next day. Thoroughness in their work he in- 
sisted on, and the results of it are seen in the great number of his 
students that entered the Junior class in the different colleges. One 
of the early Governors of South Carolina, Patrick Noble, wrote: “I was 
examined by the faculty of Princeton College to-day and was admitted 
into the Junior class.” John ©. Calhoun within two years was pre- 
pared to enter the Junior class at Yale. The great orator McDuffie 
and the two Wardlaws entered the Junior class in South Carolina Col- 
lege. Judge A. B. Longstreet also entered the Junior at Yale. In fact 
nearly all who were fitted at this school entered the Junior class. Indeed 
the president of Nassau Hall (Princeton) said that the students from 
this school were as well prepared as those from any other part of the 
Union. 
He himself, it is said, knew some of the Latin authors by heart, and 
it is related that he would hear the class recite in Virgil with his eyes 
closed. If a slight mistake was made he would instantly speak out, 
“That’s wrong, sir!” and correct it without looking at the book. The 
drones of the class would prepare one hundred to one hundred and fifty 
lines of Virgil for a single recitation, while the bright leaders would

EDUCATION IN THE ACADEMIES. 41 
master one thousand. The brilliant, ambitious boys would not be held 
back by the drudges; he would form new classes and push the best 
students on. The school was large, probably too large, in later years 
for the force employed, as it numbered upwards of one hundred and 
fifty, and one authority puts it at two hundred and fifty.’ 
His charaeter and individuality were impressed on his students so 
that the impressions were lasting even among their descendants. Men 
are still living who speak with pride of their attendance at Willington, 
and their children cherish it as an honor to the family. George Me- 
Duffie, when a Senator, and Thomas Farr Capers in after life revisited 
the place, and as they walked among the dilapidated houses, and re- 
called their old teacher and his school, they were moved to tears. No 
other man in the South, has so powerfully impressed himself on men 
who influenced the destiny of the country as this Willington master. 
He needs no monument, but lives in the great men whom he bastrained. 
There went forth from this school “one Vice-President, and many 
foreign and Cabinet ministers ; and Senators, Congressmen, Governors, 
judges, presidents and professors of colleges, eminent divines, barris- 
ters, jurists, legislators, physicians, scholars, military and naval officers 
innumerable.” 
It would be impossible to get a complete list of the great men edu- 
cated there, but a partial list will give an idea of the influence exerted. 
In the early years of the school came W. H. Crawford, at the age of 
twenty-two, and remained two years. He was probably defeated for 
the Presidency in 1824 by an unfortunate stroke of paralysis, and is 
regarded as ‘‘the greatest of the citizens of Georgia ;” Eldred Simkins, 
M. C., South Carolina, was a contemporary; and then came John C. 
Calhoun, who lived a life “more tragical than any tragedy,” and stands 
forth the clearest of the great trio;? W. D. Martin, judge and M. C.; 
James L. Petigru, eminent lawyer, who was a strong Unionist, and ex- 
pressed his disapproval of secession by deliberately walking out of 
church, when the minister prayed for the dissolution of the Union in 
1860; Andrew Govan, M. C.; Hugh S. Legaré, Attorney-General, for- 
eign and Cabinet minister; George McDuffie, M. C., Governor, and U. 
S. Senator; George R. Gilmer, M. C., and Governor of Georgia; George 
Carey, M. C., Georgia; John Walker, M. C., Alabama; Henry W. Col- . 
jier, Chief-Justice of Supreme Court of Alabama, and Governor in 1846 
or 1848; Lawrence E. Dawson, a distinguished lawyer in South Caro- 
lina and afterwards in Alabama, died in 1848; John S. Hunter, of Dal- 
las County, Alabama, judge of cireuit court and a distinguished lawyer; 
George W. Crawford, M. C., and Governor of Georgia; Patrick Noble, 
Governor; D. L. Wardlaw, judge; F. H. Wardlaw, chancellor; A. B.

U.S. Senator; and P. M. Butler, Governor, and colonel of the Palmetto 
Regiment in the Mexican War.! 
George Carey prepared a thousand lines of Virgil for a Monday’s 
recitation when at Willington. The Virgil class was too large, and 
, its members were of such unequal grade, that the teacher announced 
that it would be divided on the basis of the work done by each one by 
the following Monday, and it was under this stimulus that Carey did 
his work. George McDuffie excelled this intellectual feat a year or so _ 
later with one thousand two hundred and twelve lines of Horace. He 
was poor, and was boarded gratuitously in the family of Mr. William 
Calhoun. His ability was first recognized by James Calhoun, who aided 
him in his attendance at the South Carolina College. He was a very 
hard student and is said “to have devoured his Latin grammar in three 
weeks.” The Hon. Lawrence E. Dawson, father of the present United 
States Commissioner of Education, Col. N. H. R. Dawson, was a stu- 
dent in the school with McDuffie. His son relates his father’s account 
of how closely McDuffie applied himself; that he would walk from his 
boarding-house to the school, a mile distant, with his open book before 
him, studying all the time. 
The school was continued until 1819, when Dr. Waddel was 
elected president of the Georgia University (Franklin College). His 
success here was as marked as at Willington. He carried with him 
the same powers of organization, the same intense earnestness and 
prayerfulness, the same tender regard for the students, and the same 
zeal in religious matters that had marked his career at Willington. 
The college needed his vigor and prudence to raise it to literary emi- 
nence, “and to the wisdom and prudence and reputation of that good 
man is Georgia very largely indebted for the respectability and useful- 
ness of her State College. The success which attended his efforts in 
raising the institution so rapidly as he did to respectability, has been 
to many inexplicable. But to those who well understood his character 
that success is by no means surprising.”? When he took charge of the 
college the circumstances were such “as few men would have been able 
to meet without abandoning the object in despair.” But at the end 
of ten years he was permitted to see a vast change for the better. 
Judge Longstreet says “the effect of his coming to this institution was 
almost magical; it very soon obtained a measure of prosperity alto- 
gether unequalled in its previous history.” He took it only after the 
urgent solicitation of the trustees, and after earnest prayer on his part. 
But he deliberately concluded that a greater field of usefulness was 
open to him for advancing the cause of education, of religion, and of 
morality, and he considered it his duty to accept the place. But “in 
1Most of the above are found in William Mitten, p. 99; for the remainder the 
author is indebted to the kindness of J. F. Calhoun, Esq., Due West, 8. C., and 
others.

consequence of advancing age and declining health,” he retired from 
the office in 1829, and returned to Willington. He supervised the school, 
opened there by his sons, who made it as large as it was under him, 
In 1836 he suffered a stroke of palsy, by which his mind was affected. 
On the election of his son to a professorship at Athens, Ga., in 1836, he 
was removed to that place, where he died July 21, 1840. Judge Long- 
street delivered a eulogy on him a short time afterwards. 
He was a man of the most unwearied activity and the broadest sym- 
pathies. The amount of his charities will never be known, since he 
never gave ostentatiously. He was prominent not as an educator only, 
but as a minister, and it is said that the renewal of the Presbyterian 
Shurch in Abbeville County was due to his efforts. He preached reg- 
alarly there during bis whole stay, and also at Athens he was very 
active in religious work. He was especially anxious to educate the 
young men preparing for the ministry. He assisted them with his 
counsel and with his purse. He interested himself at Athens to in- 
duce families to board such young men freely. ‘‘ His discourses were 
always grave, solemn, and practical, possessing few of the ornaments 
of style, but occasionally enlivened with flashes of true eloquence.” 
He never read his sermons, holding that the subject was so solemn 
and grand in its importance that a man could preach with freedom 
,and power extempore. On one occasion a distinguished minister was 
reading his sermon, and the house became so dark that he was forced 
to close abruptly. Dr. Waddel whispered loud enough to be heard 
by all in the pews, ‘‘ He is served right!”! His greatest pupil, John 
C. Calhoun, testified of him: “It was as a teacher that he was most 
distinguished. In that character he stands almost unrivalled. Indeed, 
he may be justly considered as the father of classical education in the 
upper-country of South Carolina and Georgia. His excellence in that 
character depended not so much on extensive or profound learning, 
as a felicitous combination of qualities for the government of boys 
and communicating to them what he knew. * * # Among his pu- 
pils are to be found a large portion of the eminent men of the State 
of Georgia.”? He truly deserved the name of the “Oarolina Dr. Ar- 
nold,” given him by W. J. Grayson, the biographer of Mr. Petigru. 
In personal appearance he was “about five feet nine inches high, of 
stout muscular frame, and a little inclined to corpulency. In limb nearly 
perfect. His head was uncommonly large, and covered with a thick 
coat of dark hair. His forehead was projecting and in nothing else 
more remarkable. His eyes were gray and overshadowed by thick, 
heavy eye-brows, always closely knit in his calmest hours, and almost 
overlapping in his angry moods. His nose was bluntly aquiline. His 
lips were rather thick, and generally closely compressed. His com- 
plexion adust. His tout ensemble was, as we have said, extremely au-

stere; but it was false to his heart, for he was benevolent, affectionate, 
charitable, hospitable, and kind. He was cheerful and even playfal in 
his disposition.” ! one 
He married Miss Catharine Calhoun, sister of John ©. Calhoun, in 
1795, but she died in 1796, leaving no children. He again married and 
became the father of several children, some of whom have been promi- 
nent as educators in the South. One of them, John N. Waddel, is now 
Chancellor of South-western University, Clarksville, Tenn. He left no 
literary work except a small volume, Memoirs of Miss Catharine Eliza- 
beth Smelt, daughter of D. Smelt, M. D., of Augusta, Ga., in 1820. His 
fame rests with the great men he trained, and the secret of his success 
lies “in his sleepless vigilance over the conduct and morals of his 
scholars.” “The fruits of his vineyard are scattered far and wide 
through most of the Southern States, and long have they been seen in 
rich luxuriance in the Capitol of the Union !”? 
By permission, the following sketch of George McDuffie while at Dr. 
. Waddel’s famous academy and the South Carolina College is taken 
from an unpublished eulogy upon Mr. McDuffie by the late Hon. Ar- 
mistead Burt, of Abbeville, 8. C.: 
GEORGE M°DUFFIE. 
John McDuffie and Jane, his wife, were natives of Scotland, and soon 
after the close of the Revolutionary War came to Columbia County, in 
the State of Georgia, and made their home in the pine lands near the 
line of Warren County, some thirty miles from the city of Augusta. He 
was better educated and more intelligent than his neighbors, and nat- 
urally exerted much influence in the community. He was well known 
for the vigor of his understanding and the energy of his will. Integ- 
rity, courage, generosity, and benevolence were his characteristic qual- 
ities, and they commanded the respect and esteem of his neighbors. 
George, the younger of the sons, was born on the 10th of August,

It is but natural to feel an interest in the subsequent history of the school, a 
sketch of which is given through the painstaking kindness of John F. Calhoun, 
Esq., of Due West, 8. C., who ably met an attack on the school in one of the county 
papers in 1886. 
The following list of the teachers can be relied on’ with due confidence: Moses 
Dobbins, 1820; Mr. and Mrs. DeWitt, 1821-22; John Hannah Gray, 1823-26; Dr. M. 
Waddel and his youngest son, John N. Waddel, 1830-33; Dr. M. Waddel and an- 
other son, James P. Waddel, 1833-36; Hugh Morrow, 1837; Mr. Boyle, 1839; Thomas 
Jenkins, 1840; Isaac Moragne, 1842; Jenkins Lee, 1843; W. A. Lee, 1844; Dr. Reese, 
1245; William C. Ware, 1847; Mr. Beloit, in the interval of 1847-50; O. T. Porcher, 
1850-53; J. F. Calhoun, 1853; after 1853, Mr. Jones, James McCutcheen, and Cal- 
houn Simonds, the last teacher at Willington in 1858 or 1859. O. T. Porcher, the 
greatest of all the successors, revived the school and removed it to his home, one mile 
from Willington, and continued it successfully to his death, about 1875.

1790, in this humble home. John MeDuffie and his neighbors appear 
to have considered the school-house more important than the meeting- 
house inthe backwoods of Georgia, and they bestowed upon it the pat- 
ronage and sustenance which their small means permitted. Teachers 
seem to have been procured without difficulty, but their attainments 
and qualifications embraced only the first and smallest rudiments of 
education. in these primitive institutions Mr, McDuffie learned before 
his twelfth year so much of reading, writing, and arithmetic as quali- 
fied him to be a merchant’s clerk in a country store, and he was em- 
ployed by Mr. Hayes, whose place of business was in the vicinity. In 
these schools Mr. McDuffie displayed the wonderful genius which in 
professional and public life so much excited the admiration and wonder 
of his countrymen. But so amiable was his temper, and so affectionate 
his disposition, and so incontestable his superiority, that he excited no 
envy and no jealousy. .His school-mates united with their teachers in 
awarding to him precedence, and friends and neighbors approved and 
applauded the distinction. 
His discretion, intelligence, and assiduity, with his exemplary deport- 
ment, soon conciliated the friendship and esteem of Mr. Hayes and his 
family. At that time Augusta was the market-town of a large country 
in Georgia and South Carolina, and attracted enterprising merchants 
from both States. James Calhoun, a brother of the great statesman, 
was the leading partner of the mercantile firm of Calhoun & Wilson, 
in Augusta, which was favorably known in the upper country on both 
sides of the Savannah River. Mr, McDuffie having developed capacity 
for a larger business than that of Mr. Hayes, and being desirous to find 
employment in Augusta, on the recommendation of his employer, 
obtained a situation as clerk in the house of Calhoun & Wilson, at the 
end of the year 1804. He was received into the family of Mr. Cal- 
houn, and soon attracted his attention and secured his confidence and 
respect. His industry and fidelity in the performance of his increased 
duties, his modest and amiable deportment, his decorous life, and his 
passion for knowledge, quite distinguished him from others of his age 
and position. His duties as a clerk were performed with prompt and 
punctilious accuracy and carefulness, but every leisure moment of the 
day and many hours of the night were devoted to books. 
Dr. Moses Waddel, who had established a reputation as the prin- 
cipal of the high school at Wrightsborough, in Georgia, and who had 
taught John C. Calhoun, William H. Crawford, and others who became 
distinguished as members of the bar and as statesmen, was conducting 
with distinguished usefulness his famous academy at Willington, in Ab- 
beville County, S.C. William Calhoun was then a planter on the Savan- 
nah River, and his residence was within a mile of the academy. Busi- 
ness frequently carried him to Augusta, where he saw Mr. McDuffie in 
the family of his brother James. Prepossessed by his appearance and 
manners, and favorably impressed by the accounts of his brother James,

William Calhoun, in 1810, took Mr. McDuffie to his home, when he en- 
tered the academy. Having prepared himself in the English branches 
and acquired a considerable knowledge of history, he commenced the 
Latin course, and made the most wonderful progress. 
The Willington Academy was so famous for the number of its pupils 
who became distinguished at the bar and in the halls of legislation, 
that this sketch would be incomplete without some notice of him who 
was its founder and principal, and who impressed upon it so much of 
his strong character. The Rev. Moses Waddel was a native of North 
Jarolina, and a minister of the Presbyterian Church.' He came from 
that section of the State from which the Calhouns, the Nobles, the Hut- 
tons, and others, the colonists of that magnificent country known as 
the “Calhoun Settlement,” had emigrated. He married a daughter of 
Patrick Calhoun, the pioneer and leader of the colony. Tradition told 
that he was a relative of Mr. Waddel, the blind preacher, whose elo- 
quence is immortalized by William Wirt in the beautiful letters of the 
British Spy. The sermons of Dr. Waddel were instructive, forcible, 
and earnest, but they were not eloquent. He held the faith and the 
dogmas of his church in their straightest and strictest forms, and he 
taught them from the pulpit, and illustrated them in his life and con- 
versation in all their purity and rigor. 
But nature had destined him for another sphere of usefulness, and 
for greater fame than he had acquired in the pulpit. He possessed in 
an especial degree the qualities—physical, mental, and moral—to be an 
instructor and governor of youth, and particularly to be the principal 
of a high school. Although of medium height, his form was burly. 
His head was large, his brow was heavy, and his eyes were grey and 
cold. His speech was deliberate and authoritative. His gesture was 
commanding; he looked as one having authority, and he spoke as one 
accustomed to obedience. The whole man’s appearance, manner, and 
mien, all were imposing, masterful. His education, his high personal 
qualities, no less than his majestic presence, eminently fitted him to be 
the principal of an academy. 
The system of instruction and the discipline of the academy partook 
of the high tone and inflexible character of the principal; the former 
was thorough, and the latter was vigorous. No violation of the laws 
was allowed with impunity; punishment, prompt and condign, was ad- 
ministered without partiality and without pity; the relentless rod was 
applied to all offenders without respect to age, advancement, or social 
position. 
He was the pioneer of education in the South, and his academy at 
Wrightsborough in Georgia was the first grammar school in the back 
‘His father, William Waddel, emigrated from the neighborhood of Belfast, Ire- 
land, in 1767; he landed at Charleston, and settled on the waters of the South Yad- 
kin, in North Carolina. His son was named Moses, after the ancient prophet, on 
account of his feeble tenure on life in infancy.—Howe’s History of the Presbyterian 
Church in South Carolina, Vol. I, pp. 65

country of that State. There was no similar seminary in the upper 
country of South Carolina, and some of the young men of this State 
were pupils at Wrightsborough. John ©. Calhoun and William H. Craw- 
ford, with others who became distinguished in after life, were prepared 
by him for college. 
Mr. McDuffie came to Willington at the time when the academy had 
attained the height of its fame and its usefulness. The reputation of 
the principal as an experienced and successful teacher and vigorous 
disciplinarian attracted young men from all parts of South Carolina, 
and many from Georgia. The sober but vigorous discipline of the 
school was not its least commendation to parents and guardians of wild 
and wayward young men, The academy received generous patronage 
from Charleston and the planters of the low country. Students were 
here prepared, and well prepared, for the Junior class in colleges, and 
for the business and duties of the learned professions. Among those 
who received their preparatory education at this school and held high 
public station in after life in this State were James L. Petigru, Hugh 
S. Legaré, Patrick Noble, David Louis Wardlaw, and his younger 
brother, Francis A. Wardlaw. The standards of education were high 
and exacting, and many of the pupils acquired reputation for talents 
and scholarship which greatly contributed to their elevation in public 
affairs. Rhetoric had the importance due to it in the course of studies, 
and several of the students became well known for their gifts of ora- 
tory, which they displayed so conspicuously at the bar, in the Legis- 
lature, and in the halls of Congress. 
For the first time Mr. McDuffie saw within his reach the opportunity 
of acquiring an education, which had been the dream of his boyhood 
and the passion of his life, and he concentrated upon his lessons the 
whole force and energy of his mighty intellect. Much of his time from 
childhood had been devoted to earning a livelihood, and now he gave it 
all, and gave it passionately to books. Here for the first time he 
opened a Latin grammar, and mastered it in ten days. Within a 
fortnight after he commenced Virgil, from Friday evening to Monday 
morning he prepared for recitation eleven hundred lines, a feat which 
absolutely astounded his teachers. In all of his lessons his progress 
was equally rapid and remarkable, and excited alike the admiration 
and wonder of teachers and scholars. He had been but a short time 
at the academy before his capacity as a student and his faculty to ac- 
quire, accompanied by such modesty and reserve, raised him above all 
competition and all criticism. 
The young are always generous, but his superiority was so universally 
. conceded and was so conspicuous as to leave him above all emulation. 
Upon no theatre in his mature years did he establish a fame more real 
and enduring than at this academy and among his fellow students. As 
a speaker in the debating society he displayed that brilliant argumenta- 
 
-P-A-G-E-48
  48 HIGHER EDUCATION IN SOUTH CAROLINA. 
tion and something of that burning eloquence which characterized his 
speeches at the bar and in the Federal House of Representatives. 
Among his fewintimates at Willington was Augustus B. Longstreet, 
of Georgia, a man of genius and promise, who afterward distinguished 
himself at the bar, in judicial office, in the pulpit, and in letters. Near 
the close of his life he was elected president of the South Carolina Col- 
lege. He was most extensively and favorably known as the author of 
those graphic and humorous delineations of character, the ‘“ Georgia 
Scenes.” He and Mr. McDuffie composed that subject of debate which 
so perplexed and puzzled the members of the debating society, and con- 
stitutes one of the most amusing of the scenes, consisting of a jargon of 
words absolutely devoid of meaning, but seeming to present a subject 
for discussion. In his familiar intercourse Mr. McDuffie exhibited a rare 
sense of the ludicrous and a talent for ridicule, which was so felicitously 
displayed in his public speeches, and which identified him as the author 
of this remarkable subject for debate. This was the subject: “ Whether 
at public elections should the votes of faction predominate by internal 
suggestions or the bias of jurisprudence.” The character of the debate 
and the inevitable confusion of the speakers are too familiar for repro- 
duction. In the sketch McDuffie is called “ Mr. McDermott,” and Judge 
Longstreet says of him: “He was a man of the highest order of intel- 
lect, who, though he has since been known throughout the Union as one 
of the ablest speakers of the country, seems to me to have added but 
little to his powers of debate since he passed his twenty-second year.” 
Extraordinary as were the argumentative powers of Mr. McDutffie at 
this period of his life, it would be quite a misconception to suppose that 
his great power in argument and his attainments as a scholar at Wil- 
lington were the primary fruits of a precocious intellect. Like the great 
orators of Greece, his style of speaking in early life was eminently argu- 
mentative, deliberate, and logical, with but little of that fervid eloquence 
which gained to him at the bar, before popular assemblies, and in Con- 
gress, such magical sway over his audiences. 
Mr. McDuffie left the academy at Willington in December, 1811, and 
in that month was admitted into the Junior class of the South Carolina 
College. The college was liberally endowed, and in seven years from 
its establishment, under the presidency of Dr. Maxcy, had become the 
pride of the State. Its first and most eminent president had acquired 
experience and reputation as head of two Northern colleges. He added 
to great learning the most amiable and attractive personal qualities. 
The standards of the college were all high, and the course of study com- 
prehensive. The instruction was full and thorough. It was no longer 
necessary to send the young men of the State to the celebrated uni- 
versities of England and of the Eastern States to be educated, as had 
been the custom of wealthy parents and guardians. The president him- 
self was an accomplished elocutionist and orator, and the art of public 
speaking received special attention and consideration. This was nat-
-P-A-G-E-49
  EDUCATION IN 'THE ACADEMIES. 49 
urally a favorite branch in an institution whose pupils were destined for 
the learned professions or aspired to political distinction. Under the 
teaching and the instruction of the eloquent Maxey some of the most 
distinguished orators of the South, or of any country, took their first 
and earliest training. South Carolina owes mucii to her college for the 
eminence of her statesmen and the refinement and culture of her citi- 
zens. That college sent out from its precincts to the pulpit, to the bar, 
to the bench, to legislative halls, by far the most of those who elevated 
their State to the eminence which she so justly and so incontestably 
holds among her sister States. To that college is due in great degree 
the excellent style of speaking at the bar of the upper country. The 
standards of oratory taught there were introduced by graduates, and 
were disseminated among what was then known as the backwoods of 
Carolina. z 
Warren R. Davis of Pendleton, Bayliss J. Karle of Greenville, John 
B. O'Neal of Newberry, and David Louis Wardlaw of Abbeville, were 
graduates, and ornaments of the bar, and would have adorned the bar in 
any country. William C. Preston was graduated from this college in 
1812, George McDuffie in 1813, and Hugh 8. Legaré in 1814. Nature is 
not used to bestow her richest gifts with a prodigal hand, and the annals 
of history, ancient or modern, have no record of three men so endowed 
with the divine gift of eloquence, in any age or country, appearing at 
the same time, and in the same lécality, on the stage of life. 
Mr. McDuftie applied himself with unremitting assiduity to his stud- 
ies, combining with them a course of miscellaneous reading which left 
neither leisure nor inclination to take part in any of those rebellions 
against the government of the college which were of frequent occur- 
rence, and some of which were serious. 
The vacations were employed by him as a tutor in the families of 
country gentlemen, thus obtaining the means to complete his college 
course. The superiority which had been conceded to him atthe academy 
was uncontested in the college. His proficiency and his exemplary con- 
duct at once drew attention to him as one destined to distinction, and 
in 1813 he was graduated, not only with the first honoys of his class, 
but with a reputation that might have satisfied the aspirations of genius 
and the hopes of toil. His graduation speech on the Permanence of the 
Union was so much admired by his fellow-students, in common with 
others who were present, that it was published at their request. That 
speech, thus appreciated, was evidenceoof uncommon merit, and like 
many other productions of his genius, has been lost in the oblivion of 
time. 
‘Able and graceful as was his written composition, faultless as was his 
elocution, majestic as was his whole intellect, it was his eloquence that 
gave him his great superiority. I have heard, and heard often, the 
orators of the greatest repute in this country during the last half cen- 
tury. Many of them were greatly and justly distinguished for the

graces and elegances of rhetoric and elocution, some of them were elo- 
quent. The speeches of Calhoun were philosophical and grand, the 
speeches of Webster were logical and massive and masterly, the speeches 
of Clay and Preston were polished and brilliant. But Greece had but 
one Demosthenes, Rome had but one Cicero, and America has had but 
one McDuffie. ; 
THORNWELL ORPHANAGE, AT CLINTON. 
The Thornwell Orphanage and the Holy Communion Church Insti- 
tute are illustrations of the spirit born since the Civil War. The for- 
mer was the result of earnest effort on the part of several benevolent 
Presbyterians, who showed their love of their denomination by nam- 
ing the new institution after their greatest man, the late Rev. J. H. 
Thornwell. The Orphanage has accumulated about $26,000 worth of 
property, a large part being donated by kind friends in the North. Of 
this, about $10,000 is intended for an endowment fund; the real estate 
of the corporation has cost more than $16,000, but is worth a much 
larger sum. In addition to this property, the Orphanage has received 
and expended for current expenses nearly $50,000 since its beginning. 
This enterprise has expanded in directions hardly foreseen by its 
founders. The increasing needs of the orphan pupils for educational 
advantages equal to those usually afforded children in respectable Pres- 
byterian families, has made it necessary to attach a young ladies’ semi- 
nary and a college for young men to the enlarged and always growing 
Orphanage. + 
Besides literary instruction, the boys are trained in manual labor and 
the girls in domestic duties. 
HOLY COMMUNION CHURCH INSTITUTE. 
This school was founded through the noble efforts of the Rev. Dr. 
Porter, of the Episcopal Church, in 1867, in memory of a bright, promis- 
ing son who had died a short time previously. He designed to estab- 
lish a classical school for the children of parents in straitened circum- 
stances. His efforts to continue the school and educate the children 
thus confided to him furnish a rare example of Christian faith and per- 
severance. He visited city after city, preaching in the different pulpits, 
meeting with rebuffs and refusals, enduring insults, trudging till late 
at night through the snow and sleet of northern winters; but his con- 
victions of the duty he had undertaken never weakened. His appeals 
met with a generous response, since up to 1883 about $150,000, nearly 
half of the funds necessary for the undertaking, had been contributed 
by friends in the North and England.!

MANUAL LABOR SCHOOLS. 
During the decade from 1$30 to 1840 the whole country was greatly 
stirred by a new educational movement in favor of manual labor 
schools. In North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, the experiment 
was made timeandagain. In 1834, at the Donaldson Academy in North 
Carolina, such a school was started under the auspices of the Fayette- 
ville Presbytery. The enterprise was put “under the charge of the 
Rey. Dr. Simeon Colton, who was a man of extensive acquirements, 
great energy, and knew something about almost everything that ought 
to be taught in such a school. He had been in charge for a number of 
years of a similar school at Amherst in Massachusetts, and was said to 
have managed it with great success.” The number of students rose to 
one hundred and fifty-five ina short time, yet this feature was dropped 
at the end of the second year. Dr. Colton seemed to think that “close 
habits of study and manual labor were incompatible.” In 1838 David- 
son College, in North Carolina, was established under the control of 
two presbyteries, and yet their wealth and numbers failed to hold this 
manual labor feature longer than three years; most of the students 
were sons of farmers, and many learned to work in the field before 
going to college. It was not, therefore, that they thought the work 
dishonorable, but that they felt it to be a loss of time to cut wood and 
hold the plow while at college. And this seemed to be the opinion of 
most of the students at these schools. The experiment was made at 
Wake Forest College, in North Carolina, with the same results.? 
In South Carolina the first manual labor school in the United States 
was founded on the bequest of Dr. John De La Howe, of Abbeville 
County, who in 1796 left the bulk of his property for the purpose of 
establishing an agricultural school. In the various reports on the free- 
school system of South Carolina, made by the different commissioners in 
1839, one believed in the efficacy of manual labor” schocls as a solution 
of the problem. But the committee composed of Messrs. Thornwell and 
Hlliott discarded this system as “egregious failures in almost every in- 
stance.” The plan was also tried at Cokesbury by the Methodists, at 
Erskine by the Associate Reformed Presbyterians, at Furman Univer- 
sity by the Baptists, and at Pendleton by “ working citizens,” and with 
the same result in all,—failure and complete abandonment of it.

  CHAPTER III. 
COLLEGIATE EDUCATION, 
The first traces of collegiate education in South Carolina are found 
in the House Journals of 1723, where it is recorded that Rev. Thomas 
Morrit made proposals for establishing a college. For want of funds, 
chiefly, nothing came of it, but it is interesting to know that this is the 
first time that the word ‘“ college” appears in the history of the State. 
There is no authentic record of any other attempt until 1769, when a 
bill was drawn (largely in John Rutledge’s handwriting), providing for 
the establishment of a college, which was to be named the College of 
South Carolina. After providing for public schools, the bill makes pro- 
vision for the following corps of instructors: A president, who shall 
be professor of divinity, moral philosophy, and of Greek and Hebrew, 
with a salary of £350. sterling per annum; a professor of civil and 
common law, and of the municipal laws of the province, with a 
salary of 4200; a professor of physic, anatomy, botany, and chem- 
istry, £200; a professor of mathematics, and of natural and ex- 
perimental philosophy, £200; a professor cf history, chronology, 
and the modern languages, £200; and it was also provided that the 
president should be a member of the Church of England.’ It was 
probably due to the excitement of the coming conflict with the mother 
country that nothing came of this bill. But it was an advanced scheme 
for the times, and it was, in fact, on a broader plan than several of the 
colleges in the State to-day. 
In 1785, as if to make amends for their delay, the Legislature passed 
an act for erecting and establishing three colleges, one at Charleston, 
one at Winnsborough, and the third at Ninety-Six. The one at Winns- 
borough was to be a “college for the education of youth in the learned 
and foreign languages, and in the liberal arts and sciences.”? Besides 
the usual regulations, it was enacted that “no person shall be eligible 
as a trustee of the said colleges unless he shall profess the Christian 
Protestant religion.” In 1795 an act was passed for incorporating a 
fourth college at Beaufort, and in 1797 a fifth college was incorporated 
in Pinckney District, as the ‘ College of Alexandria.” 
Of three of these colleges, no traces remain; the one at Charleston 
is still in existence, while that at Winnsborough lives as an academy.

52
-P-A-G-E-55
  COLLEGIATE EDUCATION. 53 
Of the two latter, one gave diplomas for the first few years, while the 
institution in Charleston did not claim to be a college until after 1825. 
There were no means for collegiate instruction until the establishment 
of the South Carolina College in 1801, the history of which is given 
elsewhere. 
INFLUENCE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. 
The influence exercised by the University of Virginia on southern 
thought, life, and institutions, has never been fully recognized, and 
probably never can be, since it has become woven into the warp and 
woof of society. In South Carolina the influence is very clearly seen 
in the adoption of the independent school system, like that of this 
greatest southern school. Furman University, one of whose professors 
is a graduate of the University of Virginia, has maintained the system 
for many years. At one time two out of her five professors had re- 
ceived their diplomas at the University of Virginia. Two of the female 
colleges are also organized on this plan, as was the Southern Baptist 
Theological Seminary (now at Louisville, Ky.), whose very popular 
professor, and a leading preacher in the Southern Baptist Church, Dr. 
John A. Broadus, is a graduate of the University of Virginia. Wofford 
also adopted the system, and so did the State institution when merged 
into a university in 1865. One of her ablest professors, Charles Ven- 
able, was also from this great sister University. In onerespect, per- 
haps, the Virginia school copied after that of South Carolina. The 
high sense of honor among the students at both places is proverbial 
throughout the South to-day, and this was doubtless firmly established 
at Columbia before Jefferson founded his institution. The whole tend- 
ency in these colleges is now towards the imitation of the spirit and 
life of this latter; the ambition of the students is to join some class 
there, and the professors strive to make their courses as advanced as 
that in the University of Virginia. Most of them also draw a distine- 
tion between the A. B. and A. M. degrees, making the requirements 
for the latter much higher than for the former. 
RESULTS OF THE WAR. 
Leaving out the loss of the endowments, one of the worst results of 
the Civil War was the lowering of the standard in the colleges. This 
was unavcidable, since the means of preparation for college were swept 
away with the destruction of the system of academies. 
The endowments were all swept away. Wofford, Furman, Newberry, 
and Erskine, all lost the generous gifts of years. The attendance of 
students also fell off. The college at Columbia has suffered but little 
from reduction of students, although some of the others have hardly 
one-half their former number. Besides the loss of the college endow- 
ments, the funds of most of the charitable schools, received in colonial
-P-A-G-E-56
a 
54 HIGHER EDUCATION IN SOUTH CAROLINA. 
times, were also swept away. The loss of libraries, as those of the 
‘Winyaw Indigo Society and Mount Zion, was also considerable. Build- 
ings in some of the schools of the second class were also destroyed. 
But one of the most disastrous effects was the destruction of public 
and private libraries. Many of the planters were men of taste and 
wealth, who had spent much time and money in making fine collec- 
tions of costly volumes, rare manuscripts, and pamphlets illustrating 
local life and habits. On the approach of the invading army the owners 
were forced to flee and leave their valuable collections at the merey of 
ignorant slaves. Books were destroyed and carried away, and bonfires 
were kindled with fine plates and old folios. There are instances re- 
lated where, on the coast of South Carolina, libraries of six or eight 
thousand volumes were destroyed, only two or three hundred being 
saved from the general wreck. 
THEOLOGICAL SEMINARIES. 
Two denominations in South Carolina have had separate theological 
seminaries, and a third has attached such a department to its college 
proper. Tbe Baptists for several years maintained at Greenville a 
seminary for training young men for the ministry, and the Presby- 
terians had a similar institution at Columbia. The Associate Re- 
formed Presbyterians have supported a theological department in 
connection with Erskine College. The Baptist theological institution, 
which was the outgrowth of Furman University, was organized jin. 
1858. The Baptist denomination offered $100,000 on condition that 
it be located within the borders of South Carolina. It was established 
within the State, at Greenville, where it remained until 1876, when it 
was removed to Louisville, Ky. This is the seminary of the Southern 
Baptist Convention. 
The seminary of the Southern Presbyterian Church is located at Co- 
lumbia. It was in this school that the Rey. James Woodrow taught 
the system of evolution, for which he was tried for heresy. He was 
remoyed from the faculty, and the final appeal was made to the 
General Assembly of the Church for the decision of the case. This 
body met in Baltimore in the latter part of May, 1888, and finally 
decided against him by a large majority. 
In addition to these theological seminaries there is the Benedict In- 
stitute at Columbia for training colored youths for the ministry of the 
Baptist Church. It is largely supported by northern donations. 
A theological seminary was organized by the convention of the dio- 
cese of the Protestant Episcopal Church in 1857, with the Right Rev. 
Thomas I’. Davis, the Rev. Thomas I’. Davis, Jr., D.D., the Rev. Paul 
Trapier, and the Rev. Stuart Hanckell, D.D., as professors. It was 
located at Camden, and the buildings were erected during the next 
year; the school went into successful operation, and was continued 
until 1865, when the main building and the greater part of the library
-P-A-G-E-57
COLLEGIATE EDUCATION. 65 
were destroyed by fire in February, during the occupancy of Camden 
by the Federal troops. 
A noble-hearted layman, owning the grounds and buildings known 
as Saint John’s College, in Spartanburg, presented them to the diocese 
for the seminary, and in October, 1866, the school was reopened at that 
place; but on account of the losses sustained during the War, in the 
destruction of church property and the failure of investments, it was 
found that the diocese was too poor to pay the professors and aid the 
students, and in Uctober, 1868, the seminary was suspended. The dio- 
cese still owns the grounds and buildings, but the latter are falling into 
decay, and the trustees propose to sell if they can get a fair price.

CHAPTER IV. 
EDUCATIONAL AND CHARITABLE INSTITUTIONS OF 
CHARLESTON. — 
THE COLLEGE OF CHARLESTON. 
The beginnings of the College of Charleston may be traced to June, 
1770. At tlis time a meeting was held to consider the propriety of 
“petitioning the Assembly for the establishment of a college in or near 
Charleston.”' But owing to the excitement caused by the Revolution 
nothing was done toward its foundation until. the close of the war, 
except donations and bequests by private citizens for a college to be 
established in the future. These gifts commenced in 1772 and con- 
tinued up to the final establishment of the college, and amounted to 
£10,500, besides books. One man, John McKenzie, gave 1,200 volumes, 
and others that are not known gave many more. With the most of the 
donors—seven in all—it was a favorite notion to locate the institution 
in or near Charleston, but one or two of them rose superior to this 
loeal pride and stipulated for its location in the country or province. 
With these beginnings, it was easier to induce the Legislature to grant 
the charter. In 1785 the charter was granted, not only for this college, 
but for two others at the same time, one at Cambridge and the other at 
Winnsborough. The one at Cambridge never went any further; that at 
Winnsborough, Mount Zion, is still maintained as a respectable training 
school. The funds which had been bequeathed for a college were thus * 
divided among three institutions. The feeling between the “up-coun- 
try” and the “low-country” is seen thus early in the history of the 
State, and continues to this day, though its sharpness has worn off. 
The act,’ after reciting that “it is much desired by many well-disposed 
persons that a public seminary of learning for the education of youth 
should be establishéd in or near Charleston,” provided for the appoint- 
ment of twenty-three trustees, including the Governor and Lieutenant- 
Governor. Under the act eight and seven-eighths acres, called “free- 
school” land, were given to the Charleston College, bounded by Bound- 
ary, Philip, Coming, and St. George Streets, in the central part of the 
city.

THE COLLEGE OF CHARLESTON. 57 
If this land could have been saved for the college, it would have far- 
nished a large income, but three-fourths of it was soon sold for debts 
incurred by bad management. For several years nothing further seems 
to have been done. 
‘ORGANIZATION UNDER REV. ROBERT SMITH. 
In 1791 a new charter was granted, since there were doubts as to the 
construction of the triple act, and because of the “many inconveniences 
in carrying into execution the act of 1785,” as to the election of officers 
and meetings of the trustees. 
The trustees commenced work by electing Rev. Robert Smith, after- 
wards bishop, principal of the college. He moved his flourishing school 
for boys into the “long, narrow, and low brick range which was origi- 
nally erected and used for soldiers’ barracks during the Revolution, and 
the college commenced operations.” He managed the school until 1797, 
not teaching himself, but providing “able and efficient teachers.” His 
Latin teacher, Mr. Coffee, was fond of mechanics, and ‘ constructed a 
model of Czsar’s bridge across the Rhine.” Another assistant, Dr. 
Gallagher, “ was a man of genius and of taste,” and by “his talents and 
learning gave it the practical characteristics of a college.” The boys 
read Livy in Latin, and Homer in Greek, went through six books of 
Kuclid, studied surveying, navigation, something of geography, astron- 
omy, natural philosophy, English, and declamation. A Latin prayer 
was read in the morning, and an English one in the evening. It fur 
nished the highest grade of instruction in the. State so far as is known. 
3ub it was no more than a respectable grammar school, although digni- 
fied with the name of college. Even the principal sent his sons to the 
North for their education. 
During the term of Dr. Smith the degree of A. B. was conferred on 
six graduates, one of whom, Nathaniel Bowen, afterwards became bishop 
of the diocese. So elementary was the work required for this degree, 
that one of the graduates said that ‘ the whole thing was absurd.” The 
oldest of them was only eighteen, and the highest authors read were 
Homer and Livy. Joseph Alston, who afterwards married Theodosia 
Burr, and became Governor of South Carolina, was a student there, as 
were also Thomas Bennett, William Lowndes, Judge John S. Richard- 
son, aud Joseph Duncan. - 
Under Dr. Smith’s management the institution became burdened with 
debt, and the most of the land was sold. After his resignation in 1797, 
even this grammar school was lost, since no school was maintained there 
for any length of time until the revival of the institution in 1823 or 1824. 
Yet if must not be supposed that the young were cut off from educa- 
tional facilities; for a large number were taught at private schools, 
while a great many went to the South Carolina College, some to the 
North, a few to Europe.

VARIOUS TEACHERS TO 1824. 
Thomas Bee, a man of fine literary reputation, from Oxford, England, 
undertook to supervise the school, after the resignation of Dr. Smith, 
until he could get over some one from Bton capable of managing “a 
grammar school.” Afterward Rev. George Buist, pastor of the First 
Presbyterian Church in Charleston, was elected in 1805, and moved his 
large school there. 
There were two courses of study, one in science and literature, the 
other in English and modern languages. The studies were no more 
advanced than under Dr. Smith, and no class rose higher than Sopho- 
more. Among the studies political economy was mentioned, but it 1s 
impossible to know the character of the instruction given in it. After 
Rev. Mr. Buist, as far as can be learned, Rey. Mr. Malcolmsen, Dr. Rat- 
toon, Mr. Mitchell King, Mr. Abiel Bolles, Mr. Wood Furman, and Mr. 
Anderson, in turn, had the management of the school. 
After 1811 the college classes were altogether discontinued, private 
schools only being kept there. Of these, probably the best was that of 
Mr. Hurlbut, whose two sons have become prominent. William Henry 
Hurlbut was a very quick, bright boy, and became a leading journalist 
and editor of the New York World. His brother, Stephen Augustus 
Hurlbut, was somewhat slower in apprehension. He left the city on the 
advice of Mr. Petigru in 1845 for Illinois, entered politics, rose to the 
rank of major-general in the Civil War, was elected to Congress, and 
was sent as minister to the United States of Colombia and Peru, where 
he died in 1882. He was with Sherman’s army in its march through 
the State in 1865. 
REY. JASPER ADAMS. 
Bishop Bowen tried to revive the college in 1824, but not much was 
done towards its revival until the coming of Rev. Jasper Adams, the 
professor of mathematics and natural philosophy at Brown University. 
In their letter the trustees stated that ‘there was a college in Charles- 
ton; its endowment, however, was small; and by bad management has 
been reduced to nothing.” The offer of/two thousand five hundred dol- 
lars a year and the benefit of a warmer climate induced him to accept: 
On his arrival several ambitious young physicians wished to found a 
medical school in connection with the college, but the conservatism of 
the trustees declined the offer. A few years afterwards it was founded 
on an independent basis, became the Medical College of Charleston, 
and the College of Charleston lost the opportunity of having a medical 
department annexed to it. 
Mr. Adams was very ambitious to enlarge the course, but he found 
the trustees and citizens bitterly opposed to the measure. It was im- 
practicable and antagonistic to the interests of the South Carolina Col- 
lege. Several of the most influential trustees resigned afterwards, when
-P-A-G-E-61
THE COLLEGE OF CHARLESTON. 59 
they saw the plan would be adopted. Even one of the professors op- 
posed it as unpropitious. ‘The college was without funds, without 
suitable buildings, without reputation, and without prospects.” Its 
reputation was wide enough, but it was questionable. One of the citi- 
zens wrote that, “from former associations, the neighbors shuddered 
at having it recommenced.” But Adams was invincible. At last the 
trustees graciously allowed him to do the work on his own responsi- 
bility. A new building had to be erected. The trustees met this with 
the statement: “All the great schools in England, such as Eton and 
Westminster, were kept in old abbeys, which were not as good as the 
college buildings—in truth, they were good enough.” 
At last the professors had to take the pecuniary responsibility on them- 
selves. Adams worked like a galley slave; heard four or five recita- 
tions daily, managed the general affairs, and canvassed for subscriptions. 
The money was promised, but still the trustees grumbled. They were 
confident that the subscriptions would not be paid, but when met with 
the assertion that the subscribers were honorable citizens and would 
meet their obligations, they yielded. By this time Adams was so 
wearied with the struggle that he resigned and went to Geneva, N. Y. 
The trustees now saw what they had lost by their opposition, and took 
steps the next year to recall him. But Adams was now master, and 
he let them know on what terms he would return. His terms were prac- 
tically accepted, and the trustees offered a salary of two thousand five 
hundred dollars, expenses of remoyal of his family, and laid the cor- 
ner-stone of the new building which cost $25,000. 
ORGANIZATION OF THE COLLEGE. 
Adams returned and opened the school in April, 1827, with a professor 
of Greek, of Latin, of mathematics and natural philosophy, four tutors, 
and an assistant in French, The management of the college was a 
marvel of business success, and it was maintained almost exclusively 
by tuition fees, which averaged for ten years eleven thousand dollars, 
and at one time amounted to a surplus of five thousand dollars. 
In 1828 the college was re-organized into three departments, English, 
classical, and scientifie. There had béen great dissatisfaction at the 
slight attention paid to the study of English, andit was demanded that 
this should be remedied, as had been done in some of the Northern col- 
leges. Of the college course now provided, a writer in a Boston maga- 
zine said: “ The regular course of studies, it will be perceived, is as ex- 
tensive as that pursued at any of our colleges.” ! 
COURSE OF STUDY. 
The English department was mainly preparatory, embracing the or- 
dinary English branches, elements of mathematics, themes, and decla- 
  
‘American Journal of Education, Vol. III, p. 553 (1828).

mation. The classical course covered the usual authors, Caesar, Vir- 
gil, Sallust, Cicero (select orations and two philosophical writings), 
Horace, Livy (five books), Juvenal, Persius, Tacitus, Jacob’s Greek 
Reader, Graeca Majora (first volume, and to the end of Medea in sec- 
ond), and four gospels inGreek. The scientific students studied calcu- 
lus, navigation, surveying, construction of mathematical instruments, 
and physics. Other studies required of all were the following: logic 
(Hedge, and Watts’s Improvement of the Mind), Porter’s Analysis, 
Blaix’s Lectures, Paley’s Moral and Political Philosophy, and Evidences 
of Christianity, Intellectual Philosophy, Vattel’s Law of Nations, But- 
ler’s Analogy, Pitkin’s History of the United States, and Constitu- 
tional Law in the United States, in Story’s Abridgement. Scientific 
students were required to know French, in order that text-books in that 
language could be used. Political economy was required of all in the 
English and scientific departments. The degree of A. B. was given to 
those who went through the classical and scientific departments, while 
certificates only were given to the English students. Students were 
under the control of officers while they were on the college grounds, 
and they usually remained in college seven hours daily. The number 
of students rose from one hundred and nineteen to two hundred and 
twenty and remained about that number for several years. 
ATTEMPT TO FORM A COLLEGE PROPER. 
Another opportunity about this time was given for the college to be- 
come an important institution in the State. Under the presidency of 
Thomas Cooper, the South Carolina College had been almost ruined, 
The religious people of the State hesitated about sending their sons to it, 
Adams saw the chance for the Charleston College, and wished to cut off 
the preparatory department. In 1832 there were sixty students in the 
college proper, but many more in the other departments. Adams ad- 
dressed @ memorial to the trustees, urging that these two departments 
(English and scientific) be abolished. But the conservative trustees 
refused, and “by their refusal disappointed the students, the faculty, 
and the public,” and from this time the college declined. The trustees 
themselves either sent their sons to the South Carolina College, by rea- 
son of the supposed political advantage to be gained by it, or to the 
North for better training. Thomas Y. Grimké at this time made his 
famous attack on the study of the classics, and the discussion that arose 
from it made another obstacle to the establishment of a college with a 
classical course only. 
The South Carolina College was soon re-organized, and the last chance 
for supremacy of the Charleston College was gone forever, when Adams 
left in 1836.1

Register, Vol. XII, p. 164 (1839).

THE COLLEGE OF CHARLESTON. 61 
SUMMARY OF REV. J. ADAMS’S WORK. 
His ability is shown in the results of his labors; he found the insti- 
tution an inferior grammar school, and he left it with an advanced col- 
legiate branch. The number of pupils had risen from one hundred and 
nineteen to two hundred and twenty, with an average yearly increase 
of income from tuition of six thousand dollars; twenty-five thousand 
dollars, the most of which had come from the increased amount from 
tuition fees, and the rest raised through subscriptions by his exertions, 
had been spent in buildings and other improvements. All the expenses 
of improvements and the salaries of the professors were paid from tuition 
fees, and yet at one time there was a surplus of five thousand dollars. 
The whole number of pupils during his thirteen years’ presidency was 
nearly eight hundred, while the number of graduates was sixty-one. 
Fourteen of these entered the ministry, and one of them, Rev. Daniel 
Corbin, attained some prominence in his profession, leaving a volume 
of sermons behind him. He in common with many others was a benefi- 
ciary at the college. The first degree was conferred in 1825 on Alexan- 
der Gadsden, and the next year on Bishop Wightman. 
RE-ORGANIZATION UNDER CONTROL OF CITY COUNCIL. 
‘Up to the War of Independence the aristocratic youth of Charleston 
had been educated in England, and had brought back with them a 
fondness for things English. This feeling was sufficiently strong in 
the early organization of the college, when a majority of the governing 
class were of English education, to model the course of study on the 
English system, with a preponderance of the classics and mathematics. 
The course in mathematics has been very advanced down to the pres- 
enttime. But along with this feeling was another, to make the institu- 
tion a “ home college,” “ for the benefit of those youths of the city and 
neighborhood whose parents were unable to send them away.”! The 
Hon. W. D. Porter, in his alumni address in 1871, said: “ We find it to 
have been the predominant and prevailing purpose of the trustees to 
foster a complete system of domestic education, and to this end, to 
establish on a permanent basis a home college.” It was never intended 
at any period to be a rival of the South Carolina College, and the trust- 
ees have steadily kept this aim in view, as distinctly appears several 
times in the history of the college. 
This adherence to the English system, and the feeling of local pride, 
combined to render the school peculiarly fitted for Charleston, and it 
was probably these two influences that induced the City Council to as- 
sume control of the college. Adams, having failed to move the trustees 
to establish a college proper, again returned to the North, and the 
school seemed likely to relapse to the old condition. At this juncture

the Council deemed the re-organization to be of “momentous conse- 
quences to the citizens of Charleston,” and proposed to confer with the 
trustees for this purpose. The outcome of the conferences was that in 
1837 the city assumed control of the college, being charged to meet the 
necessary expenses, while the trustees were to be elected by the coun- 
cil. Two years later it was provided that an annual appropriation of 
$1,000 should be made for the college purposes, since, as the ordinance 
declared, “ the College of Charleston is intimately connected with the 
intellectual improvement and moral welfare of the youth of our city, 
and deserves to be cherished with a wise and liberal patronage in order 
to extend the sphere of its usefulness.” The institution has remained in 
the charge of the city to the present. The appropriations for the col- 
lege have varied at different periods, in its early years being much more 
than now, since the interest from endowments at present almost meets 
the expenses. 
One result of the control by the city has been the attention paid to 
modern languages. In 1867, by a special ordinance, the sum of two 
thousand dollars yearly was appropriated for a chair of modern lan- 
guages and for no other purpose. Nothing was passed under this or- 
dinance until 1877, when the trustees established the chair. In this 
way the modern languages have received equal recognition with the 
ancient. But in 1880 this special fund was stopped, as an instructor 
was engaged at half the amount before given. The annual appropri- 
ations for all purposes by the city have reached as high as five thou- 
sand doliars, but for the last several years only two thousand five 
hundred dollars. 
INVESTED ENDOWMENTS. 
The early gifts of books and money have already been referred to, 
but the later donations show the spirit and pride of the people in the 
institution. . 
The Hon. Elias Horry, in 1828, established an annuity on his personal 
bond of ten thousand dollars, yielding five hundred dollars yearly, for 
founding a professorship, and he paid this for thirty-five years, paying 
in all seventeen thousand five hundred dollars in interest alone. 
In 1847 a popular subscription was undertaken to found a chair of 
history and belles-lettres. It was responded to with twenty-one thou- 
sand three hundred and forty-six dollars from one hundred and fifty 
subscribers, in sums ranging from five to two thousand dollars. 
In 1856 the Hon. Ker Boyce gave thirty-three thousand dollars to 
endow eight scholarships for meritorious, needy young men. Both of 
these latter funds were preserved almost untouched through the War, 
and are now used for the original purposes. 
But the greatest contribution, probably, ever made in the State to a 
public purpose, was that of Ephraim M. Baynard, to the college in 1865. 
He was a wealthy planter, and realized the need of educational facili-   
 
-P-A-G-E-65
THE COLLEGE OF CHARLESTON. 63 
ties, and he set aside one hundred and sixty-eight thousand two hun- 
dred dollars for the college. The interest from this is more than half 
of the current funds of the institution. 
In addition to these, there were gifts from Governor Aiken, Charles 
Fraser, Mrs. Kohn, and many others. The library is very largely com- 
posed of books presented by Judge Mitchell King, Dr. Frampton, and 
others. It now has about 10,000 volumes; but owing to want of 
means, very few additions have been made in late years, except through 
donations, Some of the works are very rare and valuable. 
Very little aid has been derived from tuition fees in late years, as 
they are only forty dollars per scholar, and the number of students is 
small, In 1885 the entire income of the college was thirteen thousand 
three hundred and twenty-seven, dollars from an endowment of three 
hundred thousand dollars. Of this income only three hundred and forty 
dollars came from tuition. The salary of the full professors is two thou- 
sand dollars each, while the president’s is two thousand five hundred 
dollars. 
SKETCH OF ITS HISTORY SINCE 1837. 
After the re-organization of the college Dr. William Brantly was 
elected president, and remained at the head of the institution till his 
death in 1845. During his last illness the office of president was tem- 
porarily held by Hon. Mitchell King. Afterward W. Peronneau Fin- 
ley was elected and served till his resignation in 1857, N. R. Middle- 
ton then filled the place to 1880, when the present president, Dr. H. E. 
Shepherd, was inaugurated. 
With Dr, Brantly there were associated four professors. The at- 
tendance was small, there having been in the first years only twenty or 
thirty students. There were still three departments and four classes. 
The grade of the work done may be inferred from the requirements for 
admission to the Freshman class; in Latin, the whole of Casar’s Com- 
-mentaries, Virgil, Cicero’s Select Orations, and Sallust, and “an ac- 
curate and minute knowledge of the Latin grammar ;” in Greek, Valpy’s 
Grammar and Jacob’s Reader. The course of the collegiate work has 
been quiet but progressive during the years since the re-organization, 
with an average attendance of not over seventy; even the excitement 
of the siege did not close the doors until 1865. It was the only college 
in the State that did not suspend exercises during the stormy years of 
the War. 
There have been but few changes in the staff of professors since 1838, 
the whole number being only thirteen: L. R. Gibbes, William Hawks- 
worth, William Hume, W. P. Miles, Rev. John Bachman, I. S. Holmes, 
Frederick A. Porcher, H. M. Bruns, J. W. Miles, John McCrady, F. W. 
Capers, A, Sachtleben, and 8. Primer. All have been efficient for their 
respective duties, and some have become prominent in their Gepart- 
ments. N, R, Middleton was a man of broad general culture. Lewis 
 
-P-A-G-E-66

R. Gibbes possesses fine scientific attainments, and his investigations 
have attracted very favorable notice in the scientific world. He is 
president of the Elliott Society of Science and Art, and is one of the 
most accomplished men of science in the Southern States. William 
Porcher Miles was also the president of South Carolina College for two 
years preceding Mr. McBryde, and resigned to accept important pri- 
vate trusts in Louisiana. Rev. John Bachman and Prof. Francis 8. 
Holmes were of great assistance in collecting the specimens for the 
Museum. Professors Satchleben and Primer have done excellent work 
in their departments, and traces of their labors may be seen in the phi- 
lological journals, and in their editions of the ancient and classical 
texts. To Professor Holmes belongs the honor of the first discovery 
and early development of the phosphate deposits of the State, which 
have added so much to the wealth of South Carolina in the last few 
years. 
Frederick A. Porcher, who died in Charleston October 15, 1888, was 
a famous and most successful student and instructor in belles-lettres 
and history for nearly forty years; a writer of exquisite taste, a his- 
torian of unwearied labor in research and consummate skill in narra- 
tive, a master of all the arts of conversation, an enlightened legislator, 
and an accomplished gentleman in every relation of his long life; his 
death was an irreparable loss to the college and to the city with which 
so much of his labor and love were associated. 
HENRY E. SHEPHERD, LL. D. 
The gentleman who now fills the president’s chair, Mr. Henry E. 
Shepherd, was born in North Carolina in 1845. He was educated at 
the University of Virginia, and has spent a large part of his life in Bal- 
timore, where he occupied the office of superintendent of public instrue- 
tion from 1875 to 1882. Becoming wearied with political interference in 
school matters, he resigned and accepted the presidency of the Col- 
lege of Charleston. His special field is the English language and litera- 
ture, and his various publications are well known both in Europe and 
in America. He has been engaged to fill places at the great summer 
institutes in New England, and his papers before the new but impor- 
tant Modern Language Association have been heard with attention. 
At the last session in Philadelphia, he read a paper on Macaulay’s 
style. His work in strengthening and improving the college has been 
very valuable. | 
SCHOLARSHIPS. 
As has been seen above the Hon. Ker Boyce gave thirty-three thou- 
sand dollars for endowing eight scholarships. By judicious manage. 
ment this was increased to thirty five thousand dollars by the close of 
the War, and is now invested in four per cent. city bonds, Aid is

distributed to needy or meritorious students, under the direction and 
supervision of the descendant of the donor. 
In addition to the above, it was provided by ordinance, May 6, 1839, 
that pupils from the Orphan House should be admitted to the college’ 
free of charge. The trustees have also recently offered free tuition to 
every pupil of the high school of Charleston who graduates from that 
school with a prescribed degree of scholarship, and free honorary schol- 
arships are also provided for meritorious pupils from the public schools, 
and the Central and German Academies.! 
PROFESSOR AGASSI4 AND THE MUSEUM. 
The museum of natural history is one of the finest features of the col- 
lege, and is without doubt one of the best to be found south of Wash- © 
ington. Additional interest attaches to it from the fact that its origin 
is due to Professor Agassiz. Professor Agassiz’s connection with it is 
well told by Dr. Manigault, the present curator of the Museum. 
“Prof. Louis Agassiz came to America for the first time in the 
autumn of 1846, and soon after delivered in Boston his first course of 
Lowell Lectures. His first visit to Charleston, 8. C., was in Febru- 
ary, 1849, when he delivered his lectures on the glaciers of Switzer- 
land, and ths phenomena connected with their former greater extension. 
He had already formed the acquaintance and friendship of Prof. J. E. 
Holbrook, the author of a well-known work on the Herpetology of North 
America, who was engaged then on the study of the fishes of South 
Carolina, and was his guest while in Charleston. 
“ During his stay in that city he became acquainted with several of 
its leading citizens, and, through the exertions of Professor Holbrook, 
arrangements were made to have him deliver a course of lectures at 
the Medical College on comparative anatomy, between the months of 
November and March of each year. 
“These were not commenced until the winter of 1851-52, when the 
course was completely delivered, and they were commenced again the 
following year at the appointed time. In December following, however, 
he was seized with a severe illness which lasted several weeks, and the 
recovery from which was so slow that he was prevented from resuming 
the lectures at the college. To make up, after regaining his strength, 
for his inability to comply with the terms of the agreement, he deliv- 
ered, during the month of March and part of April, a course of lectures 
to the general public on various botanical subjects. The lectures were 
well attended and to a great extent by the ladies of the city, who 
seemed to take an interest in the subjects he explained. 
“Tt was during those lectures that Professor Agassiz was scen to 
advantage, and his usual position on the raised platform of the hall was 
a facing the audience and half turned towards the blackboard, when,

with a piece of chalk held in the right hand, he illustrated what he 
was lecturing upon. His appearance when thus occupied, making 
drawings of leaves and other parts of plants on the blackboard, was a 
novel one, and is remembered to this day. His proficiency in English, 
too, was a subject of astonishment. 
“Professor Agassiz, while in South Carolina, visited several places 
along the coast at various distances from Charleston. His opportuni- 
ties for observing the marine fauna of the region were new to him, and 
he availed himself of them to investigate both the vertebrate and in- 
vertebrate animals which came to his notice. On the authority of 
Prof. Francis 8. Holmes, of Charleston, it may be mentioned that, 
previous to his stay in Charleston, he had doubted the existence of an 
ovoviviparous shark, and Professor Holmes was able to show him one 
which he had captured in the harbor, and which contained the living 
young in the body. He was surprised likewise at discovering that the 
devil-fish of that coast (ceratoptera vampirus), a gigantic species of 
ray, was altogether viviparous in the production of its young, a birth 
having oceurred with a captured specimen while he was near by. 
“ He found himself in very congenial company in Charleston. He 
accepted many invitations to different kinds of entertainments, and, 
without evincing any inclination to dancing, participated largely in 
the pleasures of the young. His association with the highly refined 
and educated circles of the city made a favorable impression upon him, 
and he was disposed to make it his permanent residence during the 
winter, if sufficient pecuniary inducements could be offered him. The 
difficulties in the way were that, as a professor at the medical college, 
his lectures on comparative anatomy were outside of the curriculum of 
such an institution, and the students who intended to practise medicine 
had as much as they could do to attend to the lectures which belonged 
strictly to the course. It was found, therefore, that the interest in his 
lectures flagged, and the attendance diminished toward their close. 
“ There had been a decided interest taken in Charleston in the nat- 
ural history of the two highest classes of vertebrates—mammals and 
birds, at one time when Audubon was preparing his great work on 
the birds of North America, and later, when the Rev. John Bachman, 
of Charleston, was his co-laborer in this work on the quadrupeds of 
America. At that time there existed in that city a philosophical so- 
ciety modelled after the onein Philadelphia, and among their collections 
were a large number of animals and birds, carefully mounted for exhibi- 
tion, which were located in a small wooden building standing in the 
yard of the medical college, in that part of the lot now -included in the 
area occupied by the Roper Hospital. 
“Tn 1852 the little museum was in an almost abandoned condition, 
and there was no one strictly in charge. It was going to ruin rap- 
idly. Agassiz’s attention was directed to it, and he examined the con- 
tents with interest. It so happened that during that year the two

wings to the College of Charleston were completed, and no decision 
had been arrived at as to. the purpose to which the upper floor of the 
entire building should be devoted. It was therefore suggested that it 
should be utilized for the purpose of founding a museum of natural 
history. 
“The trustees of the college and the city government were consulted, 
and the former agreed to the proposed destination, while the latter ap- 
propriated the funds necessary for the fitting up of the cases. 
“The collection at the Medical College was then removed to the Col- 
lege of Charleston as a nucleus of a larger museum, a competent taxi- 
dermist was employed to overhaul the specimens, and at the end of 
March the museum was inaugurated with an address by Professor 
Agassiz in the chapel of the college. : 
“The first curator appointed was Prof. F. 8S. Holmes. His studies 
had been mainly in geology and paleontology under Mr. Tuomey, who at 
one time was the geologist of the State; a chair for instruction in those 
two branches was established, with the salary paid by an annual appro- 
priation made by the City Council, and Mr. Holmes was also elected to 
that position. 
“Professor Agassiz thus gave an impetus to the study of natural his- 
' tory in Charleston which was similar to what occurred in other cities 
which he visited, and he can justly be considered as having founded 
the museum in that city. It was thought at first that he would con- 
tinue to visit Charleston every winter, and in that case his lectures would 
have been delivered at the college. But he concluded before leaving 
that a southern winter was not sufficiently invigorating for his robust 
constitution, and substantial offers having soon after been made to him 
to locate permanently in Cambridge, Mass., he fixed his abode there, 
and soon succeeded in starting the Museum of Comparative Zodlogy.” 
WORK OF THE COLLEGE. 
The number of its graduates is three hundred and sixty-eight up to 
1885. This is due to the fact that its patronage is nearly all from the 
low country. Of its graduates to 1870, forty-two were lawyers, thirty- 
two physicians, thirty-two merchants, and twenty-three clergymen, be- 
sides many teachers. In the list will be found the names of those who 
have led public opinion in the city for many years. Among those who 
have attained distinction in professional and political life may be men- 
tioned Joseph Aleston, Thomas Bennett, Daniel Elliott Huger, Rev. 
Dr. Palmer, John 8. Richardson, Dr. Joseph Johnson, Joseph Duncan, 
William D. Porter, Dr. John Dickson Bruns, Paul Hamilton Hayne, 
John Hamkel, and Henry D. Lesesne. 
One of the most widely known of its graduates is J. D. B. De Bow, 
who attracted notice at college, with his keen, black, sparkling eyes— 
“ready for any discussion or intellectual tilt, one of the great thinkers

and actors of the South.” He carried off first honors in 1843, having 
gone through the course in three years. In the great conflict since the 
adoption of the Constitution between the North and South, the south- 
ern orators had always held their own; but there was a great and ery- 
ing need of a southern writer, a vigorous controversialist, who could 
cope with the writers of the North. De Bow came nearer supplying this 
need in the Commercial, and afterward in his own Review, from 1844 to 
1860, than any other man. His periodical was filled with vigorous po- 
lemical articles on the history and statistics of the two sections. He 
could treat grave constitutional questions and questions of national 
issue in an able, dignified manner, and always present tlie southern 
side of the matter in the strongest light. He was appointed chief of 
the United States Census in 1850. His Review was the highest class 
publication of the South, and to-day there is hardly any better source 
for learning the feelings, habits, and life of the Old South. At the con- 
clusion of the War he moved from New Orleans to New York, and re- 
commenced the publication of his magazine; his death caused it to be 
discontinued after he had carried it through two or three volumes. 
Of its literary men, the best known is Paul Hamilton Hayne, class of 
1850, a member of the famous Hayne family of the Revolution, and a 
relative of the renowned antagonist of Daniel Webster. After 1865 he 
lived quietly in a retired village in Georgia, until he peacefully passed 
away in 1886. 
William H. Trescot was the salutatorian of the class of 1841. He was 
Assistant Secretary of State during Buchanan’s term, and has held im- 
portant foreign appointments since then. He is now one of the best 
authorities on international law and diplomacy in the United States. 
Many others attended its classes without graduating, among whom 
may be mentioned the scholarly Hugh S. Legaré, and the talented 
William Lowndes. 
PRESENT CONDITION OF THE COLLEGE. 
The disastrous earthquake of 1886 interrupted the smooth flow of 
duties in the college, as well as elsewhere in the city. But the dam- 
ages have been repaired and the work now goes forward as usual. 
Some extracts from a recent letter of the president will give an idea of 
the present circumstances : 
“As you probably have sufficient material for the brief historical 
outline which your space permits, I shall endeavor to add a few details 
respecting the scholastic, or academic, phases of the institution. * * * 
The College of Charleston is the oldest institution in the State de- 
voted to the advancement of higher education, having celebrated its 
one-hundredth anniversary in 1885. In mere numerical strength it 
has never ranked among the leading institutions of the South, its high- 
est attendance not having exceeded seventy in the collegiate depart-

ment. The preparatory, or grammar, school was dispensed with about 
fifty years ago. The college has educated a very large proportion of 
the most eminent citizens of Charleston; indeed, many who have 
achieved fame in other sections of our country and in every sphere of 
professional life. It maintains almost unmodified the strict collegiate 
curriculum—languages, ancient and modern, mathematics, and the 
sciences. The elective system, which in its extreme form has been en- 
grafted upon so many of our.colleges and nominal universities, has not 
been adopted, nor is there any movement in that direction. * * * 
The faculty have done much excellent work in science and literature, 
probably more than has been accomplished in any southern college or 
institution, except the University of Virginia.” 
Thé entrance examinations require, in Greek, two books of the Anab- 
asis; in Latin, four orations of Cicero and two books of the Aneid; 
some knowledge of ancient and modern geography, the history of the 
United States, French, and German. The course covers four years, 
with no electives allowed. The work in English is hardly surpassed 
by that of any college in the country. 
SOUTH CAROLINA MILITARY ACADEMY. 
- The South Carolina College had been organized chiefly on the classi- 
cal basis, and most of the other schools in the State followed the same 
course very rigidly. Electives were unknown in those colleges. There 
was a feeling that the course in those institutions was too narrow and 
unpractical; that there was need of some other training than for the 
bar, the pulpit, and public life. It was the first indefinite longing for 
what the State still partly needs—technical industrial training. The 
aim was to avoid the classics altogether, but not to be so entirely tech- 
nical as West Point, while still taking that institution as a model. 
The people felt it best to maintain a nucleus of military organization 
“for the State’s physical protection, in case of a possible insurrection,” 
and for this purpose there were military establishments at Charleston 
and Columbia. The State kept military stores and munitions of war 
at both places, and appropriated $24,000 annually to maintain a com- 
pany of soldiers at each of them. But Gov. J. P. Richardson in 1841 
suggested that the property of the State could be guarded as well by 
boys as by soldiers, and that they could at the same time be trained into 
capable, worthy citizens. In accordance with this suggestion, Colonel 
Phillips introduced a bill to convert the Arsenal at Columbia and the 
Citadel at Charleston into schools, but his plan provided for a course 
of education but little removed from the free school. In consequence it 
failed. But the Governor on his own authority placed a number of de- 
serving young men under the officers for training and instruction. 
During the summer of 1842, the Governor broached his plan of a 
school to General James Jones; but it was not sufficiently broad and 
 
-P-A-G-E-72
  70 HIGHER EDUCATION IN SOUTH CAROLINA. 
elevated to suit the latter, since it would make “neither soldiers nor 
scholars,” and he wrote to J. H. Hammond, who was a candidate for 
Governor, to oppose the measure. By the time of meeting of the Leg- 
islature in the fall Richardson’s ideas had enlarged, and he strongly 
urged the founding of the schools on such liberal basis as suited Gen- 
eral Jones. General D. F. Jamison introduced a bill for this purpose, 
and it was ake December 20, 1842. The act was very broad in its 
provisions, and left almost the entire scope and plan of the schools to 
the discretion of the board of visitors. This board consisted of five 
members, appointed by the Governor, with the Adjutant and Inspector- 
General members ew officio. Two years after the Governor became a 
member ex officio, making the board of seven members as at present. 
The first members appointed were James Jones, D. F. Jamison, W. J. 
Hanna, Daniel Wallace, and J. H. Means. 
At first the two schools were independent of each other; but on fail- 
ure of attempts to consolidate them in 1845, the Arsenal was made 
auxiliary to the Citadel and the first class was instructed there. The 
course of study covered four years, and was. intended to be mainly math- 
ematical and scientific, with one modern language. Their model was 
West Point, and it has been claimed that the course in mathematics is 
even broader than at that school. The entrance examinations were 
probably not so advanced or so searching, although covering the same 
subjects. Several of the staff in the first years were graduates of that 
institution. The board aimed not to do too much, but to do thoroughly 
what was attempted ; to teach the boys not “ what to think,” but “ how 
to think.” 
A strict and rigid discipline was necessary in order to train the fiery 
youth who were more accustomed to command than to obey. Military 
‘habits of regularity and self-dependence were needed for boys who 
never brushed their shoes or saddled a horse. ‘Wise men saw the 
deficiencies of the youth of South Carolina in the matter referred to, 
and recognized the demand for a school that would apply the remedy 
’ for the existing evil. Such a remedy the military schoois offered.” 
“Parents in South Carolina hailed the establishment of her military 
academies, and so rapidly have they grown in public favor that the 
buildings were doubled in capacity within seven years after their 
founding.”? In the thirteenth year after the founding of the Academy 
twenty-eight pay applications had to be rejected for want of room, and 
the board recommended a third enlargement of the building at the 
Arsenal to accommodate these increasing applications. 
In the organization of the school the merit system was recognized, 
and indigent boys had an opportunity, the first offered by the State 
on any seale, of getting an education free. The South Carolina College 
provided ample facilities for the rich boy, but practically no aid was ex- 
tended to his poorer neighbor. Fifty-four indigent boys were educated.

free of expense at the Academy. They are now chosen by competitive 
examination, a certain number from each district according to its popu- 
lation, and hold the place until graduation, unless they fail to reach a 
certain grade of standing. These beneficiaries are further required to 
teach for two years in the public schools after graduation. | Pay cadets 
were also admitted, subject to the same regulations as the others. 
In another respect the institution has followed West Point—in pro- 
viding officers for the State. Up to the close of the school in 1864 about 
eighteen hundred had entered, and two hundred and forty had gradu- 
ated. Of the graduates, nearly every one entered the army, and four, 
Hagood, Jenkins, Law, and Capers, became brigadier-generals. Jenkins 
fell at the Wilderness. Of the others, ‘‘a number served as colonels, 
lieutenant-colonels, majors, captains, and lieutenants; some were sur- 
geons, some chaplains, two served in the C. 8. Navy, while the remain- 
der represented almost every grade of the service.” Of the graduates, 
nearly twenty per cent. died in service. 
The school continued its. work even during the bombardment of 
Charleston, until December, 1864, when it seemed necessary to order 
the cadets into active service. The first military work of the Academy 
officials had been in drilling the Palmetto regiment. But in 1864 the 
corps was sent to the coast to repel some raiding parties. “Their con- 
duct was such as to excite the commendation of the veteran troops by 
whose side they fought, and to call forth the approval of the command- 
ing general as well as the colonel commanding the expedition.”! They 
were ordered to James’ Island, where they remained until the evacuation 
of Charleston, in February, 1865. They then marched into North Caro- 
lina, and afterward returned to Upper South Carolina at the command 
of the Governor, and were finally disbanded May 9, 1865, “being at that 
time the only body in arms in the State, and perhaps in the South this 
side of the Mississippi River.” During the time of service in the field, 
‘our died from exposure and hardship, and several were severely 
wounded, and others slightly. There were in the battalion two hundred 
and sixty-five cadets at the time of the surrender. 
The studies of the Academies ended in December, 1864, and the schools 
ere formally closed in December, 1865. The Arsenal at Columbia was 
demolished, and the grounds finally sold under the Sinking Fund Com- 
mission. The United States troops took possession of the grounds and 
uildings of the Citadel Academy at Charleston and held them until 
882, when they were voluntarily abandoned and the State again as- 
umed control. The personal property of the Citadel Academy had 
been removed to Columbia and had been lost in the destruction of that 
‘ity. 
The Legislature passed an act for the re-opening of the school, and 
his was done in 1882. There is only one branch now, that at Charles- 
on. A statement of its recent development is given below.

  72 HIGHER EDUCATION IN ‘SOUTH CAROLINA. 
The school has trained men for successful careers in public life and 
in practical pursuits. Among the one hundred and seventy-five gradu- 
ates up to 1860, there were teachers, physicians, lawyers, civil engineers, 
architects, agriculturists, merchants, book-keepers, clergymen, editors, 
city officials, and railroad men. Several of them have also been promi- 
nent in public life. KR. M. Sims (class of 1856) was the first Secretary 
of State after the reconstruction. Johnson Hagood, standing first in 
his class (1847), was Comptroller-General and then Governor of the 
State, 1880-82. Hugh S. Thompson (1856) was a most efficient State 
Superintendent of Education for six years after 1876, and brought order 
out of chaos, afterward Governor two terms, late Assistant Secretary 
of the U.S. Treasury.) Asbury Coward (1854), State Superintendent 
of Education for four years, was also principal of King’s Mountain 
Military School. Ellison Capers (1857), a distinguished officer in the 
Confederate army, now rector of one of the strongest Episcopal churches 
in the State (at Columbia), was elected bishop of one of the dioceses of 
Maryland. W. P. Dubose (1855) is now a professor in the University 
of the South. Dr. Peter Bryce (1857), Superintendent of the Insane 
Hospital of Alabama at Tuscaloosa, was appointed in 1860, and is still 
at thé head of that institution, which ranks second to no similar insti- 
tution in the Union in its equipment and management. 
Among the more distinguished graduates of the Citadel Academy 
may also be mentioned Col. W. E. Stoney, Comptroller-General ; Hon. 
T. G. Dargan, Member of Congress; Right Rev. P. F. Stevens; Col. C. 
C. Tew; Gen. Micah Jenkins; Gen. E. M. Law; Maj. C. 8. Gadsden ;

A STATEMENT OF THE RECENT DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTH CARO- 
LINA MILITARY ACADEMY. 
[This statement was prepared for use in this connection by Maj. Saint 
James Cummings, professor of English Literature and History in the 
South Carolina Military Academy.] 
From the early years of its history to the present time the officers of 
the Citadel Academy have worked zealously for its best development 
along the lines on which it was established. Its record shows no weak- 
ening in this determination. But never has there been a more pro- 
nounced improvement, both in its aims and its work, than during the 
last few years. This is attested in a general way by the hearty, even 
enthusiastic, appreciation of the public that sustains it. Formerly the 
institution had to content itself with the approval and interest of the 
    
' Recently nominated democratic member of the Civil Service Commission. 
   
-P-A-G-E-77

people of South Carolina. It now claims the attention of patrons and 
admirers in a number of other States. But amore pointed proof of the 
new growth of the school lies in its character. It is a unique agent in 
the history of education. A child of West Point, it has improved on 
its birthright; and by the force of the circumstances under which it has 
grown up, it has learned a wise adaptation to the needs of the section 
that has enjoyed its labors. 
Its field of action lies between that of the United States Military 
Academy and that of the various State universities.. It does not intend 
to produce specialists, either as soldiers or as scholars. From a military 
discipline which is firm and vigorous, yet kindly, the student draws a 
training in the habits of mind and body that is desirable even for him 
who is to be a civilian. Accompanying this feature, certain modifica- 
tions and extensions are made in the curriculum, which a purely military 
institution considers of less importance for its needs. These added feat- 
ures have in view the training of the student for the more practical and 
less technical duties of life. The careers of the graduates of the South 
Carolina Military Academy justify the wisdom of the plan of instruction 
in this respect. In all the work of the school a cleanness and thorough- 
ness of performance is demanded. As soon as possible after his admis- 
sion into the school, the close attention and ambitious execution of a 
growing apprentice is enjoined upon the cadet. 
The curriculum embraces courses in moral and political science, 
mathematics and engineering, the physical sciences, history and Eng- 
lish literature, modern languages, drawing and book-keeping, and mili- 
tary science and tactics. 
As an instance of the recent development of the institution may be 
mentioned the establishment of two new chairs of instruction,—that of 
moral and political science, and that of Englisl literature and history. 
Professors have also been elected for these chairs. | Another new feat- 
ure is the election of two assistant instructors for the departments of 
English literature and history, and chemistry and physics, respectively. 
The course of instruction in modern languages has been increased so 
as to include at present both the French and German languages. The 
recent introduction of the German language and literature was made 
in appreciation of the value of a knowledge of this language for general 
scholarship. 
The elevated moral tone of the Academy is most manifest; and it is 
noteworthy in view of the fact that the growth of the religious spirit 
of the corps of cadets is in keeping with the growth of the institution 
in other particulars. There is a quiet earnestness of manly and noble 
purpose, which is felt to be the mark of student life at this place. 
This is in very great part due to the happy influences which have been 
set to work by the present: Superintendent; and it has already estab- 
lished a precedent of high-minded conduct from which it will be the 
ambition of the school never to retrograde.

| 74 HIGHER EDUCATION IN SOUTH CAROLINA, 
Several years ago the State made claims for re-imbursement from the 
General Government for the use and occupation of the Citadel building, 
and for the value of the western wing, that was destroyed by fire dur- 
ing that occupation, Congress, having consolidated these two claims, 
voted to the State the sum of $77,250, as representing what was justly 
due the State from the General Government on that account. The 
General Assembly, at its session of 1888, directed that this amount, less 
twenty thousand dollars, be applied to the rebuilding of the western 
wing of the Citadel building and the better equipment of the school. 
This twenty thousand dollars included five thousand reserved for pay- 
ment of the cost of collection, as well as fifteen thousand dollars ad- 
vanced by the State for the repairing and equipment of the Citadel 
buildings, and for the current expenses for the year following the reor- 
ganization of the Academy in 1882. This work of rebuilding is already 
in progress. : 
Special attention has been given in this Academy to the study of 
mathematics, pure and applied. From the early years of the school’s 
history to the present, this course has been emphasized, and has grown 
in use till, as now taught, it is most thorough and solid. Exceptional 
praise is deserved for the thoroughness of the method of instruction, 
whereby the student realizes, on graduating, a capital of mathematical 
and engineering knowledge ready for use. The experience of the grad- 
uates is that in this field they are rich men, and men whose usefulness 
is put to account. Among the alumni of the Academy are many active 
civil engineers. The department is in charge of a professor whose re- 
pute as a practical engineer and author of standard and specially rec- 
ognized text-books and treatises is a clear indication of his capability 
and zeal as a teacher. t 
A representative judgment of the methods and aims of the depart- 
ment of physical sciences may be made from the fact that among those 
who have assisted in the organization of this department of late years 
are graduates of the University of Virginia, the United States Naval 
Academy, Johns Hopkins University, and the German universities. 
The present incumbent of the chair is a graduate of the University of 
Virginia and Heidelberg University, pursued special studies at Git- 
tingen, and has enjoyed peculiar advantages as an instructor in these 
branches at Johns Hopkins University. 
With the projected improvement of the physical and chemical labo- 
ratories and the purchase of new apparatus, the departments of math- 
ematics and engineering and physical sciences will receive a fresh im- 
petus. 
A blessing that will be felt throughout the school, irrespective of de- 
partments, is the proposed library, for the purchase of which the Board 
of Visitors have reserved a share of the gross amount just granted by 
Congress. 
The latest touchstone of sympathy with advanced educational aims
-P-A-G-E-79
  
SOUTH CAROLINA MILITARY ACADEMY. 15 
is the attitude of an institution toward those studies included under the 
heading of English. The individual importance of, the group of Eng- 
lish studies has failed of proper recognition till late years in almost all 
institutions of learning. It is eminently fitting that a practical school, 
such as the South Carolina Military Academy, should be numbered with 
those which disseminate reforming influences in this matter, and witness 
to the worth of an English education, sound in method and substance. 
The Board of Visitors have shown their spirit in this direction not only 
by the establishment of a separate chair of English studies, but also by 
electing to that chair a gentleman who received special training for this 
work at Johns Hopkins University. And, furthermore, they have mani- 
fested a special desire that this department be made prominent in the 
scheme of studies. It is gratifying to note this abiding interest in the 
humanities in a city that has sent forth so many famous masters of 
thought. 
The following is the present Board of Visitors:

Upheld by the people, extending its clientage from this to neighbor-

the larger hopes that are now resting upon it.

THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS OF CHARLESTON.' 
The public schools of Charleston are the Bennett, Crafts, Memminger, 
Meeting Street, Mary’s Street, Shaw, and Courtenay Schools, several 
of which have been named after distinguished citizens who have taken 
an active and generous interest in the system. This is notably the case 
with those named after Gov. John S. Bennett, Hon. William Crafts, 
Hon. ©. G. Memminger, and Hon. William A. Courtenay. 
In token of their high appreciation of the services of Mr. Memminger, 
a marble bust by the eminent Virginia sculptor, E. V. Valentine, which 
was executed by authority of the General Assembly of the State, very 
handsomely mounted on a base of elaborate workmanship, has been 
erected in the Council Chamber opposite the panel on the west of the 
mayor’s desk occupied by the bust of Mr. Petigru. There, in the recog- 
nized public hall of the city, where they can be seen by coming genera- 
tions, in the same apartment with the historic portraits of Washington, 
Monroe, Jackson, Calhoun, Moultrie, Marion, and others, are displayed 
the marble busts of Fulton, Hayne, Petigru, Courtenay, and Memminger. 
The ceremony of unveiling this bust took place in the Council Cham- 
ber on the 29th of February, 1888. The Hon. Charles Simonton, judge 
of the United States court and chairman of the Board of School Com- 
missioners, presided, and in felicitous language placed the memcrial in 
the keeping of the city authorities. 
The following is the inscription on the pedestal: 
Christopher Gustavus Memminger, founder of the present public school system in 
Charleston, The City Board of School Commissioners, with the approval of the Leg- 
islature of South Carolina, erect this memorial in grateful appreciation of his services 
for thirty-three years. 
“Heaven doth with us as we with torches do, 
Not light them for themselves ; for if our virtues 
Did not go forth of us, ’t were all alike 
As if we had them not.” 
1887. 
No city in the Union at the present time has a better system of schools 
than the city of Charleston. In separate schools for each race, facilities 
are afforded for educating the children in the ordinary branches of a 
common school education. 
THE PRESENT CONDITION OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 
The five teachers of 1811 had grown to ninety-one in 1887, the five 
thousand one hundred dollars of school funds to sixty-two thousand 
dollars; but the increase in population, and the necessity of providing 
for the large number of colored children, under the changed relations

  THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS OF CHARLESTON. : TT 
of that class, have brought about a condition of affairs which is press- 
ing at all points for solution. 
The facts of this problem, which must be looked full in the face, are 
as follows: Before the recent Civil War all the school-houses of the 
city were under the charge of the school board, including the Friend 
Street School, now burned, and were occupied by white children, Since 
the War the Morris Street School, which is the largest and best, has 
been given to the colored children. The Shaw Memorial School has 
been similarly occupied, and the Friend Street school-house was des- 
troyed in the fire of 1861. The result is, that while facilities for the 
colored children have been largely provided, those for white children 
have been diminished one-half. The number of children (whites) in 
the public schools in 1860 was about four thousand; the number of 
children, white and colored, in the public schools in 1887 was 4,192, the 
whites numbering 2,065 and the colored 2,127.! The present school 
room is overcrowded with this number. The population in 1887 was 
larger than in 1860, the whites and blacks being nearly equal. It will 
be seen, therefore, that by the addition of colored children the number 
of children has been doubled. The number of white and colored in 
attendance in 1887 is about the same as the whites alone in 1860, or, in 
other words, on the basis of the average percentage of school attend- 
ance reached in 1860, about one-half of the white children and one- 
half of the colored children of the city are to-day without the means 
of public instruction. The statement of these facts reveals the educa- 
tional situation in that city, a perilous situation to the community, more 
or less common to the whole State and to the South. 
To meet this emergency and to sustain the present school system, 
Charleston is doing more than she ever did before, and more in com- 
parison than any other city in the Union. 
The facts are these: The assessed values of the city of Charleston in 
1860 were forty-five millions, and in 1886, twenty-one millions, a reduc- 
tion of more than one-half of taxable values, in the face of the obliga- 
tion to educate more than double the number of children. 
This heavy load has been assumed up to the highest pitch of taxation, 
however, as the facts show. The taxation of the city of Charleston in 
1886 for public schools was three and one-half mills, amounting to about 
sixty-one thousand dollars a year, and this is exclusive of annual ap- 
propriations to the high school of Charleston, and to the Charleston 
College. How much above a maximum this taxation is, and what a 
burden it is, is evident by comparison. For instance, compare this 
taxation with that of the city of Boston, whose schools are models, and

schools in the city is as follows: The Porter Academy,. 148; the Roman Catholic 
schools, 600; the Wallingford Academy, colored, 667; the Everret Normal Institute, 
177; and the High School of Charleston, 163,

cational institutions, and we find that the city of Boston gave a total of 
two and one-half mills in 1880 for a complete school establishment of 
seven high schools, two Latin schools, one normal school, forty-nine 
grammar schools, and four hundred and eight primary schools. The 
city of Charleston gives in proportion nearly half as much again as 
Boston for her primary schools alone, and makes in addition annual 
appropriations to the high school and to the Charleston College. It 
must be remembered, also, that this is done under a very heavy debt to 
the State, the interest of which requires ten mills of actual taxation. 
Again, beside the State tax, the total tax of Charleston is two and 
one-fourth per cent., while in Boston it is only one and one-fourth per 
cent. 
When it is remembered through what vicissitudes of fortune and 
trouble this city has passed since 1865, it will be at once seen that it is 
doing its full duty in respect to the education of its children. 
It appears, too, that with this taxation at its highest pitch for publie 
schools, a greater burden than any other city bears, the city of Charles- 
ton can not grapple with this educational question, that she can not 
educate her children, that she only educates one-half of them in the 
public schools. There is no school—there are no teachers—for nearly 
one-half that now go untaught. This statement, when made for the 
city of Charleston, is also made for other communities of the State, and 
the whole South. 
The city of Charleston, with the South, faces this question with a full 
responsibility to speak and act. It is fraught with the gravest issues. 
This is a question for all southern communities, who were left utterly 
bankrupt, with a whole race made citizens who had to be educated up 
to the knowledge and responsibilities of citizenship, who to-day have 
made very little progress, comparatively, in knowledge, and who pay 
hardly three per cent. of the taxes. 
A statement of these propositions, it seems, is all that is necessary 
to show that the South needs the help of the National Government to 
educate this generation; help of the same kind, and help on the same 
principle, as that which now supports the State agricultural colleges, 
which could not now be carried on without the revenue from public 
lands given by Congress to the States for this purpose. 
The Fathers of the Republic realized that the only hope of the per- 
manency of free institutions rested on the virtue and intelligence of 
those clothed with the elective franchise. Their words are admonitions 
of wider meaning to-day, when we behold the tide of immigration 
bringing to our shores the population of Europe, and especially when, 
within little more than a decade, five millions of people of African de- 
scent have been emancipated. The relation of this population to the 
people and Government of the United States has its obligations and 
duties. Historically considered, it is an unquestionable fact that they 
were introduced into what is now the territory of the United States as

slaves, and slavery continued by authority of the British Government 
one hundred years before the Declaration of Independence. Nor was 
it done with the sanction of the colonial Legislatures, some, if not all of 
which, earnestly remonstrated. 
When our fathers undertook to form the Constitution of the United 
States, they left slavery as they found it. At the close of the Revolu- 
tionary War slavery existed in all of the colonies, but under legislation 
it was confined to the Southern States, and, by amendment to the Con- 
stitution, finally ceased to exist anywhere within the jurisdiction of the 
Government; and five millions of people, suddenly, without prepara- 
tion, were raised from slavery to the high position of citizenship in a 
great republic with all its rights and responsibilities. The Rev. Barnas 
Sears, D. D., agent of the Peabody Fund, himself a New Englander, 
whose duties for twelve years carried him into all portions of the 
Southern States, and into personal contact with all classes of the colored 
race, states in his last report, “ that the larger portion of them are con- 
‘fessedly unqualified for a judicious exercise of the suffrage.” No un- 
prejudiced or well-informed man can question the truth of this state- 
ment. This large class of more than half a million of uneducated voters 
are not merely citizens and voters in the States in which they reside, 
but they are also citizens of the United States. The power they wield 
and the influence they exert are not merely local, but they are coexten- 
sive with the Union. Their votes may decide questions of peace or war, 
they may control presidential elections, and give shape to the politics 
of the nation. They themselves are eligible to office, and legally com- 
petent to sit as judges and jurors in cases of life, liberty, and property. 
The evils likely to ensue from intrusting political power to ignorant 
and incompetent hands, needs at this day no further exposition. In 
the words of Madison: “A popular government without popular edu- 
cation, or the means of acquiring it, is but a prologue to a farce or a 
tragedy, or perhaps both.” 
The best security to guard against the evils that threaten us is in 
affording to ignorant voters such a degree of education as will qualify 
them for the duties of citizenship.’ Popular education is a duty which, 
as a general rule, belongs to the Government and the people of the re-~ 
spective States. It is a matter of local and domestic policy, which can 
be properly and effectually managed by the local governments. But 
the colored race constitute an exceptional class of our population. They 
had no opportunity of obtaining education and acquiring property. 
They are not responsible for their ignorance ; they have had no teachers, 
and their parents were as ignorant as themselves. Justice to them 
requires that they should be given that education which alone can make 
them responsible citizens in their duties to others, and in protecting 
themselves and their own rights. 
Again, so large an element of ignorance infused into our body politic 
must be a source of weakness to our system of government, The neces- 
 
-P-A-G-E-84

sity of education, the peril of delay, the magnitude of the danger, are 
all evident. The Southern States have not been insensible to the mis- 
chief of so large a class of ignorant voters, and they have manifested 
the most praiseworthy disposition to aid, as far as their means would 
allow, in their education. In most, if not all of them, systems of free 
schools have been established, in which the white and colored children 
receive the same advantages; but in their impoverished condition they 
are unable adequately to meet the emergency. It may be asked if 
Congress has not the constitutional power to help the education of the 
South in this emergency, if it has not the power to contribute to the 
education of the citizens of the States. 
This question isnotanewone. The laws of the United States present 
innumerable precedents in which Congress has exercised power to con- 
tribute toward the general education of citizens of new States. This 
aid has been extended by granting public lands for the purpose. The 
public domain of the United States is made up of the vast North-West- 
ern Territory ceded by the States to the General Government in 1783 
for the use and benefit of all the States, lands acquired by the purchase 
of Louisiana in 1803, the purchase of Florida in 1819, the acquisitions 
from Mexico, the territory obtained by treaty with Indian tribes, and 
by the purchase of Alaska. 
In May, 1785, the Contineutal Congress enacted that the lands ceded 
by the old thirteen States should be laid off in townships, and that sec- 
tion 16 in each township should be reserved for the maintenance of the 
public schools, and that two townships in every State should be set 
apart for the support of a university. 
In 1848-49 a more liberal policy was adopted for the new States. 
Two sections were set apart for school purposes in each township, and 
in every State admitted since 1848 the 16th and 36th sections of each 
township, one-eighteenth of the entire area, have been granted to the 
common schools, In view of this unbroken line of precedents, it seems 
idle now to raise a question as to the constitutional power of Congress 
to make such grants. 
. THE ORPHAN HOUSE OF CHARLESTON. 
One of the distinguishing features of the city government of Charles- 
ton, which is worthy of more than passing remark, is the admirable 
voluntary management of the several public institutions of charity by 
boards of commissioners representing all professions and classes of 
citizens. A vast amount of unremunerated work is done in these pub- 
lic trusts, with intelligence, energy, and economy, by public spirited 
corporators, who recognize and act upon the fact that society must 
necessarily have offices of beneficence, which should be administered 
by citizens having the advantage of professional and business knowl- 
edge, who act upon the theory that there are duties in life to be dis- 
charged on a high plane, purifying the public mind and ennobling the 
public spirit. 
 
-P-A-G-E-85
    THE ORPHAN HOUSE OF CHARLESTON. 81 
The care of orphans, the relief of the poor, the administration of 
hospitals, as well as the elevation of educational institutions, afford 
honorable though gratuitous service to quite a number of citizens. 
These positions of beneficent activities are regarded as privileged ones, 
and all vacancies are quickly filled, and many who have performed 
these offices have been men of distinction and high character. Those 
who have held the position of chairman of the Commissioners of the 
Orphan House are Arnoldus Vanderhorst, John Huger, Charles Lin- 
ning, Rawlins Lowndes, John B. Holmes, Henry W. De Saussure, 
Daniel Stephens, John Dawson, Thomas Lee, Thomas Roper, James 
Jervey, Henry A. De Saussure, William C. Bee, and Louis D. Mowry. 
These gentlemen gave their best thought and work for years, gratui- 
tously, to the management of the Orphan House. The example of such 
high citizenship survives the grave, and will ever be a potent influence 
for good to those who serve in similar public trusts. 
Under the act of the Legislature of 1783, incorporating the city of 
Charleston, the care of providing for the poor, and educating and 
maintaining poor orphan children, was devolved upon the City Council. 
In 1790 the City Council passed an ordinance for “the establishing of 
an orphan house at Charleston, for the purpose of supporting and 
educating orphan children, and those of poor, distressed, or disabled 
parents who are unable to support and maintain them.” Under this 
ordinance the corner-stone was laid by John Huger, intendant of 
Charleston, on the 12th of November, 1792, and the building having 
been completed, the commissioners on the 18th of October, 1794, in- 
troduced into the institution one hundred and fifteen children, the ob- 
jects of charity. The number of orphan children who have been re- 
ceived into the institution, nurtured, and educated since its origin is 
over four thousand. The number at any time has never been less than 
one hundred and two, and the greatest number was three hundred and. 
fifty. The present number is over two hundred and twenty. The in- 
stitution is governed by a Board of twelve commissioners, elected an- 
nually by the City Council. They meet weekly. One of their number 
is charged each week in rotation with the special supervision of the 
house. The officers of the house consist of a principal, who has the 
general supervision of all the departments, seven teachers, and four 
assistant matrons. 
Connected with the institution is an excellent school, in which 
reading, writing, orthography, mental and written arithmetic, primary 
geography, advanced geography, history—ancient and modern, gram- 
mar, familiar science, physical geography, and vocal and instrumental 
music are taught, while the kindergarten numbers seventy-three pupils 
in charge of two teachers. 
A chapel is attached to the institution, in which religious services 
are held every Sunday afternoon by the Protestant clergy of the city, 
officiating in rotation. A Sunday-school is conducted every Sunday

morning from nine to ten o’clock, under the charge of a superintendent 
and seventeen teachers, some of whom are residents of the institution, 
and the remainder volunteers from the various Christian congregations 
of the city. ‘ 
The children are apprenticed to various trades and occupations. 
Many boys from this institution have been an honor and an ornament 
to it. Several have taken high rank in the Navy, at the bar, in the 
Legislature, in the pulpit, and in other walks of life. 
In the more retired sphere of womanhood, many of the girls have 
become model wives and mothers, and have transmitted to their chil- 
dren the fruits of a moral and religious training imparted to them in 
this institution. ; 
The annual cost of maintaining the institution is about twenty thou- 
sand dollars. By section 15 of an act of the Legislature of December 
21, 1799, it is enacted that all property in the two parishes of St. Philip 
and St. Michael, then escheated or thereafter to be escheated to the 
State, not exceeding fifty thousand dollars, should be vested in the City 
Council of Charleston for the benefit of the Orphan House of Charles- 
ton. Under the provisions of this act the total sum authorized has 
been acquired, and has been invested from time to time in bank stock 
and other securities, and is held in the assets of the Orphan House 
fund. Since 1796 various legacies and donations have been received, 
which, with the proceeds of the escheated property, form a fund in 
the hands of the trustees, which on January 1, 1881, was one hundred 
and eighty thousand dollars. 
Connected with the institution is a library of science and general 
literature numbering over three thousand volumes. 
For this sketch we are indebted to the reports of the Hon. William 
A. Courtenay, late mayor of the city of Charleston. 
THE CHARLESTON EARTHQUAKE. 
When the bells of St. Michael’s Church in Charleston chiined the third 
quarter after nine o’clock on the evening of Tuesday, August 31, 1886, 
their familiar tones spoke peace alone to the many happy homes on every 
side, within whose sheltering walls the people of a fair and prosperous 
city had gathered torest. There was no whispered warning in the well- 
known sounds, or in any subdued voice of the night, to hint of the fearful 
calamity sonearathand. Not the unconscious bells themselves were less 
suspicious of coming ill than were those whom their still, solemn tones 
summoned, as at other times, to seek forgetfulness in sleep. The streets 
of the city were silent and nearly deserted. Overhead the stars twinkled 
with unwonted brilliancy in a moonless, unclouded sky. The waters of 
the wide harbor were unruffled by even a passing breeze. Around the 
horizon the dark woodlands hung like purple curtains, shutting out the 
world beyond, as though they guarded the ancient city within their 
charmed circle. Earth and sea alike seemed wrapped with the spell of 
 
-P-A-G-E-87
  THE CHARLESTON EARTHQUAKE. 83 
hushed repose, that reflected as in a mirror the quiet of the biue, eternal 
heavens bending over them. 
It was upon such a scene of calm and silence that the shock of the 
great earthquake fell with the suddenness of a thunderbolt, launched 
from the starlit skies with the might of ten thousand thunderbolts fall- 
ing together, with a force so far surpassing all other forces known to 
man that no similitude can be found for it. The firm foundation upon 
which every home had been built, in unquestioning faith in its stability, 
was giving away; the barriers of the great deep were breaking up. To 
the ignorant mind, it seemed in truth that God had laid his hand in 
anger upon his creation. The great and the wise, knowing little more, 
fearing little less, than the humblest of their wretched fellow-creatures, 
bowed themselves in awe as before the face of the destroying angel. 
For a few moments all the inhabitants of the city stood together in the 
presence of death in its most terrible form, and perhaps scarcely one 
doubted that all would be swallowed up together in one wide, yawning 
grave. 
The picture is not overdrawn. The heart and the hand shrink from 
the task of trying to depict faithfully, in any terms, the scene and 
emotions of that dreadful hour. The transition from a long-established’ 
condition of safety and peacefulness to one of profound and general 
danger and terror, was absolute and instantaneous. Within seven min- 
utes after the last stroke of the chime, and while its echoes seemed yet 
to mingle in listening ears, the city was in ruins, and the wreck had 
been accomplished in one of the last minutes of the seven. Millions of 
dollars’ worth of property, the accumulation of nearly two centuries, had 
been destroyed in the time a child would take to crush a frail toy. Every 
home in the city had been broken or shattered, and beneath the ruins 
lay the lifeless or bruised and bleeding bodies of men, women, and 
children who had been stricken down in the midst of such security as 
he enjoys who reads these lines at any remote distance of time or space. 
The attention of the people was first attracted by sounds that seemed 
to come from below, and for a moment were supposed to be caused by 
the rapid rolling of a heavy body, as a heavy safe or heavily laden 
truck, over the floor. This sound was accompanied by a perceptible 
tremor of the earth, not more marked, however, than would be caused 
by the passage of a car or dray on the street. 
For two or three seconds the occurrence excited no surprise or com- 
ment. Then all at once the sound deepened in volume, the tremor be- 
came very decided, the ear caught the rattle of window sashes, gas 
fixtures, and other movable objects; men glanced hurriedly at each 
other, and springing to their feet with the startled question and answer, 
“What is that?” ‘An earthquake!”—then all was bewilderment and 
confusion. The long roll deepened and spread into a wild roar that 
seemed to pervade at once the earth and the air above and around. 
The tremor was now a rude, rapid quiver that agitated the lofty, strong,
-P-A-G-E-88
  84 HIGHER EDUCATION IN SOUTH CAROLINA. 
solid buildings as though they were being shaken by the hand of an 
immeasurable power, with intent to tear their joints asunder and scatter 
their foundations abroad, as a tree casts its over-ripened fruit before 
the breath of the gale. 
There was no intermission of the vibration of the mighty subterranean 
engine; from the first to the last it was a continuous jar, adding force 
with every moment, and as it approached and reached the climax of its 
manifestation it seemed for a few terrible seconds as if no work of man’s 
hands could survive the shocks. Floors were heaving under the 
surrounding walls, partitions visibly swayed to and fro, the crash of 
falling masses of stone and brick and mortar was heard overhead, and. 
without, the terrible roar filled the ears and seemed to fill the mind and 
heart, and for a few panting breaths, or while you held your breath in 
anticipation of immediate and cruel death, you felt that life was already 
past, and waited for the end, as the victim with his head on the block 
awaits the fall of the axe. 
For a second or two it seemed that the worst had passed and that the 
violent motion had subsided. It increased again, and became as severe 
as before, and none expected to escape. A sudden rush was made to 
endeavor to reach the open air and fly to a place of safety ; but before 
the doors were reached all stopped short as by a common impulse, feel- 
ing that hope was vain, that it was only a question of death within the 
buildings or without, of being buried beneath the sinking roofs or by 
the falling walls. 
The uproar slowly died away in seeming distance, the earth was still, 
and oh, the blessed relief of that stillness! But how rudely the silence 
was broken. From every quarter arose the cries of pain and fear, the 
prayers and wailings of terrified women and children, mingled with the 
hoarse shouts of excited men. The air was filled with a whitish cloud 
of dry, stifling dust, arising from the lime and mortar of the shattered 
buildings, which, falling upon the pavements, had been reduced to pow- 
der. Through this cloud, dense as a fog, the gas jets flickered feebly, 
shedding but little light. On every side were hurrying forms of men 
and women, bareheaded, partially dressed, some almost nude, and all 
nearly crazed with fear and excitement. All around were seen the 
wounded and the terrified—men in their shirt-sleeves with blood stream- 
ing over their clothes, and some prone and motionless on the pavement, 
with upturned faces and outstretched limbs, and the crowd which was 
now gathered in the street passing by, none pausing to see whether they 
were alive or dead. A sudden light flares through a window into the 
street; it becomes momentarily brighter, and the ery of ‘‘fire” resounds. 
A rush is made toward the spot; a man is seen lying doubled up, si- 
lent and lifeless, against the wall, but at this moment, somewhere—at 
sea—overhead—deep in the ground—is heard again the low, ominous 
roll, already too well known to be mistaken. It grows louder, nearer, 
like the growl of a wild beast swiftly approaching its prey, and all is
-P-A-G-E-89
  
} 
THE CHARLESTON EARTHQUAKE. 85 
forgotten in the rush for the open space where alone there is hope and 
security. The tall buildings on either hand blot out the skies and the 
stars, and the shattered cornices and copings, the tops of the frowning 
walls, lie piled from both sides to the centre of the streets. It seemed 
that a touch now would send the broken masses left standing, down 
upon the people below, who look up to them and shrink together as the 
tremor of the earthquake passes under them, and the mysterious rever- 
berations swell and roll along like some drum-beat, summoning them to 
dic. It passes away, and once more is experienced the blessed feelin 
of delivery from impending calamity, which, it may well be believed, 
invokes a feeling of thanksgiving and prayer from every heart in the 
throng. 
Tbe first shock occurred at about nine minutes to ten, as was indi- 
eated by the public clocks, the hands of all of which stopped at that 
fateful point, as if to mark the end of time for so many who had counted 
the recurring strokes of the preceding hour without a thought but of 
a happy life. The second shock, which was but a brief echo of the 
first, occurred eight minutes later. 
The general aspect of the city is not a subject of detailed description, 
and can be more readily conceived than put in words. It is enough to 
say that not more than half a dozen houses escaped injury, and that the 
damage to all would be represented by the demolition of one-quarter of 
the buildings on Charleston Neck, by the levelling of all the houses 
south of Broad Street, or by the destruction of a city larger than Co- 
lumbia. The records of the City Assessor’s office show that the dam- 
ages caused by the earthquake were officially estimated during the fol- 
lowing week at about five million dollars. The United States Engineer 
Commission, appointed to determine the condition of the houses, exam- 
ined about two thousand buildings. In their report they say: “We 
estimate approximately that the buildings upon which we have ren- 
dered reports can not be thoroughly repaired for less than two millions, 
and the remaining buildings, while of slight consequence to their own- 
ers, occupants, and the public, will swell the money value of real estate 
damages to a total of from five to six millions.” A board of inspectors, 
consisting of an architect and builder, appointed by the insurance com- 
panies to investigate the condition of the houses, reported that they 
had inspected 6,956 buildings, that ninety per cent. of the brick buildings 
were injured, more or less, that the frame buildings suffered from fall- 
ing chimneys, that not less than fourteen thousand chimneys were in- 
jured, and that ninety-five per cent. of these fourteen thousand were 
broken off at the roof and went to the ground. 
The churches, public buildings, and school-houses shared in this great 
catastrophe, and were all injured. Without exception, the public 
schools suffered much damage. For the repair of these buildings the 
trustees of the Peabody Fund voted four thousand dollars, and contrib- 
utors in Boston and elsewhere contributed twenty thousand dollars for 
     
-P-A-G-E-90
    86 HIGHER EDUCATION IN SOUTH CAROLINA, 
the repair of school-houses. The Porter Academy, the Wallingford 
School, the High School, and the Charleston College were all seriously 
injured. The east and west wings of the Charleston College were so 
much damaged, and the foundations were so defective, that it was 
necessary to have them taken down entirely. The main building and 
portico of the college and the library buildings were also injured, while 
the Citadel building had its towers and parapets thrown down, derang- 
ing the roof, cracking and bulging the walls of the east wing, and 
throwing down all of the overhead plastering, with other injuries. The 
building was left in a condition unsafe for occupancy. 
To aid in rebuilding the ruined city, and for the relief of the citizens, 
generous assistance was contributed from every quarter of the country, 
amounting to the sum of $640,196.91, which was expended under the 
direction of the City Council, while other large sums were specially 
contributed to the sufferers. 
The amount expended for repairs rendered necessary by the earth- 
quake was over four millions of dollars, while the amount expended on 
public buildings, churches, schools, and other property exempted from 
taxation was three hundred thousand dollars. Nor does this statement 
include the amount expended for repairs rendered necessary by the 
disastrous cyclone of August, 1885, which was estimated to be at least 
one million dollars. 
This description of the earthquake has been collated from the narra- 
tive prepared by Mr. Carl McKinley, and published in the Charleston 
Year Book of 1886. 
THE RECONSTRUCTION FOLLOWING THE EARTHQUAKE. 
The reconstruction that has followed the destruction of the earth- 
quake of 1886 is a wonderful and gratifying achievement. The sons of 
the old historic city have manifested a fortitude under the sharp ad- 
versities of fortune that wrecked their homes, that is in keeping with 
their past history. They have overcome and survived the ravages 
of fire, pestilence, and war, the terrors of the tempest, the despair 
and gloom of the earthquake. In their renewed industries and com- 
merce, their rebuilt churches and public and private edifices, the reor- 
ganization of their charities and institutions of education and learning, 
they have resumed their place in the race of civilization, progress, and 
enterprise, and are again on an assured basis of success. In their 
labor and travail they have been fortunate in having the assistance and 
direction of two strong men, whose strength in season and out of sea- 
son did not fail them in the day of adversity, and who have lived to 
enjoy the fruition of their labors in the remarkable resurrection of their 
loved city from its ashes. William A. Courtenay and Francis W. Daw- 
son are the honored names to whom may be awarded a large share of 
the honor and praise for this grand consummation.

CHAPTER V. 
DENOMINATIONAL EDUCATION. 
The chief motive in founding denominational institutions is to pro- 
vide education under Christian influences for youth at the formative 
period of their lives; and further, they are often the outgrowth of 
theological seminaries, and sometimes absorb them in the process of 
evolution. There seems to be an inevitable antagonism to State insti- 
tutions in the minds of many sectarians, who think that the tone and 
surroundings of the State institutions all tend away from a Christian 
life. But the formation of Young Men’s Christian Associations at State 
universities, and their activity in religious work, would seem to indi- 
cate that such institutions are certainly not without Christian influ- 
ences. Indeed, there is a generous rivalry between two State universi- 
ties, those of Michigan and Virginia, as to which shall belong the honor 
of having organized the first collegiate Young Men’s Christian Asso- 
ciation in the United States. 
In the State schools, and in the wealthy colleges of the East, two tend- 
encies are plainly visible. The former aim at simplicity and democracy 
in education; the latter at class distinctions and aristocracy. The 
former tend to make no distinctions among the students, have no honor 
system, and strive all the time to lower tuition and reduce the expenses 
of living. The two leading State schools have no distinctions in grad- 
uation; they all graduate alike, and none can say that he got a higher 
mark than the other. The heavily-endowed institutions of the Mast 
make tuition and living expenses keep pace with the increase of en- 
dowments, and have a regular system of fellowships, scholarships, and. 
grades of diplomas. Both seem to be the natural outgrowth of their 
conditions; the State schools are directly the product of a democracy, 
and must be democratic; the others are created and maintained by 
the wealthy, and are forced to rear classes. In considering the honor 
question, it must be remembered that it is our highest duty to repair the 
inequalities of nature, not sharpen and increase them. The weak and 
helpless should be raised nearer the strong and active, and not be taxed 
to lift the superior classes still higher. In some colleges the tuition for 
all could be reduced over one-half by the abolition of the fellowships 
and scholarships. The gifted can always be relied on to take care of 
themselves, and society, if taxed for the benefit of any, should be taxed, 
87

not to heap honors and emoluments on those already far in advance, 
_ but to assist their less gifted brothers. 
In South Carolina the sectarian colleges unfortunately can become 
schools of only moderate strength. The endowments they had raised 
before the War were all swept away. Yet it has been urged that the 
State university should not come into competition with the denomina- 
tional colleges, but that, if the number of its courses and departments 
of study were increased and its requirements advanced, it would be- 
come the “‘roof and crown” of the general plan of higher education in 
the State. 
In South Carolina, besides the general reason for the establishment 
of these schools, there was a special one,—the attempt to counteract the 
influence of Thomas Cooper. To his teachings and his denunciations 
of Christianity may be directly traced the foundation of one or two sec- 
tarian schools. There was the strongest opposition by the friends of 
the State college, and some went so far as to say that there had better 
be no education at allunlessit was given by the State. But after pain- 
ful effort the measure for the establishment of a sectarian school was 
passed, and others followed in quick succession, until now there are 
tive for the education of white youth. For want of space the history of 
each is only slightly sketched. 
ERSKINE COLLEGE. 
The first denominational college established in the State was due to 
the zealous efforts of the Associate Reformed Presbyterians. It was a 
settled rule with them to allow no one to preach until he had been 
through a classical course, and had studied theology under a compe- 
tent instructor for several years. To furnish the facilities for these 
high requirements, it was felt as a duty, at the earliest, to provide in- 
struction for the ministerial candidates. Classical preparatory schools 
were in consequence established at an early date by members of this 
Church. In the first years of this century Rev. James Rogers opened 
a classical school at Monticello, in Fairfield County, which was largely 
patronized by the people of this denomination. In 1825 a petition had 
been sent up to the Synod praying that the Ebenezer Academy, in York 
County, be taken under the patronage of the Synod. This was done, 
and both of these institutions became widely known and were largely 
patronized by people of the adjoining States. 
To meet the demands for ministerial training, the Synod adopted a 
very remarkable and cheap way of providing the proper facilities; 
they simply passed a resolution establishing a theological school, with 
Rev. John Hemphill and Rev. John T. Pressly as professors, with no 
expense for buildings of any sort, no appropriation for books, and no 
provision for professors’ salaries; indeed, there was to be no salary. 
To add to the extraordinary features of the case, the two professors were 
about one hundred miles apart, and the students would manifestly be

put to some inconvenience to recite to both on the same day, even with 
the rapid transit of the present. Considering the practical difficulties of 
this ideal scheme for a theological seminary, we might agree with the 
painstaking Church historian, that ‘In the providence of God this ar- 
rangement was of short duration.”! 
CLARK AND ERSKINE SEMINARY. 
It was, however, very strongly felt that the welfare of the Church 
demanded training schools for their youth, and in 1834 the Synod, in 
session at Due West Corner, in Abbeville County, passed a series of 
resolutions on the subject of founding a school. They first demanded 
a school with the “manual labor” feature attached to it, and instructed 
the clerk to gather the necessary information in regard to such schools 
in the North. The members of the Synod were also authorized to take 
the sense of their respective congregations. At the meeting of the 
Synod the following year it was found that so few congregations fa- 
vored the “manual labor” plan that it was abandoned. 
But the necessary steps were taken for the establishment of a minis- 
terial school at Due West, in Abbeville County. Agents were sent 
out to solicit subscriptions, and were very successful in raising $7,035, 
a sum sufficient to start the enterprise, though of course it would be 
small now for such a purpose. A suitable building was erected and 
furnished, and the school was opened with about twenty classical stu- 
dents in 1836, while the act of incorporation was secured the following 
year. The aim was to establish an academy for training young men to 
enter the Junior class of any respectable college; but the outcome of 
it all was an institution of higher grade; Mr. John S. Pressly was 
elected principal of the school, and managed it with such success that 
the Synod was induced to widen the original institution into a college. 
In 1839 the committee appointed to consider the matter recommended 
an extension of the course. There was urgent need for a suitable 
building, and the ministers were instructed to solicit funds for this pur- 
pose. The name was changed to Erskine College, and a charter applied 
for from the Legislature. So strong was the affection for the State col- 
lege at Columbia, and so serious were the fears that it might be weak- 
ened by the establishment of other colleges, that the charter was at first 
refused, and was finally obtained, only after active efforts, in 1850.” 
ORGANIZATION OF ERSKINE COLLEGE. 
The institution thus organized in 1839 commenced its work with a 
faculty consisting of Rev. B. E. Pressly, D. D., as president, and three 
professors, N. M. Gordon, Rev. J. N. Young, and Rev. J. P. Pressly, 
D.D. The school was the work of the Church, and was actively sup-

ported by it. Attention was called in the Synod to the fact that there 
was no suitable building for the use of the classes, and it was recom- 
mended that each minister act as agentin his congregation to raise and 
forward the funds for the erection of a building to cost not more than 
five thousand dollars. Within a few years after, in 1843, the board 
of directors reported: ‘The college building is now complete, and the 
entire cost thereof has been met by the treasurer of the building com- 
mittee and of the literary and theological funds.” 
Clark and Erskine Seminary had been established solely for the pur- 
pose of providing ministerial instruction, but out of it had grown the 
literary institution. It went through the same phases of evolution as 
many other denominational colleges. The course of study comprised 
about the same branches, and led to the same degrees, as the other de- 
nominational schools in the State. The first professors were chosen 
chiefly from two northern colleges, Jefferson, Pa., and Miami, Ohio. 
Of late years the choice has been largely limited to southern institu- 
tions. The first class graduated in 1842; the new school grew rapidly 
in popular favor and support, and at the opening of the Civil War was 
one of the most flourishing denominational schools in the South. 
The founding of this school was the incentive to other noble efforts 
on the part of the denomination. Feeding schools were established and 
liberally supported, and it paved the way for the publication ofa re- 
ligious magazine and religious weeklies. The school has furnished 
many of the ministers of the Church, one-fourth of its graduates up to 
1880 being ministers. 
ENDOWMENTS. 
In the first years of 1ts existence the college relied chiefly on tuition 
fees and the interest from occasional donations and bequests for its sup- 
port. But in 1853 the plan of endowing the institution by the sale-of 
scholarships was vigorously prosecuted, and about fifty thousand dol- 
Jars were raised this way. This was increased to seventy thousand 
dollars by donations from Captain Blair, Christopher Strong, Col. 
William Wright, and others. But the War came on, the college doors 
were closed, and the young men learned at another school on the tented 
field. When they returned to its peaceful walls again, they found the 
buildings and libraries remaining, but the endowment, excepting 
thirteen thousand dollars, and everything else swept away. The people 
who had built and supported it, in common with their brethren through- 
outthe South, were poverty-stricken. Butthe school was reopened, and 
boys who had marched to the tap of the drum now quietly gathered 
in the lecture room at the call of the bell. 
During the first years after its reopening the institution could only 
hope to hve; but in 1871, when prospects seemed fairer, another earn- 
est effort was made to secure a permanent endowment. The plan 
of selling scholarships was successful, and with the addition of some do-

nations and bequests, the endowment was very shortly raised to eighty 
thousand dollars. The largest donation was fifteen thousand dollars, 
from Mrs. Ann Wallace, of Kentucky, and the largest bequest was 
eleven thousand dollars, from Dr. J. W. Hearst, of South Carolina, 
During recent years the life of the school has been uneventful, but 
steadily progressive. 
GRADUATES, 
Its list of graduates contains men who have held positions of honor 
and trast, and who are prominent in their professions. One of them 
is a promising journalist of note, while another is one of the leading 
lawyers at the bar of the national capital. Still another of its alumni, 
J, CO. Maxwell, has represented his district in the State Senate and is 
influential in State politics. The author of the History of the Asso- 
ciate Reformed Synod of the South, Rev. Robert Lathan, D. D., re- 
ceived his diploma there with the class of 1855, which also included in 
its number W. Hood, who afterward became professor in his alma 
mater. The present efficient head of the college finished his course as 
a student within its walls in 1860. 
When the last decennial catalogue was issued in 1880 the whole 
number of graduates was 408. Something over a fourth of these were 
ministers, with nearly every other profession and vocation represented. 
In the list also were men from every southern State. 
REV. R. C. GRIER, D. D. 
To no one man is more credit due for the success of the institution 
than to Rev. R. C. Grier. Like several other great educators of South 
Carolina, he was born in North Carolina, in 1817, of Irish descent. His 
futher, Rev. Isaac Grier, D. D., a native of Georgia, was said to be the 
first Presbyterian minister produced in that State. He sent his son 
to Jefferson College, Pennsylvania, where he graduated in 1835. Going 
South young Grier entered the ministry, and was soon ordained pastor 
of two large and influential churches in the country. The impression he 
created is amply proved by the complimentary resolutions adopted by 
these churches nearly a quarter of a century after, on his death. He 
remained there only seven years, and then accepted the presidency of 
Erskine College, in 1846, and filled that position till his retirement, in 
1858. Immediately on the close of the War he was called to the head 
of the college again, and held the office till his death, in 1871. 
He was one of the ablest men in his denomination in the State, and 
was considered one of the most influential ever connected with the col- 
lege. He was a preacher of no mean order, a fine teacher, and a keen 
logician, and his administrative talents were of the highest order. He 
held a short pastorate in Nashville, Tenn., where he made the acquaint- 
ance of Dr. Thomas Summers, one of the great men of the Methodist

Episcopal Church South. Doctor Summers was so impressed with him 
that he wrote, ‘Dr. Grier was one of the great men of the age, and 
his decease will be deeply deplored.” Other testimonials of high re- 
gard for his character and worth were given in various parts of the 
South. On his death, in 1871, he was succeeded by his son, Rev. W. 
M. Grier, D. D., now the president of the college. These two, father 
and son, have held the office for thirty-five years, nearly three-fourths 
of the life of the school. 
FURMAN UNIVERSITY. 
Just two centuries ago there was organized in Charleston the first 
Baptist church in the South, and to this may be traced the foundation 
of Furman University. The Baptists of the State, commencing with 
this organization of the First Baptist Church of Charleston in 1683, were 
aggressive in spreading the Gospel, and wrung from the Episcopalians, 
in their early missionary efforts, the confession, ‘‘ Wherever we go, we 
find the Baptists before us.” They went forth, first to convert and then 
to educate. Naturally and properly their first aim was to educate the 
ministers, the leaders and teachers of the people, for in those early days 
and in that thinly-settled country a sermon was almost the only intel- 
lectual food the people could get. “As early as 1755 efforts were made 
in the association to provide aid for young men designing to preach the 
Gospel, but laboring under the disadvantages of a want of education.” ! 
The other Baptist churches in the colony co-operated, and in 1757 
one hundred and. thirty-three pounds were raised, sixty pounds being 
given by the Charleston church. A society was then formed for the 
promotion of education, and young men were aided by it in preparing 
for the ministry. This society is probably the first Baptist society for 
this purpose in the United States, as it antedates the one in Philadel- 
phia by at least one year. 
But before the plans could be thoroughly perfected the Revolution 
came on, and the colonies suffered all the ravages that the bitterness of 
a civil conflict could inflict. Shortly after the close of the war, in 1790, 
the cause of education was again taken up, and a regular system adopted 
for educating the young men designed for the ministry. Candidates 
were received and aided with money and books, and two of them were 
sent North for their ministerial education to the Rhode Island College, 
now Brown University. Among the young men receiving aid from these 
Baptists was Jesse Mercer, the father of Baptist education in Georgia. 
But their aims and plans widened, and they wished to bring in the 
whole State, and in this move the Charleston Association led the way. 
They sent out a circular letter, discussion, and appeal to the brethren 
on “ the duty of the churches to provide for the instruction and im- 
provement of persons called by them to the ministry, previous to their   
1 Address by Dr. J. C. Furman, reported in the Baptist Courier, Supplement, No-

entering on the work.” It was the conviction that lay at the bottom 
of this appeal that led to the forming of the State Convention for the 
cause of education. i ; 
But the leading spirit of the Baptists in the State, and one of the 
great leaders of that denomination in the United States, now came 
forward and assumed the direction of the movement, and carried it suc- 
cessfully forward, 
RICHARD FURMAN. 
Richard Furman, in whose honor the college was named, was a native 
of New York, being born there in 1755. His father removed to South 
Carolina when his son was only a few years old. The boy was very 
intelligent, and at an early age showed great fondness for reading the 
Bible. Before he was large enough to hold the family Bible he would 
lay it on a stool, and ask to be taught to read it, and after learning this, 
“reading it was his chief delight.” His memory was very strong, and. 
at the age of seven he memorized nearly all the first book of the Iliad, 
and could repeat it even in middle life. Although his education was 
_ necessarily neglected, he acquired a fair knowledge of Greek and He- 
brew. He was baptized at the age of sixteen and was pastor of a 
church at nineteen. He was a man of strong convictions and of great 
influence over men. He was bold and outspoken for religious freedom, 
and when the sheriff refused him the use of the court-house, he preached 
in the open air. Afterward he preached in Virginia, and there his 
eloquence attracted the attention of the ‘forest Demosthenes,” who 
presented him with a copy of Ward’s Oratory as a token of his high 
esteem and appreciation. 
His knowledge and influence were not limited to the ministry alone, 
but at one time he went into politics, and was sent as a delegate to the 
first constitutional convention of the State. In this body he fearlessly 
and successfully opposed the clause forbidding ministers of the Gospel 
to hold certain offices, maintaining that it was an abridgment of the 
right of the people to elect whom they pleased to any office. In this 
respect his career was followed very closely by Jesse Mercer, the Bap- 
tist leader in Georgia, a quarter of a century later. 
Amid the troublous times of the Revolution Dr. Furman distinguished 
himself as a devoted and fearless patriot. The following interesting 
incident will show what part he took in that memorable struggle. 
Being ona visit to the city of Washington in 1814, he was introduced 
to Mr. Monroe, then a member of the cabinet, as Mr. Furman, of Charles- 
ton. Mr. Monroe, on taking his hand, remarked thoughtfully, as if 
trying to recall something, “ Furman, Furman, of Charleston; the name 
and the countenance seem familiar. May I inquire if you once lived 
near the High Hills of Santee?” He was auswered in the affirmative. 
“And were you the young preacher who fled for protection to the Amer- 
ican camp on account of the reward Lord Cornwallis had offered for his 
 
-P-A-G-E-102
  94 HIGHER EDUCATION IN SOUTH CAROLINA. 
head?” “Iam the same,” replied Dr. Furman. Their interview was 
deeply affecting, and Mr. Monroe did not permit him to leave until he 
had related to the distinguished bystanders the circumstances to which 
he had alluded. It seems that Dr. Furman had been not only a Baptist 
preacher, but an ardent Whig at the crisis of the Revolutionary War. 
Everywhere he preached resistanee to the British. Urged by the Tories, 
Lord Cornwallis, who had been made acquainted with his influence and 
daring, offered a thousand pounds for his head. Ascertaining that the 
Tories were on his track, Furman fled to the American camp, where, by 
his prayers and eloquent appeals, he reassured and excited the hopes 
of the soldiers, insomuch that it was reported that Lord Cornwallis re- 
marked that he “feared the prayers of that godly youth more than he 
did the soldiers of Sumter or Marion.” 
At the request of Mr. Monroe, Dr. Furman preached in the hall of 
the House of Representatives. He became pastor of the First Baptist 
Church in Charleston, and continued in office until his death, which 
occurred in 1825. He was a man of broad views and far-reaching pur- 
poses, but he never showed his breadth and greatness more than in his 
plan for a \ 
NATIONAL UNIVERSITY. 
In 1814 the first General Baptist Convention was held in Philadel- 
phia, and Richard Furman was elected president of it. Although the 
meeting was called chiefly to consider the question of missionary enter- 
prises, yet at the end of this business the president made an address to 
the body, and strongly urged upon the Baptists the importance of pro- 
viding educational institutions. This plan was, first and chiefly, to pre- 
empt the ground at Washington, and thus nationalize the educational 
movement at the start. This institution was to be fed by State schools 
and academies supported by the Baptists in each State, while it was to 
be maintained by all. The plan was favorably received, and, without 
going into the history of the efforts, finally resulted in the establish- 
ment of the Columbian University at Washington, which unfortunately 
fell into financial straits. It was finally released from more than half a 
century of embarrassment by the munificence of the philanthropist, 
W. W. Corcoran. The secondary schools, which never became auxil- 
iaries, but developed into rivals, were established in several places, at 
Waterville, at Newton, at Rochester, at Hamilton, in South Carolina, 
and in Georgia. The central institution was never nationalized, and 
one can not help conjecturing, with the eloquent son of the projector, as 
to what might have been its influence in uniting the country, if the jeal- 
ousy of the local schools had not frustrated the grand design. It was 
truly a day of small beginnings but of mighty purposes.
-P-A-G-E-103

FOUNDING OF FURMAN ACADEMY. 
Richard Furman, having begun the central institution, set to work 
to establish the South Carolina auxiliary. To do this it was necessary 
to get the aid of the Baptists, and consequently these had to be united 
in some way. The church at the High Hilis of the Santee, of which he 
had once been pastor, suggested the formation of a general association, 
and this was taken up by his church in Charleston and recommended 
to that Association. A committee, of which he was a member, issued 
an address, fixed a day, and thus paved the way for the formation of 
the Convention. The fundamental aim was to promote educational 
and missionary interests. 
Dr. Jokn M. Roberts, who had been educated for the ministry by the 
old First Baptist Church, of Charleston, was the pastor of the church 
at the High Hills cf the Santee, and had established an academy there, 
and from this academy Furman University has grown. When the Con- 
vention was finally formed in 1825, this school was chosen for the educa- 
tion of the young men who were assisted by the Convention. But in 
afew years, in hope of co-operation with Georgia, an academy called 
“Furman Academy ” was located at Edgefield. Georgia failing to co- 
onerate, the school was removed to the High Hills of the Santee, and 
shortly afterward located at Fairfield. At this place that curious fea- 
ture, ‘manual labor,” was engrafted on it, and in addition to the theo- 
logical department English and classical courses were added, to meet 
the wants of many Baptist youth who were not studying for the min- 
istry. The project failed, and, in addition, the largest building was 
set on fire by a depraved student, and the instruction afterward was 
limited to theological students only, the school being called “Furman 
Theological Institution.” 
DEVELOPMENT OF THE UNIVERSITY. 
The success of the theological school prompted some of the more 
enterprising members of the denomination to go further. Moreover, 
the course of Thomas Cooper in the State institution awakened the re- 
ligious feeling against the teaching of infidel views, and after a discus- 
sion in the denominational papers, the Convention voted unanimously 
to erect a college. Several sites were offered, and finally Greenville 
was chosen as the point of location. A beautiful eminence overlooking 
the little town, and a large campus of thirty acres covered with natural 
growth, was the situation finally adopted. The town is in the northern 
part of the State near the mountains, of which fine views are obtained. 
It is the centre of Baptist influence in the State, and has always lib- 
erally patronized the school. 
In founding the school, the president of the Convention, Dr. W. B. 
Johnson, issued an address to the Baptists of the State, in which he 
declared the principles on which it was built, and on which it rests 
 
-P-A-G-E-104
  
  96 HIGHER EDUCATION IN SOUTH CAROLINA. 
to-day: “The Convention also desires to have an institution in which 
the young men of the denomination may receive a liberal education 
under the influence of those denominational views which their parents 
receive and cherish. The course of instruction and government in the 
University will be conducted with a sacred regard to the interests of 
morality and religion, the principles of Christian liberality, and in favor 
of the rights of private judgment. It will be a denominational, not a 
sectarian, institution.” This has been strictly followed, since no attend- 
ance on divine worship is ever enforced, and no sectarian teaching is 
ever heard within its walls. 
He was very careful to state that “ the Convention is not influenced 
by a spirit of opposition or rivalry to the college of the State,” or “of 
setting up an opposing interest” to it; but he also thought that “the 
time has arrived when, in the acknowledged difficulty of sustaining 
good moral discipline at our colleges, each considerable division of the 
Church will do well to throw a paternal shield over its own youth.” 
This care not to antagonize in any way the State school is quite in con- 
trast with the spirit of the past few years, when an attempt has been 
made to close it entirely. 
Appeals were made for subscriptions, ~ agents were sent out. The 
whole was successful, as the Baptists in the State then had some wealtlry 
members. A Bante was obtained in 1850,! and one hundred and fifty 
thousand dollars worth of bonds having been subscribed, the school 
was opened in 1852. The title of “ University” was an unfortunate one, 
since the school, owing to circumstances, has been forced to confine 
itself to academic training only. But the intention at the start was to 
have an academic, a collegiate, a theological, and a law department; 
the last, indeed, was on the point of being established when the War 
came on. 
The theological department became the nucleus of the Southern Bap- 
tist Theological Seminary, now a flourishing institution at Louisville, 
Ky. The trustees of the University offered the thirty thousand dollars 
that had been raised for the theological department to start a semi- 
nary for the whole South, on condition that the other States would sub- 
scribe liberally. 
In common with the most of southern institutions the school was 
practically closed during the War, and lost nearly all its endowment. It 
was afterward reopened, and on the closing of the State college nobly 
tried to aid the impoverished youth of the State by offering free tuition, 
on the strength of two hundred thousand dollars worth of bonds that 
‘had been subscribed. The plan of free tuition was a failure, and the 
school was reorganized in 1881; since then a moderate tuition fee has 
been charged. . 
At present the outlook is very promising, the number of students 
being larger than at any other session since the War, and approaching 
1 Statutes at Large, Vol. XII, p. ee

the attendance during the prosperous years before that struggle. The 
buildings have been improved and the laboratories fitted up, and a 
plan is now on foot to build dormitories. The latter may be a bad 
move, since the friends of the college have rightly boasted that there 
has never been anything in the nature of a rebellion in the history of 
the college, and ascribe this to the absence of dormitories. It might 
be far better to build a gymnasium, and give Furman the honor of in- 
troducing that feature of advanced colleges into the State. 
TRAINING AT THE UNIVERSITY. 
The influence of the University of Virginia is clearly seen here in the 
organization of independent schools, and in the work of men trained 
within her walls. For many years two of the five professors were 
graduates of that institution. One of the most prominent of them is C. 
H. Judson, a native of Massachusetts and an A. M. of the University 
of Virginia. His course in mathematics has been advanced for so small 
an institution, and always thorough. C. H. Toy, now in the Semitic 
department at Harvard, was also on the academic staff of Furman 
University for several years. The University claims, and probably de- 
serves, the credit of having introduced the plan of written examinations 
into the State as the test of scholarship for the students. The schools 
have been arranged on the basis of the University of Virginia, but are 
not so numerous. The following are the usual schools for the greater 
part of the time: Latin, Greek, mathematics, natural philosophy, chem- 
istry and natural history, logic, rhetoric and evidences of Christianity, 
and intellectual and moral philosophy. The leading degree has been 
the old A. B., based on Latin, Greek, and mathematics, with two other 
minor degrees based on science; and thus some election is* allowed in 
working for a degree. 
Political economy, elements of the common law, the law of nations, 
and the Constitution of the United States were taught in the first years, 
Wayland being used in political economy, and Calhoun on Government. 
These branches were practically discontinued after the War, revived in 
1882, and again discontinued several years ago. There has never been 
any regular course in. history. 
Furman University has educated some men prominent in the State, 
the most distinguished probably being J. C. Shephard, Lieutenant- 
Governor and Governor of the State; W. L. Mauldin, now Lieutenant- 
Governor; W.H. Perry, now Member of Oongress. But none of these 
graduated, though the first two received all their collegiate training 
there. One of the most promising scholars ever graduated at the Uni- 
versity is Professor Bloomfield, now at the head of the Sanskrit depart- 
ment of the Johns Hopkins University. He came from Chicago to get 
the benefit of Professor Toy’s instruction, then studied under Professor 
Whitney at Yale, then in Germany, and finally graduated at the Johns 
Hopkins University.

WOFFORD COLLEGE. 
The Methodists were among the last of the denominations to enter 
the educational field in South Carolina, yet there can be no doubt of 
their interest in the work. <As early as 1824 the State Conference 
passed a resolution to establish a school for the children of itinerant 
preachers and for orphan children.' . 
This probably never went much further, as there are no more traces 
of it, possibly owing to the weakness of the denomination at that time. 
Nothing more of importance was done until the foundation of Wofford 
College, which is the only institution in the State that owes its exist- 
ence to the munificence of one man. 
BENJAMIN WOFFORD. 
As of John Harvard, very little is known of Benjamin Wofford, 
though he died not quite forty years ago. This will not seem so strange 
when it is remembered that very little material exists for the lives of 
even the most prominent men inthe State. Von Holst regrets the lack 
of material for the private life of John O. Calhoun, and was limited 
almost entirely to a history of his public career. On the death of Wil- 
liam ©. Preston it was desired to write a biography of him, but the in- 
tention had to be abandoned, as there was scarcely any material pre- 
served. Naturally there are few materials preserved for the biography 
of a man who attracted no public attention in his life except by a gift 
made a short time before his death. 
It is known, however, that he was born in Spartanburg County, in 
the upper part of South Carolina, in 1780, his parents having come 
there from Pennsylvania, after Braddock’s defeat... In that sparsely 
settled country he had almost no advantages of education. There were 
no Methodist preachers near him, as the Presbyterians and Baptists 
were the first to break ground with their missionary labors. At the 
age of twenty he attended the first camp-meeting probably ever held 
in the State, and then was much impressed by George Dougherty, the 
presiding elder, and Lewis Myers, the circuit rider. The latter was a 
very careful, economical German, and amassed a respectable fortune. 
it is likely that Benjamin Wofford was strongly attracted by this eco- 
nomic trait in the character of Myers, for his life was thrifty and suc- 
cessful from a business point of view. 
He felt called to preach, entered the Methodist ministry, and became 
a circuit rider. The first year his circuit reached from Nashville to 
Cincinnati. Asa preacher he is hardly remembered, but his success 
was in gathering riches. In his dealings he was inflexibly just, but 
never benevolent. From his careful methodical habits, it is easily in- 
ferred that he had some purpose of benefaction in his mind from early

years. At one time he made an offer for the Limestone Springs prop- 
erty, but refused to take it on some slight difference as to rate of 
interest. He consulted Rev. H. A. C. Walker as to founding a college, 
and offered to give one hundred thousand dollars toward it. At that 
date it was the largest amount, with few exceptions, ever given in the 
United States by one person for educational purposes, and up to the 
present time it has not been equalled by any Methodist in the South, 
nor by any one else in South Carolina, except by E. M. Baynard in his 
gift of one hundred and sixty-eight thousand dollars to the College of 
Charleston. 
In his will he provided for “ establishing a college for literary, classi- 
eal, and scientific education, to be located in my native district, Spar- 
tanburg, and to be under the control and management of the Confer- 
ence of the Methodist Episcopal Church of my native State, South 
Carolina.” One-half of the amount was given for purchase of land and 
erection of buildings, and the remainder for a permanent fund. The 
endowment was increased to seventy thousand dollars by additions from 
various sources, including five thousand dollars from G. W. Williams, 
of Charleston, for ministerial education. But the whole was invested 
in Confederate bonds, and the college suffered the entire loss of it. 
On his death, in 1850, the trustees began the 
ORGANIZATION OF THE COLLEGE. 
A charter was obtained in 1851.!_ The faculty was composed of Rev. 
W. M. Wightman, president; David Duncan, professor of languages ; 
James H. Carlisle, professor of mathematics; Warren Du Pré, profes- 
sor of natural science. A professor of English literature, Whitefoord 
Smith, was added the following year. The entrance examinations were 
placed about as high as those of South Carolina College, while the ~ 
A. B. degree required four years of work, mainly in Latin, Greek, and 
mathematics. History was a four years’ course, but political economy 
was taught only the last term of the last year. The Bible was a required 
study for the whole term. ‘ 
Some of the rules seem rather peculiar, considering the freedom at 
many colleges now. Students were forbidden to attend the theatre or 
a party at a public place. Another rule read, “The faculty regard late 
suppers or convivial reunions in the back rooms of stores as open to 
grave censure on many accounts, and as altogether improper.” Strict 
regard for the Sabbath and “habitual attendance on religious services 
are enjoined on all students.” 
The influence of the University of Virginia is here seen again in the 
adoption of the school system of organization. Before the War the 
pupils were thoroughly trained at the academies through the State, 
and were sufficiently advanced to appreciate the power of electives, and 
  
1 Statutes at Large, Vol. XII, p. 90.

at that time the plan worked well. But after the War, with the train- 
ing schools destroyed, the faculty felt constrained to announce the aban- 
donment of the school system in 1885, in the following words: ‘The 
elementary character of its matriculates, and the limited number of its 
instructors, have constrained Wofford College to abandon the school 
system.” They offered instead two courses of study leading to degrees. 
But in their last catalogue the studies are still arranged by schools, 
DEBATING SOCIETIES. 
A striking feature is the attention paid to debating societies, which 
are so rapidly falling into disuse through the Northand West. To keep 
up a spirit of emulation, provision is usually made for two, and rooms 
are set apart for this purpose by the faculty. The influence of Calhoun 
and Preston is seen in the names of the two societies. These societies 
“are regarded by both students and faculty as an indispensable part 
of the machinery of instruction. * * * The beneficial influence of 
these societies confirms the authorities in enforcing the rule that every 
student shall connect himself with one of them.” Again, they declare 
that the societies ‘ constitute an imperium in imperio, and, by contrib- , 
uting to the moral soundness of the college, are viewed as important 
adjuncts to the safe and easy administration of discipline.” The halls 
are large and handsomely furnished, and each society has a library of 
several hundred volumes. The meetings are fully attended, and some 
of the exercises are interesting and improving. 
COURSE IN ENGLISH. 
Among the advances made by the college, none is more important 
than the course in English. This school was taught several years ago 
by Professor Baskerville, who now has a good course in Vanderbilt 
University. After his election to the place in Nashville the chair 
was occupied by Prof. T, C. Woodward. Professor Woodward grad- 
uated at Randolph-Macon, in Virginia, where he attracted the notice 
of Professor Price, now of Columbia College, New York. Professor 
Woodward, in calling attention to the importance of the study of Eng- 
lish, said: ‘¢ With a pitiable reversal of the natural order, we have, for 
several hundred years past, Hellenized and Romanized our educational 
systems, leaving our own speech to get itself taught by help of these 
as best it might; now, however, reason has come to our aid, and the 
student is given a fair allowance of English straw with which to make 
his classical bricks, and may be permitted by and by to use real English 
stuff in his philological building. * * * Nowhere bas this move- 
ment found greater favor than in the South. * * * Itis a hopeful 
sign in the making of our New South that the advance in educational 
work is led by this revival of English study, and this revival is based 
on a serious conviction that whether in the learned or servile arts a 
   
-P-A-G-E-109

* sensible and forcible use of one’s native speech is as helpful as money 
or influence or talent.” This course covers four years, and includes a 
thorough study of the elements, history of English literature, critical 
analysis of some of the masterpieces, Anglo-Saxon, Old and Middle 
English, with numerous exercises. The course is very full for an insti- 
tution whose students come so little prepared for real college work. 
Professor Woodward was elected to the chair of English in the State 
university in 1888. His place at Wofford was filled by Prof. A. W. 
Long, of North Carolina, who had taken a graduate course in English 
at the Johns Hopkins University some time previous. 
THE GRADUATES. 
The graduates number nearly three hundred, principally natives of 
the State. Many of them now occupy places of honor, a large number 
being teachers throughout the South. Probably more are in the min- 
istry than in any other vocation. The first graduate, Samuel Dibble, 
is very prominent in politics, being now one of the most influential 
members of Congress from South Carolina. Several of its professors 
- are graduates of the school, as W. W. Duncan, now bishop of the Meth- 
odist Episcopal Church South, W. D. Kirkland, J. A. Gamewell, A. 
Coke Smith, and Charles F. Smith. Some lawyers of reputation have 
been trained there, as W. H. Folk and J. R. Abney. One of the best 
known of its graduates in scholarship is Charles F. Smith, now pro- 
fessor of Greek in Vanderbilt University. Heis a graduate of aGerman 
University, and first held a position in Smith College, Massachusetts, 
and has lately written some philological articles of a high order. 
NEWBERRY COLLEGE. 
The Evangelical Lutheran Synod of South Carolina, in 1856, having 
resolved to establish ‘a classical and literary institution,” elected a 
board of trustees, obtained a charter, and in 1858 completed a large and 
attractive college edifice at Newberry, S. C., at a cost of twenty thou- 
sand dollars. In the second session the enrolment of students was 
one hundred and seventy-five. The endowment reached fifty thousand 
dollars by 1860, and the entire property of the college was valued at 
seventy-five thousand dollars. From 1861 to 1865 the doors were prac- 
tically closed, and the professors and students obeyed the call of their 
country. As was the case with the other denominational colleges, the 
endowment was lost by investment in Confederate securities. After- 
ward the college buildings were sold for debt, and the institution was 
removed to Walhalla, the citizens of that place having made favor- 
able proposals for its location there. It remained there struggling 
with embarrassments for nine years, when it was again located at New- 
berry. Since then a small endowment of twelve thousand dollars has 
been raised, to which generous patrons of education in Boston contrib- 
   
-P-A-G-E-110

uted four thousand dollars. The attendance during recent years has 
averaged about one hundred, and the outlook for the college is prom- 
ising. i 
The following extract from a recent sketch of the college gives a 
summary of its work and a word as to its present condition: 
“The faculty of the college at the time of its relocation at Newberry 
was as follows: The Rev. G. W. Holland, president; D. Arrington, 
G. D. Haltiwanger, and George B. Cromer. It may be worth while to 
put on record the fact that the first four months of the session of 
1877-78, the first after the return to Newberry, were spent in the rooms 
now occupied by Mr. Salter as a photograph gallery. In February, 
1878, the college building was so far completed as to permit of occu- 
pancy, and since that time the exercises have been regularly continued. 
“Since the founding of the college seventy-seven young men have 
been graduated, the first graduation being in 1869. Of this number 
five are dead. Of the living seventy-two alumni, sixteen are farmers 
and merchants, eleven are teachers, nine are physicians, eleven are 
lawyers, and twenty-five are clergymen or in course of preparation for 
the ministry. 
“The college has a well selected library of seven thousand five 
hundred volumes; a valuable and intere3ting collection of mineralog- 
ical and natural history specimens, known as the Sifley Museum; chem- 
ical and philosophical apparatus; two literary societies, which meet 
weekly in well furnished halls; and other appliances for doing first- 
class work. 
_ “There are three departments in the college: Preparatory, collegiate, 
and technical. The preparatory course covers a period of three years, 
and is designed to fit young men for college or for active life. The 
collegiate department is divided into two courses, the classical, leading 
to the degree of bachelor of arts, and the philosophical, leading to 
that of bachelor of philosophy. 
“The faculty of the college at present is: Rev. G. W. Holland, D. D., 
Ph. D., president, mental and moral science and English literature; O. 
B. Mayer, M. D., physiology and hygiene ; ———-—, Latin, Greek, and 
Hebrew; Rev. A. G. Voigt, A. M., German and French; Rev. J. B. Fox, 
A. M., mathematics and natural sciences; Thomas H. Dreher, A. M., 
preparatory department; W. C. Schott, instructor in technical depart- 
ment. F 
“The resignation of Prof. H. Dysinger during the past summer 
caused a vacancy in the faculty which has not yet been filled. Prof. 
George G. Sall has been giving valuable help during the present ses- 
sion. ; 
“Dr. O. B. Mayer has been a member of the faculty from the found- 
ing of the college, except the few years the college was conducted at 
Walhalla.” 
!News and Courier, March 31, 1889.

_EDUCATION OF WOMEN. 103 
The technical department at present includes the usual course in 
commercial colleges, and is very successful in meeting the demand for 
business training. This department is designed to meet the wants of 
young men who have limited means, or who do not care to pursue a 
full course of study. 
ADGER COLLEGE. 
This is the youngest of the denominational colleges, having been or- 
ganized only in 1877. When Newberry College was removed from Wal- 
halla to Newberry, after having been located in the former place for 
nine years, the citizens of Walhalla determined to establish an institu- 
tion in their midst. Subscriptions were taken up regardless of denom- 
inational lines, and the college was formally opened in the autumn of 
1877. As the other leading sects in the State already had colleges 
under their control, it was resolved to place this under the care and 
direction of the Presbyterians, and that body accepted the charge 
in September, 1877. The location is in a small town within four miles 
of the Blue Ridge Mountains, a range of the Appalachian chain. The 
people are moral, energetic, and industrious, and are mostly white, the 
ratio being four whites to one colored in the county. In the case of 
nearly every other college for whites in the State, the surrounding 
population is more colored than white. 
The endowment is small, and the faculty consists of only four. The 
average attendance has been about eighty, but the prospects for an im- 
provement are growing brighter. The name “Adger” was given in 
honor of a family that has long been prominently identified with the 
Presbyterian Church. 
When the permanent organization was effected, in June, 1882, the 
following staff was elected: Rev. F. P. Mullally, D. D., president; Rey. 
J. R. Riley, D. D., professor of languages; Rev. H. Strong, professor 
of natural sciences; and W. 8. Moore, A. B., professor of mathematics. 
FEMALE EDUCATION. 
The schools for the education of women are almost entirely the work 
of the denominations. : 
For the first half of the century in South Carolina, as well as in other 
States, there were no schools of advanced grade for women. The pub- 
lic sentiment did not favor such institutions. Reared in luxury and 
among a chivalric people, women received the most unbounded honor, 
and even adulation. The bearing of the men toward them was almost 
as extravagant as in medieval days. Their education was confined to 
the acquirement of certain accomplishments, such as music, painting, 
wax-working, and fancy needle-work. These were provided for in acad- 
emies and boarding schools. But while the boys were bravely plod- 
ding through calculus and scanning Horace and stumbling over the 
   
-P-A-G-E-112

104 HIGHER EDUCATION IN SOUTH CAROLINA. 
hard constructions in Thucydides, their sisters were going through a 
more elementary course and acquiring many accomplishments. The 
State, which founded the South Carolina College and appropriated 
twenty-four thousand dollars annually for the military academies, has 
never been disposed to expend a dollar for her daughters, except at 
Claflin and the Winthrop Training School, and unless the various de- 
rominations had come to their aid they would probably be without these 
advantages to-day. Co-education was so overwhelmingly opposed by 
public sentiment that it would have been a useless privilege to offer it to 
women, as has been done in some of the Western States. Even now it 
is little favored, there being in the high school courses in many places 
a strong sentiment against it. 
With such indifference to female education, it is not to be wondered 
at that the percentage of illiteracy was so high. ‘In 1850 females 
constituted 62 per cent. of the adult illiterate population of South Caro- 
lina; in 1860, 60 per cent.; and in 1870 and 1880, 59 per cent. In 1870 
and in 1880, females constituted 51 per cent. of the entire population. 
Turning to the census of 1870, we find that there are more illiterate fe- 
males than males in all save three States of the Union—California, 
Nevada, and Vermont. In these, females show the following propor- 
tion: California, in population, 40 per cent.; in illiteracy, 44 per cent. 
Nevada, in population, 24 per cent.; in illiteracy, 20 per cent. Ver- 
mont, in population, 49 per cent.; in illiteracy, 48 per cent. In only 
two States, Nevada and Vermont, can females claim educational supe- 
riority over males. South Carolina compares favorably with the other 
States. The percentage of females as to population and illiteracy is, 
respectively, as follows: Alabama, 51 and 65; Georgia, 51 and 65; In- 
diana, 47 and 61; Kentucky, 49 and 59; Massachusetts, 51 and 63; 
New Jersey, 50 and 60; New York, 560 and 61; North Carolina, 52 and 
65; Pennsylvania, 50 and 65; Rhode Island, 51 and 62; South Caro- 
lina, 51 and 59; Virginia, 51 and 59,” 
PRIVATE FEMALE SCHOOLS. 
There were many institutions for the education of women throughout 
the State. But probably no one was more widely known than that of 
the Rey. Thomas Curtis, and his son, William Curtis, of England, at 
the Limestone Springs, in Spartanburg district. In 1835 a hotel had 
been built there with the design of making it a watering place. But 
want of transportation defeated the aim, and the large building was 
bought in 1846 by these gentlemen, who established a female school. 
“Their administrations are a part of the history of the State. The 
thorough instruction, the refined home influence, the salubrious climate 
offered to pupils, attracted large numbers, and Limestone Springs be- 
came almost as famous as Doctor Waddel’s school, at Willington, in 
1 Davis, in Hand-Book, pp. 513-14.
-P-A-G-E-113
  EDUCATION OF WOMEN. 105 
former years.” At the close of the War this jnstitution changed hands 
several times, and finally Peter Cooper, the eminent philanthropist, 
became owner, and intended to establish a technical school for women. 
He subsequently presented it to the Spartanburg Baptist Association, 
which now has control of it. 
Dr. W. B. Johnson, a leader among the Baptists, also taught a school 
that was widely patronized. According to the exigencies of his pro- 
fession it was located at different times at Greenville, Anderson, and 
Edgefield. His pupils are scattered through South Carolina and Geor- 
gia, and they speak with veneration of his discipline and admonitions. 
He was a man of unusual powers of mind, and was for three years 
president of the General Baptist Convention of the United States, and 
for many years of the Georgia Baptist Convention. He was one of 
the most prominent theologians in his denomination, and “contributed 
largely to current religious literature.” Brown University conferred 
the degree of D. D. upon him in 1833. 
Dr. Elias Marks, a minister in the Methodist church, for many years 
conducted a flourishing female seminary at Columbia. He was a gen- 
tleman of taste, and the various accomplishments demanded for girls 
at that time were taught in a refined way in his school. 
All three of these schools were non-sectarian, and each was the pri- 
vate effort of the man at the head of it. There were many others of 
this character through the State, but these have now been largely re- 
placed by denominational institutions. 
GENERAL VIEW OF THE COLLEGES FOR WOMEN. 
According to a recent Report of the United States Commissioner of 
Education,' there are six “institutions for the superior instruction of 
women” reported from the State. Three of them are non-sectarian; 
the others are due, respectively, to the efforts of the Baptists, Method- 
ists,and Associate Reformed Presbyterians. The whole number of in- 
structors is sixty-three. Five of these institutions report collegiate 
departments, and four of these five, preparatory departments. The 
whole nuinber of students in the five is seven hundred and seven; of 
these, only two hundred and forty-two are in the collegiate department. 
Nearly all the instructors are females. There are no graduate students, 
and only two scholarships are reported. Only five of them report libra- 
ries, whose aggregate amounts to three thousand three hundred vol- 
umes, with an increase during the past year of one hundred and fifty 
volumes. The value of “ grounds, buildings, and apparatus” of the 
five is one hundred and one thousand dollars. The amount of “ pro- 
ductive funds” of the four reporting is only six thousand one hundred 
dollars, while the income from the ‘productive funds” is only four hun- 
dred and thirty dollars.

COURSE OF STUDY. 
From the large number of pupils in the preparatory department it is 
seen that much attention must be paid to this. In fact, nearly all of 
them have a primary department in addition. It is difficult to give a 
comparative idea of the grades in the colleges, but generally the train- 
ing given by this preparatory department about equals that given in 
good public city schools. It finishes geography, an elementary History 
of the United States, arithmetic, and the ordinary course in English 
grammar. Two of them commence Latin in the preparatory depart- 
ment. Two of them, Greenville and Columbia, have the famous school 
system of the University of Virginia, the others the usual college course 
of four years. Latin is studied about four years in all, comprising the 
usual course in Cxsar, Virgil, Cicero, and, in one or two, Sallust and 
Horace, with some attention to prose composition and metres. Greek 
is offered in four of them but not required inany. The course in math- 
ematics extends no further than trigonometry, with practical survey 
ing in one. French or German is required in all. History is taught 
in all, but only elementary history, both ancient and modern. The 
remaining ordinary college branches are studied—logic, mental and 
moral philosophy, and elements of the sciences. In the latter no labo- 
ratory practice is offered, except in one or two schools. Every one has 
the usual art and music departments, and a few of them have the be- 
ginnings of a museum. Some of them give the degree of ‘mistress of 
arts,” while others give only certificates of graduation, but one or two 
give the regular A. B. degree. While the course is not very advanced, 
there is a gradual improvement, as great, perhaps, as the circumstances 
will permit. There being practically no endowments, the expenses have 
to be met chiefly from the tuition fees. Even the denominational col- 
leges get scarcely any aid from the churches, most of the contributions 
going to the male schools. None of these colleges have been founded 
very long, the oldest being organized about 1854. 
THE BAPTIST SCHOOL. 
“In 1853 the Baptist State Convention of South Carolina appointed a 
committee to take into consideration the subject of female education as 
a denominational interest.” At the meeting in 1854 the committee re- 
ported, urging the establishment of a “female college of high order,” and 
recommended that ‘the standard of attainment be high.” The school 
was soon after established at Greenville, where it has continued to the 
present, its attendance now being greater than at any previous time. 
THE METHODIST SCHOOL. 
The Methodist school at Columbia is probably the outgrowth of the 
' well-known school of Dr. Elias Marks. In the prosperous years be-
-P-A-G-E-115
  EDUCATION OF WOMEN. 107 
tween 1850 and 1860 the Methodists decided to have a female college, as 
they had organized a male school at Wofford. The school was opened 
in 1859, but was closed on the surrender of the city, in February, 1865, 
and remained closed till 1873. It is under the control of the Confer- 
ence, and is now succeeding very well. 
THE DUE WEST FEMALE COLLEGE 
(Associate Reformed Presbyterian) was founded in 1860 by a company 
of citizens with a purely public spirit. Its first president, Rev. J. I. 
Bonner, was a very capable, efficient man, and thoroughly organized 
the school. 
The above three schools were founded just before the War, and could 
hardly have gotten into good working order before the upheaval came. 
In the utter prostration of enterprises and the general poverty conse- 
quent on the War, nothing was done for several years, although there 
were a few feeble efforts to maintain such institutions as were already. 
in operation. 
REVIVAL OF EFFORTS AFTER THE CIVIL WAR. 
But when time had changed these hard conditions, men vigorously 
turned their attention to the subject that had so greatly interested them 
in the preceding years. The results were seen in the new colleges. It 
might have been better if they had contented themselves with an earnest 
support of existing institutions; but local pride was strong, and the 
schools were needed in their immediate localities for the poor children. 
The public school system, it must be remembered, was not yet in good 
working order. The thorough training schools of the former period had 
all been swept away, and the newly established colleges in large part 
took their place. The highest praise is due to the men who tried to 
reconstruct the.school system, but their efforts would probably have 
done more good if they had called their new-founded institutions acad- 
emies instead of colleges. 
During the decade from 1870 to 1880 three of these institutions were 
opened,—the Walhalla Female College at Walhalla; the Williamston 
Female College, at Williamston, both in 1872; and the Anderson Female 
Seminary in 1879. AJl of these are non-sectarian. They were all 
founded by the earnest efforts of men in their respective localities sub- 
scribing their money for that purpose. Determined to educate their 
daughters, they thought it much cheaper in the long run to bring the 
schools to their doors; but they could not sacrifice the honor and pres- 
tige of a college course, so they called them colleges. These schools 
offer a curriculum as full as that of the older ones, and the training is 
substantially the same. 
In addition, there are good academies for girls in different parts of 
the State, especially in Charleston. In that city from the close of the

  108 HIGHER EDUCATION IN SOUTH CAROLINA. 
Revolutionary War to the present time, in addition to the schools where 
the elementary and higher branches of English have been taught, there 
have always been schools under the charge of accomplished teachers, 
at which young ladies were taught belles lettres, French, music, and 
painting, and were afforded all the advantages of a fashionable educa- 
tion. hese schools were equal to any in the Union, and were largely 
patronized. 
Notable among these is Miss Kelly’s school, which not only has a 
local patronage, but draws pupils from other sections of the State, and 
from’ beyond the limits of the State. At the present time nearly every 
county town where the advantages of health are good has its female 
school or college, where the girls of the vicinity are educated. At 
these schools, in addition to the elementary branches, music, painting, 
and French are generally taught, and the advantages of a good educa- 
tion are within the reach of all. 
THE WILLIAMSTON FEMALE COLLE(+E. 
The Williamston Female College offers some features worthy of 
special notice. It is largely the work of one man, Rey. S. Lander, of 
the Methodist Episcopal Church South. He follows the one-study plan, 
and has found it to be attended with the greatest success. Although he 
has no regular fixed scholarships, yet he offers to the students induce- 
ments that work more effectively than any other system of scholarships 
could work. He makes deductions from the tuition fees according to 
the standing of the pupil. For an average standing of 80 to 85, a dis- 
count of ten per cent. is made; of 85 to 90, twenty per cent.; of 90 to 
94, thirty per cent.; 94 to 97, forty per cent.; 97 to 100, fifty per cent. 
It certainly makes the students apply themselves as closely as they 
could under any plan.

CHAPTER VI. 
FREE SCHOOLS AND EDUCATION OF THE NEGRO. 
Although South Caroiina was settled in the last quarter of the sev- 
enteenth century, there was no systematic effort of the people as a 
whole toward providing popular education until 1811. But it is not 
to be inferred from this that there were no educational advantages at 
all. Most of the people were able to educate their own children with- 
out aid, but the middle class needed assistance, although it was not 
large enough to warrant the maintenance of schools throughout the 
country for its especial benefit. The country was sparsely settled, as 
there had been from the earliest foundation of the colony a tendency to- 
ward the formation of large plantations. Owing to this condition of 
affairs the hand of charity was stretched forth to aid the poor white 
people at an early period. 
         
          
    
        
   
       
     
    EARLY FREE SCHOOLS.! 
The first free school successfully established in South Carolina was 
founded in Charleston in 1710. Previous to that time the people of the 
State had conceived the idea of establishing free schools, but it was not 
until 1710 that legislative action was taken in that direction. In 1712 
another act was passed, incorporating certain persons under the desig- 
mation of commissioners, for founding, erecting, governing, and visiting 
ja free school for the use of the inhabitants of South Carolina, with full 
uthority to receive all gifts and legacies formerly given to the use of 
he free school, and to purchase as much land as might be deemed nec- 
essary for the use of the school, and to erect thereon suitable buildings. 
The gentlemen named in this act constituted the first Board of Free 
School Commissioners in the State. 
There was a feeling in favo of popular education with many of 
he leaders. Sir Francis Nichdbon, the first Royal Governor, was a 
reat friend of learning, and did very much to encourage it, and men 
f wealth bequeathed large sums for establishing free schools. The 
ociety for Propagating the Gospel in Foreign Parts was active in 
ounding schools and supplying books. It started a school at Goose 
Sreek in 1710, and another at Dorchester in 1724, in response to a peti- 
ion for aid. But as indicating the spirit of the people, it is important

to notice the act of February, 1722. By this it was provided that jus- 
tices of the county courts be authorized to erect a free school in each 
county and precinct, to be supported by assessments on land and ne- 
groes. Such schools were bound to teach ten poor children free, if sent 
by the justices. 
The private donations, also, were liberal for a small colony. Richard) 
Beresford, in 1721, bequeathed six thousand five hundred pounds for the} 
education of the poor; in 1732 Richard Harris bequeathed one thousand) 
pounds for the same object; and in 1728 Rey. Richard Ludlam gave} 
his whole estate of two thousand pounds, which with other bequests} 
amounted to over fifteen thousand pounds by 1778. ‘For nearly a 
century four schools were maintained with the proceeds of this latter 
bounty,” and they were flourishing up to the War, when the fund was 
finally swept away. There were other funds, but it is Weedless to refer 
to them, as these are sufficient to show the state of feeling. There were 
a number of societies organized at intervals down to 1811 that were of 
great assistance in this work.!| In 1798 another attempt seems to have 
been made by the Government, in the appointment of trustees to ex- 
amine free schools in Orangeburg, but with no definite results. 
GENERAL FRANCIS MARION ON POPULAR EDUCATION. 
That there were prominent men who keenly felt the need of popular 
education by the Government is seen in a conversation that General 
Francis Marion, the “Swamp Fox,” held with his biographer in 1795, 
The emphatic reference to the Legislature shows that some attempt 
had been made in that body to establish free schools. ‘God preserve 
our Legislature from such penny wit and pound foolishness. What! 
Keep a nation in ignorance rather than vote a little of their own money 
for education! * * * We fought for self-government; and God hath 
pleased to give us one better calculated, perhaps, to protect our rights 
and foster our virtues and call forth our energies and advance our con- 
dition nearer to perfection and happiness, than any government that 
ever was framed under the sun. But what signifies this government, 
divine as it is, if it be not known and prized as it deserves? This is best 
done by free schools. 
“Men will always fight for their government according to their sense 
of its value. To value it aright they gnust understand it. This they 
cannot do without education. And, as a large portion of the citizens 
are poor, and can never attain that inestimable blessing without the 
aid of government, it is plainly the duty of government to bestow it 
freely upon them., The more perfect the government, the greater the 
duty to make it well known. Selfish and oppressive governments must 
‘hate the light and fear to come to it, because tneir deeds are evil.’ 
But a fair and cheap government, like our republic, ‘longs for the light]

and rejoices to come to the light, that it may be manifested to come 
from God,’ and well worthy of the vigilance and valor that an enlight- 
ened nation can rally for its defence. A good government can hardly 
ever be half anxious enough to give its citizens a thorough knowledge 
of its own excellences. For, as some of the most valuable truths, for 
lack of promulgation, have been lost, so the best government on earth, 
if not widely known and prized, may be subverted.” 
There are other evidences that there was a strong interest felt in the 
matter even among the great rank and file of the people. Although 
the daily papers of that time contained very little matter of any sort, 
and even less of a local nature, yet there is a complaint in the Charleston 
Courier of October 15, 1803, from a private correspondent, concerning 
the indifference to education shown by the editor of the paper. “We 
see great incomes made and great incomes wasted, great grandeur in 
equipage and household circumstances; * * * but we do not see 
the country studded up and down with those precious jewels of a state, 
Free Schools.” He regretted that everything hinged on polities; even 
the discussion on the yellow fever had taken a diplomatic turn, and we 
might expect to see the whole matter settled by a ruling of the State 
Department. Mr. Barnwell, a member of the Legislature, followed this 
in the next meeting of the Legislature with the introduction ofa bill “for 
establishing public schools in the several districts of the State.”! 
FREE SCHOOL ACT OF 1811. 
Matters continued thus until the act of 1811,? when the people took 
hold of the question. This act was recommended by Governor Henry 
Middleton in his message of November 26, 1811. On the following day 
Senator Strother presented petitions for free schools from citizens of 
Fairfield, Chester, Williamsburg, Darlington, Edgefield, Barnwell, York, 
Saint Stephen, Saint James, Santee, Saint John’s, Colleton, and Saint 
Peter’s. Hon. Stephen Elliott, of Charleston, was chairman of the 
joint committee, and to him belongs most of the honor of the measure. 
The bill drawn by him passed the Senate without a roll-call, and was 
adopted in the House by a vote of seventy-two to fifteen. “The act 
established in ‘each district and parish free schools equal in number to 
the representatives in the Lower House. Elementary instruction was 
to be imparted to all pupils free of charge, preference being given to poor 
orphans and the children of indigent parents. Three hundred dollars 
per annum were voted to each school. Commissioners varying in num- 
ber from three to eleven in each district and parish, serving without pay 
and without peualty, were intrusted with their management. Until a 
_ sufficient number of schools should be established, the commissioners 
were permitted to move the schools annually, but no school should be 
established until the neighborhood had built a school-house. The funds

  112 HIGHER EDUCATION IN SOUTH CAROLINA. 
of the free school might be united with the funds of the public schools. 
The aggregate appropriation was about $37,000 a year.” 
Two years after, in 1813, an attempt was made by a large minority 
to repeal the act, but it was saved through the efforts of one of Charles- 
ton’s Representatives. The people of Charleston, as a whole, have al. 
ways shown great willingness to uphold the State institutions. Wil- 
liam Crafts, Jr., made a ringing speech in support of the act, and in reply 
to the charge that the population was too sparse in some places to de- 
rive any benefit from it, said: “ This evil time will of itself remove, and 
what kind of inference is that which would abolish a general good to get 
rid of a partial evil?”! It was a fitting monument in after years to 
name one of the public school-houses of Charleston in honor of this 
gentleman. 
The number of schools established the first year was one hundred 
and twenty-three. In 1821 a pamphlet was issued at Columbia contain- 
ing an attack on the system.” 
Up to 1821, $302,490 had been expended by the State, of which at 
least one hundred thousand dollars had never been accounted for by 
the commissioners. In fact, the reports were so few that there were 
no checks at allon thesystem. It was probable that the commissioners 
and teachers had an understanding in the expenditure. Careless, ineffi- 
cient teachers were employed, and it was said that “in some of the lower 
districts they have actually converted the schools into gymnastic acad- 
emies, where, instead of studying philosophy in the woods and groves, 
as the Druids did of old, they take delight in the more athletic exercise 
of deer and rabbit hunting; and that it is a fine sight to see the long, 
lean, serpentine master * * * at his stand, * * * while the 
younger peripatetics are scouring the woods and hallooing up the game.” 
But the maiter of free schools still attracted attention ; legislative re- 
ports were almost annually made on the subject, and public men were 
deeply interested in the question. Nearly every Governor referred to 
it during his term in at least one of his messages. 
NEED OF A SUPERINTENDENT. 
George McDuffie used the following language in his message of 1835: 
“Jn no country is the necessity of popular education so often proclaimed, 
and in none are the schools of elementary instruction more deplorably 
neglected. They are entirely without organization, superintendence, or 
inspection of any kind, general or local, public or private.” Governor 
after Governor sent in a stirring message urging an improvement of the 
system. 
It is somewhat singular that nearly all the suggestions referred to the 
need of a central supervising head, corresponding to the present State ~ 
Superintendent. Even as far back as 1822, Governor Thomas Bennett

FREE SCHOOLS. 1138 
recommended the appointment of a “commissioner of the school fand,” 
and believed that this would realize the anticipated benefits of the 
“immense sums annually appropriated.” In 1838 a committee con- 
sisting of Rey. Stephen Elliott and James H. Thornwell was instructed 
to report to the Legislature after having conferred with the various 
commissioners. They incorporated in their report communications 
from the commissioners, the whole making a very interesting paper. 
A large part of it consists of the paper by Hon. Edmund Bellinger, 
of Barnwell, a graduate of South Carolina College in 1826, containing 
a great deal of information, historical, statistical, and otherwise. In the 
report of Messrs. Elliott and Thornwell, and in many of the commuis- 
cations from the commissioners, the need of a State Superintendent is 
strongly emphasized, and this is one of the suggestions formally made 
to the Legislature by the committee. The act itself, as pointed out by 
R. F. W. Alston in 1846, seemed to contempiate the appointment of 
such officer in the twelfth section, in providing for reports from the 
commissioners to ‘such person as the Legislature may direct.” Henry 
Summer, in a report to the Legislature in 1847, added another to the 
list of those favoring this suggestion. The report of the committee of 
the House of Representatives, to whom was referred the Governor’s 
message on the subject of free schools, concurred in this view. Finally 
Governor Manning, in 1853, rose to the highest conception of the whole 
question, and recommended the establishment of this central office, de- 
claring that the system “should not be an eleemosynary proffer, * * * 
but rather a fountain flowing for all, at which they may freely par- 
take.” 
But a great obstacle to the appointment of such officer came from the 
“combination schools.” The act allowed the commissioners to erect 
free schools entirely, or unite with schools already established. The 
teachers of such schools did not wish to have any authority over them. 
Yet in many such schools there was some good. ‘The teacher acted 
almost as the agent of a compulsory system. It was to his advantage 
to have as many pupils as possible, and he practically forced the 
children into the school. 
In spite of all the numerous suggestions, however, nothing of im- 
portance was done. In 1835) Judge Frost introduced an amendatory 
act, providing penalties for pon-performance of duty by the commis- 
sioners, but no one was designated to enforce the law. 
REPORT OF 1839. 
Others also urged the appointment of a supervising officer; among 
these were Thornwell and Elliott, who strongly recommended it in 
the report of 1839. The committee of the Legislature reported at this 
time that although deep interest had always been manifested by the 
Legislature, yet there seemed to be a general opinion all over the State 
11406—No. 83-—-8 
 
-P-A-G-E-122
  114 HIGHER EDUCATION IN SOUTH CAROLINA. 
that-the system was a failure. Messrs. Thornwell and Elliott rejected 
the Prussian system on account of the sparseness of the population, 
and the New York system on account of its cost, and also the “manual 
labor system,” since such schools had proved “egregious failures in 
almost every instance.” They recommended the establishment of a 
“teachers’ seminary,” and the increase of the appropriation to fifty 
thousand dollars. ‘They also showed how the original act was de- 
fective in apportioning the money according to representation in the 
Legislature, which was based on taxation and population. As a con- 
sequence, the richer a district the more schools it had, and the poorer 
the fewer it had. 
But Edmund Bellinger’s communication was the fullest. It brought 
out most clearly the defects of the system. Regular returns had been 
made in five years only, and in 1817 thirty-one of the whole forty-five 
failed to report. The amount spent bore no proportion to the scholars 
educated. In 1812 one dollar per scholar had been expended, but in 
4819 abont sixteen dollars per scholar. There was no regularity in the 
appropriation for a district. Barnwell County received one thousand 
one hundred and fifty-three dollars in 1825, and only seven hundred and 
twelve in 1826. Edgefield in 1818 received eleven dollars per scholar, 
but Laurens not quite two. The average attendance for the twenty- 
seven years was 6,018, while the average expenditure had been thirty- 
five thousand dollars. No wonder that one of the commissioners re- 
ported that “there is nothing systematic in the whole scheme but the 
annual appropriation for its support.” Even in this year of special re- 
ports only one-half of them had made returns. Out of the twenty-two 
whose reports are preserved, it is interesting to note that thirteen fa- 
vored the extension of the system to all children, and of the remaining 
nine only two or three were emphatic in restricting its operation to the 
poor children. As illustrating the feeling in the State, nearly all favored 
the study of the Bible, or other religious instruction, in the public 
schools. One was far in advance of the present even, in recommend- 
ing the study of the form of government of the State and the United 
States. These were suggestions that have not been acted on to this 
day. One believed in the efficacy of “manual labor” schools as a so- 
lution of the public school problem. It is interesting to note that an 
attempt is now being made in the State to establish an agricultural 
school. All lamented the ignorance and inefficiency of the average 
teaclier, and some strongly favored the establishment of a State nor- 
mal school; this has not yet been done, as a separate department. 
But the result of it all was “splendid nothings,” as Mr. Henry Sum- 
mer said in his report to the Legislature in 1847. So little had been 
done up to that time that this gentleman could incorporate in his report : 
“Tt was declared on the floor of this hall during the last session of this 
body that the free school system was a failure; and no one contradicted 
it; it seemed to be conceded by all,”.

  BREE SCHOOLS. 115 
R. F. W. Alston had made a report to the Agricultural Society in 
1846. Afterward, when he| was Governor, he emphasized the impor- 
tance of local taxation to supplement the State appropriation, even op: 
posing a larger appropriation unless the right of local taxation for sup- 
port of the schools was introduced. At last;in 1852, a forward step 
was taken in the increase of the appropriation to seventy-four thousand 
four hundred dollars, just double what it had been for forty years. This 
was only accomplished after a hard struggle, and a close vote in the 
Legislature. 
TER STATISTICS. 
In order to see the growth of these schools, some statistics of attend- 
ance may be helpful. In 1528, seventeen years after their first estab- 
lishment, there were 840 schools in the State, with 9,036 pupils. In 
1840 there were 563 schools with 12,526 pupils. In 1850 there were 724 
free schools with 17,838 pupils.! 
In 1860 there were 724 schools with 18,915 pupils, while the expendi- 
tures were $127,539.41. It is interesting to compare these figures with 
the approximate number of children of school age:

1860... 60, 000 18, 945, 
1880... 101, 000 61, 219 
Bua 
The figures for the number of pupils of school age, except for the 
last year, are calculated at something over twenty per cent., as Dr. 
Warren, the statistician of the Bureau of Education, thought that the 
school population between six and sixteen would be about twenty-one 
percent. The figures are for the whites all through, in order to preserve 
the same factor of comparison. The figures for 1880 are taken from 
the report of the State Superintendent of Education for 1886. From 
the above table one would be justified in calling the system a failure ; 
it was indeed openly denounced as a failure all over the State; and it 
was a failure as far as furnishing a general scheme of education for the 
masses. : 
REASONS FOR THE FAILURE OF THE SYSTEM. 
The favoring of paupers was probably the greatest cause of the fail- 
ure of the system. This was pointed out time and again by several, 
but the majority were opposéd to any change. “The wealthier and 
higher classes * * * will not avail themselves of the free schools. 
* * * The poorer citizens, * * * from pride and delicacy of

116 HIGHER EDUCATION IN SOUTH CAROLINA. 
feeling, will rather keep their children at home altogether than, by 
sending them to the free school, attach to them, as they think and feel, 
‘the stigma of being poor, and of receiving an education as paupers.” 
These words of Rev. Mr. Thrummell, of All-Saints, in 1839, express 
the feeling of both classes toward the system, though, but few of the 
prominent men or of the commissioners saw the trouble as clearly 
as this gentleman. Even Mr. Bellinger, who made so elaborate a re- 
port in this year, emphatically called for the restriction to the poorer 
classes. Rey. James H. Thornwell, one of the most gifted men of the 
State, was jnst as emphatic in limiting the fund to the poor, though he 
never proposed to limit the college to that class, although it was a State 
institution. This spirit was an outgrowth of the class distinction in the 
State, a perpetuation of the antagonisin of the two classes. The lower 
classes had sufficient pride to reject the proffer. 
But there is one redeeming feature in this sketch of the system; and 
that is the recognition by some clear-headed observers of the urgent 
need of a general system of schools for all, and not for the pauper classes 
alone. While in different parts of the State many had seen this, only 
the commissioners in Charleston had attempted to supply the deficiency. 
FREE SCHOOLS IN CHARLESTON. 
The commissioners in Charleston had seen the intent of the orig- 
inal act, and had set to work to carry it out. Public schools had sue- 
ceeded in Nashville and New Orleans, and why not in Charleston ? 
This is what Mr. Barnard pointed out when he had prepared a commu- 
nication on public schools at the request of Governor Alston, Mr. Me- 
Carter, and others. The schools in Charleston had followed the general 
course of the others in the State. Under the law, five houses had been 
erected and furnished by the teachers, on a salary of nine hundred dol- 
lars. The attendance had been, in 1812, 260; in 1818, about 300; in 
1823, about 320; in 1829, about 467; in 1834, about 525. 
- But the Charleston commissioners, especially C. G. Memminger, A. 
G. Magrath, and W. Jefferson Bennett, roused from their lethargy, 
and in the face of bitter prejudice revolutionized the system. They 
worked on a totally different plan. Their aim was to provide schools 
for all, and not for pauper pupils only. In 1855 they built a house on 
St. Philip’s Street, at a cost of twenty-five thousand dollars, to accom- 
modate eight hundred pupils. Three years later they erected another, 
on Friend Street, at a cost of thirty thousand dollars. A kind of nor- 
mal school for teachers was formed, to meet every Saturday, under the 
direction of the superintendent of public schools. They also built a 
high school for girls at a cost of twenty-five thousand dollars, of which 
the State paid ten thousand dollars and the citizens of Charleston the 
remainder. The expenses of its maintenance were ten thousand dollars 
annually, of which the city paid half, and the State guaranteed the 
   
-P-A-G-E-125
  
FREE SCHOOLS. : 117 4 
other half on condition of being permitted to send ninety pupils. A 
normal department was attached to this. 
The whole system was inaugurated with appropriate ceremonies on 
July 4, 1856, when Dr. 8S. H. Dickson delivered an address. It was 
modelled on the ‘‘ New York” plan, and the heads of the schools were 
brought from the North, so that teachers thoroughly acquainted with 
the system would direct the management. Miss Agnes K. Irving, an 
accomplished teacher from the Orphan Asylum on Randalls Island, was 
made principal of the Orphan House School. The native southern 
teachers were forced to take subordinate places at reduced salaries. In 
a short time the number of children in attendance was one thousand 
four hundred, and there were more applications than could be granted. 
In 1860 the attendance was four thousand.’ 
This was done in the face of strong opposition... “ Fair Play” openly 
charged that the change had been made in order that the new board 
might get the benefit of the “ spoils,” and claimed that they had over- 
stepped their limits in setting up common schools, when the act only 
called for free schools. He also called attention to the resolutions of 
the last session of the Legislature, which had “ re-announced the fact 
that the free schools are for the poor.” He concluded by confidently 
venturing the prediction “ that the new system, unsupported as it is by 
law, will not succeed.” But it did succeed, and according to a writer 
in Barnard’s Journal,’ “revolutionized public sentiment in that city, 
and was fast doing it for the whole State when the mad Peeeon of war 
consummated another revolution.” 
GRADUAL IMPROVEMENT IN THE SYSTEM. 
A gradual but slow improvement is evident in the working of the 
system. When first begun, no qualifications for teachers were required, 
except what each board might impose of its own will. In 1828 a certifi- 
cate of qualification signed by three persons in the vicinity was required, 
and in 1839 an examination by the commissioners in person. The ap- 
propriations had commenced with thirty-seven thousand dollars annu- 
ally, but in 1852 had been. increased to seventy-four thousand dollars. 
Aud, finally, the great success of the Charleston schools would seem to 
warrant one in believing that the system would have extended to the 
whole State in a few 's. Moreover, the reports of the years immedi- 
ately before the War show an increase in attendance. 
  SYSTEM SINCE THE WAR. 
During the War and up to 1868, nothing of importance was done in 
the schools. In that year a new Constitution was adopted, and the free 
schools were pene by the Dg schools. By this act of recon- 
    
    in Hac: Book, p. 462. : Vol. J XXIV, p. p. 317.

struction it was provided that a State Superintendent, elected bien 
nially, should have the general oversight of the whole system. It was 
also provided that a commissioner for each county, to be elected by 
popular vote, should have oversight, under the State Superintendent, 
_of the school matters of the county, while trustees under him were 
appointed for each school district. By this instrument the people ob- 
tained the central supervising officer that so many prominent men had 
wanted for half a century. 
Since the establishment of this excellent system the progress has 
been as fair as one could wish. That most efficient superintendent, H. 
S. Thompson, began to work in 1877 to disentangle the schools from 
the mass of debt and ignorance. He labored for six years, and gradu- 
ally built them up. On his elevation to the Governor’s chair in 1882, 
Col. Asbury Coward worthily filled his place until the election of Mr. 
J. H. Rice in 1886. The Superintendent from 1868 to 1876 was J. K. 
Jillson, From the last report of the Superintendent we may get some 
idea of the present condition of the public schools and the progress that 
has been made. 
The whole number of children of school age (six to sixteen), by the 
census of 1880, was 281,664; the total enrolmeut in the schools last 
year (1888) was 193,434. The average length of session is three and 
one half months; this is short, but it is as much as the taxes will sup- 
port, and the tax rate is as high as the average in New England. So 
they are doing as much as the people of that section. The number of 
schools is 3,922; teachers, 4,203. The average monthly compensation of 
teachers is, for males, $26.68 ; for females, $23.80. 
SOME OPPOSITION. 
It can not be denied that there is some opposition to the public 
schools in some retired places, and it is very justly charged that with 
their three months’ free tuition they have broken up the old academies, 
while not substituting anything for those excellent training institutions. 
Many openly declare for the abolishment of the public schools on this 
ground; but if they could be improved this opposition would cease. 
There is some opposition also on grounds of religion, but it is no 
stronger than in any other section. 
But a gratifying feature is the increase of the graded town schools, 
supported by local taxation. A constitutional amendment of 1876 had 
imposed a levy of two mills tax for school purposes, besides the poll tax. 
But this was found insufficient for the cities, and under the authority of 
an act so framed as to throw the matter into the hands of the property 
holders, several cities have a very improved system of graded schools. 
Some of them, especially in Charleston and Columbia, will compare 
favorably with those of any section of the country. 
Another encouraging feature is the organization of State normal in- 
stitutes each summer, one for white teachers and one for colored teach-

ers. These have been held annually since 1880, with one or two excep 
tions. So the outlook on the whole is very encouraging, and hopeful for 
the future. : 
PRESENT CONDITION OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
Superintendent J. H. Rice, in his last report (1888), presents a hope- 
ful view of the future of the public school system. His cheering words ’ 
give every assurance that opposition will eventually cease, and that the 
efficiency of the system will be advanced. 
He says: “There is an increase of 18,417 pupils in the enrolment of 
1888, * * * There is also an increase. of 14,036 in the average at- 
tendance, a most notable proportion. The last ten years have been a 
transition period in our educational work. The plans of private indi- 
viduals crumbled to pieces, and many have lamented the decay of schools 
once prosperous. But the State Legislature has been quietly and firmly 
laying the foundations for broader work. South Carolina * * * 
desires that the advantages once bounded by the horizon of private 
effort should be widely diffused through the power and benevolence of 
a great State. The free school has been pushed into every locality.” 
He points with pride to the fact that there were one hundred and 
sixty-two more schools on the list than the year before, and refers to 
the ambition of the small towns in the State to establish graded insti- 
tutions. ‘Winnsborough and Rock Hill have spent about twelve thou- 
sand dollars each on their school buildings. Greenville begins with 
eighteen thousand dollars and * * * Spartanburg levies a tax of 
twelve thousand dollars, with a special local tax for her schools. 
Smaller and larger towns, and country districts the State over, are rap- 
idly putting their money into modern school-houses.”! 
WINTHROP TRAINING SCHOOL. 
During the years of trial with the free school system, the inefficiency 
of the average teacher was pointed out repeatedly, and the establish- 
ment of a normal school was urged. This has never been founded, 
chiefly for want of means. But in the last two years, through the 
munificence of George Peabody and the energy of the efficient super- 
intendent of the schools of Columbia, facilities have been provided in 
the Winthrop Training School for training female teachers and thus 
largely meeting the demand. From a letter of John P. Thomas, Jr., 
in 1887, the following sketch of it is taken: 
“The Winthrop Training School was opened in Columbia on Novem- 
ber 15, 1886, in the buildings of the Theological Seminary, which 
have been temporarily secured for the use of the school. The school 
was organized under the general powers conferred by law upon the 
board of school commissioners of the city of Columbia. But the school

had not been in operation long before the idea was coneeived to enlarge 
its scope. With this view, application was made to the General As- 
sembly for a charter. Under the provisions of this charter the school 
will be operated for the benefit of the whole State. The school is named 
in honor of the venerable and philanthropic chairman of the Peabody 
board, and it is by the liberality of this board that the school is mainly 
supported. It has been in successful operation since its opening under 
the following corps: Prof. D. B. Johnson, superintendent; Miss M. H. 
Leonard, principal; Miss A. E. Bonham, practice teacher; Mrs. T. C. 
Robertson, teacher of drawing. 
“The school has been attended by twenty-one young ladies. The 
‘up-country,’ ‘low-country,’ and middle section of the State have all been 
represented, During the short time the school has been in session, the 
following work has been accomplished: the pupils have been taught the 
methods of the vartous classes in the city graded schools, and they 
have had the opportunity to observe, by personal inspection, the prac- 
tical working of these schools and their successful ways of management. 
In addition to this, each training pupil has had a week’s practice in the 
schooL-room, instructing and controlling children, under the direction 
of the practice teacher. 
“Their class work has included psychology, physiology, methods of 
teaching reading, arithmetic, Hnglish language, geography, history, 
penmanship, music, drawing, and calisthenics. Lessons on ‘forms and 
plants,’ as bearing on primary instruction, have been given. Theschool 
is open to all those in the State wishing to prepare themselves for the 
teaching profession.” 
The generous Legislature of 1887 again showed its public spirit by 
establishing thirty-four scholarships, one for each county, yielding one 
hundred and fifty dollars apiece. They are limited to those who have 
not the necessary means, and are chosen by competitive examination 
by the State Superintendent of Education. They may be held for a 
year, and the holders, on completion of the course, are required to teach 
for one year in the common schools of the counties from which they 
come. 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
In.addition to the Winthrop school, there are other facilities in the 
State for training teachers. 
There is a normal college, with a two years’ course, within the State 
University. The head of itis Dr. E. E, Sheib, of Baltimore, who studied 
for five years in Germany, and received the degree of doctor of philos- 
ophy in pedagogies at Leipsic. Previous to being called to Columbia, 
he was for several years president of the State Normal School of Lou- 
isiana. 
Claflin University, at Orangeburg, has also a normal course of three 
years. There is, in addition, a special teachers’ class every spring for

those who cannot take the full course. Five other institutions in the 
State also provide normal instruction for colored teachers, 
The Saturday Normal School at Charleston has a four years’ course 
of study, with free tuition. The teachers of Columbia hold monthly 
meetings for the study and investigation of the principles which under- 
lie their science. 
Besides these facilities, there are the State and county institutes, 
which continue for a few weeks during the summer, and are conducted 
by skilled and experienced teachers. Often there are educators from 
large cities, where their opportunities have made them acquainted with 
the most improved methods of teaching. These institutes are usually 
very largely attended. 
The State is also entitled to ten scholarships in the Peabody Normal 
School at Nashville. The recipients of this bounty are under obliga- 
tions to teach for a term of years in their native States after grad- 
uation, 
There are other means for pedagogical instruction less definite in 
character, though their influence cannot be doubted. The Carolina 
Teacher, a pedagogical monthly at Columbia, and the reading circles 
voluntarily formed among the teachers, probably reach more of those 
engaged in training youth than the normal schools and institutes can. 
PEABODY AND SLATER FUNDS. 
South Carolina has been greatly benefited by the appropriations 
from the Peabody and Slater Funds, but especially from the former. 
The awards of these philanthropical bequests have been devoted to 
the aid of the public, graded, and normal schools, teachers’ institutes, 
and for scholarships in the Peabody Normal School at Nashville, Tenn. 
South Carolina is entitled to ten of these scholarships, which are con- 
ferred after competitive examination, and yield the holders free tuition 
and two hundred dollars each per annum. It is now the settled policy 
of the trustees of the Peabody Fund to expend the greater portion of 
the income in assisting to train teachers. 
While the total amount received from the Peabody endowment is 
large, the advantage to the State cannot be measured in money. By 
means of these gifts a stimulus is furnished to local effort, and new 
and improved methods of teaching are introduced into places that 
would have known nothing of them but for the exertions of the General 
Agent. 
The present Superintendent of Education for the State, in fitting 
words, makes acknowledgment of the debt of gratitude for the noble 
munificence of George Peabody: “I need not again call attention to 
the beneficent results flowing from the annual bounty of the Peabody 
Fand. It is difficult for us to see how we should have begun our higher 
school work without this aid, and it is surely true that we would have 
been compelled to abandon our county institutes. * * * Peabody,

dead, yet lives, radiant in the grateful hearts of his countrymen, and, 
more valuable than all, sirined in the many humble homes where his 
charity has lighted the lamp of knowledge.”! 
The following amounts have been disbursed by the Peabody Fund 
in South Carolina for educational purposes: In 1868, $3,550; 1869, 
$7,800; 1870, $3,050; 1871, $2,500; 1872, $500; 1873, $1,500; 1874, 
$200; 1875, $100; 1876, $4,150; 1877, $4,300; 1878, $3,600; 1879, $4,- 
250; 1880, $2,700; 1881, $4,050; 1882, $5,375; 1883, $4,225; 1884, 
$4,400; 1885, $5,000; 1886, $5,000; 1887, 4,000; 1888, $8,000—making 
a total of $78,250? 
The Slater Fund has also distributed the following sums: In 1883, 
$2,000; 1884, $750; 1885, $3,500; 1886, $2,700—making a total of 
$8,950.°    
        
EDUCATION OF THE NEGRO. 
The education of the negro is so largely elementary that it more prop- 
erly falls under the subject of public schools than elsewhere. 
Slavery came in with the first settlers of the province, and the negroes 
increased rapidly in population, until, by the eighteenth century, they 
outnumbered the whites. Coming directly from Africa, they first had 
to learn the language, and embrace the Christian religion. 
The Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts was 
active in providing for their spiritual welfare. In 1705 the first mis- 
sionary, Rev. Samuel Thomas, reported that about twenty negro slaves 
regularly attended church in Goose Creek Parish, and others were able 
to speak and read the English language. The first systematic effort 
made for their education was said to be the establishment of a school 
in 1744 by Rev. Alexander Garden, the building of which cost £308 8s 
6d. This was perhaps for free negroes, of whom there were many 
throughout the State during the time of slavery who owned slaves 
themselves, and were as much affected by the results of the 9th of 
April, 1865, as the whites. This school was doubtless established by the 
Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, since it is 
stated in the Proceedings of the society for 1752, “that a flourishing 
negro schoo) was taught in Charleston by a negro of the society, under 
! Report of State Superintendent of Education for 1883, p. 18. 
2 All these figures, except for the last year, are taken from the Reports of the United 
States Commissioner of Education for 1885-86 and 1886-87. Those for 1888 are taken 
from the report of the State Superintendent of Education of South Carolina for that 
year. The amount for 1887 does not include the aid furnished by the Agent to pub- 
lic schools in the State. The last Report of the Commissioner of Education gives the 
sum total granted by the Peabody endowment for public schools in the ten States, but 
not the appropriation for each State. So the grand total would probably be several 
thousand dollars larger. 
’Report of the Commissioner of Education, 1885-86. There is no reference to this 
fund in the last Report, either of the United States Commissioner of Education, or of 
the State Superintendent of Education of South Carolina,

the inspection and direction of the worthy rector, Garden, by which 
means many poor negroes were taught to believe in God and in His 
son, Jesus Christ.”! 
This good work was further carried on by the religious training of 
the negroes, on every plantation and in every household. But the idea 
arose that it was dangerous to educate the slaves, and this was strength- 
ened by several insurrections, which, later, caused it to be forbidden by 
law to give the negro instruction in reading and writing. This act was 
passed in 1834, in spite of the earnest protests of many of the leading 
men of the State. But the God-fearing men and women, in defiance of 
the law and of public opinion, boldly taught some of their slaves to 
read, in order that they might know the way of life. A Baptist minis- 
ter was threatened with expulsion from his church, but he went on 
with his work and overcame local prejudice. _ 
But oral religious instruction went forward in every denomination, 
and ‘experiences ” of several hours’ length were reverently listened to by 
their devout, educated white brethren, who compared them with the 
visions of Ezekiel and Jeremiah. The two races sat under the same 
preacher aud received the sacrament from the same hands. The differ- 
ent churches made reports of one race as regularly as of the other. 
Special missionaries, some of them very prominent, were sent to labor 
among the blacks. Every large plantation had its own house of wor- 
ship for the slaves. The number of communicants, of marriages, of con- 
verts, of Sunday school scholars, of each race was reported regularly. 
Their condition, while not equal to that of the working classes in the 
North, ‘‘compared favorably with the lower classes in many countries 
of Europe, at least.” All the trades requiring skilled labor were in 
their hands, and during Reconstruction they suddenly became orators, 
parliamentarians, and statesmen. With the War came the upheayal, 
The schoolmaster followed the soldier, and in the track of the army of 
destruction were erected the temples of peaceful education. On the 
spot where the first slave set foot on southern soil, two hundred and 
forty-one years later, only five months after Sumter, was established 
the first negro school. As the northern soldiers pushed their way down 
the Mississippi and gained a foothold on the Atlantic and the Gulf, 
the agents and missionaries of the different churches followed. Among 
the different agencies none were more active than the American Mis- 
sionary Society, and the Freedmen’s Aid Society of the Methodist 
Wpiscopal Church. The Baptists also worked vigorously, and the Pres- 
byterians were not behindhand. In all, the amount sent by the beney- 
olence of the North to the negro in the South, up to the present time, 
is over twenty-six million dollars. 
The first places in South Carolina where negro schools were estab- 
lished were Saint Helena and Beaufort. Northern benevolence, large

and generous as were its gifts, could never hope to do more than es- 
tablish schools at widely distant points, and train a few who would be 
an example to the many. The general education of the masses had to 
be done by the people of the section, if ever done at all. On the reor- 
ganization of the State government in 1868 a public school system was 
provided, as far as the changed conditions would permit. The plan 
was thorough, but the administration during Reconstruction was ineffi- 
cient. But still the enrolment of the negroes increased from 8,163 in 
1870 to 103,334 in 1888.1 
But these schools give only the most elementary instruction, and can 
not give much of that, since the period of instruction lasts only about 
three months in a year. The State was so prostrated financially as to 
be unable to provide schools for advanced instruction, and these would 
probably not have been soon established without gifts from the North. 
The Baptists established Benedict Instittite at Columbia, for the educa- 
tion of ministers of the Gospel, and of teachers, male and female; the 
Northern Presbyterian Church founded Brainerd Institute in 1874 at 
Chester, as a normal school, and also the Fairfield Normal Institute at 
Winnsborough in 1869; the American Missionary Society established 
Avery Normal Institute in Charleston on the 1st of October, 1865; the 
Freedmen’s Aid Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church North pur- 
chased the buildings of the Orangeburg Female College in 1869, and 
opened Claflin University ; the African Methodist Episcopal Church or- 
ganized Allen University at Columbia in 1881; while warm friends at 
the North established other schools, such as the Schofield at Aiken, 
and the Shaw Memorial School in Charleston. None of these, of course, 
could have a very advanced collegiate course, and most of them do not 
aspire to it, but are contented to give good high school training. One 
of them, however, does furnish a grade of instruction almost equal to 
that of any white college in the State. 
CLAFLIN UNIVERSITY. 
In 1869 the buildings of the Orangeburg Female College (white) were 
bought by Rev. A. Webster, D. D., and 'T. Willard Lewis. A charter 
was obtained from the Legislature on December 18, 1869, and the in- 
stitution was named in honor of ‘Hon. Lee Claflin, of Boston, Mass. It 
has been largely through his aid and that of his son, the Hon. William 
Claflin, that the University has reached its present efficient state. The 
body of trustees, as provided in the charter, could never be less than 
seven nor more than twenty-one, and was to be self-elective. Section 
five of the instrument contained this provision: ‘ No instructor in said 
University shall ever be required by the trustees to have any particular 
complexion or profess any particular religious opinions as a test of 
office, and no student shall be refused admission to or denied any of the 
1 Report of State Superintendent of Education, 1888, p. 43.

privileges, honors, or degrees of said University, on account of race, 
complexion, or religious opinions which he may entertain: Provided, 
nevertheless, That this section, in reference only to religious opinions, 
shall not apply to the theological department of said University.” 
The University was opened with a president and three assistants, be- 
sides several teachers in the primary department; the attendance the 
first year was three hundred and nine. In 1872, under the educational 
act of Congress, the State College of Agriculture and Mechanics’ In- 
stitute was located at Orangeburg in connection with Claflin Univer- 
sity, and a farm of one hundred and sixteen acres was provided. In 
1876 the buildings, library, ete., were unfortunately burned, but they 
were soon replaced by structures of brick. On the change of party in 
1877, the Agricultural College was made a branch of the State Uni- 
versity, and was retained: at Orangeburg in connection with Claflin 
University. The expenses are met in part by an income of $5,800 from 
productive funds of the value of $95,750,! portion of the Congressional 
land grant. Other assistance is given by the Slater and Peabody 
Funds, and by the Methodist Episcopal Church. 
The departments of the University have been gradually increased. 
In 1877 the normal department was added, and shortly after this the 
grammar school, preparatory to the normal department, was estab- 
lished. The mechanical department, sustained by the Slater Fund, 
and the Girls’ Industrial Home were soon provided, and good indus- 
trial training is furnished. A course in science and agriculture was in- 
stituted, and instruction in the latter is also practical. 
As was to be expected from the condition of the race, the classical 
department is not very fully attended, there having been only eigh- 
teen students in 1886. But the work is of a high grade and thorough. 
For admission, plane geometry, Cesar, Roman history, Greek grammar 
and history, and the Anabasis are required. The course covers four 
years. Latin and Greek are each studied three years; mathematics goes 
through conic sections, surveying, and mechanics. The other usual 
collegiate studies are included. The faculty now includes a president 
and thirteen assistants, and the attendance in 1886 reached four hund- 
red and ten, all but two being from South Carolina. Both sexes are 
admitted, but there are no white students in the institution. The num- 
ber of graduates reached fifty-three, of whom eleven were in the college 
proper and the remainder in the normal course. The expenses are mar- 
vellously low, being only about fifty dollars for the entire school year. 
The Charleston News and Courier, the largest paper in the State, 
sent a staff correspondent to attend the commencement exercises in 
1888, and gave four.and a half columns to the report. The next day a 
column editorial was devoted to the University, in which it was said : 
“Claflin University is truthfully designated as the model University of 
the South for colored people. * * * There were ten thousand persons   
1 Report of the Commissioner of Education, 1884-85, p, 628,

126 HIGHER EDUCATION IN SOUTH CAROLINA. 
at the commencement exercises. The University has seventeen teach- 
ers, fourteen superintendents, and nine hundred and forty-six students. 
It exceeds in size the famous school at Hampton, Va. More than five 
hundred students actually pay for their own education by the work of 
their hands. In the curriculum are six courses of study, with instruction 
in nine different industries, represented by the nine special schools of 
agriculture, carpentry and cabinet-making, printing, tailoring, shoe- 
making, painting and graining, blacksmithing, merchandising, and 
domestic economy. The University was founded by Mr. Claflin, of 
Boston, but it is upheld by South Carolina, which gives it both finan- 
cial assistance and moral support.” 
Dr. Atticus G. Haygood, who delivered the address, said that it was 
the largest University between the Potomac and the Rio Grande, and 
the least expensive. 
ALLEN UNIVERSITY. 
This is chiefly controlled and managed by the negroes, and it is very 
interesting to note the high aim they have set in their efforts to educate 
themselves. The aim, asset forth by the Right Rev. W. I’. Dickerson, 
is as follows: “To aid in the development of the highest type of Chris- 
tian manhood; to prove the negro’s ability to inaugurate and manage a 
large interest; * * * to train them not only for the pulpit, the bar, 
the sick room, and school-room, but for intellectual agriculturists, me- 
chanics, and artisans; * * * to educate, in the fullest sense of that 
comprehensive word, is the work, mission, and cause for the establish- 
ment of Allen University.”! 
The race has had to receive its instruction from the whites, so far, 
But as they are educated, they demand the places for the blacks, and 
very probably they will ina few years be trained by colored teachers 
alone. In Charleston nearly all the teachers in the colored public 
schools are white, and in the schools maintained there by northern 
charity the instructors are also of that race. In Allen University, on 
the other hand, the work is done by colored teachers.

CHAPTER VII. 
SOUTH CAROLINA COLLEGE. 
ECONOMIC BASIS FOR THE SOUTH CAROLINA COLLEGE. 
‘ 
Deeper down than sentiment or philanthropy or patriotism, lies the 
very important work of the financier, the providing of an economic basis 
for a great undertaking. The difficulties to be overcome in gathering 
funds to found an educational institution in South Carolina in the first 
years of this century were very great. The State had emerged from a 
bloody destructive civil war less than a quarter of a century before. 
The country was covered chiefly with tangled forests, and the popula- 
tion was widely scattered. There was no want, neither was there any 
accumulated wealth. The inhabitants were of two different classes, and 
there was a sharp line of distinction between the “up-country” and 
“Jow-country ” people. 
In every movement for extending the scope of government, no matter 
how apparent may be the advantages, there is a small number of people 
in opposition, either from innate conservatism or constitutional obsti- 
nacy. Even at this day, after the blessings of public schools are almost 
universally acknowledged, we find men of intelligence declaring against 
the system. he opposition of the conservatives was much more for- 
midable in early times than now. ‘This small party usually bases its po- 
sition on the question of expense, and their case in South Carolina was 
a very strong one from this standpoint. The treasury was in an impov- 
erished condition, and a storm had lately devastated the sea-coast. 
With such a condition of affairs, it required a clear-headed financier 
to furnish the means necessary to found a State college, while not pre- 
senting too weak a position for the discontented party to attack. 
South Carolina College found such a friend in the person of one of her 
public men. The importance of his services in laying the financial 
foundation of this institution demands a sketch of his useful life. 
PAUL HAMILTON. 
He was descended from a line of Paul Hamiltons, his great-grand- 
father, grandfather, and uncle having borne that name. 
The novelist and historian, William Gilmore Simms, says, “he was the 
friend and counsellor of Isaac Hayne, the martyr of the Revolution, and 
himself a Revolutionary personage of great influence.” 
127 
   
-P-A-G-E-138
  
128 HIGHER EDUCATION IN SOUTH CAROLINA. 
His paternal Scotch and maternal English ancestry combined to make 
him a strong character. He was born at Wiltown, in Saint Paul’s Parish, 
South Carolina, on the 16th day of October, 1762. His father, Archi- 
bald Hamilton, died when Paul was an infant, leaving him to the tender 
care and training of hismother. Her maiden name was Rebecca Brand- 
ford. His maternal grandmother was a Miss Cresswell, of North Caro- 
lina, whose relatives were, and still are, among the most respectable 
citizens of that State. 
Although imbued with a deep reverence for sacred things, he was not 
a morbid Christian; but in his youth and all through manhood was 
fond of society. At school he was one of the most athletic boys of his 
age. Inrunning and jumping he outdid all his comrades, and he also had 
an excellent reputation as a boxer. Dancing and hunting were also 
among his favorite pastimes. Directly after leaving school the pleas- 
ures of deer-hunting attracted him, and he spent the most of his time in 
the chase, and became one of the best riders in the country. That ex- 
perience as a rider proved, not long afterward, of incalculable service 
to him. 
His educational advantages were very limited, but were the best that 
could be obtained in his State in that primitive day. His mother taught 
him his letters, after which he was sent to aschool “ kept by a pert 
young Irishman named Ware, who was well qualified to bring on 
young children in reading and spelling.” At this, his first school, he 
surprised and delighted his friends by reading well a chapter from the 
Bible when he was only six years old. 
Next, he entered the principal school in Charleston, taught by one 
Alexander Alexander, where he also distinguished himself as a reader ; 
from the very first day he was placed at the head of a class of thirteen 
boys, of whom he was the youngest aud the smallest. He was gifted 
with a most remarkable memory, which was sadly perverted at that ill- 
regulated school, where the master simply used it as a means of exhibit- 
ing his proficiency in the classics. He had him translating Virgil’s 
Mneid when he knew nothing of the application of the simplest rules 
of syntax. He was allowed to use an English translation in the prepa- 
ration of the lesson, and at recitation to close the book and repeat the 
translation from memory. 
A little arithmetic, reading, spelling, and, on Fridays, catechisin 
were added to his course, and at fourteen years of age he began the 
study of Greek. 
At this time, 1776, South Carolina was invaded by the British, who, 
under Sir Henry Clinton and Admiral Parker, threatened an attack on 
Charleston. Then the services of every man, even schoolmasters, were 
required, so the schools were all disbanded, and Paul Hamilton’s mother 
recalled him to his country home. He had then the reputation of being 
a boy of great attainments and most promising genius. 
There was one teacher, James Hamden Thomson, in Charleston, who 
   
-P-A-G-E-139

was physically unfitted for military service. At the time of the inva- 
sion of South Carolina he retired with his pupils to a small village 
twenty miles away, and continued teaching. Prior to 1775 he had been 
a teacher of reputation in Princeton College. Hamilton’s mother placed 
him under Thomson’s instruction, with whom he made rapid progress 
in his classical studies, and also took up geometry, trigonometry, and 
book-keeping. At this school he showed his strength of character. 
His entrance examination proved him to be totally ignorant of grammar, 
and caused him to be placed with boys very much younger than himself; 
this so mortified him that, with characteristic pluck, he applied himself 
to his studies by day and night, until in a short time he far outshone 
every other pupil in the school. It would have been fortunate for him 
if all the time spent at Alexander's sham school had been passed under 
Thomson’s thorough instruction. 
Hamilton had chosen medicine as his future profession; but his 
guardian thwarted the plan, and suddenly removed him from school, 
when he was but sixteen years of age, much against his will, and the 
judgment of his mother and teacher. 
In a short time after leaving school he shouldered his musket, and 
although but a boy, at once proved himself an intrepid patriot and sol- 
dier. With an enthusiastic hatred for the British, and full of faith in 
the justice of the American cause, hé joined the “ Wiltown Hunters,” 
the first militia company raised in his neighborhood. His first experi- 
ence in battle was in an attack on a party of the enemy who were re- 
treating southward by water, in which he was exposed to a heavy can- 
nonade from their galleys. When over two hundred regulars broke and 
fled from the fire of the enemy, and a cannon shot cut off a small tree 
within three feet of his person, and, in a few seconds after, a charge of 
grape shot took down on his right hand about twenty stalks of corn, 
sending the shattered bits all about him, he firmly stood his ground, and 
was among the last to leave the field. 
On this occasion his bravery was publicly commended by Major 
Moore of North Carolina, who congratulated Hamilton’s commander on 
“the bravery of his little fellow.” The same bravery characterized him 
through many bloody skirmishes, where he was exposed to great peril 
of life, and where many times he made miraculous escapes. 
In the two sieges of Savannah he partook of all the dangers, and ulti- 
mately shared in the defeat. He was in the thickest of the fight at the 
attack on Charleston. He served as a volunteer under the Baron De 
Kalb until the 16th of August, 1780, when General Gates superseded 
De Kalb, and being re-enforced by bodies of militia, gave battle to the 
British army at Camden under Lord Cornwallis. In the defeat which 
followed Hamilton was among the numerous flying troops, and had sev- 
eral hard runs, with the British dragoons in pursuit. His skill as a 
rider was thoroughly tested on the above occasion, when the Ameri- 
cans were pursued for twenty-one miles from the battle-field.

Upon the reorganization of the army he returned to his own State 
with General Sumter, and participated in the campaigns of 1781 and 
1782, serving with distinction, principally with General Marion, on 
whose staff he served for several months. He participated in the 
crowning victory of Eutaw Springs, in September, 1781. 
During the period of rest, after the battle of Eutaw Springs, he re- 
turned to Wiltown, and laid siege to the hand of Mary Wilkinson. 
Here he suffered no defeat, for she surrendered to him, and, as he 
quaintly expressed it in his Memoir, “The 10th day of October, 1782, 
united me to Mary; she then turned of eighteen, and I short by six 
days of twenty.” 
After the Revolutionary struggle was over, he laid aside the duties 
of the soldier, and assumed those of the citizen. 
To the restoration of his private affairs and the rehabilitation of the 
broken fortunes of his people he now devoted himself assiduously. 
The close of the war entailed its duties and trials. The country was 
almost ruined and society was stirred to its very foundations. The 
accumulated wealth of a century of colonial labor and industry had 
been destroyed. The conditions through which the people of the 
State had passed are well described by the greatest of American 
historians in the following language: 
“South Carolina moved onward to independence through the bitter- 
est afflictions of civil war. Armies were encouraged by the govern- 
ment of England to pillage and lay waste her plantations, and con- 
fiseate the property of the greatest part of her inhabitants. Families 
were divided; patriots outlawed and savagely assassinated; houses 
burned, and women and children driven shelterless into the forests; 
districts so desolated that they seemed the abode only of orphans and 
widows; and the retaliation provoked by the unrelenting rancor of 
loyalists threatened the extermination of her people. Left mainly to 
her own resources, it was through bloodshed and devastation and the 
depths of wretchedness that her citizens were to bring her back to 
her place in the republic by their own heroic courage and self-devo- 
tion, having suffered more, and dared more, and achieved more than 
the men of any other State.”! 
in 1785 his public career began, being then appointed general tax 
collector of Saint Paul’s Parish. In the year after he was re-appointed 
collector, and also justice of the peace. In 1787 he served in the con- 
vention which adopted the Federal Constitution, and also in 1790 in the 
convention which framed the Constitution of his own State. 
In 1787 he was elected to the House of Representatives and served 
the two succeeding sessions, and, although urged to do so, declined to 
be a candidate the next time. 
Early in 1790 he moved from Saint Paul’s to Saint Bartholomew’s 
Parish. In 1794 he was almost unanimously elected Senator, and was 
re-elected in 1798.

In 1799 he was engaged in one of the most exciting questions that 
ever occupied the attention of his State Legislature,—the forming of its 
judiciary system. He was one of a committee to meet the other House 
on a reform measure, the result of which was the present admirable 
judiciary system of South Carolina. 
As his State’s financier he proved himself brilliant, bearing the weight 
of the fiscal affairs of the Senate, as chairman of its committee on pub- 
lic accounts, for three years. In that position he was recognized as 
having built up the finances of the State, which were known to have 
been in the greatest confusion. 
His next public position was that of Comptroller of the Treasury, to 
which office he was twice re-elected without opposition. 
Being overtaxed, he announced his intention of retiring to private 
life, but his legislative friends said, ‘We can not.yet spare you from 
public service, and you must give us two more years, at least, of your 
time as our next Governor.” 
On the 10th day of December, 1804, he was elected to the highest 
political office in the gift of his State, and discharged its dutios with 
great credit to himself and benefit to his fellow-citizens. 
The following quotation from Ramsay, the first aud most authorita- 
tive historian of the State, shows very clearly how much the South 
Carolina College was indebted to Paul Hamilton for its economic foun- 
dation : 
«The concentration of all matters relative to revenue in a head of the 
department had been several times proposed, but not adopted. Some 
could not see the utility of such an officer; others thought his salary 
might be saved. At length the defects of the financial system became 
so glaring as to induce the passing of an act in the year 1799 to estab- 
lish the office of a comptroller of the revenue, whose duty it was, among 
other ofiicial details, to superintend, adjust, and settle all the former 
accounts of the treasurers and tax-collectors of the State—to superin- 
tend the collection of the future revenue—to direct and superintend 
prosecutions for all delinquencies of revenue oflicers—to enforce execu- 
tions issued for arrearages of taxes, and suits for debts due tothe State— 
to decide on the official form of all papers to be issued for collecting the 
public revenue, and on the manner and form of keeping public accounts— 
to examine and count over the cash in the treasury—to prepare and re- 
port at every session of the Legislature estimates of the public revenue 
and public expenditure—and at the same time to render fair and ac- 
curate copies of all the treasurer’s monthly reports, and a true and ae- 
curate account of the actual state of each department of the treasury— 
to suspend from office every tax-collector who did not perform the du- 
ties of his oflice faithfully—to examine and compare the returns of tax- 
able property from the different districts—to inquire into any defects 
or omissions—and to proceed against all persons accessory to the mak- 
ing false or defective returns.

“Tt was also made the duty of the treasurers, on receiving any public 
money, to give duplicate receipts ; one of which was to be lodged with 
the comptroller. And no public money was to be paid otherwise than 
in conformity to legal appropriations; and no sum for more than $100 
was to be drawn out of the treasury but by the warrant of the comp- 
troller, expressing on what account such money was due by the State. 
Thus everything relating to revenue was subjected to the direction and 
control of a single person; and all power relative to the same concen- 
tred in his hands. The Legislature chose Paul Hamilton their first 
comptroller, who, besides an accurate knowledge of accounts, possessed 
a clear and systemizing head and a quick discernment to detect errors 
and frauds. After a thorough examination of the resources, debts, and 
credits of the State, he made his first report in 1800; and a further one 
annually for the four following years.. These reports astonished the 
Legislature. They then for the first time knew their real fiscal state, 
and were agreeably surprised to find it much better than they ex- 
‘pected. From Comptroller Hamilton’s last report in 1804 it appeared 
that the balance due to the State amounted to the unexpected sum of 
$754,755, 
“This flourishing condition of the public finances led to two important 
state measures. The richness of the treasury encouraged the Legisla- 
ture to subscribe three hundred thousand dollars in stock to the State 
bank, and to establish and endow the South Carolina college at the new 
central seat of government. The clear gains of the former, which accrued 
to the State from the excess of bank dividends over interest on six per 
cent. stock, were sufficient to defray the expenses of the latter. The 
State may be said to have acquired for its citizens the advantages of 
both institutions for nothing, as they were carried into effect without 
imposing upon them any additional burdens. After jive years’ faithful 
service, in which Paul Hamilton introduced the same order into the 
finances of the State which had been done by his illustrious namesake 
for the United States, he was honored by his grateful country with the 
highest State office in its gift.”! 
His executive and administrative talents were of such high order 
that he was promoted from the field of State politics to that of the Fed- 
eral Government. In 1809 he was invited by James Madison to a seat 
in his Cabinet, and the high estimation in which the President held 
him is seen in the following letter to him upon his resignation as Sec- 
retary of the Navy: : 
“ WASHINGTON, December 31, 1812. 
“DEAR Sir: I have received your letter of yesterday signifying your 
purpose to retire from the Department which has been under your 
care. :

us, I can not satisfy my own feelings or the tribute due to your patriotice

merits and private virtues, without bearing testimony to the faithful 
zeal, the uniform exertions, and unimpeachable integrity with which you 
have discharged thatimportant trust, and without expressing the value I 
have always placed on that personal intercourse, the pleasure of which I 
am now to lose. With these recollections and impressions, I tender you 
assurances of my affectionate esteem, and my sincere wishes for your 
welfare and happiness. 
“JAMES MADISON. 
“To PAUL HAMILTON, ESQ., 
“Secretary of the Navy.” 
After his resignation he returned to South Carolina and devoted him- 
self to the improvement of his estate. He died of country fever, on his 
plantation, June 30, 1816, when still comparatively a young man, and 
in the full possession of all his faculties. He was buried at Whale 
3ranch plantation, near Beaufort, S.C. His grave has been enclosed 
with an iron railing, by the order of the Navy Department, since the 
late Civil War.! 
NEED OF A COLLEGE. 
As seen before, the colleges founded by the State had all failed as 
colleges. Charleston College was the only one with any pretence to 
such title, and it was pronounced by Governor Drayton, in 1801, as 
“not entitled to a higher appellation than that of a respectable academy 
or grammar school.”? 
Not only was a college needed for the purposes of education, but for 
uniting the two sections of the State. In the words of a present pro- 
fessor in the State University, “South Carolina is practically the off- 
spring of two distinct streams of settlers, the one flowing over the lower 
country between the years 1670 and 1750, the other settling the country 
above Columbia, but not beginning till about 1750.”* A feeling of an- 
tagonism grew up between the two sections. 
The lower section had the weaith and the educated men, chiefly 
trained in Europe; the upper had the population, with slowly increas- 
ing wealth, and the people of this section began to demand a share in 
the government. By the Constitution of 1791 they had not received 
their proportion of representatives, but they had never ceased their de- 
mands. The lower country was fearful of intrusting the management 
of affairs to an uneducated people, and wisely concluded that it was 
' One of his sons, Lieutenant Archibald Hamilton, was killed on board the ‘‘ Presi- 
dent” in the engagement between that vessel and the British fleet off the shores of 
Long Island, January 15, 1815, after the treaty of peace between Great Britain and 
the United States had been signed by the commissioners of the respective countries. 
It isa singular coincidence that three of his great-grandsons, Captains Paul Ham- 
ilton, Paul Hamilton Seabrook, and Paul Hamilton Waring, all bearing his name, 
should have fallen in the late Civil War between the States.

best to afford the means of improvement, until they were fitted to as- 
r sume control. : 
The first steps toward this had been made at the founding of Mount 
Zion Society in 1777. This was done in Charleston, chiefly by men of 
wealth and public spirit in that city. The school was to be located one 
hundred and fifty miles from them, in the northern part of the State. 
The preamble of the act declares :' “ Our country cails, nay, the voice 
of reason cries aloud to us to promote knowledge as the firmest cement 
of a State; and conscience insists that it is our indispensable duty to 
instruct the ignorant in the principles of Christianity.” This sentiment 
recognizes the feeling between the two sections. 
FOUNDING OF THE COLLEGE. 
All this strongly pointed out the necessity»of a college, and to Goy- 
ernor Drayton belongs the credit of beginning the movement for its 
establishment. Unfortunately: the records ‘are very meagre as to the 
founding of the institution. The newspapers of the time give no local 
news at all, and very little of any sort, but consist chiefly of short edi- 
torials on politics. Governor Drayton in his message of November 23, 
1801, recommended the measure for the establishment of a college at 
Jolumbia. He called attention to the failure of the five colleges already 
incorporated by the Legislature, some of which existed only in name, 
and the others were no better than grammar schools. In the Legisla- 
ture Chancellor De Saussure deserves'the most honor. There was some 
sharp opposition, even from the upper eonntry, for whose benefit the 
act was very largely intended. This opposition continued for some time 
afterward, as the following year two petitions for the repeal of the act 
were received “from many inhabitants” of an up-country district, and 
even yet some dissatisfaction is manifested. 
The committee recommending the passage of the bill was composed 
of Thomas R. Smith, Col. W. B. Mitchell, Colonel Mays, Mr. Horry, 
Thomas Smith, Colonel Kershaw, Mr. Bennett, General Anderson, and 
Mr. De Saussure. The bill was entitled: “An act to establish a college 
at Columbia.” The preamble sets forth clearly the object of the bill, 
and reads: “ Whereas, the proper education of youth contributes greatly 
to the prosperity of society, and ought always to be an object of legisla- 
tive attention; and whereas, the establishment of a college in a central 
part of the State, where all its youth may be educated, will highly pro- 
mote the instruction, the good order, and the harmony of the whole 
community.” The act provided for thirteen trustees elected by the Leg- 
islature every four years, and for several of the State officers to be trus- 
tees ex officio; they were to report to the Legislature annually. The 
sum of fifty thousand dollars was appropriated for a building, and six 
thousand dollars annually for current expenses. The last section pro- 
. vided that the college should be located at Columbik

The act was ratified December 19, 1801, and the triistees organized 
and began the work of choosing a site and electing professors.! They 
“selected a beautiful eminence to the south-east of the city, commanding 
_a view of the country for many miles around, * * * affording to 
the north and west a prospect of the capital of South Carolina, one 
of the finest villages in America, with a population of three or four 
thougand inhabitants, and as refined a society as our country affords, 
and overlooking to the south an immense forest of twenty or thirty 
miles in extent, and now and then interspersed in the uniformity of its 
appearance by some great cotton field that stretches itself along the 
immense plains through which the Congaree winds its way between its 
willowy banks.” } 
INFLUENCE OF THE COLLEGE. 
As the college. was founded largely to unify the State, it was very 
satisfactory to know that the result was attained. Students came in from 
every section, and in a few years nearly every county was represented. 
Of hardly another college in the State can such a thing be said, South 
Jarolina College was founded as a State institution, and this purpose 
has been kept in view very clearly by the trustees ever since. 
In order to get the appropriation for the reorganization in 1880-82, 
some of its friends urged the advantages of northern patronage, and 
possibly some votes were influenced by this. But such patronage never 
came, and very few students have attended from other States. But 
inside the State it has by far the widest clientage. While the other 
colleges are limited to the denominations that support them, it has 
drawn its students from all denominations. In the session of 1835-86, 
Presbyterians, Methodists, Episcopalians, Baptists, Lutherans, Catho- 
lics, Jews, and those adhering to no church were all represented, in the 
above order of their respective numbers. In this same session thirty 
out of the thirty-four counties were represented. 
But it is especially in the great work of uniting the sections that its 
good results have been so clearly shown, while its benefits to the State 
have not been less clear. Gov. J. P. Richardson, who was instru- 
mental in founding the Citadel Academy, in his message of 1842 de- 
clared that “the attainments of a single class, the acquirements of one 
only of its ripe scholars, the fruit of a single one of those great minds 
whose energies it has developed, would not only compensate for all 
the patronage which has been extended to it, but is immeasurably 
more valuable to the State than the results of all her other benefactions 
to advance the progress of education.” Gov. J. H. Adams, fourteen 
years later, agreed exactly with Richardson. At the celebration of the 
semi-centennial of the college in 1854, one of its most distinguished 
graduates, James L. Petigru, said: ‘ As to the past, there is much ground

for gratulation in the effect which this college has had in harmonizing 
and uniting the State. In 1804 sectional jealousies were sharpened to 
bitterness, and there was as little unity of feeling between the upper 
and lower country as between any rival States of the Union.” And only 
a few years ago, in 1885, at the Citadel Academy, Gen. Ellison Capers 
defended the Academy, because “ with the university at Columbia it is 
a unifying agency uniting our people.” Under the logic of events this 
hardly seems necessary any longer, but in early times it was an impor- 
tant factor in the development of the country. The State was organ- 
ically divided, having two treasuries, and the feeling was carried into 
polities. 
Another fact was, it helped to weaken sectarian feeling, as was pointed 
out by President J. H. Thornwell, in his letter in 1853. Traces of this 
feeling still appear in the apportionment of the State offices. 
In the opinion of W. J. Rivers, who became professor in 1856, the 
college was chiefly useful in raising the standard of the academies, de- 
veloping a high sense of honor among the students, and inspiring an ap- 
preciation of literary and scientific attainments among a people largely 
agricultural. 
The college enjoyed a reputation equal to that of the famous Univer- 
sity of Virginia in developing a high sense of honor among the stu- 
dents. The boys were turbulent, defiant, and at times revolutionary, 
but they would not cheat in examination, or take a mean advantage of 
professor or student. By tacit understanding, they ostracised any of 
their number who so degraded themselves. 
ORGANIZATION AND OPENING OF THE COLLEGE. 
The trustees set earnestly to work, and erected the building for the 
college and a house for the president. They fixed the latter’s salary at 
two thousand five hundred dollars per annum, and that of the profes- 
sors of mathematics and natural philosophy at one thousand five hun- 
dred dollars each, while the others were to receive only one thousand 
dollars each. A president and three professors were elected,—a pro- 
fessor of mathematics and natural philosophy, a first and a second pro- 
fessor of languages. The first and third resigned, and the college 
opened January 10, 1804, with a faculty of two. 
The first person to matriculate was William Harper, who afterward 
became very eminent at the bar of the State. The number for the en- 
tire session was only forty-six. The places of the two professors who 
resigned were filled during the year. 
JONATHAN MAXCY. 
The president was a man of prominence and ability. If early success 
in life is taken as a standard of one’s greatness, then Jonathan Maxey 
ean lay claim to it as well as any man. He was born in 1768, and came

from a good Massachusetts family, his grandfather having been a mem- 
ber of the Colonial Legislature. At the age of fifteen he entered Brown 
University, where he distinguished himsélf by carrying off the highest 
honors on graduation. He was made tutor in the college, and then en- 
tered the Baptist ministry, but was finally elected president of his alma 
mater at the age of twenty-four. His administration of Brown Uni- 
versity was highly successful, and in 1802 he became president of Union 
College, and finally, in 1804, of the South Carolina College, which posi- 
tion he occupied until his death, in 1820. 
Tle was not a man of great scholarship, but had executive abilities of 
no mean order. He was successful in building up the young institution, 
the third to which he had been called. He was in conflict at one time 
with the board of trustees, and subsequently a resolution of censure 
was passed on him. But he defended himself with so much skill that 
the whole matter was dropped. He was progressive and energetic, and 
enlarged the course of study of the college. He made recommendation 
for the study of chemistry, and asked for an appropriation to this effect. 
He advised the addition of a law course, but the plan was not executed 
until the close of the Civil War. 
COURSE OF STUDY. 
The courses of study were fixed by the board of trustees at an early 
date after the organization of the college. It is not to be supposed : 
that this course was inflexibly followed, since there is proof given by 
the reports of the presidents showing that it was not strictly adhered 
to. But it is of value as showing the high aims of the young school. 
The whole course comprised four years. The following curriculum, 
taken from the official records, shows the aims of the college: 
“Src. 1. There shall be established in the college four classes, which 
in their succession shall bear the usual titles of Freshman, Sophomore, 
Junior, and Senior. 
“Sro. 2. For admission to the Freshman class a candidate shall be 
able to render from Latin into English, Cornelius Nepos, Sallust, Czesar’s 
Commentaries, and Virgil’s neid; to make grammatical Latin of the 
exercises in Mair’s Introduction ; to translate into English any passage 
from the Evangelist St. John, in the Greek Testament; to, give a gram- 
matical analysis of the words, and have a general knowledge of the 
English grammar; write a good, legible hand, spell correctly, and be 
well acquainted with arithmetic as far as includes the rule of proportion. 
“Src. 3. Candidates for admission to any of the higher classes, in 
addition to the foregoing qualifications, shall be examined in all the 
studies that have been pursued by that class since the commencement 
of the Freshman year. 
“Suc. 4, The studies of the Freshman year shall be the Greek Testa- 
ment, Xenophon’s Cyropedia, Mair’s Introduction, Virgil, Cicero’s Ora- 
tions, Roman Antiquities, arithmetic, English grammar, and Sheridan’s
-P-A-G-E-154
  138 HIGHER EDUCATION IN SOUTH CAROLINA. 
Lectures on Elocution. A part of every day’s Latin lesson shall be 
written ina fair hand, with an Hnglish translation, and correctly spelled. 
“Sno, 5. The studies of thé Sophomore year shall be Homer’s Hiad, 
Horace, vulgar and decimal fractions, with the extraction of roots, 
geography, Watts’s Logic, Blair’s Lectures, algebra, the French lan 
guage, and Roman Antiquities. 
“Sno. 6. The studies of the Junior year shall be Elements of Criti- 
cism, geometry, theoretical and practical astronomy, natural and moral 
philosophy, French, Longinus de Sublimitate, and Cicero de Oratore. 
“Src. 7. The studies of the Senior year shall be Millot’s Elements of 
History, Demosthenes’ Select Orations, and such parts of Locke’s Essay 
as shall be prescribed by the faculty. The Seniors also shall review 
such parts of the studies of the preceding year, and perform such exer- 
cises in the higher branches of the mathematics, as the faculty may 
direct. 
“Sno. 8. From the time of their admission into college, the students 
shall be exercised in composition and public speaking, for which pur- 
pose such a number as the faculty shall direct shall daily, in rotation, 
deliver orations in the college hall. There shall also be public exhibi- 
tions, and competition in speaking, and other exercises, held at such 
times and under such regulations as the faculty shall require ; and every 
member of the Senior class shall, at least once each month, deliver an 
oration of his own composition, after submitting it to be perused and 
corrected by the president.” 
There was a gradual evolution of this course. In 1810 the first re- 
port of the president that is recorded (November 10th) shows that conic 
sections, trigonometry, logarithms, and mechanics had been added to 
the course, and also lectures on chemistry to the Senior class.!. This 
report also urges the appointment of a professor of chemistry, and one 
of law to deliver lectures to the two upper classes. The suggestion 
with regard to the professorship of chemistry was followed the next year 
by the election of ©. D. Simons to the chair. The professorship of law 
was not established until 1866. 
The report of the standing committee of the board of trustees on 
November 30, 1815, contains some very interesting suggestions and 
facts. They wished to keep the college on a footing with northern insti- 
tutions, and urged on the board the propriety of establishing profes- 
sorships of political economy, elocution, and belles-lettres, of raising the 
requirements for admission, in order that a more liberal course in the 
sciences might be given, but earnestly advised the appointment at once 
of a professor of mineralogy. Owing to want of funds these sugges- 
tions were not carried out, but they show the advanced views of the 
men who had charge of the school. 
From the report of the examinations it is seen that Evidences of Chris- 
tianity had been added to the list of studies. But in the two upper 
‘La Borde, p. 42. 
 
-P-A-G-E-155
SOUTH CAROLINA COLLEGE. 139 
classes, it is also seen from this report, there were no studies in Latin 
and Greek.! Thomas Cooper in 1822 had regretted the slight attention 
paid to the ancient languages, and very sensibly declared that a short 
course of study was worse than none, and stated that these languages 
at first had been studied only during the Freshman year, but rejoiced 
that this had been remedied by requiring a four-years’ course, though 
the selection of authors was still limited.? 
This slight attention to Latin was not remedied until after 1820, for 
in that year the president reported the course of study, and no Latin or 
Greek appears in the last two years. The entrance examinations were 
the same, except that St. Luke and the Acts of the Apostles were added. 
In the Senior year, Butler’s Analogy, metaphysics, and mineralogy 
were also added. In 1820 the ever-active Thomas Cooper recommended 
the establishment of mineralogy and geology into a separate chair. 
This was done, and Lardner Vanuxem was elected professor at a salary 
of one thousand dollars. 
The faculty in 1829 recommended the appointment of a teacher of the 
Hebrew, Arabic, and modern languages, and it was done at the end of 
the year. The following resolution, which was passed December 28, 
1829, at a meeting of the faculty, shows the feelings and position of the 
faculty with regard io a knowledge of Latin: Resolved, unanimously, 
That in future no certificate shall be accepted from any teacher unless 
writtenin Latin. Also that applicants for admission shall address them- 
selves in writingin the Latin language to the faculty, and this exercise 
shal! be performed in the presence of the faculty.” * 
COURSE IN 1836. 
Thomas Cooper brought the college to the brink of ruin, and when 
he was removed, in 1834, and R. W. Barnwell was elevated to the chair, 
there was a reorganization. In 1836 the requirements for admission 
were raised, and now were added fractions and extraction of roots, and 
one book of Homer. To the regular course were added Davies’ Men- 
suration and Surveying, descriptive geometry, fluxions, Tytler’s His- 
tory, and political economy, and the study of the classics was carried 
through the four years, several new authors being added. To counter- 
act the influence of Cooper’s teachings, the “ department of sacred lit- 
erature and evidences of Christianity ” was established, with Bishop 
Elliott as professor. 
From this time there was little change in the entrance examinations 
and in the ancient languages, but, in common with other colleges, the 
South Carolina College widely extended the course in mathematics 
and the sciences. The other institutions began a system of electives,

and this makes it difficult to compare the courses of study, as there 
were practically no electives in this college; the entrance qualifica- 
tions furnish almost the only fair measure for the standard under such 
circumstances. The requirements for entrance in 1862 appear high, 
even at the present day. ‘ i 
The examinations for entrance were all written, and the “ require- 
ments * * * were strictly enforced,” says Prof. W. J. Rivers, of the 
college. !

for the South Carolina College, Harvard, Yale, and Columbia.

      COURSE IN TIISTORY AND POLITICAL ECONOMY. 
If there were any branches in which the college was abreast of the 
most advanced in the country, it was in the above two. Its second 
president had published a text-book on political economy in the earlier 
part of the century, among the first ever published in this country. The 
study of oratory, of government, and of politics was almost a necessity 
with southern youth. They were almost confined to the learned pro- 
fessions. The circumstances of their life turned their chief attention to 
politics and government. No other weapon could so wield an influence 
as eloquence. Debating societies were almost a necessity of their col- 
lege life. Nearly all the colleges recognized this and furnished halls 
for them and encouraged the cultivation of public speaking. The am- 
bition of the youth was chiefly to enter public life, and lead the people by 
oratory. Not much attention was paid to literature; in fact, the few 
authors they had bitterly complained of the neglect of their writings.

Southern life demanded a knowledge of history, of politics, and of 
the basis of government. The far-seeing educators saw this need of 
the South and provided for it. They furnished courses that would give 
training in language and a command over words. The classical course, 
as has been seen, was very fully developed, and much attention was 
paid to rhetoric. Their first president, in his report of 1810, spoke of 
the study of ancient history by the Senior class. In 1815 the standing 
committee of the board of trustees advised the establishment of a pro. 
fessorship of politicaleconomy. It is, of course, hardly known, but this 
is probably the first serious proposal for such a purpose in the United 
States. It clearly illustrates the tendency of the Southern mind to- 
ward all those subjects that are connected with a broad statesman- 
ship. Nothing was done toward establishing a full professorship of 
economics for some years after. Elocution, composition, and public 
speaking before the faculty were required of all. The ever-busy and 
active Thomas Cooper, who wrote a work on political economy, gave 
lectures on the subject to the members of his classes. Jn 1823 he was 
asked by the faculty to teach metaphysics, but he suggested political 
economy instead. His suggestion was accepted, and the following year 
he commenced his lectures on this subject, and by the end of his term 
aregular chair of political economy and history had been established. 
A full professorship of history and political economy was established 
‘in 1835, with Francis Lieber as professor. Even politicians showed their 
interest in the subject. George McDuffie, when Governor in 1836, in 
his message took ground against the exclusive study of the classics, as 
tending to disqualify young men for “the rugged realities of life.” 
“To counteract this tendency, a concise popular history of our own 
country, written in a pure, simple style, and a clear exposition of the 
great fundamental principles of our government, should be introduced 
into all our grammar schools. * * * It should be provided in the 
regulations of the college that no young manshould enter the Sopho- 
more class who could not stand an examination on the historical nar- 
ration, nor the Senior class who could not stand examination on the 
political exposition.” This undoubtedly had its effect, since the cata- 
logue of 1838 shows that history was studied for four years, instead of 
two years, as had previously been the case. 
In 1843, besides the full professor of history and political economy, 
the subject of “ politics” was studied under another professor in the 
Senior year. Four years later the catalogue is more definite, and it is 
seen that the Freshmen studied ancient history ; the Sophomores, history 
of the Middle Ages; Juniors, modern history and political philosophy ; 
while the Seniors enjoyed the benefit of Lieber’s instruction in political 
economy and political ethics. The faculty required history and geog- 
raphy for entrance, and urged that the best method to give instruction

   in “ancient geography is always to use an atlas in the reading of Greek 
and Latin authors.” 
There has been but little change in these courses since then to the 
present time; a fuller course of history is now given in the first two 
years, political economy in the third year, and constitutional law in the 
fourth. 
      
                
  EXAMINATIONS.    
   
     In the early years of the college, all examinations were public and 
oral, and probably continued so during the half century to 1854. About 
1851 one of the board of visitors, in his report, approved very cordially 
of the mode of written examinations. The year following Dr. Thorn- 
well, the newly-elected president, proposed that the examinations be 
held in writing, in order that they might be thorough. ‘The plan of 
written examinations has been pursued from that day to the present.”              
      
   
                                         
      
   HONORS. 
The two chief honors were the first and second places in class stand- 
ing, and to these places were awarded the valedictory and salutatory, 
respectively. After 1521 these were changed in grade. About 1853 the 
number of honors was increased by dividing the students into three 
grades. Those in first grade received honors, those in second received 
distinctions, the third simply passed. The faculty had reached this 
method by dividing all studies into two departments, one comprehend- 
ing ‘all the studies which may be said to depend on moral evidence;” 
the second, those sciences “ which depend on experiment and demon- 
stration.” The students who were distinguished in both branches were 
put into the first grade; those distinguished in one only were put into 
the second; while the others simply passed.. At present the scheme 
of two departments is omitted, and the honors are dependent on the 
general average of the eourse, while the two grades now receive ‘ hon- 
ors” and “appointments.” Medals were given during some years for 
excellence in some special branches, one of which was elocution. They 
were worth about fifty dollars each. The degree of B. A. was conferred 
from the beginning, and later that of M. A. was added. The usual 
honorary degrees were conferred, but not lavishly. That of LL. D. was 
given only nine times up to 1862, and only to such men as Gessner 
Harrison, W. H. Trescott, and Joseph Henry.'   SCHOLARSHIPS. 
The college was the work of the State, and looked to the State alone 
for aid. Its expenses have been met by State appropriations and tui- 
tion fees from the beginning; with but few exceptions, nothing has ever 
been received from any other source. Some gentlemen have given their

private libraries, and some have founded scholarships. The State of 
course founded none, except for a few years during Reconstruction. 
Tn 1862 there were five scholarships, yielding an aggregate annual 
income of one thousand five hundred and forty dollars. At present 
these only exempt the holders from the annual tuition fee, which is very 
small. The two literary societies each had a beneficiary, and some- 
times a class supported a member. 
In the Free School Act of 1811, it was provided that one boy from the 
Orphan House iu Charleston should be sent to the college free of all ex- 
pense. R.F. W. Alston, who took such a deep interest in the education 
of the day, recommended, in his message in 1858, that the college put a 
scholarship at the disposal of each of the following institutions: Charles- 
ton College, Furman, Wofford, Erskine, Saint John’s, and Mount Zion; 
but nothing came of it. In 1862 the faculty were allowed to receive free 
of tuition one scholar from each judicial district, sent by the commis- 
sioners of free schools within that district. 
In 1865, on the inauguration of the university plan, a free scholarship 
was given to each election district, to be awarded by the vote of the mem- 
bers of the Legislature from that district. In 1873-74 one hundred 
and twenty-four scholarships, yielding two hundred dollars each, were 
established by the Legislature, one for each member of the House of 
Representatives. These were awarded on competitive examination. 
This was all abolished in 1876. 
Tuition had been charged in the college down to its reorganization 
in 1880-82. Thomas Cooper had urged during his presidency, that as 
there was no charge for elementary education, there should be none 
for collegiate. Owing to the opposition of the denominational colleges 
for the past few years, it was decided that there should be a charge for 
tuition, though Cooper’s argument would apply as strongly now as ever. 
The tuition fixed by the last Legislature in 1886 can be remitted for 
poor boys at the option of the faculty. 
At present there are six tutorships (fellowships), which are given to’ 
graduate students, who are expected to pursue graduate work under 
the direction of the faculty, and teach in certain branches. 
THOMAS COOPER. 
Thomas Cooper and Francis Lieber are prominent among the men con- 
nected with the South Carolina College who have made a reputation for 
themselves beyond the limits of the State. While the former cannot be 
compared with the latter in the lasting impression of his work, he was 
much more widely known in the State, and he left a mark on the history 
of the college more enduring than Lieber’s. To-day the college feels the 
effect of Cooper’s labors, though at one time it almost failed, through 
his opposition to religious beliefs generally received. 
When the college had been fairly started, it enjoyed the support of 
the whole State, as the denominational colleges had not then been es-

tablished. At the present day, some of the friends of these iirstitutions 
charge that Cooper is the cause of their having been founded, as parents 
were afraid to send their sons to a school whose president derided their 
most cherished faith. Hach denomination founded its own institution, 
rather than have the young men trained under the influence and teach- 
ing of Dr. Cooper. 
On the death of Maxcy, Cooper was made temporary president, and 
a year later became permanent head of the college. 
Thomas Cooper was born in London, in 1759, and was educated at 
Oxford, where he paid much attention to the classics, though his incli- 
nation was for the sciences. His was the outgrowth of that revolution 
in thought -and feeling which culminated in the French Revolution. 
He imbibed the views of the revolutionists and went to France, where 
he was closeted with Robespierre, Pétion, and other Jacobin leaders. 
He ran against the Duke of Orleans for a seat in the Convention. He 
stayed in Paris four months, and in after years he said this was the 
happiest time of his life ; that in these four months he lived four years. 
For this visit to France he was severely attacked by no less a person 
than Edmund Burke in the House of Commons. He defended himself 
with vigor and strength, but was refused the privilege of publishing 
his defence in cheap pamphlet form, as the Attorney-General feared it 
might have a bad effect on the lower classes. 
He came to America and settled as a lawyer in Pennsylvania. His 
bold revolutionary nature carried him into the politics of this country, 
aud of course against the repressive Alien and Sedition Acts of John 
Adams. For a violent attack on this President he was sentenced in 
1800 to a fine of four hundred dollars and imprisoned for six months. 
One of the counts in the indictment was based on a statement in one 
of Cooper’s newspaper articles, that the President “was but in the in- 
fancy of political mistakes.” In 1825 Cooper petitioned for a restitution 
of the fine, basing his argument on the unconstitutionality of the acts, 
and a few years before his death the fine was refunded with interest... It 
    
1A collection of Cooper’s letters to Hon. Mahlon Dickerson has lately come into the 
possession of Mr, William Nelson, of New Jersey, and through his kindness the author 
has been permitted to examine them. The references in this correspondence show 
that Cooper labored long and unceasingly for this restitution. 
It is also very clear that he did this as a matter of principle, and not for the sake 
of the few dollars that he might get by it, though he admits that the amount of fine 
and interest would be a “windfall” to him. He considered that his fine and impris- 
onment represented an attack on the liverties of the people, and that the wrong 
should be righted for that reason, and not for any personal advantage to himself. 
In his letter of January 31, 1826, he writes to Mr. Dickerson: ‘‘ Pray do not let any 
personal interest in the question form the slightest obstacle to an expression of opin- 
ion on the part of the Legislature. Do justice to the public and give me up without 
scruple. The whole doctrine of libelis founded on judicial legislation, beginning 
with the star-chamber case de Libellis, famous, reported by Lord Coke, and matured 
by the adherents of government till it is now too heavy for the people to bear.” 
Again, two weeks later, on February 13th, he writes to Mr, Dickerson: ‘‘Do not

was probably Cooper’s boldness that led President Adams afterward 
to refer to him as “a learned, ingenious, scientific, and talented mad- 
cap.”! 
After his release from jail he was appointed land commissioner and 
afterward judge. From this office he was removed in 1811 for arbi- 
trary conduct. He had held the office only five years when he was im- 
peached by the Senate of Pennsylvania for many small acts of petty 
tyranny. He had imprisoned a man for not pulling off his hat; he had 
committed three persons for “ whispering ;” and it was a regular thing 
with him to browbeat counsel, witnesses, and parties to a suit. By a 
vote of fifty-nine to thirty-four a resolution was passed requesting the 
Governor to remove him from office.2, The wonderful versatility of his 
genius is again illustrated by the powers he displayed in some of his 
judgments. His decision in one case was recommended by Judge Brack. 
  
let any personal interest in the petition stand in the way to bar (?) any public meas- 
ure for a moment. If you can carry any measure (?) or any resolution valuable to 
the public by giving up my petition, do not hesitate a moment. What I want is, to 
impress the public out-of-doors with the absolute necessity of full and free discussion 
of every question within the range of human inquiry in order to arrive at truth. The 
whole doctrine of libel is in direct hostility with the improvement of mankind. I 
know of no question so important as the right of free discussion, untrammelled a priori 
and subject to no punishment for its exercise.” 
A hasty perusal of these letters, though they are few in number, increases our re- 
spect for the extent of Dr. Cooper’s acquirements, and the activity of his interest. 
We are astonished that this chemist and mineralogist kept up so closely with both 
State and national politics, observed so acutely the tendency toward centralization, 
expressed fears against opening the door too widely for bench legislation, lest 
“twenty wagon-loads of all kinds of decisions may enter,” referred to Mill’s essay on 
the right of free discussion, passed opinions on legal articles in the Westminster Re- 
view; and read Bentham’s work on jurisprudence. He is afraid that in the debate 
something will be said about the common law, and he begs his friend to look up the 
definition of that term “given by Willis, Astor, Yates, and Mansfield in the great 
case of literary property, Miller and Taylor vs. Burrowes, twenty-three volumes.” 
Mr. Webster and the government party had raised the point against granting’ 
Cooper’s petition that it would be an interference with a judicial decision. Cooper 
wrote a long letter to his friend Dickerson containing an argument under four heads 
which would enable him to meet this objection. In his reasoning he showed a thor- 
ough acquaintance with the Constitution and with constitutional law. 
Our surprise at the versatility of the man becomes still greater when we see that 
in the midst of all this distraction, he could write: ‘‘I have heard nothing yet con- 
cerning the two boxes of minerals from Dr. Fowler’s and your house. These interest 
me, I believe, full as much as the petition.” 
Other letters in this valuable collection contain some of Cooper’s opinions on Chris- 
tianity. 
The life of this lawyer, politician, chemist, mineralogist, thinker, radical, educator, 
would be an interesting chapter in American history, and would form an important 
addition to educational and economic science. The material can be gathered through 
the kind co-operation of Cooper’s admirers, and by patient search in the libraries, and 
it is likely that this work will be done in the next few years.

enridge to every American student of law, ‘as a model which deserved 
to be admired.”! 
He then applied himself to chemistry, in which he had already made 
some discoveries, and was elected professor of chemistry in Dickinson 
College, Carlisle, and later in the University of Pennsylvania. He 
soon made a reputation in this study. He was an intimate friend of 
Priestley, and kept abreast of the progress of the science in Europe. 
He had discovered how to make chlorine from common: salt, and had 
been a bleacher in England. 
He was chosen by Jefferson for the newly-founded University of Vir- 
ginia, but his Unitarian views were so distasteful to the orthodox party 
that he resigned. In 1819 he was elected professor of chemistry in the 
South Carolina College. He took control of the college as president a 
year later, with every prospect of success. He had made a fine reputa- 
tion while teaching chemistry for one year, and many felt that it was an 
excellent choice ; but he received only ten votes out of the nineteen 
trustees. 
PERSONAL APPEARANCE. 
  One of his old pupils, J. Marion Sims,’ the famous gynecologist of 
New York, described him as ‘considerably over seventy years old—a 
remarkable looking man. He was never called Doctor Cooper, but old 
‘Coot.’ ‘Coot’ is the short for ‘ Cooter, a name generally applied in 
the South by the negroes to the terrapin, and the name suited him 
exactly. He was less than five feet high, and the head was the biggest 
part of the whole man. He was a perfect taper from the side of his 
head down to his feet; he looked like a wedge with a head on it.” A 
bust of him in the college shows a head almost a parallelopiped. Tt is 
the “squarest head” one ever sees. A silhouette of him shows him with 
stooping shoulders, a great baggy coat, pantaloons baggy at the top 
and terminating in a tight band and broad ruffle at the foot.

with him, see Circular of Information of the Bureau of Education, No. 1, 1888: 
Thomas Jefferson and the University of Virginia, pp. 56-61 and 106-109. 
Jefferson was indignant at the hue and cry raised in the Virginia pulpits over his 
appointment of Cooper to the Virginia University, and he very much regretted to 
give him up. ‘TI do sincerely lament,” he said, ‘ that untoward circumstances have 
brought on us the irreparable loss of this professor, whom I have looked to as the 
coruer-stone of our edifice. I know no one who could have aided us so much in form- 
ing the future regulations for our infant institution; and although we may perhaps 
obtain from Europe equivalents in science, they can never replace the advantages of 
his experience, his knowledge of the character, habits, and manners of our country, 
his identification with its sentiments and principles, and high reputation he has ob- 
tained in it generally.” Pp. 108-109,

HIS CHARACTER. 
Although he wrote a great deal, it cannot be said that his work 
lived. His work in chemistry is all forgotten, while his friend Priestley, 
who was very much like him, is remembered. His capacity was almost 
unbounded, and his stores of information wonderful. His conver- 
sation was very interesting. He remembered what he read and he told 
it well. He had travelled through Europe, and had become acquainted 
with the best known characters of England and the leading Revolu- 
tionists of France. He knew Burke and Pitt, Fox and Erskine and 
Sheridan, and could relate many entertaining anecdotes of his inter- 
course with them. ‘A Boswell could have found in his table-talk 
much that was worthy of preservation.” 
His genius was entirely utilitarian. He was a pronounced material- 
ist, and loved only those studies that are connected with supplying the 
bodily wants of man. All others he despised. 
His materialistic, unpoetic nature is most clearly seen in his view of 
oratory, given in his address to the graduating class of 1821: “The whole 
history of ancient oratory shows that it was little else than the art of 
cheating the understanding of a gaping populace, by amusing their im- 
aginations and exciting their passions; and that all modern oratory is 
to be held in the same estimation. * * * He who studies to be elo- 
quent will never study to be wise; a dealer in tropes, metaphors, allego- 
ries, and similes is seldom a dealer in facts.”! 
In 1823 he was asked by the board to teach metaphysics. He pro- 
fessed himself ‘ qualified and competent to teach metaphysics, having 
devoted much more time to that very unsatisfactory study than most 
men; so much so as to be fully persuaded that it is not worth the time re- 
quired to be bestowed upon it.” So strong was his influence that a 
committee was appointed to consider the abolishment of the study al- 
together. 
The most prominent trait in his character was his restless activity. 
He busied himself in all matters around him. He went into the polities 
of every country he settled in. He got into trouble on account of his 
political views in Pennsylvania, and he made himself obnoxious to a 
large party in South Carolina. 
He entered most vigorously into the nullification fight, and it was very 
largely the outcome of his teaching in political economy on the tariff 
that the feeling against protection was so strong. 
His connection with politics in England and France has already been 
related. His tireless energy carried him into all fields of thought. He 
wrote on law, jurisprudence, and medicine; he translated the Institutes 
of Justinian, and lectured on chemistry. Thomas Jefferson said of him,

148 HIGHER EDUCATION IN SOUIH CAROLINA. . 
“Cooper is acknowledged by every enlightened man who knows him 
to be the greatest man in America in the powers of his mind and in 
acquired information, and that without a single exception.”! 
He had very pronounced and advanced views on education, which he 
urged in his vigorous way upon the board of trustees. He called for a 
free college as well as for free schools. He held that the State should 
freely furnish facilities for all, and that no other course could be defend- 
ed on the grounds of justice or expediency. His views for the college 
were not adopted until 1880-82, and then were laid aside again in 1886. 
He was an ardent nullifier, and a strong adherent of Calhoun. Tight- 
ing all his life for freedom, now in France, in England, in Pennsylvania, 
and now for religious freedom in South Carolina, he yet held that sla- 
very was a necessary evil within one hundred miles of the sea-coast. 
But he was perfectly independent in his views, and entirely free from 
shams. He despised mere professions, and never made any himself. He 
was free from petty jealousy. Even after he had been removed from 
the college, he urged on the board the propriety of conferring the de- 
gree of doctor of laws on Joseph Henry, and was successful in his ap- 
peal. Chemistry was his first love, and he greatly interested himself 
to see that the chair was filled by a man worthy to teach the science. 
He put in nomination Professor Ellet, of New York, and he was elected. 
He seemed to be free from malice of all kind. He was bold, aggressive, 
and dogmatic. He defended nullification and greatly strengthened 
that side, but he offended many who held opposite views. They could 
not help complaining that he was not brought there to rush into poli- 
tics, but to teach chemistry. But in all the private relations of life he 
was without fault. 
AS AN EDUCATOR. 
In the professor’s chair no man was ever more successful. He real- 
ized to the fullest that the first step in teaching is to gain the pupil’s 
attention. This he did in the highest degree. No man knew better 
how to weave in with a lecture on magnesia an anecdote of Burke, 
or a description of a supper with the Brissotians, or a glass of wine 
with Robespierre. He stated the great truths of his science with child- 
like simplicity. He loved chemical work himself, and he inspired an 
enthusiasm for itin others. The science was practically new, and he first 
introduced the names and methods of Watt, of Davy, and of Priestley. 
He lectured in a popular, pleasant way, but never loosely or unscien- 
tifically. 
In his political economy he held advanced views as to the importance 
of the study. He delivered an address at the commencement in 1824, 
in which he recommended the study of this modern science. Two years 
later he issued his lectures on political economy, in the preface of which 
he says: “In this country political economy and the theory of polities are

of peculiar importance. BHvery well-educated young man throughout 
the United States considers himself a politician, and whatever other 
pursuits he may embark in, he is sure to pay attention enough to poli- 
tics. Moreover, our Legislature contains so many gentlemen brought up 
at this institution, and is so likely in future to bein the same situation, 
that a young man going from the college without some elementary no- 
tions relating to this modern branch of knowledge, would be but ill 
prepared for the duties which some years hence he may be called upon 
to undertake. Atany rate, an enlightened public will make an enlight- 
ened Legislature ; and those representatives who appear ignorant of that 
which every gentleman ought to know, will not long continue to misrep- 
resent those who are gradually becoming wiser than themselves.” ! 
Speaking on the same subject in the preface to his Manual of Politi- 
cal Eeonomy, issued in 1833, he adds: “It is melancholy for an 
American to know and to feel that at this day, the elementary truths 
of a science on which all the reflecting men of the old country are 
fully agreed, should be matter of dispute in the Congress of the United 
States; and that our most prominent statesmen should disgrace them- 
selves by contesting the plainest axioms of modern knowledge. The 
next generation will be wiser, and will look back with the same sur- 
prise that I do.”? 
In this little manual of only one hundred and nine pages he treated 
of the various branches of political economy, of agriculture, of free 
trade, tariff, money, banks, population, primogeniture, and education. 
He outlined a liberal course of State education, with a grammar school 
at every court-house and in every township, and at least two colleges; 
all leading up to a finely endowed University, with a full corps of pro- 
fessors in every department. He strongly emphasized that all the 
schools should be free, from the highest to the lowest. 
HIS INFIDEL VIEWS. 
His success as a teacher was great, but as president he nearly de- 
stroyed the institution. There are two general reasons for this fail- 
ure, his ignorance of Southern character and his infidel views. 
A spirit of honor had grown up among the students, and they scorned 
to tell a lie when put on their word of honor, or to combine to shield 
athief. The students of this college and of the University of Virginia, 
which set the example for all the other Southern schools, dared not 
cheat on an examination, as they would be ostracised. This sentiment, 
which is still strong with them, Doctor Cooper could not understand, 
and consequently he had trouble with the students. He was not dis- 
posed to rely on their honor, but rather went on the assumption that 
they all needed careful watching and questioning. This the boys in- 
dignantly rejected, and retaliated by combinations and boycotts of the 
faculty.

But other presidents had just as much trouble, probably, in the man- 
agement of the students as he had, and this is not alone a full explana- 
_ tion of the failure. Unfortunately for his success and the prosperity of 
the college, his busy spirit meddled with the teachiag of Christianity. 
He had met and admired the savants of Paris, and had sat at the feet 
of the bold skeptics of England, and had imbibed the most pronounced 
views against this religion. A man of his intense earnestness and act- 
ive restlessness could not refrain from entering into a discussion of the 
subject. Not only must he attack it in private, but also in his lectures 
and in pamphlets. 
It was not necessary for him to take any position on the question 
whatever; the trustees required no religious test further than attend- 
ance at chapel services, and the people demanded none. But he con- 
sidered it a form of error, and, according to the ideas he held, it must 
be corrected like any other error. It filled a large part of the time of 
many people and occupied a large space in the world, and its falsity must 
be shown, just as he would show the false position of the protection- 
ists; it must be met, combated, and overthrown, just as any false 
theory in political economy must be overthrown. As has been said, the 
people were very religious. It was dangerous ground for any one in 
the State college to walk on, but bold and aggressive Thomas Cooper 
trod it firmly. “The man walked rough-shod over other men’s opin- 
ions, and suffered the inevitable consequences.”! He prepared a lecture 
on the Authenticity of the Pentateuch, which he delivered every year 
to the members of the Senior class a few weeks before graduating, and 
followed it up with a pamphlet on the same subject. 
DOCTOR COOPER ON GEOLOGY AND THE PENTATEUCH. 
His infidel teachings exercised so great an influence on his life there 
and onthe subsequent history of State education in South Carolina, that 
this pamphlet and lecture, which disseminated them most widely, and 
were the greatest cause of offence, demand some notice. 
In the first years of Cooper’s presidency at South Carolina College, 
geology was taught at no other institution in America except Yale, 
and for want of an American text-book, both Cooper and Silliman were 
forced to use the English edition of Bakewell’s Geology. But in ashort 
time Professor Silliman prepared an edition of Bakewell, adding to it 
the syllabus of his own lectures, which he “ founded on the Mosaic ac- 
count of the formation of the earth and of the Deluge, as being deliv- 
ered under the authority of divine inspiration.” As Cooper could get 
only the American edition for his class, he was forced to put into 
their hands a view of geology quite different from what he himself had 
taught. So he delivered a lecture to the class, attacking Silliman’s 
position; and since this brought on him ‘“ much trouble,” he wrote his

son and the University of Virginia, p. 77.

SOUTH CAROLINA COLLEGE—THOMAS COOPER. 161 
pamphlet on the Connection between Geology and the Pentateuch. He 
called in question the right of attributing the authorship of the Penta- 
teuch to Moses, since it is nowhere claimed in the “bible” (which he al- 
ways wrote with a small letter) that) Moses was the author of it. The 
supposed references to the Law of Moses can not, in his opinion, mean 
the Pentateuch, but only a small part of the law that Moses delivered 
to the people. 
Doctor Cooper went “ out of the routine of the duties of his office” to 
urge his views as to the authorship of the Pentateuch, and Dr. Sims 
wondered ‘that a country as full of Presbyterianism and bigotry as that 
was at that time * * * should have tolerated a man in his position, 
especially when advocating and teaching upon such an unnecessary sub- 
ject. Doctor Cooper lived before his day. If he had flourished now, « 
in the days of Darwin and Tyndall and Huxley, he would have been a 
greater infidel than any or all three of them put together.”' His teach- 
ings were carried to all parts of the State, and the ery of “reorganiza- 
tion! revolution!” was raised from the mountains to the sea-board. The 
trustees were firm in their support of Cooper, and nothing was done for 
several years. As the board of trustees was immovable, the point of 
attack was transferred to the House of Representatives. 
INVESTIGATION OF HIS TEACHINGS. 
On December 7, 1831, it was “ Resolved, That in the opinion of this 
House it is expedient that the board of trustees of the South Carolina 
College do forthwith investigate the conduct of Doctor Cooper as pres- 
ident of the South Carolina College, and if they find that his continu- 
ance in office defeats the ends and aims of the institution that they be 
requested to remove him.” The board instantly passed resolutions to 
investigate the matter. Full time was given for charges and answers, 
and Cooper defended himself in very full and elaborate reports and in 
a long speech at the trial. ' 
DOCTOR COOPER’S DEFENCE ON THE TRIAL, 
From his installation in office he had been the subject of incessant 
attacks from the religious elements of the State, and finally the matter 
culminated in this trial before a committee of the board of trustees. He 
was charged with advancing opinions on religion offensive to the pa- 
trons of the school and injurious to its interests, and with interfering 
with the religious opinions of the students. The main evidence was the 
passages from his different publications, but chiefly from his Political 
Economy, Letter to Any Member of Congress, and his translation of 
Broussais on Insanity. There was also a letter from Dr. Thomas Tay- 
lor substantiating the third count, but this evidence was positively con- 
tradicted by six other witnesses. 7 
Doctor Cooper eloquently defended himself in a speech of several

hours in length before the committee on the 5th and 6th of December, 
1832. He declared that this trial was a return to the inquisitorial 
courts of the Middle Ages, and was especially significant at the time 
when South Carolina was tremblingly alive to the usurpations and in- 
fractions of the General Government. His opinions on materialism, on 
a salaried clergy, and public prayer, and other liberal views were all 
shared by John Milton, Thomas Jefferson, and by many prominent 
churchmen. No man after full examination could say that the Penta- 
teuch was written by Moses, and he himself would scruple to give ere- 
dence to the oath of any man who could think so. 
The Constitution of the United States and of South Carolina guaran- 
teed freedom of religious belief and practice. Was it to be guaranteed 
in South Carolina and withheld from the South Carolina College? He 
denied that his teachings were injurious to the interests of the college, 
since, under his administration, the largest number of students in the 
history of the college, with one exception, had applied for admission. 
So far from interfering with the religious opinions of the students, he 
had carefully impressed upon them, as every witness testified, to “fol- 
low, while at college, the religion of their parents.” But he claimed for 
himself the right to hold any speculative opinions he chose, and ap- 
peared unable to see any inconsistency in a student’s being practically 
all right, but’ theoretically all wrong, as he would be if he followed Doc- 
tor Cooper’s practice and teaching. The trial was held in the Hall of the 
House of Representatives, and was attended by a large number of the 
members of the Legislature and citizens, and the speech was frequently 
applauded. 
Three days after this Speech, on December 8, 1832, the board reached 
a conclusion, and fully exonerated him in a resolution, ‘That no charges 
against Doctor Cooper, showing that his continuance in office defeats 
the ends and aims of the institution or authorizes his removal, have 
been substantiated by proof, and that the charges against him be 
therefore dismissed.” This added fuel to the flame; the outeries were 
redoubled; and one year after, Cooper resigned the presidency, but 
held his professorship. ‘Still his opponents were not satisfied, and it 
soon became evident that Doctor Cooper must resign or the college 
must close its doors; so in 1834 his connection with the college was 
finally severed. 
At this late day it is very difficult to reach a just conclusion as to 
his belief. ‘In philosophy he was a materialist, and in religion a free- 
thinker,” is the opinion of a contributor to Appleton’s Cyclopedia. 
This general statement cannot be denied, but what particular form of 
religious belief his free-thinking made him reject can hardly be deter- 
mined. It can be said without fear of mistake that he hated the 
priesthood with all the concentrated energy of his nature. He de-

nounced them as a body self-organized for their own selfish aims, and 
never lost an opportunity to attack them. But there is testimony that 
he never attacked Christianity. But he did attack certain theories of 
the inspiration of Scripture. 
A witness in the case testified that he had heard Doctor Cooper abuse 
the clergy, but had never heard him say a word against the Christian 
religion. The historian of the college thinks that the board made the 
exculpating report out of sympathy for the old gentleman.’ 
This is the only instance of the kind in the history of the college, and 
it seemed unfortunate that the institution had to lose such faithful serv- 
ices. It was a State school, and the Constitution guaranteed freedom 
of religion; but it seemed unfair that he should take advantage of the 
pupils’ youth to poison their minds against the faith learned in child- 
hood. This course left its impress on the State, and to-day the enemies 
of higher State education point to Cooper as a frightful result of State 
training. It has made the trustees very careful since then to allow no 
effort of the sort to be made again. : 
COOPER’S WORKS. 
From this time to his death, May 11, 1839, he was occupied in the re- 
vision of the statutes of the State. This work had been given to him 
probably as a compensation for the loss of his position in the college. 
He published five volumes, the first of which contains a history of lib- 
erty as he understood it. It includes Magna Charta, Locke’s Constitu- 
tion, various charters relating to South Carolina, Ordinance of 1787, 
Constitution of the United States, Nullification Ordinance, and the vari- 
ous papers on the tariff brought out at that time, with notes by himself. 
He believed in putting in too much rather than too little. 
As has been said, he wrote and published a great deal, in books, 
in pamphlets, and in reviews, especially the Southern Quarterly. Many 
of his pamphlets are of course lost. The following list comprises the 
most of his works: Translation of the Institutes of Justinian; Transla- 
tion of Broussais; Medical Jurisprudence; The Emporium of Arts and 
Sciences (2 vols.); Lectures on the Elements of Political Economy ; 
Essay on the Pentateuch; Information Concerning America? In addi- 
tion to these, he wrote a number of articles in the Southern Quarterly 
Review.’ “His style was bold, sententious, and dogmatic, but clear, 
simple, and perspicuous.”

His Political Heonomy, which La Borde thinks has no value what- 
ever, does not claim to be anything but a course of lectures to imma- 
ture students on every-day facts of political economy. Cooper says in 
his preface: 
“In drawing up this very brief outline of political economy, I have 
consulted what was likely to be useful in the country and to the per- 
sons, where and to whom these lectures were to be delivered. I have 
but slightly touched those questions which form what may be called 
the metaphysics of political economy. I am not writing for adepts in 
this study, but for young men who enter upon it without any previous 
knowledge of its object or its uses. I have therefore been, without 
scruple and voluntarily, guilty of frequent repetitions, which to readers 
conversant with the subject will seem objectionable. I am not writing 
for that class of readers; by and by the young men who thank me for 
repetition now, will lay aside my book to study the more abstruse and 
nicer, but not more important, questions treated by Malthus, Ricardo, 
and McCulloch, never forgetting that they must begin with Adam 
Smith. In the aad year of these lectures I made use of Mrs. Marcet’s 
very neat Compendium of Political HKeonomy in her published conver- 
sations on that subject, and afterward of MeVickar’s republication of 
McCulloch’s Outlines, to which he has added some very useful notes. 
I have now published my own views of the subject, and some other 
topics connected with it, because I think my own lectures have been 
better understood by the class to whom they were delivered than the 
text-books I employed. Those who wish to pursue the subject would 
do well to peruse Adam Smith, Say, Malthus, Ricardo, McOulloeh, and 
Mill. The last author has drawn up an excellent compend (third edi- 
tion), which well deserves to be republished here. Mr. Cardozo, of 
Charleston, in his Notes on Political Economy, has shown himself pro- 
foundly icueinee 
and has entitled b 
thus and Ricardo with the nicer questions belonging to this science, 
imself to be read by those who wish to peruse Mal- 
ith full advantage. These lectures I trust will be 
found useful under the cireumstances that have dictated their compo- 
sition and prompted their publication. Of this I leave the public to 
judge.” | 
Within the limits laid down by bimself, Doctor Cooper has presented. 
his points in a clearer and more attractive style than can be found in 
most authors. The book is nowhere dry. Even where subsequent in- 
vestigations have rendered his ideas unauthoritative, they are always 
interesting as a history of economic thought. Cooper is one of the 
most advanced of the laissez-faire school. The title-page contains the 
famous question of Colbert and the laissez-faire answer of the mer: 
chants. 
In the main Cooper belongs’to the Ricardian school, as correcting 
Smith in some of his errors. He holds that the nation is merely the

collection of individuals, that national morality is identical with indi- 
vidual morality. He says: “‘Those rules of conduct which are best 
calculated to promote the mutual happiness of nations in their inter- 
course with each other as individuals, constitute the only maxims of 
the law of nations obligatory on all, because calculated for the perma- 
nent benefit of all.” (Political Economy, p. 29.) He further,adds: “A 
legislator might as well direct the analyses of the chemist, or the manip- 
ulations of the pin maker, as the pursuits of the planter, the manufact- 
urer, or the merchant” (p. 31); and, “every political community or na- 
tion ought to be considered as instituted for the good and the benefit of 
the many who compose it, and not of the few that govern it” (p. 33). 
Cooper denies Mill’s assertion that there can be no general glut. 
He insists that abstract economists assume too great mobility, and by 
no means make the allowance of time that is required. He holds (as 
J. S. Mill subsequently did) that the introduction of machinery worked 
temporary injury, but permanent benefit; though he differs from Mill as 
to the reason, giving the old theory that the invention makes more de- 
mand for labor, while Mill holds that the invention merely extends the 
limit of the pressure of population on subsistence. He differs from Ri- 
cardo and Malthus as to natural wages. Ricardo holds that natural 
wages are equal to what will enable laborers to live and perpetuate 
themselves without increase or decrease; and Malthus thinks that they 
are wages which, in the actual circumstances of society, are necessary 
to keep a supply of labor sufficient to meet the demand. But Cooper 
maintains that the difference between cost of labor and cost of commodi- 
ties lies in the fact that a bale of cloth can be withdrawn from the 
market and held until it brings cost of production, while the laborer 
must be employed or starve. He cannot wait, but must accept what 
is offered. Here, again, says Cooper, time must be considered. Wages 
must not be considered for accurate reasons as consisting of money or 
grain, but ‘in the proportion received by the laborer of the value at 
which the article he has been engaged on is sold or exchanged. The 
article produced and the price it brings in the market is the fund for 
buying labor and capital.” 
But space prevents a further analysis of the work. Of his Political 
Economy McCulloch, in his Literature of Political Economy, says: ‘This 
work, though not written in a philosophical spirit, is the best of the 
American works on political economy that we have ever met with.” Dr. 
Julius Kautz, a German writer, devotes half a page in his work to a 
notice of Cooper’s work on political economy, calling him the “radical 
and uncompromising opponent of the American protective system.”! 
His translation of the Institutes of Justinian, with notes, has of course 
been superseded, but it was among the best works of the kind when it

was issued, and undoubtedly gave a stimulus to the study of the civil 
law in this country.! 
His Information concerning America is an authority on the early in- 
dustrial and economic conditions of this country. It is, in fact, almost 
the only source for such information in the early period. 
STUDENT TROUBLES, 
The history of the college would be incomplete without some refer- 
ence to the numerous difficulties which occurred between the students 
and the authorities. They are not to be considered as mere fun and 
play of the students, which ended with the particular acts themselves, 
but as serious affairs affecting the reputation of the institution. For 
this reason the large space devoted to an account of them by La Borde 
is really very proper. The college was so intimately connected with 
public affairs, and so entirely dependent on the will of the Legislature, 
that every trouble within its walls was felt in the remotest corners of the 
State. The historian of the college describes them with all the minute- 
ness and intense gravity that would fit an important affair of State. 
They were the ordinary kind of boys’ frolics and troubles, although of 
almost every imaginable character. Soon after the organization of the 
college it was reported that professors’ houses had been stoned, and the 
professors called ‘‘liars” to their faces. 
In the early years of the college it was brought to the attention of the 
“Governor that there were certain practices among the students that 
prevented the boys of the low country from attending. ‘This officer 
gravely communicated to the faculty his belief that some failed to send 
their sons to Columbia on account of the use of tobacco by the students; 
but he thought te custom “exploded with us in genteel company, 
except where there may be one or two old confirmed smokers.” 
By 1810 the school-boy sport of turkey-stealing had been very fully — 
developed, and about this time that very “unliterary” amusement, fisti- 
cuffs, had also obtained a firm footing in the list of diversions. The 
excitement of the coming conflict with Great Britain probably called 
forth for the tee the use of fire-armson the campus. To get drunk 
and distribute free whisky at the well on the college campus, and go 
roaming around breaking windows, stoning professors’ houses, defying 
the faculty, seem to have been quite usual occurrences. The college 
authorities were powerless on one such occasion and appealed to the 
town, and obtained the aid of the militia. This riot, which broke out im-

mediately after evening prayers, notwithstanding the “serious and im- 
pressive address” by the president, lasted for a long time. 
A very general form of amusement was to remove the wooden steps 
that Jed to the building, and force the professors to climb a ladder. 
Whether it was due to Dr. Cooper’s lecture on the Authenticity of 
the Pentateuch or not, no one now can say, but true it is, the students 
permanently removed the chapel steps, and forced the grave profes- 
sors to climb a ladder in order to attend divine services. Every little 
event was taken advantage of by the students to avoid this service. A 
very light shower of rain at one time was sufficient to keep them in their 
rooms, though the president could walk through it “ without any in- 
convenience.”! Their notion of their rights forbade them to attend 
another professor when the regular one was sick and the classes were 
changed. 
The bell was stolen from the chapel, and the young dialecticians in- 
stantly agreed that it would be “unlawful” to attend recitations and. 
prayers without the sound of the bell, and they were always punctili- 
ous to obey all laws. A dinner bell in the hands of a negro was called 
into use, but the faculty had qualms of conscience on this point, since 
the law required the bell-ringer to be a white man. Their perplexing 
doubts were summarily settled by the students boldly taking the bell 
from him. This grave crisis was met by some shrewd trustee recom- 
mending that another bell be put in the cupola. “The effect was mag- 
ical; the students gave a prompt obedience, and the spirit of letters 
again breathed upon all its gentle influence.” ; 
At the foundation of the school, the Commons system of boarding 
had been adopted for the students and they were all forced to accept 
it, whether the steward gave proper accommodations or not. This had 
been the source of endless rebellions and boycotts by the students. 
Thomas Cooper had remarked in his vigorous way “that the college is 
in yearly jeopardy of being destroyed by the disputes about eating.” 
The matter was at first compromised by making the steward a salaried 
officer, but the question was not entirely settled until the system was 
abolished. 
The various difficulties at times seriously affected the attendance 
on the college exercises. The students combined to refuse informing on 
one of their number for any offence, and all but twenty-eight of them 
were suspended. Again, sixty were suspended, while at one session 
seventy-seven refused to return, because the petition on their favorite 
grievance, “eating,” had not been granted. This seems very serious 
when it is considered that the average attendance of the college for its 
whole history has been about one hundred and eighty, and but three 
times before the Civil War rising to two hundred. 
But the students were not always in the wrong. One of their num-

vely remarks that ‘it is not a thing of play to 
take hold of the calculus,” and when the professor of mathematics invited 
his class to try their strength with the difficulties, many declined the 
contest. The professor announced “ that it might be that half of his 
class were very smart fellows, for he never saw them; but the half who 
attended his recitations were as laborious as oxen, but as stupid as 
asses.” Even La Borde thought that ‘nothing could justify such 
language.” The students broke out into open rebellion, but “finally a 
treaty of peace was signed by the professors and class.”

RELIGIOUS SERVICES. 
Although an institution of the State, religious services were held in 
the chapel from the beginning. An appropriation was made for fitting 
up the chapel and, at two different times, for supplying it with psalm 
books. Morning and evening services were held and attendance on 
them enforced. The Sunday morning services were dispensed with at 
one time, but were restored by order of the faculty. The early regula- 
tions allowed a student to absent himself from Sunday services if his 
parents permitted it. But it was found that too many took advantage 
of this privilege of not attending any services at all, and the regulations 
were amended so as to insure better attendance. The rule now is to 
require each student to attend service at some church in the city, and 
it is enforced by calling the roll on Monday morning, each man answer- 
ing for himself. 
This strict enforcement of attendance on religious services was sup- 
plemented after Doctor Cooper’s removal by the establishment of a pro- 
fessorship of the evidences of Christianity and sacred literature. Bishop 
Elliott, of the Episcopal Church, was elected professor. This chair was 
discontinued at the reorganization in 1873, and the Sunday chapel 
services in 1885, but there is still a chaplain. It seems somewhat pe- 
culiar that the State should be so strict in this regard while the denomi- 
national colleges are so liberal. Very few of these in the State enforce 
the rules for attendance on divine worship, while some of the State 
schools of other States are careful to have no services at all. No serv- 
ices can be enforced in the public schools of the State. The continua- 
tion of these services in the college is probably due te the reaction 
against Thomas Cooper’s teachings. 
ROBERT W. BARNWELL. 
On the resignation of Thomas Cooper the college was reorganized, 
but nearly all the old professors were retained. The institution was in 
a very bad condition ; the religious people of the State had sent their 
sons to other colleges for training, and the whole number in college in 
1835 was reduced to twenty. A new man was elected for permanent 
president, Professor Henry having filled the office temporarily for a year. 
The man chosen was Robert W. Barnwell, who was born in the lower 
part of the State and belonged to one of the old aristocratic families. 
He had attended Mr. Hurlbut’s school in Charleston, and had grad- 
uated with the highest honors of his class at Harvard in 1821, when 
twenty years old. He served one term in the lower House of the Legisla- 
ture and two terms in Congress, voluntarily retiring from this posi-

PROFESSOR ROBERT HENRY. 
-This gentleman, a native of the State, was born in 1792. At the age 
of twenty-two he graduated at the University of Edinburgh, and on 
returning home entered the ministry. In 1818 he was elected profes- 
sor of logic and moral philosophy in the college. On the removal of 
Thomas Cooper he expected to be elevated to the presidency, but, 
unfortunately for him, popular clamor considered him as heretical as 
his old president, and refused him the honor. He tried to remove this 
prejudice by a sermon from the text, “I am not ashamed of the Gospel 
of Christ,” which he formally dedicated to the trustees of the college. 
He retired from the service of the college until he was recalled in 1839 
as professor, and three years later became president. 
He held this office until 1845, but was not very successful. His 
scholarship was not at all doubted, and his success as a teacher was 
gratifying, but the tumults, disorders, boycotts, and rebellions required 
for their control executive ability more than scholarship. The board 
diplomatically met the difficulty by electing him professor of Greek, 
and filling the president’s chair with another. He continued his con- 
nection with the college until his death in 1856. He published noth- 
ing except some magazine articles, some sermons, and eulogies; one of

the latter was upon John C. Calhoun. On his retirement from the office 
of president he was succeeded by 
WILLIAM C. PRESTON. 
William Campbell Preston was born in 1794 in Virginia. He was a 
grandson of Colonel William Campbell, who commanded at the battle 
of King’s Mountain, and was well fitted to take high rank among the 
people of South Carolina. He went South when a boy on account of 
pulmonary troubles. While travelling through South Carolina he first 
heard of the college, and applying for admission, astonished the Latin 
examiner by giving Dryden’s translation of the lines from Virgil. He 
graduated with distinction in 1812, making his commencement speech 
on the Life and Character of Jefferson. After travelling in this country 
and Europe for several years, he settled for the practice of law in Co- 
lumbia. He of course entered politics, as that was almost the only 
path for an ambitious young man, and rose very rapidly in his calling. 
In 1836 he was elected to the United States Senate. He there be- 
came the most finished orator of the stately, dignified, Southern school. 
His reputation became national. Being unable to follow his party, he 
retired to private life in 1842, and was elected to the presidency of the 
college in 1845. His reputation and election gave a great impetus to 
the attendance on the exercises. Never before or since have such num- 
bers been registered at any single session. The third year of his ad- 
ministration the number went to 222, and the fourth year to 237, the 
average for his whole term being 191. At only one other session before 
the Civil War did the list reach 200, and at no time since. 
His fame rests on his profound classical scholarship, his eloquence, and 
his powers of conversation. His grace of manner and his aptness of 
illustration have coined the word “ Prestonian,” that is even now heard 
in local use. His reputation asa cultivated gentleman and as a rhetori- 
cian attracted the students, and this was but natural, since it was only 
through the charms of rhetoric that they gould look for promotion in 
life. He was a man of public spirit. He devoted himself unceasingly 
to the work of the college, although his means did not at all require it. 
He founded the Columbian Atheneum, and bestowed his library of sev- 
eral thousand volumes upon it. His success as a disciplinarian was 
only fair, though he kept the tumults within reasonable bounds. He 
retired on account of failing health in 1851, and died in Columbia May 
22, 1860. 
THE TRAINING AT THE COLLEGE. 
The election and success of William C. Preston developed very strongly 
the training at the institution. Being the representative of the people, 
and at all times directly under their control, it was very sensitive to 
popular feeling and wants, and naturally would be quicker to respond 
11406—No, 3——11 
   
-P-A-G-E-184
  162 HIGHER EDUCATION IN SOUTH CAROLINA. 
to such needs than an institution founded on independent funds. The 
professions were honorable and essential stepping-stones for the attain- 
ment of high position in these large centres of population. 
Literary pursuits had not been successful. Even the novelist could 
get but few hearers. William Gilmore Simms, one of the most promi- 
nent of all the literary men of the State, bitterly lamented the lack 
of culture among the masses and the great indifference to literary 
pursuits. Nothing was left for the young men but to enter public life, 
and this was to be done chiefly through the doors of the law, and sue- 
cess in it depended mainly on eloquence and learning. Everything 
that could give fluency and aptness of illustration was carefully taught. 
Great stress was laid on the ancient languages, on rhetoric, and on the 
studies that relate to government. W. J. Rivers, a graduate and pro- 
fessor in the college for many years, said that the college ‘“ directed 
special attention to rhetoric and the study of the classics. Its excel- 
lence in these branches equalled, I may venture to say, that of any col- 
lege in the country.” The Constitution of the United States and of the 
State were required studies. John C. Calhoun’s work on government 
was made a text-book by act of Legislature. 
Furnishing the training necessary for young politicians, the college 
became aschool of politics. Gradually it came to be known and ree- 
ognized that a young politician was heavily handicapped if he received 
his education at another institution. Many of the graduates of the 
State institution were returned to the House of Representatives within 
a short time after taking their degrees. In this body they naturally 
formed a close corporation. They supported each other and kept 
down the outsiders. It was a vigorous organization, compact, and 
bold. They ruled the House, and through that influenced the State. 
No measure they opposed could become law. Hard. struggles were 
“made at times by the outsiders, but the compact organization of the 
college men usually succeeded. It was a system of promotion from the 
college halls to those of the Legislature, and very often it took place 
in the year of graduation. : 
The results of the training at the college show this political tendency 
in another way. Nearly all the men in the State who have been prom- 
inent in politics have for a time attended the college classes. Of the 
men in active politics in 1888, both United States Senators and two 
out of the seven Congressmen have been connected with the college as 
students. Of the prominent politicians in the past who‘have attracted 
attention outside the State, probably all but one were students in 
Columbia. John ©. Calhoun received his diploma from Yale, but 
George McDuffie, William C. Preston, and Hugh 8. Legaré were grad- 
uates of the State College. 
A strong tendency to politics was necessarily given by the presidents. 
Cooper meddled with politics, as he did with everything else; Barn- 
well and Preston had been United States Senators; while Thornwell

was a power in politics, though never holding office. Men prominent 
in politics, law, medicine, and theology have been trained there, but 
none in literature are to be compared with them in station. ‘After all, 
how many of our hundreds of American colleges can boast the name of 
even one man of great literary genius?” ' College professors have been 
sent out from there, but their reputation has not been so great as that 
of their classmates in other callings. But the college filled a need in the 
State. The population was neither manufacturing nor commercial, but 
agricultural. Technical training was not called for, but orators and 
statesmen were demanded. Training necessary for politicians and for 
the administration of the government was needed, and the college 
supplied it. I

alumni has ever been issued, but a numerical list of them has been

Deduct five holders of degrees in preceding years, and the number of different’ 
graduates as A. B., M. D., and LL. B., from 1868 to 1873, inclusive, was 55. 
In October, 1873, the University opened under new management, with colored 
students only, and so continued until July 1, 1877. ‘There is reason to suppose that 
the institution had no final exercises in June, 1877. 
A College of Agriculture and Mechanics was established on the grounds of the Uni- 
versity at Columbia, opening in October, 1880. The course for graduation was one 
of three years. It sent out, however, no graduates, and was absorbed by the South 
Carolina College in July, 1882. 
South Carolina College reopened October, 1882. The intermediate class of the 
College of Agriculture and Mechanics were allowed to take their diplomas after one 
year’s study, forming the class of 1883. The record from that time up to 1887 is given 
in the following table:

Owing to the lack of an alumni catalogue, the subsequent life of only 
a small number of the graduates is known. Out of a partial list of one 
hundred and fifty-six, there were eighty lawyers, thirty-two members of

the State House of Representatives, four members of the Confederate 
States House of Representatives, and seventeen members of the State 
Senate. Out of the whole number there were twenty-two Governors of 
States, of whom seventeen presided over South Carolina, and the others 
over Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, and Virginia. At one time three 
successive terms, and at another four successive terms, in the execu- 
tive office were filled by her alumni. Since the memorable campaign 
of 1876, four of the five chief executives were graduates of the college, 
while the fifth, Hugh 8S. Thompson, late Assistant Secretary of the U.S. 
Treasury, and now a member of the Civil Service Commission, was from 
the Citadel Academy. Eight lieutenant-governors have also received 
their diplomas at Columbia. Fourteen United States Senators have 
attended her classes, of whom all but three went from South Carolina, 
these three being from Alabama, Texas, and Virginia. Thirty-nine 
Members of Congress received the whole or a part of their collegiate 
training there, of whom twenty-eight represented the State, the others 
being from Alabama, Texas, Georgia, North Carolina, and Virginia. In 
the Thirty-third and Thirty-fourth Congresses both the Senators and four 
of the six Congressmen at some time had been on the roll of the college. 
In the Forty-sixth, Forty-seventh, Forty-eighth, and Forty-ninth Con- 
gresses, both the Senators and three of the Representatives had at- 
tended the college, while a fourth Representative in the two latter 
Congresses was a graduate of the Citadel Academy. Thirty-three 
judges and chancellors of South Carolina and adjacent States have 
been trained within her walls. Among them were three chief-justices 
and three associate justices of the Supreme Court of South Carolina, 
including the present chief-justice. Fifteen presidents of colleges 
point to her as their alma mater, of whom three presided over the in- 
stitution at Columbia, including J. M. McBryde, its present progressive 
head. There were also thirty-nine professors in the various colleges in 
South Carolina and adjoining States. Five bishops of the Methodist 
and Episcopal Churches and fifteen brigadiers in the Confederate serv- 
ice were also trained there, with nine members of the Federal and Con-' 
federate Governments. The State government of South Carolina is 
also indebted to the college for fourteen of her officers at different times. 
The fullness of the list of lawyers and politicians is the strongest tes- 
timony as to the tendency of the training at the college. To this long 
list of distinguished public men may be added James L. Petigru, Dr. 
J. Marion Sims, and the eminent botanist, H. W. Ravenel. 
  
1This eminent botanist died July 17, 1887. His researches in the department of 
phenogamous and cryptogamous plants were more complete and original than those 
of any other investigator in the country, and place him primus inter pares in a State 
which has produced such botanists as Garden, Walter, McBryde, Elliot, Porcher, and 
Gibbes. His published works have been chiefly in the form of monographs, and 
attracted much attention in the scientific world. His herbarium is a very valuable 
collection, especially in the class fungi, and would greatly enrich the cabinet of any 
university or scientific institution. 
   
-P-A-G-E-190
  166 HIGHER EDUCATION IN SOUTH CAROLINA. 
Of the men in public life, George McDuffie probably reached the 
highest rank. He and W. ©. Preston were room-mates at college, and 
he was looked on as the Demosthenes of the State as Preston was con- 
sidered the Cicero, Of George McDuffie the following incident was re- 
lated by J. H. Thornwell, at the Yale alumni dinner in 1852: ‘On one 
occasion, while Mr. McDuffie was a member of the Legislature, after he 
had made one of his splendid speeches, the question of the college 
eame up. The venerable Judge Huger, then a member of the House, 
rose and said, in his peculiarly slow and emphatic style: ‘Mr. Speaker, 
if the South Carolina College had done nothing, sir, but produce that 
man, she would have amply repaid the State for every dollar that the 
State has ever expended, or ever will expend, upon her’ The appeal 
was irresistible; opposition was disarmed ; and every year, sir, we re- 
ceived nearly $25,000 from a small State and from a poor,people.”! 
After graduation he read law, and settled in one of the upper counties 
of the State. In one of his earliest cases he was very badly beaten by 
an insignificant Jawyer. He removed after this to Edgefield County, 
and came into notice by his withering denunciation in court of the per- 
secutors of an old widow. His practice now grew very rapidly, and he 
soon entered politics. Inthe United States House of Representatives 
he made his reputation by a speech on the tariff question. The debate 
had lasted for several days and the opponents of the tariff were get- 
ting the worst of the argument. In the midst of great noise and 
confusion consequent on the fine effort of a protectionist, McDuffie 
rose in his seat, and with a countenance of great excitement, loudly 
struck his clenched fist against his desk several times. This unusual 
gesture and his stormy features gained him the attention of the House, 
and the brillianey of his speech kept it to the conclusion of his effort. 
He always had a thorough knowledge of every subject on which he 
spoke. His sentences were terse, his language plain. He always de- 
livered his speeches with an energy of voice and strength of gesture 
that never failed to command attention. When he was elected Governor 
of the State, he saw the low condition to which the college had been 
brought by Thomas Cooper, and he used his influence to revive the 
institution. It was chiefly through his active efforts that the réorgan- 
ization was brought about, and the school took a fresh start in 1834. 
This is probably the noblest and the greatest work of his life. 
JAMES H. THORNWELL. 
On the resignation of William O. Preston, Rev. James H. Thornwell 
was elected to fill his place. He was the son of poor parents living in the 
upper part of the State, and was born in 1812. In his boyhood he gave 
evidence of greatness, and several friends assisted him in gaining an 
  
1 Life of Thornwell, p. 368. 
 
-P-A-G-E-191
SOUTH CAROLINA COLLEGE. 167 
education. He entered the Junior class of the South Carolina College, 
and graduated with the highest honors in 1831. When not quite 
twenty-five he was elected a professor, and retained this college con- 
nection with few intervals for nearly twenty years. During his course 
he taught logic, criticism, metaphysics, evidences of Christianity, and 
ethics. With the whole range of philosophical and ethical literature 
he was thoroughly acquainted, and would have left his contribution to 
those departments of knowledge, but for his early death. 
If not the greatest, his was certainly one of the greatest, intellects 
that the college ever trained. He strongly impressed both students 
and professors, while John ©. Calhoun regarded him as the coming man 
trom the South, and destined to take his own place in the councils of 
the nation. His classmates looked on him as a giant, and confidently 
predicted a great future for him. He easily led his class, and there was 
no man in the debating society able to cope with him. Thomas Cooper 
thought him a boy of great promise. In after life he attracted the at- 
tention of the historian, Mr. Bancroft. Ata dinner given him in New’ 
York, when Mr. Bancroft was present, the conversation turned on the con- 
struction of some passage in Aristotle. Thornwell maintained that the 
commentators had all missed the meaning, and convinced the company 
that his views were right. On his return home he received a splendid 
copy of Aristotle from Mr. Bancroft, with a Latin inscription, as “a 
testimonial of regard to the Rev. Dr. J. H. Thornwell, the most learned 
of the learned.” 
.Though he was elected president of his college, and became a power 
in State politics, a power in the Presbyterian Church, and a power 
out of it, he never met the high expectations of his friends, and never 
reached the prominence of many other graduates, including some of his 
own classmates. It may be due to the fact that he deliberately turned 
away from almost the only field for the proper exercise of great gifts at 
that time in the South, and entered the ministry, devoting “ his brilliant 
talents to writing polemic theological disquisitions.” 
His religious convictions were very deep. He was converted when 
twenty years old, and he has left a touching prayer of joy at his con- 
version, and of trust in his Saviour. The purity of his faith led him to 
oppose as unevangelical the various church boards, and the assumption 
of educational functions by the Church. He looked on the New School 
party in his denomination as an evil, and declared that “the root of the 
evil is in the secular spirit of all our ecclesiastical institutions. What 
we want is a spiritual body. * * * To unsecularize the Church 
should be the unceasing aim of all who are anxious that the ways of 
Zion should flourish.” 
As a teacher he was very thorough and analytical, but safe and con- 
servative. No new theories of philosophy or ethics drawn from the 
liberal German school ever found acceptance in his class-room. His 
influence upon the students and his reputation throughout the State 
   
-P-A-G-E-192
  168 HIGHER EDUCATION IN SOUTH CAROLINA. 
made him almost indispensable to the college. When he was professor 
under W. C. Preston, he was invited to the pastorate of the Second 
Presbyterian Church in Baltimore. He sent in his resignation, but the 
regulations of the board of trustees of the college required a year for 
it to take effect. So strongly was the president impressed with the use- 
fulness of Professor Thornwell to the college that he sought the aid of 
Dr. B. M. Palmer, a very prominent Presbyterian minister, to invoke 
the interposition of the church to prevent Thornwell’s withdrawal from 
the institution. He testified that “we cannot afford to lose Doctor 
Thornwell from the college. In the first place, he is the representative 
there of the Presbyterian Church, which embraces the bone and sinew 
of the State, without whose support the institution cannot exist. In 
the second place, he has acquired that moral influence over the students 
which is superior even to law, and his removal will take away the very 
buttresses on which the administration of the college rests.” Doctor 
Palmer submitted a paper to the Presbytery, and that body withdrew 
their consent of the previous year, and passed a resolution expressing 
their unwillingness that Doctor Thornwell skould remove beyond the 
limits of the Synod. So he remained at Columbia. 
His term as president ranks next to Preston’sin attendance. He was 
progressive and made important recommendations, and increased the 
efficiency of the institution. He recommended to the board a pension 
for one of the oldest professors, holding that as soldiers were pensioned, 
all who were disabled in the service of the State should receive this 
gift. He introduced the method of written examinations, and raised 
the entrance requirements in Greek from six books of the Hiad to ten 
books. He was also a prominent preacher in his church, having filled 
the most important pulpits in the State; and he finally resigned the 
office of president to accept a professorship in the new theological semi- 
nary at Columbia. 
He was grave and philosophical in his discourses, and appealed to the 
intellect only—never to the emotions. His reputation in his denomina- 
tion was very wide, and he was once elected moderator of the Presby- 
terian General Assembly of the United States. He was the youngest 
man who had ever held this office, being elected in the thirty-fifth year 
of his age. 
THE “BIBLE” OF THE SOUTH CAROLINA COLLEGE. 
Two men in directly opposite ways have deeply impressed themselves 
on the history of the college. Thomas Cooper represents the liberalizing, 
radical tendency, while James H. Thornwell stands for the old conserv- 
ative, orthodox views. In all discussions as to the tendency of secta- 
rian colleges, the former is brought forward by the enemies of the col- 
lege as a frightful example of state education; while its friends put 
forward the latter as the defender of a more liberal culture than the 
denominational colleges ever give. Thomas Cooper had the reputation

of being an infidel, and his lectures on “ Geology and the Pentateuch” 
nearly ruined the school, while Thornwell was a Christian, and his letter 
to Governor Manning, the “ Bible” of the college, is used now as the 
strongest bulwark against all attacks on state education. 
The college had enjoyed a monopoly of higher education in the State. 
It was the pride of the office-holding class, who opposed attempts to 
incorporate any other institution that might be arival. The ruling 
class disliked sectarianism, and when the first charter for a denomina- 
tional college was asked for, about 1839, it was declared in the House 
of Representatives that the State only should educate her sons. 
Nothing further was done until Furman University was chartered ; it 
rapidly gathered students, and the Methodists also now wanted an insti- 
tution of theirown. The State college feared first loss of patronage, and 
eventually destruction, if all the religious denominations should oppose 
it. Under these circumstances this celebrated letter of Thornwell’s on 
education in general was written to urge the superiority of state education 
over that given by sectarian schools. He clearly showed the absurdity 
of the charge that it was ‘‘a rich man’s college,” by citing cases of boys 
who spent their allin going through the course. There could be no 
‘free college” until “ such homely articles as food, raiment, and fuel be 
no longer needed.” Of course all could not be educated, but all received 
the benefit of the few who were educated. Thelight gradually radiates 
from them through all the dark labyrinths of society, and stimulates 
the masses to self-improvement. Education must be farnished either 
by the state or church, since private means are insufficient. A godless 
education he thought worse than none, but religion can be introduced _ 
through the professors, without the necessity of being taught as a sci- 
ence. The different sects combined can drive out any unclean thing 
from the college. And while state institutions without such watchful 
care may degenerate into ‘“hot-beds of atheism and impiety,” church in- 
stitutions “degenerate into hot-beds of the vilest heresy and infidelity.” 
The continued attacks on the State institution as profane and infidel in 
its tendencies, will inevitably work tomake it both. The central college 
unites all the sections into one common brotherhood, and cherishes one 
point of glory. If the various sectarian schemes should be successful, 
there will no longer be unity and the spirit of brotherhood will be de- 
stroyed. His whole argument for the State college is strongly and 
clearly stated. On other questions he showed his conservative nature. 
He was immovably opposed to the elective system, and to an extension 
of the college into a university with other departments. . In one of his, 
magazine articles he condemned the study of the sciences as a means 
of discipline, holding that ‘they never reach the height, dignity, and in- 
tensity of pure thinking. * * * They should be postponed until 
they can be pursued as a matter of rational curiosity, when they become 
an amusement or relaxation from the severe demands of reflection.” 
The letter is probably the strongest argument ever put forth for the

college, and only two years ago it was re-issued, when the sectarian 
schools seemed about to make a move against the institution. 
Doctor Thornwell resigned soon after this and became editor of the 
Southern Quarterly Review, in addition to his other labors. His appli- 
cation to study was very close and his health soon gave way, and he 
sought relief in travel. When the Civil War broke out he entered into 
it with all the strength of his nature; but the excitement was too much 
for his nervous temperament, and he died in 1862. 
He left many magazine articles and sermons, and his collected writings 
form several volumes. One of his works, a small volume entitled Dis- 
courses on Truth, published in 1855, attracted the notice of Sir William 
Hamilton, who returned his “warmest acknowledgments” for a copy, 
and said, “I have read them with great interest, and no less admira- 
tion.” But he was cut off in his prime, without being able to carry out 
his plans. He intended to write a work on theology, to prepare an an- 
swer to the subtle attacks of the rationalistic school, and to lay clear 
the foundations of morals. But only a part of the first was ever com- 
pleted. 
PRESIDENT M°CAY. 
This gentleman was elected successor to Doctor Thornwell. His ad- 
ministration was very stormy, with its numerous riots and rebellions. 
He charged that the other members of the faculty did not give him 
their cordial support. During his term thetwo Le Contes were elected 
professors, and W. J. Rivers also, who prepared the sketch of South’ 
Carolina for Mr. Winsor’s Narrative and Critical History of America. 
President McCay having showed his inability to manage the students, 
there was a reorganization, and he resigned in 1857. 
JUDGE A. B. LONGSTREET. 
Judge Longstreet, the author of the famous Georgia Scenes, was an 
educator of great prominence in the South. Before being elected presi- 
dent of the South Carolina College, in 1857, he had presided over Emory 
College, the young Methodist institution in Georgia, Centenary College 
of Louisiana, and the College of Mississippi. He was elected an honor. 
ary member of the Smithsonian Institution, and was appointed a mem- 
ber of the statistical society that met in London in 1860, The family is 
widely known through the military reputation of his nephew. He re- 
mained connected with the college until it was closed by the exigencies 
of the Civil War. 
It is impossible to decide fully on his administration, as the excite- 
ment of the approaching conflict had its effect on the institution. But 
under him, for the third time inits history, the attendance of the college 
reached two hundred. Like their fathers, the students entered hotly 
into the coming struggle. They testified their ardent patriotism by 
forming a military company for drill, and by refusing to wear northern-

made cloth. When the State seceded they arrayed themselves in 
coarse, cheap southern-made goods, and, as there was not enough of 
one kind for all, they varied the suits and presented a “ ring-streaked 
and striped” appearance. When Charleston was threatened the corps 
of cadets, composed of students, in defiance of the authority of the 
faculty, repaired to its defence. The excitement of the latter half 
of the year 1861 was too great for them to pursue their stndies 
quietly in the college halls, and they offered their services to the State 
for active duty in Virginia, and several of the professors soon followed. 
The seats were empty, the halls deserted, and the college was closed. 
The buildings were utilized for a hospital by the Confederate authori- 
ties under the stress of circumstances.’ It was useless to open the col- 
lege, at any rate since the conscription would cover the large majority 
of the students that might offer for entrance, All the professors that 
could take active part in life entered the service of their State, while 
the others remained near the college. 
When Columbia was burned the college was saved, and in June, 
1865, the general in command requested the college to resume its work. 
The board of trustees met and appointed a time for the exercises to 
begin. But in December the Legislature converted the college into a 
university. 
In thus sketching the life of each president, it is not to be understood 
that they alone of the faculty were worthy of mention.. But the presi- 
dents had much to do in shaping the policy and work of the institution, 
and were especially influential in directing the tendency of the train- 
ing. But of all the men ever connected with the institution, one stands 
pre-eminent in scholarship; and it seems unjust that he never obtained 
the prize that his labors and reputation so well deserved, and for which 
he was ambitious. 
FRANCIS LIEBER. \ 
It is the glory of the South Carolina College that one of the great 
publicists of the world should have done within her precincts the work 
on which his fame will rest. The work that Francis Lieber did before 
coming to Columbia was superseded many years ago. The work he 
did after leaving there is mainly supplementary to the principles he 
laid so broad and deep during his twenty years of quiet scholarly re- 
treat. He chafed over the restraints of the “ peculiar institution,” railed 
at the narrowness of the Calvinists, sighed over his literary “ exile,” 
and mourned for the intellectual companionship of the North; but yet 
he will be remembered by the three works that he wrote and published 
while at the South. 
Born in 1800, in Berlin, he was hardly old enough to carry a musket 
on the field of Waterloo to aid in throwing off the French yoke. His 
youthful hatred of wrong and injustice marked the course of his life and

furnished the feeling for some of his warmest letters while in Columbia, 
Although he was wounded in the battle of Namur and crippled for life. 
his ardor for civil freedom grew stronger as he approached manhood, 
Indeed Lieber was arrested on suspicion of entertaining revolutionary 
sentiments. After remaining in prison some months, he was released 
without a trial and expelled from Prussia. He finally took his degrees 
at Jena in 1820, and attempted to prosecute his studies at Halle. Here 
he was watched so closely that it became irksome to him, and he es- 
caped from the country after much trouble, and made his way to Greece, 
to assist that land in its struggle against the Turks. On the failure 
of his efforts, he returned to Rome and made the acquaintance of the 
eminent historian, Niebuhr, who befriended him in many ways. He at 
length returned to Prussia on the assurance of the King that he should 
not be molested. Immediately on his arrival he was thrown into prison, 
kept there several months on the old charges, and only released at the 
pressing solicitations of Niebuhr. 
Although he spent possibly a year in a German prison, he never re- 
gretted the enforced solitude and the time for solid work. He was not 
idle, and during his last imprisonment he composed a volume of poems, 
Wein und Wonne Lieder, which was published at Berlin. While he un- 
doubtedly entertained republican sentiments, his wonderful insight is 
seen in his declaration in 1820 that political unity was the chief need 
for Germany, and that it would be obtained only through a revolutionary 
King. 
He left his native land and went to London in 1825, where he stayed 
for more than a year, the hardest time of his life, “doing uncongenial 
work, and physically laboring like an American army mule.” In 1827, 
with warm recommendations from his best friend, Niebuhr, he came to 
America, his adopted country. From his arrival until his appointment 
to South Carolina College in 1835, he did various things for a living, 
from managing a gymnasium and swimming school to editing an ency- 
clopedia. The latter was a work very much needed at that time in 
America, and was very successful, as it was the only one to treat of 
America especially. He also translated French and German works, 
prepared a plan of education for Girard College, and published his 
Letters to a Gentleman in Germany. During this time he lived for a 
while in Boston, and there made friends of such distinguished men as 
Story, Channing, Pickering, Sullivan, Ticknor, Prescott, and others. 
He made an attempt to get a foreign mission, and although he was 
strongly endorsed, he was unsuccessful. This would have been greatly 
to his tastes, as he could have renewed his European associations. It 
was a painful disappointment to him to have his “castles in the air 
abort Europe” come tumbling about his ears, for though he had no 
“homesickness for Germany,” he longed “for Europe, for science, and 
art.”

SOUTH CAROLINA COLLEGE—FRANCIS LIEBER. 173 
APPOINTMENT TO SOUTH CAROLINA COLLEGE. 
During these years he toiled unceasingly to meet the needs of a grow- 
ing family, and anxiously waited for “the time to write on subjects 
which have long occupied my mind.” He divided his years between 
Boston, New York, and Philadelphia. Boston was the most congenial 
to him, and though New York was a “hundred times more stirring, en- 
couraging, enterprising than Philadelphia,” yet it was in the latter place 
that he made a friend partly through whose influence he was enabled 
“to find at last a fixed spot.” Mr. Nicholas Biddle was at this time 
president of the United States Bank at Philadelphia, and another gentle- 
man, Hon. William Drayton, of South Carolina, was residing there. 
Judge Story in Washington was of course acquainted with the influen- 
tial men from South Carolina, and it was through the kind influence of 
these gentlemen, but chiefly of the first two, that Lieber was induced to 
apply for a place in the faculty. The college was to be reorganized after 
the liberal but disastrous policy of the bold Thomas Cooper, and Colonel 
Drayton furnished Lieber with letters to Governors Hamilton and 
Hayne. Both these gentlemen interested themselves to procure him a 
place. 
Lieber did not want to go South; the scholarly associations and con- 
genial companionship were lacking, and he, an uncompromising, life- 
long advocate of liberty, was forced to be politic on the slave question. 
On February 28, 1835, he wrote to his friend Mittermaier: ‘“ Yet Iam 
aware how much I must give up in accepting the situation. I must bid 
farewell to all that is most precious and dear to me, and shall be com- 
pelled to liveina slave State; yet I shall there havea settled sphere of 
activity, and shall be able to exert my influence in the right direction. 
It will give me the means of supporting my family, and the time to write 
on subjects which have long occupied my *mind.” 
On June 5, 1835, he was unanimously elected professor of history and 
political economy, and afterward political philosophy was added to his 
department. Henow entered upon the work of teaching that he was to 
follow for nearly forty years. He had had no experience in instruct- 
ing large classes before he undertook the work at Columbia. He was, 
however, fitted for the task by his comprehensive knowledge and felicity 
of illustration. He aimed to make the subject interesting and attractive 
to the students. 
LIEBER AS A TEACHER. 
“ His method of teaching,” as well described by Hon. R. M. Thayer,! 
“was such as to make the subject attractive in the highest degree to 
his students, and they thoroughly understood everything they learned. 
He never read lectures, but expounded his subject in terse, familiar 
language, and impressed them by copious and happy illustrations. At 
1 Lieber’s Miscellaneous Writings, Vol. I, pp. 34-5.

the end of every recitation he gave out what for the next time they 
ought to read collaterally, and what peculiar subjects or persons they 
ought to study, besides the lesson. He caused them to read poetry 
and fiction, in connection with history, in order to see how great writers 
had conceived great characters. He relied much upon the blackboard. 
To one he would give chronology, to another geography, to another 
names, to another battles. Four large blackboards were in constant 
use at the same time, and often a considerable part of the floor be- 
sides. All names were required to be written down, sometimes sixty 
or seventy by one student, with a word or two showing that the writer 
knew what they meant. All places were pointed out on large maps 
and globes. All definitions were written on the blackboard, in order 
that there might be no mistake. Foreign names were always written 
on the blackboard behind him. He always appointed a lesson, but the 
students when they came did not know whether they were to recite or 
to listen to a lecture, so that they always. had to be prepared. Notes 
of his lectures were to be taken, and he required each student to have 
a blank book, wherein they must enter titles of books and subjects to 
be studied in later life—such as were necessary for an educated man; 
and he was particular in requiring this blank book to have a firm cover. 
He used to say that books were like men, of little use without a stiff 
back.” 
He believed fully in illustrating history as much as possible, and 
taught by object lessons. He ornamented his rooms with portraits and 
busts of the most famous characters of history. There might be seen 
ranged around ‘his room Homer, Demosthenes, Socrates, Cicero, Shake- 
speare, Milton, Kant, Goethe, Luther, Washington, Alexander Ham- 
ilton, Humboldt, William Penn, the illustrious trio—Webster, Clay, 
and Caihoun—and two eminent Carolinians of his day, McDuffie and 
Preston. He was no musty delver in mere antiquity, but a close 
student of current matters and living men. He believed in the power 
of a motto, a maxim, or a sentence, placed so that the eye could fall on 
itat any time. In his vestibule he had painted: 
Patria cara. 
Carior Libertas. 
Veritas carissima. 
One day in speaking to his Juniors, Seneca’s words came to him: 
Non schole discimus, sed vite. He took this idea and had a tablet made 
with these words: Non scholew sed vite ; vite utrique (“Not for the 
school but for life; the life here and hereafter”). ‘This, tablet he fast- 
ened to Washington’s bust immediately over his head, so that the class 
faced it. 
In his first report to the trustees he asked for an appropriation of 
two hundred dollars for maps, and fifty dollars for English news- 
 
-P-A-G-E-201
  
SOUTH CAROLINA COLLEGE—FRANCIS LIEBER. 175 
papers, ‘ which I find indispensably necessary, both in order to keep up 
with the history of the day, and in particular for my lectures on the 
current events of our own times.” He declared that his room was so 
small “that maps and blackboards cannot be placed in the same room, 
and yet each is as important as the other.” The trustees decided ad- 
versely on the request for the maps, but granted him the newspapers on 
the ground that they would make his lectures more useful to the class. 
But as a disciplinarian, unfortunately for him, he was a failure. He 
was testy, impulsive, easily angered, and never quite understood the 
spirit of the American boy. His students all respected him, and admired 
his talents, but at times they tried his temper to such an extent that the 
mollifying influence of the president was necessary. A student in class 
one day made him angry, and he threw down his book and left the room. 
His high-spirited scholars felt their dignity wounded and “ boycotted” 
him, refusing to return until Lieber apologized. The president took the 
matter in hand and it was several days before the difficulty was “ad- 
justed.” : 
Many amusing anecdotes are related of his encounters with the boys, 
in some of which he discomfited them, while in others he was himself 
discomfited. On one occasion he asked what was the religion of the 
Jews, and ou being answered ‘“ Mohammedanism,” he was so angered 
that he tried to have the feilow driven from college for stupidity. Be- 
ing absent from college for some time, he turned over his record book 
to another professor to make out the grade of the students under him. 
Against one boy’s name he had marked ‘ fool,” “fool,” “ fool,” every 
time he was called up. A candidate for entrance into the Freshman 
class offered himself to Lieber for examination. ‘‘ Mr. W., where is the 
Pacific Ocean?” “You must think I am a booby, sir.” ‘“ Very well, 
sir, what was the name of Ulysses’ dog?” The student very prudently 
chose to answer the first question. 
At another time he asked the class: ‘“‘ What is Bologna noted for?” 
Getting no reply, he himself answered, ‘“‘ For professors and sausages.” 
This of course provoked alaugh. “Oh, gentlemen, you need not laugh. 
Wherever dere are professors and sausages, dere you will find students 
and hogs.” 
But there are some good anecdotes at Lieber’s expense still current in 
college circles. In those years the rules were very strict, and required 
the professors to rush out on the campus and arrest any students found 
there after a certain hour at night. One dark night a nimble-footed 
student was going to his room laden with a turkey and other stolen 
plunder, when Lieber, hearing the noise, suddenly rushed out and gave 
chase. The student took this opportunity to play a prank on him, and 
led him around the campus in the darkness upon a convenient pile of 
brick. Lieber thought he had his prey, and made a wild, ineffectual 
grab at the flying coat-tails as the boy lightly ran over the pile, and the 
next instant the professor came down heavily on all-fours on the rough 
   
-P-A-G-E-202
  176 HIGHER EDUCATION IN SOUTH CAROLINA. 
bricks. The youngster hid himself near by, and solemnly maintained 
afterward that the “ Walking Encyclopedia” ‘slowly rose, vigorously 
rubbed his shins, and exclaimed, sotto voce, ‘Mein Gott! All dis for two 
tousand dollars!” 
Itis said that with all his command of the English language he never 
learned to pronounce the “th.” In spite of his differences with the 
students, he sometimes gave them very fatherly advice on matters not 
at all connected with the regular work. One of his students was a very 
modest fellow, and had an unfortunate habit of blushing without much 
reason for it. Lieber one day took him aside and very earnestly said to 
him, “Mr. A, you must cure yourself of this bad habit of blushing. 
In Europe everybody blushes; men, women, children—all blush. But 
in America, nobody blushes unless he has something to blush for.” 
HIS COURSE OF STUDY. 
He was the first full professor of his branches the college ever had, 
and probably he gave more advanced courses in his “ exile” than were 
given at the time in the large, wealthy institutions of the North. In 
1837 he reported to the board that the Freshman class had studied 
ancient history (Tytler’s) to the Peloponnesian War; the Sophomores 
to Alexander the Great; the Juniors in modern history were studying 
German and French history, and the struggle of the Netherlands against 
Spain; while after this they would take up English history to the ac- 
cession of JamesI. During the year he had lectured to the Senior class 
on political economy, merely touching on commerce. He varied his 
course at times. In the following year the Sophomore class studied 
ancient Greek and Roman history to the Punic War, while the Juniors 
devoted their time to the Middle Ages, and heard lectures on the Spanish 
and Portuguese discoveries and the Reformation. In political economy 
he first gave the introduction to the subject, and after finishing the 
subject of revenue would take up that of commerce. His text-book in 
history was Tytler’s Universal History, and in political economy he 
used Say’s. His annotated copy is preserved at Baltimore. 
But he never confined himself to any book. His stores of knowledge 
were always full, and he poured them out profusely. The students 
could at almost any time draw out of him a profound philosophical lect- 
ure. He never had set lectures, and never used notes in his talks to 
the class. When a passage, a sentence, or a word arose that called up 
a train of thought, he opened his vast storehouse and the students 
listened with interest and wonder. 
A mnost interesting feature, and one that many teachers cannot at- 
tempt for want of sufficiently broad knowledge, was his happy ‘‘paral- 
lels” between ancient and modern history and politics, and his appli- 
cations to current events. In his report of 1839 he says: “I have 
continued Roman history to the Junior class, and endeavored to draw 
parallels in modern history and politics.” With his universal and exact 
 
-P-A-G-E-203
  
SOUTH .CAROLINA COLLEGE—FRANCIS LIEBER. 177 
knowledge, nothing could be better adapted to impress on students 
the continuity of history and the unity of the human family. 
But his ultimate aim in all his teaching is probably best described in 
the dedicatory epistle “to his former pupils,” which introduces his Civil 
Liberty and Self-Government. ‘“ When you were members of this in- 
stitution I led you through the history of man, of rising and of ebbing 
civilization, of freedom, despotism, avd anarchy. I have taught you 
how men are destined to be producers and exchangers, how wealth is 
gathered and lost, and how, without it, there can be no progress and 
no culture. I have studied, with many of you, the ethics of states and 
of political man. You can bear me witness that I have endeavored to 
convince you of man’s inextinguishable individuality, and of the or- 
ganic nature of society ; that there is no right without a parallel duty, 
no liberty without the supremacy of the law, and no high destiny with- 
out earnest perseverance—that there can be no greatness without self- 
denial. Through you my life and name are linked to the Republic, 
and it seems natural that I should dedicate to you a work intended to 
complete that part of my Political Ethies which touches more especially 
on liberty. You will take it as the gift of a friend, and will allow it 
kindly to remind you of that room where you were accustomed to sit be- 
fore your teacher with the busts of Washington, Socrates, Shakespeare, 
and other laborers in the vineyard of humanity, looking down upon 
us.” 
Col. C. C. Jones, author of the History of Georgia, who was astudent 
under Lieber nearly forty years ago, bears “ willing testimony to the 
truth of the statements contained in that generous dedication,” and fur- 
ther says: “To my apprehension never was instructor more painstak- 
ing, luminous, or able. It was a genuine privilege to sit upon his 
benches and learn at his lips.) * * * The text-book furnished only a 
meagre theme for his daily discourses. Treasures of expansion, illustra- 
tion, and philosophical deduction were evoked from his great storehouse 
of knowledge and reflection. His classes were always full. He claimed 
and received the closest attention. * * * His intercourse with the 
students both within and without the lecture-room was manly and 
pleasant. The relation between teacher and pupil was maintained ata 
high standard, and he evinced, on all occasions, a special pleasure in 
enkindling a desire for exact and liberal knowledge in his department, 
in satisfying all inquiries suggested by the topics under discussion, and 
in directing the attention of his scholars to the highest sources of in- 
formation. Above all, his delight was to lead the mind of the learner 
to a clear comprehension of the genuine philosophy of the event, and to 
inculeate the cardinal principles which lay at the foundation of civil, 
religious, and political liberty, ethics, public morals, labor and prop- 
erty, international law, and the kindred subjects comprehended in his 
department. In my eyes he was a wonderful instructor. I delighted 
to sit under his teachings, and I have never ceased to remember with 
11406—No, 3——12

gratitude the suggestions, the knowledge, and theencouragement which 
fell from his lips.”! 
But he was a believer in other stimulus for the students besides the 
teacher’s enthusiasm. He recommended the adoption of the prize sys- 
tem, and advocated the bestowal of handsome editions of the classics 
on the best students, but required the system to be based on general 
excellence, so as to prevent a one-sided development. In his words, 
“Tam far from being hostile to emulation, if guarded and restricted.” 
He probably felt the need of such extraneous stimulation for the stu- 
dent when he said in his report of 1838: ‘About half of the whole num- 
ber study well, earnestly, in my department. Part of the other half 
do, I believe, about as much as they can without exerting themselves.” 
“But bis offer of three nines (the maximum mark) to any one of the 
Freshman class who would find his glasses, that he had accidentally 
lost on his way to the class-room, can hardly be considered as a pre- 
mium on scholarship. 
LIFE AT COLUMBIA. 
While Lieber was successful as a teacher, and won the love and ad- 
miration of his pupils in spite of his testiness, and had the respect of 
his associates and the trustees, and the friendship of the leading men 
and the confidence of a large number of admirers through the State, yet 
his life there was not very happy. His lot in the North had been a hard 
one, as he had lived there the life of a literary hack, going from city 
to city, and he came South from sheer necessity, to get food, clothing, 
and shelter for his family and time to.write out his political philosophy. 
He bluntly admitted that, though “I must bid farewell to all that is 
most precious and dear to me, yet * * * it will give me the means 
of supporting my family.” Even after having been there nearly eigh- 
teen years, he wrote to Hillard, in a letter of April, 1854: “ William C. 
Preston wrote home from the North last year, ‘They cannot under- 
stand ‘here how we can keep Lieber in our parts.” The matter is very 
simple; because they give me the means to support my family.” 
When he came to Columbia he is said to have been very needy. As 
the youngest professor, according to the rule, he had the last choice of 
houses, and was forced to take a very small one. On thesudden death 
of Professor Knott, ‘Lieber:petitioned the board for the vacant house, 
“because Ihave but four rooms. My study, in which I spend all my 
time that I am not occupied with college duties, is close to the nursery, 
so that I can hear every word spoken init. I would never have mentioned 
this circumstance except when an opportunity offered to obtain a more 
convenient one. * * * f trust Ineed not assure you that it.is pain- 
ful to write on so apparently trifling matters to the trustees, but a man’s 
1¥rom a private letter to Dr, H. B, Adams, from which the author is permitted to

house is after all no trifling matter, especially not that of a literary 
man.” It is pleasant to note that he got the larger house. 
His life there was wnfreundlich—uncongenial. Not quite three weeks 
after his arrival in Columbia he could record in his journal: ‘“ Home- 
less! ah, why cannot I live in peace somewhere where I know I shali 
remain, where I can feel at home and join in the life of my community! 
Here in the South we cannot live forever; that is certain.” 
He missed the intellectual associations of the North, his companions 
to whom he wrote so warmly.!| Within a few days after coming South 
he records in his journal: “I feel how far I am removed from active, 
progressive, and intellectual life.” 
He made warm friends there, and was heartily weleomed by many of 
the best people. He formed a very high opinion of William C. Pres- 
ton, and records in his diary, shortly after his arrival, ‘‘ Preston I like 
much. He isa thinking man anda gentleman.” At other times he 
speaks of the kindness of the Prestons, Notts, Hamptons, La Bordes, 
and others. But they were not interested in the deep questions that 
he loved to discuss. 
The Calvinists in the State also opposed Lieber’s liberal views. His 
ideas were not extreme, like Cooper’s, but he could never accept the 
literal interpretations of some of the churches. Before he moved South 
he was informed that “the religionists represent me positively as an 
infidel, and some as an ‘infidel in disguise !’” The attacks continued, 
and atter he had been there fifteen years he found it necessary to answer 
the charges made against him for “teaching unbiblical doctrines.” He 
wrote a letter of condolence to one of his colleagues who was charged 
with the same offence, in which he declares that the Bible, “ the greatest 
truth of all,” “starids, and will stand, in spite of the ignorance and 
foolishness of some of its friends.” 
He never ceased wishing to get away from the South. He looked 
forward to the time when he could leave, even if he had to give up his 
line of work. Within a few weeks after reaching his Southern home, 
he wrote to Sumner: “1 would rather go to Alabama and become a 
planter, make a competency in five years, and then become a writer.” He 
had no desire to become one of the Southerners. It was too much of 
a“solitude” for him. He writes in his diary the third year after settling 
there: “ Life does not touch us; the world moves on, and we are left 
behind. I cannot remain here forever.” 
With Judge Story at their head, his friends tried to establish a pro- 
fessorship for him in, the Cambridge Law School, and tke attempt 
seemed likely to be entirely successful, when Story suddenly died.   
    9, he writes in his diary: ‘‘ Now, 1On the appearance of his Political Ethics, in 1$ 
I have not one, not even one, here who sympathizes with me, still less one from whom 
I could derive stirring knowledge in my sphere. My book, as it is b e the public, 
I have been obliged to spin solitarily out of my brain, as the spider spins its cobweb, 
without one cheering consolation, one word of friendly advice—in utter mental iso- 
lation,”

Toward the last he gave up the hope of being removed, and came 
to rely on himself to do the work. With his friends he spoke and wrote 
jocularly of the “ Lieber Emancipation Society,” that was finally to get 
him away from the place which “never was our home,” though he lived 
there nearly twenty-two years. In the midst of all his anxiety to get 
away, he could still be humorous. In one of his very serious letters he 
wound up with the request, ‘“Take me away from this land, where the 
skies are so blue and the negroes so black!” Although just two years 
before leaving there he could write, “I shall soon have spent twenty 
years in this region. It would he folly to speak of anything after that, 
except the misspent life.” 
Yet it must be remembered that this “region,” this ‘ solitude,” this 
“exile,” this “ barren loneliness,” this “ absolute desert,” this “Siberia,” 
made him the man that he is. It was here that he could find time to 
record those weighty thoughts. He never found time in the North be- 
fore going South, though he was there seven years, and he never obtained 
the time there until he cut himself loose from the South. 
HIS WRITINGS AT COLUMBIA. 
It was at Columbia, as has been said, that his great works were pro- 
duced. The germs of one of them were probably in his mind before go- 
ing there, but the others were entirely the product of this scholastic 
leisure. His Manual of Political Ethics came out in 1838, Legal and 
Political Hermeneutics in 1839, and Civil Liberty and Self-Govern- 
ment, probably his best known work, in 1853. 
Itis not within the scope of this paper to attempt a characterization 
or an outline of these philosophical productions. Lieber’s friend and 
biographer says of them: ‘‘They were positive additions of the great- 
est importance to the knowledge previously possessed upon these sub- 
jects. They embodied in a profound, original, and comprehensive system 
the principles upon which human society and government repose. They 
traced to their true sources all the social and governmental relations, 
and expounded their reasons, their history, their distinctions, and their 
philosophic significance and results, with a clearness of exhibition, a 
force of argument, a wealth of learning, a power of illustration, and a 
high moral purpose, never before seen in the same field.” ! 
These works attracted great attention, not only in this country, but 
throughout Europe, and were very quickly translated into German. 
They drew flattering words from W. H. Prescott, Chancellor Kent, and 
Rufus Choate; from Hallam and Creasy; and from Von Mohl, Mitter- 
maier, and Garelli; Harvard conferred on him the degree of LL. D., 
and the French Institute elected him and Archbishop Whately corre- 
sponding members.on the same day; while the King of Prussia offered 
him a chair in one of his universities.

SOUTH CAROLINA COLLEGE—FRANCIS LIEBER. 181 
He also wrote many short newspaper and magazine articles while in 
Columbia, and delivered several addresses, one of the most famous of 
these being at Greenville in 1851. His essays on labor and property, 
his inaugural address on the Study of History and Political Economy, 
the First Constituents of Civilization, the Character of the Gentleman, 
the Necessity of Continued Self-Education, and the History and Use 
of Athenzeums, were all brought out during “this golden time of scho- 
lastic leisure and scholarly production.” 
HIS POSITION ON PARTISAN QUESTIONS. 
It has been said of Lieber that ‘‘He was thoroughly American in all 
his feelings—as much so as if he had been born here.” In no respect 
did he show his American feeling more than in his love for the Union. 
He believed in the preservation of this first, foremost, and all the time. 
In a man of his affectionate nature, no stronger language to indicate 
his devotion to country could be used than the following in a letter 
to Hillard, December 29, 1849: ‘I love my wife—God knows it—yet 
iknow I should not feel her loss more than the breaking up of the 
Union.” 
But he never allowed himself to become a partisan in the discussion 
then so all-absorbing in the State. Although the college was so closely 
connected with the politics of the State, it is to the credit of Lieber 
that he did not use his position to influence the young men under him on 
a partisan question. He could truthfully testify : “ In my position, asa 
servant of the State, in a public institution of education, I have im- 
posed upon myself the duty of using my influence with the young 
neither one way nor the other in this discussion. I have scrupulously 
adhered to it in all my teaching and intercourse. There isnot aman or 
youth that can -gainsay this. But I am aman and a citizen, and as 
such I have aright, or the duty, as the case may be, to speak my mind 
and my inmost convictions on solemn occasions before my fellow-citi- 
zens, and I have thus not hesitated to put down these remarks. Take 
them, gentlemen, for what they may be worth. They are, at any rate, 
sincere and fervent ; and whatever judgment others may pass upon them, 
or whatever attacks may be levelled against them, no one will be able to 
say that they can have been made to promote any individual advan- 
tages. God save the Commonwealth! God save the common land!”! 
In his family, as in many others, was illustrated the cruelty of a civil 
war, when two of his sons held commissions in the Northern army, 
while his eldest and probably most promising one laid down his life 
for the cause of secession—a cause that his father had so unceasingly 
opposed through life.

  182 HIGHER EDUCATION IN SOUTH CAROLINA. 
LIEBER AND THE PRESIDENCY OF THE COLLEGE. 
Lieber went South unwillingly as into exile, and it was but natural 
that the people there should feel that he was not,“ one of them.” He 
was not fanatical about their institutions, but the whole atmosphere 
was uncongenial. He was bold, and incapable of flattery or hypocrisy. 
He was a great scholar, and whatever else may be said of the people 
themselves, it was pleasant to them to have such a man in their midst. — 
But Francis Lieber clearly read the signs of the times, and understood 
his exact position. There can be no doubt that he wanted a more pub- 
lic place than that of professor. As such, he came in contact with the 
students, and could hope to influence the public through them alone, 
and indirectly, through his teachings. But the office of president was 
one of the most prominent and public in the State. It was considered 
almost as high as that of Governor or United States Senator. The 
college was practically a school of polities, and the president was 
brought into direct contact with the affairs of the State. An election 
to the office was as important, and attracted as much attention, as an 
election to the Governor’s or a Senator’s place. Nominations were made 
in the public press, and sides were taken as in a popular contest. The 
presidents had nearly all been politicians, and it is significant that the 
most successful ones were influential in public affairs. 
But to get this coveted honor Lieber had to be something more than 
merely politic, and he recognized it. As early as 1842, he recorded in 
his diary : “‘ But nothing would make me more one of them, and give 
mne greater renown, than a pamphlet written for the South, especially 
in favor of slavery. I would sooner cut off my right hand! HadIdone 
all this, I doubt not I would have had one of the best chances of being 
elected president of the college.” 
But social life softened his indignation, and familiarity with the sys- 
tem widened his knowledge. The people were hospitable and made 
much of him, and the climate with its ‘incomparable sunsets” was 
pleasant to him. He wanted the office of president, and had to become 
more prudent on slavery. But on other questions he did not go far 
enough for one side, and went too far for the other. There could be 
no unanimity of sentiment for him, and he allied himself with the weaker 
party. He could be silent on slavery, make no attacks on it, even en- 
dorse it by buying a slave, but he was too manly to swallow his indig- 
nation and defend it as “a good, a positive good ” in itself. But his 
bold, outspoken utterances on secession, his outbursts against Calvin- 
ism, his connecting Calvinism with Know-Nothingism, his attendance 
on the Episcopal church instead of the Presbyterian, his abhorrence of 
the doctrine of future punishment—all these, combined with a suspicion 
on the part of some that he was inclined to abolitionism, and his failure 
as a disciplinarian, defeated him for the office upon which his heart was 
so firmly set.

SOUTH CAROLINA COLLEGE. 183 
ITis candidacy was made a question of politics, and the papers through 
the State were treating it as they did political questions. The move- 
ment for him was spontaneous, as he himself refused *‘ to move a finger” 
to get the office. Many of his warmest supporters were his old students, 
but many of them he never knew or heard of. This spontaneous 
uprising for him was very pleasant and grateful to Lieber, and led him 
to believe that, under proper circumstances, “I could be a man of the 
people, in the sense in which Luther was one.” All the alumni and a 
large number of the people, as far as could be judged from popular 
demonstration, and at first a majority of the trustees, wanted him elected 
president. But the outgoing president, Thornwell, a power in the 
State at that time, endorsed another professor, who was a Presbyterian, 
in the hope of thus killing off both and running a “dark horse.” But, 
to the astonishment and dismay of not only Lieber, but the other mem- 
bers of the faculty, Thornwell’s candidate was elected. He was a new 
man, not acquainted with the students, having been there only a year, 
and showed his total unfitness for the office in the two years he was 
allowed to hold it. Lieber felt very much hurt over this, not that he 
was defeated, but because “a professor unknown to the trustees and 
utterly incapable of ruling this institution has been elected, and because 
the college will go toruin!” The disappointment was too keen for him, 
and he sent in his resignation, without any prospect of getting another 
place. 
Lieber left Columbia, 8. C., in 1856, and went to Columbia College, 
New York, shortly afterward, to a professorship, which ke held until 
his death in 1872. The alumni of the institution showed that their sup- 
port of him was genuine by their resolutions of regret, conveyed to him 
by some of the most prominent men in the State. 
OTHER PROFESSORS. 
During Lieber’s connection with the school, there were also other 
teachers of prominence in the various departments, but the limits of 
this work preclude mention of more than a few. Some of them are 
to-day occupying advanced places in institutions of very hight rank. 
Charles S. Venable was for two years professor of mathemat Ue 
had been educated at Hampden-Sidney College and the University of 
Virginia, had studied for some time in Germany, and on returning 
to this country had successively filled professorships at Hampden- 
Sidney, the University of Georgia, and then at South Carolina College— 
and all this before he had reached the age of thirty. He entered the 
army on the outbreak of the War, and rose rapidly to a position on 
General Lee’s staff. After the War he was elected to a chair in the 
University of Virginia, and there prepared a series of mathematical 
text-books of high character. 
Another professor, a young man of great promise, was Robert W. 
Barnwell, who died from severe labors on the Aid Association in 1862, 
   
-P-A-G-E-214
  184 HIGHER EDUCATION IN SOUTIT CAROLINA. 
The two Le Contes, who graduated at the University of Georgia, 
were also professors there. They now hold places in the University of 
California. William J. Rivers, who wrote the early history of South 
Carolina for Mr. Winsor’s History of America, held the chair of Greek. 
There were also the two Gibbes and Ellet in science, and Nott in logie. 
Prof. James Wallace, who held the chair of mathematics from 1820 to 
1834, wrote a text-book on geometry that was one of the most complete in 
the country up to that time. He also prepared a treatise on globes, and 
one on practical astronomy. On one of his works he was engaged for 
twenty years, but it was excellent when finished. He also held a chair 
in Columbia College, and again in Georgetown College, in the District of 
Columbia. 
Besides others, whom want of space prevents mentioning, there was 
La Borde, the quaint, gentle historian of the college, whose work is 
quite uniquo in its way, being probably the only ambitious attempt of 
the sort south of the Potomac River. 
SUBSEQUENT HISTORY OF THE COLLEGE. 
‘When the mighty storm convulsed the country, the college, in com- 
mon with so many other institutions south of Mason and Dixon’s line, 
could only bow its head until the elements had spent their fury. Its 
students, and many of its professers, went to the front, and its walls 
resounded with the groans of the wounded and the sick, instead of 
the shouts and laughter of the boys. When the War closed the trus- 
tees bravely determined to take up the lines where they had fallen and 
reopen the doors again, in the midst of all the confusion and disorder 
attendant on the inauguration of a new system. The officer of the 
United States Army in command co-operated with them all that he could, 
and it was announced that tho college would again receive students. 
But it was not to do so as a college, but as a university with inde- 
pendent schools, after the style of the University of Virginia, thus 
furnishing another illustration of the overwhelming influence of Jeffer- 
son’s original mind. ‘The institution was reorganized as a university, 
witht departments of law and medicine added. In the academic de- 
partment proper most of the old professors were reinstated, while 
Robert W. Barnwell, who had restored confidence in the college after 
the disastrous administration of Thomas Cooper, was again called to 
the head of it. With the destruction of the auxiliary academies, the 
college found it necessary to lower the requirements for entrance, and 
in consequence for graduation. Unfortunately the old high standards 
have never been reached since then, though the faculty have made 
faithful efforts to do so. 
The prospects were bright ; over one hundred students ae the 
courses in spite of the revolution. But a warning was given in the re- 
organization of the board in 1869, which was followed by some resig- 
nations. The others still held on, as their lives had been spent in

connection with the school, and it was hard to give it up. But when 
the final step was taken by throwing open the doors to all without 
regard to race, the last one of the old faculty sadly bade farewell to 
the old familiar walls, and left never to return. 
The school was thrown open to the blacks, and the white students 
instantly left. The curriculum conld no longer be more than that of a 
medium high school, and even with that concession the benches were 
not filled. Scholarships were offered by the Legislature, and the stu- 
dents were practically hired to go to school. 
During the first period, until 1873, the college did good work in spite 
of the drawbacks and the confusion in the land. There were sixty-one 
degrees conferred during this period, and among the graduates were 
some young men of promise. 1t was during this time that one of the 
present members of Congress was graduated, and the present able pro- 
fessor of history and political economy in the South Carolina College 
received his diploma in these years. During the period of the negro 
attendance about twenty-three degrees were conferred. The college 
was a failure. | 
The school was closed in July, 1877, and reopened as the College of 
Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts in 1880. This college continued 
for two years, and then after some effort an appropriation was made, 
and the College of South Carolina again reopened. The whole of the 
higher education of the State was then organized under the name of 
the University of South Carolina, while the branch at Columbia re- 
tained the old name of the College of South Carolina, with a full faculty 
of arts and sciences. J. M. McBryde, a native of the State and a gen- 
tleman of educational experience, was elected president, and he has vin- 
dicated the wisdom of the choice. He was assisted by seven professors, 
and since then the college has moved on very smoothly and success- 
fully. The attendance has almost reached that before the War, and at 
one time (1884) went to two hundred and thirteen, the third highest 
figure in the history of the school, and at another to two hundred and 
two, while the average attendance for the last five years has been about 
equal to that for the whole time since the college was founded. 
LIBRARY OF THE COLLEGE. 
The library of the college contains some very rare volumes, and the 
following sketch of’ it from a report issued by the Bureau of Educa- 
tion is not inappropriate : 
“The South Carolina College, now the University of South Carolina, 
was chartered in 1801, and a library was at once begun. The first 
grant for it was made by the General Assembly in 1802, and when the 
coliege opened in 1805, about three thousand dollars, it is estimated, 
had been paid for books. In 1813 the board of trustees voted to apply

tion and foolish prejudices of the whites.

     the surplus of the tuition fund to the library. During the period from 
1813 to 1845 this amounted to $23,757. In 1823 the General Assembly 
made a grant of five thousand dollars for the benefit of the library, and 
in 1825 voted an additional five thousand dollars for the same purpose. 
In 1836 fifteen thousand dollars were appropriated for a library building 
and five thousand dollars for the purchase of books; and in 1838 an an- 
nual grant of two thousand dollars was voted for the library. During the 
period from 1836 to 1853 the grants for the library by the General As- 
sembly amounted to forty-three thousand dollars, and there was real- 
ized from the surplus tuition fund the sum of $19,374, making an aggre- 
gate of $62,374 in seventeen years. The library has reccived altogether 
from State and private sources over ninety thousand dollars. 
“Governor John Drayton, whose message to the General Assembly 
in 1801 is considered the germ of the college, was among the first, if not 
the first, to give books to the library. In 1807 he presented his own 
publications and a number of other works. In 1841 the General As- 
sembly presented a copy of the American Archives. In 1842 copies of 
the acts and resolutions of the Assembly from 1790 were presented by. 
order of the General Assembly, and have since been received annually. 
In 1844 General James H. Adams and Colonel John Lawrence Manning 
made valuable gifts of books, and the General Assembly presented Au- 
dubon’s Birds. 
“The number of volumes now in the library is about twenty-seven 
thousand, besides one thousand pamphlets. A literary society, the 
Clariosophic, connected with the college, has a library of one thousand 
two hundred and fifty volumes. 
“The college library contains a large number of rare and valuable 
books, and is especially rich in works on Egypt. The first copy of Ros- 
sellini’s Monumenti dell’ Egitto e della Nubia, ten volumes octavo, 
brought to the United States, was imported for this library. There 
are also many very old volumes, a number of them printed during the 
sixteenth century, and some dating as far back as 1480. 
“The library was built in 1841, and cost more than twenty-three 
thousand dollars.” ! 
The building is one of the handsomest in the United States, and very 
fine additions were made to the library by Hon. W. C. Preston and Dr. 
J. H. Thornwell, which they collected in England. 
    REORGANIZATION OF 1852. 
Since its reorganization in 1882 the college has comprised, besides 
the school of law, seven full courses, all leading to the degree of A. B., 
and five shorter courses. In this way the demand for a broader and 
more elective system has been met. There are also post-graduate 
courses leading to the degree of A.M, and four professional degrees eye

are also conferred. Unfortunately the requirements for entrance have 
been lowered far below those required under the old system. In Latin 
the authorities require only four books of Cesar and six of the Aineid, 
besides the grammar and elements of prose composition; in Greek, 
only four books of the Anabasis; in mathematics, no farther than al- 
gebra to equations of the second degree. 
When the college was reorganized in 1882, for the first time in its 
history the recommendation of that bold radical, Thomas Cooper, 
made half a century before, was put into practice, and the State had a 
free college, as well as free schools. 
OPPOSITION OF THE DENOMINATIONAL SCHOOLS. 
The sectarian schools believed that they were injured by this feature 
of the State College, and a demand was made for tuition to be charged. 
The argument was advanced that it was unfair that sects should be 
taxed for both their own schools and the State College, and further, that 
this power of taxation should not be used by the State to damage the _ 
denominational colleges. 4 
The cry was taken up in the State, and made an issue in local polities 
in some counties. Those counties under the shadow of a denomina- 
tional school elected candidates opposed to the State University. The 
matter was finally brought toa vote in the Legislature, on a motion 
to strike out the appropriation for the University, and the opponents 
of the University were badly routed. They now fell back on the free- 
tuition feature. The clause of the law relating to the matter seemed 
to leave it with the trustees whether they would charge tuition or not. 
The sectarians contended that the law was mandatory, and required 
tuition to be charged. To quiet agitation and put the matter to rest, 
the Legislature fixed the tuition at forty dollars. And so after a trial 
of only three years, in which it had worked so well, the State again 
violated Thomas Cooper’s principle of a free University. 
Within the last two years another attack against the college was 
threatened in another quarter, from the farmers, in their crusade for a 
separate agricultural college; but this seems to have been a blessing 
in disguise, since the result has been to place the institution in its 
present advantageous position. . 
PRESENT CONDITION. 
The friends of the college were kept on the alert by these attacks, and 
were brought to consider earnestly the needs of the school and the 
best way to improve it. After reviewing the whole subject of univer- 
sity discipline, they adopted the following scheme of a State Univer- 
sity. They determined to erect a school of agriculture and mechanic 
arts, a school of pharmacy, a college of law, a normal school, a college of 
liberal arts and sciences, and such other schools as might be necessary. 
 
-P-A-G-E-222
HSS: 5 HIGHER EDUCATION IN SOUTH CAROLINA. 
These were all to be located at Columbia under the name of the Uni- 
versity of South Carolina, and the name of the South Carolina College 
would disappear. They went before the Legislature with this plan, and 
asked for an additional appropriation to carry it into effect. 
The friends of the separate agricultural college opposed it with all 
their skill, but it passed bya large majority. The trustees have also 
secured the money for an experimental farm, under the Hatch Bill. 
COST TO THE STATE—AMOUNT APPROPRIATED. 
As the institution was established, supported, and patronized by the 
State, it becomes a matter of rational curiosity to know what it has 
cost the State. The total amount appropriated from the beginning, in- 
cluding the large sum in December, 1887, has been $1,446,481. There 
has never been any endowment whatever, except a few scholarships, 
now six in number, which hardly more than pay the tuition, The in- 
come from student fees has never been very large, and is now less than 
eight thousand dollars. The college has been open for more than three- 
quarters of a century, and in that time it has cost the people less than 
is now paid for the public schools in three years. Two-thirds of the 
total amount will not equal the gross receipts of the State government 
for one year, Considering the number of great men the institution has 
trained, the large proportion of public men in the State it has gradu- 
ated, and the impulse it has given to education and improvement, the 
State has never received larger returns from any investment. In 1887 
the trustees felt that some effort should be made to extend the work of 
the institution, and they asked for an increase of appropriation. This 
was granted, and the amount increased to thirty-seven thousand five 
hundred dollars. This, with the student fees, land scrip fund, and 
Hatch Bill, will give the college an annual income of sixty-five thou- 
sand dollars. 
The proposed changes are best described in the following communi- 
cation from the president, giving in detail the 
OUTLINE OF REORGANIZATION OF THE UNIVERSITY. 
By aehandsome majority vote of both Houses the General Assembly 
has granted the necessary authority and appropriations for the reorgan- 
ization of the University of South Carolina on the following general 
plan or basis (the plan was to have been elaborated and perfected by 
the board of trustees at its regular meeting on February 8, 1888): 
(1) The University of South Carolina to be re-established at Colum- 
bia exclusively for white students, and to be composed of the following 
departments: Post-Graduate Department; College of Agriculture and 
Mechanic Arts; College of Liberal Arts and Sciences; College of 
Pharmacy; Normal School; Law School; Agricultural Experiment Sta- 
tion; and such other departments as the trustees may hereafter estab-

An experimental farm of about one hundred acres, well stocked and 
equipped, will be an adjunct to the College of Agriculture and Mechanic 
Arts. 
A hall, erected at an original cost of thirty-five thousand dollars, will 
be set apart for the mechanical department, and the chemical, biologi- 
eal, and physical laboratories. 
The public schools of the city and the Winthrop Training School for 
Teachers (female) will be closely affiliated with the Normal School of 
the University, and the graded classes of the former, from the primary 
to the highest, and the model classes of the latter will be open to its 
students. An arrangement will be made by which the students in the 
senior courses of the Normal School will be allowed to handle the above- 
named classes in the school-rooms. This will give the school admirable 
equipment for practical training. 
In the several departments and colleges of the University, a wide 
range of instruction and varied courses of study will be offered. The 
actual teaching force will be twenty-seven, besides officers and foremen. 
Laboratories will be provided in every science, a gymnasium erected, 
an infirmary established, and the institution thoroughly equipped for 
its larger and higher work. 
CONCLUSION. 
The present outlook for the school is very flattering, and its friends 
can confidently look forward to larger attendance and greater results 
than ever before. There are now twenty-seven men on the academic 
staff, chosen on the whole with very great care. This number for the 
branches covered is almost as large as that of any Southern institution. 
It is most gratifying’ to know that the trustees are broad and liberal, 
and do not confine their choice of men within State lines, or the creed of 
any sect. In choosing nine new men in May, 1888, seven of them came 
from outside of the State, and one of the remaining two was not born in 
South Carolina. Even the historic sectional line was disregarded in 
selecting one of the appointees from Iowa. No religious tests are re- 
quired, but the experiment with Thomas Cooper could not be repeated. 
Of course in the choice, local pride and feeling have to be regarded. 
But great men have been connected with the institution in times past, 
and there is no reason why great men should not be connected with it 
again. The impetus which the greatness of a Lieber or a Cooper gives 
to a college is many-fold greater than that imparted by any number of 
moderate men.

There was a time when the school at Columbia had no rival, but 
that is so no longer. But the issue has been fought out in other States, 
and it will have to be brought to a conclusion in South Carolina. There 
is one thing to cheer the friends of the State institution,—the vic- 
tory in other States has largely rested with the advocates of State aid. 
All the denominations in the State cry out that it is an institution sup- 
ported by the State for the Episcopalians, since they have no school 
in her borders. They claim that the Episcopalian is one of the smaller 
denominations, and yet it gets nearly all the benefit of the State 
school, since each of the other larger denominations has its own col- 
lege. Four years ago it was attempted to raise a point on the fact 
that a majority of the officers of the State government were members 
of the Episcopal Caurch, and that the people were taxed for the ad- 
vantage of this small body of Christians. The charge that the college 
is maintained for the Episcopalians is just about as baseless as the 
charge that the State exists for them. In 1886, in church membership 
of the students, every church in the State was represented on the roll- 
call, with the Episcopalians in the fourth place. The four leading 
Protestant denominations were represented on the academic staff, with 
the Episcopalians in second place, having but one more than either 
the Baptists or the Methodists. No one thinks seriously that this was 
designed. 
As far as salaries go, there is no need for the institution to lack great 
scholars. The compensation is as large as that of the queen Univer- 
sity of the West, and of most colleges. The institution need not be a 
rival of the denominational schools; its staff is nearly as large as that of 
all the denominational schools in the State. Its course is higher, and 
can be made so high as to give them ample room to live as training 
schools. With as far-seeing and as progressive a president as the one 
now at the head of it, the courses can easily be extended into advanced 
post-graduate ones. This is the tendency of the leading colleges now, 
and those that start the soonest will get the most patronage. 
The people showed their liberality at the last session of the Legisla- 
ture in a large increase of appropriation, and “7 may we not hope for 
still greater generosity in the future? 
In considering the educational question, and in presenting the edu- 
cational condition of the South, the difficulties which have surrounded 
and still surround her citizens should be remembered. 
Beside the difficult duty of adjusting the problem of two distinct races 
living in the same country on perfect political equality, which the mind 
of Thomas Jefferson was unable to grasp and solve, it should be remem- 
bered that at the close of the War the wealth of this section of the 
nation had been dissipated in the protracted struggle, and all the re- 
sources of the country had been brought into requisition and strained 
to their utmost capacity. Atits close the people went to work, and the 
cases ot 1dleness were rare exceptions, All of their wealth had been

lost, and the vast planting interest had nothing to sustain it but value- 
less tracts of land. The character of the people, happily, had been 
hardened by the ordeals through which they had passed, and they met 
their trials with the same courage that had inspired them to maintain 
the unequal struggle for four years. Under the old régime, as in all 
countries, they were divided by class distinctions ; but after four years 
of service side by side, the veterans of the War recognized each other 
as brethren, and struggled together in this new battle against adverse 
fate. Some of the most prominent citizens, for a period of years, hitched 
their horses to the plough, and did as honest daily work as the hardest- 
handed laborers. The number of leading men of rank who applied 
themselves to all sorts of manual work gives an example of the coura- 
geous character of its citizens. Under all these circumstances they have 
applied themselves, not only to the development of their material inter- 
ests, but also to the improvement of their social and educational condi- 
tion. They have borne patiently the imposition of heavy taxes to build 
up their public school system, and to educate with equal advantages 
the children of both races, and they have not complained of the hard- 
ships which have environed them. They have triumphed over social 
and material troubles, and under the protection of the Constitution of 
the United States, as in other States, and with the control of their own 
domestic affairs, their future is safe, and they will, with equal justice to 
all, overcome the difficulties which surround them.

A BIBLIOGRAPHY OF THE HISTORY OF HIGHER EDUCA- 
TION IN SOUTH CAROLINA. 
The libraries of Congress and the Bureau of Education in Washing- 
ton, and of the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, contain most 
of the appended authorities, but several were kindly lent from private 
collections. 
The following bibliography contains all the published sources of ma- 
terial, except those from which only a reference, a suggestion, or a single 
fact was obtained. 
David Ramsay’s History of South Carolina. 
Two volumes, from the earliest times down to 1808. It is the largest history of 
the State ever written. Vol. II (pp. 352-383) probably contains the first 
sketch of education ‘n the State. In spite of his practice as a physician in 
Charleston he wasa busy literary man, and wrote a life of Washington, a uni- 
versal history, and other works. 
William Gilmore Simms’s History of South Carolina, 1860. 
This work is the product of the novelist and poet, the leading literary writer of 
the State, and contains some references to the founding of the State Univer- 
sity, and a short sketch of the free schools.

De Bow’s Magazine: “Industrial Resources of the Southern and 
Western States.” 
Several valuable articles on education in the South are to be found in this publi- 
cation, and some of them relate exclusively to education in South Carolina. 
It was the only periodical of the kind in the South that lived for a long term 
of years, and its success is mainly due to the editorial capacity of a South 
Carolina man, a graduate of Charleston College. 
The magazine was issued in New Orleans from 1846 to 1860, Vols. I to XXIX. In 
1865 De Bow removed to New York and revived the work. He published four 
volumes in 1866 and 1867, and continued the publication until his death. The 
chief articles touching upon edacation in South Carolina are found in Vols. 
XVIII, XX, XXII, and XXVII. One of them is an answer to Doctor Thorn- 
well’s celebrated letter to Governor Manning on public education.

Statutes of South Carolina. 
So high was the appreciation of Thomas Cooper that the Legislature made a place 
for him after his forced resignation from the South Carolina College in 1835, 
and appointed him to collect and arrange the statutes of the State. He was 
engaged at this task until his death, four years after. The work shows the 
impress of his boldness and originality ; for the first volume is not simply a 
painstaking compilation of the acts of Assembly, but he incorporated in it 
many documents to illustrate the growth of liberty; e.g., Magna Charta, Bill 
of Rights, Declaration of Independence, Constitution of the United States, 
and several papers relating to the tariff and nullification discussion in South 
Carolina. He edited five volumes, and the work was theu continued by 
David J. McCord, a prominent lawyer at the Columbia bar. Since then vol 
umes have been issued at intervals of several years, until, numbering con- 
secutively from the first one by Thomas Cooper, thirteen have been published, 
covering the entire period to the present, with the aid of the last volume of 
revised statutes. 
Hand-Book of the State of South Carolina. Published by the State 
Board of Agriculture of South Carolina. Charleston: Walker, Evans 
& Cogswell. 1883. 
This was aimed to set forth the advantages of the State for immigrants, but 
the editor while discharging this duty had loftier purposes, and has gathered 
into one volume a wealth of information, historical, scientific, industrial, 
geographical, and general, including an important sketch’ of education by 
Prof. R. Means Davis. Most of the articles were prepared by the best spe- 
cialists, and the entire work is one of the most valuable publications ever 
issued by the State: It is the only general work of reference for the State, 
and is supplemented by a fine geological map. If the Department of Agri- 
culture had never done more than this it would have amply paid for all it 
has cost the State. }

Maximilian La Borde’s History of the South Gorell College. Two 
editions. 
College work filled the greater part of La Borde’s life, and with him every- 
thing connected with it deserved careful treatment, even the petty student 
rows. Every little difficulty between the students and the college authori- 
ties, under his hand, swelled into large proportions, and must be described 
with all the gravity befitting an important affair of state. The book is the 
completest repository of information respecting the institution, and is the 
most elaborate history of any college south of the Potomac River. His sketch 
of Thomas Cooper, while short, is one of the completest hitherto written. He 
was acquainted with the noted radical, and, if he had taken the trouble to 
learn more of the facts of Cooper's early life, and had described more of the 
interesting incidents that must have occurred during Cooper’s presidency, 
instead of answering Cooper’s attacks on religion, his work would be much 
more valuable for historical students.

years before his graduation, in 1832; and also contains a picturesque deserip- 
tion of Thomas Cooper, as he appeared to the students. Scenes and incidents 
illustrative of country school life in upper South Carolina, during the early

The Life and Letters of James Henley Thornwell, D. D., LL. D. By 
B. M. Palmer, D. D., LL. D. Richmond, 1875. 
Doctor Palmer has done a good service in preparing this work. Fortunately the 
papers of Doctor Thornwell had been preserved. His biographer laboriously 
gathered other material by extensive correspondence, before it was lost 
through the death of Doctor Thornwell’s friends. Doctor Thornwell was 
considered one of the most vigorous and original thinkers ever at the college, 
and in after years, as professor and president of the institution, he left his im- 
press upon the educational life of the State. Besides his educational labors, 
his contributions to theology mark him as one of the greatest theologians ever 
produced in the South.

tion in South Carolina. Originally published in November, 1853. Re- 
published in the edition of the News and Courier, July, 1885, by the 
City Council of Charleston, for the information of the people. 
This is the longest and most important contribution to education ever written by 
an educator in the State on the institutions of the State. It was originally 
ealled forth in defence of State education, and was republished over a quar- 
ter of a century later, in 1885, as the best answer to those who were seeking 
to cripple the usefulness of the State institutions. Thus Thornwell dead con- 
tinned sacredly to defend the institutions whose usefulness and reputation he 
helped so much while living.

APPENDIX IL. | 
COLONIAL EDUCATION IN SOUTH CAROLINA.! 
By Epwarp McCrapy, Jr. 
A Paper read before the Historical Society of South Carolina, August 6, 1883. Reprinted, with some 
slight alterations, by permission of the author. 
[As the purpose of the following paper, read before the Historical Society of South 
Carolina, and now published by that body, is to refute the charge made by Mr. Mc- 
Master, in his History of the People of the United States, of the neglect of education 
in South Carolina prior to and during the Revolution, I have given exact quotations 
from the authors and acts I have cited rather than my understanding of what they 
wrote or contained, thus avoiding any misunderstanding of the texts, on my part. 
TI have also restricted myself to the period of which Mr. McMaster treats in the 
volume of his work now before the public. There is much in the subsequent history 
of education in the State which is interesting, but as this paper is a refutation, and 
a refutation only, I have not stepped beyond the period of which he has so far writ- 
ten,—Epwarp McCrapy, Jr. Charleston, S. C., October 22, 1883.] 
In A View of South Carolina, by John Drayton, published in 1802, we find the au- 
thor good-humoredly ridiculing a learned professor of Princeton for his assertion, in a 
work on the human species, that the poor and laboring classes in South Carolina are 
deformed and misshapen, and “ degenerated to a complexion that is but a few shades 
Jighter than that of the Iroquois.” Mr. Drayton observes: “The doctor has never 
been in this State; how then has he been able to give this unpleasant and degrading 
account of some of her inhabitants? It could only have been by information, not 
from Carolinians, for they are better informed, but by strangers who, to use the 
doctor’s own words, ‘judge of things, of men,and manners under the influence of 
habits and ideas framed in a different climate, and a different state of society.’” Mr. 
Drayton quotes the learned professor as saying: “It is ashame for philosophy, at 
this day, to be swallowing the falsehoods, and accounting for the absurdities of 
sailors.” ‘He would have done well, also,” Mr. Drayton goes on to say, ‘‘in keep- 
ing clear of an error into which philosophers are apt to fall; which is to reason from 
assumed facts. in order to support favorite principles.” 
This was written in the commencement of the century, and now at the near end of 
it, we of the South, and of South Carolina particularly, have still to complain of un- 
just representations. As an instance, we quote from McMaster’s History of the Peo- 
ple of the United States, Vol. I, p. 27: 
“In the Southern States education was almost wholly neglected, but nowhere to 
such an extent asin South Carolina. In that colony, prior to 1730, no such thing as a 
grammar school existed. Between 1731 and 1776 there were five. During the Revolu- 
tion there were none. Indeed, if the number of newspapers printed in any community 
may be taken as a gauge of the education of the people, the condition of the Southern 
States as compared with the Eastern and Middle was most deplorable. In 1775 there were 
in the entire country thirty-seven papers in circulation. Fourteen of them were in   
4 The growth of the American public school system and its excellence have imparted a peculiar 
interest to the history of the Massachusetts colony, in which its essential principles were first form- 
ulated and developed. Massachusetts, however, did not stand alone in efforts for the establishment 
of schools. The same purpose animated her sister colonies. This is particularly true of South Caro- 
lina, as the following paper abundantly proves.—N. H. R. D.

    ao 212 HIGHER EDUCATION IN SOUTH CAROLINA. 
New England, four were in New York, and nine in Pennsylvania; in Virginia and 
North Carolina there were two each; in Georgia one, in South Carolina three. The 
same is true to-day.” 
For the existence of this neglect, and the deplorable condition of education in the 
South, the author cites two authorities: Ramsay’s History of South Carolina and 
Hudson's History of Journalism in the United States. Let us see if his authorities 
sustain his assertions and conclusions. 
Prejudice may warp the judgment so as to lead it to accept as true statements 
which have no foundation in fact, and to form conclusions not warranted if the state- 
ments were true; but not even prejudice can excuse or account for a-misquotation. 
Mr. McMaster asserts that in the Southern States education was almost wholly neg- 
lected, but nowhere to such an extent asin South Carolina; and thatin that colony, 
prior to 1730, no such thing as a grammar school existed; and gives as his authority 
Ramsay’s History of South Carolina. Now, with the book open before us, we deny 
that Ramsay made any such statement; on the contrary, he has a chapter on ‘The 
Literary History of South Carolina” (Chap. IX, Vol. 2), in which he shows that no 
sooner had the settlers provided shelter and the necessaries of life, “than they 
adopted measures for promoting the moral and literary improvement of themselves, 
and particularly of the rising generation.” (See p. 353.) 
The nearest approach to Mr. McMaster’s quotation is this séntence at the close of 
the chapter (Vol. II, p. 388): ‘ There was no grammar school in South Carolina prior 
to 1730, except the free school in Charleston; from 1730 till 1776 there were not more 
than four or five, and all in or near Charleston.” Mr. McMaster, it will be observed, 
has omitted a part of the sentence he undertook to quote. But since Mr. McMaster has re- 
ferred us to Dr. Ramsay, as an authority upon the matter of education of the people 
of Sonth Carolina, let us see what Dr. Ramsay does say on the subject, and let us refer 
a little more particularly to his authorities, and add some others, more fully showing 
the attention paid to education in South Carolina before and during the Revolution. 
I—Scnoors PRIOR TO THE REVOLUTION. 
Dr. Ramsay, as we have seen, commences his chapter on the literary history of South 
Carolina with the statement that the earliest settlers of the Province had no sooner 
provided themselves with shelter than they adopted measures for promoting the moral 
and literary improvement of themselves and of their children. He goes on then to 
give this account of the establishment of free schools in the Province. On page 354, 
Vol. II, we read: 
“Tn the years 1710 and 1712, the Assembly passed laws ‘for founding and erecting 
a free school in Charlestown for the use of the inhabitants of South Carolina.’ The 
preamble of the latter, after setting forth ‘the necessity that a free school be erected 
for the instruction of youth in grammar and other arts and sciences, and also in the prin- 
ciples of the Christian religion ; and that several well-disposed Christians by their 
last wills had given several sums of money for the founding of a free school,’ proceeds 
to enact ‘that Charles Craven, Charles Hart, Thomas Broughton, Nicholas Trott, 
Arthur Middleton, Richard Beresford, William Rhett, Gideon Johnson, Francis Lejau, 
Robert Maul, Ralph Izard, Joseph Morton, George Logan, Alexander Parris, Hugh 
Grange, and William Gibbon, and their successors, be a body corporate, by the name 
of the commissioners for founding, erecting, governing, and visiting a free school 
for the use of the inhabitants of South Carolina, with all the power of a corporation, 
and with particular authority to take possession of all gifts and legacies formerly 
given for the use of the free school, and to take up or purchase as much land as might be 
deemed necessary for the use of the school, and to erect thereon suitable buildings.” 
He goes on to say (pp. 355-356): “Provision was also made for ‘the support of an 
usher and a master to teach writing, arithmetic, merchant’s accompts, surveying, 
navigation, and practical mathematics.’ It was also enacted ‘that any school- 
master settled in a country parish, and approved by the vestry, should receive ten 
 
-P-A-G-E-249
  COLONIAL EDUCATION IN SOUTH CAROLINA, 213 
pounds per annum from the public treasury ;’ and that ‘the vestries should be author- 
ized to draw from the same source twelve pounds toward building a school-house in 
each of the country parishes.’ ” 
Now, this was before Mr. McMaster when he asserted that Dr. Ramsay had stated 
there was ‘‘no grammar school in South Carolina prior to 1730; ” and so much he can 
not escape from the knowledge of, when he was recklessly making so grave a charge 
against a people. But if, led by a real historical spirit, he had examined the acts to 
which Dr. Ramsay refers (and which are to be found in all the large bar libraries in 
New York and elsewhere), he would have seen that the act of 1710, as well as that of 
1712, contained the recital that the gifts of money for the founding of a free school 
had then (in 1710) already been made; from which he would have learned that even 
prior to 1710 the people of South Carolina had conceived and attempted the estab- 
lishment of a free school; and had he examined further, he would have found that 
South Carolina during colonial times was very little, if any, behind even Massachu- 
setts in the matter of public education. 
Dr. Dalcho! writes (1710-11): “The want.of schools was a source of great solicitude 
to the inhabitants, and called for the exertions of the virtuous and the good. The 
missionaries, and many other gentlemen of the Province, addressed the society * on 
this interesting and important subject. They described the deplorable condition of 
the rising generation for want of sufficient education, and lamented the decay of 
piety and morals as the inevitable consequence of leaving the young to their own pur- 
suits, and to the influence of evilexample. The spiritual as well as temporal inter- 
ests of the people were declared to be at stake, as an ignorant, uneducated communi- 
ty was but a small remove from the habits and feelings of savage life. The society 
felt the force of the appeal. In the year 1711 they established a school in Charles- 
town, and placed it under the care of the Rev. William Guy, A. M., whom at the same 
time they appointed an assistant to the rector of St. Philip’s Parish.” 
Professor Rivers, in his Early History of South Carolina, says: ‘‘The Society for 
Propagating the Gospel sent out missionaries not only to preach, but ‘to encourage 
the setting up of schools for the teaching of children.’ Their school-masters were re-. 
quired ‘to take especial care of the manners of the pupils in and out of school; warn- 
ing them against lying and falsehood and evil speaking; to love truth and honesty ; 
to be modest, just, and affable; to receivein their tender years that sense of religion 
which may render it the constant principle of their lives and actions.’ The want of 
schools, however, was not immediately remedied, and so urgent appeals were made to 
the society that in 1711 they established a school in Charlestown under Rey. William 
Guy. In the previous year several persons having bequeathed legacies for founding a 
free school, an act was passed (1712) for this purpose, and soon afterward for extend- 
ing similar benefits to all the parishes.” * 
A tombstone still standing in St. Philip’s church-yard attests that such a school was 
actually established, and maintained at least until 1729. The inscription upon it is 
as follows:

The act alluded to by Professor Rivers was, “An Act additional to an Act entitled, 
‘An Act for establishing county and precinct courts,’” passed February 23, 1722. The 
original was not to be found when the Statutes at Large were compiled, but the text 
is given in Trott’s Laws of South Carolina. By this act the justices of these courts 
were authorized to purchase lands, erect a free school in each county and precinct, 
and to assess the expense upon the lands and slaves within their respective jurisdic- 
tions. They were to appoint masters who should be ‘ well skilled in the Latin 
tongue,” and be allowed twenty-five pounds proclamation money per annum. Ten 
poor children were to be taught gratis yearly, if sent by the justices.' 
Dr. Ramsay proceeds (p. 356) to tell that Sir Francis Nicolson, the first Royal Gov- 
ernor of the Province (1721-24), was a great friend to learning; and that he liberally 
contributed to its support, and pressed on the inhabitants the usefulness and necessity 
of Provincial establishments for its advancement; and that the inhabitants, urged by 
his persuasions, engaged in providing seminaries for the instruction of youths. 
Besides these general contributions, Dr. Ramsay tells of several particular legacies left 
for this purpose. Mr. Whitmarsh left five hundred pounds to St. Paul’s Parish for 
founding a freo school in it. Mr. Ludlam, missionary at Goose Creek, bequeathed all 
his estate, which was computed to amount to two thousand pounds, for the same pur- 
pose.? Richard Beresford, by his will, bequeathed to the vestry of St. Thomas’ Parish 
one-third of the yearly profits of his estate for the support of one or more school-masters, 
who should teach writing, accounts, mathematics, and other liberal learning ; and 
the other two-thirds for the support, maintenance, and education of the poor of that 
parish. The vestry accordingly received from this estate six thousand five hundred 
1 Trott’s Laws of South Carolina, p.298; Dalcho's Church History, p.96. See, also, Governor Als- 
ton’s Report to South Carolina Legislature on the Free Schools, 1817. 
2Dr. Dalcho'tells us that the vestry of St. James, Goose Creek, to whom this bequest of Mr. Lud- 
Jam was made, having considered the bequest insufticient for the endowment of a school, had placed 
the money at interest until additional arrangements could be mado to promote the object of the tes- 
tator, and that they proposed to raise an adequate fund by private subscription, but that nothing was 
, done until Juno 18, 1744, when tho fullowing subscription was raised: 
Whereas, Nothing is more likely to promote the practice of Christianity and virtue than the early 
and pious education of youth, we, whose names are underwritten, do hereby agree and oblige our- 
selves, our executors, and administrators, to pay yearly, for three years successively, viz, on or be- 
foro Juno 18, 1745, 1746, and 1747, to the Rey. Mr. Millechamp, or to the church wardens for the timo 
being, tho several and respective sums of money over against our names respectively subscribed, for tho 
setting up ofa school intho parish of St. James, Goose Creck, on the land for that purpose purchased, 
for instructing children in the knowledge and practice of the Christian religion ani for teaching them 
such other things as are suitable to their capacity.

pounds for promoting these pions and charitable purposes. ‘‘This fund,” Dr. Ramsay 
said when he wrote (1808), ‘is still in existence, and has long been known by the 
name of ‘Beresford’s bounty’”—and we may add, was carefully preserved until 
destroyed, or nearly so, during the late War. In 1733, we go on to read, a free school 
was erected at Childsbury, in St. John’s Parish,! on the foundation of six hundred 
pounds bequeathed for that purpose by James Child, and twenty-two hundred pounds 
subscribed by the parishioners. The interest of two hundred pounds, bequeathed by 
Francis Williams, was also appropriated as a fund for teaching poor scholars. In 
1734 a free school was erected in Dorchester.?_ The corporations of these schools were 
cherished by the colonial government, Dr. Ramsay says, and were favored in taking 
up lands. They formed a centre to which were drawn the donations and bequests 
of the charitable. ‘From the triple source of tuition money, public bounty, and 
private donations, a fund was created which diffused the means of education far 
beyond what could have been accomplished by uncombined exertions conducted with- 
out union or system.” This is Dr. Ramsay’s comment; and yet he is eited by Mr. 
McMaster as authority for his assertion that education was almost wholly neglected 
in the South, and nowhere to such an extent as in South Carolina. 
From Dalcho we learn that the desire for the education of the rising generation 
was now (1721-28) generally felt through the Province. Many pious persons, he 
says, had bequeathed portions of their estates for this benevolent purpose, and many 
contributed largely by their subscriptions. In the parish of St. Paul’s a considerable 
sum was raised by subscription for founding a free school for the education of the poor, 
and to which John Whitmarsh added a legacy of five hundred pounds.? He also 
mentions two other legacies for the use of schooling and educating the poor children 
in the parish of St. John’s Colleton, John’s Island, in 1770—one by Col. John Gibbs 
of five hundred pounds, and one by George Hext of twelve hundred and fifty pounds. 
Turning to the General Statutes of South Carolina, we find that an act was passed. 
March 24, 1724, ‘for the founding and erecting, governing, ordering, and visiting a 
free Benes! at the town of Der neseart in the parish of St. George, in Berkeley County, 
for the uso of the inhabitants of the province of South Caroiina.” Nothing, however, 
seems to have been accomplished under this act, possibly from some impracticable ~ 
provisions contained in it; but this is only surmise, as the text of it is not now to be 
found—the title only has been preserved.* But in 1734 another act, with the same 
title, was passed, the preamble of which is so pertinent that we will quote it: 
“ Whereas, By the blessing of Almighty God, the youth of this Province are become 
very numerous, and their parents so well inclined to have them instructed in grammar 
and other liberal arts and sciences, and other useful learning, and also in the principles 
of the Christian religion, that the free school erected, authorized, and established in 
Charlestown for this purpose is not sufficient fully to answer the good intent of such 
an undertaking; And, whereas, Several of the inhabitants of this Province who have 
a numerous issue and live at such a distance from the said free school now established 
in Charlestown, that their circumstances may not be sufficient to permit them to send 
their children thither to be educated, whereby they may be deprived of so great a 
benefit; and it therefore appearing necessary that one or more schools be founded 
and erected in other part or parts of this Province as shall be most convenient for 
carrying out so laudable a design, we therefore pray. your Most Sacred Majesty that 
it may be enacted,” etc.5 
  
Thomas Broughton, Thomas Hasel, Anthony Bonneau, John Harleston, Nathaniel Broughton, 
Thomas Cordes, and Francis Lejau were appointed trustees, with the necessary powers for promot- 
ing the interests of the institution.—Ramsay’s History of South Carolina, Vol. II, p. 198. 
? Alexander Skeene, Thomas Waring, Joseph Blake, Arthur Middleton, Ralph Izard, Robert 
Wright, Paul Jenys, Walter Izard, Benjamin Waring, Francis Vernod, William Cattel, dnd John Williams were appointed trustees for taking caro of its interests.—Ibid., p. 199. 8 Dalcho’s Church History, p. 353.

216 HIGHER EDUCATION IN SOUTH CAROLINA. 
The year before (1733) the free school at Childsbury, in St. John’s Parish, men 
tioned above, had been established. Let us give the preamble to this act: 
“ Whereas, Nothing conduces more to the private advantage of every man, or the 
public benefit of the country in general, than a liberal education, and the same can- 
not be had without due encouragement to persons qualified to instruct youth; and 
Mr. James Child, late of this Province, deceased, desiring, as far as lay in his power, 
to promote the same, did, in and by hislast will and testament, give and bequeath 
the sum of five hundred pounds current money of Carolina toward the encourage- 
ment of a grammar school, and other learning, at Childsbury, in St. John Parish, 
Berkeley County; and also did further give, devise, and bequeath the sum of one 
hundred pounds like money, and alot to build a convenient house for the said school ; 
and left the same to certain trustees in the said will named to manage the same ac- 
cording to the directions of his will; and the said sums being far too short for the 
said purposes, several gentlemen, well weighing the great want of necessary learning 
in the Province, and being desirous to encourage so good an undertaking (according 
to their several abilities), have, by voluntary subscriptions, raised the sum of two 
thousand two hundred pounds like current money to be added to the legacy of the 
said James Child, and have also chosen trustees to be joined with those named in the 
said Mr. James Child’s wil! to manage the said sums for the use of the said school, 
and as visitors to order, direct, and govern the said school. We therefore humbly 
pray your Most Sacred Majesty that it may be enacted,” etce.! 
Now, in reading these preambles to acts which were passed establishing these 
schools, can it be said that the people of South Carolina were at that early day un- 
mindful of education? The population of the Province in 1734 was but 7,333.2 
Bat let us again return to Dr. Ramsay’s History, to which Mr. McMaster refers us, 
and to the same chapter from which he so incorrectly quotes. We read at page 362: 
“Education has also been fostered in South Carolina by several societies as a part 
of a general plan of charity. The oldest of this class is the: South Carolina Society, 
which was formed about the year 1737. 
“It pays the salary of a school-master and school-mistress for the education of 
children of both sexes. Since the commencement of their school ” (i. ¢., 1737 to 1808) 
“several hundreds of pupils have received the benefit of a plain education from its 
bounty. There is a succession of scholars. None are received under eight years of 
age and none are retained beyond fourteen, and the girls not beyond twelve. The 
present number is seventy-two, and that is steadily kept up; for as fast as any of the 
pupils are dismissed their place is supplied by the admission of others. The present 
funds of this society amount to one hundred and thirty-seven thousand dullars. * * * 
“The Fellowship Society, incorporated in 1769, was originally intended to cover 
under its sheltering wing the deplorable maniac, and for that purpose appropriated 
one-half of its funds. With the other moiety it has followed the humane example of 
the last-mentioned society, and bestows a gratuitous education on the children of 
misfortune. Twenty-five children are now (1808) under a course of plain education 
on its bounty. 
“The St. Andrew’s Society have in like manner lately appropriated a portion of 
their funds for similar purposes, and twenty children are now educated at their ex- 
pense. 
“The Winyaw Indigo Society was incorporated in 1756. The original design of the 
founders of this institution was of a patriotic and charitable nature. 
“It had in view the improvement of the culture and manufacture of indigo, and 
the endowment of a free school. The object of the society is now wholly confined to 
the education of orphan children. Since its commencement there have been educated

and supported upon its bounty between one and two hundred orphans. From the 
continual accession of new members the funds are in a flourishing condition, and ena- 
ble the society to educate twenty children annually.” 
This school for more than a hundred years was the chief school for all the eastern 
part of the country, between Charleston and the North Carolina line, and was resorted 
to by all classes. 
As to the South Carolina Society, see also Shecut’s Essays. 
There was also a grammar school at Beaufort, kept by Mr. Comming, a Scotchman, 
and a private school near Beaufort, kept by the Rev. James Gourlay. 
It will thus be observed that the education of the lower part of the State was car- 
ried on by legislative aid and authority in connection with the Church of England. 
In the upper part of the State, which was settled by the Scotch-Irish Presbyterians, 
churches and school-houses were built together by the ministers of that church, which 
has always been foremost in education in this country. These covenanters, as most 
of them were, coming down from Pennsylvania after Braddock’s defeat, settled in 
the western parts of North and South Carolina, and to a great extent peopled the 
districts of Lancaster, York, Chester, and Union. The principal settlement was at 
the Waxhaws, on the line between the two States. Of the women of these people it 
has been written: “An education—knowledge of things human and divine—they 
prized beyond all price in their leaders and teachers; and craved its possession for 
their husbands and brothers and sons, The Spartan mothers gloried in the bravery 
of their husbands and fathers, and demanded it in their sons—‘ Bring me this, or be 
brought back upon it,’ said one as she gave her son a shield to go out to battle. These 
Presbyterian mothers gloried in the enterprise and religion and knowledge and purity 
of their husbands and children, and would forego comforts and endure toil that their 
sons might be well instructed, enterprisingmen. * * * Withmany, and they the 
influential men and women, the desire of knowledge was cherished before a compe- 
tence was obtained, or the labors of a first settlement overcome. Almost invariably, 
ag soon as a neighborhood was settled, preparations were made for preaching the 
Gospel by a regular stated pastor; and wherever a pastor was located, in that con- 
gregation there was a classical school.” ! 
Dr. Howe, in his History of the Presbyterians, justly observes: ‘‘ Under the Co- 
lonial government the refinements of the higher civilization were kept upon our sea- 
board country by its constant intercourse with the British Isle, whither the sons and 
daughters of the wealthy were often sent for their education, But in the upper 
country the church and the school, both accommodated at first in the rudest and 
most primitive structures, were almost inseparably connected, until, as we have seen 
in the last fifteen years of the eighteenth century, institutions for the higher learning 
had almost everywhere arisen, if not in a form and with endowments which rendered 
them perfect, yet conducted with a becoming energy of purpose, and affording the 
means of a valuable education to those who were to become the future leaders in the 
.church and the State.” ? 
In 1767, a school was opened in the fork between the Broad and Saluda Rivers, 
and in 1768 an act was passed by the General Assembly for incorporating the Salem 
Society, the preamble of which is: “ Whereas, Sundry inhabitants of the district of 
Ninety-Six have formed themselves into a society for the express purpose of endowing 
and supporting a school and seminary of learning, and have fixed upon a spot between 
the Catawba and Savannah Rivers, near Little River Meeting House, as being the 
best situated to answer the designs of the society, and have made application to the 
General Assembly of this State to be incorporated,” etc.* 
There were schools too at Bullock’s Creek, York District, and at Waxhaws, Lancaster

District. There is a tradition that Wade Hampton, afterward General, the ancestor 
of the present General Wade Hampton, taught school on Tyger River, Spartanburg 
District, in 1776.1. But the higher education of this part of the State was principally 
obtained at the ‘‘Queen’s Museum,” afterward called ‘Liberty Hall,” an academy 
in Charlotte, N. C., just beyond the dividing line between the States. It was at this 
academy that General William R. Davie, then a youth of the Waxhaws, afterward 
member of the convention that framed the Constitution of the United States, Gov- 
ernor of North Carolina, and Minister to France, one who was alike distinguished as 
scholar, soldier, statesman, and lawyer, received the education which enabled him to 
take the first honors at Princeton, and fitted him to be the founder of the University 
of North Carolina.? : 
It will thus be scen that during the time that Mr. McMaster asserts that education 
was wholly neglected in South Carolina, there were not only five free schools in the 
colony, but many other schools maintained by charitable societies and churches. 
Indeed, every society formed for charitable or patriotic purposes seems at once to have 
assumed that education must be a part of its business ; and education was deemeda 
part of the religious duties of the clergy, whether Presbyterian, Covenanter, or 
Churchman. 
But these free schools, and schools founded or maintained by charity, and built up 
along with the churches in the wilderness, were by no means the only schools in South 
Carolina prior to the Revolution. It was as true of the South before the Revolution 
as after (as Mr. Orr, the able School Commissioner of Georgia, pointed out to the 
National Educational Association at a recent meeting), that the education of the 
South was carried on principally by means of private schools and academies. 
Dr. Ramsay says: ‘‘ With the growing wealth of the Province, the schools be- 
came more numerous, and co-extended with the spreading population. The num- 
ber of individuals who could afford to maintain private tutors, and of natives who 
were scent abroad for education, increased in like manner. None of the British Prov- 
inces in proportion to their numbers sent so many of their sons to Europe for educa- 
tion as South Carolina,” etc. 
Mr. Drayton, in his Memoirs, writes: ‘‘ Beforo the American War, the citizen of 
Carolina was too much prejudiced in favor of British manners, customs, and knowl- 
edge to imagine that elsewhere than in England anything of advantage could be ob- 
tained. For reasons also of state, perhaps, this prejudice was encouraged by the 
mother country, and hence the children of opulent persons were sent there for edu- 
cation, while attempts for supporting suitable seminaries of learning in this State 
were not sufficiently encouraged and promoted.”* 
Mr. McMaster observes that so late as 1795 a gentleman who had been abroad was 
pointed out in the strects even of large cities with the remark: ‘‘ There goes a man 
who has been to Enrope;” ‘‘ There goes a man who has been to London.” This remark 
points a difference between the Northern and Southern colonies which should not 
be overlooked in considering the character of their respective societies and the edu- 
cation of their people. While it is true that there was little or no intercourse between" 
New England and Old England, there was a close and constant intercourse between 
the people of South Carolina and the mother country ; and the ambition of the South- 
ern planter was to send his son to England for education at Oxford or Cambridge. 
South Carolina seemed to be preparing her sons both at home and abroad for the 
service of the country atlarge. Thus it happened that during the period in which 
Mr. McMaster charges that education was wholly neglected in South Carolina, Arthur 
Middleton, Thomas Heyward, Thomas Lynch, Jr. (three of the signers of the Declara-

tion of Independence), John Rutledge, Hugh Rutledge, Charles Cotesworth Pinck- 
ney, Thomas Pinckney, William Henry Drayton, Christopher Gadsden, Henry Lau- 
“ rens, John Laurens, Gabriel Manigault, William Wragg, and John TForcheraud 
Grimké, among other Carolina youths, had been sent to England for the completion 
of their education. Dr. Ramsay calls attention, too, to the fact that the natives of 
Carolina, though educated in Great Britain, were not biased in favor of that country. 
Most of them joined heartily in the Revolution, and from their superior knowledge 
were eminently useful as civil and military officers in directing the efforts of their 
countrymen in defence of their rights. This, Dr. Ramsay observes in a note, is the 
more remarkable, as the reverse took place in other provinces.! 
Hugh S. Legaré, in a note to his Essay on Classical Learning, says: ‘‘ Before and 
just after the Revolution, many, perhaps it would be more accurate to say most, of 
our youth of opulent families were educated at English schools and universities. 
There can be no doubt their attainments in polite literature were very far superior to 
those of their cotemporaries at the North, and the standard of scholarship in Charles- 
ton was consequently much higher than in any other city on the continent,” ete.? 
“Tn his Retrospect of the Eighteenth Century, published in 1808 by Dr. Samuel 
Miller, late of Princeton, the belief is expressed that the learned languages, especially 
the Greek, were less studied in the Eastern than in the Southern and Middle States, 
and that while more individuals attended to classical learning there than here, it 
was attended to more superficially. The reason is that, owing to the superior wealth 
of the individuals in the latter States, more of their sons were educated in Europe, 
and brought home with them a more accurate knowledge of the classics, and set tho 
example of a more thorough study.” 
But while most of the young men of means of South Carolina were educated abroad, 
those who remained at home did like credit to their education. Charles Pinckney, 
whose draft of the Constitution has been the subject of so much controversy—a con- 
troversy dogmatically decided in a line by Mr. McMaster—and who was not only a 
great statesman, but a learned lawyer and an accomplished classical scholar, received 
his entire education in Charleston. So, too, did Edward Rutledge, until ready to 
commence the study of his profession, when, as customary, he too went to England 
and entered astudent inthe Temple. The letter of his brother John, addressed to him 
upon the pursuit of his studies in England,‘ might be read to-day with profit by any 
student of the law. Dr. William Charles Wells, who promulgated tho first compre- 
hensive theory of dew, and who was the author of a remarkable essay on the theory 
of vision, and a well known medical writer of his time in Edinburgh, obtained his ed- 
ucation in Charleston, which he did not leave until prepared to commence his study 
of medicine in Edinburgh. 
We are told that the Puritan settlers, fully convinced of the necessity of universal 
education, as soon as they had provided themselves temporary shelter reared the 
church and the school-house. So, too, did both Churchmen and Covenanters in South 
Carolina. But the Puritans were not the first to establish free grammar schools, nor 
were the schools established by them the common or public schools of to-day. The 
first free grammar schools, as they were called, that is, schools in which Latin was 
taught, and which were supported in part, at least, by proceeds’ of land, etc., were 
established in Charlestown, Va., in 1621; in Boston, 1636; in Salem, 1641; and in 
most towns of New England within a few years after their settlement; but these, 
though comprising the greater part of the children of the settlement, were not com- 
mon schools in the present sense of that term.® These free pane or common schools,

it is claimed, were inaugurated by the General Court of Massachusetts in 1642-43. 
The law of the latter year provided as follows: 
“Tt is therefore ordered that every township in the jurisdiction, after the Lord hath 
increased them to the number of fifty households, shall then forthwith appoint one 
within the town to teach all such children as shall resort to him to read and write, 
whose wages shall be paid either by the parents or masters of such children, or by the 
inhabitants in a general way of supply as the major part of those that order the prov- 
identials of the town shall appoint: Provided, Those that send their children be not 
oppressed by payment more than they can have them taught for in other towns.” 
Massachusetts was settled in 1620, so that their first effort to establish by law a pub- 
lie school (if such it can be called) was made twenty-three years after the commence- 
ment of the colony. It will be observed that no public or free school was actually 
established by this act of the General Court, as the Legislature of Massachusetts was 
termed. The act was ‘merely directory.” It directed the towns to establish schools, 
but that was all. It did not of itself incorporate or establish schools any more than 
our act of 1712, which authorized tho vestries, or our act of 1722, which directed the 
justices to establish free schools, did so, We do not mean to belittle the source from 
which so great an institution as the American common school system has sprung, if 
this be its true spring. Small is the commencement of most great things. Still we 
must not be misled into the idea that the common school system, as we know it, or 
anything like it, existed two hundred and forty years ago, even in Massachusetts. 
Mr. McMaster has himself prevented us from falling into such an error, for this is the 
account he gives of the New England school-master in 1784, a hundred and forty years 
after. In one of his best passages describing the school-master, as we now know him 
and appreciate him, he says (page 21): 
“But the lot of the school-master who taught in the district school-house three 
generations since fell in a very different time and among a very different people. 
School was then held in the little red school-houses for two months in the winter by 
aman, and for two months in the summer by a woman. The boys went in the win- 
ter, the girls in the summer. The master was generally a divinity student who had 
graduated atone of the academies, who had scarcely passed out of his teens, and who 
sought by the scanty profits derived from a winter’s teaching to defray the expenses of 
his study at Harvard orat Yale. His pay wassmall, yet he was never called upon to lay 
out any portion of it forhiskeep. If the district were populous and wealthy a little 
sum was annually set apart for his board, and he was placed with a farmer who would, 
for that amount, board and lodge him the longest time. But this was a far too expen- 
sive method for many of the districts, and the master was therefore expected to live 
with the parents of his pupils, regulating the length of his stay by the number of the 
boys in the family attending his school. Thus it happened that in the course of his 
teaching he became an inmate of all the houses of the district, and was not seldom 
forced to walk five miles, in the worst of weather over the worst of roads, to his schoo}. 
Yet, mendicant though he was, it would be a great mistake to suppose that he was not 
always a welcome guest. He slept in the best room, sat in the warmest nook by the 
fire, and had the best food set before him at the table. Inthe long winter evenings he 
helped the boys with their lessons, held yarn for the daughters, or escorted them to 
spinning matches and quiltings. In return for his miserable pittance and his board 
the young student taught what would now be considered as the rudiments of an edu- 
cation. His daily labors were confined to teaching his scholars to read with a mod- 
erate degree of fluency, to write legibly, to spell with some regard for the rules of or- 
thography, and to know as much of arithmetic as would enable them to calculate the 
interest on a debt, to keep the family accounts, and to make change in a shop.” 
Now, what did South Carolina require of her school-masters, and what provision 
did she make for their compensation? Let us turn to the statutes and let them speak 
for themselves.! 
  
‘Statutes at Large, Vol. II, p. 389.  
-P-A-G-E-257
  COLONIAL EDUCATION IN SOUTH CAROLINA. 221 
The act of 1712 provided (Section XII) ‘that the person to be master of the said 
school shall be of the religion of the Church of England, and conform to the same, and 
shall be capable to teach the learned languages, that is to say, Latin and Greek tongues; 
(Section XV) that the said school-master shall have, hold, occupy, possess, and enjoy 
all such lands as shall, pursuant to this act, be taken up, purchased, had or received 
for the use of a school-master of the said school, and the school-house and dwelling- 
house and outbuildings upon the same; and also for the further encouragement unto 
him shall have and receive out of the public treasury of this Province the full sum of 
one hundred pounds per annum, to be paid to him half yearly; (Section XVI) thatin 
consideration of the school-master being allowed the use of the lands, dwelling-house, 
and other buildings, and also the yearly salary of one hundred pounds per annum, he 
shall teach freely and without any manner of fee or reward whatsoever over and above 
the number of free scholars to be appointed by each person contributing twenty 
pounds, any number of scholars not exceeding twelve, the scholars to be taught free 
to be nominated by the Commissioners; (Section XVII) that for every scholar the said 
master shall teach, besides those who by this Act are appointed to be taught free, he 
shall be allowed four pounds per annum current money of this Province, to be paid 
him by the parent or guardian of such scholar; (Section XVIII) that in case the school- 
master shall haye more scholars in his school than one man can well manage, the 
Commissioner shall appoint a fit person to be usher, who, for his encouragement, 
shall be allowed fifty pounds per annum out of the public treasury ; and over and above 
that shall be allowed for every scholar that is under his charge (excepting those ap- 
pointed to be taught free) at the rate of thirty shillings; (Section XIX) that a fit per- 
son shall be nominated and appointed by the said Commissioner to teach writing, 
arithmetick, and merchants’ accompts; and also the art of navigation, and other useful 
and practical parts of the mathematicks; and for his encouragement shall be allowed 
not exceeding fifty pounds, to be paid him half yearly out of the public treasury of 
this Province; and in consideration of the said yearly salary to be paid him he shall 
be obliged to teach free all such persons as by this Act are appointed to have their 
learning free; and for other scholars that are not to be taught free he shall be allowed 
for teaching them writing at the rate of thirty shillings per annum; if writing and 
arithmetick, forty shillings; if merchants’ accompts, fifty shillings per annum; and if 
the mathematicks, at such rate ashe shall agree with the several parents and guardians 
of the said children, not exceeding six pounds per annum.” 
By another provision of the act, any person giving twenty pounds toward the 
erecting and founding of the school might nominate one scholar to be taught free for 
five years. 
Section XXI of the act recited and provided as follows: ‘‘And as a further and 
moro general encouragement for the instructing of the youth of this Province in useful 
and neéessary learning, be it enactcd by the authority aforesaid, that as soon as a 
school-master is settled in any other or all the rest of the Parishes of this Province, 
and approved by the Vestry of such Parish or Parishes, such school-master so ap- 
proved from time to time shall receive the sum of ten pounds per annum out of the 
public treasury by quarterly payments; and the Public Receiver is hereby required 
to pay the same.” . 
These were the requirements of the school-master, and the provisions for his main- 
tenance, as established by law in 1712 in the lower part of South Carolina, which 
was only then settled. The teachers of the upper part of the State, which was aot 
settled until forty years after, were generally Presbyterian clergymen from Ireland— 
some were from Scotland. They were usually men of education; some were excel- 
lent arithmeticians, and read and wrote Latin fluently; all were excellent penmen. 
The “ master,” as the teacher was called, besides teaching, discharged many duties 
now performed by lawyers and surveyors. He drew all the wills and titles to land, 
_ and made all the difficult calculations. No man in the settlement was more honorable 
 
-P-A-G-E-258
222 HIGHER EDUCATION IN SOUTH CAROLINA. 
or more honored than the: “master.” The title ‘‘ master” signified more than ‘‘rev- 
erend” or:‘‘doctor” does now.! . 
The character and attainments of the school-masters, as required by the law of 
South Carolina for her free schools, and the provisions made for their support in 1712, 
and of the teachers in the upper part of the State when settled forty years after- 
ward, certainly compare very favorably with the description of the New England 
school-master, and the arrangements for his support, as described by Mr. McMaster 
as existing in 1784.” 
By the act of the General Court of Massachusetts. of 1642-43—the basis of the New 
England common school system, as it is claimed—it was directed that every township 
containing the number of fifty households should appoint one within the town to 
teach the children. What the average number of ‘a household” was then supposed 
to be we have no means of estimating; but as the average New England township of 
the present day, outside of towns having ten thousand inhabitants, is estimated to 
contain seventeen hundred (census of 1870), we may roughly put the New England 
townships during the period under consideration at five hundred, The population of 
South Carolina in 1734 was ] ut seven thousand three hundred and thirty-three, and 
in 1737 there were six free and charitable schools, to wit: Charlestown Free School, 
South Carolina Society School, Childsbury Free School, St. George’s Dorchester Free 
School, Beresford Bownty School, Whitmarsh Free School; that is, one free or chari- 
table school to about every twelve hundred inhabitants. Supposing that a public 
school was actually established in each township in Massachusetts, of which there is, 
however, no more probability than that there was one in each courty precinct in South 
Carolina under our act of 1722, the number in proportion to the inhabitants must still be 
in favor of Massachusetts. But it must be remembered that the difference between’ 
Massavhusetts and South Carolina on the subject of education was and al ways has 
been that Massachusetts claimed to educate her youth generally, rich and poor, by 
the public or common school system, whereas, South Carolina has made no such pre- 
tence, but, on the contrary, has always relied for the education of her sons,more on 
private schools than on public schools. We are not now discussing the relative mer- 
its of the two systems, but are only insisting that in comparing the respective merits 
of the two States as to zeal in education, it must be borne in mind that all the efforts 
of South Carolina as to public education were in addition and supplementary to, and 
not in the place and stead of, the system of private education upon which, wisely or 
not, our people rested. 
Mr. McMaster, it will be recollected, asserts with positiveness that prior to 1730 no 
such thing as a grammar school existed in the colony of South Carolina. Will it be 
believed that the work he refers to as his authority for this statement (Ramsay’s His- 
tory of South Carolina) contains this sentencé: “ The knowledge of grammar and of 
the Latin and Greek languages could be obtained in Carolina at any time after 1712, or the 
Forty-second year subsequent to the settlement of the Province?” We cannot expect that 
it will, unless the reader refers to the second volume (page 353) of that work. 
/ 1 Letter of Rev. Robert Lathan, Yorkville, S. C. 
2 Whatever force there may be in Mr. McMaster’s criticism must consist in the comparative atten- 
tion to or neglect of education in South Carolina as of the time of which he writes. It is not amiss, 
therefore, to recall that in the mother country, the advertisement in the Gentlemen's Magazine for 
1736—‘‘ At Ideal, near Lichfield, in Staffordshire, young gentlemen are boarded and taught the Latin 
and Greek languages by Samuel Johnson”—brought that celebrated person, in his youth, but three 
pupils; upon which Carlyle observes: 
“The career of Literature could not, in Johnson's day any more than now, be said to lie along the 
shores of a Pactolus; whatever elso might be gathered there, gold dust was nowise the chief produce. 
‘The world, from the time of Socrates, St. Paul, and far earlier, had always had its Teachers, andalways 
treated them in a peculiar way. A shrewd Town Clerk (not of Ephesus) once in founding a Burgh— 
Seminary—when the question came how the school-masters should be maintained, delivered this brief 
counsel: ‘D—n them, keep them poor!’” 
South Carolina, certainly, did not adopt this aphorism.  
-P-A-G-E-259
  COLONIAL EDUCATION IN SOUTH CAROLINA. 223 
II.—Scnoois OPEN DURING THE REVOLUTION. 
Let us now examine Mr. McMaster’s assertion, that during the Revolution there was 
no grammar school in existence in South Carolina, 
For this assertion, too, he refers to Dr. Ramsay’s History. There is no such state- 
ment in that work. Nor is it true. ; 
We may well suppose that when Charleston was in the possession of the British, 
that a school-master who was loyal to the cause of his State would not have been al- 
lowed to teach ; but this would scarcely be‘ brought up as a reproach to cur people 
of that time.!’ And when Cornwallis marched through and devastated that other 
part of the State settled by the Scotch-Irish Presbyterians it may well have been 
that school-houses and books were burned, as well as everything else that could not 
be carried off. But such a calamity as war would scarcely be cited as an evidence of 
neglect of education by our people. Beyond this natural supposition there is nothing 
whatever to suggest this assertion, so boldly made by Mr. McMaster. On the con- 
trary, there happens to be evidence that the people of South Carolina did not, even 
in the excitement and distress of invasion, forget the work of education; and that 
her youths were allowed to put down their books only to take up arms in defence of 
liberty. 
In Dr. Howe’s History of the Presbyterian Church in South Carolina, wé read:? 
“Yet in the midst of these scenes of conflict our people were by no means neglecting 
the interests of learning and religion. The Mount Zion Society was established in 
the city of Charleston January 9th, and incorporated February 12th, 1777 [that is, the 
year after the battle of Fort Moultrie], ‘for the purpose of founding, endowing, and 
supporting a public school in the district of Camden for the education and instruction 
of youth... The preamble of the constitution is prefaced by Isaiah LX, 1, and LXI, 3: 
‘Arise, shine, for thy light is come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee. To 
appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of 
joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might 
be called the trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that he might be glori- 
fied.’ The very language is jubilant with hope and courage, and the quotation may 
havo suggested the namo the society adopted. Its members were dispersed over the 
State. It was to have weekly, quarterly, and annual meetings, and these, for the con- 
venience of the most numerous body of members, were held in Charleston, * * * 
The first president was Col. John Winn, and its wardens Gen. William Strother 
and Capt. Robt. Ellison, Col. Thomas Taylor, Capt. Thomas Woodward, and other 
patriots were among the first signers of its constitution. Its membership the first 
year was fifty-eight in number. In 1778 ninety-six were added, in 1779 eighty-seven, 
so that at the close of this decennium two hundred and sixty-five names were found 
ypon its roll. In the second year of its existence we find among the names, Andrew 
Pickens, Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, four sons of Anthony Hampton—Henry, Ed- 
ward, Richard, and Wade—and the brother of Anthony, John Hampton. About this 
time a school was taught in Winnsboro’ by William Humphreys, who it is believed 
was placed there, by the Mount Zion Society. This Mr. Humphreys was a member 
  
1 We have been permitted to make the following extract from a memoir of his family prepared by 
Chancellor De Saussure, who was himself taken from school to serve in the works around Charleston 
during the siege. 
“Henry W. De Saussure [the writer] was born on 16th August, 1763, at Pocotaligo, and was carried 
achild to Beaufort, where the family resided until January, 1779, when they removed permanently to 
Charleston. He was educated partly at a private school near Beaufort kept by the Rev. Mr. James 
Gourlay, and on the removal of his family to Charleston, at a school in Charleston under the care of Mr. 
James Hampden Thompson. Little else, however, than the classics were taught in any of these 
schools. * * * From the time of the invasion of Prevost, in the spring of 1779, the schools were 
closed and the youth of the country called to arms. Among others, the writer, at the age of sixteen 
years, was in arms, and during the siege of Charleston served in a yolunteer corps.”

of the society, and owned lots in Winnsboro’, which he sold avout 1800. At what 
time this school was discontinued is not known, but it was probably about the time 
when Lord Cornwallis moved his headquarters to Winnsboro’ in 1780.” 
Dr. Howe in another place! writes: 
“The Mount Zion Society received new members to the 8th of May, 1780, just four 
days before the surrender of Charleston to the British army. Down to that time about 
fifty new names had been added to the list, among which is that of Charles Pinckney, 
chief justice of the province, and president of the Provincial Congress. There is no 
record after this for about two years. Early in 1783 the society met in Charleston 
and elected John Huger president, appointed John Winn and six others directors in 
Winnsboro’ and its vicinity, and Charles Pinckney and five others directors in Charles- 
ton; and wrote on the 7th of March a letter to the Committee in Winnsboro’ inform- 
ing them of their action, addressing tiem as ‘The Committee on Zion Hill’ This 
committee replied, informing them that the temporary school had been broken up by the 
enemy, but the buildings were safe and in the custody of Col. Richard Winn. 
Dr. Howe goes on to tell that twelve names were added to the roll immediately ; 
lands given by Col. Winn and Col. John Vanderhorst were run out, and the next year, 
1784, seventy-four more names added to the membership of the society and the school 
placed under the charge of the Rev. Thomas Harris McCaule, who proposed to enlarge 
it into a college upon the plan of the college in New Jersey where he had been edu- 
eated; that this plan was adopted, and that Mount Zion, tho College of Cambridge at 
Ninety-Six, and the Charleston College, were incorporated on the 19th March, 1785, 
in the same act. 
On the 5th March, 1778, that is, in the midst of the war, an act was passed for in- 
corporating a society commonly called the Catholic Society, the preamble of which 
tells its purpose: ‘ Whereas, Several inhabitants of this State have associated them- 
selves under the name of the Catholic Society, for the purpose of founding, endowing, 
and supporting a public school in the District of Camden, eastward of the Wateree 
River, for the education and instruction of youth, and have made application to the 
General Assembly of the State to be incorporated,” etc.? 
Bishop Gregg, in his History of the Old Cheraws, says:? “About this time (1777) 
appears the first mention of a society which was destined to exert an important in- 
fluence on the welfare of the communities bordering on the Upper Pedee, 
“But little attention has hitherto been given to the subject of education, Witha 
country recently settled, and most of the inhabitants poor, it was to be expected that 
matters of material interest would first engage the thoughts of the people. For some 
years past, too, the public disturbances, so deeply affecting the peace and prosperity 
of the infant settlements, had seriously retarded their progress. 
“Being now, however, in a state of comparative repose, and with brighter pros- 
pects for the future, the welfare of the rising generation was no longer overlooked. 
“On the 13th December, 1777, this entry appears in the Rev. Mr. Pugh’s journal: 
‘Assembled at the meeting house in society to promote learning ;’ and on the 20th, 
‘went to Dr. Mills, about the society’s rules.’ ‘On the 31st went to the Neck (the 
Welch Neck) to the society, signed the rules, chose officers,’ ete. 
“The Hon. Alexander McIntosh was elected president, and George Hicks and Abel 
Kolb, wardens. 
“The society took the name of ‘St. David’s,’ and by that honored appellation con- 
tinued afterward to be distinguished.” 
Bishop Gregg continues: ‘‘The organization of the society excited much interest 
among the inhabitants of St. David’s Parish. An original subscription paper of the 
date just mentioned (13th December, 1777), with a preamble, has survived the ravages 
of time, and is in these words, viz: 
“As the endowing and establishing public schools and other seminaries of learning

has ever been attended with the most salutary effects, as well by cultivating in 
youth the principles of religion and every social virtue, as by enabling them after- 
ward to fill with dignity and usefulness the most important departments of the State, 
who that is a lover of his country as he looks around him can fail to deplore the greav 
want of this necessary qualification in our youth, especially in the interior parts of 
it, at this early period of our flourishing and rising State? In the future, when we 
shall be at liberty to make our own laws without the control of an arbitrary despot, 
what heart would not glow with pleasure to see a senate filled with learned, wise, and 
able men, for the want of whom the most flourishing republics have become the tools 
of arbitrary despots? And, whereas, there is a society established in the parish of 
St. David, by,the name of the St. David’s Society, purposely for founding a public 
school in said parish, for educating youths in the Latin and Greek languages, math- 
ematics, and other useful branches of learning by those who are not of ability with- 
out assistance to carry so useful and necessary an effort into effect: 
‘« Wherefore, in order to contribute to so laudable and benevolent an undertaking, 
we whose names are licreunto subscribed, do promise to pay, or cause to be paid into 
the hands of the secretary of the said Society the respective sams adjoined to each 
of our names, whenever the same shall be called for by the said secretary or his order.’” 
Many names were signed to this paper, and over two thousand pounds subscribed, 
and on the 28th March following (1778) an act! incorporating the St. David’s School 
was passed.” 
‘It is thus seen that between the victory of Fort Moultrie in 176, and the oceupa- 
tion of Charleston in 1780, and while indeed the British were investing the city of 
Charleston, the people were founding and the Legislature was incorporating new 
public schools. 
Andrew Jackson may not have been a scholar, and we do not cite himas an illus- 
tration of the educational system of South Carolina (though there is good reason to 
suspect that his inelegance of speech was more a matter of affectation than of igno- 
rance,* but his history affords evidence apoE the point we are now considering, and 
    
"1Statutes at Large, Vol. VUL, p. ue. e. 
2Subsequent to this time no further progress appears to have been made with the school, until the 
troubles of the Revolution were over, when it{was reorganized and went into vigorous operation, and 
continued to flourish. The records of its history under the administration of Andrew McCauley, Eli 
King, and Thomas Parke would serve as a model for many of the academies of more recent times. 
Mr. Parke in 1806, upon the organization of the South Carolina College, was transferred to the pro- 
fessorship of languages. There he continued in the uninterrupted discharge of the duty until 1834-35, 
when he was elected treasurer and librarian of the college, and discharged the duties of these offices 
until his death in 1844, in the seventy-ninth year of his age. Among the pupils of St. David’s after- 
ward distinguished were Ezra Pugh, Samuel Wilds, and Charles Motte Lide, names that illumine the 
early judicial history of the State. Hon. Hugh S. Legaré is reported to have said that Mr. Lide was 
the greatest genius he ever knew, and asimilar remark was made by the celebrated Dr. Ramsay. 
3Mr. G. Ticknor Curtis, in a note to Volume I, page 129, of the Life of James Buchanan, in which 
he gives an account of the debate upon the appropriation for the salary of Mr. Randolph as Minister 
to Russia (1831), says: 
“In this debate it was charged that the President’s Message was written by Mr. Van Buren, the 
Secretary of State, and that General Jackson was incapable of writing his official papers. It is very 
probably true that he did not write some of them. His proclamation against the Nullifiers is generally 
assumed to have been written by Edward Livingston. But that General Jackson was capable of 
writing well there can be no doubt. I remember, however, that in my youth, and during his Presi- 
dency, it was generally believed in New England among his political opponents that he was an entirely 
illiterate man, who could not write an English sentence grammatically or spell correctly. This belief 
was too much encouraged by persons who knew better, and it was not until many years afterward that 
Liearned how unfounded itwas. There now lie before me autograph letters of General Jackson written 
wholly with his own hand, and written and punctuated with entire correctness, and with no small 
power of expression. Some of them have been already quoted. These have been and others will be 
printed without the slightest correction. The handwriting is sometimes rather better forexample than 
Mr. Webster's. Thero is not a single erasure in any one of the letters, and but one trifling interlinea- 
tion. The spelling is perfectly correct throughout. General Jackson wrote better English than 
Washington; and as to King George III, the General was an Addison in comparison with his Majesty.”

contradicts Mr, MeMaster’s assertion that there were no schools in the State during 
the Revolution. Mr. Parton tells us that in early life Jackson attended some of the 
better schools of the country—schools, he goes on to explain, kept by clergymen, in 
which the languages were taught. He says the first school of the kind which Jack- 
son attended was an academy in the Waxhaw settlement, of which Dr. Humphries 
was master. In another place he says that by the time the war approached the 
Waxhaw settlement, bringing blood and terror with it, leaving desolation behind it, 
closing all school-houses, and putting a stop to the peaceful labors of the people, An- 
drew Jackson was a little more than thirteen.! Now, as Andrew Jackson was born 
in 1767, he was but eight years of age when the Revolution commenced in 1775, and 
as Cornwallis defeated Gates at Camden on the 16th August, 1730, and in September, 
1780, devastated the Waxhaws, and as Jackson in 1782 spent some time in idleness in 
Charleston, and in the winter of 1784-85 went to Salisbury, N.C., to study law,? it 
follows that the schools he attended were schools which were open in South Carolina 
during the War of the Revolutioa. Indeed, it is known that Dr. Joseph Alexander 
taught in an academy kept open by him at Waxhaws, and there was another at Bul- 
lock’s Creek, York County, during this period,? and there was a school also at Fishing 
Creek, kept open by Mrs. Gaston, wife of Justice John Gaston. * 
Mr. MeMaster asserts that prior to 1730 no such thing as a grammar school existed 
in South Carolina; that between 1731 and 1776 there were but five, and during the 
Revolution there were none. 
The following statement shows the number of schools established before and dur- 
ing the Revolution in each of the election and political divisions of the State, as such 
divisions were arranged by the Constitution in 1776, when the State adopted the Dec- 
laration of Independence. It is known that there were other schools, but of the fol- 
lowing we have record and special mention :

Tt will thus be seen that at the close of the Revolution there were eleven public and three 
charitable grammar schools and eight private schools, of which we know ; that is, twenty-two 
schools in the twenty-four parishes and districts into which the State was then divided. 
We have shown, then, that not only were our schools kept open during the Revolution 
until actually closed by invading armies, but that even amidst scenes of conflict and 
the distress of war our people were alive to the interests of education as well as of 
religion; that nothing but fire and the sword closed our school-houses. But, since 
we are held up in contrast to New England in this matter, let us refer to one of her 
own historians as to her conduct in the matter of education, when the excuse of war 
could be pleaded for its neglect. In Belknap’s History of New Hampshire, Vol. III, 
p. 259 (1792), we read: 
“« Several instances occur in the public records, as far back as the year 1722, just at 
the beginning of an Indian war, that the frontier towns petitioned the Assembly for 
a special act toexempt them from the obligation to maintain a grammar school dur- 
ing the war. The indulgence was granted them, but only on this condition, ‘that 
they should keep a school for reading, writing, and arithmetic ;’ to which all towns 
of fifty inhabitants were obliged. In later times the conduct of the same towns has 
been very different. During the late war with Britain not only those, but many other 
towns, large and opulent, and far removed from any danger of the enemy, were, for a great 
part of the lime, destitute of any public schools; not only without applying to the Legis- 
Jature for permission, but contrary to the express requirements of the law, and not- 
withstanding courts of justice were frequently holden, and grand jurors solemnly 
sworn and charged to present all breaches of law, and the want of schools in par- | 
ticular. ‘The negligence was one among many evidences of a most unhappy prostra- 
tion of morals during that period. It afforded a melancholy, prospect to the friends 
of science and virtue, and excited some generous and philanthropic persons to devise 
other methods of education.” 
III.—NEwspPaPERs. 
‘We come now to Mr. MeMaster’s statement, in regard to the publication of news- 
papers in the South. He says: “Indeed, if the number of newspapers printed in any 
community may be taken as a gauge of the education of the people, the condition of 
the Southern States, as compared with the Eastern and Middle, was most deplorable. 
In 1775 there were in the entire country thirty-seven papers in circulation. Fourteen 
of them were in New England, four were in New York, and nine in Pennsylvania; in 
Virginia and North Carolina there were two each, in Georgia one, in South Carolina 
three. The same is true to-day.” 
One would certainly suppose upon reading this statement that Mr. McMaster had 
examined the statistics of these colonies, and had ascertained, at least as nearly as 
one now can, their respective populations, and that it was upon such a careful ex- 
amination that he had concluded from this data also that in the Southern States edu- 
cation was almost wholly neglected, but nowhere to such an extent as in South Caro- 
lina, But it is evident that he hazarded this statement also without any considera- 
tion; and that it is as unfounded as his statements in regard to our schools, 
To gauge the education of a people by the number of newspapers printed in any 
community, we must first ascertain the number of the community, and compare the 
 
-P-A-G-E-264
  
  228 HIGHER EDUCATION IN SOUTH CAROLINA. 
number of the newspapers with the number of the community ; that is, with its popu- 
lation. Mr. McMaster had just stated (page 8) that it had been estimated that at 
the opening of the war there were in the country, both white and black, two million 
seven hundred and fifty thousand souls; and in a note on the next page he quotes 
from the American Remembrancer, Part II, p. 64, that an estimate of the white popu- 
lation of the States, made in 1783 for purposes of assessment, gives the number as 
two million three hundred and eighty-nine thousand three hundred. 
As then in the whole country at the commencement of the Revolution there were 
but thirty-seven papers, and asthe nearest estimate that can now be had of the 
white population of the.whole country at that time is two million three hundred and 
eighty-nine thousand three hundred, we would have one newspaper published to 
every sixty-four thousand five hundred andseventy-tive. Mr. McMaster allows that: 
at this time South Carolina had three newspapers.! What, then, let us inquire, was: 
the population of South Carolina at that time? We have no estimate of the popula- 
tion of South Carolina in 1775; but in a table given in Drayton’s View of South 
Carolina, p. 103, it is put in 1765 at forty thousand (white). Supposing, then, that the 
white population had increased to the extent of fifty per cent. in the ten years from 
1765 to 1775, we would have the number of whites in South Carolina sixty thousand. 
But we have just seen that the average population in the whole country necessary 
to support one paper was sixty-four thousand ‘five hundred and seventy-five. In 
South Carolina it appears sixty thousand supported three newspapers, or one to every: 
twenty thousand.? . 
Let us now go into this matter a little further, and compare South Carolina with 
the New England States and Pennsylvania, which are held up to us as the standard 
to which we failed to attain. Mr. McMaster gives us from Hudson’s History of 
Journalism the number of newspapers published in New England at fourteen, with- 
out giving the numbers in each of these States. We will give them; they were as 
follows: Massachusetts seven, New Hampshire one, Rhode Island two, Connecticut 
four.® 
Remembering that South Carolina had one newspaper for every twenty thousand 
inhabitants, let us see how many it required to maintain one in New England. 
Massachuset:s.—Mr. Eaton §. Drone, in the American Cyclopedia, estimates the 
population in Massachusetts in 1775 at three hundred.and fifty-two thousand, and as. 
there were then seven newspapers in that State, we have but one newspaper for 
every fifty thousand two hundred and eighty five inhabitants. 
New Hampshire.—“A survey taken in 1775, partly by enumeration and partly by 
estimation, for the purpose of establishing an adequate representation of the people, 
made the whole number eighty-two thonsand two hundred.” (Belknap’s History of 
New Hampshire, p. 234.) In New Hampshire eighty-two thousand two hundred people 
maintained but one paper. 
  
1 These, as preserved in the Charleston Library, were South Carolina Gazette, 1732 to 1774, nine vol- 
umes, folio; South Carolina American General Gazette, 1766 to 1775, two vulumes, folio; South Caro- 
lina Gazette and County Journal, 1766 to 1774 (See Catalogue Charleston Library). Before these there 
had been South Carolina Gazette, January to September, 1731, two volumes; South Carolina Weekly 
Gazette, 1732 to 1733, two volumes, folio. (Ibid. See also King’s Newspaper Press of Charleston.) 
2 In 1851 Mr. Grecley was examined in London before a select committee ‘of Parliament on news- 
papers, and gave some interesting testimony in regard to the population necessary at that time to 
support a paper, which places South Carolina in 1775 in a very favorable comparative light. He says: 
“In all the free States if a county has a population of twenty thousand it has two—one to each 
party. The general average is about one local journal in the agricultural counties for ten thousand 
inhabitants. A county of fifty thousand has five journals, which are generally weekly papers, and 
when a town grows to have as many as fifteen thousand inhabitants, or thereabout, it has a daily

Connecticut.—In the Encyclopedia Americana the population of the State in 1774 is 
given at one handred and ninety-seven thousand three hundred and sixty-five; and 
it had four newspapers, or one to every forty-nine thousand three hundred and forty 
inhabitants. 
Rhode Istand.—We cannot put our hand upon any estimate of the population of 
Rhode Island before the Revolution with which to compare the circulation of her two 
newspapers. 
Pennsylvania.—From the Encyclopedia Americana we find that the population of 
Pennsylvania in 1782 was supposed to be three hundred and thirty thousand, and as 
she had nine newspapers, she had one to every thirty-six thousand six hundred and 
sixty-six, as nearly as can be approximated. 
Upon this examination, is it not strange that any historian should rashly assert the 
Jack of newspapers in South Carolina in 1775 as an evidence of her neglect of educa- 
tion, and lament her deplorable condition in consequence? 
But if newspapers are the gauge of the education of the people, what does Mr. 
MeMaster say to the fact that though New Jersey had founded and established the 
great institution of learning, Princeton College, in which he was writing his history, 
yet with a population of one hundred and fifty-four thousand one hundred and thirty-nine 
in 1790 (we can find no estimate before the census of 1790), she had no newspaper 
whatever prior to the Revolution ? 
“In 1870,” he goes on to say, ‘‘the population of Georgia in round numbers was 
twelve hundred thousand souls, and the circulation of the newspapers less than four- 
teen and a half million copies. The population of Massachusetts was at the same 
time fifteen hundred thousand, but the newspaper circulation was far in excess of one 
hundred and seven and a half millions of copies.” 
But why stop here? The case, as viewed by him, is infinitely worse than that. 
By the same census to which he refers, that of 1870, it appears that the whole value 
of the products of manufactures in Georgia was but $31,196,115, whereas in Massa- 
chusetts it was $553,912,568. Now, surely, if the people of Georgia have so few man- 
ufactures, by parity of reasoning they must wear very little clothes, and can’t have 
any shoes. We are beginning to remedy this, however. We are already manufactur- 
ing some clothing, and it may be that by the time Mr. McMaster gets through his 
work, we of the South will have begun, too, to have our own press, and to take fewer 
copies of New England and New York journals, and thus curtail to some extent that 
enormous circulation which Mr. McMaster has mistaken as being confined to the 
State of Massachusetts. The whole population of Massachusetts—men, women, and 
children—native and foreign, in 1570, including thirty-one thousand seven hundred 
and forty-six men who were disqualified from voting because they could not read and 
write, was one milliov four hundred and fifty-seven thousand three hundred and fifty- 
one, not exactly the one million five hundred thousand Mr. McMaster makes them. 
Now, does Mr. McMaster believe that these people, invcluding those who could not 
read, were so ravenous for.literature that they consumed sixty or seventy newspa- 
pers apiece annually ? 
And, after all, how unsatisfactory a test of education and literature is this matter 
of the manufacture of periodicals? Do not these figures include flashy pictorial pe- 
riodicals, and even obscene works, which the statutes of Massachusetts through the 
regular officers of the law, and by means of societies incorporated for the purpose, are 
endeavoring tosuppress? A glance at the New York and Massachusetts statutes will 
show that with a cheap press has sprung up the rankest and most noisome food that 
can be administered to the mind—to such an extent that their Legislatures have been 
called upon to suppress it. The Nation has lately been protesting from another stand- 
point—that of free trade—against this idea that literature may be counted by num- 
bers and weighed by the pound. 
It was Carlyle who said that there is a great discovery still to be made in litera- 
ture—that of paying literary men by the quantity they do not write.

230 HIGHER EDUCATION IN SOUTH CAROLINA. 
IV.—Lipraries. 
We think we have fairly met the assertion of Mr. McMaster, that, if the number of 
newspapers printed in any community may be taken as the gauge of the education of 
the people, the condition of the Southern States was most deplorable ; and have shown 
that South Carolina at least may fairly challenge that test. But there is another 
test of the education of a people to which we may refer, and to which Dr. Ramsay 
calls attention in his chapter on the literary history of the State. The establishment 
of libraries, the circulation of books, encouraged by legislative acts and private do- 
nations, are certainly evidences that education was not wholly neglected in the 
Province. 
In the special report of the Bureau of Education (U. S.), 1876, Chap. I—‘ Publie 
Libraries a Hundred Years ago”—Mr. Scudder observes: ‘‘ The idea of a free publice 
library could hardly find general acceptance until the idea of free public education 
had become familiar to men’s minds; and the libraries existing at the time of the 
Revolution were necessarily representative of the existing state of public opinion on 
the subject of culture. They were, with scarcely an exception, either connected 
directly with institutions of learning or the outgrowth of associations of gentlemen 
having tastes and interests in common.” 
Dr. Ramsay, as we have seen in his chapter on the literary history of the State, 
writes that the earliest settlers had scarcely provided themselves with shelter before 
they adopted measures for the moral and literary improvement of themselves and 
their children. ‘‘In the year 1700,” he goes on to say, ‘‘a law was passed ‘for secur- 
ing the Provincial Library of Charlestown.’ This had been previously formed by the 
liberality of Dr. Bray, the Lords Proprietors, and the inhabitants of the Province ; 
and was, by special Act of the Legislature, deposited in the hands of the minister 
of the Church of England in Charlestown, for the time being, to be loaned out to 
the inhabitants in succession, under the direction and care of James Moore, Joseph 
Morton, Nicholas Trott, Ralph Izard, Job Howe, Thomas Smith, Robert Stevens, 
Joseph Croskeys, and Robert Fenwicke, who were appointed commissioners for that 
purpose. * * * From this time forward the circulation of books, the establishment 
of churches, and the settlement of Episcopal ministers in the different Parishes were 
encouraged by legislative acts, private donations, and by the liberality of the English 
Society for Propagating the Gospel.” ! 
Professor Rivers says, in his Early History of South Carolina: ‘ By the efforts of 
the Rev. Thomas Bray, the Bishop of London’s commissary in Maryland, and from 
the bounty of the Lords Proprietors and contributions of the Carolinians, the first 
public library was formed in Charlestown, and placed by an Act of Assembly (Jour- 
nal, 1693) under the care of the Episcopal minister (November, 1700).”? 
In the year 1700, when this public library was inaugurated, there were in the 
Province about 5,500 persons, besides Indians and negroes. What became of this 
library we do not know, but it certainly was in operatién for many years, for in 1712 
another act was passed “ for securing the Provincial Library at Charlestown, in Caro- 
lina,” by which five more commissioners were added, and ether provisions made 
for the use of the books and management of that library, and of other parochial 
libraries.* 
Mr. Scudder in his report gives 1730 as the date of the formation by Franklin of the* 
debating society called The Junto, which grew into the American Philosophical 
Society, and was also the cause of the establishment of what Franklin called the 
mother of all the North American subscription libraries, The Philadelphia Library, 
which was the outcome of the American Philosophical Society, and which by its gen-

eral prosperity and excellent management drew to itself other collections of books, 
was incorporated in 1742. The next library in this country not connected with an 
institution of learning, as appears by this report, was the present Charleston Library ~ 
Society. 
In the preface to its catalogue of 1826, which Mr. Scudder also quotes, this is the 
history given of the Society: 
“The Charleston (S. C.) Library Society owes its origin to seventeen young men 
who, in the year 1748, associated for the purpose of raising a small sum to collect 
such new pamphlets and magazines as should occasionally be published in Great 
Britain. They advanced and remitted to London ten pounds sterling as a fund to 
purchase such pamphlets as had appeared during the current year, acting at first 
under a mere verbal agreement, and without a name. Before the close of the year 
their views became more extensive, and on the 28th of December rules for the organ- 
ization of the Society were ratified and signed, when they assumed the name of a 
library society, and made arrangements for the acquisition of books as well as pam- 
phlets.”! 
The society became odptilee and before the close of the year 1750 numbered more 
than one hundred and sixty members. The society had some difficulty in obtaining 
a charter, very probably, we think, because the Colonial Legislature had, as we have 
seen, of itself undertaken the matter of a Provincial library ; but, however that may 
be, the present Charleston Library Society was incorporated in 1755, 
Josiah Quincy: in his journal, writes : 
“March 9th (1773). Spent all the morning in viewing the public library, State- 
house, public offices, &c. Was accompanied by Messrs. Pinckney and Rutledge, two 
young gentlemen lately from the Temple, where they took the degree of barris- 
ter-at-law. The public library is a handsome, square, spacious room, containing 
a large collection of very valuable books, prints, globes,” ete2 
It will be observed that Dr. Ramsay says that the library, for securing which the 
act of 1700 was passed, ‘‘had been already formed.” Now, the establishment of the 
colony of South Carolina was only in 1670; it was, therefore, before thirty years had 
passed that the settlers of this Province made their first effort to establish a library, 
and that at a time when there were but fifty-five hundred people in the colony, be- 
sides Indians and negroes, and in doing so they were encouraged by public acts and 
private donations. Massachusetts boasts t the library of Harvard is the oldest in 
the country, having been commenced in 16: The colony of Massachusetts was estab- 
lished about 1620. Measured, therefore, by the time of the settlement of the two 
colonies, the Provincial Library of South Carolina was not much later in the history 
of our colony than that of Harvard was in the history of Massachusetts; and if a com- 
parison be made as to the extent of the two libraries, that of Charleston .will not 
suffer. It is remarkable that within a few years both libraries were destroyed by 
fire. That of Harvard was burnt on the 24th January, 1764, and it then contained: 
five thousand volumes. The Charleston Library was burnt 17th January, 1778, and 
it then contained between six thousand and seven thousand volumes.* But the li- 
brary of Harvard was not in any sense a public library. It was the library of an 
educational institution. It was commenced by a devise by the Rey. John Harvard 
of his library to the Wilderness Seminary. 
We had something of the same kind in this colony as early as 1755. The Winyaw 
Indigo Society, which we have already mentioned, though not incorporated until 
1756, was formed about the year 1740 by the planters of Georgetown District, and 
was originally a social club which met once a month to discuss the latest news from 
London and the culture of indigo, the staple product of the country. The initiation 
fees and annual subscriptions of the members were paid in indigo, and as the expenses

were light, there had accumulated in 1753. sum which seemed to require some special 
application. The president of the society proposed that the surplus fund should be 
devoted to the establishment of an independent charity school for the poor, and out 
of this proposition sprung the establishment of the school of which we have spoken, 
and the accumulation of a valuable library, which was added to and maintained until 
destroyed or carried away by the Federal troops on the occupation of Georgetown 
during the late War.! 
Dr. Howe tells of the ‘‘ Dorchester and Beech Hill Alphabet Society,” which was 
another attempt at formation of a library society as early as 1752.2 
V.—OTHER EVIDENCES OF EDUCATION AND CULTURE. 
‘We have shown that during the time in which Mr. McMaster has so unwarrantably 
asserted that education was wholly neglected, our people were founding schools, 
building school-houses, employing teachers learned in the languages, and assistants 
ready at accounts, and paying them out of the public treasury; that they were print- 
ing newspapers far in excess even of Massachusetts; that they were establishing 
public libraries even before Franklin founded that in Philadelphia. But there are 
still other evidences of the education and culture of our people during the period of 
our alleged ignorance. 
In a paper prepared by J. M. Toner, M. D., founder of the Toner Lectures in Wash- 
ington, and published by the Government at the instance of General Eaton, Com- 
missioner of Education, in 1874, Dr. Toner says :3 
«The Carolinas, from a comparatively early period, furnished numerous valuable 
contributions to the literature of medicine and natural history, and for some years 
Ted all the States in the study of the natural sciences * 
“As early as 1738, Doctors Maubray, surgeon in the British navy, and Kirkpatrick, 
introduced and conducted snecessfully general inoculation at Charleston. The prac- 
tice was at various times resorted to subsequently. 
“ John Lining, a native of Scotland, who settled in Charleston in 1730, was an ac- 
complished physician, and published in 1743, Observations on the Weather of Charles- 
ton, and later, An Account of the Excretions of the Human Body. In 1753 he pub- 
lished, in the second volume of the Medical Observations and Inquiries, p. 370, ‘A 
Description of the American Yellow Fever.’ He died in 1760, aged fifty-two years. 
“Dr. William Bull was the first native South Carolina physician of note, and the 
Jirst American who received the degree of M.D. This was granted at Leyden in 1734, 
his thesis being on ‘ Colica Pictorium.’ He died July 4, 1791, aged eighty-two. 
“Lionel Chalmers, a native of Scotland and a well-educated physician, settled in 
Charleston prior to 1740. _In 1754 he published an essay on Opisthotonos and Tetanus, 
and in 1768 an article on fevers, in which he adopted the ‘spasmodic theory.’ In 1776 
he published a work in two volumes on the Weather and Diseases of South Carolina. 
. He died in the year 1777, at the age of sixty-two. 
.“Dr. John Moultrie was the next South Carolinian who received the degree of 
M.D., which was granted in 1749 from Edinburgh. His thesis was ‘De Febra Flava.’ 
“For the ten years intervening between 1768 and 1778, there were ten natives of 
South Carolina who received the degree of doctor of medicine at Edinburgh. * * * 
“Alexander Gardner, a native of Edinburgh, settled in Charleston in 1750. In 1754 
he wrote a description of a new plant—Gardenia®—which is published in the first vol- 
ume of Medical Observations and Inquiries, p. 1. In 1764 he published an account

4 We may add that from that time to this South Carolina has never been without a naturalist of es- 
tablished reputation in the scientific world.

of the Spigelia Marylandica, or Carolina pink-root, and in 1772 a second and enlarged 
edition of the paper in the Philosophical Transactions. He died in London in 1792, 
aged sixty-four.” 
To these we may add Dr. Thomas Walter, a native of England, who settled on a 
plantation on the banks of the Santee, and who published in 1783 botanical.essays— 
Flora Caroliniana, secundum Systema Linnai, ete. . 
Our people, who we are told were without education or culture, were building 
churches, one of which (St. Philip’s, built in 1723), Edmund Burke described as 
‘spacious, and executed ina very handsome taste, exceeding everything of that kind 
which we have in America;”! and the steeple of another (St. Michael’s, built in 
1756), is to-day celebtated for the beauty of its proportions. They were adorniwg 
their spacious mansions? with original paintings of the masters, with life portraits of 
their families by Sir Joshua Reynolds, Allan Ramsay, Zoffany, Romney, Gainsborough, 
Copley, and Stuart.? Dr. Ramsay tells us that great attention also was paid to music,

My Dear Sir: In compliauee with your request I have prepared for you a list of the London artists who were employed by various persons from South Carolina, who were in England during the last century for educitional and other purposes, to paint their portraits. This list contains the names of such noted painters as Allan Ramsay, Zoffany, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Benjamin West, Copley, Gains- borough, and Gilbert Stuart, while the latter was living in London ; and they are a. striking evidence 
of the amount of culture attained by our people during the colonial period, and in the years imme- following the Revolution, when the effects of English education were still perceptible among 
L-to-do classes, 
It is needless to say that the above-mentioned names are those of the most distinguished English 
painters of the latter half of the Eighteenth Century, and, what is more remarkable, is that, with one 
ve all passed unharmed though the devastation of the late War,

and that many arrived at distinguished eminence in its science. To encourage this 
science asociety was formed and incorporated in 1784, which exists to- day asa social 
organization of the highest standing. The occasion and purposes of its incorporation 
are thus stated in the preamble to the act: 
“Whereas, Several persons, inhabitants of this State, have associated themselves 
together, and by voluntary contributions have raised a considerable fun d, which is 
now out at interest on bonds, and collected a number of musical instruments, books, 
and other property, with the laadable intention of, encouraging the liberal science of 
music, and are Gesirous of having the said society incorporated, thereby to put them 
on a more solid and lasting foundation than they could by their voluntary subserip- 
tions only,” ete.! 
Mr. McMaster tells how, before the First Congress had met, the demand had arisen 
that the Federal Government should restrain commerce with Great Britain; should 
restrain importation and encourage manufactures; and how that in every great city, 
from Boston to Baltimore, societies for the encouragement of manufactures had sprung 
up since the war and were flourishing; but he does not consider it worthy of notice to 
mention that the people of South Carolina were at the same time forming societies. 
for the scientific culture of rice and indigo, and for the enlightened advancement in 
agriculture in reclaiming their swamp lands.” 
But why go on rehearsing and arguing? What boots it that the people of South 
Carolina were the first on this continent to attempt a public library ; that they were 
before Massachusetts even in establishing free schools; that prior to the Revolution 
  
  and the Ca were spending the Rinbee in that city. Owned in Charleston by the heirs of the late C.

late H. M. Manigault. 
There was a seventh portrait by Copley—that of Henry Lanrens, president of the Continental Con- 
. gress. Painted in London in 1782. It was destroyed by fire in Charleston in 1861. It was owned by 
the late John Laurens. 
Lhave been careful to exclude from this list any portr: ‘aits about which there seems to be any doubt, 
and consider those enumerated as perfectly Twill add that several of them are quite large paintings and of distinguished merit, especially the first one by Copley, and the Romney. 
During the flourishing period of miniature painting, at the close of the last century and commence- 
ment of the present, many artists in that line found it to their advantage to v Charleston during 
several successive vears. Notably amung these was Malbone, of Newport, R. L.. without exception 
the most distinguished of all the American miniature painters. Ata recent loan exhibition of his por- 
traits, as well as those of others, held in Charleston during the month of April, 1883, there were ex hibited so many by him as to be a matter of surprise, and their excellence may be considered proof 
that his great ability was fully appreciated by those who employed him. Tam giad to be able to give you this information concerning the tastes of our people in by-gone 
years, for the evidence it affords is undeniable, which is that, after having become by their own efforts reasonably prosperous, they were not content with the mere possession of wealth, but sought in every tue was open to them to improve through its agency the condition of themselves and of their 
children.

they maintained, in proportion to the population, more newspapers than New Eng- 
land, and more than Massachusetts? What matters it that South Carolina led alk 
the States in the study of natural sciences, and, to this day, has never been without 
her recognized naturalist; what that by patient toil and careful scientific study her 
people converted swamps and marshes into golden rice fields, and spread the seed 
and culture of cotton from the Atlantic beyond the Mississippi, improving that of 
her sea islands until it has ‘‘surpassed all other description of cotton in the length, 
strength, and beauty of its staple?” What difference does it make that they found 
time to cultivate the muses while draining their swamps, and brought home with 
them from London and Italy paintings which would have been prized in the oldest 
cities in Europe? What that they sent to the councils of their country sons whom 
they had educated at home and abroad for the public service? 
How did it happen that eight out of the thirteen of the Presidents elected were 
from the South, and that five of them were elected twice; the South thus holding the 
office for nearly two-thirds of the time? How did it happen that more than half the 
Judges of the Supreme Court and three of the five Chief Justices were from the 
South? How did it happen that Marshall and Taney were the moulders of the system: 
of jurisprudence of the United States? War is a science. How was it then that the 
uneducated people in the Revolution, in the War of 1812, and in the Mexican War, 
furnished many of the generals that led our armies to victory? How was it that of 
the great triumvirate, Webster, Clay, and Calhoun, two were Southerners? 
For South Carolina herself this is what. Dr. Ramsay, when he wrote (1808), added 
in a note to his chapter on her literary history : 
“South Carolina has furnished to the United States two Presidents of the Rey- 
olutionary Congress; a Chief-Justice and an Associate Judge of the Supreme Court ; 
six diplomatic characters ; a Comptroller and Treasurer ; three general officers for the 
Revolutionary army ; a major-general for the army of 1798, and a brigadier-general 
for the army of 1808. In addition to this, the vote of the State in 1800 might have 
elevated one of its citizens either to the Presidency or Vice-Presidency. With the 
exception of Virginia, no State in the Union has obtained a greater or even an equal 
proportion of national honors. This was in some degree the consequence of the attention 
paid by the earlier settlers of Carolina to the liberal education of their children.” 
And yet this is the author to whom Mr. McMaster refers as his authority for the 
assertion that in the Southern States education was almost wholly neglected, but no- 
where to such an extent as in South Carolina,

Isaran, Chap. LX, ver. 1, and Chap. LXI, ver. 3. 
Arise, shine, for thy Light is come, and the Glory of the Lord is risen upon thee, —— to ap- 
point unto them that mourn in Sion, to give unto them Beauty for Ashes ; the Oil of Joy 
Sor Mourning ; the Garment of Praise for the Spirit of Heaviness ; that they might be 
called the Trees of Righteousness, the Planting of the Lord, that he might be glorified ! 
When we cast our eyes around, and behold a rising generation, the greatest part 
thereof must live in ignorance, on account of there being no place of instruction near 
them, where they can be properly educated: Also, when we behold the orphan left 
forlorn, and the children of indigent parents, growing up more like a race of savages. 
than Christians, becoming thereby useless to their country, to society, and them- 
selves; we cannot help being sensible of those tender feelings which the Divine Being 
hath impressed on our natures, as a spur to prompt us to lend a helping hand to suc- 
cour and assist the destitute. ‘ 
If men will look into their own bosoms, and consider the generous seeds which are 
there planted, that might, if rightly cultivated, ennoble their lives, and make their 
virtue venerable to futurity, surely they cannot, without tears, reflect on the many 
fine geniuses, in the remote parts of this State, who are entirely buried in oblivion,, 
through lack of education. r

Our country calls, nay the voice of reason cries aloud to us, to promote knowledge 
as the firmest cement of a state; and conscience insists that it is our indispensible 
duty to instruct the ignorant in the Principles of Christianity : The more efficaciously 
to do which,— 
WE, whose names are annexed hereunto, have chearfully entered, into a Society, 
at Charlestown, in South-Carolina, the Ninth Day of January, Anno Domini 
One Thousand Seven Hundred and Seventy-Seven, and have agreed to the fol- 
lowing Rules and Regulations for the good government of the same:

IV. Atthe Anniversary and Quarterly Meetings, two Stewards shall be chosen, who 
shall attend every Meeting of the Society, and whose business ‘shall be to order a

relating to the Society, which may be required of them by the President, for the time 
being. Their time in office shall be only three months, and fine for not serving, six

meeting are read—Nor closed till after the reading of the minutes of the then present

in a debate of that kind, or behaves indecently, after being admonished by him, shal]

peace and harmony of the Meeting, on that or any other account, the President shall

MOUNT SION SOCIETY. 239) 
<ommand him to quit the Room, and on his refusing to comply therewith, and not 
making a proper concession for his offensive behaviour, at the next succeeding Meet- 
ing, he shall be expelled the Society. 
The President shall also, at the request of a majority of the Members present, at 
any regular Meeting, sue for any monies that shall be due the Society: and execute 
all other matters and things which shall be thought by the Society to appertain to his 
office. 
VIII. The Senior Warden shall officiate in the sideiit’s absence, and the Junior 
Warden in the absence of the President and Senior Warden. But in case the Presi- 
‘dent and both the Wardens should be absent, the Members present may proceed to 
ballot for temporary officers, who as soon as elected, shall have power to transact 
business for that night, provided thirteen Members are present ; without which num- 
ber no meeting shall be considered perfect, or capable of doing business. 
IX. Any person elected into the office of President, Senior or Junior Warden, Treas- 
urer, or Secretary, and having punctually, regularly and faithfully served the time 
appointed by these rules and regulations, shall not be liable (unless with his own 
consent) to serve in the same or any inferior office the succeeding year. 
X. Once in three years, there shall be also chosen, by ballot, by a majority of 
Members present, at an Anniversary Meeting, Thirteen Governors or Directors, from

ment of the buildings, the appointment of House-keepers and other necessary attend- 
ants; together with the power of fixing their respective salaries, and drawing on the 
Treasurer for monies, with the consent of the Society. 
They shall likewise have authority to agree with the parents or guardians of chil- 
dren, who shall be sent to the school as boarders or scholars, and not on the charity. 
All monies resulting therefrom must be paid by them into the hands of the Treasurer, 
for the use of the General Fund. 
Any person chosen a Governor or Director, who shall refuse to serve, shall forfeit 
three pounds sterling.—The appointment shall be for three years.

thirds of the Members present are for the candidate, he shall be admitted, on paying

but if rejected, he shall not be eligible to be balloted for again, until the full end and 
term of one year.

in one of which he shall enter all the rules, that now or hereafter may be agreed upon, 
together with the names of the members, and the times of their admission. He 
shall likewise keep regular minutes of the transactions at each Meeting, with the . 
names of the Members present; as also, a fair and regular account of entrance money, 
fines, forfeitures, donations, receipts and disbursements of every kind whatsoever ; 
likewise, a file of all letters and copies of letters.—Every other article and expence 
(besides books) which the Society shall think useful or necessary, shall be paid out 
of the General Fund. 
XIII. The Treasurer shall also provide a proper book, in which he shall enter all 
monies received or disbursed; and keep a true state of the fund of the Society. He 
likewise, as soon as elected, shall give bond with security to the Society, for double 
the sum or value of the monies, bonds and other securities then delivered into his 
hands; with condition to be accountable for, and deliver the same, together with all 
other monies or effects belonging to the Society, that may come into his hands during 
his Treasurership (fire and other inevitable accidents excepted) to the next succeeding 
Treasurer, or to the order of the Governors and the Society, when required by a ma- 
 
-P-A-G-E-276
240 HIGHER EDUCATION IN SOUTII CAROLINA. 
jority of the Members at a regular Meeting; which bond shall be kept by the Presi- 
dent, after being recorded in the Secretary’s office. 
All bonds and other securities for money shall be taken in the name of, and made 
payable to, the Mount Sion Sociery. No monies belonging to this Society shall be 
let out at interest by the Treasurer, but with the consent of the President, Senior 
and Junior Wardens and Secretary: And no member of this Society shall be per- 
mitted to borrow any money belonging to the Society, or be security for any other 
borrower of the same. : 
XIV. Every Member who shall be appointed on any committee, and neglects to 
attend at the time and place appointed for the meeting thereof, and at the time and 
place to which the said committee may be adjourned, such Member or Members, so 
neglecting to attend, shall pay a fine of two dollars, unless he or they shall make a 
satisfactory excuse to the Society. 
XY. In order to increase the fund of this Society, every Member shall pay the sum 
of five shillings sterling on every Anniversary and Quarterly Meeting—Any person 
neglecting to contribute such annual and quarterly sums for the space of one year, 
the, Secretary shall publicly read his name with the sum due by him, the next regu- 
lar meeting after the year is expired, and if the same is not paid to the Treasurer, 
before the next regular Meeting, he shall be exeluded. But it is provided, that any 
person who has been so excluded, and shall again incline to become a Member, upon 
being balloted for, and if admitted, shall, on paying into the hands of the Treasurer, 
all the ordinary sums which shall remain due at the time of his exclusion,-and until 
his application for re-admission, be then entitled to the same benefit which he other- 
wise would have enjoyed before his breach of this rule. 
XVI. All fines and forfeitures of what kind soever, arising by virtue of the rules 
and orders of this Society, as also all gifts and legacies by any of the Members, or 
any other person; and all monies accruing to the society, in any other way what- 
ever, shall be appropriated to the general fund.—Likewise the names of benefactors. 
shall be inserted in a book provided for that purpose ; and proper letters of thanks 
shall be drawn up by the Secretary for any donations received, to be approved by 
the Society. 
XVII. All schoolmasters and teachers are to be appointed by the Society at large, 
and are not to be discharged on any account, or for any cause, before complaint shall 
be made, heard, and adjudged to be important and well founded, by the Society, at 
some Annual or Quarterly Meeting—No person shall be eligible to be a tutor in this 
Society’s school, unless he be of Protestant Religion. 
XVIII. The Anniversary and Quarterly Meetings shall be the only time for the ad- 
mittance of children on the Charity, into the School; which after the Governors have 
given six weeks’ public notice in the Gazettes of this State, informing what number 
their fund is able or can afford to provide for, shall be performed in the following 
manner, viz. The children of such indigent Members of this Society, as have been 
Members for the space of five years shall have the preference—The poor orphan shall 
be next noticed; then the child of an indigent widow or widower ; and lastly, the chil- 
dren of such poor parents as the Society shall deem worthy of their bount, 
If the parents of the children are able to find cloaths for them, then the Society will 
find them in board and education; or if the parents of such children live near the 
school, and are able to board themselves, then the Society will find them in cloaths. 
and education. But if the children be orphans, or their parents in very indigent cir- 
cumstances, the Society will then find them in cloaths, boarding and education, until 
they are of a proper age to be put to some trade or profession.—No child whatever 
shall be admitted who is not above the age of five years. 
The names of all children who are candidates for admission, are to be made known 
to the Society three weeks before the Anniversary; and the Governors shall make 
strict enquiry whether they are proper objects of charity or not, and report accord- 
ingly. Such of the children as the Society, on the consideration of the report, shall 
 
-P-A-G-E-277
  MOUNT SION SOCIETY. 241 
adjudge to be proper objects, shall be admitted on the charity. But notwithstanding 
such admission, if the Society shall afterwards find they were deceived, they shall 
make such order on the matter as to them shall appear just. 
XIX. If any Member should die in such low circumstances, that he cannot out of 
his estate or effects be decently interred, the President and Wardens shall have power 
to order all things necessary for his funeral, and the expence shall be paid out of the 
fund of the Society. In case of the death of any Member in town, the rest of the Mem- 
bers, if regularly invited by the person appointed to invite them shall attend the fu- 
neral on the forfeiture of one shilling sterling each unless a sufficient excuse is made 
at the next Meeting; and the Secretary if called upon, shall furnish a list of the Mem- 
bers to the person authorized by the friends of the deceased to invite. 
XX. The expence of the Society, at each of their respective Meetings, shall be de- 
frayed by the Town Members, whether present or absent in an equal proportion; 
which shall not exceed the sum of one dollar per Member, at each Annual and Quar- 
terly Meeting, exclusive of four pence sterling at each of the Weekly ones through- 
out the year. The Country Members are to pay the same ratio also, whenever they 
attend any of the said Meetings.—The President and Wardens shall have power to 
order, or agree for the entertainment of the Society, at each Anniversary and Quar- 
terly Day, not exceeding the aforesaid sums. Any Member giving one week’s nctice 
to the Secretary, of his intention of not attending, shall be excused his fine on the 
Quarterly Meetings. 
XXI. None of the foregoing Rules shall be repealed, nor any new ones made until the 
same has been proposed and delivered in writing, and undergone three separate read- 
ings, at three distinct Meetings, one of which must be a General Meeting, at each of 
which Meetings, it must have met with the approbation of a majority of the Members 
then present. All questions in this Society shall be determined by a majority of 
hands; or by ballot, if any two Members require it, and if the votes are equal, the 
President shall have the casting vote. a 
XXII. That no Member be permitted to speak more than twice to one subject, un- 
less with consent of a majority to explain himself. Ifat any time doubtsshould arise 
concerning the meaning of either of these Rules, the same shall be adjusted and deter- 
mined by a majority of the Members present at any General Meeting of the Society. 
XXIII. Committees (if thoughtnecessary) shall, on application, be permitted to be 
formed by any five gentlemen, Members of the Society, who reside in the Country. 
The business of said Committees, which are to be titled from their local situations, 
shall be, to admit Members into the Society, and receiye such donations, gifts, or 
legacies, as shall from time to time be bestowed or bequeathed to this Society ; like- 
wise to collect all annual and quarterly contributions which shall become due from 
the Members residing in or about their respective neighborhoods, and to do all other 
business that shall be required of them by the Society. They are also to make proper 
returns to the Society, at the Annual and Quarterly Meetings, of their proceedings; 
the names of Members, with the times of their admission, and the sums they have re- 
ceived, so that they may be regularly entered upon the books of the Society. Who- 
ever are appointed officers and refuse to serve, shall pay a fine of fourteen shillings 
sterling, and the Committee shall appoint others, who in like case lie under the same 
penalty. 
XXIV. The Chairman of County Committees shall be appointed annually, and 
shall have power to make bye-laws for their own government, but no power to alter 
or amend these Rules, or to dispose of any monies they may receive for the fund, 
without first obtaining leave from the Society, unless in case of the death of a Mem- 
ber in indigent circumstances; then the Chairman and Members present, shall have 
full power and authority to act agreeably to Rule the nineteenth: And these Rules 
shall be binding and in force with all Committees.

PRESENT CONDITION OF THE COLLEGE OF CHARLESTON. 
The present condition of the College of Charleston is presented in the following 
article taken from a recent number of the News and Courier: 
Among our oldest and most honored institutions the College of Charleston is worthy” 
of especial consideration and regard; and yet it is true that this institution has not 
received, and does not receive, that support from our own people which it deserves. 
No system of general education has ever achieved the highest excellence, or even 
the highest utility, save under the inspiration and stimulus of collegiate and uni- 
versity culture. This truth is most thoroughly attested in educational history. The 
intermediate forms of education have always degenerated into the lowest types of 
mechanism and empiricism when separated from the stimulating power of the college 
and the university. In regard to the merits of the College of Charleston, it is but just 
to say that its work is being accomplished most thoroughly, and that its whole spirit 
is one of progress. It has not assumed the title of university, but its academic stand- 
ard is of a far higher character than that which obtains in many more pretentious 
seats of learning. 
The curriculum of the College of Charleston embraces an extensive course in math- 
ematics, physics, astronomy, Latin, Greek, French, German, history, English lan- 
guage and literature, Anglo-Saxon, rhetoric, and mental philosophy. There are also 
Jectures upon natural history, and the college museum, which is one of the best iv the 
United States, affords admirable facilities for the study of this expanding science. 
The college has an elaborate and continuous course in English, an indispensable de- 
partment, and yet one that is strangely neglected in many of our colleges and uni- 
versities. The Literary Society conneeted with the institution does excellent work, 
and affords a fine theatre for the practical culture of rhetoric and elocution. 
Both wings of the college building were so injured by the earthquake in 1886 that 
they had to be pulled down to the foundation. Offers were made by friends of edu- 
cation in distant cities to raise subscriptions in aid of the institution; but the board 
of trustees thought it their duty to defray the expenses of pulling down and rebuild- 
ing one wing of the college from’ the fund with which the college has been endowed 
by enlightened and liberal donors. > 
The trustees are addressing themselves with earnestness and vigor to the task, not 
only of sustaining the institution, but of increasing its usefulness and extending its 
advantages. 
The new east wing of the college will soon be completed. It is hoped that the 
restoration of this part of the old college building will mark the beginning of a new 
epoch in the life of an institution which is deserving of the cordial and united sup- 
port of the people of Charleston. There is no educational establishment in the State, 
or in the South, which is better equipped for the proper work of a collegiate insti- 
tution. The men who have been graduated from the College of Charleston have not 
only reflected honor upon their alma mater, but have rendered most effective service 
to South Carolina in the fields of literary, professional, and patriotic endeavor. We 
need not send our young men away from home for educational advantages, when we 
have at our doors an institution of so great merit as the College of Charleston. 
Judged by the best standards, the College of Charleston is well fitted to supply every 
young man in Charleston with the advantages of a liberal education.

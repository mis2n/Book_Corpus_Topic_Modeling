  PREFACE 
This manual of vocational and moral guidance is pre- 
pared in response to a demand for more detailed informa- 
tion regarding the work that was originated by the writer 
in the Central High School of Grand Rapids, Michigan. 
The bibliography appended has been compiled with the 
assistance of the Grand Rapids Public Library. Mr. Samuel 
H. Ranck, librarian, has placed every privilege at the dis- 
posal of the writer and has coédperated in the preparation 
of the lists. This bibliography is not exhaustive. The lists 
that have appeared in earlier bulletins have been thoroughly 
tried out. Books that did not prove valuable in the hands 
of the pupils or the teachers have been discarded. The 
attempt has been made to select a few books that were 
adapted to the pupils of the several grades, and that were 
most suited to the purpose of the work in hand. As new 
books are constantly appearing along the lines studied, 
teachers and counselors should be on the lookout for 
up-to-date material in this rather new field. 
Practically no references have been made to periodical 
literature, for it seemed impracticable to attempt a bibliog- 
raphy of this type. It should be noted, however, that 
vocational and moral topics are receiving more and more 
attention in the current magazines. Professional and busi- 
ness journals, too, representing a great variety of vocations, 
contain from time to time articles of value to the student 
el
-P-A-G-E-6
  VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
interested in some particular vocation. All this material 
should be used a great deal by both teachers and pupils. 
Realizing the fact that many localities are ready to begin 
work in vocational guidance, but are not familiar with the 
details of getting the work under way, a collection of blank 
forms, outlines, and reports has been added to show how 
others have attacked the problem. For these the author 
is indebted to the workers who have so readily contributed 
their material for this purpose. 
An expression of sincere appreciation is due to the 
teachers of English in the Grand Rapids Central High 
School who have taken up the work of experimentation 
so sympathetically and so loyally, and whose suggestions 
have proved so valuable in completing the scheme outlined 
in these pages. Special credit is due to the work of one 
of these teachers, Miss Nellie M. Hayes, who has been of 
great assistance in preparing the manuscript of this book. 
The movement for vocational guidance is now in its 
beginning. Each worker is attacking the problem from 
his own point of view. In fact, not all have yet agreed 
upon a definition of the term “vocational guidance.” In 
preparing this manual the writer realizes that much of the 
work suggested is still in the experimental stage, and that 
his own ideas are in a process of constant transformation. 
These pages have been written solely with the idea that the 
suggestions made may be of help in starting others in the 
field of investigation and experiment, and with the hope 
that the ideals set forth may prove to be an inspiration 
to all readers who may be interested in the vocational and 
moral guidance of youth.

CHAPTER I 
INTRODUCTORY 
The secret of success in life is for a man to be ready for his 
opportunity when it comes. — DISRAELI 
Why do from fifty to seventy-five per cent of the pupils 
who enter the high school lgave before graduation? Why 
do fifty per cent of those who finish the eighth grade or 
meet the requirements of compulsory education never enter 
the high school? What are the causes of failure to do 
passing work in the high school? What causes underlie 
certain conditions made evident in student life by the kind 
of outlawry and disorder that indicates a lack of loyalty to 
- the school and an antagonism toward authority? These 
are questions that educators have been asking and discuss- 
ing for many years. {Some will answer that the school does 
not offer what certain pupils need and, therefore, that they 
either leave or remaitt a restless and disturbing factor in 
the school.) This is undoubtedly true as far as it goes, but 
it does not tell the whole story. The introduction of voca- 
tional courses in the high school and the establishment of 
industrial and trade schools will hold many of those pupils 
who have heretofore dropped out, and will keep their in- 
terest for a time. However, a little deeper study into the 
answer to these questions will show that the foundation of 
the difficulty lies in the problem of getting the pupil into 
[3] 
 
-P-A-G-E-12
VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
the right school, starting him in the right course of study, 
and giving him an aim that will hold his interest. 
In spite of the fact that so large a percentage of our 
pupils do not enter the high school and that so many drop 
out before graduation, high schools are universally crowded, 
and but few cities have been able to erect buildings fast 
enough to meet the demand for secondary education. This 
increasing desire for training beyond that of the grammar 
school is introducing new problems into the field of sec- 
ondary education. The high school of to-day is a very dif- 
ferent institution from that of ten, fifteen, or twenty years 
ago. The course of study has been revolutionized.) Teachers 
of long experience claim that they cannot maintain the 
high standards of scholarship that they formerly held. The 
very composition of the school itself has undergone a great 
change, and in this fact lies the basis of our difficulty, The 
high school was originally a preparatory school for college 
or university. Then, the pupils who attended were from 
the well-to-do families and were looking forward to the 
learned professions. To-day, the pupils are from all manner — 
of homes and represent every nationality; they are of vary- 
ing types of mentality and are destined to follow widely 
differing walks in life. The great problem of the cosmo- 
politan high school or of secondary education in general is 
to assimilate this great mass of students who are sent on 
every six months to be prepared, not necessarily for the 
college or the university, but for the work-a-day world as 
well. This means, again, the problem of adjusting the in- 
dividual pupil to the right school, the right course of study, 
and the right aim in life, according to his peculiar qualities 
and abilities, 
[4]

    INTRODUCTORY 
The great demand for vocational guidance has arisen, 
from the evidence of so great a number of misfits in life. 
Vocation bureaus are doing a noble work in helping these 
poor unfortunates to adjust themselves and to start over 
again in a more fitting vocation. How much more worthy 
the demand to prevent the existence of these misfits! Un- 
doubtedly the public. schools are guilty of causing many of 
these unhappy failures in life. The transformation that is 
at present taking pl@ge_in our educational system is big 
with possibility for the future generations, but we must 
remember that the changes are being made in the interest, 
not of. industry, nor of commerce, nor of professional 
careers,‘but in the interest of the individual child, that he 
may become a self-supporting, contented worker, successful 
according to his ability, and useful as a loyal citizen in his 
community. 
It is with this great transformation in our public school 
system in mind that the plan of vocational and moral guid- 
ance olitlined in this volume is set forth. If by means of 
theuggestions made, some lives may be led into right 
paths ; if the methods of the schools may be made to savor 
less of the middle ages and more of modern life ; and, if 
the revolution that is bound to come in our system of edu- 
cation may be brought about without upheaval, this volume 
will have performed its mission,

  CHAPTER II 
THE PROBLEM OF VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE IN 
THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
The true teacher finds his crowning opportunity in revealing to his 
students some appealing career and compelling purpose which shall 
be to them what teaching is to him. — ANon. 
( Much of the failure and disappointment in life and 
possibly much of the crime that abounds may be attributed 
to the fact that so large a proportion of our youth go out 
from our public schools imperfectly prepared to meet the 
demands of the world in which they find themselves com- 
pelled to make some kind of a living. Accepting as suffi- 
cient for all purposes the elementary training that the law 
may force upon them, a vast army of children, several 
million strong, drop out from our public schools every year 
to enter the fields of unskilled labor. Drifting about from 
one occupation to another, they seem to mix themselves 
up about as unsatisfactorily as if some superhuman power 
had shaken them up in a mighty deal box and had thrown 
them in every direction. All about us we find men strug- 
gling along in occupations for which they have no liking 
or fitness. A mechanical genius is wasting his time at 
the law, and many a physician would have" made a better 
farmer. The unskilled laborer is chafing at his task and 
rarely can see that his real need is the education that will 
lift him out of his thraldom. (hat the world is filled with 
[6] 
 
-P-A-G-E-15
    
VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
men and women who have not found their proper places 
in life, who have not risen to the highest that their abili- 
ties demanded, who have not made use of the power for 
service that it was their privilege to seize) is a self-evident 
truth. Thoughtful people are seeing that our public school 
system, as efficient as it may be to-day, is under some 
obligation to this vast throng of unfortunates, who may 
be considered, in part at least, as victims of its neglect. 
The fact that the public schools have failed to meet the 
needs of the masses is a result of antecedent conditions 
from which the secondary schools have been slow to free 
themselves. Higher education in this country was founded 
for the ministry and slowly broadened out to include the 
other learned professions. The academies and high schools 
were expected to prepare students for the universities. 
Only in comparatively recent years have the universities 
extended their courses to include engineering and other 
special departments, and, even with the opening of these 
wider fields of opportunity, they have allowed the entrance 
requirements to remain dominated by the traditional aca- 
demic curriculum. As a result, the high school course of 
study is still under this powerful influence, and much of 
its work is preparatory for professional rather than for 
industrial or commercial life. 
The wave that is now sweeping over the country for 
more of the practical in education is forcing upon the high 
school a very difficult situation. While the large high school 
of the city is attempting to meet this demand, it must be 
remembered that the present excellence of the high school 
curriculum is due to that very dominance of the college that 
it is now attempting to throw off. Whatever the changes 
val ; 
  
-P-A-G-E-16
  
die VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
that may be made, each zew subject must meet a standard 
of educational value that is the equal of any part of the pres- 
ent curriculum. When this has been accomplished, and not 
until then, should the high school demand that the college 
accept these new courses as a preparation for entrance. 
But what about the high school as a preparation for en- 
trance into the great university of the world’s activities ? 
Modern business has developed most wonderfully along 
all lines ‘during the past decade and is now demanding 
trained men with no less preparation for their life work 
than that of professional men.{ Business methods have 
been reduced to a science, experts are required for all 
lines of progress, and efficiency has become the key word 
to success,) Large corporations are looking for young 
men whose ability and training have given them the power 
to grow in their work. From the fact that so large a pro- 
portion of the graduates of the public schools do not enter 
professional life or even go to college, but go out into the /. 
wide ‘world-of-busirress~opportunity..without.chart or com- // 
pass, we must realize that the traditional curriculum i 
failing to meet the requirements of modern civilization. 
In the light of the present demand for efficiency in all 
undertakings, the by-product or waste of the public schools 
is sufficient to force them into bankruptcy and to demand 
the appointment of a receivership. With approximately 
ninety per cent of those who enter the first grade dropping 
out before the year of graduation from the high school, 
there must be some real and practical reason for their de- 
liberate action. While many may leave for causes beyond 
their control, my observation and investigation show that 
fully sixty per cent of those who leave the high school do 
[8]   
-P-A-G-E-17
  VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
so because it does not offer them what, in their opinion 
and experience, they need for the work that they desire 
to enter or feel that they are called to do. (Not having 
been given a vocational aim, Bey drift into si oek job that 
offers, and in the school of “ hard knocks” they stand or 
fall without the aid that the schools should have given them./ 
The great majority of men now past middle age will 
testify that they came into their present occupation almost 
entirely by chance. Very few can say that they had a 
definite ambition and planned to reach a certain goal. 
The history of most men is one of drifting — drifting 
through school as far as they went, drifting into the first 
occupation that seemed to offer immediate returns, drifting 
from one thing to another until some fortune, good or bad, 
fixed them at one occupation for the remainder of their 
years(/Those who succeeded to a comfortable position in 
so largely as a result of moral character rather than 
ing —as a result of favorable influence and oppor- 
tunity rather than of schooling.} Those who are living un- 
happy lives of discouragemeng and failure were possibly 
lacking in moral qualities and may not have had an equal 
opportunity. The fact remains that in the lives of most 
men there has been a great loss of time and energy in 
the search for their place in the world’s work. The main 
cause for this great economic loss may be laid at the door 
of our public schools.(We have failed to inspire our youth 
with the necessity for an aim in life. We have held out 
the ideal of education as a means to professional careers, 
and have ignored the fact that the right sort of study in 
preparation for other careers is just as worthy and just as 
: necessary as for those designated by high-sounding titles)

In response to these demands the curriculum is rapidly 
undergoing changes that are somewhat revolutionary in 
| character. Colleges and universities are hastening to meet 
the conditions that secondary schools are placing before 
them as a righteous demand of the people who support 
the schools. W hat the future content of the high school 
curriculum will be is not yet fully worked out. However, 
it can be seen that the practical side of life is to have its due 
consideration. Improved gommercial and industrial courses 
will be evolved, (and wider opportunities will be given our 
boys and girls to choose their training and to prepare for 
broader fields of service} Yet this will not of itself solve 
the problem of securing for the individual the particular 
line of training that may be best for him, for it will be seen 
at the outset that this very opportunity of immature pupils 
to make such a choice, brings us face to face with a most 
serious problem. The so-called “elective” system was 
the beginning of the movement for pupils to follow what 
seemed most profitable to’/them, and the success of this 
system has often been called in question. However, the 
old curriculum was so dominated by purely academic sub- 
jects that a pupil finding himself on the wrong line of 
study could change about without very serious loss in his 
preparation for his future work. But the recent introduc- 
tion of technical and commercial courses, and in many: 
cities of trade or industrial schools receiving pupils at from 
fourteen to sixteen years of age, will force many pupils to 
make a very positive choice of a career very early in life. 
Having once decided between an academic course, a busi- 
ness, or an industrial course, the pupil will find that they 
diverge more widely as the work goes on, and that the 
[10]

possibility of changing means an ever increasing loss of 
time and work. Hence, of all the problems that have 
been placed upon the public schools for solution, there is 
none more difficult, more fraught with danger, or more full 
of splendid possibility than that of guiding each boy and 
each girl into the course of study or the kind of school 
that will best prepare them for that particular field of service 
in which they may be most truly successful.

  CHAPTER III° 
THE PROBLEM OF MORAL GUIDANCE IN THE 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
Religion, morality, and knowledge being necessary for good gov- 
ernment and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of 
education shall forever be encouraged. — Ordinance of 1787 
The first public schools established in America were 
particularly strong in religion and morals, and from the 
modern point of view very meager in the field of knowl- 
edge. A glance over the records and textbooks of the 
early days will show the strongly religious trend of teach- 
ing. Noah Webster’s Spelling Book of the edition of 
1843 contains a Moral Catechism, which bases its teaching 
upon the authority of the Bible, and treats of humility, 
mercy; peacemaking, purity of heart, anger, revenge, jus- 
tice, generosity, gratitude, truth, charity, avarice, frugality, 
industry, and cheerfulness. Selections for reading were 
chosen for their patriotic or moral sentiment rather than 
for their literary or informational value. Indeed, every 
source of information regarding the early history of educa- 
tion in this country indicates that the chief aim of all 
teaching was moral and religious. 
Since the Civil War the entire history of our country 
has changed in a most astonishing manner. We may be 
too near, even yet, to see clearly what it all means. But in 
all wazxs of life — commercial, industrial, and educational 
[13] 
   
-P-A-G-E-22
  
    VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
—we have witnessed great changes. To-day our schools 
are crowded with such a mass of subjects, such a variety of 
information — scientific, industrial, and historical — that 
both teachers and pupils are overwhelmed with its volume. 
No wonder that we have forgotten religion and morality 
in our effort to cram the youthful head with all the prog- 
ress of the most wonderful age of the world’s history. 
Our public schools are not unmoral nor have they entirely 
eliminated religion from their teaching, but we have’ given 
up in a large measure the attempt to develop systematically 
the moral and religious nature of our pupils. Individual 
teachers are still the inspiration of many lives, but we have 
not yet brought this most important side of our work up to 
the scientific standard of all our other teaching. Whether 
those who go forth from our schools to-day are weaker in 
moral character than those of the early days can never be 
proved. Just how much of the immorality and indifference 
toward religion of the present age can be charged to the 
public schools cannot be determined. CN evertheless the 
standards of moral conduct, the ideals upon which honest 
living and sound business stand, are the ideals of the public 
schools}, We are, however, coming to realize that some- 
thing More than an occasional or accidental method of 
applying ethical lessons is necessary. 
If experience in the schoolroom did not bring about this 
realization, a closer relationship between the school author- 
ities and the employers who receive their product, would 
soon force educators to see that graduates of the public 
schools are not prepared for business life without having 
acquired definite moral qualities. Principals and teachers 
are constantly being asked to answer letters of inquiry and 
[14]
-P-A-G-E-23
  
  MORAL GUIDANCE IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
to fill out blank forms regarding the qualifications of some 
graduate or former pupil who has used their names for ref- 
erences in applying for some position of trust or responsi- 
bility. Among the questions asked are the following: 
  Has your acquaintance with the applicant been sufficiently inti- \ 
mate for you fersonally to judge his character and habits? 
To the best of your knowledge does the applicant use, or has he 
ever in previous years used, intoxicating drinks, tobacco, morphine, 
or opium? 
Does he use vulgar or profane language? 
Is he industrious, careful, thorough, honest, truthful, trustworthy ? 
Have you ever heard that the applicant was suspected of intem- 
perance, gambling, speculating, extravagance, dishonorable conduct? 
Do you consider the applicant a safe and proper person to be 
guaranteed by this company, and one whom you would yourself 
trust ?+ \ \ 
\ 
\ 
| 
/ 
The character of these questions indicates the fact that \ 
employers and bonding companies are vitally concerned 
with the moral qualities of applicants. I have often been 
called upon to. find a young man for a certain position. 
When I asked the employer whether he wished the appli- 
cant to know certain things, he invariably replied, ‘‘ We 
in 
eee 
eal 
will teach him the things we wish him to know. What I | 
want you to do is to help me find the night kind of a | 
Jellow.” Further evidence of the demand of industry and / 
commerce for moral qualities is found in the following 
questions taken from application blanks : 
Are your habits sober and temperate? Have they always been so? 
Do you use liquor or narcotics of any kind? If so, what? 
Do you use tobacco; smoke cigarettes? 
1 The Personal Record Press of Kansas City, Missouri, has prepared 
a splendid chart of these questions and others for the use of schools, etc. 
[15] 
  ‘diss
-P-A-G-E-24
VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
Have you ever played cards for money or engaged in any other 
form of gambling? 
Have you ever “played the races” or speculated, and do you 
now occasionally speculate ? 
Have you any tastes or habits which are Seeeen in proportion 
to your means? 
Have you ever been convicted of any crime or misdemeanor or 
arrested on any charge? ‘ 
These application blanks would show from their content 
that the employer is far more concerned with the character 
of the applicant than with his record of scholarship. It 
suggests that we ask ourselves the question, ‘“‘ With which 
are we more concerned?” 
If it were possible to make a study of. the causes of the 
failures that men make of their lives, — and by failure I 
do not mean the mere loss of money, — such an investiga- 
tion would probably reveal to a startling degree the moral 
weaknesses of the human race. Each thoughtful man, 
from such data as he may have at his command, can esti- 
mate that nearly every person who makes a failure of his 
life opportunities, is at fault in some point of character. 
his being true, we should expect business men and em- 
ployers to be even more interested in the moral guidance of 
'/ youth. And we certainly should expect the public schools 
(I consider it an essential part of education for efficient 
living, systematically to teach youths the obligations of life, 
its moral code, its obstacles and pitfalls, and the necessity 
of rightly adjusting themselves to its social relationship: 
For a number of years there has been an increasing 
interest in this problem of moral instruction in the public 
schools. The National Educational Association has a com- 
mission at work upon a plan for such instruction; the

its attention during the past two years to the problem; 
and several state associations have appointed committees 
to make investigations. Indeed, educators are, quite - 
erally awakened to the importance of the question. Ge 
whenever an attempt has been made to introduce the 
reading or study of the Bible into the schools as a means 
of moral instruction, objections have been raised and laws 
passed to prevent the action.) 
In some progressive schools more or less formal courses 
in moral ethics have been introduced with varying success. 
To work out a plan of moral instruction that would reach 
all pupils and give time for real development in their lives, . 
that could be applied in concrete form to daily practice, 
and that was not so formal as to become perfunctory and 
uninteresting, has been the great difficulty. But light has 
been thrown upon the problem of moral instruction through 
close study of the problem of vocational guidance. It is 
not often that in trying to find a solution for one problem 
one happens to work out a plan that proves to be an equally 
satisfactory solution of another perplexing question. Yet, 
upon thought, all will grant that vocational guidance is in 
itself moral, and that moral guidance without application 
to life’s purpose is of little value — the two are insepara- 
ble. Moreover, to young people of this generation, the 
strongest plea for morality is in its close connection with 
their own possible chances for success in life. 
In the plan outlined in the following pages it will be 
seen that the word “ guidance” has a broad significance. 
From the vocational point of view, it means the gradual 
unfolding of the pupil’s better understanding of himself ; 
[17] 
 
-P-A-G-E-26
  VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANGE 
it means the opening of his eyes to the broad field of op- 
portunity in the world; it means a’seiection of and a 
preparation for his own best field of service as a social 
being. From the moral standpoint, the idea of “ guid- 
ance”’ is peculiarly essential in the development of the 
pupil. Ethical instruction that merely informs the brain 
does not necessarily produce better character. It is of 
most value when it is in some way applied to the actual 
thinking and acting of the pupil. tm this connection guid- 
ance means the pupil’s better understanding of his own 
character ; it means an awakening of the moral conscious- 
ness that will lead him to emulate the character of the 
good and great who have gone before; it means a con- 
ception of himself as a social being in some future occuy 
pation, and from this viewpoint, the appreciation of his . 
duty and obligation toward his business associates, toward 
his neighbors, and toward the law.)

CHAPTER IV 
THE PLAN 
In vocational guidance the school finds its supreme task as the con- 
scious educational institution of a democracy. — GEORGE H. MEAD 
The plan of vocational and moral guidance suggested 
here is the result of many years of experience in dealing 
with individual pupils, and of definite experimenting for the 
past five years. In beginning the work the department of 
English was selected for several reasons. In the first place, 
to be effective the work-must reach all pupils throughout 
their course; the subject of English alone offered’this op- 
portunity. In this particular high school, oral and written 
composition forms about one third of each semester’s work. 
Teachers were often puzzled to find live composition topics 
. that would insure both originality and interest. A sug- 
gested outline of subjects involving vocational and moral 
guidance for each semester was prepared and developed 
as experience pointed the way. The amount of time to be _ 
devoted to these themes was left to the choice of the 
teacher and to the opportunity to fit the work into the 
course as previously prepared. This plan still proves to 
be better than to prescribe a certain amount to be done 
each week or each day. Teachers will find that it will not 
do to push, any topic beyond the point of real, spontaneous 
interest. The greatest value to be obtained from this entire 
plan is serious thought upon the part of the pupil regarding 
[20] 
 
-P-A-G-E-29
  
THE PLAN 
himself and his future mission in the world. Just enough, 
then, must be done to make him desire more, and never 
should he become tired of the subject. Under the inspi- 
ration of the wise teacher the day or period set apart for 
the vocational themes will be looked forward to as the 
bright spot in the work. 
Not all subjects lend themselves to the general discus- 
sion of vocational or moral topics as does English composi- 
tion. However, every branch has its practical application 
to certain vocations and often to certain moral issues. 
These opportunities are always grasped by the earnest 
teacher who is doing something more than giving instruc- 
tion in a certain subject. If the subject is made to serve as 
an instrument in the hands of the teacher for the purpose 
of molding the life of the pupil, the greater purpose of 
education will be obtained. 
The following story is very much to the point and worth 
repeating. It is the story of an artist who was sitting in 
his studio, his eyes fixed in steadfast gaze upon a vision 
which had risen before him, It was a form of rare beauty 
—a form more beautiful than his eyes had ever beheld 
before —a conception so wonderful in its loveliness as to 
transport his whole being. His frame thrilled with ecstasy 
as he continued to gaze upon it, and there came to him an 
overwhelming desire to grasp that form and make it live 
forever. He seized a lump of clay, and while his fingers 
were yet trembling with -the frenzy of his inspiration, he 
began to mold. He pressed in here and he pressed out 
there. He gave a firm touch here, a tender touch there. 
Day after day he molded on. When the clay hardened he 
moistened it and molded again. And by and by there grew 
[20] 
 
-P-A-G-E-30
  } 
\ VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
up from his hands a form so beautiful that the world heard 
the fame of it, and came and looked upon him and upon 
the work of his hands, and said to him, ‘‘ Well done.” 
After a day of toil and worry a teacher once sat alone 
at twilight, her eyes fixed in steadfast gaze upon a vision 
that had risen before her. It was the most beautiful, the 
rarest, the most charming form that had ever blessed her 
eyes. As she looked she recognized the face of ‘‘ Him 
who is the fairest among ten thousand, and altogether 
lovely.” Her whole being was filled with the blessed vision. 
Her heart yearned toward Him. She threw herself at His 
feet and gave herself, heart and soul and mind, to Him. 
And when she rose there came into her heart an irresistible 
desire to mold some life like unto Him. And she took 
into her hands a lump of living clay —a little child — and 
trembling with the frenzy of the vision she began to mold. 
Day after day she taught and trained the little mind and 
the little heart, pressing in here, and pressing out there ; 
firmly here, tenderly there. When the child began to grow 
hard, her love and sympathy softened him and she molded 
on, And by and by there grew up from her hands a strong, 
symmetrical, manly man. The world heard not of what she 
had done, and came not; but the fame of her workman- 
ship reached the court of heaven, and one day the Lord 
came down and looked upon her and upon the work of 
her hands, and He said to her, ‘t Well done.” 
\\This vision of the teacher: gives to us a suggestion of 
the mission within our profession. {It is the teacher who 
has caught this vision that is eager to grasp each oppor- 
tunity and suggestion so to conduct her work that it will 
be something more than a brain-cramming process) 
[22]
-P-A-G-E-31
  THE PLAN 
Public schools are becoming “social centers” not only 
for the community, but also, more and more, for the social 
life of the pupils. This fact presents one of the most dif- 
ficult problems of school administration. Educators have 
changed their attitude toward student activities from that of 
prohibition to indifferent toleration, and now are awakening 
to the great opportunity that those social instincts afford for 
the development of moral character and social efficiency. 
Therefore the plan set forth in this volume aims also to 
guide the youth by means of the social opportunities of 
the school, realizing that in this phase of school life there 
can be a direct application of the moral principles and so- 
cial requirements that, in class discussion, have been found 
essential to vocational success. 
The plan does not and cannot stop with the public 
schools. (The work of guidance begins with the schools 
because it is the place where the children are to be found, 
and where the work of preparing them for the battle with 
the world must begin. Our responsibility for the welfare 
of our pupils does not cease when they drop out of school 
or even when they have been graduated. We are under 
obligation to see that they start out upon the right path, \ 
as far as we are able to discern it, when they leave the | 
schoolhouse door.) The shipping department of a great 
factory is not the least important of the departments. 
Our schools have often been called factories with more or 
less aptness, and we have been running for a long time 
with a very incomplete shipping department. Our aim 
has been to ship all of our product to the colleges. We 
have sifted out about ninety per cent as culls, thrown 
them upon the waste heap, and packed the chosen ten 
\ [23] 
    fe
-P-A-G-E-32
  VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
per cent in de luxe wrappers of sheepskin and labeled 
them “for college recommendation.” The ninety per cent 
now demands attention. The waste product must be 
turned into profit. The demands of the industrial and 
commercial markets must be studied ; our ‘‘ experts” must 
, show us the best use of this redeemed product, and aid 
us in placing it upon the market to the greatest advantage 
of all concerned. This is the application of the principle 
of business efficiency to the public-school system, The 
placement, or vocation, bureau is planned to perform this 
function for the pupils who may leave school at any time 
before completing the course, as well as for those who re- 
main until graduation. This bureau will also serve the 
entire community as a place for the adjustment of those 
who have taken wrong paths in occupations and who de- 
sire to be directed aright. It is further hoped that in 
time the bureau will bring about the same close relation- 
ship of the school system with the business world that now 
exists with the higher institutions of learning. Then we 
shall know wherein we fall short and by what training we 
can best prepare our pupils to meet the actual demands 
of the world. 
The outline of oral and written composition in English 
suggested in this volume has been adapted to the needs 
of several trade schools. Teachers who are conducting 
the various forms of vocational schools in the country find 
that the satisfactory teaching of English is one of their 
most perplexing questions. The boys and girls who have 
left school to go to work and who return to the continua- 
tion school are there for very practical reasons. They have 
no interest in mythology, classic lore, or the history of 
[24] .
-P-A-G-E-33
  
THE PLAN 
English literature. They come from homes of toil, of 
little leisure, and of less culture. They have no time to 
lose, and every lesson must have its application to present 
needs. 
While we deplore the lack of culture and refinement 
upon the part of these workers, we must not deceive our- 
selves into believing that all culture and refinement are to 
be found in the traditional material and methods of our 
accepted course of study. We must learn how to reach 
these students, beginning with their interests and abilities 
as we find them. By using the journal of the trade or 
business in which they are employed, we can secure their 
interest and teach them to interpret what they read. Then 
we can lead them “on through modern literature dealing 
with industrial problems out into a broader field of litera- 
. ture that will bring to them a more certain culture than 
we have been able to do with our former methods. 
Such an outline of reading may be easily worked out by 
the teacher who is interested in the lives of the pupils 
who come to the vocational school. Using the outlines 
and topics suggested in the following chapters as a basis 
of the work in composition, the course may be made to fit 
into the needs of the part-time school, the trade school, or 
the longer course of the technical or commercial school. 
This brief description of the plan includes all of the 
steps which together form what may be called vocational 
and moral guidance. No one part of the scheme should 
stand alone under that name.€Summing it up it means 
that we should first guide the pupil through education to 
prepare himself morally, intellectually, and physically for 
that vocation for which he seems to be best fitted by 
[25] 
   
-P-A-G-E-34
  VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
nature, ability, and opportunity Secondly, it requires that 
when the time comes for him to begin the actual struggle 
in the fields of labor, we should still be ready to guide him 
—at whatever age he may be when this event arrives — 
into the occupation which may appear to be best suited to 
his needs, and in which he will probably give the greatest 
satisfaction to his employer. This complete plan defines 
the use of the title ‘‘ Vocational and Moral Guidance.”

CHAPTER V 
VOCATIONAL DIRECTION IN THE GRADES 
*Tis not what man does which exalts him, but what man would 
do. — BROWNING 
Not failure, but low aim, is crime. — LowELL 
Under present methods of school administration, life 
decisions are being forced upon the great majority of 
pupils before they have reached years of discretion and 
before they have gathered sufficient data from which to 
make any important deduction. Whether the pupil goes 
on into a trade school or a high school, or goes to work 
upon leaving the grade school, he is called upon to take 
a step which determines, almost to a certainty, the gen- 
eral line of occupation which he is to follow through life. 
Teachers have individually tried to help the child to take 
the step when the actual moment arrived, but few teach- 
ers have had a broad enough vision to point the way very 
far or very wisely. Furthermore, teachers have had little 
opportunity or incentive to broaden their own vision of the 
world’s work, and we have all failed to begin early enough 
to prepare the children for the moment when these great 
decisions have to be made. 
The academic curriculum of the grades does not give 
very much opportunity to the child to test out his abilities 
except in certain narrow lines. The small amount of man- 
ual training ordinarily offered gives very little chance to 
[27] 
geen , 
 
-P-A-G-E-36
  VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
observe the motor abilities or aptitudes of the pupils. 
However, the recent establishment of the ‘‘Junior High 
School” system, with departmental organization for the 
seventh and eighth grades, presents a splendid opportu- 
nity to offer prevocational work. It is through this scheme 
that a rounded opportunity for the pupil to fixd himself 
may be given. 
All pupils in these grades should pursue the fundamental 
branches of English grammar and composition, arithmetic, 
and geography and history as the three main divisions of ~ 
the curriculum. Then each one should have an opportu- 
nity of a single or double period every day in some pre- 
vocational course. The aim of this course should be in 
the main to determine the pupil’s natural aptitude in some 
vocational line and to discover at the earliest possible 
moment any pronounced lack of ability.) In this way a 
change can be made to some other line until the best 
possible opportunity for success is discovered. In general 
the prevocational lines should be academic, offering Latin 
or German ; commercial, offering mental arithmetic, pen- 
manship, and spelling; and industrial, offering special 
courses for girls in needlework, cooking, etc., and for boys 
in mechanical drawing and the elements of both wood and 
metal working. I wish to emphasize again the purpose of 
this prevocational work. The instructor must not let the 
desire to make a fine showing of handwork done, nor the 
ambition to make the course lead up too rapidly to some 
trade or technical course, overshadow the more important 
result that the pupil find his fitness or unfitness for the 
kind of work undertaken and that he get into the right 
line of endeavor as soon as possible. 
[28]
-P-A-G-E-37
  
VOCATIONAL DIRECTION IN THE GRADES 
With a curriculum broad enough to try out the possible 
abilities of a pupil, a system of tests can be introduced to 
prove the type of mind possessed by a certain child, and 
its development during the period of observation. This 
kind of child study ought to prevent many of the educa- 
tional wrecks which our schools are guilty of permitting. 
And again, many a child may by this means receive the 
inspiration that will lead to a successful and happy career. 
The system of testing pupils in arithmetic, devised by 
Mr. Stuart A. Courtis, of Detroit, Michigan, is very sug- 
gestive of the methods and possibilities of systematic 
effort in this line. Similar methods may be applied to 
tests in memory, observation, nerve reaction, motor abil- 
ity, etc. The work’ of Hugo Miinsterberg of Harvard, in 
applying psychological tests in sifting out the misfits in cer- 
tain industries, is also suggestive of what may some day 
be applied to those preparing to enter certain professions 
or to study for certain vocations. This whole field of. in- 
teresting investigation is before us, and positive results 
may be expected very soon. 
To aid in the collection of data needed by the teacher 
and vocational counselor, a card system for recording 
certain facts and observations is suggested. Each pupil’s 
card should be retained in the school in which the obser- 
vation has been made, but when the pupil leaves to enter 
another school a duplicate should accompany him to that 
school, or, in case he goes to work, a duplicate should be 
sent to the office of the vocational director! The cards 
shown on the following page will illustrate the nature of 
the information that has been found useful in practice.

VOCATIONAL DIRECTION IN THE GRADES 
Equally important with the testing of the aptitudes and 
abilities of the pupil is the broadening of the vocational 
horizon of both the teacher and the pupil. The complaint 
that teachers are too academic, too far removed from the 
workaday world, and too little in sympathy with commer- 
cial and industrial conditions, is based upon a reasonable 
amount of truth. The average teacher has very little 
opportunity to: observe or to know from experience very 
much about the vast fields of labor into which her pupils 
go. She may have tried to keep up to date by reading, 
but her training has been narrow, her prejudices are strong, 
and her inclination is toward more pleasant fields of in- 
vestigation. She is anxious to know all she can about the 
higher institutions of learning into which’ a few of her 
pupils may enter. She ought to feel an even greater obli- 
gation to know more about the commercial and industrial 
institutions into which many of her-pupils are destined to go. 
The pupil must also have an opportunity to broaden his 
' vision of the great call of the world. He must be lifted 
out of his narrow environment that his ambition may be 
aroused, that he may catch a glimpse of the vast fields of 
labor that are before him, and that he may possibly find 
in the outlook some compelling purpose that will lead him 
to success. 
Every boy and girl reaching the seventh or eighth grade 
ought to expect to be something or somebody worth while 
in the world. If you ask these children what they imagine 
that will be, you will find that very few have stopped to 
think much about it. Some are quite ready to say that they 
are going to be policemen, street-car conductors, firemen, 
or what father, uncle, or neighbor is. The uniform, the 
[31] 
   
-P-A-G-E-40
~ 
  VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
importance of the man in the eye of the child, or the ad- 
miration of hero-worshiping youth, all play an important 
part in forming vocational ideas at this period. A very few 
hold these ideas until they are realized, yet those who do 
are almost uniformly successful in their callings. 
Some yeais ago a certain newspaper in one of the large 
cities of the country canvassed all the children in the 
grammar grades of that city, asking them to answer the 
one question, ‘“‘ What are you going to be when you grow 
up?” The result was in some respects not just what would 
have been guessed. Fourteen per cent were going to be 
bookkeepers, twelve per cent policemen, nine per cent 
farmers, seven per cent artists, eight per cent engineers, 
five per cent carpenters, fifty-one per cent teachers, and 
four per cent were scattered among firemen, conductors, 
dressmakers, soldiers, sailors, etc. From the point of view 
of vocational guidance this summary places great responsi- 
bility upon the influence of the teacher, and also proves 
the need of opening the eyes of these pupils to a broader 
vision of the world’s work and of arousing within them a 
desire to emulate not only those of their immediate ac- 
quaintance and observation, but those who have achieved 
success in many fields of human service. 
The ideals and ambitions expressed by these children 
were nothing more than imitations of their elders whose 
lives had made an impression upon them. Imitation is 
a powerful influence in every one’s life and is especially 
strong in children. This factor should not be ignored in 
the attempt to inspire them with a worthy vocational aim. 
The boy returning from the circus aspires to be an acrobat 
or a clown, and for days mimic circuses are repeated in

VOCATIONAL DIRECTION IN THE GRADES 
the back yard or on the playground. The influence of the 
“dime novel” and other’ cheap literature portraying the 
adventurer of low moral standard is too well known in 
the records of juvenile crime. Since, then, it is so evident 
that the actions of boys and girls may be determined by 
what they see and read, we should not neglect the oppor- 
tunity to place before them, by every means at our com-' 
mand, that influence which will arouse within them a 
lasting desire to imitate the boys and girls, the men and 
women, whose achievements have been worthy of emulation. 
For many children, life has been a happy play time and 
very little impression has been made that is of a serious 
nature. We are glad when childhood can be made happy 
and care free. But there are also many upon whose little 
shoulders have come burdens more weighty than they ought 
to carry. Life to them is already dark and threatening. 
These, even more than any others, we should attempt to in- 
spire with a vision of their own possibilities, showing them 
how many a boy or girl has found a way out from circum- 
stances even harder than their own to successful careers. 
SUGGESTED OUTLINE OF WORK FOR THE 
SEVENTH GRADE 
AIM: VOCATIONAL AMBITION 
While the process of testing the ability of the pupil 
may be conducted in every subject, the serious attention 
and thought of the pupil can best be obtained in his read- 
ing and his exercises in English composition. Geography 
and history offer splendid opportunities for broadening the 
pupil’s vision regarding the world’s work, and teachers 
[33] 
 
-P-A-G-E-42
VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
should be encouraged in directing their work along this line. 
Teachers of English grammar and composition will find the 
following types of themes for oral or written work suggestive 
of what may be done to arouse the ambition of the pupil.

SUGGESTED OUTLINE OF WORK FOR THE 
EIGHTH GRADE 
Aim: THE VALUE OF AN EDUCATION 
As in the seventh grade, the opportunity of English 
composition forms the background of the work in voca- 
tional direction. Every pupil who reaches the eighth grade 
is approaching a crisis. State laws and traditional gradu- 
ating exercises suggest to the pupils and to many parents 
that, when this goal has been reached, the absolutely 
necessary qualifications for success in life have been met. 
Statistics prove that a very large percentage of boys and 
girls leave school the moment the law will permit them to 
- go to work. Often this is necessary. In many instances, 
when the schools fail to supply their special needs, it may 
be best that certain ones leave to find training of a different 
nature. On the other hand it is far from certain that those 
_ who remain in school are taking up the work for which 
- they are best fitted, and we find them very rapidly drop- 
ping out of the high school to seek their way in the world 
of toil. It is our duty so to present the value of some form 
of education or special training to these eighth-grade pupils 
that they will take the next step wisely. For some it will 
be the academic high-school course; for’ some, the com- 
mercial ; and for others, the industrial or technical course. 
For still others it will be a continuation or part-time course 
in preparation for some trade. And again, for some it may 
be the seeking of an employment in which there is an op- 
portunity to learn, and to work up into a worthy occupa- 
tion. The pupil must be prepared, as far as it is possible, 
in his own consciousness for these steps. He must be

made to think, and to think seriously upon his own prob- 
lem. The following themes for oral and written composi- 
tions are suggested for this purpose.

to go to work before they are sixteen years of 
age? fourteen years of age? before they finish the 
eighth grade? Should boys or girls under sixteen 
be permitted to work more than eight hours a day? 
after six o’clock at night? in theaters? as messen- 
gers? at any time where liquors are sold?

~ ‘The school that can obtain a working library is very 
fortunate, and every effort should be made to place in the 
hands of the pupils the right kind of books. A certain 
amount of reading should be required, but the voluntary 
interest in inspirational books should be encouraged. The 
German system of a reading hour in which the pupil is 
required to read, but is free to select his book from the 
shelf, is worthy of imitation. As a rule, public libraries 
are very willing to codperate with the schools in supplying 
a good amount of material. The teacher should always be 
supplied with a few books essential to the work in vocational 
guidance. 
One of the most helpful aids to the work will be found 
in Saturday morning or Friday afternoon vocational excur- 
sions. One week may be for the girls and the next for 
the boys, if it does not seem best always to plan the trips 
together. Within a reasonable distance of every seventh- 
grade and eighth-grade building are usually found a variety 
of interesting industries that are worth visiting. A class in 
geography that is studying the great wheat regions might 
plan a series of trips as follows: (1) to a grain elevator, 
(2) toa flour mill, (3) to a large bakery or biscuit company’s 
plant, and (4) to a wholesale grocery. Another class that 
is studying the mining districts might visit (1) a smelter, 
[42]
-P-A-G-E-51
  VOCATIONAL DIRECTION IN THE GRADES 
(2) a foundry, (3) a machine shop where tools or dies 
are made, and (4) an iron or steel working factory. Many 
other trips can be planned to illustrate the class work and 
incidentally to broaden the vocational outlook for both 
teacher and pupils. 
The use of the stereopticon and moving-picture machine 
opens up a wide field of instruction that is the best substi- 
tute for the weekly excursions. When interesting speakers 
can be found to give illustrated talks on various vocations, 
it is well to use them, but it must be remembered that not 
all are able to hold the interest of the pupils or to present 
the subject in a simple and practical manner. 
For presenting the value of an education to pupils in 
the eighth grade, older boys or girls, who have been out of 
school for several years and have come back to get the 
education that they have learned they must have if they 
would succeed, are the most valuable speakers. Older high- 
school boys as coaches for grade athletic teams, when of 
the right type, may wield a most powerful influence in the 
lives of younger boys. This field of service proves a train- 
ing school in leadership for the older boy and an uplifting 
influence for the younger ones. Such a plan can be ex- 
tended to leading orchestras, conducting debating clubs, 
and directing other social activities among younger pupils. 
We have no right to shift all responsibility upon others 
for the welfare of those pupils who leave school upon or 
before completing the eighth grade. The fact that the 
large proportion of these stop before they have completed 
the fifth grade indicates that they are not, as a rule, normal 
children. Most state laws say that pupils shall not leave 
school to go to work before they are fourteen, and not until 
[43]
-P-A-G-E-52
  VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
sixteen unless they have special permission or have com- 
pleted the eighth grade. Those who are between fourteen 
and sixteen years of age and have not reached the seventh 
grade are in all probability subnormal children. Their 
problem is a special one of direction in: prevocational train- 
ing and of careful placement in vocations for which they 
may have some little aptitude. The subnormal child, so 
long as society permits the causes of his existence, will 
necessarily fill the ranks of unskilled labor. These children 
must be directed into such employment as will give them 
the best opportunity to make the most of their lives, to 
save them from pauperism and crime. This opens up a 
large field of social service to the Vocation Bureau. The 
teachers or counselors in each school building must co- 
operate with the Vocational Director in the matter of 
placement and of following up these boys and girls. * , \\ . 
Considering the pupils who remain beyond the legal 
requirements, we find that they too at this same age are 
making decisions that may prove to be of life-lasting im- 
portance. The American people have had great faith in 
the value of the public schools. So great has been this 
faith that parents and pupils alike seem to believe that 
the much-coveted diploma from the high school will prove 
an “open sesame ” to success in life. This has not always 
proved to be true. With the extension of the elective sys- 
tem in the modern high school, and in many cities with 
the academic, commercial, and industrial high schools each 
bidding innocent youth to enter its doors, we are compel- 
ling them to make a choice of paths that may or may not 
prove to be best for them individually. The prevocational 
child study suggested for the seventh and eighth grades 
[44]
-P-A-G-E-53
  VOCATIONAL DIRECTION IN THE GRADES 
in the junior high school for the purpose of discovering 
the pupil’s abilities, aptitudes, type of mind, or any pecul- 
iar defects of mind or body should be used in assisting him 
in deciding upon either a school or a course of study. 
One of the chief obstacles in the way of vocational di- 
rection of boys and girls is the prejudice, indifference, or 
ignorance of some parents in regard to the best interests 
of their children. The parents must be interested and 
educated in regard to the opportunities before their boys 
and girls. Parents’ meetings, visiting the home in special 
cases, distribution of pamphlets, and all available means 
must be used to bring parent, pupil, and adviser together 
in order that the best interests of the child may be served.

  CHAPTER VI 
. THE ELEMENTS OF CHARACTER THAT MAKE 
FOR SUCCESS IN LIFE 
Of all knowledge, the wise and good seek most to know them- 
selves. — SHAKESPEARE 
Lives of great men all remind us we can make our lives sublime. 
— LONGFELLOW 
Upon entering the high school a new epoch in the life 
of the boy and girl is begun. New studies are attacked, 
new teachers must be met, a new system must be learned. 
New friendships will be formed, and a new view of life 
itself will soon be formulated. At this same time a physi- 
cally different boy and girl are being developed. The 
period of adolescence is presenting mysterious and pe- 
culiar changes that neither parents nor teachers have 
understood as they should, and in nearly nine cases out 
of ten the youth knows little or nothing that is true re- 
garding his own development. (From every point of view 
this is the most important epoch in the mental, moral, 
and physical growth of the pupil) 
To adjust himself to all of these new conditions, when 
at the same time he does not know himself, is a most diffi- 
cult task. The way should be made plain and the tasks 
should be adapted to the attendant conditions. It is not, 
however, the purpose of this chapter to attempt a discussion 
of the problems arising from the period of adolescence nor 
[46]
-P-A-G-E-55
  THE ELEMENTS OF CHARACTER 
of the difficulties attendant upon the first year in the high 
school. Attention is merely called to these influences in 
the life of the pupil in order that the purpose of the work 
outlined for this grade may be better understood. 
/ in the grammar school the pupils have been led through 
{the first two steps in the course. A desire to be the kind 
| of man or woman that is worth while may have been aroused 
within them. The seed has been planted. They have 
studied the value of an education, and those who have 
entered the high school show by their presence that they 
have profited by the teaching and are ready to prepare 
for a successful career. 
| Success in life to these boys and girls is a gilded picture 
\of many colors. No two pictures are quite alike, yet each 
is made up from the many impressions that have come 
into their lives. Before they attempt to make a choice of 
a definite career they should obtain some clear idea of 
what real success is. It is with this in view that the 
first-year topic is ‘‘ Elements of Character that make for 
Success in Life.” 
During the first semester the subtopic chosen is “ Self- 
analysis.” This analysis is not, as the name might sug- 
gest, for the purpose of finding vocational tendencies, but 
is largely designed to reveal the pupil to the teacher or 
counselor, and incidentally to himself. Experience has 
proved that too close self-analysis for some pupils at this 
particular age is apt to make them morbid. For this 
reason the themes selected for composition should avoid 
too close introspection. 
Both discussion and counsel should be of an encourag- 
ing, hopeful, upbuilding character. If wrong habits of 
[47] } 
   
-P-A-G-E-56
VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
study, play, or living are discovered, a plan for overcoming 
them by the acquiring of better habits should be carried 
out. By clearing the way of stumbling blocks, a real 
foundation for life may be built at this impressionable, 
formative period more easily than at any other time. 
The money-making tendencies of the age and the pre- 
vailing social worship of the rich are responsible for wrong 
ideals and ideas of success among boys and girls. False 
standards of life, of character, of play, and of friends are 
to be avoided at this time of entrance to the high school. 
At no time in the pupil’s life up to this point has there 
been the same need of wise counsel. Therefore, if the 
reading and study of the pupil is directed into lines that 
will correct some of these unfortunate standards, that will 
point out to him his weaknesses and show him how to 
overcome them, and that will establish in his mind worthy 
ideals regarding the kind of achievement and the kind 
of life that constitute real success, —if these things can 
be accomplished, — then a strong beginning will be made 
in laying the foundation of a right career. 
Parents and teachers are familiar with the self-satisfied 
philosophy of the adolescent youth. He knows just a little 
more than his elders about almost any subject that may 
come up for discussion. He has heard some rather start- 
ling, but not new, statements regarding the easy road to 
success. The shrewd tricks of the sharper appeal to him 
as clever and indicating a kind of genius. He even im- 
agines that he might, by some “lucky strike,” win both 
wealth and fame. This bumptious period does not always 
last long, but requires careful handling. When understood 
it is not unnatural nor is it to be wholly deplored. The 
[48] 
 
-P-A-G-E-57
  THE ELEMENTS OF CHARACTER 
coming manhood or womanhood is trying its strength, just 
as at this same pericd the growing muscles are being tested 
and tried out in the gymnasium or on the athletic field. 
Now, above all other times, must budding manhood and 
womanhood be most carefully nurtured. The social in- 
stincts just beginning to develop must be guided and 
guarded sacredly. 
(In attempting to direct boys and girls, one of the things 
to remember is that we are all imitators of those whom 
we admire. We may not be conscious of the process, 
yet men have been described as the composite of all of 
those who have directly or indirectly made some impress 
upon their lives QV ecannot be too careful of the associations 
and friendships that we make, as each contact will leave 
its effect upon us either for good or for ey). The pupil’s 
range of friendships may be limited by circumstance or by 
environment over which he has little control, but he should 
be shown that there is.a vast store of acquaintanceship and 
even close friendship in the records of the lives of the 
great and the good who have gone before. With the world’s 
heroic men and women as inspirations; no fear need be 
entertained that the tendency to imitate will lead the boy 
or girl astray. Right ideals of what constitute real success 
can thus be established. The main object of the reading, 
theme writing, and discussion should be to bring these 
young lives into touch with the truly great and good. In 
studying the life of any great man or woman the object 
in this course should be to seek out those elements of 
character — habits, virtues, and faith— which stand out 
prominently as the very foundation of their success, and 
without which they would not have been called great. 
[49] 
 
-P-A-G-E-58
  VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
A splendid class exercise can be made by having each 
pupil prepare from his reading a list of the virtues pos- 
sessed by the successful men and women studied. Then 
let each one select and hand in on a slip of paper what 
he or she considers the four or five fundamental elements 
of character that make for success. Placing the result upon 
the board will reveal a wide diversity of opinion. A very 
forceful lesson in moral ethics can be taught by having the 
class reduce this list through free discussion to the smallest 
number of virtues that can be agreed upon by all as essen- 
tial to a successful career. 
Pupils are prone to accept precepts and moral truths as 
a matter of course without permitting them to sink into 
their consciousness to any perceptible extent. For this 
reason it is hoped that the very practical appeal of ambi- 
tion to succeed in life will in some degree make the desired 
impression. (Che teacher must have faith in the possibili- 
ties of her pupils if she is to inspire them with faith in 
themselves. To discourage a pupil or to make him lose 
confidence in himself is unworthy of a true teacher. Re- 
gardless of his recorded failures the pupil must be inspired 
with hope and must be strengthened with self-respect, if 
success is to be gained. He must be led to believe that a 
successful life is his and that he has been placed in the 
world for a ae 
Preparation for fis mission is the reason that he is in 
school. He is studying, playing, and living that he may 
become a successful man, not merely an animal. The dif- 
ference between a prize animal at an exhibition and the 
man who wins in life is purely a moral and intellectual 
one. It is the character of the man that distinguishes him, 
[50] 
 
-P-A-G-E-59
THE ELEMENTS OF CHARACTER 
and it is upon this foundation that every successful career 
must be erected. (Theodore Roosevelt has said, ‘‘In the 
long run, in the great battle of life, no brilliancy of intel- 
lect, no perfection of bodily development, will count when 
weighed in the balance against that assemblage of virtue, 
— active or passive, — of moral qualities, which we group 
together under the name of character.”

ing attorney, an attorney for the defense, and the 
class acting as a jury. Let some individual be ac- 
cused of one of the following actions, tried, and 
sentenced according to the verdict: smoking ciga- 
rettes on the school ground, on the street one 
block from the school, down town with a crowd 
of high-school boys; forging a parent’s name on 
an excuse for absence; pitching pennies “ for 
keeps” on the school ground; handing in to the 
editors of the school paper an “original” story 
which has been copied from an old magazine; giv- 
ing the system of signals of the football team to 
a member of a rival school team; stealing another 
pupil’s problems for the purpose of copying them 
to hand in as his own; deliberately marking on the 
white walls of a new school building with a pencil ; 
some act of questionable conduct which has recently

  CHAPTER VII 
THE WORLD’S WORK —A CALL TO SERVICE 
I hold every man a debtor to his profession; from the which as 
men of course do seek to receive countenance and profit, so ought _ 
they of duty to endeavor themselves, by way of amends, to be a help 
and ornament thereunto. — Bacon 
Few people have any conception of the magnitude of 
the world’s work. Most of us circle about within our own 
little sphere of action seeing and knowing little of the vast 
extent of human endeavor. Of no class of citizens is this 
more true than of the school teacher. Reared and trained 
in the school atmosphere, seeing the world mainly through 
the books of the past, teachers are poorly prepared to give 
chart and. compass to the youths who are being sent out 
into the most complex civilization of all history to make 
their future way in the industrial and business worlds. 
When school authorities awake to a realization of the 
greater function of the public schools, the training of youth 
will be so conducted that the outlook for the young man 
or young woman who is graduated will be broad enough 
and clear enough to show each the particular field of labor 
in which he or she may be of greatest service to humanity. 
Some years ago I had occasion to question the boys of 
a certain city high school regarding their aim in life. I 
made a special study of 531 boys, who were asked to 
answer a number of questions as honestly and carefully 
[62]
-P-A-G-E-71
  THE WORLD’S WORK—A CALL TO SERVICE 
as they possibly could. I have every reason to believe that 
the results obtained are as accurate as is the judgment of 
the average high-school boy. Of the 531 boys in all grades 
of the high school, 240 had decided upon some vocation. 
From the 291 who had not arrived at any decision in the 
matter, 194 had tried to do so, while 97 boys had made 
no effort at all. Of these, 235 said that they would like to 
have advice on the subject, leaving 56 who were apparently 
indifferent to the question. This evidence alone was suffi- 
cient to show that there was a great need of vocational 
guidance in the school. 
A further study of the 240 who had made a decision 
gave still more interesting data. In asking them how they 
came to this decision and by whom they were influenced 
in making the choice, I found that 105 cases were prac- 
tically settled by parents. So far, the teachers had influ- 
enced only 26. Companions had led 33 to do as they were 
going to do; 59 had chosen a certain vocation because 
some relative or friend in the occupation had made it at- 
tractive to them; and 23 had arrived at their conclusion 
without the aid of any one. This proved that the parents 
were the dominating factors, that the teachers were not 
making full use of their opportunity, and that many pupils 
were making life decisions without any proper guidance 
or influence. Because of a sad experience in my own life, 
I asked what knowledge they had of the vocation they had 
chosen. Out of the number, 47 had worked during vaca- 
tions or at other times in the occupation they had decided 
upon; 34 knew something about the vocation because 
their parents or relatives were in it; 36 had spent some 
time reading and studying about their choice; and 123 
[63 ] 
 
-P-A-G-E-72
  VOGATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
confessed that they had no real knowledge of the vocation 
that they had determined to enter. Of the 240 who had 
made a choice I found that 150 were selecting their studies 
in accordance with a plan to prepare for their life work, and 
that 90 were still drifting along without any idea of how 
they might best make their schoolwork help them to realize 
their ambition. Partly as a matter of curiosity on my part, 
I asked what purpose they had in mind in choosing a par- 
ticular vocation. One answered, “‘ For service” ;_ 19 were 
after ‘‘money”’; 85 merely “ preferred” or “liked” that 
one best; 39 really thought they were better “fitted” for 
it than anything else; 19 wished to enter the same work 
with their parents; and 77 could think of no purpose in 
particular except to make a living. 
A study of the choices that were made by the 240 boys 
gave evidence of a rather narrow vision of the world’s 
work. Not more than thirty different vocations were named. 
About one third of all the boys were going to be engineers 
of some kind. Most teachers of mathematics would agree 
that of these a good number could be wisely guided into 
different lines by an investigation of their natural ability 
in that subject. Twenty-two were looking toward the law, 
and twelve had decided to take up farming. A few were 
interested in manufacturing, and those remaining were 
scattered among other familiar occupations. Altogether 
the investigation gave much evidence of a need of better 
guidance in the choice of a vocation. 
{ ~ Before discussing the problem of choosing a vocation we 
| should come to a better understanding regarding the use 
\of the term “vocation.” There was a time when it was 
‘believed that the only one “called” to his life work was 
[ 64 ] ” 
   
-P-A-G-E-73
  THE WORLD’S WORK—A CALL TO SERVICE 
the minister. To-day the promoters of industrial education 
have usurped the right to apply the term ‘ vocational” 
to their special field, and now it is the factory hand and 
.the mechanic alone who are favored with the ‘‘calling,” or 
vocation. However,.we shall use the term as applying A 
every alae in| n_which an individual.may fn the ful- 
to a certain work is oe appreciated by the man who baowe \ 
that he is doing the work for which he is best fitted by | 
nature — work in the performance of which he finds the | 
greatest satisfaction, and in which he feels that he is best | 
serving his fellow men. It matters little what this work 
may be; there is plenty to be done. Ways of achievement 
are open to all, rich and poor, educated and humbly 
trained ; in professions, in business, in industry, and on | 
the farm; in the high places of power and influence, and | 
in the modest cottage that shelters a home of warmth and | 
love. Each one who listens with a responsive heart may | 
hear the call to service. - 
This call may come late or it may come early, depend- 
ing upon the maturity and peculiarities of the individual. 
The earlier in life that one can solve the problem, the 
better ; but there should be no undue haste in the matter. 
Parents and teachers must learn to be patient with those 
who try but cannot make up their minds to a choice. One 
step at a time is all that we can take, and it is sufficient for 
those who have no special talent or genius, to work ahead 
in the light that they have by improving each opportunity 
as it comes. If they are ready, the work will find them. 
However, if one is to know his work and to see the 
opportunity when it comes, he must be familiar with the 
[65 ] } |   
s 
 
-P-A-G-E-74
  VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
world’s work round about him and the opportunities that 
may lead to his special field. In assisting pupils to dis- 
cover their life work, teachers or counselors will find it 
necessary to use every means of broadening their own as 
well as their pupils’ vocational horizon. By mingling with 
those of other occupations, we who are teachers can get 
their viewpoint of life and labor. We can take our pupils 
on weekly trips to local industries and business houses ; 
we can bring successful men and women to tell them of 
their vocations ; we can direct their reading and lead their 
discussion in ways that will be of great assistance to them 
and incidentally of growth to ourselves. 
Material for the study of vocations that is in a form 
adapted to the use of the uninitiated inquirer is very 
difficult to find. There is an abundance of technical ma- 
terial for the one already in the vocation, but it is rather 
unintelligible to the average reader and does not give the 
information desired. The Women’s Educational and In- 
_ dustrial Union of Boston has prepared a number of valu- 
able pamphlets on vocations for women. The vocation 
bureaus of Boston, Buffalo, and some other cities are also 
preparing pamphlets on various vocations, for the use of 
either boys or girls who desire to study the vocation with 
a view of entering it. Several books are now in press in 
answer to this demand for information regarding vocations, 
and additional material is certain to appear from time to time. 
For the help of teachers and pupils the following classi- 
fication of vocations is made. It is impossible to present 
anything complete or exhaustive. The classification is 
crude, but is offered merely as a suggestion of similar 
classifications that may be prepared as class exercises.

of successful living. No girl is educated unless she has 
received some training either in the home or at school in 
the household arts,/To make a happy home should be 
the ambition of every growing girl. This does not mean 
merely to be married. Many a girl wage earner is the life 
and center of a contented home. Women have entered 
the fields of business and industry in rapidly increasing 
numbers, until to-day the millions of workers are distrib- 
uted among nearly all of the occupations in which men 
are engaged. Women have earned the right to an inde- 
pendent position, and through education and training they 
are preparing to meet the issues of life on the same footing 
with men. To-day it is of as much importance for the girl 
to consider the choice of a vocation as it is for the boy. 
With this purpose in view the following suggestive classi- 
fication is given.

CHAPTER VIII 
CHOOSING A VOCATION 
(me latest gospel in this world is, know thy work and do > 
RLYLE 
Choosing a life’s work is undoubtedly the most difficult, 
if not the most important, task in life.) It may be for this 
reason that so many men do not attempt to make a choice, 
but simply drift along with the current, hoping to stumble 
on success, and continually grumble because some one else 
seems to be more fortunate. 
Few men have decided early in life upon a definite 
ing, held themselves to it, and prepared themselves for 
it. Those who have done so have usually attained what 
may be considered a sucéessful =) The vast majority, 
however, do not begin to think of thé problem until they 
leave school. This means that when the time for training 
is past they start out without chart or compass, and with- 
out having taken serious thought of the direction in which 
they should go. As a result they take the first work that 
offers. If this does not suit their taste or promise to pay 
well, they change about, trying to find a more favorable 
opening. Many never find what they are looking for. 
Some learn to adapt themselves to circumstances, stick 
to the one line, and by force of character attain success. 
On the other hand, the evidence of the misfits in life — 
the broken-spirited, the discouraged, the rebellious, and 
[75] 
 
-P-A-G-E-84
  VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
discontented men — is sufficient to impress upon educators 
and all others interested in human welfare the need for 
more serious consideration of the problem. 
“ he young man attempting to choose a vocation rarely 
es! himself into serious consideration. As a rule he is 
thinking only of the vocation as an abstract thing, looking 
at it as a means of gaining wealth, honor, or position. He 
sees other people making a success in that vocation, and 
as they have done well he imagines that he too would like 
to do the same kind-of work. 
I can never forget the enthusiasm with which I per- 
suaded my parents to allow me to change my course of 
study in the high school to the preparatory engineering 
course. Some of my acquaintances had been reading 
scientific journals. We were told that we were living in 
an age of electricity and invention. We believed that 
great fortunes were lying in wait for the electrical engi- 
neer. Our eyes were all upon the future—the gilded, 
distant future. We did not know much of the path that 
led to that brilliant future, and we did not give a single 
thought to our own individual fitness for the career. Out 
of a very large group of high-school boys who at that time 
held the same vague ambition, but one is to-day an engi- 
neer. Gradually each of the others found out his own 
unfitness or discovered his own peculiar adaptability and 
changed to other paths. In my own case, and doubtless 
with each of the others, much valuable time and energy 
was at least misdirected if not wholly lost. The one part 
of this experience that I cannot forget is that many sleep- 
less nights and worried days might have been avoided, if 
some one could have aided me in applying my anxious 
[76]
-P-A-G-E-85
CHOOSING A VOCATION 
thoughts to myself. Had I followed the very clear line of 
experience that stood out so preéminently in my life through 
high-school and college days, I never should have reached 
my senior year in college, as I did, without knowing what 
I ought to follow as a life work. This, I believe, is the 
experience of the majority of men. 
The maxim engraved on the Delphic temple, ‘‘ Know 
thyself,” was used by Socrates as fundamental in his teach- 
ing of youth. He is reported as having said, ‘‘ Know thy- 
self, that is, realize thyself; be in fact, what thou art in 
possibility ; satisfy thyself, in the only way in which true 
self-satisfaction is possible, by realizing in thyself the law 
which constitutes thy real being.” We must turn back 
to the wisdom of the ancient philosopher if we are to 
approach our present problem successfully. True self- 
satisfaction is real success, and this can be obtained only 
by discovering that law which constitutes one’s real being. 
How is one to know the law which constitutes one’s be- 
ing? We think that we know our friends, our relatives, 
our neighbors. We imagine that we know ourselves. But 
to attempt to put on paper a searching description of one’s 
self will often reveal much that would not otherwise be dis- 
covered, Certain experiences and qualities developed may 
indicate a certain special aptitude or may point to some 
general tendency that will be a valuable aid in choosing a 
vocation. One’s weaknesses in character or education will 
be shown most effectively by writing down one’s own 
estimate of one’s achievement. The strong points may be 
placed in opposition to the weak ones, and by striking a 
balance one may pass judgment upon one’s self. This 
process has been most carefully worked out by the 
[77]

pioneer counselor, Mr. Frank Parsons, in his book entitled 
“ Choosing a Vocation.”

Students often find it difficult to fill out this blank with- 
out the help of the counselor. The answers given will 
suggest other questions to the skillful adviser who can lead 
the pupil on to a better understanding of himself. Then 
he will be ready for the second step in the process of 
choosing a vocation —that of applying the result of his 
analysis to the study previously made of the vocational 
opportunities. The pupil must ask himself, ““ Where in 
the list will my ability, my tastes, my aptitudes, my temper- 
ament, my training, my character, find their greatest oppor- 
tunity for service?” If his self-analysis does not seem to 
point definitely toward any given vocation,—as it will not 
[80] 
 
-P-A-G-E-89
  
CHOOSING A VOCATION 
with a majority of boys and girls in the second year of the 
high school,— then it may be best to approach the question 
by a process of eliminating the lines for which he is evi- 
dently unfitted. In this way one can usually decide at least 
whether the line of immediate action should be toward the ~ 
commercial, industrial, or professional field. This may be 
all that is necessary for the average boy or girl in school, yet 
this much is demanded if any definite, practical prepara- 
tion is to be made before finishing the high-school course. 
Any attempt to force pupils to make so important a de- 
cision at so early an age may be criticized. For some pupils 
it may be well, indeed necessary, to put off this decision 
as long as possible. However, we must remember that 
the vast army of boys and girls who leave school before 
graduation, or even before finishing the grammar school, 
are making a most positive life decision. No harm can 
come of considering the problem in all seriousness. The 
decision of to-day may be changed in six months, a year, 
or in several years, but if the decision is made toward a 
definite goal, there is naught but gain. Those who fail in 
school, those who fail in business, are those who are con- 
tent to drift and who have no goal in view for which to 
fight. Therefore, the teacher or counselor makes no grave 
mistake in urging a boy or girl seriously to attempt to 
make a choice, provided that boy or girl has taken the pre- 
liminary steps leading up to this period; namely, holding an 
ambition to be somebody worth while in the world, realiz- 
ing the value of education as a preparation for efficiency, 
knowing the power of character-in bringing success, hav- 
ing eyes and heart open to the call to service, and searching 
his innermost being to find its most worthy expression.

CHAPTER 1X 
PREPARATION FOR ONE'S LIFE WORK 
I know of no more encouraging fact than the unquestionable ability 
of a man to elevate his life by conscious endeavor. — THOREAU 
At this point the pupil or applicant for vocational ad- 
justment is understood to have analyzed his own vocational 
tendency, to have made a study of the fields of endeavor 
that seem to open to him the best opportunity to make 
use of his powers, and to have come to some conclusion 
in regard to the vocation which he intends to follow. He 
must now direct his attention to the problem of preparing 
himself, to the best of his ability, to meet the requirements 
of that particular occupation. 
It will be found, even in the eleventh grade or third 
year of the high school, that there are some who will be 
unable to come to a positive decision in this matter. As 
suggested at other periods in this study, it is not best to 
force a pupil to a decision regarding a vocation if he is 
not fully ready to make up his mind. However, the school 
curriculum and college-entrance requirements compel the 
pupil to follow certain lines of study that lead to one of 
several vocational fields, namely, professional, commercial, 
or industrial. Therefore, for the purposes of this discus- 
sion each pupil is supposed to have chosen a definite voca- 
tion or is classified as aiming toward some branch of one 
of the general fields just mentioned.

VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
While the pupil’s course of study has been planned 
since the beginning of the high-school course, it may 
now be necessary to go over the ground again, and to 
make such changes as may be necessitated by the more 
mature decisions made regarding a career. The definite 
college, university, or technical school must be chosen, as 
the time left for preparation in the high school is limited. 
The special requirements for entrance must be known. 
Catalogues of the leading institutions should be at hand. 
A selected library made up of books dealing with various 
vocations, describing the preparation required for success 
and the qualities of character that make the way in the 
vocation easier, should be placed at the command of the 
pupil or inquirer. This material is not easily found, yet 
the demand for vocational guidance based upon sufficient 
data is bringing into form many pamphlets and articles 
that will soon supply the need. 
One cannot know too much about his vocation before 
he has actually entered the field of action. He should 
make use of every opportunity that offers to know some- 
thing about it. He may find more or less material to read 
and should, as a subscriber, if possible, be familiar with 
the periodicals that are devoted to the field of his chosen 
vocation. He should make the acquaintance of some one 
in the vocation to whom he can go with his hopes, his 
plans, and his problems. For the young man over sixteen 
years of age, the summer vacation, instead of being wasted, 
can be spent very profitably in some work connected with 
. his future vocation. In this way, better than in any other, 
a more perfect insight into the desirability of the work, 
the life one must lead, and one’s fitness for the vocation 
[86]
-P-A-G-E-95
  
PREPARATION FOR ONE’S LIFE WORK 
can be gained. Such an experience may prove to be of 
greater value in the process of fitting one’s self for one’s 
vocation than any other. Often it is advisable to spend 
one whole year in this way before attending a college or 
technical school. 
Preparation for one’s life work is not limited to the 
mastering of certain subjects nor to the acquiring of cer- 
tain skill or ability. (Real success in any vocation is founded 
upon character, ) All the training of technical schools and 
universities will not make a dishonest man truly successful 
in life.) It will not give him executive ability if he lacks 
human interest or social efficiency, or has never learned 
self-control.) Therefore, the ambitious youth will endeavor 
to perfect his character and to develop the qualities de- 
manded by his vocation, just as earnestly as he strives 
to master the technique of the trade or profession. 
A young man about twenty-three years of age came to 
my office for vocational advice. He was married and had 
one child. For eight years he had shoveled coal, receiving 
as a maximum but eleven dollars a week. Sickness in the 
home and an accident which kept him from work for 
several weeks had forced him into hopeless debt.. His 
vocational analysis indicated very clearly that the one am- 
bition of his life and his most favorable outlook was to 
be a stationary engineer. Accordingly, a position as fire- 
man with a good engineer was found for him at a better 
wage and shorter hours. pee of study in stationary 
engineering was provided for him and He was given every 
encouragement to go ahead and lift himself out of his for- 
mer desperate condition. All went well for a few months 
until his uncontrolled temper and his lack of ability to 
[87] 
   
-P-A-G-E-96
  VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
work harmoniously with others finally lost him his place, 
and back he went to the coal yards. This is one of the 
discouraging experiences of the vocational counselor, but 
it well illustrates the point that vocational and moral guid- 
ance are inseparable, and that the formation of right habits 
and the development of moral qualities are a necessary 
part of one’s preparation for a successful career, 
The fundamental elements of character that make for 
success in any career have been discussed in the chapter 
under that title. The present discussion of character is 
intended to draw out two phases of the subject : first, the 
special qualities that are demanded by the particular voca- 
tion chosen; and second, the moral problems that are 
peculiar to the vocation itself. 
In looking forward to any given vocation the aspirant 
should compare his own character analysis with the moral 
requisites of the vocation, in order that he may begin to 
practice those qualities in which he finds himself lacking. 
The young man expecting to be a salesman must develop 
tact and diplomacy in approaching and presenting his com- 
modity to his customers; he must be worthy of the con- 
fidence of both his employer and his clients ; he must be 
attractive in appearance and personality so that he may win 
friends and business; he must love his work and prove 
by his interest and loyalty that he has a spirit of genuine 
service. (be young woman hoping to be a successful 
teacher must have a deep love for children, a character 
that is above the criticism of the public and that will be 
an example to her pupils ; she must have health, patience, 
tact, humor, a keen sense of justice, and an abundance 
of good nature; she must be willing to enter upon her

   mission in life with a full realization of the great responsi- 
bility of her moral influence in the lives of her pupils. 
In this manner each profession, trade, or line of busi- 
ness may be analyzed to the advantage of the pupil. Inter- 
views with men and women in the vocation investigated 
will be of help in determining the special qualities sought. 
Observation of those at work in certain vocations and the 
opinions of those who employ or are in charge of them will 
also draw out the peculiar virtues that are required and the 
failings that must be avoided. It will be found that there 
are certain defects of character that will hinder one in some 
vocations more than in others, and while it is undoubtedly 
better to study the virtues than the defects, it may not be 
amiss to point them out as something to be overcome. 
The second phase of the relationship between character 
and vocation may be termed business ethics. Every pro- 
fession, every form of business, and every line of industry 
has its moral problems that are more or less peculiar to 
itself or to its class. The doctor accepts the doctrines of 
his profession and maintains its practice as he holds his 
honor. The lawyer keeps the secrets of his clients as a 
sacred trust. We often hear the expressions “‘ professional 
honor,” “ professional courtesy,” and ‘‘ professional code,” 
referring to the customs in certain professions which have 
become the moral obligations that must be assumed by 
those who enter the professions in good faith. 
Modern business methods is the most discussed topic 
of the day. No young man or woman is ready to enter 
the employ of a large business or corporation until he has 
looked into some of the questions which will confront him 
sooner or later. Certain customs and practices have grown 
[89]
-P-A-G-E-98
VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
through combination and organization into a powerful sys- 
tem that has come to be both unjust and corrupt in its 
dealings. The young and self-confident aspirant may find 
it hard to maintain his own standard of honor, and exceed- 
ingly difficult to start out single-handed to work a reform 
in the system. Many a young man, who has looked for- 
ward with pleasant anticipation to a certain business, has 
found, after he has entered upon it, that he was called. 
upon to do certain things that were not only repulsive 
to his nature but also against his best sense of justice 
and honor. Those who have had the moral courage to 
fight it out or even to get away from such a situation have 
won a commendable victory. The history of business suc- 
cesses is filled with the records of men who have stood 
the test of honor and who have won the satisfaction of 
successful achievement, at the same time keeping the 
freedom of conscience so essential to true happiness. 
No problems so vitally affect the foundations of society 
as those arising from the conditions of modern industry. 
The strife between capital and labor will never be settled 
until men have the conviction and the courage to apply 
the great moral law called the golden rule to the adminis- 
tration of industry. The solution of these problems is not 
alone one of training skilled workmen, nor of securing effi- 
ciency in administration ; it is just as truly one that con- 
cerns human relationships and moral conduct. 
While these questions are serious ones and need the 
most careful handling, their discussion cannot help being 
profitable. It is desirable that most students take on a 
more serious view of life in order that they may be im- 
pressed with their own moral responsibility. However, the 
[90 ] 
 
-P-A-G-E-99
  
PREPARATION FOR ONE’S LIFE WORK 
outlook upon life should not be darkened by dwelling too 
long upon the evil conditions of society. The great things 
yet to be done should be held out to inspire each boy’s 
and girl’s ambition to overcome the obstacles that may 
impede human progress and to have a share in the solution 
of some of these great problems.

CHAPTER X 
SOCIAL AND CIVIC ETHICS FROM THE POINT 
OF VIEW OF THE CHOSEN VOCATION 
To live is not to live 
For one’s self alone. — MENANDER 
“ Each for All.” 
Active interest in the general welfare of human society 
is characteristic of strictly modern times. The early his- 
tory of the race was self-centered: social interest was 
limited by barriers of blood or caste, and even religious 
thought was dominated by self motives. From these con- 
ditions people are loath to depart. Historic ideals — the 
traditions and customs of former generations —are held 
to most tenaciously ; religious dogmas continue especially 
powerful in dominating the actions of men. But in spite 
of all, the old order is swiftly passing away before the 
more altruistic spirit of a modern age. With the growth 
of civilization men have become more and more dependent 
upon one another. Forced by the conditions which sur- 
rounded them to be interdependent in all their relations, 
men have learned the meaning of the “brotherhood of 
man.” A new vision of the spirit of Christianity has 
opened men’s eyes and aroused their sympathies ; it has 
impressed them with their responsibility for others, and 
has stirred them to actions in behalf of human society as 
never before in the history of the world. 
[99]

  VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
To-day men and women are banded together in a mul- 
titude of organizations to promote the social welfare of 
those less fortunate than themselves. These associations 
are both local and national in scope and have been instru- 
mental in bringing about great reform in many fields. 
Better housing conditions for the poor, purer foods and 
drugs, cleaner and more wholesome means of entertain- 
ment and recreation, and better conditions of labor for 
women and children, are among the results of this grow- 
ing human interest. Evidence of the same spirit is found 
in the modern church, which is so active in applying the 
teachings of Christ to the everyday problems of life. 
The public schools, too, are making every effort to serve 
the masses rather than the favored few. Courses of in- 
struction are planned to meet the needs of every one, old 
or young, and school buildings are being thrown open for 
social purposes. Our cities, awakened from a period of | 
indifference toward corruption to one of political reform, 
have at the same time gone far into the realm of social 
uplift. We are living in a day when each individual who 
would take his place in the world as a successful man in 
his vocation and as a ‘‘man among men” must take his 
part in sharing the burden of society. 
The man who attempts to disregard his social obliga- 
tions pays the penalty in one way or another. Whatever 
the evil conditions may be that are permitted to exist in 
any community, they reflect the social interest of the 
majority in that community. This is true of the neigh- 
borhood, the city, the state, and the nation. The results 
of these permitted evils strike back at society, demanding 
vast sums of money for prisons, asylums, courts, hospitals, 
[ 100 ] ;  
-P-A-G-E-109
SOCIAL AND CIVIC ETHICS 
special homes and schools, sums that might be saved if 
the causes that demand these institutions were removed. 
But this is not the greatest tax upon society, The annual 
tribute of young men and maidens from our homes exacted 
by the Minotaur of modern vice is a penalty too great to 
be longer tolerated. As Theseus of old went forth to slay 
this monster, so men are called upon to-day to step out 
from lives of selfish interest and, in whatever vocation 
they find themselves, to use their position and influence 
for the uplift of their fellow men. : 
Each vocation has its own peculiar social obligations, 
and often it has exceptional opportunities for human serv- 
ice. The so-called learned professions are dependent upon 
society for their practice and have a distinct social mission. 
While many an individual falls short of the ideal in his 
profession, there are more who have struggled to maintain 
the high purpose of their calling. Society owes much to 
lawyers who have given of their knowledge to the cause 
of human justice; to physicians who have devoted their 
lives to scientific investigation, even giving themselves in 
sacrifice that men might be freed from pestilence and 
disease ; to scientists, poets, musicians, artists, teachers, 
and preachers, who have opened men’s eyes to a greater 
and more beautiful world in which to live. The engineer 
who plans and constructs great railways, builds steamships, 
or tunnels the mountains in the advance of transportation, 
is performing a great benefaction to society. The manu- 
facturer and the inventor who makes human labor lighter 
and produces more abundantly the necessities and com- 
forts of life is contributing his share in the general uplift 
of humanity. The business man who deals on the square 
[ ror ]
-P-A-G-E-110
  VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
with his customers and brings to them the products of 
the world is helping to establish happier homes. Yes, the 
tradesman and the toiler, however humble their labor may 
be, are each contributing to the general welfare. Every 
man who is not a misfit in his occupation, but who feels 
that in and through his vocation he is giving his own best 
service to humanity, is truly called to his work and is 
fulfilling his mission in life. 
And everybody’s reaping is determined, both in quantity 
and in kind, by his sowing. Nemesis stands ready to even 
up things in the world. It is said that each one gets just 
about what he deserves — that is, each obtains out of life © 
what he puts into it. The man who is selfish and grasping 
may accumulate a great fortune, but the real reward for 
his greed is the resultant hatred of his fellow men. A rich 
man’s place in the world, his influence, the honor, respect, 
and affection bestowed upon him, in fact, all that goes to 
make up his real soul’s satisfaction, depends upon the 
extent to which he has given of himself to others. 
Most men need some interest outside of their vocations 
to keep themselves in proper social balance. To take 
active part in some phase of social service as a side issue 
often proves a most satisfying source of pleasure to the 
busy man of affairs. He owes it to himself as well as to 
society to ally himself actively with some organization, be 
it church, social settlement, or society to promote social 
or civic reform. 
All these truths should be impressed upon the student. 
If he is looking forward to establishing himself in a cer- 
tain vocation, and has made his choice with the proper 
motive, he should be planning to enter that calling because 
[ 102 ] 
 
-P-A-G-E-111
  
SOCIAL AND CIVIC ETHICS 
it affords him his best opportunity for service. Therefore, 
it is of importance that he should make a special study of 
the vocation with respect to its social obligations, its pe- 
culiar opportunities for human service, and the responsi- 
bilities which a successful career would bring to him as 
an influential citizen in the community. It is essential 
that during the last year of a student’s high-school experi- 
ence his attention should be directed along sociological 
lines from the viewpoint of his chosen vocation. His in- 
terest may be aroused by making some investigations of 
local conditions and reporting upon such matters as hous- 
ing conditions, the conduct of public charities, the work 
of the social settlements, the Salvation Army, the Volun- 
teers of America, the Young Men’s and Women’s Chris- 
tian Associations, the social activities of some church, etc. 
Each locality, rural or urban, will show either work being 
done or the need of some phase of social endeavor. Some 
pupils may be led to begin some form of service, and all 
will gain a broader vision of human responsibility through 
looking forward to the greater opportunities for service 
that may be theirs through the peculiar advantage of their 
chosen vocation. 
For the second semester of the senior year the problems 
of civic ethics are most appropriate. It has been said of 
the American democracy that its greatest danger lies in 
the criminal indifference of its intelligent citizenship. 
Corrupt practices in municipal affairs, wasteful methods 
of administration, the prostitution of high office for private 
gain, exist because our “best citizens’ do not care enough 
for the honor of their city, their state, or their nation to 
take the necessary time from their vocations to “live for 
[ 103 ]
-P-A-G-E-112
  VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
their country.” In the hope of educating better citizens, 
schools attempt to enforce the study of civics upon all 
pupils before they are graduated from the high school. 
In very few large high schools is this possible ; but when 
topics concerning civic righteousness are made a part of 
the work in English, which all pupils must take, they are 
getting the desired training in citizenship, and getting it 
from a more concrete and personal point of view than in 
the usual formal study of civics. 
The recent political awakening that is breaking down 
the old party lines in local government; that is changing 
the very form of municipal administration to free it from 
corruption ; that is demanding a higher standard of effi- 
ciency in public office, is evidence of the fact that the 
American citizen, while apparently indifferent and often 
negligent of his public duty, can be aroused to action. 
We are living in an era of great political change. Young 
men and young women about to leave the high school, 
the majority of whom will enter immediately upon their 
life work, must not only be impressed with their civic 
duty, but must be instructed in the actual part that they 
will be expected to play as busy men and women and 
loyal citizens. 
The charge that Americans are worshiping the Almighty 
Dollar and that for this reason they are indifferent to civic 
responsibility may have foundation in fact. However, 
those men who have devoted their lives to the accumula- . 
tion of wealth at such a sacrifice of honor are not men 
who have entered upon their vocations from a right motive 
or in accordance with our definition of a vocation. They 
have not entered upon their life work or occupation 
[ 104 ]
-P-A-G-E-113
  
SOCIAL AND CIVIC ETHICS 
because it was the best means by which they, with their 
ability, might serve their fellow men. Those who do ac- 
cept this definition will recognize their opportunities for 
performing civic duties as a part of their calling. This 
means that the merchant who sells his goods at a fair 
profit and satisfies the material demands of the commu- 
nity has not done his full duty. It means that the com- 
munity’s demand for justice, for schools, for efficient 
public service, for protection from theft, fire, and pesti- 
lence, is also a part of his responsibility. If he is not 
altogether blinded by selfishness, he will see that a well- 
governed community is the desirable place in which to 
transact his business, and in which to live and bring up 
his family. 
Each loyal citizen should be able to find some special 
opportunity for patriotic service through his vocation. 
The lawyer can apply his knowledge and experience to 
the legal or legislative problems of government. The 
physician can give of his wisdom and skill to improve 
the health and sanitary conditions of the community. 
The preacher and the teacher can educate the public 
and the rising generation to appreciate the responsibilities 
of citizenship. The successful business man can apply his 
experience and shrewdness to a more economic adminis- 
tration of public affairs. And so the engineer, the con- 
tractor, the mechanic, and the laborer, — each and all may 
contribute to a better-built, a better-paved, a better-lighted, 
and a better-watered city. 
These suggestions are made hoping that the public 
schools, in attempting to satisfy the demand for the 
“ practical’ in education, will not neglect their own civic 
[ 105 ] 
 
-P-A-G-E-114
    vOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
responsibility nor merely perform it perfunctorily. Civic 
problems are vital. The skeleton of governmental form 
must be clothed with flesh and blood. Each pupil must 
be so impressed that he will go out from the school with 
his dominating aim in life, not to be merely a successful 
lawyer, engineer, or business man, but to be in and through 
his vocation a true patriot, ready to live a life of service 
devoted to the general uplift of humanity in his city, his 
country, and the world.

CHAPTER XI 
THE VOCATIONALIZED CURRICULUM 
The teacher who should be sufficiently broad-minded and diplo- 
matic to harmonize opposing tendencies in education, would be the 
greatest peacemaker in the world. — CHARLES A. McMurRAY 
Every field of human thought and endeavor is under- 
going changes that are fundamentally significant and strik- 
ingly similar. Men are awaking to the fact that they are 
not of necessity bound to the ideas and methods of ages 
long since past. The needs of the present are So radically 
different that men are compelled to face new problems and 
to look forward rather than backward for their solution. 
The shackles of tradition in religion, in politics, in business, 
in industry, and in education are being strained to the 
breaking point. In the midst of all this controversy con- 
structive leaders are striving to hold to the best of the past, 
and at the same time to adjust their ideas to meet the 
present situation. It is only by this conservative method 
that progress will be made and that the threatening revo- 
lutions may be met without disrupting our long-established 
institutions. 
» i During the past decade or more the demand for the so- 
called ‘‘ practical” in education has swept over the country 
with a force that could not be resisted. In spite of the 
efforts of the most strictly orthodox pedagogues, new sub- 
jects have entered the already crowded curricula of both 
[112]
-P-A-G-E-121
THE VOCATIONALIZED CURRICULUM 
secondary schools and universities, Commercial schools, 
technical schools, trade schools, and continuation schools 
have entered the field of secondary education. The cos- 
mopolitan high schools of the West are attempting to 
supply all of these needs under one roof and under one 
administration. The higher institutions are called upon 
in no feeble manner to recognize these newer branches as 
of equal educational value with the old and as equivalent 
preparation for entrance to college. 
Before the contention can be settled satisfactorily, the | 
rivalry between the devotees of subjects, new or old, must 
be set aside, and the welfare of the pupil must be made 
the basis of agreement. For the sake of the boy or girl 
who is preparing for efficient living, proper standards of 
education must be determined. As time goes on, with the 
forces pulling in different directions, the resultant path of 
educational progress will show that the “ practical’ sub- 
jects have come to stay but that they must be raised to 
an academic standard of efficiency, and that the academic 
subjects must become more “ practical” in their applica- 
tion. The academic curriculum is already. undergoing some 
startling transformations, evidences of which are apparent 
in every meeting of educators, and in'the newer textbooks. 
Live teachers are experimenting in their several fields and 
eagerly grasping suggestions for progressive work. 
Among the first of the academic branches to respond 
to this demand was science. Being the youngest of the 
group, it was possibly less bound by tradition and was 
nearer to. the practical issues of life. Physical geography 
began as elementary geology and is now better described 
as commercial physiography. Botany deals far less with

VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
microscopic and prehistoric forms of plant life and extends 
out into the fields of agriculture and horticulture. Zodlogy, 
in the same way, has more to do with the insect and animal 
life that is of importance to the welfare of man. Physi- 
ology is no longer a study of anatomy, but of practical 
hygiene. Chemistry is differentiating into domestic chem- 
istry for girls and industrial chemistry for boys. And 
physics, always popular because of its practical applications, 
has kept up to date with wireless telegraphy, aeronautics, 
and shop mechanics. 
For some years an effort has been made among teachers 
of mathematics to respond to the same call. Recent writers 
of texts are eliminating much of the theory of former books 
and are introducing more of what may be called applied 
mathematics. The attempt to correlate the work in mathe- 
matics with mechanical drawing, shop work, and science 
is bound to give new life and human interest to a subject 
that has been used too long, for the majority of pupils, as 
a mere form of mental gymnastics. The training of the 
mind in logic has its place in the curriculum ; but, if the 
same disciplinary value can be retained in any subject and 
to it be added a practical value, by application of the work 
to modern life, the educational value of the subject will be 
increased accordingly. 
History is another subject which has buried itself too 
deeply in the distant past. Possibly this is the natural 
tendency of the subject itself. However, the present era 
demands that the best of past ages contribute to the wel- 
fare of the present and the future. We have given too 
much time in secondary schools to the study of ancient 
and medieval periods, in comparison with the time given 
[114]
-P-A-G-E-123
THE VOCATIONALIZED CURRICULUM 
the modern centuries, whose developments have laid the 
foundations of the world conditions of to-day. Textbooks of 
modern history do not relate the events that really make up 
the fundamental development of the human race. Writers 
cannot record the growth of a democratic age in the terms 
of an aristocratic past. Mere “political”? annals do not 
describe the real history of an industrial and commercial 
people. 
Without waiting for new texts in history the progressive 
teacher can do much for the subject by making use of the 
vocational aim of the pupils. The varied outlook of the 
individuals in the class will introduce many streams of 
living interest into a course of history. Opportunity should 
be given to each pupil to make a special study of the occu- 
pation or art in which he has a vital interest, and to keep 
a notebook outline of its development during the period 
being studied. The boy who is expecting to be an architect 
can, as his particular duty, trace the development of the 
orders of architecture and their style of construction with 
their historical background. .The future lawyer has an in- 
terest in the origin and growth of court procedure, legal 
customs, and legislation ; the doctor, in the beginnings of 
alchemy, chemistry, and healing ; the manufacturer, in the . 
early factory systems, labor organizations, and the inven- 
tion of machinery; the business man, in the history of 
transportation ; the journalist, in the invention and uses of 
printing ; and so on indefinitely, not to overlook the future 
home maker, who should appreciate the development of 
the modern home and the place of woman in society. Any 
class that approaches a given period in history from these 
varied avenues gains a broader and deeper insight into the 
[115]   
 
-P-A-G-E-124
  VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
value of history, and at the same time each pupil has made 
a concrete and personal application of the subject that 
will throw new light upon the history-making events of the 
present day. 
The study of foreign languages, that at one time formed 
the largest factor in cultural education, is still fundamental 
to higher education. The so-called ‘‘ dead”’ languages are 
not in reality dead. We have been for so long a time ad- ) 
dicted to the college-entrance-examination habit that we ; 
have almost forgotten the real place that Latin and Greek 
actually play in our everyday life. Our own language, as 
we use it in every field of technical terminology, as we use | 
it in interpreting the exact meaning of verbal expression, 
and as we use it in the real satisfaction that comes from 
an understanding love of literature, is dependent to-day 
upon the proper application of the study of language. 
The teaching of modern languages is no exception to the 
reformation. Well-educated European youths can converse | 
in several tongues, but it would be difficult to find one | 
among them who could pass an American high-school 
examination in his native language. Any subject in the 
curriculum whose use stops when college-entrance require- 
ments are met, is already dead. The present era demands 
of every subject an additional and more practical raison 
@ ttre. 
As for English, one purpose in preparing this manual 
was to suggest to teachers of that subject a plan for mak- 
ing the work in composition approach the newer ideal in 
education. It is fundamentally important that the pupil be 
aided in applying his ambition and hopes of future success 
to the daily tasks of the present. No subject lends itself 
[ 116]   
 
-P-A-G-E-125
¥ 
THE VOCATIONALIZED CURRICULUM 
better to the purpose of vocational guidance than English. 
To accomplish this purpose, some changes must un- 
doubtedly take place in the range of the literature studied ; 
the critical analysis of certain masterpieces must be re- 
turned to the college, where they belong, and more atten- 
tion must be given to the analysis of writings dealing with 
the more vital problems of modern civilization. 
This vision of the academic curriculum is not a dream 
nor is it entirely prophetic. Enough of it is now in actual 
practice to make it all come true. In time the principles 
of business efficiency will be applied to the educational 
system. We shall know the standards of ability that are 
demanded by the average successful man in a given voca- 
tion, and shall establish similar standards of measurement 
in school that will apply to the various subjects taught. 
Thus we shall be able to test the efficiency of both pupil 
and teacher, and to supply more accurately the kind of 
training and the information necessary to prepare a pupil 
not only for a certain vocation but for a fuller appreciation 
of the civilization of his own age. 
When this Utopian vision is realized, vocational guid- 
ance will mean a more scientific direction in the selection 
of subjects from the curriculum. Each pupil, under skilled 
advisers, will select the studies that will give him the train- 
ing and the information which will be of greatest benefit 
to him in his future career. Every subject will face this 
crucial test. Its selection must be made with mind free 
from biased opinion, tradition, or collegiate domination, 
holding to the one purpose of directing the pupil toward 
that which will prove to be best for hin he voca- 
tional aim, using the term in its broadest interpretation, 
[117] 
 
-P-A-G-E-126
VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
will prove to be the final influence that will lift the 
“practical” subjects up to the academic standard, and 
will also point the way for a more practical presentation 
of the academic branches. Thus will have been brought 
about a revolution without disruption.

CHAPTER XII 
TRAINING FOR SOCIAL EFFICIENCY AS A 
VOCATIONAL ASSET Ree 
Responsibility is the best developing force, and development is ) 
the end of all education. — S. C. ARMSTRONG } 
im (to be a leader in one’s vocation a man must be socially 
e vient.) In this age of codperation, of combination, and 
of systematic organization, practically every occupation 
among men has its association for the purpose of pro- 
moting the vocational interests of its members. These 
societies need the direction of wise and competent leaders.) 
he management of great business enterprises, too, is 
demanding a large number of men who are not only 
skilled and well informed regarding the business but also 
able to handle men. In fact, wherever we look in our 
present complex life we see the need of efficient leaders. 
The public schools havemeglected the development of 
people to meet this need. (in time past every effort was 
made by school authorities to suppress the social instincts 
of the pupils, in the blind belief that the schools existed 
for the instruction of the intellect alone) Social impulses 
broke out in forms of outlawry, brifging faculty and 
students into open warfare. Secret organizations gradually 
became the dominating influence in the social life of the 
students. Teachers quite generally condemned and are 
[119]
-P-A-G-E-128
  VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
still condemning these societies, but have, for the most 
part, shown themselves quite unwilling to undertake a 
proper solution of the perplexing problem. They have 
declared war, but the majority of school authorities have 
as yet met with only partial victory. 
The school men who have been most successful in 
solving the fraternity problem have recognized the value 
of student activities as means of social development. By 
gradually substituting more legitimate societies for the 
old, and by directing the efforts of the students toward 
higher aims and more efficient work, a new field of educa- 
tional possibility has been opened up. Many experiments 
are being tried in progressive high schools throughout the 
country. The pupils who show powers of initiative, quali- 
ties of leadership, and executive ability are encouraged 
and given opportunity to develop these characteristics 
through the various forms of student organizations and 
enterprises. 
In every large high school, with its many interests and 
increasing number-of social activities, there is wide 
opportunity for demonstrating the value of system, of 
coéperation, and of combination of effort. Just as the 
large factory, department store, or wholesale business is 
organized with its general manager, heads of departments, 
superintendents or foremen, so the school can unite all of 
the student interests into a complete system of educational 
value to the entire body. The diagram on page 121 will 
serve to illustrate such a scheme. 
In this plan the principal is the general manager and 
by virtue of his office is a member of each advisory board. 
As each society must be under the direction of such a 
[ 120 ]

board, it gives him a position of oversight and control. 
The advisory boards, made up of two members of the 
faculty and two or more students with the principal an 
ex-officio member, are more than boards of control or

because of their ability or interest in the special activity 
represented. They are in the work of the society to give 
of their experience and wisdom and to lead the members 
in planning and executing their undertakings.

  VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
The faculty members of all of the various organizations 
may be brought together by the principal as an advisory 
council to consider the social welfare of the entire school, 
and to assist the principal in shaping the general social 
policy. Certain matters relating to the student life and 
initiated by students may be referred to this group for ratifi- 
cation or approval. Such a council, composed of those 
teachers who are close to the lives of the students in all 
of their social activities, cannot help being of great assist- 
ance to the principal as well as being of great influence 
in the work of the organizations. 
The pupils who are members of the advisory boards of 
the various clubs — usually the presidents and secretaries 
—may be brought together as a student council. If the 
school is fully organized, such a council will represent all 
of the pupils, and will serve the purpose of a certain form 
of student self-government. The principal will find this 
body of leaders a most powerful factor in bringing about 
needed reforms in the student life. It will lend itself 
most willingly to the promotion of plans to secure needed 
improvements for the school, of certain school functions, 
celebrations, or campaigns. In the hands of the sympa- 
thetic and tactful principal who studies the needs of the 
local situation, it will determine the very spirit and 
atmosphere of the school. 
The boys and the girls who are members of this council 
may be separated into two groups, to form the nucleus of 
what may be called Leaders’ clubs. The principal can 
direct the work of the Boys’ Leaders’ Club, and the precep- 
tress of the Girls’ Leaders’ Club. The first purpose of these 
clubs should be to study the fundamental principles of 
[ 122 ]
-P-A-G-E-131
  TRAINING FOR SOCIAL EFFICIENCY 
efficient leadership. With meetings once in two weeks, a 
splendid course of instruction can be planned and executed 
«by the students themselves under the direction of the prin- 
cipal. These leaders in the student life will soon determine 
the social and moral standards of the student body. They 
can take up the more serious problems of a social character 
for consideration ; they can investigate actual conditions 
more thoroughly than can the faculty ; and their influence 
in bringing about reform will prove most effectual. 
In order that the best interests of the pupils may be 
served and an equal opportunity be given to all, certain 
general rules and regulations should be adopted. There 
is always a tendency upon the part of some to join 
everything that they can and thus overdo the social part 
of their training. If this is permitted, it will necessarily 
crowd out some of the less aggressive ones who are more 
in need of social development. To avoid this it might 
prove best to rule that no pupil can belong to more than 
one organization of the same type at the same time. And 
for similar reasons no pupil should be allowed to hold 
office in more than one organization at the same time. 
he of the most practical lessons to be learned through 
the*social life of the school is how to enter into the spirit 
and work of these activities and not to neglect one’s 
regular school work. ! Every successful citizen, who is 
active in the social, religious, and civic welfare of his 
community, must learn how to give of his time, energy, 
and thought to these interests, and at the same time not 
to neglect his business or his profession.) The same 
principle applies to participation in school activities. The 
notorious failure of athletes to keep up their studies has 
[123]
-P-A-G-E-132
  VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
made it necessary to establish a certain standard of scholar- 
ship to be attained by those students who are permitted to 
enter athletic contests between schools. When properly 
enforced this rule, demanding the passing of at least three 
full academic studies during the two previous semesters 
and the maintenance of a passing mark in the same 
amount of work from the beginning of the semester until 
the time of the contest, has raised the standard of athletics 
ymost effectively. From this experience, it seems wise that 
' this rule or a similar one should be applied to all students 
who are candidates for office in any school organization 
or who may be chosen to represent the school in any 
academic contest. 
For the enforcement of the fules just suggested, some 
grouping or classification of the activities to be found in 
a school should be made. This will vary with the local 
situation and must be worked out by the interested par- 
ties. In general, most activities, as suggested in the 
chart, can be classified under the headings of academic, 
art, athletic, social, and general. Whatever the detailed 
plan may be, the purpose to be kept in mind is that each 
student ‘should be given an equal opportunity to obtain 
the benefits to be gained through social activities, and 
that he should be so guided and guarded that his best 
general interests will not be injured. 
The entire plan implies that every student who gets 
the training to be obtained in leading his fellows in some 
school organization is preparing himself for similar oppor- 
tunities in leading his fellow workers in his future voca- 
tion. The history of many a successful man and woman 
will prove the truth of this statement. From my personal 
[124]
-P-A-G-E-133
  TRAINING FOR SOCIAL EFFICIENCY 
acquaintance I can name a number of prominent news- 
paper men who have testified that they found themselves, 
and so obtained their most valuable start in life, as editors 
of their high-school paper. I can also name several men 
who are at the head of large and prosperous manufactur- 
ing plants who assert that they began their present careers 
when they were business managers of the school paper or 
of the school athletic association. The results of this train- 
ing may not always be so direct in its application, but the 
training received is never lost. My experience as a voca- 
tional director has shown that the young men who have 
been prominent in the social life of the school are by far 
the most desirable when it comes to placing pupils in good 
positions. They know how to talk, how to approach men ; 
they make a better impression in applying for a position ; 
they know how to attack their work in codperation with 
other employees; they have learned many things not 
found i in books, but possibly of equal value. 
fhe vocational aim can be made the direct purpose of 
some societies, by grouping those students who are look- 
ing forward to the same occupation. Such a group can 
study its own vocation with the assistance of the best 
magazines devoted to its interests and of prominent 
men who can speak from experience. This scheme will 
give each member a better insight into the real nature 
of his proposed vocation than he could get by any other 
means while in school. The positive results of a voca- 
tional club can hardly be estimated, but if the student 
finds in this way that the vocation studied is not the 
one that he is fitted for, the club will have served a most 
worthy end. 
125]
-P-A-G-E-134
VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
wv ocational clubs are practical for those who have some 
idea of the vocation they wish to enter, but a different 
organization is needed for those who are as yet unable to 
come to any decision in the matter.) An account of one 
such organization may prove suggestive to those interested 
in the problem. 
The education committee of the Association of Com- 
merce of Grand Rapids, Michigan, began a movement in 
1910 to interest the sons of members in the industrial and 
commercial institutions of that city. A junior association 
was formed, and it has had a continuous and successful 
growth since its beginning. At its meetings, held in the 
auditorium of the senior association on alternate Saturday 
mornings, a brief vocational address is given by the best 
speaker to be obtained locally in that occupation. The 
boys take part in a lively discussion, asking pertinent ques- 
tions about the desirability of the vocation, the qualities 
necessary for success, the best methods of preparing for 
and entering the vocation, and many other things that 
only earnest seekers for light will think of. This hour of 
discussion is usually followed by a trip to the factory or 
place of business represented by the speaker. By this 
means many of the boys have found the occupation that 
has most appealed to them, and have obtained positions 
during vacations or on Saturdays to try themselves out in 
actual employment. 
This organization has also a civic value. To have the 
privilege of attending a great mass meeting or banquet 
with the senior association held for the promotion of some 
civic improvement or reform; to assist in a general cam- 
paign to secure needed legislation for the betterment of 
[126]
-P-A-G-E-135
TRAINING FOR SOCIAL EFFICIENCY 
the city ; to help in making a survey of some local condi- 
tion — such opportunities exert a powerful influence in 
the lives of these future citizens. 
Aside from the training that supervised club life gives 
in school, there are many other ways in which the activities 
of the students may be given a sort of vocational or prac- 
tical atmosphere. The weekly assembly of the school lends 
itself to this purpose. Here is an opportunity to train 
pupils in presiding over large numbers. Some may gain 
valuable experience in making announcements, in intro- 
ducing prominent speakers, in leading a musical organiza- 
tion, in directing the school in a song or in the school 
yell. Once in a while an invited speaker can give a voca- 
tional address of a general nature, and so carry out the 
idea of using every means to keep right ideals and pur- 
poses before the pupils. 
Other chapters in this book have emphasized the value 
of moral training as a preparation for a successful career. 
There is no better opportunity for applying lessons in 
moral ethics than through the administration and work of 
organized student activities. The most notable illustration 
of this statement is seen in the reformation that has taken 
place in the conduct of athletics in all of our educational 
institutions. In games every moral quality is put to the 
test. Lessons in codperation, obedience, tact, right think- 
ing and prompt action, initiative and leadership, are learned 
most effectively. But a few years ago when athletic inter- 
ests were neglected by the school authorities, the corrupt- 
ing influences were very bad from every point of view. 
To-day under faculty management, faculty coaching, and 
state-wide rules supported by upright principals, athletics 
[127] 
   
-P-A-G-E-136
VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
can be made a potent factor in developing the moral qual- 
ities of character so essential to business success. 
If one takes up a list of the qualities necessary for suc- 
cess in any given vocation as suggested by many of the 
books dealing with vocational guidance, and then turns to 
the public schools to see where and how these qualities are 
being developed, he will find that an effort — more or less 
satisfactory according to his point of view — is being made 
by every teacher to build up these essentials of character. 
We aim to impress our pupils with the necessity of being 
prompt, of acting according to certain rules of conduct, 
of being upright and honest, etc. However, we must 
admit that in many instances we fail to accomplish our 
purpose because the pupil is placed in an entirely wrong 
attitude toward all of our efforts. To avoid the rules, to 
““put one over” on the teacher is smart, and “all is fair 
in war.” Our platitudes and preachments have become 
commonplace. But the pupils’ own “rules of the game” 
are law and must be enforced. The rules of the society 
are self-made, and if the organization succeeds in its pur- 
pose the rules must be obeyed. The average student cares 
more for the good will and approbation of his fellows than 
he does for that of either teachers or parents. The stand- 
ards of the “gang” are most exacting, whatever their 
level may be. Therefore it is of importance that we as edu- 
cators recognize our past failures, and show ourselves will- 
ing to make use of the wonderful opportunities offered by 
the social activities that have forced themselves upon us 
and that are demanding our guidance.

  CHAPTER XIII 
A WORD TO PARENTS 
Who can declare for what high cause 
This darling of the gods was born? 
Every mother’s son and every father’s daughter is a 
“darling of the gods.’ Each fond parent looks upon its 
own little helpless babe in arms and dreams dreams of its 
future happiness, and prays prayers for its future success 
in the world into which it has been born. Loving grand- 
parents, doting aunties, and meddlesome relatives soon 
begin to predict the future career, and sometimes even 
bring to bear such influence as to determine the calling 
into which the youth must go, whether it be to success or 
defeat. To be ambitious for our children is a most natural 
and human instinct, but to force upon the child our own 
preconceived ideals of what constitutes a noble or worthy 
calling, without taking into careful consideration the child 
itself, — his or her ability, aptitude, or gifts, — is unreason- 
able. Our dreams of high offices, learned professions, and 
paths of fame are none too good for our babes in arms, 
‘but the difficulty is with our own imperfect ideals of honor, 
glory, and success. Custom and tradition have led many 
a loving parent to force a boy into a life of defeat as a 
lawyer when he might have been a happy and successful 
farmer. Many a struggling doctor might to-day be a con- 
tented and prosperous merchant if certain false ideals had 
[ 130] 
 
-P-A-G-E-139
A WORD TO PARENTS 
not been forced upon him. Some day the dignity of labor 
will be so manifest in our education and in our civilization 
that devoted parents will realize that the only dream of joy 
for their growing son is to picture him in that field of 
labor in which he can put forth his best effort to serve his 
fellow men. Ww. e should pray that our boys and our girls 
may find happiness and success through living the life 
that brings, not the greatest pride and vanity to us, but 
the greatest contentment and soul satisfaction to ye 
On the other hand, there are many parents, and’ the 
number seems to be increasing, who are wholly indifferent 
as to the future careers of their children. Some, too busy 
to give their children much time or attention, place the 
whole responsibility upon the public schools. Some have 
such faith in our educational system that they actually 
believe that a diploma certifying to graduation from a high 
school is a guarantee of success. It matters little what the 
children studied or how they obtained the credit, so long 
as they receive the label and are checked through to 
S success.!’ 
Another great mistake regarding the obtaining of an 
education is made by parents who insist upon keeping a 
boy over sixteen years of age at a course of study, or 
upon certain studies, or in a certain kind of school, when 
he has proved beyond any question or doubt that he is 
absolutely unadapted to that kind of study. Invariably such 
a boy is learning evil habits of living, thinking, and acting. 
At the very moment that it is proved that he is in the 
wrong path, he should be placed where he can make some 
headway. Constant defeat is deadening. Nothing succeeds 
or encourages like success. Such a boy might far better 
[131 } 
    
 
-P-A-G-E-140
    VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
be placed in some good business or industry where he can 
learn right habits of thought and action and can have 
some chance for success, rather than be held in school 
under the false idea that by so doing he is “ getting an 
education.” 
/ In most countries of Europe the boy has less chance to 
waste his time, and, as he leaves the grammar school, he 
must enter directly upon a course of training that is to 
determine his vocation. More has been done in those 
countries than in America to train skilled workmen for the 
industries. Boys must attend school longer and they must 
prepare for some special field of labor. 
In this country the system of apprenticeship used to 
serve, to some extent, the same purpose, but now this 
system has practically disappeared. In the attempt to give 
the desired training for the boys and girls and to meet the 
demands of business and industry many choices of sub- 
jects are being offered and many kinds of vocational schools 
are being established. This brings home to the parent the 
serious problem of selecting the best course of study or 
sending the boy or the girl to the right kind of school — 
the best school for the particular boy and girl. Parents 
must study their children and by codperation with the 
trained teacher or vocational counselor attempt a better 
solution of this most important problem. 
~_Few parents understand the physiology or the psychology 
of the adolescent child. This fact alone has caused many 
a pupil to fail in school, has forced many a child to lie, 
steal, and form evil habits, and has driven many a boy 
and often a girl to leave home. When a boy begins to 
know, according to his own idea, a little more than his 
*[ 132]
-P-A-G-E-141
  
  A WORD TO PARENTS 
elders and begins to assert his own opinions, he is but 
trying out the strength of his growing ‘‘ manhood” and 
maturing intellect. Just as, in trying his growing muscles 
and sinews upon the football field, he must find resistance 
in order to test his strength, so must he meet opposition to 
his somewhat annoying self-assertiveness. But he resents 
interference ; he chafes under rules and all forms of re- 
straint. The wise football coach uses to advantage this 
determination to forge ahead regardless of others. The 
wise parent must do the same; for if not handled with 
judgment and guided rather than driven, the boy will break 
away. This is the time when he needs, as at no other 
time, sympathy, counsel, and gentle leading. That a boy 
does not get high marks in his studies while he is putting 
on twenty to fifty pounds of weight and adding six to ten 
inches to his stature, is no reason for condemnation. He 
does not need punishment or abuse. Now more than ever 
mother must love him; father must be his companion, his 
chum, his most intimate friend, to whom he will tell his 
innermost secrets. Yes, father, this means great sacrifice of 
time, pleasure, even business, but the boy is worth the price. 
The greatest service that a parent can give to the child 
toward securing for it a successful career is to lay.a foun- 
dation of habits that form a worthy ae Early im- 
pressions are the ones most firmly fixed in the mind and 
the hardest to erase. The character of the home determines 
these earliest impressions. Homes where prompt obedience 
is expected; where each member has his or her regular 
responsibilities and duties to perform, where there is an 
atmosphere of intelligence and morality, where wholesome 
food, pure air, and proper clothing are provided ; homes 
[133]
-P-A-G-E-142
    VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
where habits of living are temperate, where study and work 
are put first and play and amusement, though not omitted, 
are made secondary — such homes are laying the founda- 
tion that assures success in any and every vocation in lied 
The greatest peril which threatens the boys and girls 
the present generation is the desire upon the part of mis- 
taken parents to give their children every possible pleasure/~ 
to grant their every desire, never to cross them, but always 
to follow the path of least resistance. Social ambitions of 
parents for their children lead to undermined ideals and 
habits of life. There is no more unfortunate condition in 
the home than that of the rich or well-to-do family whose 
social life and ambitions are such that their home is not 
a fit place in which to bring up either a boy or a girl, so 
that the child’s only hope of salvation is in being sent away 
to the right kind of boarding school. The public school 
can hold the child but one fifth of his time. The other 
four fifths is spent under the influence of the home ‘and 
the community” No tutor can take the place of a father, 
no nursemaid or governess the place of the mother. 
Begin preparing your child for a successful career by 
making him form the habit of hard work and by teaching 
him to respect the man who toils.” Industry can be taught 
through habits of saving and climbing by one’s ow worthy 
efforts. Parents should inform themselves of the great call 
of the world. Beyond the crowded professions are vast 
fields calling for the scholarly engineer, ironworker, farmer, 
and captain of industry. If the schools do not give the 
opportunity for your boy to find himself, place him at work 
here or there during vacations,“where he can show what 
is in him. Watch him grow. Do not back him with

A WORD TO PARENTS 
money either in business or in higher education until he has 
proved himself worthy and capable. Above all, do not be 
discouraged if he is slow to show his ability. Some mature 
early; some are men grown before the awakening comes. 
In suggesting that parents keep in closer touch with 
the school and especially with the vocational counselor, 
I realize that teachers are not perfect in judgment, nor 
are they properly trained for giving vocational advice ; 4 
they have not yet had opportunity to prepare themselves 
for vocational counseling. Moreover, the public does not 
yet pay enough to secure the kind or standard of teacher 
that the parent would demand if the suggested codperation 
were to be seriously carried out. However, not all minis- 
ters, doctors, or even parents can be called excellent, and 
we cannot expect a larger proportion of infallibility among 
teachers. 
Parents’ meetings or clubs have accomplished a great 
deal of good where they have been made use of for the 
purpose of mutual understanding between teachers and 
parents. Educational leagues or societies for the purpose 
of bringing the schools into closer touch with the com- 
munity have served the same end. Parent, pupil, and 
teacher or counselor must work together in every way open, 
in order that the pupil may be directed in the choice and 
“preparation for a vocation. Parent and teacher must have 
faith in the boys and the girls, must believe that there is 
a place for each somewhere in the world’s work, and by 
gently guiding them, by patiently instilling in them habits 
of right thinking and acting, must lead them to the awaken- 
ing of their ambition prepared to work out safely their 
own destiny.

CHAPTER XIV 
VOCATIONAL COUNSELING 
No teacher can truly promote the cause of education, until he 
knows the mode of life for which that education is to prepare his 
pupil. — Ruskin 
The greatest trust between man and man is the trust of giving 
counsel. — BACON 
The first work in vocational guidance that was done in 
the United States was not connected with the public- 
school system. Men who had to deal with the drifting 
thousands of people that are always looking for a job or 
some better position than the one at the present time 
occupied, were the first to realize the need of helping 
these unfortunate wanderers into the kind of labor for 
which they were by nature and experience best fitted. To 
Mr. Frank Parsons of the vocation bureau of Civic Service 
Home in Boston is due the credit for introducing the 
methods of vocational guidance that have proved so valuable 
to workers in all branches of the movement. 
The number of people who are being called upon to 
advise the unfortunate misfits in life is increasing with 
the growth of social interest and the broader opportunities 
of charitable and public institutions, The problem of voca- 
tional guidance is a serious one.~|Not all social workers 
or teachers are qualified to give vocational advice. There 
is great danger through misinformed, prejudiced, or mis- 
directed opinion of doing more harm than good to the 
[137] 
   
-P-A-G-E-146
  VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
seeker after truth. \ A breadth of knowledge and experience 
in life, as well as an exceptional understanding of human 
nature, is absolutely necessary as a foundation for voca- 
tional counseling. Not only normal colleges and insti- 
tutions training teachers, but schools for librarians and 
social workers should give courses in vocational counseling, 
in order that this important work may be wisely done. 
That there is a widespread desire for direction in read- 
ing, in study, and in the seeking of employment is made 
evident by the increasing demands for evening schools, 
correspondence schools, and vocational schools of all 
kinds. Librarians in charge of reading and reference rooms 
are often called upon to assist misfits who are seek- | 
ing proper adjustment, by guiding them to some reading 
that will point the way out of their difficulty. Educa- 
tional secretaries of Young Men’s and Young Women’s 
Christian Associations are constantly asked to do voca- 
tional advising. Every social worker who is attempting to 
help unfortunate men and women finds himself confronted 
with this same problem: 
The first requisite for vocational counseling is a sym- 
pathetic understanding of human nature and pela 
This cannot be obtained by study. The counselor, inspire: 
by the spirit of his mission, must find success through 
rich experience. The second requisite is an intimate 
knowledge of vocations and of conditions under which 
young people are obliged to labor. This means a careful 
investigation of industry and of baa in the community 
in which the counselor is to work.) Such a study has 
been made in a number of different cities under the 
direction of a volunteer organization, employing an expert

V. Comments by Investigator 
Date of investigation Name of investigator 
  . The investigation of an industry for the purpose of 
obtaining the information needed by the counselor, who 
is assuming the responsibility of placing a boy or girl in 
that industry or in a particular factory, is very difficult. 
[140]
-P-A-G-E-149
  
VOCATIONAL COUNSELING 
The investigator should in the first place be an experienced 
worker in the industrial field, an expert in social service, in 
order that he may get near enough to the workers to see 
conditions from a just point of view. He must find his 
data in more than one way. Employer, manager or fore- 
man, and worker should all be consulted, and a personal 
tour of inspection through the plant should furnish most 
of the information needed. : 
A very satisfactory check upon any factory or employer 
is obtained by recording the reports of the workers who 
have been recommended to the place by the counselor. 
If they leave any position, the reasons for doing so should 
be determined after receiving a report from both the em- 
ployer and the employee. Then the counselor will be able 
to decide more justly whether he can recommend a second 
person to the same place. 
When a factory employs boys or girls who are under 
the legal age for leaving school, but who have left by special 
permission, the counselor may obtain valuable information 
by means of a “follow up” system — that is, a system 
of monthly reports signed by the employer and brought to 
the counselor by the employed boy or girl. This method, 
however, cannot be depended upon for those over the legal 
age, who cannot be compelled to report. 
The counselor must not only know the conditions of 
labor att pportunities for advancement in the industry 
and business, but he must be able to direct the applicant 
to a school or institution that will supply whatever training 
may be needed to prepare him for greater efficiency in 
the work he is to undertake. A survey should be made 
of opportunities for special training reasonably accessible 
[141]
-P-A-G-E-150
  VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
in the locality, state, or territory. Evening schools, part- 
time schools, or correspondence schools may be within the 
range of the applicant’s opportunity. If he can take the 
time and is not held down by a family or other ties, he 
may desire to go away to some kind of school that will 
supply his needs. In this case the requirements of admis- 
sion, the cost of living, the tuition, the opportunities of 
working one’s way, and the general standing of the insti- 
tution, are among the details that the efficient _ counselor 
should be familiar with before he can wisely direct the 
applicant toward a particular school. 
The problem of analyzing the applicant is possibly the 
most difficult part of vocational counseling. It is the most 
dangerous phase of the work, and the counselor should 
enter upon it with fear and trembling. Human judgment 
is frail, and experimental psychology has not yet been 
reduced to an exact science. There are many psycho- 
logical and physiological tests that can be made to prove 
an applicant’s unfitness for certain occupations. Some 
special keenness of the senses may serve to indicate fit- 
ness for a specific employment, but many are skeptical 
regarding the practical results that as yet have been ob- 
tained. The field of experimentation is still open before 
us, and in time the data gained may prove to be a most 
important adjunct to the equipment of the vocational 
counselor, 
The advice of the counselor should rarely if ever be 
positive. By this I mean that. the process of counseling 
should be more often in the negative, eliminating the 
various paths or vocations which are evidently impossible 
for the applicant or for which he is without doubt unfit. 
[ 142]
-P-A-G-E-151
  VOCATIONAL COUNSELING 
Then by being carefully guided through a process of 
self-analysis, he may be led to catch a vision of his’ call to 
service. The counselor must draw out from his applicant his 
innermost desire ; he must inspire him with self-confidence 
and a lasting determination to make the most of his oppor- 
tunities. Faith, not in the counselor but in himself, is the 
essential factor. For this reason the counselor must keep 
himself in the background and skillfully guide his client 
toward the realization of his own vocational aim.

questions has proved successful in experience: 4 4

    VOCATIONAL COUNSELING | 
When the applicant has filled out these questions care- 
fully and honestly, realizing that much of vital importance 
may be developed from his answers, he is in a favorable 
condition to receive advice. He must appreciate the fact 
that by evading the truth in any particular he is but de- 
feating the whole purpose of the interview and will gain 
nothing. By studying the answers the skillful counselor 
will usually find the line running through them that points 
quite definitely in a certain direction. 
The applicant can usually be advised to follow the course 
that will lead him to a better field of endeavor, but the 
actual solution of the problem depends, not upon the coun- 
selor, but upon the applicant himself. This must not only 
be made clear, but must be so impressed upon the one 
advised that he will start on his way with grim determina- 
tion to stick to his purpose until the goal has been reached. 
Very little experience in counseling will impress upon 
one the fact that all the plans just suggested will not have 
the desired result if the character of the applicant is at 
fault. The best of advice can be given regarding the 
vocational outlook, but the one receiving the advice must 
have the moral stamina to carry out the suggestions given. 
Often, indeed, the counselor will find that the guidance 
needed in the beginning is wholly moral. The following 
~ story will show the truth of this statement. 
A young man in the third year of the high school was 
drifting downward about as rapidly as he could. He was 
addicted to cigarette smoking; he did not even own the 
books from which he was supposed to study; he spent 
most of his time loafing, and for three semesters had not 
passed more than one subject a semester. He was naturally 
o145]
-P-A-G-E-154
  VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
bright, physically well developed, and of an attractive per- 
sonality. He was simply lazy, lacked the moral strength 
to force himself to work, and was acquiring harmful 
habits. After all other means had failed to get him to 
attend to his duties, it was arranged between his principal 
and his father that the boy should sign a written agree- 
ment that, if he did not show improvement in his studies 
within the next four weeks, he would go to work at such 
a place as the principal and his father might find for him. 
At the end of the four weeks he had not made good and, 
accordingly, was placed at work in a wholesale hardware 
store. When he left school the principal, who was his 
counselor, had a last good heart-to-heart talk with him, 
urging upon him some general business principles and 
certain moral truths. 
At the store the boy, whom we shall call Charlie, was 
placed in charge of the file department in one corner of 
the basement. The place was gloomy and very much in 
disorder, and he knew nothing about the different kinds 
of files or their uses. The first thing that he did was to 
make some new shelves and compartments where he could 
store the files according to sizes and shapes. After a short 
time he found that “sizes and shapes” was not all that 
he needed to know about files, so he went to the public 
library and found a book on the manufacture of files. 
Then, based upon his better knowledge, he rearranged 
his department and becczme much interested in his work. 
In June, after he had been employed about three months, 
the manufacturer’s agent came to see the head of the firm. 
The agent was given the opportunity to look over the 
stock of files and, while doing sd, discovered what unusual 
[14614 4
-P-A-G-E-155
VOCATIONAL COUNSELING 
   
        
     
                              
   
       information Charlie had acquired. At the agent’s sugges- 
tion the boy was called to the office and put through a 
stiff oral examination on the making and uses of files. 
The result was that Charlie, only eighteen years old, was 
made city salesman the next month, and in August was 
put on the road as a representative of the firm. 
But when September came, he felt dissatisfied with 
himself, in spite of his unexpected progress. He went 
to see the principal several times before he gained cour- 
age to tell what was troubling him. At length the intuition 
of the principal led to a question which brought forth the 
desired confidence. ‘“‘I have told you,” he said, “how 
splendidly I am getting along in the business. Well, I 
have been thinking about it a great deal lately, and I have 
figured it out that the reason why I have succeeded was 
that I remembered some of the things that you told me. 
I studied my business ; I applied what education I had to 
the job. Now, if a little education will do this much for 
me, I have simply got to have more. I can’t sleep nights, 
and I want to ask if you will take me back in school.” 
With what control of emotion the principal could muster, 
he put his hand on Charlie’s shoulder and assured him 
that he was welcome back ; that he did not doubt the boy’s 
sincerity of purpose and his ability to overcome old diffi- _ 
culties and to accomplish some day still greater success. 
Then began the vocational part of the guidance. Charlie’s 
school record was looked over, strong and weak lines dis- 
covered, tendencies and abilities noted, and, after as thor- 
ough a study of the situation as was possible, it was decided 
that to follow an engineering course was best. To finish 
the required work for graduation the following June meant 
[147 ] ‘ 
 
-P-A-G-E-156
VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
that he must pass six subjects each semester and make up 
two former conditions. He stuck to the heroic task until 
it was completed, and he did it so well that the faculty 
did not hesitate to give him the desired recommendation 
to the state university. 
The principal corresponded with Charlie for about two 
years, and then nearly six years elapsed without the inter- 
change of letters, the principal having in the meantime 
moved to another city. But finally, when he returned to 
his former city, he determined to trace the next chapter 
in the young man’s career. Inquiry brought him to the 
office of a certain large engineering company. There he 
presented his card to the office boy who requested it, and 
was soon ushered into the private office of Mr. HAs 
he entered the door Charlie rushed up to him, put his arm 
around him and exclaimed : “ Well, if this is not a strange 
coincidence! Look on my desk! There is a letter that I 
was just starting to write you. It was too personal to dic- 
tate to my stenographer, and I wanted to tell you something 
just as I used to do so long ago, and here you are your- 
self!”” After the interchange of a few remarks, Charlie 
told what he had intended to write: ‘‘ Since leaving the 
university I have been with this engineering company, 
which is, as you know, one of the largest of its kind in 
the country. I have been promoted from time to time, 
and the other day the president of this corporation came 
into my office to inform me that on next Wednesday, the 
first of the year, I am to assume the duties of head of one 
of the departments of this business at a very handsome 
salary. I just had to sit down to write you all about it, 
and to thank you for getting me on to the right track ; 
[ 148 ]   
 
-P-A-G-E-157
  VOCATIONAL COUNSELING 
and here you are, the one man in all the world that I 
would rather see right now than any other.” 
And so the counselor and his pupil sat down to talk 
over old times in the full enjoyment of happy recollections 
and the satisfaction of past work well done. 
This story is but typical of the counselor’s experience. 
Every teacher who has at heart the interest of the pupils 
who come under his or her influence has similar stories to 
tell. Each one has been doing vocational and moral coun- 
seling in his own way. The time has now come for more 
systematic and more scientific efforts. This chapter may 
prove suggestive to those who believe that vocational and 
moral guidance is a function of the public school, and 
that, therefore, it is the duty of those who undertake this 
work, to fit themselves for their great responsibility,

  CHAPTER XV 
THE PROBLEM OF PLACEMENT 
A great many men — some comparatively small men now — if put 
in the right position, would be Luthers and Columbuses. — CHAPIN 
The most serious problem within the entire vocational 
guidance movement is to determine the method of dealing 
with the vast army of boys and girls who are constantly 
leaving the public schools as soon as the law will permit. 
We are informed that there are about four million of these 
child laborers in our land. Most of these are doomed to 
lives of drudgery, to premature old age, and to many days , 
of poverty and misery. How to reach these children and 
to guide them to self-help is the question being asked by 
many of our large cities. Therefore, leaving the problem 
of directing the child who remains in school, which has 
been discussed in previous chapters, we shall confine our 
attention in this discussion to the placing of the child 
who is compelled to become a wage earner. 
The year nineteen hundred and fourteen finds surveys 
of this situation being made in every corner of the 
land. Boards of education and educators, Chambers of 
Commerce and employers, social workers and advisers of 
youth are everywhere investigating the causes of this 
enormous exodus from the public schools, the probable 
outlook for those boys and girls who have become wage

THE PROBLEM OF PLACEMENT 
earners, and the ultimate relationship between our educa- 
tional system and the industrial world. 
The Minneapolis survey showed that the reasons given 
for leaving school were in the following proportion: ill 
health, 5.7 per cent; ‘“‘had to go to work,” 35.5 per cent; 
child’s desire to earn money, 8.2 per cent; opportunity 
to keep vacation work, 2.6 per cent; dislike of school, or 
lack of interest in it, 29.5 per cent; trouble with teacher, 
3.1 per cent; failure to pass, 1.1 per cent; belief that 
further public-school work was not worth while, 14.2 per 
cent. The largest loss was shown to be at the point of 
graduation from the eighth grade. Many parents believe 
that this diploma stands for all that is necessary by way of 
education for their children, and are glad to have them 
leave to go to are he number dropping out in the 
first year of the high sthool is second in importance and 
is due largely to two facts: that the work is not adapted 
to the needs of those who must soon assume the responsi- 
bility of self-support, and that many during this year reach 
the age of sixteen, when they are free from the compulsory. 
education law. A third cause is summed up in the word 
“retardation.” ‘Failure opens the way to discouragement, 
which is followed by giving up the joby’ 
In the report of the Russell Sage Foundation upon its 
investigation in New York City, the cause of this great 
loss of pupils from the public schools is traced to four 
chief sources. The first of these is stated to be the “lack 
of adjustment between the length of the compulsory edu- 
cation period and the length of the school course.” The 
second source was “ preventable ill health or removable 
physical defects.” A third source was “irregular school 
[2531
-P-A-G-E-162

VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
attendance.” And the last was the evident fact “ that 
the courses of study were either too difficult or were not 
adapted to the average pupil.” While a great variety of 
reasons for leaving schodl may be given, most of them 
can be sifted down to these fundamental causes. The 
startling part of this revelation is the evident condemna- 
tion of the public schools. These sources of loss to the 
schools and the resulting penalty to be paid by the victims 
of the faulty system can and must be stopped. 
To remove these causes is the task of the school 
| authorities and the promoters of vocational training. It 
means a reformation in the curriculum and in the admin- 
istration of the schools of the future. Even in the event 
that our schools are transformed to meet all of the present 
criticism, we still shall have a great number who will not take 
the opportunities offered them, and we shall always have 
those whose financial circumstances are such that a permit 
to leave school to go to work, at least for part time, will 
be a necessity. We are forced to do something for the 
22 per cent of all the children in the United States be- 
tween the ages of fourteen and sixteen who are not now 
in school, and for the 61 per cent of those who enter the 
high school but do not remain to graduate. The task of 
following up this multitude, and attempting to guide each 
one toward the best work and study for him, is so enor- 
mous that we almost lose heart as we attack it. 
One step in the solution of the problem is certainly for 
the counselor to make a more scientific study of the child 
who must go to work and of the child who is already at 
work. In an effort to study the children who are at work, 
Mr. James S. Hiatt, secretary of the Public Education 
[154] 
 
-P-A-G-E-163
  
THE PROBLEM OF PLACEMENT 
Association of Philadelphia, has prepared a most careful 
study of his local situation. Of these children under six- 
teen years of age he has found that 43.4 per cent are in 
factories, 20.3 per cent in stores, 12.8 per cent in house- 
work, 8.7 per cent in offices, 6.3 per cent are listed under 
miscellaneous jobs, 3 per cent are in skilled trades, 2.5 per 
cent are messengers, 1.2 per cent are in service, and 1.5 
per cent are found in the various street trades. The wages 
earned by these children average from $2 to $6 a week. 
Of each dollar earned 58.6 cents comes from the factory, 
21.3 cents from the store, 9.5 cents from office work, 3.6 
cents from skilled trades, 3.5 cents from miscellaneous jobs, 
1.8 cents from the messenger service, and .7 of one cent 
from the street trades. The result of this survey showed 
among other things that the majority of those children who 
leave school at fourteen to enter industry are engaged in 
work which offers a large initial wage for simple mechani- 
cal processes, and which holds out little or no opportunity 
for improvement and certainly no sufficient competence 
at. maturity. 
As pointed out by Mr. Hiatt, no survey has yet been 
made that shows the disastrous effect of the monotonous 
strain of years of child labor upon mature life. It would 
be difficult to estimate the.loss of time and wages resulting 
from the constant changing of jobs and periods of idle- 
ness. No survey has yet shown the relation of school 
training to the job, nor of the actual needs of industry 
and business which can be met by public-school training. 
It is evident that the field of investigation is just being 
opened up, and many cities east and west are at work 
upon the problem. 
[155]

  VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
For the present we are convinced that the problem of 
placement is something vastly more important than that 
of securing the best possible jobs for those who are leaving 
school to become wage earners. Vocational counselors 
have come to realize that there is no “best” job for the 
child of fourteen years of age. The best job is in the 
best school that will give the best kind of training for the 
particular child, and when this training has been received, 
the best work for that individual is in that occupation in 
which his ability will secure for him a fair wage under proper 
conditions, with continual opportunity for self-improvement, 
and with a prospect for better things to come. For such a 
one as may be forced to leave school at fourteen years of 
age, or before he has received some vocational training, the 
best job is in that work which is nearest in line with his 
ambition and in which he can receive the training that he 
needs ; or his best job may be in some work which bears 
no relation to his future ambition but which brings the 
quickest financial return to enable him to continue his train- 
ing in the kind of school that will fit him for his chosen 
field. The solution of this problem lies in what may be 
called directed education — education that reaches out 
beyond the schoolroom into the school of experience. 
For this directed education to be effective, the coun- 
selor will need the support of proper compulsory education 
laws and child-labor laws. In the work of correlating such 
laws with the problem of placement, the most notable 
experiment that has yet taken place is that now being 
conducted by Mrs. Helen Thompson Woolley, director of 
the child-labor division of the Cincinnati public schools. 
Through the efforts of Miss M. Edith Campbell of the

THE PROBLEM OF PLACEMENT 
Schmidlapp Bureau, the plan was made possible. The 
Ohio child-labor law, which is one of the best now in 
force, gives to one office sufficient authority to make the 
necessary investigations, The superintendent of schools 
has delegated to this bureau the power to issue the work 
certificates, and in this way every child who leaves school 
to go to work must go through this office. 
In making application for a work certificate several 
important steps must be taken. The principal of the 
school must fill out a record that tells of the pupil’s 
scholarship, conduct, habits of work, etc. The birth 
record must be secured from the pastor of the church at 
which the child was christened or confirmed, or from the 
bureau of vital statistics of the place in which the child 
was born. Then the child must run the gauntlet of the 
board of health and secure a health record. The record 
includes’ family history, personal history, and the more 
important physical tests of heart, lungs, vision, hearing, 
etc. The fourth step in the process is to secure the 
contract with the employer. This is one of the strongest 
points in the Ohio system. The employer agrees that he 
will employ the child for not more than eight hours a day, 
six days in the week, between the hours of 7 a.m. and 
6 p.M.; that he will codperate with the public-school 
authorities in obtaining the attendance of said child at a 
continuation school as long as the child shall be under 
sixteen years of age and in his employ, provided such 
child has not completed the eighth grade; that he will 
return the working certificate to the certificate office within 
two days of the child’s withdrawal or dismissal from his 
employ, giving the reason for such withdrawal or dismissal, 
[157] 
 
-P-A-G-E-166
  
  VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
The Ohio continuation-school law states that “‘in case 
the Board of Education of any school district establishes 
part-time day schools for the instruction of youth over 
fourteen years of age who are engaged in regular employ- 
ment, such Board of Education is authorized to require 
all youth who have not satisfactorily completed the eighth 
grade of the elementary school to continue their school- 
ing until they are sixteen years of age; provided, how- 
ever, that such youth, if they have been granted age and 
schooling certificates and are regularly employed, shall 
be required to attend school not to exceed eight hours a 
week between the hours of 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. during the 
school term.” 
Wisconsin has provided for a similar plan in recent 
legislation, and other states are following the lead. While 
these laws are splendid steps in advance of the general 
practice in the country, it is to be hoped that as in some 
parts of Europe the next steps will be in the direction of 
extending the time of compulsory education beyond the 
age of fourteen, and, regardless of graduation from the 
eighth grade, of requiring boys and girls to attend some 
part-time or vocational school, as their vocational direction 
may demand, until they are eighteen years of age. Such 
a requirement will bring an immediate demand upon the 
public-school system to provide for this host of boys and 
girls the kind of schooling that is adapted to their needs 
and that will prepare them for the occupation which they 
will enter when they reach the age limit. 
It is not the purpose of this discussion to enter into 
the problem of industrial education. However, from the 
point of view of the vocational director, it is necessary to 
[ 158 ]
-P-A-G-E-167
  
THE PROBLEM OF PLACEMENT 
answer the question so often asked, “In just what way 
does vocational guidance hitch up with vocational train- 
ing?” The general answer is, “In just the same way 
that it hitches up with professional or commercial train- 
ing.” Yet the present demand for industrial training — 
incorrectly called ‘‘ vocational” training — is imperative 
upon the part of children who have left the public schools 
and who have already shown by their retardation that they 
are not adapted to an academic curriculum. 
The first step in the reformation of the public schools 
is illustrated by the experiments already being tried in 
Los Angeles, Chicago, Grand Rapids, Cleveland, Cincin- 
nati, Philadelphia, New York, and Boston. This step is 
to offer prevocational courses in the seventh and eighth 
grades. In order to carry out this scheme most effectively, 
specially organized schools have been developed under the 
name of “‘prevocational,”’ ‘‘ intermediate,” or ‘‘junior high,” 
school. The intermediate, or junior high, school covers the 
seventh, eighth, and ninth grades of the usual public- 
school system. In these schools the pupils are carefully 
directed into one of three prevocational courses. With 
all pupils taking the fundamental branches of grammar, 
arithmetic, and geography and history in much the same 
manner, the fourth subject offered indicates the differenti- 
ation. This selection may be along the line of the academic 
curriculum for those looking toward college and the pro- 
fessions ; thus, they may elect Latin or German or some 
other academic branch. Those whose tastes and desires lean 
toward a business career may take as their election ele- 
mentary bookkeeping and other commercial practice. 
Those who think they would like to enter an industrial line 
[159 ] 
 
-P-A-G-E-168
  VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
are given a practical kind of manual training, affording 
sufficient opportunity for them to discover their ability in 
this kind of work. In these schools the three groups of 
pupils are not separated so far that they cannot be changed 
over from one course to another, as the fundamental 
studies are not disturbed. (The first great aim of the 
scheme is to test out by experience and close observation 
those who may profit most by following certain lines of 
study. When properly administered this system of schools 
should direct pupils most accurately toward the right 
courses of study in the high school, toward the right 
kind of vocational school, or toward the right kind of 
work if work is a necessity, 
The second step in meeting the demand of vocational 
direction is the establishment of industrial schools of sec- 
ondary —o Several kinds of experiments are being 
made in different parts of the country. The trade schools 
have not, however, proved entirely popular. Not over 
fifteen such scnools had been established at the close. of 
1913. They have proved costly. The pupils are without 
income and in some schools must pay very heavy fees. 
It is generally conceded that for these reasons the trade 
school has not offered an adequate solution for the problem 
of industrial education. 
The form of industrial training which seems to be 
making the greatest headway in the country is that car- 
ried on in the continuation school. In the report of 
the committee on industrial education appointed by the 
National Association of Manufacturers of the United 
States of America, the following argument is presented : 
“These continuation schools must be established in every 
[ 160 ] 
 
-P-A-G-E-169
  THE PROBLEM OF PLACEMENT 
industrial community in our land. There is no other way 
of completing or making adequate in any sense the edu- 
cation of one half of our children.” It is perfectly reasonable 
to admit that skilled workmen cannot be made in a school, 
and also that they cannot, under the present system, be 
wholly made without some assistance from the school. The 
machinery, atmosphere, and. discipline of the shop cannot 
be created in the school. The factory cannot, on the other . 
hand, take the time to instruct the workers in the theory 
and practice which they need to become more efficient or 
progressive employees. This form of school, for those who 
leave school as soon as the law permits, must be held in 
the daytime, and never should the child of from fourteen 
to sixteen be compelled to attend night school after working 
all day in the store or factory. It is also demanded that 
wages should be continued while the child is in attendance 
at the continuation school, as a just charge against the 
employer who thus receives a direct benefit. 
It is this kind of school in which the vocational director 
is particularly interested. The problem of placement re- 
quires the adjustment of the continuation school to the 
child at work. When the local board of education does 
not provide the kind of continuation school that is needed, 
the director must show the demand and secure the estab- 
lishment of the courses desired. By closely following the 
careers of those who have been placed at work and who 
fail at their tasks, or who do not make proper headway, 
the vocational director can find out whether the school is 
at fault, and, if so, wherein it can be improved. In this 
way our entire educational system will be made more 
practical and more efficient. 
[ 161 ]
-P-A-G-E-170
  (WOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE) 
Before effective work can be done by a vocation bureau 
in solving the problem of placement, most of our state 
laws will need to be changed./ Compulsory school and 
labor laws must be made in the Miterests of the child and 
its future efficiency rather than in favor of the exploiters 
of child labor. (These laws should provide for compulsory 
education until fourteen years of age for the physically 
and mentally normal child’ ) They should provide forms 
of industrial training that will meet the needs of the 
workers in the given com < should also provide 
for a proper taking of the sc census, the reporting of 
pupils attending private and parochial schools to the local 
superintendent of schools, and the adequate. following up 
of truancy. Such laws should give to some officer of the 
school board the power of a labor or factory inspector to 
investigate the conditions of child labor in the community 
and to use his knowledge in granting working permits to 
children, When a working permit has been granted to a 
child, the law should compel the employer to report 
monthly to the school authority the fact that the child is 
still in his employ and to notify such authority at once 
when the child leaves or is discharged, But few states 
have laws that meet these requirements, yet every director 
of a vocational bureau finds that the interests of the child 
demand that there shall be no loopholes in the system if 
the problem of placement is to be satisfactorily handled.

CHAPTER XVI 
A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN OF ORGANIZATION 
FOR CITIES 
The real democratic American idea is, not that every man shall 
be on the level with every other, but that every one shall have liberty, 
without hindrance, to be what God made him. —H. W. BEECHER 
The national movement for the promotion of vocational 
guidance began in this country with the work of the Boston 
Bureau under the direction of Mr. Meyer Bloomfield, who 
organized the first national conference on vocational guid- 
ance in the fall of 1910. The work had been almost 
simultaneously started in other parts of the country, and 
the conference served to bring together the people who 
were leading in the movement. Some were from the 
public schools, some from the colleges, and others were 
from social-service organizations and Christian Associa- 
tions. Chambers of commerce and employers were also 
represented showing the widespread interest in a movement 
to adjust and prevent vocational misfits. 
The second national conference was held in New York 
City in 1912, and in 1913 a permanent organization of 
national scope was perfected in Grand Rapids, Michigan. 
Asa result of these conferences and the experiments carried 
on in various centers since the beginning of the movement, 
amore or less comprehensive plan for promoting and organ- 
izing a department of vocational guidance may be outlined. 
[ 163 ]
-P-A-G-E-172
         VOCATIONAL AND MORAL ibe: 
The first step in this process is usually an educational 
campaign to awaken the public to an appreciation of ghe 
need for a local system of vocational guidance. Such 
organizations as the Chamber of Commerce, the Young 
Men’s Christian Association, the Board of Education, and 
the Associated Charities are all interested in the problem of 
the misfit and can be depended upon to coéperate in the 
movement. In the city of Cleveland a representative com- 
mittee of one hundred undertook to study the question by 
bringing to that city prominent workers in the field of 
vocational guidance from different parts of the country 
to tell of their work. Other cities have made notable sur- 
veys such as that of Miss Alice P. Barrows, director of 
the Vocational. Education Survey of New York City. 
Mr. James S. Hiatt, secretary of the Public Education 
Society of Philadelphia, has published the result of a sur- 
vey in that city, entitled ‘‘ The Child, the School, and the 
Job.” A very instructive survey has been made in the 
city of Minneapolis and published by the Teachers’ Club 
of that city. The recommendations made by the Minne- 
apolis committee in reporting the result of its investigation 
are so significant of the value of the survey, that the ten 
articles are quoted, as follows : 
“1, That as rapidly as would be economical, the schools 
be organized on the ‘ six-three-and-three’ plan, beginning 
differentiated courses in the B7 grade. These courses 
should follow three broad lines: (1) leading toward the 
academic courses in high schools; (2) toward the com- 
mercial courses, or directly to business; and (3) toward 
manual training in high school, or directly to manufacturing 
and mechanical pursuits. 
[ 164 ]
-P-A-G-E-173
  
A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN OF ORGANIZATION 
“2, That preparation for the trades can be best and 
most economically given in continuation schools, in which 
the instruction shall be closely related to working condi- 
tions, while the necessary skill shall be gained in actual 
work under the usual commercial conditions. 
“3, That the membership of the Thomas Arnold 
School be enlarged to include all boys who have reached 
the age of fifteen and have not yet reached the seventh 
grade. And that a similar school be organized for girls. 
“4. That a Department of Vocational Guidance be 
organized. It should attempt the following work: Ist, a 
survey of the business and industries of the city, giving 
accurate and complete information regarding the wages, 
hours of labor, chances of promotion, sanitation, and 
moral conditions of each occupation. 2d, a survey to 
indicate clearly the value of the present courses of instruc- 
tion in our schools; in this should be included a com- 
parison with the product of business colleges and other 
schools, and the opinions of employers regarding the 
qualifications of the young persons in their employ. 3d, 
vocational guidance, which shall assist a child with his 
parent to find his proper place at work; establish a 
bureau of information for employers and those seeking 
employment; at its discretion, within the law, issue all 
labor permits ; and have general oversight of the boys and 
girls at work. 
““5. That a set of records be kept of each pupil, giving 
a complete account of his home conditions, his physical 
condition, and his mental and emotional characteristics, 
upon which information may be based a judgment con- 
cerning his future occupation. 
[ 165]
-P-A-G-E-174
  VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
“6, That as an adjunct to the Board of Education an 
Advisory Commission of fifteen members, composed of 
employees, employers, and educators be established, whose 
duty it shall be to report changes in the demands of busi- 
ness and industry, and to advise modifications of the 
course of study to meet these new demands. 
“7, That a law should be enacted, making it manda- 
tory that a boy shall be either in school or at work up to 
his eighteenth year, and that the Department of Voca- 
tional Guidance be charged with the duty of enforcing 
such a provision. 
“8. That a School Census be taken of the city, the 
purpose being that all children of school age shall be in 
school, and that the Board of Education may, have the 
benefit of this information in planning for the’ future of 
the city’s school system. 
“9. That an age-grade census of all pupils in school 
be taken, to determine where retardation is taking place ; 
this should be followed by a study of conditions in order 
to remove the causes of retardation. 
“to. That the Committee endorses the effort in the 
legislature to secure a Commission to report at the next 
session upon the whole subject of public charities, includ- 
ing the relief of destitute widows ; and the idea embodied in 
a bill before the present legislature establishing a minimum 
wage for girls and women.” 
As was shown in another chapter, the department of 
vocational guidance should be a part of the system of 
public schools and, therefore, under the control of the 
board of education. This department must not be liable 
to the charge that it is supported by an organization of 
[ 166 ]
-P-A-G-E-175
  
A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN OF ORGANIZATION 
employers or that it is a scheme to exploit child labor. It 
must not be crippled in any way in making its investiga- 
tions of occupations or in exercising its judgment in the 
placing of boys and girls at work. For these reasons, in 
addition to the claim that vocational guidance is an educa- 
tional function, the department should be created and 
maintained by the local board of education. 
The work of this department may be briefly outlined 
under the following headings : 
1. To make a local survey of vocational opportunities. 
2. To make a survey of opportunities for vocational 
training. 
3. To promote through the public-school course of 
study a systematic effort to direct boys and girls in the 
choice of and preparation for a vocation. 
4. To make a local survey of conditions under which 
boys and girls are employed. 
5. To maintain a kind of employment bureau for the 
pupils who leave school at or before graduation. 
6. To have general oversight over the system of grant- 
ing permits to go to work and of following up those boys 
and girls under eighteen years of age who are at work. 
This department should be under the direction of an 
executive officer appointed by the board of education. If 
possible this person should be an educator, an expert 
counselor of youth and one of broad knowledge and 
experience in both industrial and commercial life. Such 
a person may be very difficult to find, yet the ideal is not 
altogether impossible. We must either draw out the edu- 
cator from his realm of books and send him out into the 
world of affairs to learn of the problems that his pupils 
[ 167 ]  
-P-A-G-E-176
  VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
must meet when they go out from the schools, or we must 
take the man of broad experience in the field of action 
and teach him how to deal with children, how to know 
them and Jead them toward the fulfillment of their life 
purpose. (It would seem the easier proposition to take the 
wide-awaké and ambitious teacher who is enthusiastic about 
his mission to mold the lives of the boys and girls in his 
charge, and to broaden his vision of the call of the world 
and to train him in the technique of the vocational coun- 
selor. This process of guiding youth in choosing, pre- 
paring for, and making entrance into a vocation is very 
largely a matter of knowledge of the individual and of 
direction in education. The vocational counselor who is 
outside the public schools, and who loses the personal 
acquaintance and the vital touch with the lives of the 
young people, is thereby less able to direct boys and girls 
wisely than is the properly trained teacher. Therefore 
the vocational director of the future will probably be de- 
veloped from persons already in the educational system} 
The vocational director should be given authority to 
direct the counseling to be done by the teachers in the 
public schools. First, he should assist in promoting the 
plan of instruction that may be introduced in the course 
of study. Secondly, he should have the assistance of a 
representative from each building, who will look after the 
pupils that need special counsel or that may be forced to 
leave school and seek employment. This means that the 
director will act as an instructor and organizer of the 
teachers who are to serve as counselors and assistants. 
A system of school records that will give the counselor 
the desired information regarding the pupil must be devised 
[ 168 ] 
 
-P-A-G-E-177
  
A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN OF ORGANIZATION 
and placed in operation. In most states when the pupil 
leaves school to go to work, if he is under sixteen years 
of age and has not completed the eighth grade, he must 
obtain a permit from the superintendent of schools. This 
power of granting permits should be delegated by the 
superintendent to the department of vocational guidance. 
Then a copy of the record card is transferred from the 
school to the office of the vocational director. From this 
card he will obtain the necessary data upon which to base 
his interview with the pupil. The form of pupil’s record 
card for the grades may be suggestive.1 
In the high school a vocational record can easily be 
combined with the scholarship record already in use. A 
card system quite generally prevails, and, if the reverse 
side of the card is not used for the scholarship record, it 
may be used to serve the purpose of a separate system. 
The card shown on page 170 will illustrate the method 
suggested. 
From these records the principal or counselor can obtain 
the data that will be of most value in making recommenda- 
tions or in placing the pupils in suitable positions. 
The office of the vocational director should be near that 
of the superintendent of schools for several reasons. It 
must be centrally located to be easy of access for teachers 
and for pupils. If a system of approving or controlling 
the issuing of permits to pupils under sixteen years of age 
—or whatever the legal age may be —is to be carried 
out in codperation with the superintendent of schools, the 
office should be conveniently located. It should also be 
so situated that employers or the general public who may

GENERAL REMARKS 
   
-P-A-G-E-179
A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN OF ORGANIZATION 
wish to make use of the information to be found there 
can reach the office with the least loss of time. 
There is a broad field of opportunity to extend the use- 
fulness of this office beyond its service to the public-school 
system. While it is best to do all that is possible to pre- 
vent vocational misfits, we cannot hope to stop them all, 
and there will always be many who must be aided in re- 
adjusting themselves. The vocational director is at the 
command of the public. Any one who desires advice 
regarding his life work and the possibility of bettering his 
condition can often find here the very help he needs in 
making the necessary adjustment. Educational secretaries 
of the Young Men’s and Young Women’s Christian As- 
sociations, not having vocational counselors of their own 
to assist in directing inquirers regarding suitable courses 
of study, could obtain expert assistance from the director. 
Social workers in many fields, judges of juvenile courts, 
and all persons interested in the welfare of the boy or girl 
will find frequent use for the service of this office. 
Back of the vocational director is the board of educa- 
tion representing the citizens. For this reason it may not 
be necessary to suggest the advisability of a commission 
or committee to codperate with the director. In some 
localities, however, such a commission will be a néces- 
sity if the work of the director is to be kept free from 
political or partisan interference. When such is the case 
this commission should be chosen in some manner to pre- 
vent such interference, and should represent the varied 
interests in the community that in any way may be con- 
cerned with the work of the department. The laboring 
classes as well as the employers should have a share in 
[171]
-P-A-G-E-180
  VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
shaping the director’s policy of neutrality in his work. The 
primal interest of the boy and girl must be maintained. 
When unjust demands are made or when opposition to the 
judgments of the director arises, there must be a nonparti- 
san or broadly representative commission back of the direc- 
tor to secure justice and to support the authority placed in 
the department. This commission may be large or small ac- 
cording to the local situation, but in accordance with general 
experience a small body will usually do more effective work. 
The foll6wing outline will sum up a general plan of 
vocational guidance for any locality.

A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN OF ORGANIZATION 
One of the first tasks of a vocation bureau is to secure 
the interest and codperation of the business men of the 
community. If the bureau is to succeed in its task of 
bringing the public schools into closer relationship with 
commercial and industrial interests, it must make its appeal 
to the busy men of affairs in such a way that they will give 
heed to the call. There are many ways of attacking this 
problem. Lectures and addresses before clubs and gather- 
ings of all kinds will help. Newspaper support is necessary 
and most valuable. Associations or chambers of commerce 
should back the movement. The following material has 
been used successfully by one vocation bureau in the form 
of a circular sent to the employers of boys and girls. 
A Word to Emfloyers 
The Vocation Bureau a 
Clearing House 
E.are not exactly an employment bureau, although 
we are often in a position to find boys and girls 
for employers when they apply to us. Neither do we in- 
tend to find employment for all of the pupils who leave 
school to go to work. We do plan to act as advisers to 
the employer who wishes to know more about the appli- 
cant for a position, and to the boys and girls who are leav~ 
ing school to find work, assisting them to select the best 
work for themselves and to prepare themselves for more 
efficient service,

CONTRIBUTION I 
TEACHING VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE IN THE 
SEVENTH AND EIGHTH GRADES 
By Mary NEWELL Eaton 
Statistics tell us that a very large number of children 
never reach the high school. Several reasons are assigned 
for this, but two of the most important are that they do 
not know the value of an education and that they have 
no real ambition to push ahead. All of them are weaving 
imaginary futures : some, the worldly-wise ones, are launch- 
ing themselves on careers at, the completion of the eighth 
grade; others, the shielded, see high school, college, and 
the career beyond. Neither group really knows much of 
the world at large; the former know their immediate en- 
vironment, but not its possibilities, and the latter know the 
world only by hearsay. It is left to the teacher to stimulate 
this vivid imagination so as to arouse the pupil’s ambition 
to make something of himself. It is thought this can best 
be done through a study of the occupations of the world 
or through a study of the lives of successful people. 
However, before any real ambition can be stimulated, 
it is necessary to arouse the interest of the class in this 
work, The girls are especially hard to interest. Neither 
machinery nor games appeal to them; they do not care 
about the commerce of the world. It is rather difficult 
to tell exactly what the girl of this age is interested in, 
[177]
-P-A-G-E-186
  
VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
though sometimes music or art or housekeeping arouses 
her. Secretly she expects to marry. Why then burden 
her mind with agriculture or plumbing or manufacturing ? 
She thinks the whole study of vocations was made for the 
boy, and so sits back in a resigned and helpless manner, 
indifferent to the work. Her attitude says, “‘ If occupations 
must be studied, I shall do as little as I can.” The boy, 
on the other hand, thinks that this is the greatest subject 
in school; the school authorities have at last decided to 
give something that gets down to life and his needs. He 
will do extra work with pleasure, and begs for the allotted 
time to be extended. 
It is difficult to state definitely the amount of time that 
should be given to this work. Sometimes it may take 
weeks to get the interest of the class before actually be- 
ginning. It is never advisable to state at first that this is 
a study of vocations. Sometimes one exercise — and they 
are all long — should be given each month, and sometimes 
more real value ensues from a concentrated study every 
day, for two or three weeks. The allotment of time de- 
pends entirely on the class — their interest, the ease with 
which they attack the subject, and the good they get out 
of it. 
In working out the exercises for the seventh and eighth 
grades, it was necessary to consider the conditions that had 
to be faced. Young people of this age (twelve or thirteen) 
think in terms of the concrete, therefore the work of this 
period has to be made concrete. Ifa boy is asked to explain 
how to run an engine, he can tell because he can see it 
and handle it. The facts come easily to mind, for the sub- 
ject is concrete. But if, on the other hand, he is asked to 
[178]
-P-A-G-E-187
TEACHING VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 
explain why he likes a certain book or a certain person, he 
is lost in a sea of vague and uncertain ideas. He knows 
he does or does not like the book, yet to tell even one 
reason is very difficult. Consequently the subjects for 
composition are chosen largely with regard to their special 
adaptability, and when they seem abstract, it is hoped the 
teacher may bridge the gap by asking stimulating questions. 
The idea is to try to make the subject seem real and im- 
portant to the individual. 
Two other characteristics that were considered in mak- 
ing the exercises were hero-worship and optimism. Young 
people are admirers of the great, but yet they do not like 
to read about them themselves, for often the books are too 
large or the language is too complicated{ It is unfortunate 
that there are so few good lives of truly successful people 
in simple form. The teacher should take care, in selecting 
a list of biography for these grades, that the lives are 
written in simple, entertaining English and are accounts 
of occupations that are varied in extent. The other quality 
that must be taken into consideration is the pupils’ su- 
preme faith in success. They are all going to be successful 
themselves, of course. One never reads of unsuccessful 
men, and all the boys and girls‘they have known — within 
two or three years of their own age — have been success- 
ful. I verily believe a “blind alley” job seems a successful 
occupation to the seventh-grade boy or girl, for the three 
or four dollars he receives spells wealth, and the prospec- 
tive ten means luxury. The best thing that I know to 
convince the eighth-grade pupil that this is not true is 
to have older pupils, who have been out of school and 
returned, talk to them on “Why I Came Back,” or to 
[179 ]  
-P-A-G-E-188
  VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
get comparative figures of wages of eighth-grade and high- 
school graduates. 
It should be the purpose of the teacher during the 
seventh grade to arouse the ambition of the pupils, and 
during the eighth to attempt to show them the value of 
an education. The exercises on occupations and biography 
(the first seven) belong to the first class, and it will be 
seen that they lend themselves easily to both oral and 
written composition. It has been found advisable to carry 
on this vocational-guidance work in connection with the 
study of geography and grammar. 
EXERCISE I 
‘THE STUDY OF AN OCCUPATION 
It is better to begin this by a study of the occupations in the 
home city and those the pupils can find out about easily. Each 
pupil can be asked to tell or write about an occupation such as 
his father’s or some relative’s. He should be given a list of 
topics to guide him in his inquiry, so that he may discuss the 
subject understandingly. 
SUGGESTED OUTLINE 
1. Name of occupation. 
. Explain the work. (Here could follow a detailed account 
of the work, a description of the place where the work 
is carried on, the machinery used, the lighting system, 
hours per day, effect on the health of the worker, the 
ventilation, or anything else that would interest the 
class.) 
3. What education would a man need before entering it? 
4. How can one get into it?

  TEACHING VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 
EXERCISE II 
THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF AN OCCUPATION 
LIST OF QUESTIONS 
1. In what foreign countries can this occupation be found ? 
The names of the leading European, African, South 
American, etc., countries should be placed across the 
top of the blackboard, and the occupations that the 
children name placed in a column at the left. Then 
every country where the occupation is found could 
be checked. Each continent should be studied sepa- 
rately. In this way the class would get a very clear 
idea of the extent of the occupation. It is wise for 
the teacher to guide the choice of occupations listed, 
so that there would be a wide range of subjects. The 
whole value of this vocational work is lost unless the 
pupils learn that there are other occupations besides 
the few they know. The exercise may give them an 
incentive to look into new occupations. 
2. How does the occupation in these other countries differ 
from it as I know it? 
3- Where should I especially like to live to follow it? Why? 
(@) Is the country healthier ? 
(4) Does the country give me more opportunity to ex- 
pand my occupation ? 
(¢) Could I live contentedly in the country? 
EXERCISE III 
Aw AccounT oF A TRIP 
This trip could be one taken through a manufacturing plant 
or an office building or a store. The occupation is studied first- 
hand. All young people like to tell of interesting places, and 
usually tell their experiences very well.

Why this occupation is of interest to me. 
Give a detailed account of the trip, showing pictures of 
the place, and explaining several interesting processes,

Where is the output of this occupation sold or distributed? 
Is it a vital necessity to man? that is, could he do without 
it in times of financial trouble? 
. Do men who work in it render any service to the com- 
munity aside from their personal gain ? 
EXERCISE IV

. What is the most interesting occupation that we have 
heard about? Why? 
. Which take a long preparation ? 
. Which require an educational training ? 
. Which are trades? professions? jobs? 
. Which should I especially like to follow if I lived in New 
York? San Francisco? Panama? London? 
EXERCISE V 
Tue Lire or A SUCCESSFUL PERSON 
The first thing in the study of biography is to read to the 
class the life of some man or woman who has been successful, 
in the best sense of that word, and who has not lived earlier 
than the eighteenth century. The more the character appears 
to be in touch with present-day conditions, the more alive ‘he 
seems, and the more heed the children pay. After the reading 
the teacher should lead the class to talk about the life, trying 
[ 182 ]
-P-A-G-E-191
TEACHING VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 
to bring out the kind of man or woman this person was. She 
should conform to the following questions, which are to be 
given out after the recitation is concluded. 
WORKING QUESTIONS 
When and where did —— live? 
What work did he do? 
What was the most important point in his life? 
What pleasures did he have? 
. What made his work successful ? 
. Did he render service to his fellowmen ? 
. Did he live by any law, or motto, or aim of his own mak- 
ing? What was his guide (law, motto, aim), and was 
it a good one or not? Why? some grs 
The pupils should take this set of questions home to study. 
The next day the teacher can make this an exercise in oral 
composition by asking them to tell what has been read the day 
before, or she can have them write the answers in school inde- 
pendently. She should permit all the preparation necessary, but 
impress upon the class that the marking is to be on how well 
they have told what they know. The pupils should be permitted 
to use the dictionary during the writing, but the teacher should 
give no assistance and she should not allow the pupils to reread 
the biography. They should be expected to write what they re- 
member from the first reading, assisted by the questions above. 
Here is an opportunity for composition work that is really worth 
while. 
EXERCISE VI 
ASSIGNED BIOGRAPHY 
The next work of this kind is to assign one biography to each 
pupil, and then proceed as before. This makes a better exercise 
in oral composition than in written, for all the class should hear 
all the lives. It also gives the teacher an opportunity to ask 
questions to bring out points that the pupil might overlook. 
[ 183 ] 
 
-P-A-G-E-192
VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
EXERCISE VII 
BroGRAPHY 
If the teacher cares to have another exercise of like nature, 
she can ask the pupil to tell the life of some member of his 
own family, or of some friend, that he thinks has become suc- 
cessful. This will lead naturally to a consideration of the life of 
the pupil himself, 
EXERCISE VIII 
AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF THE PuPIL 
This exercise is always a very interesting one from the 
teacher’s standpoint, for it establishes a personal relationship 
between teacher and pupil that will make the teacher a sym- 
pathetic friend as well as a judicious guide. As this should be 
a written composition and written very fully, she often learns 
facts about the individual that she can use very effectively in 
reaching him, Many times after reading the autobiography she 
is able to recommend reading or games that will especially 
please because she knows the pupil’s taste. 
The outline given for the pupil to work on will vary greatly 
with the school. Some teachers will wish to have much infor- 
mation and some teachers less. Whatever is asked, the pupil 
should be told that this exercise will be regarded as a confidential 
communication. 
SUGGESTED OUTLINE 
1. My birthplace, age, and early life. 
2. My family: nationality of parents, their occupations, 
brothers and sisters, pets, etc. 
3. My health (a very important topic). 
4. In what study I have made the best record. Why? The 
study I like the best. Why? 
5. My favorite game, book, character in history, etc.

EXERCISE IX 
PERSONAL EXPERIENCES 
In teaching the value of an education, the teacher finds it 
worth while to know the life of the pupil and then to assign 
a series of themes that deal with the events in his life in 
expanded form. Such subjects as “How I earned my First 
Money,” “My First Real Work,” “How I spend my Satur- 
days,” are good to use. 
MY FIRST REAL WORK 
(Questions given to assist in the preparation of the theme) 
1. How old were you when you did your first real work ? 
2. What kind of work was it? 
3- How did you get it? Did you hunt it, or did you pro- 
cure it through some one else? 
. Was it steady work? or did the firm want you only a 
short time ? 
How long did it take to complete the work ? 
Are you working at it now? How long have you worked ?

g. Why did you leave the work ?

Why? or why not? 
The pupil should be impressed with the fact that these ques-_ 
tions are not to be answered mechanically. They are only given 
as a guide. 
EXERCISE X 
TECHNICAL TERMS 
After the teacher finds out what the pupil has done, what 
his ability is, and what he would like to do, she can explain 
such terms as occur during the study of vocations. This exer- 
cise can be oral or written by the whole class or made a group 
exercise, one topic being assigned to several pupils so that all 
the technical terms can be covered in one recitation. Below are 
two outlines of terms that are common. 
BLIND-ALLEY JOBS 
. What are “ blind-alley ” jobs ? 
. Give two or more examples. 
. How do people get into blind-alley jobs ? 
. What does the work consist of ? Does it require strength 
or brains ? 
. What special quality should the person have? 
. What is the pay of a beginner? What is the rate of 
increase? What is the highest wage paid? 
7. What opportunity is there for the person to advance? 
POKH ann 
APPRENTICE SYSTEM 
x. What is an apprentice system? 
2. What occupations require apprentices ? 
3. What pay do they get while serving? How long does the 
apprentice have to serve? 
[ 186]

TEACHING VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 
4. What is the pay for skilled workers? What is the rate 
of increase? 
5. What is the work like? Does it require any special 
education ? 
EXERCISE XI 
THE VALUE OF AN EDUCATION 
Though young persons think that all people are successful, it 
is well to have them hear the story of how these became so. 
Usually the account of their struggles is very interesting. The 
first and most entertaining of these talks can be given by some 
boy or girl who has actually learned the value of an education. 
In every class there are pupils that have dropped out at the 
end of the eighth grade, because of sickness or lack of money, 
but returned to school after a period spent at work. The pupils 
in school always enjoy hearing these young people, because they 
are near their own age. The story seems truer than if some 
older person tells it. 
It is well to give the talker a guide so that he will not ramble. 
Here is a suggested outline: 
WHY I CAME BACK TO SCHOOL 
1. The reason why I left: illness, illness in the family, lack 
of money to stay in school, etc. 
2. The way I was first inspired to return: talk with a friend, 
desire to enter another occupation, etc. 
What enabled me to return — money or other aid? 
Discouragements and how to face them. 
5. Ways of earning money to stay in school: working in the 
school, in the lunch room; taking care of children 
in the afternoons for tired mothers; clerking in 
stores, etc. 
6. Why I think an education is valuable. 
[187 ] ae 
 
-P-A-G-E-196
  VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
The next step is to have each member of the class talk with 
ten or more grown people to find out their opinions on why one 
should have an education. This information should be listed, 
so that parts can be read. Almost the same outline that was 
used for the former exercise can be used for this. Have the 
pupils add at the end of the paper their own opinions after 
talking with these people. 
EXERCISE XII 
THE FUTURE OF THE PUPIL 
It is not the purpose in this grade to compel pupils to choose 
a future for themselves, but to urge them, if they have no idea 
in mind, to imagine one. The effect of securing serious thought 
upon the subject is sufficient. They should know the educational 
requirements and a few characteristics of the work they think 
of doing. If they tell what they would like to do after leaving 
school, such subjects as the following can be assigned them:

AN EXPERIENCE 
I know a girl, of whom my father is the guardian, who left 
school after graduating from the eighth grade. 
She is an orphan. There was a small amount of money left 
to divide between her small brother and herself. She wanted to 
go through high school, but there was not money enough to put 
her through and take care of her small brother. So, with the 
consent of Probate Judge Higbee and my father, she obtained 
a position in one of the leading department stores of this city as 
cash girl. 
She was not at all satisfied with her position, and knowing 
that her chance for promotion would be poor, she started to 
attend night school. 
Since that time she has been promoted several times and at 
present is in the office of that store. I do not know the name 
of her position, but she checks all sales as they are sent in. 
Everybody speaks highly of her. 
She never could have been promoted so rapidly if she had 
not studied further than the eighth grade, as those who stop 
study at that time have very poor chance to gain any real good 
position. Instead of being through school at that time, we have 
really just begun our education. 
This girl was very anxious to go through high school, and 
would not have left school if it had not been necessary. As it 
is now, she is self-supporting, has some of her money still left 
in the bank, and is going to help her brother when his money 
is gone, and she still continues to study.

    I have always liked to build and work out plans of automo- 
biles and model aéroplanes and such things. I began very young 
to have a desire for this work. About the first thing I liked to 
do was to pound nails, but this did not satisfy me long, for I 
wanted to make things such as I had seen men make. 
I have often envied great men like Thomas Edison and Fulton 
and have wished I could invent some new device that would 
help. mankind. 
I always like to do my work to the best of my ability, but it 
is sometimes hard to get everything just right and it takes a 
great deal of patience. When I am building anything I usually 
have it on my mind most of the time. Sometimes I lie in bed 
planning something and can hardly go to sleep. 
Last term a few weeks before our summer vacation I began 
to plan an automobile which I intended to build during my vaca- 
tion. I formed a picture of it in my mind and began work on 
it after school nights, because I was very anxious to complete it. 
The first part of the work was to make the frame, which took 
a long time and great patience. After I had completed the frame 
I put in the electric wiring. I put all the switches on the dash- 
board so that they would be within reach, making it very handy 
to turn the lights off and on. When this was finished, I covered 
it with the tin I had bought for it, put on the finishing touches, 
and had it out the Fourth of July. 
I think I have special ability along this line because I like to 
draw plans and construct things while others are playing football 
and other games. 
As far as I know now, I like mechanical work well enough to 
make it the basis of my life work. I am now taking mechanical 
drawing and I expect to take up the course in high school that 
will prepare me for an engineering course in college. I think 
that I shall succeed in this work, because I cannot imagine 
myself doing anything else.

TEACHING VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 
Wuat I Founp To ADMIRE IN FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE 
By a GIRL 
Florence Nightingale was cheerful, sympathetic, persevering, 
energetic, and sweet. 
Even when she was a small child she showed an extraordina- 
rily cheerful disposition. Often feeble old ladies, living near her 
home, and suffering with rheumatism, would ask for Florence. 
She always came with a basket full of tempting dishes. She 
would stay with them, always speaking cheerfully, until their 
pain had apparently left them. At the Barrack Hospital, also, 
her cheerfulness did a great deal for the soldiers, as well as for 
her assistants. Every night as she passed through the rooms, 
with her lamp in her hand, to see if all was well for the night, 
she would speak a word of cheer to each soldier who had not 
yet found sleep. 
She showed her sympathy clearly in these instances. While 
riding through the country one day she came to a sad shepherd 
whose dog had been very much hurt. She did not merely tell 
the shepherd that she felt sorry for him, but set about to help 
the dog. Dressing and tending the wound with the utmost care 
each day, he was soon able to watch the sheep again with his 
delighted and grateful master. After a soldier’s death in the 
hospital, she would write home to his people letters full of sym- 
pathy and comfort. Often the people were strengthened by these 
letters, which were treasured very highly. 
Miss Nightingale showed perseverance in many instances. 
When she arrived for the first time at Scutari, and saw the awful 
conditions there, — how the supplies were not brought up to the 
hospital, and how the men were suffering and dying for the want 
of them, — she did not give up in despair, but put herself to the 
great task, and procured them. At the time when she was visit- 
ing the hospitals of the French during the war, and became ill 
from overwork, she still was persevering. Having regained her 
health, she again, against the wishes of her physician, set about 
doing the work she loved. 
[191]

  VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
Florence Nightingale was extremely energetic. After her re- 
turn from the war she was confined to her room for the rest of 
her life ; but then she wrote plans about how she desired to have 
the hospital managed, which had been given her by all the Eng- 
lish people for her devoted service. She also wrote some very 
interesting books during this period about the war. 
Another characteristic is her modesty and sweetness, for which 
all those soldiers loved her. In England every one was at her 
command. She was not commanding, but everything she said 
was said in such a sweet way that no one could refuse her. For 
example, the supplies were all in the ware-houses, instead of in 
the hospital where they were needed. She went to one man and 
asked him to unlock the ware-houses and bring up the supplies. 
He said he would not be permitted to do so unless a certain man 
gave him permission. She then looked up this man, who gave 
numerous excuses, but he found, as all others did sooner or later, 
that Miss Nightingale could not be refused. The ware-houses 
were opened and the supplies taken to the hospital. Before her 
arrival the orderlies were indignant at having a lady come and 
manage things, but all unaware they soon found themselves eager 
to do anything for the lady with “ the soft gray eyes.”

CONTRIBUTION II 
THE ESSENTIALS OF CHARACTER THAT MAKE 
FOR SUCCESS IN LIFE 
By Martua E. Cray 
The second step in vocational guidance in the High 
School is the study of the life of some great character. ) 
The purpose of this study is/pot to impress upon the 
pupils the dates of the great man’s birth or death, or even 
his greatest chive rather to bring out the 
character which made such~achievements possible, the 
traits leading to success which the student himself may 
cultivate. In every great character certain traits are inva- 
riably found. These may be summed up as follows C he 
man, great in character and achievement, has an active 
purpose in life ; a memory which keeps the purpose stead- 
ily before him; a high regard for truth. Besides, he can 
be depended upon to show initiative in accomplishing his 
purpose, i: 
To bring out the full value of these traits to the stu- 
dents, five lessons were given while they were reading the 
life of the great man or woman they had chosen — lessons 
on Purpose, Memory, Truth or Dependableness, Initiative, 
and Success. Before each lesson a story was told to illus- 
trate the characteristic. The power of a strong purpose 
may be brought out by the story of the conversion of Saul, 
[193 ]

VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
the life of Grant before the Civil War contrasted with his 
life as a general, the early struggles of the Wright brothers, 
Livingstone’s return to Africa, the endurance of Peary, or 
the early life of some business man in the pupil’s own city. 
Before the lesson on Memory, the story of Jean Valjean’s 
forgiveness by the bishop was told and the effect that the 
memory of that kindness had upon his life was brought 
out. The other side, the weakness that comes from for- 
getting one’s highest aims, may be brought out in the life 
of Christopher Marlowe, or in the denial of Peter. This 
method was also used before the lesson on Truth, when 
the story of the Mississippi Bubble or the life of De Lesseps 
was told to demonstrate the value of business honor. To 
precede the lesson on Initiative the ““ Message to Garcia” 
is very effective. The last lesson, on Success, may be 
illustrated by the story of Joseph, Father Damien, or Sir 
Walter Scott. : 
After hearing the story, the pupils wrote in class answers 
to five or six questions on the subject under consideration. 
These were corrected in class and copied outside for the 
next day’s lesson. After the teacher had read them over, 
some of the best were read in class, and also some that 
showed hazy ideas, which were cleared up by class discussion. 
After this course the pupil was able to give a character 
sketch of the person whom he had been studying, to dis- 
tinguish the important from the trivial. We can hope too 
that his own character received an uplift, that he learned 
to support his aim in life by the memory of others who 
have had setbacks and struggles like his own, and who 
have yet succeeded. 
Below are questions which suggest the type used.

SUCCESS 
I do not believe that success always means happiness, because 
great people are not always happy. Jane Addams is not partic- 
ularly happy, because she sees the hard part of life. Lincoln was 
not happy, because of the strife between North and South which 
caused thousands of deaths. Success usually means contentment, 
because a successful person is contented by knowing he did his 
best to help the world. Christ was contented to know He did 
His best to improve mankind. The best test of success lies in 
the knowledge that one has been of service to his city or country. 
One must have truth, a purpose, dependableness, and faith to 
succeed. These things made Lincoln rise from a poor boy to the 
presidency of the United States. Four people whose characters 
were successful were Plato, Pericles, Aristides, and Charlemagne. 
Some who were unsuccessful were Themistocles, Henry IV, and 
Robespierre. Purpose, truth, memory, and dependableness are 
the four main roads to success, 
Breinc DEPENDABLE 
I think that a good memory helps us to be dependable in that 
we can be trusted to do a thing if people know that we can re- 
member well. For instance, if a mother wants her boy to go to 
the store and he has just time to get there before it closes, she 
will not want to take time to write the articles she wants, but 
the boy must remember. If he remembers everything, she will 
depend upon him again probably for something larger. 
We ought to keep our word just for the sake of our honor 
and for the sake of doing right. The person who will not keep 
his word when he will suffer a little inconvenience by doing so, 
will keep on breaking his word to avoid small inconveniences | 
until he will have no respect for the truth at all. The harm of 
breaking our word is the losing of our honor and the respect of 
other people. Breaking our word makes us feel, or ought to, 
[196] 
 
-P-A-G-E-205
  THE ESSENTIALS OF CHARACTER 
like the dog who comes sneaking up to his master’s feet after he 
has done something which he knows is wrong. If we promise 
something, we should fulfill it, and not just a part of it. For in- 
stance, if a boy promised his father to quit smoking and going 
down town nights, and did stop going down town nights, but in 
a few days began smoking, I think he would have very little will 
power and self-control, which he needs so much. 
A dependable person when attending a party always takes 
part in helping with the entertainment if he can. He will always 
either accept or decline an invitation for a party very soon after 
he receives the invitation, so as not to keep the host or hostess 
wondering how many to provide for. A dependable person in a 
class always has his work in on time, takes part in discussions, 
and does not try to see how little he can do and still pass his 
work, A dependable person working for someone else will be 
courteous to his employer and the customers, will work hard, and, 
like the dependable schoolboy, will not try to see how little he 
can accomplish and still hold his job. 
The world surely needs dependable people. Anyone who 
starts out in life with the intention of being dependable arid 
honest, and lives up to his intentions, will surely succeed. He 
may not become wealthy, but there are many better ways to 
succeed than that,

CONTRIBUTION III 
THE WORLD’S WORK—A STUDY OF VOCATIONS 
By Anna E. WorKMAN : 
The purpose of the vocational work during the first half 
of the second year is to become acquainted with the world’s 
work, The average high-school boy or girl knows little of 
the world’s industries, other than the one that his parents 
are connected with and those that the city boasts of. The 
aim this semester is entirely informational. We make no 
reference to the student’s future ambition, other than to 
note the part it plays among the world’s great enterprises. 
P= first aim is to create a desire among the students 
to\know something of the vast field of occupations, )We 
begin by speaking of the world our grandfathers and great- 
grandfathers knew. We recall the trades they learned, and 
the enterprises they were interested in. We refer to the 
great home industries — the spinning, the candle making, 
the shoe repairing, and the like, that are now the business 
of large factories. We turn from this picture to that of 
to-day — the hum of manufacturing industries, the hurry 
of great city traffic, and the complications of commercial ° 
activity. We consider the professions —the number of 
men and women who are lawyers, doctors, teachers, and 
nurses. We then ask, “‘ How many vocations do you sup- 
pose there are in the world to-day?” The class, now 
[ 198 ]
-P-A-G-E-207
THE WORLD’S WORK —A STUDY OF VOCATIONS 
interested, will guess, but come far short of the truth. 
They are then told that while there are only twenty-two 
“standard” professions (and it is largely with these that 
they are familiar), there are nearly four thousand occupa- 
tions open to men, and that according to the latest U.S. 
census report only four of these—that of the chimney- 
sweeper, the roofer, the lineman, and the man who serves 
in the U.S. Navy —are not now open to women as well, 
The next step is to ask the class to take pencil and paper, 
and, without preparation, to list as many of the world’s 
occupations — desirable and undesirable — as they possibly 
can. When they find that a possible forty or fifty is the 
extent of their knowledge, they realize that they have 
‘something to learn of the ‘‘ world’s work.” 
We then make our first assignment. We ask the student 
to look around him to find where it is possible to learn of 
other occupations. He readily sees that the telephone and 
city directories are the nearest at hand. He then becomes 
acquainted with business directories, such as Bradstreet’s, 
that may be used for this purpose, and is told that voca- 
tional bureaus at Boston and elsewhere publish helpful 
pamphlets. There are magazines also, such as The Satur- 
day Evening Post and Popular Mechanics, that aim to give 
some information in this line. 
Che next step is to set the student to listing vocations,) 
We attempt a classification for the sake of convenience, 
using some such grouping as the following: (1) professional 
and semiprofessional; (2) the manufacturing and mechani- 
cal industries ; (3) the commercial activities — wholesale 
and retail ; (4) the agricultural pursuits — including horti- 
culture, floriculture, and stock raising ; (5) transportation, 
[ 199 ]
-P-A-G-E-208
VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
by land and water; (6) the field of civil and political 
service; (7) the field of art— music, painting, etc. ; 
(8) domestic and personal service, including agencies and 
office work ; (9) building and constructing ; (10) vocations 
open to women in Grand Rapids; (11) the unclassified 
industries, such as fishing. One classification is assigned 
to each student. His task is merely to list vocations under: 
the head assigned him. We add the interest of competition 
by seeing, first, who can find the greatest number of occu- 
pations ; and second, which pupil, of those working with 
any given classification, can find the greatest number in 
his class. If we have more than one section doing this 
grade of work, they compete to see which can find the 
greatest number. A week or more is given for the contest 
while regular work is continued in the class. We keep 
up interest by speaking of the contest each day and making 
note of how we are progressing. When the contest is 
closed, the best lists are read to the class, one list each 
day. The class attempts to perfect each list as read. Of 
course, some occupations will be found on more than one 
list, as they smack of each classification, but this is avoided 
as far as possible. It will be found that the students are 
much interested in these lists and continually ask what 
is meant by this and that “job.” 
t is our next business to consider why it is good for 
us to know that so many occupations exist, and how the 
knowledge may benefit us. We see that some vocations 
are to be avoided, because they do not serve the world, 
and — what is perhaps of more importance to the student 
—that there must be one among these that he can do 
better than any other, and that it is to his interest to find 
[ 200 ]
-P-A-G-E-209
  THE WORLD’S WORK—A STUDY OF VOCATIONS 
this one. The only way we can find out which of these 
should be our profession — which will be best for us to 
follow —is, first, by learning the requirements of this work; 
and second, by finding out if we have these requirements) 
The work of this semester deals only with the first. We 
now come to appreciate that we really know little about 
any occupation except that followed by our fathers or kins- 
men. In olden times, the boy was expected to follow his 
father’s occupation. Many parents still expect this. Such 
an essay as the following may be valuable at this point: 
“The Good and Bad Points in following my Father's 
Occupation.” The boy will often see that he has not a 
natural aptitude for his father’s business, or that if he has, 
there is danger of failure in it for him, because of the 
temptation to rest on his father’s laurels. Thus the boy 
that wishes to follow his father is timely warned that his 
success is for himself to achieve in any occupation. His 
father can do no more for him than guide and teach him 
at the beginning. 
Our next business is to become acquainted with the most 
important of these numerous occupations. The student is 
asked to write out the names of his first, second, and third 
choices. Either he is honest and chooses the one he be- 
lieves he would care to follow, or he is lazy and chooses 
the one that spells the least work for him. In either case, 
his end is defeated. Our purpose, it will be remembered, 
is to become acquainted with the world’s work. The essay 
he is to write is to be a matter of information for himself 
as well as the class. The thing he is interested in is ordi- 
narily the thing he knows about, and our business is to 
teach him something he does not know. Therefore, he 
[ 201 ]
-P-A-G-E-210
  VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
is assigned quite another topic from his choice. The 
opportunity to study his choice will be given him the fol- 
lowing semester. This fact is explained to him, and the 
purpose of the essay carefully pointed out. He has the 
responsibility of presenting a true and unprejudiced picture 
of a certain occupation. He becomes the vocational teacher 
in this field. 
It is in making these arbitrary assignments that the skill 
of the teacher must be brought into play. It is not her 
business to assign something quite foreign to his tastes 
and ambitions. She is to give him an insight into the 
larger things. At the same time she is to turn his atten- 
tion to the special opportunities of to-day. She must study 
the individual, and attempt to assign a topic which will 
interest and benefit him. The new and growing industries 
— scientific farming, forestry, landscape architecture, and 
the automobile industry — should be presented, rather than 
the generally familiar ones; at the same time, the indus- 
tries peculiar to the home town or city must not be for- 
gotten. For the girls, the arts of the household must not 
be overlooked. There will always be the semirich girl 
who is ‘‘not going to do anything.” Here is the oppor- 
tunity to convince her of the curse to society of useless 
womanhood. She is told to find out from her mother 
some of the things that the home maker must know. Be- 
sides the sewing, the scientific cooking, and the manage- 
ment of the family pocketbook, there are the problems 
of sanitation and the artistic arrangement of the home. 
There must be something said of the opportunity the well- 
to-do woman has to serve the community in which she lives. 
The girl must see that while “society” may be her “play,” 
[ 202 ]
-P-A-G-E-211
THE WORLD’S WORK—A STUDY OF VOCATIONS 
she must have a “‘work” in the world. There will be also 
the boy whose father says he does not need to know these 
things now, for he is not going to be “anything for years 
and years.” Such a boy needs to be convinced that, if he 
wants to avoid missing some of the larger opportunities of 
life, it is not too soon to begin his investigation. But the 
majority of our boys and girls are taught in the home the 
dignity of labor. 
The “term essay’’ is then assigned. In preparation, 
certain books and articles are required to be read on each 
topic. The student must do a sufficient amount of reading 
to ‘‘get into the subject,” and a sufficient amount of think- 
ing to “ get the subject into him.” He is required to keep 
a bibliography of all the material he has found useful to 
him, and is privileged to use that left by the students gone 
before. 
After he has learned all he can about the subject, he 
is then —and not until then —asked to talk with some 
successful man or woman in the occupation. He must go 
with certain definite questions in mind. If there is no 
one in town to whom he may go, a courteous letter will 
bring a reply. He learns that the really successful man 
or woman always has time for him. Indeed, the very 
secret of that success lies in the fact that he has time to 
give as well as to get. 
The compositions are read in class, and questions an- 
swered concerning them. Added information is gathered 
from those who think they know. Each student presents 
a different subject, and one paper is presented each day 
before the regular English work is taken up. With these 
papers we close our vocational work of this semester.

SAMPLE EXERCISE BY A TENTH-GRADE STUDENT 
‘TRAINED NURSING 
The vocation of trained nursing appears to an outsider to be a 
very pleasing occupation, one that does not require a great deal 
of hard work and one that pays well. The neat, trim uniform is 
particularly attractive and becoming. I was very much surprised 
[ 204 ]
-P-A-G-E-213
THE WORLD’S WORK—A STUDY OF VOCATIONS 
when I found out what the term included, and after I had talked 
with certain nurses in the profession, my first impression was 
changed. 
The term “ nurse” includes a great deal. As far as I have 
been able to find out, there are about ten or twelve different 
kinds ; hospital nurses, private nurses, matrons and superintend- 
ents of hospitals, head nurses, surgical nurses, district nurses, and 
Red Cross nurses. 
Formerly, nursing was done by members of the family or 
neighbors who hastened to assist in time of trouble, or by those 
people who, having more or less ability in caring for the sick, 
practised the art with such knowledge as they had been able to 
pick up or had gained through personal experience. To-day, how- 
ever, nursing means an intelligent care of the sick by those who 
have received special and scientific training for their work. 
Florence Nightingale is one of the most noted of nurses. She 
revolutionized army nursing. She was born May 15, 1820. She 
early became interested in hospital work, examined various hos- 
pitals throughout Europe, and was trained as a nurse by the 
Protestant Sisters of Mercy at Kaiserswerth-on-the-Rhine. In 
1854 she went to the Crimea, having organized a band of trained 
nurses in a week, and established the great hospital at Scutari, 
where she showed rare gifts of organization and heroism. Her 
health failed suddenly because of her severe efforts, but she 
refused to accept for herself the subscription of fifty thousand 
pounds raised for her, preferring to use it for the foundation of 
the Nightingale Home at Saint Thomas’s Hospital. 
Clara Barton is another trained nurse of whom the world may 
be proud. She was born at Oxford, Massachusetts, in 1830. 
She founded a free school in New Jersey, afterwards becoming 
anurse. She nursed and superintended a great part of the work 
in the Civil War, the Franco-Prussian, the Cuban and Spanish 
wars, besides being at the head of the flood relief work and the 
Russian famine. When the Red Cross Society was started in 
the United States in 1881, Miss Barton was elected the first presi- 
dent and remained in that office until 1904, when she resigned.

  VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
The field for nursing has grown rapidly, especially within the 
last few years. New opportunities are opening for nurses in con- 
nection with social service, and since this work is a growing one, 
such opportunities will increase. Some of the special lines of 
work are the following : 
1. District nursing. Nurses are engaged by a District Nurs- 
ing Association, whose fund comes from private contributions. 
These nurses are employed to care for poor sick people, who 
are not able to pay, and for those who have very little means 
and can pay only a little. 
2. Nurses at milk stations. There are about ten of these 
stations ‘in the city of Boston. At these stations nurses go out 
to tend to the proper feeding of babies and to instruct the 
mothers. These nurses receive a good salary. 
3. Wurses in tuberculosis work. These nurses go out from 
the hospitals in the larger cities and visit the homes in which 
there is a tubercular patient, and give care and instructions. 
4. School nurses. The school nurses visit homes in which the 
pupils are ill, and they report to the schools. They also give in- 
structions and care, if needed. Besides this, at appointed times 
during the year, they examine the schools for diseases. 
In all these cases, living expenses must be paid from the 
nurse’s salary. At present about one hundred nurses hold posi- 
tions such as the four just described in the city of Boston alone. 
Besides all these positions in social-service work, there is a great 
field for private nursing and for hospital nursing. There is also 
the Red Cross Association, which has about three thousand 
nurses that may be called upon to serve in time of need. Not 
only in this city but in many others the practical nurse has a 
large field, a practical nurse being one who has received a home 
training or only part of a hospital training. Many people prefer 
practical nurses, and of course their services are less expensive. 
The field in Grand Rapids is very large for a city of this size. 
At present there are about one hundred fifty nurses registered 
in “ The Nurses Central Directory ” ; but even this number can- 
not supply the need of this city. You see that there is one nurse 
[ 206 ]
-P-A-G-E-215
THE WORLD’S WORK—A STUDY OF VOCATIONS 
to about eight hundred people. In epidemics very often one finds 
it almost impossible to secure a good nurse. If all the nurses 
that graduate from our hospitals would stay in this city, the de- 
mand would be more than filled, but as about one half of the 
graduates leave the city, there is always a call for more. 
The qualifications necessary to become a nurse are very ex- 
acting. A girl who plans to become a nurse should have sound 
health, a great power of endurance, and a good physique with 
an appearance of good health, including good skin and teeth, 
perfect hearing, and good eyesight. She should be a person who 
does not need an unusual amount of sleep, for in nursing one 
must often work with very little sleep. She should have a good 
supply of patience, tact, good nature, intelligence, and common 
sense, and she should be resourceful so that in any emergency 
she will be able to act wisely. She should be teachable, and able 
to give close attention to rules ; she should be always willing, and 
have a certain dignity and refinement of person, quiet, pleasing 
manners, and a neat and attractive appearance. Most of all she 
should have a real love for her work, and have high ideals in re- 
gard to it. It is usually required that a girl be twenty-one years 
old to enter a training school. Some schools, however, admit 
girls at eighteen or nineteen. In nearly all schools, a high-school 
training is required. Girl graduates from our schools in this city 
take the “ Florence Nightingale Pledge” upon entering a nurses’ 
training school. It is as follows: 
I solemnly pledge myself before God, and in the presence of this 
assembly, to pass my life in purity and to practice my profession 
faithfully. I will abstain from whatever is mischievous, and will not 
take or knowingly administer any harmful drug. I will do all in my 
power to maintain and elevate the standard of my profession, and will 
hold in confidence any personal matters committed to my keeping and 
all family affairs coming to my knowledge in the practice of my call- 
ing. With loyalty will I endeavor to aid the physician in his work, 
and devote myself to the welfare of those committed to my care.   Nursing is a profession that pays well— in almost all cases, 
very well. As a private nurse, one receives from $20 to $25 
[ 207 ]
-P-A-G-E-216
  
VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
a week, besides board, lodging, and laundry work. Head nurses 
in hospitals receive from $30 to $45 a month, besides living 
expenses. Matrons and superintendents receive much more, 
as they are persons of experience. District nurses receive a 
good salary, and nurses at milk stations receive from $60 to 
$75 a month, Nurses in tuberculosis work get $75 a month. 
School nurses get a yearly salary of from $700 to $800. In these 
last cases living expenses must be paid from the salary. A prac- 
tical nurse gets from $10 to $15 a week, which is a very good 
salary. Red Cross nurses of course receive only a small salary, 
as theirs is charitable work. 
The personal satisfaction gained in nursing is perhaps greater 
than in any other vocation. he joy of doing for others and 
helping humanity is great} When a nurse stops to think of the 
lives that are being saved every day by the nurses of the country, 
and of the fact that she has her small part in the great work, she 
feels fully repaid for the hard, exacting work through which she 
has passed and is passing. The burden of suffering is eased by 
the nurses as much as, if not more than, by any other persons 
in the world. Many sacrifice their whole lives for their work, 
and the number of lives saved is very great. 
In all vocations there are the favorable and unfavorable points. 
Nursing makes a girl equal to emergencies and in a way a more 
useful, self-controlled woman. Her personal satisfaction in her 
service to the world fully repays her for the sacrifice she makes 
in performing many disagreeable tasks. Perhaps one of the most 
unfavorable points in nursing is the long and irregular hours. 
She may be called on at any time of night or day. A private 
nurse cannot count on steady employment. Hospital nurses have 
very little time to themselves. It is very tedious to be on one’s 
feet so much, almost day and night, and only very strong girls 
are able to do it. So anyone taking nursing as a vocation should 
not decide hastily. There are many things to be taken into con- 
sideration, and only a girl with health, character, and a great love 
for her work is able to succeed.

CHOOSING A VOCATION 
By Mary E. Murpruy 
In the second semester of the tenth grade, as has been 
shown in the text, the pupil makes, if possible, a choice 
of his life work. He discovers, by reading and by con- 
ference with those who are fitted to inform him, what 
qualifications are necessary to success in the occupation 
for which he has a liking, and then studies himself with 
a view to ascertaining, if he can, whether or not he pos- 
sesses any or all of these essentials. To aid in this study, 
a detailed guestionnaire may be given him, the careful 
answering of which will necessitate a self-examination as 
to tastes, natural ability, and ambitions. The answers will 
be of great help to the teacher in assigning later work on 
a definite occupation, and introspection to this extent need 
not be harmful to the pupil. In connection with this 
study, the pupil tries to find out how much he has been 
influenced by other people, and whether this influence has 
been a wise one; how much, and in what ways, he has 
shown, in or out of school, that he has any ability in the 
direction of a definite occupation. He writes many short 
papers on subjects along this line, does ample reading in 
books suggested by the teacher, and also— and this is a 
very important source of help — interviews those people 
[ 209 ]

VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
who have achieved success in his chosen work, and who, 
consequently, can answer the many questions which fill 
his mind. Finally, all of the material obtained in these 
different ways is combined in a well-organized exposition 
on the chosen work, accompanied by an outline. 
In the Grand Rapids Central High School, the work 
of this semester is largely composition work. Everything 
taken up is studied primarily to perfect the pupil’s mode 
of expression. Here, where a variety of topics is needed 
which interest the pupil and draw the best from him, the 
work in vocational guidance furnishes excellent subjects, 
for it is practical and definite, besides offering many and 
various sources of material, and demanding some study 
and reading. 
Before the long paper is written, a gradual preparation 
should be made. Since the first drill in composition in 
this grade is in paragraph development, valuable sug- 
gestions for personal study helpful to the later work of 
actual choice of a vocation can here be made. Paragraph 
development by detail, example, comparison, contrast, etc. 
can be very well taught by assigning subjects which lend 
themselves admirably to the particular lesson, and which, 
at the same time, lay the foundation for the more inten- 
sive and extensive study in the long essay. The following 
topic sentences for paragraphs developed by the various 
methods studied in the ten-two grade have been found 
helpful : 
. My favorite work is —. 
. Mathematics (or any subject) is my favorite study. 
. My hobby is —. 
. Responsibility should be developed early.

5. Life on a farm helps to develop a boy’s responsibility. 
6. Engineering requires a thorough knowledge of mathematics. 
7. My greatest ambition is —. 
8. ——(an occupation) is unlike —— (another occupation) in nearly 
all respects. 
The last topic, or a similar one, employs the method of 
contrast. These subjects are of interest to the pupil, and 
are suggestive of further study which he may give voca- 
tions in general and his own life work in particular. 
Longer papers are. of course needed in the ten-two 
theme work, and here, again, the subjects of vocational 
interest are valuable for the reasons already stated. The 
following topics may be written on the board and freely 
discussed by the class, after which each pupil may select 
one for his own three-to-four-page theme : 
. How to avoid “' blind-alley ” jobs. 
. Why I prefer the “ open-door vocation.” 
. The value of deciding early upon a vocation. 
. How I happened to choose —~ as my vocation. 
. The story of —— (some relative or friend who succeeded in his 
chosen work). 
6, Why I think I have ability to succeed as —. Mbwnd a 
On the day these themes are brought to the class they may 
be read aloud and the subjects again discussed, for the 
pupils are interested in them. The day upon which these 
themes are reported may be set apart as a “club” day, 
with one of the pupils chosen by the class to preside over 
the session. Such a plan will often stimulate freer discus- 
sion than that which is usually obtained by the more formal 
classroom methods. 
A theme which is the result of this kind of assignment 
is given here. 
[211]

VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
SAMPLE EXERCISE BY A TENTH-GRADE STUDENT 
THE VALUE OF MY VOCATION TO THE COMMUNITY 
I have taken a great deal of time and thought in deciding 
upon the line of work which would be best for me to follow. 
There seemed to me to be three points which should be con- 
sidered by young people deciding upon their vocation in life. 
These three are equal in importance. oe no one can hope 
to be successful in work which is distastéful to him. Secondly, 
people are qualified along certain lines and have ability for a 
certain kind of work; therefore, it is very necessary that your 
ability should be closely studied in connection with your voca- 
tion. Thirdly, and most important, the question is, What is the 
value of my vocation to the community 
I consider the vocation which I havé chosen, namely, that of 
teaching household arts, to be very useful to the community as 
a whole. Few people fully realize all which the term household 
arts implies. Owing to the frequent misuse of the term, many 
recognize the science of cooking as the single study included in 
this course. But this is not true in fact, as the term includes 
sewing, millinery, textile work, and all domestic arts. 
In every direction in which I look I see the need of domes- 
tic science. Our growing girls in this generation must have 
some training in domestic work, for every girl will be in need 
of it some time in her life. And in nine cases out of ten the 
young girls of this age are not getting this training, owing to 
various reasons. In many cases the mothers are too much in- 
terested in social events to give their daughters the proper 
amount of training in cooking. The girls of these homes can- 
not possibly learn the domestic arts in their homes; therefore, 
there must be some preparation made for them to obtain that 
training otherwise than at home. 
A girl friend of mine has this condition to contend with. 
She has many times expressed her desire to learn to cook, but 
her mother evidently thinks it not necessary that the daughter 
be taught household arts. Another girl of my acquaintance is 
[212] 
 
-P-A-G-E-221
  CHOOSING A VOCATION 
the only child in the family. She and her parents board. How 
is she to learn about domestic work? Consider also the many 
poorer families where the mother works during the day, per- 
haps in some factory, and cannot have the patience to teach 
her daughter after a day of labor. Then there are the very 
poor districts, some foreign and some American, where the 
mothers have no knowledge of preparing a good wholesome 
American meal. How are the girls of these families to learn 
the art of cooking under such circumstances ? 
These are only a few of the many cases which show clearly 
the great need of teachers of domestic science and the install- 
ment of this work in the public schools; for if these girls can- 
not obtain training of this kind in the homes, they must be able 
to obtain it elsewhere. The educators. have discovered this, 
and most schools are equipped for the teaching of domestic 
science; therefore, the demand for teachers in this line of 
work is increasing. So I believe my chosen vocation to be of 
great value to the community. 
These themes and all of the outlines, paragraphs, and 
short papers are handed back to the pupil to be kept in 
his notebook, so that any of the material which will assist 
in the writing of the long exposition can later be used. 
The preparation for the long paper itself can be broken 
up into separate lessons, the results of which are finally 
organized into a single paper. One lesson is a report 
from Parson’s “Choosing a Vocation” on the qualifica- 
tions necessary to success in any line of work, and in the 
chosen occupation particularly. This may be made orally 
or written in paragraph form. Another, and an excellent 
lesson, is the report of an interview with a person success- 
ful in the vocation. 
Before interviewing anyone, the pupil, under the direc- 
tion of the teacher, should formulate questions which he 
[213]
-P-A-G-E-222
  VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
wishes to have answered. For example, a girl who is 
planning to be a journalist interviewed the city editor on 
one of the leading newspapers. From him she obtained 
information concerning the characteristics a woman jour- 
nalist should possess, the training required, the kind and 
variety of the work, and the extent of the field open to 
women. The informal conversation made clear to her 
definite facts of practical value concerning salary, advan- 
tages and hardships in journalism, the chances for ad- 
vancement, the amount of personal satisfaction to be 
found, and the tendency toward specialization in the work, 
such as feature writing ; and it gave her, besides, a fund 
of interesting information which made the subject a live 
one for her. She, in turn, enlivened it for the class in an 
excellent oral report made only from notes. From this 
lesson, she learned three important things: how to ap- 
proach a busy man courteously and intelligently so as to 
gain information on his favorite subject ; how to organize 
the material thus obtained ; and finally, how to present it 
orally with directness and interest. Every member of the 
class, besides, gained a new item of information. 
In the meantime, while shorter papers are being written 
and interviews gained, assigned reading is being done by 
the pupil along the line of the work he intends to choose 
for his own. Lists of books found in the public and school 
libraries are posted, and in every case where it is possible 
the teacher directs the reading, aiding the pupils in making 
notes as to points they particularly wish to find. When the 
exposition is later written, a careful bibliography is appended. 
It is now time to organize the material for the longer 
paper in a logical outline, and on this rather difficult task 
[ 214]
-P-A-G-E-223
  CHOOSING A VOCATION 
several days may be profitably spent. Even after the 
proper division is made, with the subtopics in their cor- 
rect relation, there is still the question of order with a view 
to proportion and climax. Then some hints as to the 
transition should be given, and finally the pupil should be 
set to writing his essay, not a really difficult task when a 
careful outline is followed. 
This gradual development of the long paper, entitled 
““My Vocation,” insures many things. The pupil is inter- 
ested in each phase of the subject and takes time to think 
it over; he learns that a long essay on an intensive topic 
needs careful preparation; he is taught how to organize 
his material in constructing his own outline; and he is 
not so apt to take wholesale slices out of a‘book as he is 
when he writes just one long essay as the result of a 
sudden effort. 
Teachers who have approached the work in vocational 
guidance in this or some similar way will agree that it not 
only benefits the pupil in assisting him in the choice of 
his life work but also helps the English work in furnishing 
definite, practical, and interesting subjects.

BripGE ENGINEERING 
Engineering is the art of constructing roads, bridges, engines, 
buildings, and the like, and of planning and executing such 
works according to the principles of nature. 
Engineering may first be divided into four great divisions — 
military, marine, mechanical, and civil. Military engineering 
deals with the construction and maintenance of. fortifications, 
[215 ]
-P-A-G-E-224
  VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
and the surveying of a country for military operations. Marine, 
or naval, engineering embraces works of a military and partly 
of a naval character. To the marine, or naval, engineer falls the 
construction of the war vessels and the various engines of war, 
such as torpedoes. The mechanical engineer is one who is 
efficient in the invention, contrivance, and adjustment of all kinds 
of machinery. Civil engineering, the most extensive branch of 
the four, deals with the construction and maintenance of bridges, 
roads, highways, urban and interurban railroads, canals, light- 
houses, railroads, the metal framework of large buildings, hydrau- 
lic rams, aqueducts, sewers, and drains. Therefore, as branches 
of civil engineering, we have urban and interurban railroad 
engineering, railroad engineering, constructional engineering, — 
dealing with the construction of canals, lighthouses, and the like, 
—and sanitary engineering, which is the newest branch of civil 
engineering, and which deals with sewerage and drainage prob- 
lems. In this vocational essay I shall deal with bridge engineering, 
one of the many branches of civil engineering. 
The early bridges were not bridges according to the present 
conception of the term. They were simply piles driven into the 
stream and connected by wooden beams on which the floor planks 
were laid. The Pons Sublicius, at Rome, built over the Tiber 
about 650 B.c., was of this simple type. The famous bridge built 
by Ceesar over the Rhine in 55 B.c. was also of this kind of con- 
struction. In 1847 Squire Whipple placed the science of bridge 
building on an exact mathematical basis, such as is used now. 
Previous to this time, bridges were made of wood and built by 
judgment, not from previously computed strains. All parts of a 
bridge were made the same size, and if one piece started to fail 
it was replaced by a larger one, so that many of the bridges at 
this period were very weak as well as very strong. 
After Squire Whipple had placed bridge building on a mathe- 
matical basis, its growth and development were rapid, so that, in 
the memory of our grandfathers, wood was discarded and iron 
and other metals were used in its stead. From then on we have 
the truly modern bridge. 
[216]
-P-A-G-E-225
  CHOOSING A VOCATION 
To-day bridge engineering has perhaps the largest and most 
extensive field of all the professions. Every new year sees hun- 
dreds — yes, thousands — of new bridges spanning great rivers 
or lakes. What great engineer could span the thirteen miles be- 
tween the coast of Florida and the Florida Keys? None—except 
the twentieth-century engineer. What great engineer could span 
the East River in New York City? None, before the nineteenth- 
century engineer. How many rivers of the great United States 
are still unspanned? Thousands! These are the opportunities for 
the bright young bridge engineer. To-day the old wooden trestles 
on the great railroads in the United States are being replaced by 
steel structures. Here alone is enough opportunity for the bridge 
engineers of this generation. One of the professors in a noted 
engineering school at Boston said that the demands were so great 
for graduated bridge engineers that he could not possibly fill 
them all. 
There is. hardly any field for bridge engineering in Grand 
Rapids, for there are no bridge-construction companies here in 
which to get a start; so it is advisable for one to go to some 
large city, such as New York or Boston, where the bridge com- 
panies are numerous. 
In bridge engineering, as in any other profession or industry, 
“honesty is the best policy.” One must also put character into 
his work, as his reputation will follow him through life and per- 
haps after his life. A bridge engineer must have a liking for 
mathematics. He should have a practical knowledge of the fun- 
damental principles of mathematics and know how and when to 
apply them according to the laws of nature. He should have a 
liking for drawing and should be proficient in mechanical drawing 
and know how to read drawings. On this largely depends his 
success. He must know the laws of physics and gravitation, and 
must be a constructor. He should have a practical business 
training, as the bridge engineer is a business man as well as a 
scientific man. The bridge engineer should have rugged health, 
as he is almost always out of doors. He must be alert and quick 
in every situation. He must be a man of action and decision. 
[ 217]
-P-A-G-E-226
  VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
He should be a leader of men, and should have conquered him- 
self ; and he must be reliant and trustworthy at all times. With 
these abilities and characteristics a man can be truly termed a 
bridge engineer. 
It is not necessary, as it was thought to be ten years ago, to 
go to Europe for an engineering course. In our own country the 
young man can be taught bridge engineering as well as, if not 
better than, in any other. The best places to obtain this training 
are in the universities, as the University of Michigan, the Uni- 
versity of Chicago, the Michigan Agricultural College, Yale, 
Harvard, Princeton, and the eastern engineering schools. In 
Boston there is a fine engineering school — the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology. A professor in the Massachusetts Insti- 
tute of Technology states that a man aspiring to be a bridge 
engineer should go through college, as anyone can, for by 
working in the vacation he can go through with one thou- 
sand dollars. This, he says, can be borrowed if need be, and 
paid back as soon as possible. He also says that the student 
should take at least five or six years of college work, after 
which he should hire out to some bridge-construction company 
and there learn the practical side. 
As soon as a man has graduated from college and has a good 
recommendation, he is immediately given a position with some 
company at a salary of from sixty to seventy-five dollars a month. 
‘Two years later, if he has proved his worth, he receives on an 
average from one thousand to fifteen hundred dollars a year. 
And in ten years from graduation he gets from five to six 
thousand dollars a year, or more than the average pay of a 
circuit judge. 
Personal satisfaction is a great factor in success, but service 
to the world is what counts in life. A bridge engineer is person- 
ally satisfied when he can lean back in his chair and view the 
bridges which he has constructed by his own efforts, and which 
he is sure will stand the severe test of time. But he is even more 
pleased with his profession when he thinks that if it had not 
been for him and his predecessors, the railroads which make a 
[ 218 ]
-P-A-G-E-227
CHOOSING A VOCATION 
network through our country could not have been developed, 
and civilization in general would have been retarded. We can all 
see how great was the development of the railroads after Squire 
Whipple put bridge building on a mathematical basis in 1870, 
and when wood was discarded for metal. If it had not been for 
this man, we could not have had the long railroad bridges, and 
those bridges that were up could not have carried the Twentieth 
Century Limited. So bridge engineering in the last century has 
helped develop the world. 
I think that I shall make a success in bridge engineering, be- 
cause ever since I was a little fellow I have drawn bridges and 
have been handy with drawing instruments. When I see a bridge 
I can generally name its style of construction, and when I am 
down at the library I always look up something new about bridge 
engineering and construction. I have always liked mathematics 
and it is easy for me to grasp its principles. After finishing the 
high school I intend to go either to the University of Michigan 
or to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Ever since I 
can remember my father has given me five dollars a month to 
put into the bank for college, so now I have a neat sum which will 
help me through college wonderfully. 
Bridge engineering, as well as any other profession, has favor- 
able and unfavorable aspects. The favorable points for bridge 
engineering are that the man is working for a fine object, and that 
he receives a good compensation, both in money and in personal 
satisfaction, for his brains and hands. Perhaps the most unfavor- 
able ones are: the engineer has many sleepless nights figuring 
out some new plan for the morrow; as he is constructing all 
over the country, he cannot see his relatives and friends for 
weeks and even months at a time; many engineers have never 
known the real meaning of “ vacation ” and of ‘* home.” 
When I am a bridge engineer, I hope to be the leader of some 
great bridge project, such as spanning some great distance of 
water, and in this way to lay my offering at the feet of civilization.

PREPARATION FOR A VOCATION AND 
VOCATIONAL ETHICS 
By Carriz R. Heaton 
After the pupil has studied the world’s work and chosen 
an occupation, the next problem for him, his parents, aad 
his teacher to consider is this : What preparation is needed 
to fit him for work in this particular occupation, and where 
can the best preparation be obtained? The teacher can 
begin the work by assigning for informal discussion in 
the class this topic, “‘ The Value of a College Education.” 
She will always find that her class contains a number of 
pupils who expect to go to college — indeed, their parents 
have planned this college training when the children were 
babies, and it has been accepted as a part of their necessary 
preparation for life. On the other hand, there will be some 
students who expect to go directly from the high school in- 
to business and who think that a college education is not 
necessary for them — in fact, that it would be a handicap. 
They argue that, in the past generation, the most conspic- 
uously successful business men have gone out into the 
world early in life and have learned business methods by 
practical experience. Other students have not yet “found 
themselves”; their ambition has not been aroused, and 
college does not appeal to them. In this exercise the

teacher should aim to present new viewpoints to the last 
two classes of students. She can skillfully direct the dis- 
cussion to bring out the points which she wishes to em- 
phasize and which will appeal to the majority of students ; 
namely, the increased earning capacity of the college-bred 
men and women, their broader knowledge and culture, 
their capacity for greater and higher enjoyments, the 
social prestige that college training gives, the cultivation 
of friendships worth while, the storing up of pleasant 
memories, etc. At the end of the recitation she should 
have all the points for and against a college education 
summarized. Such a discussion is of especial value to the 
students who think that college training would be of no 
value to them. The teacher can then suggest the names 
of books and magazine articles bearing upon this subject 
and can ask students to read along this line. 
The next subjects form excellent material for debates. 
The class can be divided into groups, each group to debate 
one of the following resolutions : 
1. Resolved, That it is better for the average young man or woman 
to attend a college with a small student body than a large institution. 
2. Resolved, That it is better for the young man or woman to 
attend a coeducational college than a separate institution for young - 
men and women. 
3. Resolved, That it is better for a young man brought up in 
the Middle West or East to attend a college situated in another section 
of the country. 
Now the class is ready to make a study of different col- 
leges. Most students have very little knowledge concern- 
ing the curriculum or student life of any college. Asa great 
many students prefer to attend a college near home, it is 
a good plan to begin the study of colleges with those in 
[ 221] 
 
-P-A-G-E-230
  VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
the home state. Assign a college to each student. Boys 
who are planning to work at some particular branch of 
engineering should be asked to look up the institutions 
ranking high in this particular kind of work. Those who 
plan to be scientific farmiers should look up the agricul- 
tural colleges. Students who wish to be architectural de- 
signers are assigned institutions giving good courses in 
that kind of work. Girls who plan to be teachers study 
the normal schools and colleges giving good academic and 
pedagogical training. Others who wish to study some phase 
of art look up art schools, etc. The school library should 
contain catalogues of all the leading educational institutions 
in the United States, and each student should be encour- 
aged to write to the secretary of the colleges he is interested 
in, asking for catalogues for his own use. In the meantime 
students should be encouraged to talk with the graduates 
of the colleges they are studying. These interviews usually 
give more definite information than the college catalogue 
affords. The student must keep in mind, in all this work, 
certain definite points —the courses of study in the col- 
lege, its rank, its size, the necessary expenses, student life, 
entrance requirements, etc. After he has some definite 
knowledge about the colleges and has decided where he 
had better go, he must plan the remainder of his high- 
school course so as to meet the requirements of the college 
he has in mind. It is also impressed upon his mind that 
in order to enter this college, whether by examination or 
by certificate, he must thoroughly master his high-school 
subjects and obtain good standing. This careful planning 
in the eleventh grade often results in saving a half year or 
more of additional high-school work. :

PREPARATION FOR A VOCATION 
Girls coming from homes of wealth usually choose one 
of the leading girls’ colleges. It is worth while for such , 
girls to know the life and aims of these different schools 
so that an intelligent choice may be made. 
The teacher will find that thé selection of the college 
best fitting the needs of the individual student means giv- 
ing much of her time to personal conference. Wholesale 
information concerning colleges can be given in class reci- 
tation, but the needs of individual students entail careful 
study of their particular vocation, their character, and what 
they most need in order to develop well-rounded manhood 
and womanhood. Some students are better off in a college 
with a small student body, because they are brought into 
more intimate contact with instructors and more attention is 
given to their development along all lines. A more mature 
student will be able to do good work in a large university. 
The teacher should make a study of the pupil so that she can 
wisely direct him to the best college or at least start him 
and his parents to thinking on this important subject. 
To the boys who are going directly from the high 
school into business or some occupation that does not 
require college training, the teacher may assign the fol- 
lowing topics for study : 
. How can I prepare myself for my occupation ? 
. Correspondence schools. 
. Short-unit courses in agricultural colleges. 
. Night-school classes. 
Y.M.C.A, evening classes. 
. Business colleges. 
The essentials of business success. 
. Good English as a business asset. 
. The value of courtesy.

ms and aims with some successful business man. Lives of 
successful men and women can also be studied to discover 
the characteristics and qualities that made their oa 
After this study and thought each member of the class 
is ready to embody the results of his investigation in a 
formal essay. It is sometimes advisable to work up in the 
class a suggestive outline, though when this is done, pupils 
may be cautioned that, in considering some colleges, it will 
probably not be best to follow the outline exactly. Some 
entire discussions may be omitted, and a different order is 
often to be preferred. The following outline, developed 
in the class, will show the pupils some of the topics to 
be considered.

The second half of the eleventh-grade work is devoted 
to the study of the ethical problems arising in the various 
occupations chosen by the different pupils of the class. 
The aim of the teaching is distinctly ethical, to instill in 
the minds and hearts of students high ideals and clear 
ideas of right and wrong. The proverb “ Forewarned, 
forearmed” applies with double force here. If the pupil 
knows the moral standards of his chosen vocation, the 
high ideals of honor and integrity which the best men in it 
hold sacred, he is forearmed and is much less liable to yield 
to any temptation to lower that standard and expose himself 
to the contempt of those whose good opinion he values) 
All teachers know that at this time in the high-school 
course pupils have reached a stage of development when 
it is profitable to ask them to think earnestly of the prob- 
lems relating to their everyday conduct as well as to those 
of the future. This work is also a good introduction to 
that of the last year, when they are asked to consider 
their duty to society and the state. 
It is a good plan to begin this work by explaining the 
meaning of the word “ethics ” and illustrating it by refer- 
ence to their daily life. The more practical the illustration 
[225]
-P-A-G-E-234
er eee een : 
{ 
VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
the better. Take cheating in the class or in an examination, 
for example. By taking this topic the teacher not only makes 
clear the meaning of ‘‘ethics” but also dignifies the sub- 
ject used for illustration. She might ask the class to give 
their opinion on such questions as these : 
1, Where and in what ways does cheating usually occur? 
2. Give the reasons why students cheat. 
3. Are any of these reasons valid? 
4. What does cheating lead to? What is its influence upon a 
student’s work? upon his character? Whom does he really cheat ? 
5. What remedies would you propose to stop cheating —the 
honor system, or greater vigilance on the part of teachers? 
Another subject which is worth while for students to con- 
sider as an ethical problem relates to the marring and 
destruction of public property, such as the schoolhouse and 
its equipment. After an informal discussion in the class, 
it will pay to have all the class treat the subject in editorial 
style, making use of the following points :   1. Reference’ to the Vandals’ sack of Rome and enumeration of 
some modern forms of vandalism. 
2. The cost to the public of defacing and destroying public 
property. 
3. Who must ultimately pay the expense? 
4. The proper way for every good citizen to use public property. 
After two or three exercises like the above the teacher 
can go outside the school and suggest topics like these : 
. How to treat clerks. 
. Beating my way on a street car. 
. Picking flowers in the public parks. 
. Breaking the speed limit. 
. Profanity. up

-P-A-G-E-235
    PREPARATION FOR A VOCATION 
We find that pupils are deeply interested in all these sub- 
jects and that such topics are excellent for oral com- 
position. The teacher should bear in mind that these 
subjects have little value ethically unless they are treated 
simply and naturally, with reference to modern life and 
the pupil’s own experience, and the members of the class 
themselves should suggest in the discussion the right 
viewpoint. 
In choosing the first subject for discussion the teacher 
will find that the daily papers have educated the general 
public on the evils of late Christmas shopping, so that point 
may be passed over with brief mention and other points 
discussed. Nearly every class will contain pupils who have 
at'some time clerked on Saturdays. They can be relied 
upon to open the discussion by referring to practices which 
every shopper should consider. They will touch upon the 
discourteous manner of the customer, her impatience at 
having to wait if the store is crowded, the uncomplimen- 
tary comments on the goods displayed, the effort to ‘‘ beat 
down” the price, unnecessary handling of goods easily 
soiled, disarrangement of stock, etc. The reverse of this 
picture, the manner of the clerk towards the customer, is 
also worth painting. The discussion can be closed by the 
teacher’s suggesting the application of the Golden Rule. 
After some of these preliminary lessons on everyday 
conduct we next proceed to the study of the moral prob- 
lems in different occupations. The teacher will find it 
necessary to help the pupil to make the application to his 
chosen vocation. She may ask, ‘‘ What do the best physi- 
cians, the best dentists, the best lawyers, the best farmers 
or fruit growers believe it is right to do or not to do in 
[ 227]
-P-A-G-E-236
  VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
their work ?”” Some boy who is interested in fruit growing 
immediately answers that honorable fruit growers never 
indulge in “topping,” the practice of putting inferior fruit 
in the bottom of the basket and covering it with high- 
grade fruit. Another who plans to be a dentist says that 
the best dentists never make cavities in perfectly sound 
teeth in order to get more work. Other students give 
further illustrations relating to their vocations. The 
teacher can now safely ask all who have made a choice 
of an occupation to write a theme on the ethical problems 
of their vocation. 
As there is very little literature bearing upon the work 
of this grade, the teacher will find it necessary to ask 
pupils to arrange for a personal conference with the high- 
minded men and women of the city who are engaged in 
these vocations. Some may have been employed by per- 
sons in the chosen vocation and can draw upon their own 
observations. After the student has collected his material 
he is asked to make an outline, which, after criticism by 
the teacher, he expands intoa theme. He then either reads 
his theme to the class so that all may get some idea of 
the moral problems of different vocations or he summarizes 
the main points in a five-minute talk to the class. 
We have found that it is comparatively easy for students 
to find material on the ethical problems of some vocations, 
such as journalism, medicine, law, and dentistry. But cer- 
tain kinds of business present perplexing problems, to 
solve which requires more knowledge of economics and 
sociology than the average eleventh-grade boy possesses. 
Boys who are going into business life may be asked to 
write on these subjects : 
[ 228 ]
-P-A-G-E-237
PREPARATION FOR A VOCATION 
. “Business is business.” 
. Get-rich-quick schemes. 
. Good ways to invest money. 
. Advertising. 
. Good English as a business asset. up wn a 
Information on all of these subjects is easily obtained. 
The first subject in the list lends itself readily to different 
forms of literary treatment. One student can explain its 
meaning in an expository theme, another by means of a 
short story (see the Adlantic Monthly for September, 1913), 
while a third can treat it dramatically, either in the form 
of a modern drama or of a morality play. 
Some one may ask, ‘‘ What will the girls of the class 
who expect to stay at home after school days are over do 
for subjects ?”’ They have no chosen vocation aside from 
home making. These girls can be asked to consider sub- 
jects like the following that have a real ethical bearing 
upon women’s lives: 
1. Are women too extravagant? 
2. Explain what is meant by the statement that the French people 
could live on what Americans throw away. 
. How should a mistress treat her maid? 
. Women’s dress. 
. The proper dress for high-school girls. 
. The business woman’s dress. 
What constitutes a bargain ? 
. A fair attitude towards one’s city or community. OY ANU wW 
We have found that a consideration of the question 
of getting bargains is worth while in stimulating thought 
and cultivating the right emotions. The teacher can direct 
the pupils to books and magazine articles bearing on the 
[ 229 ]
-P-A-G-E-238
  VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
““sweat-shop”’ system and bad factory conditions, which 
make possible low prices in ready-made underwear and 
suits. The pupils can then be taught to see that an article 
of any kind, made of poor material and with poor work- 
manship, will not wear and is not cheap at any price. Then 
the conclusion can be drawn that one should be willing to 
pay a fair price for a well-made article of good material, 
that will last a reasonable length of time. The subject 
designated “A fair attitude towards one’s city or com- 
munity” affords an opportunity for the class to consider 
the benefits a citizen receives from the city in which he 
lives, namely, educational facilities, police and fire pro- 
tection, recreational and business benefits, etc. Then the 
question is asked, ‘‘ What return should the individual 
make for all these benefits? Is he making sufficient re- 
turn when he pays his taxes? When the assessor comes 
to his home, should he try to conceal personal property, 
such as stocks and bonds, so as to avoid paying taxes 
on all he owns? Should he try by his patronage to build 
up the business of the city in which he lives or may he 
send orders to the large mail-order houses that sell direct 
to the consumer, and to other business concerns that ad- 
vertise to sell goods more cheaply than the home mer- 
chants do?” In the discussion, which can precede or 
follow a theme on this topic, the class begin to see the 
interdependence of individuals and they agree that selfish 
interests must give way to the common good. 
The teacher who really tries to get down to the funda- 
_mentals will find other subjects of ethical value coming 
up for discussion. The subjects enumerated may sound 
trite, but they have been found of vital interest to boys 
[ 230]
-P-A-G-E-239
PREPARATION FOR A VOCATION 
and girls. Some of these questions cannot be settled abso- 
lutely and definitely by teacher and class. Their great value 
lies in stimulating pupils to earnest thought and action. 
SAMPLE EXERCISES BY ELEVENTH-GRADE 
STUDENTS 
Swati I co To CoLLecE? My CuHoIce 
When a young man enters the high school he begins to hear 
more or less about going to college, and sooner or later he 
becomes interested in the subject and decides for himself whether 
or not he will go on with his studies after he has completed the 
high school. There was a time when a great many boys could 
not go to college if they wished to, for the simple reason that 
either there was not any college near them or they did not have 
the means to attend a higher institution of learning. To-day 
both of these obstacles have been overcome, for there are 
several colleges in every state in the Union, and in nearly all 
of these institutions there are opportunities offered the boy 
who needs them to work his way through. 
By the time a boy has reached his junior year in the high 
school he has usually made up his mind whether he will have 
a college education, but sometimes he is still debating the ques- 
tion. Usually he is at an age where the desire to get out into 
the world and make a place for himself is strong. He thinks 
the years spent in college are a waste of time, devised by teachers 
and parents to keep him in bondage longer. I think this is the 
reason that so small a percentage of young men who graduate 
from the high school plan to go to college. 
“Should I go to college?” I keep asking myself. My teachers 
and pzrents say, “Yes.” But there is John Smith. Everyone 
knows what a great success he has made in business. He had 
only two or three years in the high school. Why should I go to 
is» Am I not as bright as John Smith? “ True,” say my 
teachers, “here is John Smith, who has attended the high school 
[231] 
ne 
 
-P-A-G-E-240
  
  VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
only two or three years and has made a great success, but 
what of that? John Smith had those qualities in him that would 
make him a success whether or not he had the advantage of an 
education. And perhaps if he had had the advantages of a col- 
lege training, he would have been a broader, greater, and far 
more successful man than he is to-day.” Still I am not con- 
vinced. I admit that in a good many vocations the training a 
college education gives one is absolutely necessary ; but I think 
that in the vocation I have chosen, which is farming, a college 
education is a waste of time and money. I am told to look at 
certain very successful farmers in my neighborhood and to find 
out if they are not agricultural-college graduates. Upon inquiry 
I find that the most successful of these farmers have had the 
benefits of agricultural-college training and can get more out 
of their farms than those farmers who have not had scientific 
training. Moreover, these same farmers are always ready to 
advise young men who wish to become good farmers to take 
scientific training. 
They have demonstrated that the training the agricultural 
college gives teaches a young man many valuable things in 
regard to farming. It teaches him what kinds of fruit are most 
profitable to grow, in what kinds of soil this fruit will best grow, 
the proper time of year for setting out, spraying, and trimming 
fruit trees, and what kinds of spraying mixtures to use. An 
agricultural college also teaches him the latest and best scientific 
methods of planting, cultivating, and harvesting all kinds of 
farm produce. It has a course in the chemistry of soils. It tells 
a young farmer how to put up his produce in the most attrac- 
tive manner for market ; it instructs him in dairy farming, which 
is a science if it is properly and profitably done; and it teache: 
him the advantages of modern machinery in farming. Be- 
cause of all these facts I have at last decided to go to college. 
Now the question arises, which is the best college for me? 
Of course, it must be an agricultural college, to fit me for my 
vocation. I intend to work my way through college, and ‘here- 
fore there must be opportunities to earn money at the college 
[ 232 ]  
-P-A-G-E-241
  PREPARATION FOR A VOCATION 
I attend. This college must also be one of the best, for I wish 
to get the greatest possible returns from the money and time 
that I spend there. After careful study, investigation, and 
thought I have chosen the Michigan Agricultural College, for 
it is the most accessible and is the oldest and one of the best 
equipped agricultural colleges in the United States, The college 
is active in athletics, but does not go into them to excess. It is 
coeducational and is noted for its democratic spirit. 
I think I have done wisely in choosing it, for it comes the near- 
est to meeting my demands for a college. I am only a junior 
in the high school, but I eagerly await the day when I shall 
pass through the doors of the Michigan Agricultural College. 
ErHIcAL PROBLEMS IN THE ARCHITECTURAL PROFESSION 
There are many problems of right and wrong that confront 
the architect. Many of these seem trivial, yet they have a great 
influence in molding his character and the character of his work ; 
and as he is thrown into constant contact with various classes 
of people, his character and work will have a great influence on 
the community in which he lives. The object of this essay is 
to set forth some of the most important of his problems and 
the effect his work will have upon a community. 
Let us first consider the business side of his profession. 
Here there are many temptations to be dishonest and to betray 
the trust that is placed in him. As the architect is in constant 
touch with contractors and builders, his clients often rely on 
his recommendation when choosing a contractor. In this case, 
the architect must choose the best and most efficient contractor, 
regardless of his personal relations with the latter. He should 
never allow himself to recommend a contractor or builder be- 
cause the latter is his personal friend, when he knows that his 
friend is incompetent or dishonest. 
Again, the architect must look after the interests of both 
contractor and client; that is to say, he is the authority on all 
disputes that may arise between them. He is the one who must 
[ 233 ] 
 
-P-A-G-E-242
  VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
interpret the terms of the contract drawn up between the con- 
tractor and client. Here there is a chance to show favoritism, 
which no true architect would ever do. It is his business to 
see that both contractor and client faithfully fulfill their obliga- 
tions to each other, as set forth in the contract, and that neither, 
in any way, takes advantage of the other. 
Often the architect can make a “tip.” This means that, if 
he will recommend a certain contractor regardless of the lat- 
ter’s ability to erect the building, he will receive a reward. 
Sometimes it may be a percentage of the profit; again, it may 
be that the contractor will secure a client for the architect in 
exchange for the architect’s recommendation of him. On the 
other hand, the architect may be promised favors from manu- 
facturing concerns for recommending their products. In either 
case he should refuse to be influenced by these glowing prom- 
ises and make his choice of a contractor from the standpoint 
of ability to do the best work, and of a manufacturer from the 
standpoint of the durability of his materials. 
The foregoing points can best be illustrated by this little 
story. Not long ago a lady, wishing to remodel her home, 
went to an architect and had him draw up a plan. As she knew 
little or nothing of contractors, she naturally turned to the archi- 
tect for advice and asked him to recommend a good contractor 
to her. The architect, knowing her to be ignorant of the char- 
acter of contractors and seeing a chance to make a little extra 
fee, took advantage of her and recommended one of his friends, 
who promised to divide profits with him if he got the job. The 
contract was drawn up and work started, but it did not progress. 
The contractor worked on it only when he had nothing else to 
do. The contract had called for yellow-pine floors on the second 
floor, but as white pine was cheaper and the contractor thought 
the lady would never know the difference, he substituted it for 
the yellow pine, and in a little while there were great cracks 
in the floor where the pine had shrunk. There were several 
other instances where the contractor had deliberately substituted 
cheaper materials for the materials called for, and the architect, 
[ 234 ]  
-P-A-G-E-243
  ae 
PREPARATION FOR A VOCATION 
knowing it, did nothing to make him live up to his contract. 
The work dragged on so slowly that the woman called in a 
friend who knew something about the work. When he found 
out what had been done, and that the architect did not intend to 
hold the contractor to the contract, he advised her to take the case 
into court, which she immediately did. The result was that both 
architect and contractor were dismissed, after being paid a fair 
sum for their services, and an honest builder was employed. 
Another very important point to consider is carelessness on 
the part of the architect in performing the duty of superintend- 
ing the construction of a building. If he neglects this duty, he 
is not only betraying the trust placed in him by his client but 
he is also dishonest, for he is receiving remuneration for work 
he does not do. He should be “on the job” every minute, 
for if he is not, he may allow the contractor to use materials 
that will not stand the strain placed upon them, and, in this 
way, make the building unsafe or make it a fire trap. He should 
also demand that the builder use the best and most improved 
methods of construction to insure the stability of the building. 
But the client is not the only one to be considered. The lives 
of the hundreds of people who must either pass by or enter 
this building are endangered if the architect does not do his 
duty. Let me illustrate this point by a story. A young archi- 
tect, who was just beginning to practice his profession, drew the 
plans for a large hotel. As this was his first big piece of work, he 
determined to make as much from it as possible. The contractor 
who built the hotel was an unscrupulous man and offered to divide 
the profits with the architect if the latter would allow him to build 
it cheaply. The architect at first would not listen, but finally the 
desire to make money overcame his moral scruples and he 
yielded to the temptation. When the building was completed, 
it was poorly constructed, and, worst of all, a fire trap. The 
young man was in constant fear that some day it would either 
burn or topple down. A year or so passed. The architect had 
nearly overcome his fears, when one day a cry of fire was heard 
from the street. All his old fears were again awakened, and he 
[235] 
 
-P-A-G-E-244
VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
hurried into the street to see what was burning. To his horror, 
it was the hotel. The whole building was in flames. There were 
hundreds of people in the upper stories that could not reach the 
fire escapes. Many of them jumped out of the windows and 
were either killed or horribly mangled. All possible means were 
used to save the building and inmates, but all in vain. The hotel 
was completely destroyed and many people lost their lives. All 
the newspapers placed the blame of the fire on the architect, 
so that public sentiment became so strong against him that he 
finally had to leave the city with a ruined career. 
Again, an architect may also be careless in determining the 
stress laid on certain materials; for instance, he may make a 
slight mistake in determining the weight to be carried by a roof 
truss, and as a result of this the roof, being too heavy for the 
truss, will some day collapse, causing death and great property 
loss. Knowing this to be true, it is easy to understand that the 
architect cannot be too careful in figuring the weights to be 
placed on the various materials used in constructing a building. 
Perhaps the architect does the greatest good in creating 
beauty and bettering the sanitary condition of a community. 
It has been said, and truly said, that the surroundings of a man 
determine his character. If he is surrounded by dark, unhealth- 
ful, and ugly conditions, his life becomes meaner and poorer in 
every way. He is disheartened, dissatisfied, and out of harmony 
with his fellow men. But, on the other hand, could the same 
man be placed in sanitary, bright, and beautiful surroundings, 
his character would be elevated, he would come to love the 
better and nobler things of life. And, as a result of this, he 
would be a far happier man; he would be of some use in the 
world instead of a detriment to humanity. It is now apparent 
that it should be the desire of every architect to create the 
beautiful, to insure good sanitary conditions and public safety. 
He should refuse to design buildings that will be ugly in appear- 
ance and unsanitary, or that will, in any way, be a detriment to 
the community or tend to degrade those who are compelled to 
work or live in them. 
[ 236 ]
-P-A-G-E-245
  
PREPARATION FOR A VOCATION 
The architect is a potent factor in building up a community, 
in both population and morals. He can educate a community 
to love and desire the beautiful. He can create in it a dislike 
for all things that are ugly. In this way he can develop a com- 
munity in which harmony and beauty are the prevailing char- 
acteristics — harmony, in that buildings are made to harmonize 
with their surroundings. When a person passes through such 
a community, it leaves an impression that is not soon forgotten. 
It makes the community attractive, and people will be drawn 
to it. 
Perhaps nothing has quite the same effect on the minds of 
the people as the public buildings. These seem to influence the 
desire to make all buildings beautiful. There are abundant in- 
stances of this; in fact, in our own city very little attention 
was given to beauty until our new library and post office were 
built. These seemed to give an impetus, and all who build are 
now striving for beauty in office buildings as well as in private 
residences. 
After considering these points it seems to me that the impor- 
tance of an architect in a community cannot be overestimated. 
It is said that the architecture of an age, a race, or a people is 
an index to the civilization of that age, race, or people. If this 
age is to be known by the architecture produced, how careful 
then we should be that only the best works we can produce are 
handed down to characterize this age. Now in concluding I 
would say, an architect should be a man who will consider the 
welfare of the community as well as his own personal interests. 
He should be a man who will direct his entire resources to 
creating beauty and bettering the conditions under which his 
fellow men must live,

  CONTRIBUTION VI 
SOCIAL AND CIVIC ETHICS FROM THE 
STANDPOINT OF THE CHOSEN VOCATION 
By Mrs. Corneia S. Hutsr 
When the occupations of the business and professional 
world have been studied, to which most men devote their 
lives and by which they can earn their living, it is well to 
single out for special study those occupations that are 
distinguished as supported by and for the people because 
they are necessary for public purposes and for the better- 
ment of society. When this subject is taken up for con- 
sideration the class will realize that they are soon to take 
places in our complex society, and that, because they have 
received benefits, they should give support to the admirable 
institutions that make civilization possible. 
Public institutions maintained by gift or subscription 
will supply subjects for one half year, and those maintained 
by taxes, as a part of the machinery of government, will 
supply the other, these last including those maintained in 
connection with the corporations that are organized legally 
and are partly under government control. 
Among the institutions in society supported by gifts 
or contributions are churches, Sunday schools, guilds, the 
Young Men’s and the Young Women’s Christian Associ- 
ation, charity organizations, missions, social settlements, 
[ 238]
-P-A-G-E-247
  SOGIAL AND CIVIC ETHICS 
homes for dependent children, homes for the aged, hospi- 
tals, district nursing, houses of correction, lodges, unions, 
associations of commerce, art leagues, women’s clubs, 
musical societies, historical societies, Daughters of the 
American Revolution, museums, drama leagues, the Con- 
sumers’ League, the Anti-Saloon League, the Woman’s 
Christian Temperance Union, the Red Cross Society, the 
Anti-Tuberculosis Society, the Society for the Prevention 
of Cruelty to Animals, the Boy Scouts, the Camp Fire 
Girls, the Society for Charities and Corrections. The list 
can be extended if desired. These are the institutions 
to which all should lend support, by money or kind, by 
personal service or sympathy, by vote or voice. 
After a brief discussion each member of the ciass can 
select one institution, or propose some other, that he will 
make a study of. He probably has a genuine interest in 
some one of the subjects mentioned, because of his own 
plans or the experiences of his own friends or relatives, 
and will propose to work on that. If he is intending to 
be a lawyer, he may choose to write about labor unions or 
the Anti-Saloon League ; if he means to be a physician, he 
may take hospitals or the work of the Anti-Tuberculosis 
Society ; a girl will perhaps choose the subject of district 
nursing, the Red Cross Society, or the Camp Fire Girls. 
Having selected his subject, each pupil will proceed to 
find his own material. He has now reached a stage when 
it is desirable that he should be able to do independent 
work in collecting, organizing, and presenting a large body 
of facts, assisted by his teacher’s suggestions and guided 
by consultations. Part of his material he will obtain from 
the reference library after consulting the index; some 
[ 239] 
 
-P-A-G-E-248
    VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
facts he will obtain by personal visits to the institution 
studied and by conversation with the officials in charge, 
and others by consulting reports and bulletins. By ingenuity 
he will discover many sources of information. 
Having gathered all the facts that he can, and come to 
an understanding of the importance to society of the in- 
stitution he is to write about, he is asked to answer the 
questions, ‘‘ What does a citizen in my vocation owe to this 
institution 1G hat has society a right to expect from me?” 
He is told that in writing his composition he is to present 
three lines of thought: first, the purpose and growth of 
this institution ; second, its status in his city; third, his 
individual responsibility toward it. 
The iting of a long, formal essay presenting the ideas 
he has on the subject, with a bibliography, outline, and 
marginal notes —this is a labor to stimulate him to his 
best effort, and he does the work with uncommon satis- 
faction. Essays of forty pages are not uncommon, and 
occasionally fifty pages will not contain all the interesting 
material that has been gathered. Usually the outline shows 
something of the history of the subject, gives an exposition 
of present conditions, of bad conditions that have been 
bettered, and of good ones that are hoped for and pro- 
jected. Because here the point of view is not merely per- 
sonal, but social, this work is perhaps the most effective 
in fostering public spirit. Each pupil instinctively ranges 
himself in the ranks of those who are working for the good 
and the better things, and “Each for All” becomes his 
motto, 
After the correction of his written theme each pupil 
reports to the class orally his method of collecting his 
[240 ] 
 
-P-A-G-E-249
  SOCIAL AND CIVIC ETHICS 
material, where he found it, and the main points that he 
has presented. These reports are very interesting to the 
class, and thus the work of each contributes to the advan- 
tage of all. 
The work of the second semester is designed to give 
the pupil a keen sense of civic responsibility) When asked, 
“What institutions does the state maintain for the people, 
incidentally giving occupations to some of its citizens?” 
the class will readily suggest a long list, including schools, 
the police department, the fire department, milk inspec- 
tion, meat inspection, water works, weather bureau, board 
of health, city hospitals, garbage disposal, highway com- 
mission, tax office, land office, post office, poor depart- 
ment, jails, prisons, asylums for the insane, courts, libraries, 
museums, parks, playgrounds, army, navy —an indefinite 
list, which is swelled by the institutions which the state 
charters and to some extent directs, such as banks, insur- 
ance companies, railroads, and telegraph companies. 
The method of conducting investigations in this work is 
like that of the previous semester, and the presentation of 
each institution includes something of its origin, its history, 
its organization as it exists at present, and its aims and hopes 
for the future. After each pupil has studied the good 
work that he has chosen for his subject, his report to the 
class enlists the interest and sympathy of the rest. What 
he says about his personal responsibility is usually earnest 
and sincere, and the response of the class gives satisfying 
evidence of the value of this composition work for our 
young people. 
As a whole the twelfth-grade work is particularly grati- 
fying in the breadth of outlook that it gives young people.

  VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
Some pupils have been led by it into personal contact 
with the great movements to help the weak and raise the 
fallen, to encourage men in faith and brotherly action, 
and to inspire them on their way. The investigation of 
civic and national affairs has often aroused a compelling 
sense of individual responsibility which must bear fruit 
in better citizenship. 
SAMPLE EXERCISES BY TWELFTH-GRADE 
STUDENTS 
Wuy I sHOULD BE INTERESTED IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
The public schools, as we know them, are a comparatively 
recent development in public education. It was not until well 
into the nineteenth century that anything like the organized 
school system of to-day was established. I shall not attempt in 
this essay to give more than a glimpse in passing of the public 
schools of other countries, but will confine myself to our own 
land, with special reference to the changes and progress of the 
last few years. 
The public school originated in Spain and forms one among 
many debts which the modern world owes the Moors. The 
idea was soon taken up in Switzerland, and John Calvin, better 
known to us as the founder of a religious sect than as an 
educator, developed it in Geneva. From there it spread to 
Holland, where it found immediate favor. The schools and 
colleges of the Netherlands have long been famous. There is 
no finer story in all history than that of the founding of the 
University of Leyden, which was given to the city as the best 
reward the inhabitants could ask in return for their heroic de- 
fense of their city when itwas besieged during the Spanish wars. 
It is not to be supposed that the Pilgrim Fathers lived long 
in Holland without absorbing some of her educational ideas, 
and it is, in fact, among the settlers of New England who had 
[242]
-P-A-G-E-251
          
          colleges, even Harvard and Yale, were mode 
Public education in the United States w 
before the nation had been formed, in th 
to the English tutorial system. Thi dren of these 
landowners had tutors in their own ho it was not until 
after the Revolution that public education received any encourage- 
ment. In the North, however, it was quite different. As early 
as 1642 a law was passed in the Massachusetts Bay Colony 
requiring all parents and masters to see that all children under 
their care were properly trained. Another law, passed in 1647, 
provided for the establishment of an elementary school in every 
town of fifteen householders, and a Latin and grammar school 
in every town of one hundred householders. All expenses so 
incurred were to be paid by the people whose children were 
benefited by the schools. About three years later the Con- 
necticut Colony adopted this law without modifications, and 
later in the seventeenth century all New England with the ex- 
ception of Rhode Island came under it. From this time on 
until the middle of the nineteenth century there was a period 
of rapid growth for the public schools. In many of the states 
large grants of land were put aside for educational pur- 
poses. New York and Massachusetts led in this movement, 
and by the middle of the nineteenth century a complete system 
of elementary schools had been established. High schools had 
been founded, and the first normal school was sending out 
trained teachers to supply their demands. This work was done 
in Massachusetts by Horace Mann, and in Connecticut by 
Henry Barnard. 
Since the middle of the nineteenth century the tendency has 
been towards a union of all parts into a compact system, which 
is tending all the time to a greater centralization, As the system 
[243]   
 
-P-A-G-E-252
  VOCATIONAL AND MORAL: GUIDANC 
now ‘stands it coxsists of, first, an elementary school of eight 
grades ; second, a high school of four grades; third, a college 
course regularly occupying four years. Almost all the states 
have, state universities. All have high and primary schools. 
There are also the country schools, organized into districts, 
and under the control of a school board. These are commonly 
ungraded. The schools are almost entirely under state control, 
since the National Educational Bureau in Washington is little 
more than a bureau for the distribution of information and 
pamphlets relating to education. 
This is the way in which the public schools stood until within 
the last few years. But having successfully built up a school 
system we immediately set out to reform it. It is, I think, a 
good sign. We have not allowed ourselves time in which to 
establish precedent and prejudice. 
The chief charges against the public schools are that they 
are too largely preparatory schools for the colleges and univer- 
sities. That does not prove their inefficiency. They were made 
for that purpose and are only fulfilling their destiny. The real 
charge should be that, although the need for schools that are not 
purely preparatory has arisen, the schools have not changed to 
conform to that need. This they are now doing. 
It has been proved by statistics that only two per cent of all 
the pupils who enter the first grade ever go to college. ‘“ What, 
then,” came the question, ‘‘ becomes of the ninety-eight per cent 
who drop out of school before that time? Those who do 
drop out have too little education that would or could benefit 
them in any line of industry. In what manner does this elaborate 
system of academic education which we have built up with the 
expenditure of so much time and money, benefit them in their 
life work?” To these questions no satisfactory answer was 
given. There was none to give. 
However, all over the world, in Europe and America, the 
best teachers have taken up this task, namely, of broadening 
the public schools so that they will fit the needs of the ninety- 
eight instead of the two per cent. 
[244]

   SOCIAL AND CIVI 
  This brought about the beginning of wit is called “ manual 
training.” There is a strong tendency in tIN§ Country to dif- 
ferentiate sharply between manual training giv&) 48 a feature 
of education, and specialized instruction given\to selected 
groups for purely vocational ends. 
‘As in other matters educational, Massachusetts was“the first 
to attempt manual training. In the beginning strong emphasis 
was laid on drawing as an art to be taught in the public schools. 
It was felt that America was behind Europe in this respect, 
and drawing became an important factor in Massachusetts 
education because of its place in manufacturing industries. 
From this time on it was rapidly developed in all parts of the 
United States, and in 1880, through the efforts of Calvin A. 
Woodward, the St. Louis Manual Training School was opened 
in connection with the Washington University. The work of 
this school attracted wide attention, and its success led to the 
establishment of other schools similarly organized. 
Not until 1884 was manual training introduced into the 
grade schools. It took root slowly and developed slowly, but 
now exists in some form in all the grades. The smaller children 
are started with paper folding and cutting. In the third and 
fourth grades they are taught basket weaving and clay pottery. 
Until the sixth grade the boys and girls work together. Then, 
however, they are divided; the boys do bench work and the 
girls first do simple sewing and later, in the eighth grade, 
domestic science. 
In the high schools special courses have been added to the 
general curriculum. These include in the larger cities domestic 
science, domestic art, with a special department for millinery, 
courses in housekeeping, designing; arts and crafts, interior 
decorating, drawing, mechanical drawing, and furniture design- 
ing. Athletics, which were formerly confined almost entirely to 
colleges, have been systemized and organized in the schools. 
Gymnasium work for both boys and girls has been introduced. 
Many schools have school papers, which are managed by the 
pupils. Clubs and organizations of, by, and for the pupils have 
[245]
-P-A-G-E-254
  VOCATIONALAAND MORAL GUIDANCE 
sprung up with myhroom growth to train the youth of the 
land in the duties/of future citizenship. 
All these lptter, which are, indeed, only manual training 
broadened gut, go under the name of “student activities.” 
They make for the rounding off of the corners of the square 
peg to-ft the round hole when there does not happen to be 
a square hole handy, instead of leaving it a misfit or requir- 
ing it to wear itself into shape by the useless expenditure of 
much energy. 
How this will end it is difficult to say. Vocational guidance 
and industrial training are yet too new for anyone to predict 
the outcome. There is, however, a general feeling that they 
will solve the problem of the ninety-eight per cent who used to 
fall out, and that the schools will finally connect as closely with 
the industrial world as they do now with the colleges. 
So much for the general school system of our land. I next 
gathered, as far as I was able, information concerning the 
schools of my own city, and I found that they compare not 
unfavorably with those of other cities. There are, besides the 
regulation grade and high schools, several other kinds of public 
schools here. The schools for exceptional children take care 
of subnormal children, They are taught basket weaving, clay 
modeling, domestic art and science —all the simpler forms of 
manual training, but very little regular school work. We have 
a school for the blind under city supervision, which also takes 
care of deaf children. We have one open-air school and one 
semiopen-air school. The first is ungraded, like the district 
schools, and is in charge of only one teacher. The results, 
therefore, are not especially fine, because the pupil cannot have 
the individual attention he would otherwise receive. The second 
school has adopted the system of having the children study 
with the windows wide open. The truant school is for the boys 
and girls who have a chronic habit of “ playing hooky.” It is 
under supervision of the Juvenile Court. The night schools, 
I believe, are quite extensive. They are held in the different 
school buildings all over the city, and courses are offered in 
[ 246 ] 
 
-P-A-G-E-255
SOCIAL AND CIVIC ETHICS 
every subject that is in the high-school curriculum, besides in 
elementary work. 
Another form of school activity is the social-center work. 
Meetings are held in the evening in the various school buildings 
for parents and pupils alike. Their aim is mainly social, 
although courses in millinery and dressmaking are offered 
in some. 
Manual training has been taken up quite extensively in the: 
high school. Both Union and Central High Schools have good 
courses in domestic science and sewing, and Union High 
School has an especially fine equipment for shop work. 
In vocational guidance much is being done in our Central 
High School. The work is started as early as the seventh 
grade in the Junior High School and is carried on in connection 
with the English Department. It consists, in general, of oral 
and written compositions on themes which are mapped out for 
the different grades, and which direct the pupils’ attention to 
the lives of successful men and women, to the different occu- 
pations open to them, to the various preparatory schools and 
colleges, and, finally, to the relation of the individual to society 
and the state. These themes are made subjects for class dis- 
cussion. This is one of the great movements of the times, and 
the day seems not far distant when the public schools will have 
broadened to a much larger sphere of usefulness. 
As yet Grand Rapids has no regular continuation schools. 
These are schools which, by arrangement with the employer, 
permit the boy or girl who is working to attend school part of 
the time and still be under payment from the employer. The 
pupils generally study the occupation at which they are working, 
together with some regular school lessons. 
At the Junior High School, however, the printing school is 
conducted, in part, on this plan. There are from one hundred 
and forty to one hundred and fifty pupils studying this trade, and 
some of these are working as apprentices in printing offices. 
There are also forty pupils who are taking the short commercial 
course which is practically a continuation course. So, although 
[247 ] 
 
-P-A-G-E-256
  VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
we have no continuation schools, as such, we have the beginnings 
of them, and our further needs are not so much for new lines of 
work as for the better development of those we already have. 
It is to be hoped that all of these schools will soon be enlarged 
and developed to fit the growing need. The school for the 
blind and that for exceptional children are both much too small. 
The open-air school is still in the experimental stage, but the 
good work done there under difficulties is sufficient argument 
for more teachers and a larger enrollment. We hope that in a 
few years all these schools may be large enough to meet the 
demands so extensively made upon them. 
Having, then, come to a larger realization than before of 
what is meant by the public-school system, I must naturally 
face the question of what my obligation and my responsibility 
toward the schools are to be when I have finished my education 
and am ready to enter upon my duties as a citizen. 
It is quite possible that I shall take up journalism for my 
future vocation. The field is broad. One deals with real men 
and women and real events. All this makes it appeal strongly to 
me. In this case the schools would affect me in the training they 
did or did not give me, for although I might go to college and 
study journalism, still the public schools, grade and high, would 
have given me the basis of my training. My civic duty to them 
would not be greater if I were a journalist than if I followed 
only the vocation of home making, but its chance for expression 
would be infinitely greater. It would be my duty to see that all 
facts concerning the schools were presented to the public in a 
truthful and unprejudiced manner, to support the men best 
fitted for any school office, and to explain intelligently to the 
public at large the needs, faults, and virtues of the public- 
school system. 
If I should remain at home, either married or single, my civic 
duty to the schools would be the same. I should support them 
as I would any public institution which makes for the better- 
ment of mankind. If I remained single, they would affect me 
only in a general way,.and I should support them because 
[248 ] 
   
-P-A-G-E-257
  
SOCIAL AND CIVIC ETHICS 
schools make for education, education makes for peace, peace 
makes for prosperity, and so on in an endless chain of benefits. 
If, on the other hand, I married and had children, I should be 
most vitally affected. I should then take an interest in the pub- 
lic schools, help them, criticize them, and encourage them, as they 
could affect the education of my children. It is altogether 
probable that in the second case my interest would be deeper 
and at the same time narrower than in the first. 
In any case, married or single, at home or in the industrial or 
professional world, I must in some way be affected by the pub- 
lic schools. It is the same with every boy or girl who attends 
them. Their influence is more widespread than that of the 
church; it is next to that of the home. For this reason they 
must be made more universally useful and must broaden to 
include all pupils and to train them in all ways for future citizen- 
ship in the nation. 
Wuy iL AS AN ELECTRICAL ENGINEER, SHOULD BE INTERESTED 
IN THE GRAND Rapips ASSOCIATION OF COMMERCE 
I have selected this organization for the subject of my voca- 
tional theme for the reason that I am greatly interested in civic 
welfare and in the results which a body of public-spirited citizens 
can bring about through their united efforts in the right direc- 
tion. Moreover, the work of this Association is so well known 
that it is not a question of whether it is doing good work, but a 
question of what more it can do in its many-sided activities. It 
has been in existence over eleven years, and its place is so well 
established that its usefulness is no more questioned ; I am not 
writing about theory, but about facts. 
Since its establishment eleve. ago, when its member- 
ship was of course very low, it has developed into a body of 
over one thousand business and professional men in every walk 
of life, representing every industrial, commercial, and civic ac- 
tivity in our city. These men are all practical business men who 
are interested as much in the city’s growth as they are in the 
[ 249 ]
-P-A-G-E-258
     
  VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
growth of their own business ; they provide big things, in a big 
way, and with a big object in view. 
Every good-sized city in our country has such associations, 
and they are doing a vast amount of work which would other- 
wise be undone, for it is out of the regular system of govern- 
ment, which the city rule looks after. 
An organization such as this also helps toward the social 
betterment of the community and produces a democratic spirit, 
where everyone fights or labors for the rest. This is the purpose 
of the Wednesday-noon lunches, held by the Association of 
Commerce. At these gatherings prominent speakers in differ- 
ent lines of industry and commerce give ideas, and criticize 
wherever they think best, thus introducing new subjects which 
can be taken up by the various committees and departments, 
and acted upon. 
I shall now tell some of the benefits this organization has 
brought about, through its many-sided interests, in as many 
directions. 
First, taking the Industrial Department of the Association, we 
find that during 1911 it brought two important propositions, 
along with many minor ones, before the public. They were the 
organizing of a company to manufacture dynamos and motors, 
and the securing of the Decatur Truck Company for this city 
if one hundred thousand dollars’ worth of stock could be sold 
here. These two propositions were carried to a successful end 
by the committees appointed to investigate, with the result that 
the Decatur Truck Company is now well established here, while 
the manufacturing company is started. 
In addition this department has assisted in organizing the 
Grand Rapids Pearl Button Company, the Grand Rapids Ho- 
siery Company, the Textile Machinery Company, and the Car- 
penter-Udell Chemical Company. The Van-L Commercial Car 
Company was also persuaded to come here, and the Silverman 
building was leased for them. These various companies are 
making great strides in development, and are surely “ putting 
Grand Rapids on the map.” 
[250]
-P-A-G-E-259
  SOCIAL AND CIVIC ETHICS 
We now come to a very important branch of the Association, 
the Municipal Department. Many things are taken up by it 
for which the municipal government of our city has no time) 
money, or interest, such as the work of compiling the statis- 
tics to show the cost of the scarlet-fever epidemic of 1909 and 
1g1o. The advantage of this was that the figures showed a 
loss of ninety thousand dollars to the public. In this way the 
public, by seeing the loss to their pocketbooks, were impressed 
with the necessity of avoiding contagious diseases. 
This branch also influenced the agitation of the housing prob- 
lem, so that five different charitable societies have taken it up and 
have done much good work with the suggestions received from 
the secretary of the National Housing Association. This prob- 
lem is of vital interest to every citizen of our city; the work of 
this department shows its public spirit. 
Another important improvement which it has brought about 
is the new boulevard system of street lighting, which was in- 
stalled last fall. We are indebted to this same department for 
the recently organized Grand Rapids Park and Boulevard As- 
sociation. Although this body has been in existence only two 
years, it has procured the passing of a bill giving it the right to 
“buy or sell, accept by gift, or condemn and improve property 
for parks and boulevard purposes.” The first gifts received 
were the Hodenpyl property on the north side of Reed’s Lake 
and the Bonnel gift on the east and south shores of the lake. 
Since then the Association has been at work improving these 
parks by digging canals and constructing roads. In years to 
come this land around Reed’s Lake will comprise one of our 
most beautiful parks. 
In another direction the Municipal Department has exerted 
its influence in obtaining the right of way across the Pére 
Marquette Railroad, in order that the Grand River Boulevard 
may be constructed. This gives a park of seventy-two acres, 
and completes the right of way to Grandville. 
An important branch of this department is the Convention 
Bureau. Through its labors the Michigan State Teachers’ 
[251]
-P-A-G-E-260
VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
Association was secured in1g12. This was the biggest convention 
held here during that year. The Association of Commerce also 
assisted greatly with money and time in giving the teachers 
a hospitable welcome and leaving a lasting remembrance of 
Grand Rapids in their minds. 
Now that I have found out how valuable the work of this 
organization is, the question which naturally comes to my mind is 
what my personal attitude toward it should be. I have selected 
as my vocation some branch of engineering work, and I will give 
my reasons, from the viewpoint of an engineer, for my interest 
in civic bodies like the Grand Rapids Association of Commerce. 
First, if I was looking for a promising and progressive city 
in which to locate, I should go to its Association of Commerce 
and inquire concerning the prospects and advantages of their 
city. If they could show that they had gained a good percent- 
age of factories the preceding year; that building permits had 
increased over the year before; that the post-office receipts had 
shown a healthy advance, proving that business was on a thriv- 
ing basis; that the savings deposits also had grown, bringing 
out the fact that labor was on a paying and firm foundation ; 
and last, and, I think, the most important, that the bank clear- 
ings had increased, I should very likely locate in that city, 
because I should have confidence in its reputation and in the 
outlook for my particular work there. 
Secondly, I should inquire as to the health and sanitary con- 
ditions in that city, whether they had pure water, baby clinics, 
good hospitals, and an efficient Board of Health. 
If after all this investigation the results came up to my 
standard of a progressive city, I should most certainly locate 
there with the assurance that I was starting under the best of 
conditions. 
But because I am deeply interested in civic work of all kinds, 
and because membership in an Association of Commerce would 
be to my own benefit, I should at once join such an association 
and boost it with all my strength, in order to make the city of 
my selection better in any small way possible.

HOW TO GET A CERTIFICATE 
Go to the Work Certificate Office, where you will be given four cards: 
(1) a health card, to be filled out by your district physician, whose 
name, address, and office hours will be written on the card for you; 
(2) a birth card, to be filled out by (2) the Bureau of Vital Statistics of 
the city or township in which you were born or (4) the pastor of the 
church in which you were christened. In case neither of these records 
is in existence, you must return to the Certificate Office for further 
instructions about a birth record; (3) a card to be filled out by the 
principal of the school you last attended, stating that you have com- 
pleted the grade required, or that you are so much retarded mentally 
that you cannot complete the grade required; and (4) a card to be 
filled out and signed by the firm that is going to hire you. No certificate 
will be issued until all four cards, properly filled out and signed, have 
been brought to the office. 
WHERE TO GET A CERTIFICATE 
On the second floor of the old Hughes High School, West Fifth 
Street, foot of Mound. 
WHEN TO GET A CERTIFICATE 
Any week day, except Saturdays and legal holidays, from 8.30 A.M. to 
noon and from 1 P.M. to 3 P.M.; Saturdays from 9 A.M. to noon. 
CONTINUATION SCHOOL 
Every boy under sixteen years of age, who has not successfully com- 
pleted the Eighth Grade, must attend continuation school four hours a 
week, between the hours of 8 A.M. and 5 p.M.— hence attendance at 
night school cannot be accepted instead. Boys and girls over sixteen 
years of age may attend continuation school for special work, and are 
urged to consult with the continuation-school authorities about doing so. 
WHEN YOU QUIT YOUR JOB 
You must report the reason immediately to the office where you got 
your certificate. This report may be made by postal. Boys under six- 
teen years who are out of work two weeks or more, or who have been 
guilty of misconduct or inconstancy, may be required to return to full- 
time day schools. 
HELP AND EMPLOYMENT 
May be obtained through the office that issues the certificates. The 
law requires the office to keep a file of the children holding certificates, 
to which employers in need of help may have access. The office is 
very glad to assist children who are looking for work, either directly or 
by referring them to reliable employment agencies. 
EMPLOYERS, BEFORE ALLOWING THE CHILD TO BEGIN WORK 
Must have in their possession either a work certificate or a legal birth 
record proving that the child is old enough to work without a certificate. 
[254]
-P-A-G-E-263
  A BUREAU’S SYSTEM OF CARD INDEXES 
RETURN OF THE CERTIFICATE TO THE CHILD 
By the employer is forbidden by law. Within forty-eight hours of the 
time employment ceases, the employer must mail the work certificate 
to the issuing office, giving the reason for the child’s withdrawal or dis- 
missal. The report should state: (1) Left without notice; (2) Volun- 
tarily (if exact reason is not known) ; or (3) Discharged for this or that 
reason. Jf the certificate is not returned promptly as required by law, the 
employer is legally liable for the full amount of the child's wages until 
such time as the certificate is returned. Two days’ unexcused absence on 
the part of the child constitutes termination of employment. 
HOURS OF WORK 
For boys under sixteen years and girls under eighteen must not be 
more than forty-eight hours a week, nor more than eight hours in any 
one day, nor before 7 A.M. or after 6 P.M. 
RATE OF PAY 
And hours of work must be stated to the child in writing by the employer 
before it is allowed to begin work; and retention of any part of the 
child’s pay because of presumed negligence, violation of rules, breakage 
of machinery, or incompetence, is forbidden by law.

CONTRIBUTION VIII 
APPLICATION OF VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE TO 
THE YOUNG MEN’S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION 
By THE EpucaTionaL DEPARTMENT OF THE ASSOCIATION 
AT MINNEAPOLIS, MINNESOTA 
The educational and employment departments of the 
Young Men’s Christian Association have been pidneers in 
the field of vocational guidance. Several associations have 
had special advisers and have developed very successful 
methods in counseling the young men who apply to them 
for admission to evening classes or for assistance in finding 
a suitable occupation. The associations in Boston, Buffalo, 
New York, Cleveland, and Minneapolis have all worked 
along similar lines. The blank forms reproduced in this 
contribution are those used by the Minneapolis association. 
The young man, upon his first interview with the coun- 
selor, is given good advice in regard to the problem of 
choosing a vocation and is handed the following folder to 
read and study seriously before he attempts to arrive at a 
final decision in the matter. 
SOME GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS TO BE KEPT IN 
MIND WHEN CHOOSING AN OCCUPATION 
Choosing an occupation, or deciding upon a life work, is one of 
the most important questions a man is called upon to decide. It is 
much more important than hunting a job, for it determines in large 
measure the trend of development of the whole of one’s future 
[ 262 ]
-P-A-G-E-271
  YOUNG MEN’S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION 
life. There are, accordingly, a few considerations of fundamental 
importance. Some of these are: 
1. To know as accurately as possible your own aptitude and ability 
as well as your own deficiencies. In seeking to know yourself, make 
a careful and absolutely honest analysis of your own character. Put- 
ting this down on paper is not as simple a matter as it appears on 
the surface. A good plan is to find out what your friends and those 
who really know you best, think of you, and thus check your own 
impressions. You will find the thought and effort put into this work 
extremely helpful. 
2. Secure accurate first-hand knowledge of as many occupations 
as possible. Observe as closely as you can the advantages and dis- 
advantages of each. Discover the particular kind of ability or train- 
ing productive of the highest results in each. As far as opportunity 
makes possible, try yourself in as many lines as seem to you promis- 
ing. Feel your way when you can’t see clearly. 
3. General considerations : 
(a) Pronounced success in any occupation a man chooses comes 
only to the one who finds genuine joy in his work. 
(4) Large salaries are paid only for high quality or large quantity 
of work. A man who is not adapted to the work in which he is 
engaged can measure up to this standard only by long years of forced 
adjustment. This is not economical and does not produce happiness 
and contentment. 
(6) Select that vocation in which your own particular kind of 
ability will be of largest service to your fellows as well as produce 
the most for yourself. In the long run a lower motive than this will 
fail to be really satisfactory. 
(d) Remember that all forces follow the lines of least resistance, 
so avoid those occupations which seem to be overcrowded, when- 
ever your particular ability can be utilized along other lines. This 
does not mean that difficulty should be dodged, but rather that effort 
should be invested in such channels as will be productive of the 
largest results. : 
(e) If you can choose between positions, take the one which will 
most fully develop your own initiative and give you the best oppor-- 
tunity for development without reference to immediate returns in the 
form of salary. 
[ 263 ]
-P-A-G-E-272
  VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
(J) Other things being equal, it is wise to choose that occupation 
in which you can utilize to the fullest extent your previous training 
and experience. 
The next and most important step. in the process is the 
self-analysis. The thoroughness with which this is done is 
shown in the confidential blank which is filled out by the 
applicant before he has his interview with the expert 
analyst.

The information found upon the analysis blank is used 
as a basis for a confidential interview with the counselor. 
A personal conference usually obtains much additional 
data upon which advice can be given. 
After this self-analysis has been satisfactorily worked 
out, the expert analyst records his examination of the appli- 
cant, using the following form to chart the characteristics 
of the applicant and to indicate the field of endeavor in 
which he may reasonably expect to succeed.

  YOUNG MEN’S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION 
ANALYSIS BLANK 
USED BY 
CONSULTING VOCATIONAL ANALYST 
  THE MIND IS THE MAN 
The body is simply the instrument through which the mind mani- 
fests itself. The mind is manifested through numerous organs. Each 
is primary and independent in its function, doing its own work, and 
not doing the work of any other. Each of these powers is manifested 
by or through a particular nerve, organ, or portion of the brain. 
The mental powers are possessed originally in different degrees 
by different individuals, and also by the same individual. One pos- 
sesses ten talents, another five, another one. Each mental power 
grows stronger and becomes more skillful by proper exercise. Our 
accountability is just in proportion as we make a good or bad use of 
these talents. Each mental power was created for the purpose of 
doing good, and was intended to be so used. 
Temperamental characteristics 
The difference between the mental and physical activity of indi- 
viduals is mainly temperamental, denoting a mixture of the various 
elements entering into the constitution of the human brain and body, 
and characterizing mind and body in accordance with the predominance 
of the different qualities. Hence the division of the temperamental 
characteristics into Mental, Sanguine, Bilious, and Vital or Lymphatic. 
1. Mental: indicating a preponderance of the perceptive and 
reflective faculties. 
2. Sanguine: indicating a preponderance of the circulatory and 
respiratory ‘organs. 
3. Bilious: indicating a preponderance of the muscles and veins. 
4. Vital or Lymphatic: indicating a preponderance of the ab- 
dominal form and consequent greater sluggishness of 
mind and body.

Summary and Special Remarks 
  Whenever possible the applicant is sent to some suc- 
cessful man in the vocation toward which he has been

work is best fitted to give a full explanation of the demands 
of the vocation itself. He is asked to give the applicant 
an honest and frank opinion of his qualifications for the 
vocation under consideration, and, in answer to questions, 
to give him some’solid facts to think about. The blank used 
for this purpose follows : :

THE LIBRARIAN’S PART IN VOCATIONAL 
GUIDANCE 
By Mary E. Hatt, Grrts’ Hicu Scuoot, Brooxtyn, N.Y.! 
Our first duty as librarians, if we are to aid intelligently 
in this new movement in education, is to take time to read 
a few of the best books or magazine articles on different 
phases of this work as it is being developed in the different 
cities. Once familiar with the general movement, we must 
get in touch with the work in our own schools. It would 
be well to find out the names of the counselors or advisers 
to the students and invite them to a conference with you 
or your staff on ways in which you can help them in their 
work, Find out their special plan of work and how you 
can best aid them by means of lists, reserve shelves for 
books, sending books to the school building, etc. Your 
counselors will probably be the very finest men and women 
of the teaching corps of your city or town. Their new work 
means the use of books, catalogues, pamphlets, and a prac- 
tical use of library methods in keeping a card index of 
pupils, occupations, etc. They will probably welcome what 
suggestions you can give them as to the methods of keep- 
ing material, clippings, pamphlets, etc., and may be glad to

chusetts Library Association and is printed through the courtesy of the

turn that all over to you as librarian. Invite them to an 
informal afternoon tea with you, as has been done so suc- 
cessfully in Binghamton, New York, and in Somerville, 
Massachusetts. You will probably get more suggestions 
from them in this informal way than by a more formal con- 
ference. Make use of any invitation you may have to speak 
to the teachers in their own faculty meeting. Here the 
school librarians have an unusual opportunity to get the 
teachers’ point of view. In the small town where the libra- 
rian knows everyone, she herself would often make the best 
possible counselor. If the work has not been started in the 
schools, create an interest in your library by bulletins calling 
the attention of the teachers and principals to interesting 
books and magazine articles on this subject, and let them 
know the resources of your library, 
In all of our libraries there is a great amount of possible 
material for this work, but it is so widely scattered in differ- 
ent classes of the decimal classification that much of it is 
lost to teachers and students. Much of this material 
is old, and its information on occupations is out of date. 
These books should be carefully weeded out. We need 
new subject headings and cross references in our card cat- 
alogues to aid teachers looking up material on vocational 
guidance. At present this term does not appear in many 
card catalogues of large city libraries. A reclassifying of 
many books would increase their use. At present books 
which ought to stand side by side on the shelves, as far as 
their use to teacher or pupil is concerned, are scattered in 
many different classes. Here is a list of the various classes 
where, in a single library, different books with the same 
general purpose — to show young people what occupations 
[274] 
   
-P-A-G-E-283
  LIBRARIAN’S PART IN VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 
were open to them —were classified : 607, 331, 174, 374, 
304, 177, 396, 640, 658. In some of the high-school 
libraries all these books have for convenience been put in 
one or two of these classes with greatly increased use. 
When this movement began, even the trained and expe- 
rienced librarian had to do some conjuring to corral the 
books needed by the vocational advisers. There were no 
printed lists, and one had to rely on one’s own knowledge 
of the kinds of books needed and the possible places in the 
classification. It might be possible for librarians in general 
to decide upon some one class number where general books 
on vocational guidance could be grouped. 
A typewritten or printed list of the resources of your 
own library and of the best printed bibliographies of other 
libraries should be sent to the principals and vocational 
counselors of each school. The Grand Rapids Public 
Library list is most suggestive for books that are inspira- 
tional and stimulating along ethical and civic lines, and 
the Brooklyn Public Library list “‘ Choosing an Occupa- 
tion” is particularly strong on occupations. 
While the list is of first importance to the teacher, the 
suggestive grouping of books on the shelves will probably 
be the best means of reaching the boys and girls, especially 
if books are supplemented by attractive bulletins 
Have in your teachers’ rooms, or in a corner set apart 
for your teachers, a “counselor’s bookshelf,” as it is called 
in the Central High School of Grand Rapids. Reserve on 
this shelf books which would appeal more to the teacher 
than to the pupil and be suggestive in her work of guidance. 
Have special shelves in a young people’s corner with the 
heading ‘‘ Choosing a Career”; and under some of the 
[275] 
 
-P-A-G-E-284
ee eee ee Ee epee eae Pee 
VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
headings in the list on vocational guidance published by 
the Public Library of Grand Rapids in October, 1913, 
group books which will appeal to boys and girls on such 
topics as ‘“‘ Elements of Success in life,” “ Occupations 
for Boys,” “Vocations for Girls,” ‘ Some Successful Men,” 
“Notable Women of Recent Times,” etc. Have a shelf of 
books and other references on ‘‘ Going to College.” Group 
books on special occupations —for example, secretarial 
work, law, medicine, teaching —and with these include 
pamphlets on these subjects, binding the pamphlets in 
something similar to the Gaylord pamphlet binders, so 
that they can be borrowed for home use. After arranging 
all books which are of a general nature and interesting to 
both boys and girls, set aside a special shelf or shelves for 
the boys and let them feel that that is their particular sec- 
tion, and use the same plan for bringing together the books 
which appeal to girls. Many such biographies as Booker 
Washington’s “‘ Up from Slavery,” Jacob Riis’s ‘‘ Making 
of an American,” etc. appeal quite as much to the girls as 
to the boys and should be on the general shelves. But 
books on occupations for men and those on occupations 
for women are better grouped separately. 
Keep your vocational shelves full of only live books 
which really make an appeal to the students. Do not store 
dead wood. Your best knowledge of these books will come 
from personal talks with the boys and girls as they bring 
back the books. Find out what books they like best and 
why they like them. Encourage them to be perfectly frank 
with you, and do not be shocked or unsympathetic if what 
seems to you trite and mediocre is a favorite book with 
some of these students. It is hard for us to realize how 
[276 ] 
   
-P-A-G-E-285
LIBRARIAN’S PART IN VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 
little some of them have had in their home training. The 
Marden books may seem to say everyday things that every- 
one ought to know, but they are the greatest inspiration to 
many a boy or girl. One would think that a girl’s common 
sense would tell her some of the things that Ruth Ashmore. 
tells in her “ Business Girl,” but it was an eye opener to 
one high-school pupil who was about to leave school for 
work, What would have no message for you or for the 
teacher would be a revelation and opening of new doors 
of vision to many students in our elementary schools and 
high schools. Ask the English teacher to introduce book 
reviews in her English work in the high school, and to have 
the boys and girls write freely their opinions of the voca- 
tional books they have read. Their papers will be of the 
greatest help to you in your work with them, if the teacher 
has succeeded in getting reviews which are spontaneous. 
The librarian and teacher will find some of the most 
practical aids in this vocational work in the inexpensive 
literature published in the cities where the vocational guid- 
ance movement is organized. For the pupils in the last 
year or so of the elementary schools there are the attractive 
pamphlets published by the Vocation Bureau of Boston, 
and the Girls’ Trade Education League, Boston, such 
as pamphlets on the grocer, the baker, etc. for boys, 
and on bookbinding, paper-box making, dressmaking, etc. 
for girls. For the high-school pupil or the college student 
there are the pamphlets on the architect, the banker, the 
landscape architect, etc.; and for girls the publications of 
the Woman’s Educational and Industrial Union, of Bos- 
ton, on bacteriological work for women, medical social serv- 
ice, real estate, etc. The publications of the New York 
[277]  
-P-A-G-E-286
  VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
High School Teachers’ oe are also suggestive and 
practical. Pamphlets of this kind can be bought for from 
five to fifty cents each. The information is up-to-date and 
reliable, and often they are better than any books. Many 
of these are too small to stand on the shelves, as they are 
easily lost. They can be bound in rope manila paper and 
filed in pamphlet boxes, which should stand on the shelves 
with the books on a subject; for example after the books 
on occupations in general for girls, place on the shelf a 
pamphlet box labeled ‘‘ Domestic Science,” and collect in 
this box all small pamphlets, clippings which you have 
mounted, etc. on that topic. In this box should be cata- 
logues of any school of domestic science where one could 
train for the work. Teachers College, Columbia Univer- 
sity, prints special pamphlets showing its courses in this 
subject ; the same is done at Simmons College, etc. Where 
the domestic-science course is printed only in the general 
catalogue of a vocational school or college, bring the course 
out in a card index of vocational material. This card index 
should be made as suggestive as possible of the resources 
of your library. Analyze your college and school catalogues 
as far as vocational subjects are concerned. Enter in this 
card index under the names of occupations references to 
catalogues, pamphlets, clippings, and to magazine articles on 
those occupations ; for example, ‘Secretarial Work” should 
appear as one of the headings, and under that heading cards 
should be filed for all material you have on that subject, or 
a reference made to “The Readers’ Guide,” if that seems 
wiser, for the magazine articles. As a rule, it will pay to 
bring out particularly good magazine articles in this voca- 
tion index. Get your teachers who are specialists to make 
[278]
-P-A-G-E-287
  LIBRARIAN’S PART IN VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 
out for you an outline of necessary qualifications, where to 
prepare, etc. for successful work in their line ; for example, 
our own physical-training department worked out for our 
library a typewritten outline on physical training as an 
opportunity for high-school graduates. Qualifications for 
successful work in this field are stated, a list of all the best 
training schools for physical training is given, and the cost 
of board and tuition in each is listed. There is also a list 
of positions filled by graduates of these different schools, 
minimum and maximum salary which can be expected, etc. 
These outlines can be made for the librarian by the art 
teachers, the domestic-science teachers, etc. Students will 
often want to borrow not only this outline for their parents 
to see but also the catalogues of the schools mentioned. The 
library should have a full supply of up-to-date catalogues 
of colleges and vocational schools. 
Daily papers and magazines are full of excellent material 
on various occupations, on how men are succeeding along 
certain lines, on some of the secrets of success in the lives of 
our successful men and women, and on the difficulties which 
they have overcome. A volunteer corps from the high 
school could probably be secured to collect from all the 
students gifts of clippings, to sort, mount, and label them 
and keep them in large manila envelopes in a vertical 
file, or, as in the Chicago Public Library in the civics 
room, in pamphlet boxes with the pamphlets. Boys are 
usually eager to help in the library and can do this past- 
ing of clippings well, if once trained. Clippings can be 
mounted on the cheapest mimeograph paper and all on the 
same subject filed in one envelope ; for example, ‘“‘ Law,” 
“Stenography,” etc. should have each its own envelope. 
[279]
-P-A-G-E-288
  VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
Some of the most important work the library can do 
is by way of suggestion, and with very little expense or 
labor a librarian can make the vocational bulletin board 
a live factor in this work. Nothing elaborate need be 
attempted. Given the bulletin board of burlap or cork, 
let teachers and pupils know that suitable contributions 
of pictures, post cards, clippings, quotations that will prove 
stimulating and inspiring, etc. will be welcomed. See 
whether a class in the high school would not volunteer to 
take charge of this bulletin board for one month, and have 
an editorial committee of three appointed to change the 
bulletins every week. Post portraits of successful men and 
women of to-day (successful in the highest meaning of 
that term), with short sketches of their lives, of what they 
have done in business or in social service. Select some 
suggestive quotations from Booker T. Washington on 
“Work,” some of the splendid things Carlyle and Ruskin 
have said, Dr. Van Dyke’s little sonnet on “Work” in 
his ‘‘ Three Best Things,” all of which have interested high- 
school boys and girls. Post the small pamphlets on occu- 
pations for boys and girls — those of the Boston Vocation 
Bureau for boys, of the Girls’ Trade Education League, 
etc. Have post cards showing pictures of the colleges and 
vocational schools where some of the students may go to 
prepare for their work, and brief accounts of what these 
offer to boys and girls. Post President Hyde’s words on 
“The Offer of the College” in his ‘‘ College Man and 
College Woman.” A suggestive center for a bulletin board 
is the beautiful colored reproduction of E. H. Blashfield’s 
mural painting on the wall of the Great Hall in the Col- 
lege of the City of New York. This represents Alma 
[ 280 ]
-P-A-G-E-289
LIBRARIAN’S PART IN VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 
Mater leading the graduate out into life with the lighted 
torch which has been kindled by the college. Symbolical 
figures show what the past has contributed through the 
college to fit the boy for life; the great cities of the past 
are represented, — Rome, Athens, etc.,— also the famous 
men of all times in science, literature, public life, etc. 
The picture appeals to the boys and girls. Another pic- 
ture admirably suited for the vocational bulletin board is 
the memorial to Alice Freeman Palmer in the chapel of 
Wellesley College. Here is expressed the same thought — 
Alma Mater leading a girl into life with the lamp of 
knowledge lighted by the college. Reproductions of this 
beautiful work of Daniel Chester French can be purchased 
in Wellesley and probably in other places. Through your 
bulletin board call attention to interesting articles in maga- 
zines, and to new books which will be likely to appeal. 
Annotate your book lists to arouse interest. 
Organize clubs among the pupils in the upper grades of 
the elementary school or in the four years’ course in the high 
school, or possibly among those who have left the grammar 
school and are already at work. Let them study the different 
occupations, the lives of men who have succeeded in them, 
and discuss the opportunities which they offer, the quali- 
fications for success, the preparation needed. Encourage 
debates on the vocations, as ‘‘ Resolved, that the factory girl 
is better off than the girl who goes out to do housework,” 
“the work of the plumber vs. that of the carpenter,” etc. 
Have men and women come to your library and give 
brief talks on the occupations in which they have succeeded 
and the things that make for success. For elementary-school 
children invite a plumber, a printer, a saleswoman from a 
[ 281] 
 
-P-A-G-E-290
  VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
department store, etc. to speak, if you can find those who 
can do it. If you know of some one who has gone out 
from your own community and has succeeded, have him 
speak to the young people in your library, if he comes 
back to town occasionally. If some one has gone out from 
the high school and has made his way in the world, invite 
high-school pupils to hear him. In the Erasmus Hall 
Library, Brooklyn, New York, a series of such talks was 
given to the students, one hundred only out of a school 
of two thousand or more being admitted at a time, and 
that by ticket. Tickets could be had for the asking, up 
to the limit. This limitation made the tickets greatly 
prized. Speakers were secured on all kinds of occupa- 
tions in which men and women are engaged. At afternoon 
tea afterwards, boys and girls had a chance to ask ques- 
tions and talk freely with these successful men and women. 
Representatives of some of the fine vocational schools spoke 
at these library meetings, telling of what training meant to 
many a boy or girl in helping him to just the right kind 
of work. 
The plan in Washington, D.C., of sending out from 
the public library a more or less personal letter to every 
boy or girl graduate as he or she leaves the high school 
might be adopted by many public libraries. This letter 
calls attention to what the public library offers the boy 
and girl in increasing their efficiency in business, oppor- 
tunity for self-education, etc. 
Lastly, and most important of all in this work which the 
library can do in vocational guidance, is the personal work 
of the librarian with the teachers and boys and girls. We 
have our library material well organized, our machinery in 
[ 282 ]
-P-A-G-E-291
LIBRARIAN’S PART IN VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 
perfect working order, but if the human touch is lacking, 
we shall fail to accomplish all that we ought. In our 
children’s rooms the public library lays the very greatest 
stress upon the personal equation, the fitness of the librarian 
to play the part of sympathetic ‘‘ library friend ” to children. 
Few libraries as yet have provided the same kind of library 
friend for the boysand girls of from fourteen to eighteen, who 
leave the children’s room and go out into the adult depart- 
ment of the library with no one thereafter to guide their 
reading. At this crucial period, when character is developing 
so rapidly, when they are ready for some of the best things 
that books can give and for some of the world’s best books, 
we have left them to flounder about as best they can. High- 
school libraries as a rule have failed to realize their great 
opportunity, and the teachers have too often made the use 
of school and public library a task rather than a pleasure. 
In this vocational-guidance movement comes a call for 
teachers and librarians to join forces in giving the same 
careful guidance to the adolescent in his reading that we 
have heretofore given the child. Where a high school has 
study periods, there is a marvelous opportunity for the 
librarian of the public library to persuade the Board of 
Education to appoint a trained and experienced librarian 
to take charge of the library or to permit one of your 
library assistants to go over to the high school and take 
charge of the school library during the school day, or at 
least during the study periods when pupils are free to 
come in and read. Such codperative arrangements have 
been made in the cities of Passaic and Newark, New 
Jersey; Cleveland, Ohio; Portland, Oregon; and Madison, 
Wisconsin. 
[ 283 ] 
 
-P-A-G-E-292
  VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
Once let the right kind of librarian work with teachers 
and pupils within the school, and we shall at last have 
found and cemented fast the connecting link between the 
public library and the high school. This work within the © 
school, instead of diminishing the use of the public library 
by high-school pupils, will increase it a hundredfold. The 
librarian in the high school will be able to get the school 
point of view in many matters, will know each teacher 
and student individually, will have opportunity for talking 
to the students in classes, in clubs, in groups in the library 
at noontime, and will also have what is asked for so often and 
what the school librarian prizes so much —a private talk 
with a boy or girl about books or more frequently about 
life’s problems as they come to boys and girls at this age. 
For the boys discouraged by some physical disability she 
can recommend Mrs. Shaler’s book of courage, ‘‘ Masters 
of Fate,” unfortunately lost in most of our libraries by 
being classed in 130, a shelf of books that few of the 
general public visit. For the girl who has failed or 
has lost faith in herself she will recommend Dr. Gulick’s 
“Mind and Work” or the charming life of Alice Free- 
man Palmer, and drop the remark as she hands out the 
book, ‘‘ You know she failed once, but finally won success.” 
Many students have the wrong attitude toward work and 
need help along this line. A girl would make a first-rate 
milliner, but chooses to be a teacher because in her mind 
it is ‘more respectable.’’ Some of Booker Washington’s 
paragraphs on work, especially manual work that needs 
to be done, will help here. For the last two years of 
elementary school and the four years of high school I 
cannot too strongly emphasize the importance of biography, 
[ 284 ]
-P-A-G-E-293
LIBRARIAN’S PART IN VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 
particularly modern biography — lives of men and women 
of our own generation. We have splendid material for 
this work —lives of Edison, Dr. Grenfell, Jane Addams, 
Ellen Richards, Helen Keller, and Jacob Riis’s ‘‘ Making 
of an American” ; and for older boys the life of William 
Henry Baldwin by John Graham Brooks, entitled “An 
American Citizen.” 
(be Parsons in his ‘‘ Choosing a Vocation” reminds us 
that if we can help a student ‘‘to choose a work in which 
his best abilities and enthusiasms will be united,” we can 
lay a foundation for his success and happiness. Such an 
occupation means love of work, high economic_values, 
superior product, efficient service, and good >) If a 
man’s best abilities and enthusiasms are separatéd from 
his daily work, if his occupation is merely a means of 
making a living and the work he loves to do is side- 
tracked or pushed out of the way altogether, he will be 
only a fraction of the man he ought to be. 
Let us in this work with our boys and girls help them 
to realize with Dr. Henderson what he calls, in his “‘ Edu- 
cation and the Larger Life,” the splendor of life. 
( Life is so great a possession, so unending a procession of delight- 
| ful possibilities, that each day ought to be a new gladness and every 
{ day a veritable holiday. For all the work that is worth doing, rightly 
| handled, is the greatest fun of all the fun that is. Only the work 
| must be worthy, not unnecessary toil, but sturdy, honest work that 
| you can put your whole heart into and do just because you would 
rather do just that particular thing than anything else in the world.

A Junior ASSOCIATION OF COMMERCE 
Commercial organizations in many cities are interested 
in promoting plans to encourage the boys of the com- 
munity in studying local industries and vocational oppor- 
tunities and also in sharing with their elders some social 
and civic responsibilities. 
The Junior Association of Commerce of Grand Rapids, 
Michigan, is organized under the auspices of the Associa- 
tion of Commerce of that city among boys of high-school 
age. One of the senior board of directors is chairman of 
the committee on the Junior Association. This com- 
mittee of business and professional men take an active 
part in promoting the interests of the juniors, and each 
member acts in an advisory capacity in codperation with 
one of the regular committees of the Junior Association. 
Meetings are held in the rooms of the senior association 
and certain club privileges are extended to the junior 
members on Saturday mornings. The juniors join with 
the seniors in civic campaigns and in acting as hosts for 
conventions ; and they are guests at the annual banquets 
of the seniors, sharing with their fathers the spirit of loy- 
alty to the community and the inspiration of social and 
civic patriotism.

Crvic TRAINING AND VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE FOR ALL 
THE ScHOooLs In LincoLn, NEBRASKA 
The following is an abridgment of the report of the 
committee, which proposed an organization that, on the 
recommendation of Superintendent F. M. Hunter, has 
been adopted by the board of education as an integral part 
of the curriculum of the Lincoln city schools: 
One of the most patent needs of this community, as 
of every other, is specific training for efficient citizenship. 
[293]
-P-A-G-E-302
VOCATIONAL AND MORAL GUIDANCE 
The public schools and the business and industrial insti- 
tutions of this city should unite in an effort to help direct 
the young of the community, a great majority of whom 
must enter some industrial pursuit, to know the industries 
and the commercial and business life of the city, to think 
seriously about a place in it for themselves, to choose wisely 
such a place, and to prepare themselves definitely for it. 
It is planned, in accordance with this view, to organize 
a Junior Civic and Industrial League. The purposes of 
this league shall be to study, through first-hand contact 
with the civic and industrial life of the city, the city’s civic 
and industrial needs; to learn, individually and collectively, 
the obligations and responsibilities of young citizens to their 
community; to study the vocational opportunities for young 
men in this city; to make the schools serve more directly 
the highest interests of the community. 
The constitution of the proposed league should be as 
follows : 
ARTICLE I 
NAME 
This organization shall be called the Junior Civic and Industrial 
League of Lincoln, Nebraska. 
ARTICLE II 
PURPOSES 
The purposes of the organization shall be: (1) To study the civic 
and industrial life of the city by first-hand observation; (2) to learn 
what opportunities the industrial life of the city offers to young men; 
(3) to teach its members to think seriously and wisely concerning the 
various vocations studied ; (4) to assist in preparing its members to take 
an active and efficient place in these vocations; (5) to connect more 
closely the work of the public schools with the life of the community ; 
(6) to teach its members to aid effectively in meeting the civic needs 
of the community and to assist every civic institution in Poe 
the general welfare of our city.

obey the city’s laws and do our best to incite a like respect and 
reverence in those above us who are prone to annul or set them 
at naught. We will strive unceasingly to quicken the public’s sense 
of civic duty. Thus in all these ways we will transmit this city not

transmitted to us.”

      EXAMPLES OF INDUSTRIAL 
EDUCATION By Frank MitcHett Leavitt, Associate Professor of Industrial Education, 
The University of Chicago 
8vo, cloth, 330 pages, $1.25 
TREATMENT of the various problems incident to the move- 
ment to establish appropriate and adequate industrial training 
for our future citizens. The author discusses the deeper significance 
of this movement especially in its relation to existing social, eco- 
nomic, and educational conditions, and analyzes the present-day de- 
mand made by the manufacturer, by organized labor, by the educator, 
and by the social worker. In addition he outlines a constructive plan 
on which this type of education might be organized by public schools 
and brought into vital relation with the present system. 
The book contains descriptions and interpretations of existing 
examples of public industrial schools or classes which have been 
established in the United States during the past six or seven years. 
Emphasis is placed on the value of the illustrative, concrete example 
rather than upon the underlying theory, but an attempt is made to 
establish some general principles, by which these examples may be 
classified. 
Consideration is given to some closely related movements such as 
the observed tendency to reorganize school systems on a more logical 
and psychological basis, especially as regards grading and promotion 
of pupils; the differentiation of elementary and secondary education ; 
agricultural education ; vocational guidance; and state legislation. 
The book is appropriate for use in reading circles, for students of 
education, and for senior college and graduate students generally.

FINE AND INDUSTRIAL ARTS IN 
ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS 
By WALTER SARGENT, Professor of Aisthetic and Industrial Education, 
The University of Chicago 
8vo, cloth, 132 pages, illustrated, 75 cents 
HIS book is a study of the place which the various 
phases of fine and industrial arts should occupy in the 
elementary-school curriculum. 
It discusses the educational aims and significance of draw- 
ing, manual training, and design; the practical values of each 
of these subjects and their relation to industrial education; a 
plan for coherent progression through the grades in each; 
and the general nature of the work suitable for successive 
periods of the school course — offering suggestions for spe- 
cific problems and a discussion of the standards of attain- 
ment which may reasonably be expected at each stage of 
the work. The various subjects are adequately illustrated 
with drawings, and with photographic reproductions of the 
work of children. 
The book is planned te give information and assistance to 
grade teachers whose regular work includes instruction in the 
arts; to special teachers who are looking for suggestions use- 
ful in the arrangement of courses; and to superintendents who 
wish a discussion of the function of the fine and industrial arts 
in elementary schools.

HISTORY OF MODERN 
ELEMENTARY EDUCATION 
By SAMUEL CHESTER PARKER 
Dean of the College of Education, The University of Chicago 
8vo, cloth, xxiv-+ 505 pages, illustrated, $1.50 
Tuts book provides a continuous, connected history of ele- 
       entary education, from the first vernacular schools of medieval 
cities to the present, which will contribute directly to the student’s 
understanding of the problems of the elementary school. The 
subject is treated under three main topics — social conditions, 
; educational theory, and school practice. The balance of attention 
devoted to each topic is carefully preserved, and the relation of 
each to historical development clearly traced. 
The author shows in a concrete way how elementary schools 
have changed to meet changing social conditions such as the 
growth of vernacular literatures, of cities, of modern science, of 
national governments, and of democracy. He traces the changes 
» which have been made in the elementary curriculum, and shows 
how the methods of teaching various subjects have been 
influenced by Rousseau, Pestalozzi, Herbart, Froebel, Colonel 
Parker, Dewey, and other prominent educational reformers. 
Two thirds of the book are devoted to developments since 
the publication of Rousseau’s “ Emile” in 1762.

back to country life. It contains much helpful and easily accessible 
information for the organization of recreation in the rural home, 
in the rural |school, and in the rural community.

tage of the freedom which that life affords. He shows practical ways 
of interesting the farm child through farm topics. Some of the 
chapter titles aie: Outdoor Art— Beautifying School Grounds, Indoor 
Art and Decoiation, A Farmer Boys’ Experiment Club, The Coun- 
try School anil the Farmers’ Institute, The Training of Teachers

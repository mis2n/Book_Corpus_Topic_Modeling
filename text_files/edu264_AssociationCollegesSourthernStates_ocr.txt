Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools 
of the Southern States 
ORIGIN AND PURPOSE OF THE ASSOCIATION 
The Association was organized in the autumn of 1895 at Atlanta, Georgia, 
at a meeting of delegates from a number of southern colleges and universities. 
Invitations to this meeting had been sent out by a committee appointed by the 
faculty of Vanderbilt University. The purpose of the meeting, as stated, was: 
1. To organize southern schools and colleges for cooperation and mutual 
assistance. 
2. To elevate the standard of scholarship and to effect uniformity of en- 
trance requirements. 
3. To develop preparatory schools and cut off this work from the colleges. 
On this basis an organization was effected and a constitution and by-laws 
were adopted. The following institutions were the charter members: Van- 
derbilt University, University of North Carolina, University of the South, 
University of Mississippi, Washington and Lee University, Trinity College. 
Chancellor J. H. Kirkland was the first Secretary and Treasurer and served 
in this capacity until 1908, when the late Professor Frederick W. Moore 
became Secretary and Treasurer, serving until his death in 1911. Since that 
time this office has been filled by the following: Bert E. Young, 1911-1915; 
Walter Hullihen, 1915-1917; Edward A. Bechtel, 1917-1921; Edwin D. Pusey, 
1921-1923; Theodore H. Jack, 1923-. 
The aims and standards of the Association are set forth in its Constitution 
and By-Laws, printed in Part VII of this volume.

REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE 
President W. W. Guth, Goucher College, was recognized to pre- 
sent a report from the Executive Committee of the Association on the 
Centre College case. President Guth, before reading the report, 
made the following statement: 
Mr. President and Members of the Association: The Executive Committee 
has as its first report a report on the matter referred to it last year concerning 
Centre College.  
-P-A-G-E-40
  40 Proceedings of the Association of Colleges and 
I have been asked to present the report this morning on behalf of the 
Executive Committee. Before doing so I want briefly to recall the proceed- 
ings that brought the case of Centre College before the Executive Committee. 
You will remember that last year the Commission on Institutions of Higher 
Education made its report to the Executive Committee and the Executive 
Committee, acting upon that report, reported to you that Centre College 
should be dropped from the roll of membership. The President of Centre 
College appealed from that decision from the floor. After discussion that 
appeal was referred to the Executive Committee; the Executive Committee 
having jurisdiction in the matter. The Executive Committee, last year, in 
response to this motion asked the Association to give it full authority in two 
particulars,—I am reading from page 37 of the proceedings,—full authority in 
two particulars; first, to conduct this investigation, that is a personal investi- 
gation at Centre College and as far afield 2s the Committee felt it ought to 
go, and second, full authority to bring in its report at the next meeting of the 
Association. The motion of Dr. Buchner as well as the request of the Execu- 
tive Committee, was based on Article 3 of our By-Laws, the first sentence of 
which reads: 
“The Executive Committee of the Association shall hear and deter- 
mine the appeals, if any, against the findings of the Commission.” 
The Executive Committee assumed that it had uot only full authority in the 
premises, but a duty to hear and determine the matter relating to Centre 
College. 
Now, in regard to the word “determine,”—very happily this word was de- 
fined for us when the constitution and by-laws were adopted in 1921. I call 
your attention to the proceedings of 1921, at page 32. 
“Dean W. G. Battle, of the University of Texas, moved an amend- 
ment to article 3 providing that the Executive Committee should hear 
appeals and report to the Association, without any authority to de- 
termine these appeals. The question was discussed by Dr. Blackwell, 
of Randolph-Macon, Dr. Conradi, of the Florida State College for 
Women, Dr. Guth, of Goucher College, and others. The amendment 
was put to vote by institutions and was lost. 
The amendment to the article, as we have it now in our by-laws was adopted. 
I am making this preliminary statement for the purpose of explaining the 
position of the Executive Committee. We do not desire, in any sense, to 
assume authority beyond our rights; we had a very difficult problem to han- 
dle; we went at it conscientiously and earnestly; we spent a very great deal 
of time on the matter during this past year; and particularly at this present 
Association we gave up hours to the hearing and discussion of the whole 
problem. We have brought in a final report, determining the matter as we 
thought it was our office so to do. There may be a difference of opinion 
among the members of the Association. We, of course, respect that difference 
of opinion. I merely want to say that we are not trying to bring in a report 
usurping any authority, or seemingly taking the matter out of the hands of
-P-A-G-E-41
Secondary Schools of the Southern States 41 
the Association. It is the report of the Executive Committee made accord- 
ing to their best wisdom and judgment. The report, therefore, follows: 
At the last meeting of the Association, the Commission on Institu- 
tions of Higher Education reported to the Executive Committee that 
Centre College had failed to satisfy said Commission that it was 
meeting the requirements of the Association, particularly in athletic 
matters. This report was conveyed by the Executive Committee to 
the Association and the President of Centre College appealed from 
this decision of the Commission: whereupon, in accord with By-law 3, 
the Executive Committee was instructed by vote of the Association to 
take original jurisdiction in the case and make a further investigation 
of Centre College. 
The Executive Committee appointed a Sub-Committee of three, con- 
sisting of President Guth, President Chase, and President Key, to visit 
Centre College and in its own way and at its own discretion to study 
the problem presented. This Sub-Committee presented its report to 
the Executive Committee at its first meeting held Tuesday, December 
2, and the Executive Committee after careful consideration reached 
the following conclusions: 
1. That the Commission on Institutions ‘of Higher Education acted 
properly in failing to recommend Centre College be placed on the 
approved list, inasmuch as said Committee was not satisfied that 
Centre College was meeting the standards of the Association. 
2. The investigation made by the Executive Committee convinces that 
Committee that the authorities of Centre College are now in accord 
with the ideals of this Association and are endeavoring to enforce 
our standards. The records of the College have been inspected at 
the institution, changes have been made in the management of 
athletics, assurances have been given of cooperation with the 
Association in the policies of the college. The grounds for past 
action do not exist at present. 
Because of these conclusions the Executive Committee has voted 
that Centre College be and the same is hereby placed on the list of 
approved institutions. 
Signed: 
Tueopore H. Jack, Secretary. 
The President, on behalf of the Association, thanked the Executive 
Committee for its work, and referred the report to the Secretary 
for record. 
REPORT OF COMMISSION ON INSTITUTIONS OF 
HIGHER EDUCATION 
The chair then called for the report of the Commission on Insti- 
tutions of Higher Education. The Chairman of the Commission,
-P-A-G-E-42
    42 Proceedings of the Association of Colleges and 
Dean H. D. Campbell, Washington and Lee University, presented 
the report of the Commission which will be found in Part III. On 
motion of Superintendent R. H. Watkins, Laurel High School, 
Laurel, Mississippi, the report was adopted by vote of the Asso- 
ciation. 
With reference to the list of non-member colleges whose graduates 
are approved as teachers in the accredited schools of the Associa- 
tion, Superintendent Omer Carmichael, Selma, Alabama, raised the 
question of policy for the year 1924-25, and Dean Campbell, the 
Chairman of the Commission, stated that the list previously in use 
would be in force until the next meeting of the Association. 
ADDRESS OF PROFESSOR PARKINSON 
Professor B. L. Parkinson, Director of the Extension Division, 
University of South Carolina, addressed the Association on “Exten- 
sion Service of Southern Colleges.” This address will be found 
in Part V. 
A large basket of beautiful flowers was presented to the Presi- 
dent of the Association by the Superintendent and the Board of 
Education of the Shelby County Schools, and the President ex- 
pressed his thanks and the thanks of the Association for this cour- 
tesy. 
RECEPTION OF FRATERNAL DELEGATE 
The Association was delighted to welcome, as the fraternal dele- 
gate from the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary 
Schools, Dr. C. O. Davis, of the University of Michigan, the secre- 
tary of the North Central’s Commission on Secondary Schools. 
Dr. Davis sat with the two Commissions of our Association in their 
meetings preliminary to the general sessions, and many of the 
members were thus enabled to know him personally. His cordiality 
and sympathetic interest made him a very welcome fraternal dele- 
gate from our sister organization. During the morning session, Dr. 
Davis was formally presented to the Association and made a very 
happy and thoughtful talk on the common problems of the two 
Associations. An interesting ‘suggestion’ was on the possibility of 
a joint meeting of the two Associations in some border city, in 
order that those working on common problems might come to know 
one another better.

in connection with the American College Association, of the Na- 
tional Committee on Standards. He pointed out that the National 
 
-P-A-G-E-46
46 Proceedings of the Association of Colleges and 
Committee had drawn up standards for four-year colleges and for 
junior colleges which had become the bases for the standards of 
our Association for these groups as well as standards for teacher- 
training institutions. The National Committee is now working on 
the question of units and on that of nomenclature. The belief was 
expressed in a general way, that perhaps one-third of the money, 
the time, and the labor of colleges is dissipated in efforts to educate 
and deal with a group that should not be there at all. Not that the 
services of the college are not of some value to that group, but that 
colleges were not founded to perform the function either of reform 
schools or of helping the feeble-minded. 
REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE 
The Executive Committee recommended for membership in the 
Association the following institutions of higher education: 
The Citadel, Charleston, South Carolina. 
Furman University, Greenville, South Carolina. 
Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas, College Station, Texas. 
On motion, the vote of the Association was cast for these insti- 
tutions, and they were declared elected to membership. 
On the recommendation of the Executive Committee, 273 accred- 
ited secondary schools, recommended by the Commission on Sec- 
ondary Schools, were elected to membership in the Association. 
The list of new member schools will be found in the membership 
roll, beginning at page 15. 
The Executive Committee nominated the following for individual 
membership: 
Thomas E. Stritch, S. J., Superintendent of Southern Jesuit Colleges and 
Schools. 
J. P. MacMillan, Assistant Secretary, Board of Education, Methodist Episco- 
pel Church, New York. 
On motion, the vote of the Association was cast for these nomi- 
nees and they were declared elected to individual membership in 
the Association. 
REPORT OF THE AUDITING COMMITTEE 
The report of the Auditing Committee was presented, as follows:

INVITATIONS 
Invitations were formally extended to the Association to meet, 
in 1925, in Jacksonville, Florida, and in Charleston, South Carolina. 
The acceptance of the invitation from Jacksonville was urged by 
President Murphree, University of Florida, and that from Charles- 
ton by Professor Graeser, College of Charleston. President Key, 
Millsaps College, presented an invitation from Jackson, Mississippi, 
asking that the Association meet in that city in 1926, and this 
invitation was seconded by President Provine, Mississippi College, 
and Miss Nellie S. Keirn, Mississippi State College for Women. 
Since the determination of the place of meeting is in the hands of 
the Executive Committee, these invitations were referred to that 
Committee.

RESOLVED: That the Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools of 
the Southern States expresses its gratitude to its faithful officers and commit- 
tees and to those of the two commissions whose generously expended efforts 
have made our twenty-ninth annual meeting a success; to the management 
of the Hotel Chisca whose ample facilities have contributed to our pleasure

E. J. MATHEWS, 
J. HENRY HIGHSMITH, 
GOODRICH C. WHITE. 
On motion, the resolutions as read were adopted by a rising vote. 
There being no further business, the Association adjourned. 
Following adjournment, the members of the Association were the 
guests of the Shelby County Board of Education at a delightful 
luncheon at the Southside High School. During the luncheon, brief 
talks were made by Hon. Rowlett Paine, Mayor of Memphis, Super- 
intendent R. L. Jones, of the Memphis City Schools, and Dean 
Baker, the retiring President of the Association. 
Through the courtesy of the Memphis Chamber of Commerce, 
the delegates were then taken for a drive around Memphis, thus 
bringing to a conclusion the twenty-ninth annual meeting of the 
Association.

STANDARDS FOR COLLEGES 
Standard Number 1. Entrance Requirements. The requirement for admis- 
sion shall be the satisfactory completion of a four-year course of not less than 
fifteen units in a secondary school approved by a recognized accrediting 
agency, or in a secondary school that is a member of this Association, or the 
equivalent of such a course as shown by examination. The major portion of 
the secondary school course accepted for admission should be definitely cor- 
related with the curriculum to which the student is admitted. Any college 
of this Association may be called upon at any time for a record of all the 
students entering the freshman class, such record to contain the name of each 
student, his secondary school, method of admission, units offered in each 
subject, and total units accepted. 
Standard Number 2. Requirements for Graduation. The college should 
demand for graduation the completion of a minimum quantitative requirement 
of one hundred and twenty semester hours of credit (or the equivalent in 
term hours, quarter hours, points, majors or courses), with further scholastic 
qualitative requirements adapted by each institution to its conditions. 
 
-P-A-G-E-51
  Secondary Schools of the Southern States 
Standard Number 3.. Number of Degrees. The conferring of a mult 
of degrees is discouraged. Small institutions should confine themselves 
or two. When more than one baccalaureate degree is offered, all show 
equal in requirements for admission and for graduation. Institutions of lin. 
resources and inadequate facilities for graduate work should confine them- 
selves to strictly undergraduate courses. 
Standard Number 4. Number of College Departments. A college of arts 
and sciences of approximately one hundred students should maintain at least 
eight separate departments, with at least one professor devoting his whole 
time to each department. The size of the faculty should bear a definite rela- 
tion to the type of institution, the number of students, and the number of 
courses offered. With the growth of the student body the number of full- 
time teachers should be correspondingly increased. The development of varied 
curricula should involve the addition of other heads of departments. 
Standard Number 5.. Training of Faculty. The training of the members 
of the faculty of professorial rank should include at least two years of study 
in their respective fields of teaching in a fully organized and recognized grad- _ 
uate school. The training of the head of a department should be equivalent 
to that required for the doctor’s degree or should. ‘Yepresent a corresponding 
professional or technical training. A college will be judged in large part by 
the ratio which the number of persons of professorial rank with sound training, 
scholarly achievement and successful experience as teachers bears to the total 
number of the teaching staff. Honorary degrees are not recognized as a quali- 
fication for teachers. 
Standard Number 6. Salaries. The average salary paid members of the 
faculties is an important consideration in determining the standing of an 
institution. It is recommended that the salary of full professors be not less 
than $2,500 at present, and by 1923-24 not less than $3,000. The local cost 
of living and other factors shall be taken into consideration. 
Standard Number 7. Number of Class-Room Hours for Teachers. Teach- 
ing schedules exceeding sixteen hours per week per instructor shall be inter- 
preted as endangering educational efficiency. In general, two laboratory hours 
will be counted as equivalent to one recitation hour. 
Standard Number 8. Number of Students in Classes. Classes (exclusive of 
lectures) of more than thirty students shall be interpreted as endangering 
educational efficiency. 
Standard Number 9. Support. The college should have an annual income 
of not less than $50,000, and if not tax supported, an endowment of not less 
than $500,000. The financial status of the college should be, however, judged 
in relation to its educational program. 
Standard Number 10. Library. The college should have a live, well dis- 
tributed, professionally administered library of at least 8,000 volumes, exclu- 
sive of public documents, bearing specifically upon the subjects taught and
-P-A-G-E-52
52 Proceedings of the Association of Colleges and 
  with a definite annual appropriating for the purchase of new books in keeping 
with the curriculum. 
Standard Number 11. Laboratories. The laboratory equipment shall be 
adequate for all the experiments called for by the courses offered in the 
sciences, and these facilities shall be kept up by means of an annual appro- 
priation in keeping with the curriculum. 
Standard Number 12. Separation of College and Preparatory School. The 
college may not maintain a preparatory school as part of its college organi- 
zation. In case such a school is maintained under the college charter it must 
be kept rigidly distinct and separate from the college in students, faculty, 
buildings, and discipline. 
Standard Number 13. Proportion of Regular College Students to the Whole 
Student Body. At least seventy-five per cent of the students in a college should 
be pursuing courses leading to baccalaureate degrees in arts and science. 
Soldier rehabilitation students should not be considered in the twenty-five per 
cent of irregular and special students at present. 
Standard Number 14. General Statement Concerning Material Equipment. 
The location and construction of the buildings, the lighting, heating, and 
yentilation of the rooms, the nature of the laboratories, corridors, closets, 
water supply, school furniture, apparatus, and methods of cleaning shall be 
such as to insure hygienic conditions for both students and teachers. 
Standard Number 15. General Statement Concerning Curriculum and Spirit 
of Administration. The character of the curriculum, efficiency of instruction, 
the scientific spirit, the soundness of scholarship, the standard for regular de- 
grees, the conservation in granting honorary degrees, the character of its 
publicity, and the tone of the institution, shall also be factors in determining 
its standing. The curriculum should provide both for breadth of study and 
for concentration. It should have justifiable relation to the resources of the 
institution. 
Standard Number 16. Extra Curricular Activities. The proper administra- 
tion of athletics, amusements, fraternities, and all other extra curricular activi- 
ties, is one of the fundamental tests of a standard college. 
Athletics. The college members of the Association will be expected to make 
regular reports on their supervision of athletics, showing that the latter are 
on a clean and healthy basis, that they do not occupy an undue place in the 
life of the college, and that strict eligibility and scholarship requirements are 
enforced. Professionalism or commercialism in athletics shall disqualify a 
college from membership in the approved list of the Association, and no 
college that places its chief emphasis upon intercollegiate athletics to the 
detriment of its scholarship will be placed on the approved list. 
Standard Number 17. Standing in the Educational World. The institution 
must be able to prepare its students to enter recognized graduate, professional, 
or research institutions as candidates for advanced degrees. In evidence sta- 
tistics of the records of the graduates of the college in graduate or professional
-P-A-G-E-53
Secondary Schools of the Southern States 53 
schools shall be filed with the Commission on Institutions of Higher Education 
on demand. 
Standard Number 18. Professional and Technical Departments. When the 
institution has in addition to the college of arts and science professional or 
technical departments, the college of arts and science shall not be accepted 
for the approved list of the Association unless the professional or technical 
departments are of approved grade, national standards being used when 
available. 
Standard Number 19. - Inspection. No college will be recommended for 
membership until it has been inspected and reported upon by an agent or 
agents regularly appointed by the Commission. Any college of the Associa- 
tion shall be open to inspection at any time. 
Standard Number 20. Filing of Blank. No institution shall be placed or 
retained on the approved list unless a regular information blank has been 
filed with the Commission. The list shall be approved from year to year by 2 
the Commission. The blank shall be filed triennially, but the Commission 
may for due cause call upon any member to file a new report in the meantime. 
Failure to file the blank shall be cause for dropping an institution.

The annual meeting of the Commission was held at the Chisca Hotel, Mem- 
phis, Tennessee, December 2-4, 1924. 
The Commission assembled at 11 a. m., Chairman H. D. Campbell presid- 
ing. The following members were in attendance upon the sessions of the 
Commission: 
Alabama: C. H. Barnwell, J. T. Wright, Chas. A. Brown

Texas: W. J. Battle, W. A. James 
Virginia: H. D. Campbell, Emily Dutton (representing E. W. McVea) 
West Virginia: F. B. Trotter 
The Minutes of the Commission for the previous meeting as published in the 
Proceedings of the Association were approved. 
A brief report was made by the Chairman of the Commission, and the 
names of the institutions applying for admission to the Association were 
read for the information of the Commission. 
On motion the Chairman appointed a Committee of three to formulate and 
report to the Commission rules to be adopted in the case of four-year, non- 
member colleges. 
The Chairman appointed four regional committees to consider applications 
of institutions desiring admission into the Association. 
Resolved that an institution of higher education which is admitted to mem- 
bership shall be admitted for a period of two years only; that at the end of 
two years the institution shall be considered again and must be approved at 
that time before being finally approved for membership. 
As a substitute for the above it was moved that the resolution be adopted 
in principle and referred to the Council for phrasing and placement. This 
motion was adopted. 
Discussion of Standard Number 9, Support: 
The motion prevailed that Regional Committees refer each individual case 
to the Commission for its action. The following resolution was then adopted: 
It is the sense of this Commission that in lieu of a part of the revenue from 
an endowment of five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000), the committees 
may recommend -that a revenue of not more than ten thousand ; dollars  
-P-A-G-E-58
  58 Proceedings of the Association of Colleges and 
($10,000) per annum guaranteed by responsible church bodies may for the 
time being be substituted. 
Discussion of Standard Number 6, Salaries: 
The following resolution prevailed with reference to this standard, That it 
be the sense of this Commission that this standard be so interpreted as to 
mean that the salary of $3,000 be for nine months and not for eleven. 
The discussion of A. and M. Colleges was taken up and it was voted: 
That final action upon colleges of this type be postponed until the commit- 
tee appointed for this purpose reports at the next meeting of the Association, 
but that meanwhile A. and M. Colleges “as such” may be admitted to the 
Association upon recommendation of the Commission in case their academic 
departments conform to the standards of the Association. 
No final action was taken by the Commission with reference to the admis- 
sion of Teachers Colleges, and the matter was referred to the committee ap- 
pointed to report on these institutions. 
Members of the Commission were instructed to send proposed changes in 
the application blank to the Secretary of the Commission. It was further 
voted to authorize such changes as were approved by the Council. 
The following institutions were recommended for membership in the Asso- 
ciation: 
The Citadel, Charleston, South Carolina. 
Furman University, Greenville, South Carolina. 
Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas, College Station, Texas. 
The report of the committee on the Four-Year Colleges was then sub- 
mitted. It was discussed in detail and adopted with certain modifications. 
The report as adopted follows: 
Your Committee has not been able in the limited time at its disposal to 
prepare in detail proposals for dealing with institutions which approximate 
but do not meet our standards. It is recognized, however, that member col- 
leges of the Association cannot at the present time furnish from their grad- 
uates enough teachers to supply the needs of the All-Southern-High-Schools. 
Therefore, a special category must be continued. 
We would recommend with regard to colleges to be included in this cate- 
gory: 
1. That the names of such colleges be published in the proceedings of this 
Association in a list under the following caption: “The graduates of 
the following NON-MEMBER COLLEGES may be selected as teachers 
by the accredited secondary schools of this Association.” This list shall 
be sent to the State High School inspectors. 
2. That these colleges shall meet certain specified standards as high as 
may be deemed practicable and approximating the standards for mem- 
ber colleges. 
3. That colleges shall not be considered for enrollment on this list, unless 
they have been inspected by a representative of this Commission, and 
have filed the report blanks furnished by the Commission. 
 
-P-A-G-E-59
Secondary Schools of the Southern States 59 
4. That the necessary Committee or Committees be appointed by the Com- 
mission for passing upon the reports and recommendations and prepar- 
ing the list, which list shall receive the final approval of the Executive 
Council of this Commission and of the Executive Committee of the As- 
sociation. 
5. That such a list be prepared and published at our next meeting, shall 
hold for two years, and shall be prepared biennially thereafter. 
Nominations to fill vacancies in the Commission were then made through 
the chairman of the Nominating Committee appointed for this purpose. These 
nominations were approved by the Commission, and reported to the Executive 
Committee of the Association. The names appear under caption “Class of 
1927.” 
On motion the Chairman of the Commission for 1924 was chosen to act as 
temporary Chairman when the Commission shall have been called together to 
elect officers for 1925. 
On motion the Council was authorized to provide blanks for Junior Colleges. 
It was voted by the Executive Committee of the Association that the Com- 
mission on Institutions of Higher Education be requested to include with its 
questionnaire on Standards a questionnaire similar to that heretofore used by 
the Committee on Athletics, and that the Commission require member col- 
leges and colleges applying for membership to submit this questionnaire on 
athletics with their other papers. 
On motion it was voted that a fee of $50.00 be charged for inspection of a 
college, and that this money be forwarded to the Treasurer of the Association 
before the inspection is made. 
The following resolution was adopted: That it be the sense of this Com- 
mission that colleges now on the list of Non-Member Colleges be considered 
as having applied for a place on this list for the following year. 
The Commission of 1924 then adjourned. 
Upon the call of the acting Chairman, Dean Campbell, the Commission for 
1925 was convened for the purpose of electing officers. The following officers

THE COMMISSION AND ITS STANDARDS OF ACCREDITING 
ARTICLE 1. 
There shall be a commission which shall consist of the High School Inspec- 
tor in such states as provide one, and in addition, three members selected from 
each state within the territory of the Associaton. One of these members 
shall be elected from the state university, the Professor of Secondary Education 
wherever practicable; another member shall be a representative of some other 
college belonging to the Association; and the third member shall be connected 
with some secondary school accredited by the Association. These three mem- 
bers shall be elected by the Association on nomination of the Executive Com- 
mittee. The term of all members shall be for three years, or until their 
successors are appointed. The elections shall be so ordered that one-third 
of the membership shall be appointed each year. 
ARTICLE 2. 
It shall be the duty of the Commission to agree upon a uniform blank for 
reports of high school principals, relative to organization, teaching force, at- 
tendance, library, laboratory, and other equipment. 
ARTICLE 3. 
This Commission shall also prepare a uniform certificate blank for admis- 
sion to college, which may be used by all members of the Association. 
ARTICLE 4. 
The Commission shall describe and define unit courses of study in the 
various secondary school programs, based on the recommendations of the
-P-A-G-E-66
  66 Proceedings of the Association of Colleges and 
Carnegie Foundation and the rules of the Association as herein prescribed. 
The minimum standard for accrediting shall be: 
(a) No school shall be accredited which does not require for graduation the 
completion of a four-year high school course of study embracing sixteen units 
as defined by this Association. A unit represents a year’s study in any sub- 
ject in a secondary school constituting approximately a quarter of a full 
year’s work. More than twenty periods per week should be discouraged. 
(b) The minimum scholastic attainment required of the faculty of any 
accredited secondary school on the Southern List is, that not less than 75 per 
cent of the total number of teachers of academic subjects, including the prin- 
cipal, teachers of Agriculture and Home Economics, shall hold bachelors de- 
grees, or the equivalent, from a college approved by the Association. Teachers 
should have had professional training or at least one year’s experience in 
teaching. 
(c) The maximum teaching load of any teacher shall be 750 pupil-periods 
per week with not more than five daily recitations. The Commission will 
scrutinize with extreme care any school in which instructors teach as many as 
six daily periods. In interpretting this standard a double period in laboratory, 
shop, or two periods of study-room supervision shall be counted as the equiva- 
lent of one recitation period. 
(d) The laboratory and library facilities shall be adequate for the needs of 
instruction in the courses taught. The library should have 500\ volumes ex- 
clusive of duplicates and government publications. 
(e) The location and construction of the buildings, the lighting, heating and 
ventilation of the rooms, the nature of the lavatories, corridors, water supply, 
school furniture, apparatus, and methods of cleaning shall be such as to 
insure hygienic conditions for both pupils and teachers. 
(f) The efficiency of instruction, the acquired habits of thought and speech, 
the general intellectual and moral tone of a school are paramount factors; 
and, therefore, only schools which rank well in these particulars, as evidenced 
by rigid, thorough-going, systematic inspection, shall be considered eligible 
for the list. 
(g) The Commission will decline to consider any school whose teaching 
force consists of fewer than four teachers giving their full time to high school 
instruction. When local conditions warrant the introduction of vocational 
subjects, such as agriculture, manual training, household arts, and commercial 
subjects, the Commission will hold that a sufficient number of teachers must 
be employed and proper equipment added to provide adequately for such 
instruction. 
(h) No school shall be considered unless the regular annual blank furnished 
for the purpose shall have been filled out and placed on file with the inspector. 
In case of schools having twelve or more teachers, a complete report on teachers 
once in three years will be sufficient, but full data relative to changes must 
be presented annually. 
(i) All schools whose records show an excessive number of pupils per 
teacher, as based on the average number belonging, even though they may 
 
-P-A-G-E-67
  Secondary Schools of the Southern States 67 
technically meet all other requirements, will be rejected. The Association 
recognizes thirty as a maximum. 
(j) The time for which schools are accredited shall be limited to one year, 
dating from the time of the adoption of the list by the Association. In every 
case the character of the work done by a school must be the determining factor 
in accrediting. By personal visits of the inspectors, by detailed reports from 
the principal, and by the records made by the students in colleges, the char- 
acter of a school’s work shall be, from time to time, determined. A ‘school 
shall be removed from the accredited list for failure to maintain the above 
standards. 
(k) The Commission recommends $1000 as the minimum salary for teachers. 
ARTICLE 5. 
Each State Committee shall prepare a list of accredited schools of its state 
according to the prescribed regulations and furnish the same to the Commission 
at its appointed annual meeting. 
ARTICLE 6. 
From the lists thus submitted the Commission shall, at its annual meeting, 
select the schools which shall constitute the Southern List of Accredited 
Schools. Copies of this list when made up shall be furnished to the members 
of the Association before May 1 of each year. 
ARTICLE 7. 
Colleges belonging to the Association shall report to the professor of sec- 
ondary education or high school inspector by February 15th of each year any 
causes of lack of preparation of, or other information relating to, students 
coming from schools in his state, on blanks prepared by the Commission. 
These reports, after having been reviewed by the representatives of the Com- 
mission in the state, shall be forwarded by the above officer in tabulated form 
to the schools interested and also laid before the Commission. 
ARTICLE 8. 
The Deans’ Report shall be taken into consideration in warning schools. 
ARTICLE 9. 
All secondary schools that are members of the Association shall pay annual 
dues of five dollars; all others shall pay two dollars per year accreditation fees. 
ArticLe 10. 
Schools on the Southern List must be in the highest class of schools as 
officially listed by the proper authorities of the state. 
MINUTES OF THE COMMISSION ON SECONDARY SCHOOLS, 
DECEMBER, 1924 
The Commission on Secondary Schools has been in continuous 
session for the past two days, December 2 and 3. A very large 
percent of all members have been in attendance. Many friends in 
the field of secondary education have been with us and have been 
given a most hearty welcome.

  70 Proceedings of the Association of Colleges and 
In order to get the principals more into the spirit of the workings of the 
Association, an effort was made to get more of them to pay the five dollar 
membership fee and get the Volume of Proceedings and all other reading mat- 
ter sent out by the organization. There were already 209 secondary school 
members and to these were added an additional 274, making a total of 483 
in all. Your Commission feels that this is a very fine professional move and 
one to be commended. A full list of these schools will be found in Division 
III of this report.

INTERPRETATION OF STANDARDS 
I. A nine months term was interpreted to mean 175 school days, 
including holidays. 
II. The minimum salary requirement for teachers was raised 
from $900 to $1,000 per year. 
Ill. Article IV, (g), of the standards was interpreted to mean 
that there must be a minimum of 16 recitations per day. 
IV. Article VIII was discussed. The question was raised whether 
a school could be dropped from the list without having first been 
warned. The Commission ruled that it is not necessary to warn a 
school before dropping it, in case the conditions warrant such 
action. 
V. Batesville, Arkansas, High School was denied accreditation. 
The Commission enacted the State Unit Rule, which excludes from 
Association membership individual schools in a state where the 
state as a whole is not in the Association. Arkansas, formerly of 
the Southern Association, has withdrawn and gone into the North 
Central Association. 
OTHER MATTERS ACTED UPON 
1. The accrediting of high school music courses for college

(The above figures are based on a survey taken in 1922, representing 229 
colleges and universities throughout the U. S.; of these, 232 allowed entrance 
credits, 264 allowed music credits toward the B. A. degree.) 
After the Committee had presented its paper, the Chairman ap- 
pointed a special committee composed of J. S. Stewart, Chairman, 
W. L. Spencer, and J. H. Highsmith, to make a study of the Mem- 
orial and report its findings back to the Commission at a later date. 
The following revision of the Memorial, recommended by the com- 
mittee, was adopted by the Commission: 
Music educators in the South have been gratified at the liberal and progres- 
sive attitude of the Southern Association of Secondary Schools and Colleges, 
in regard to the recognition of the educational values of music. We find, 
however, considerable confusion in the application of the ruling which this 
Association made some years ago, when it recommended the acceptance of 
High School Music credits on college entrance requirements. This confusion 
is undoubtedly due to the fact that the Southern Association has not defined 
High School Music Credits and it is with recommendations for such definition 
that we address you on behalf of the Southern Conference for Music Educa- 
tion, whose territory and whose educational aims are identical with yours. 
We, therefore, urge your thoughtful consideration of the following proposi- 
tions, designed to define and restrict the accrediting of High School music 
and to secure the highest educational values of the subject.

2. The U. S. Bureau of Education as a National clearing house 
for research in Secondary Education. 
Dr. W. R. Smithey, Professor of Secondary Education, University 
of Virginia, was recognized by the Chairman. In a short discussion, 
Dr. Smithey outlined to the Commission the possibilities of having 
the U. S. Bureau of Education act as a co-ordinating agency for all 
the various organizations now at work in the field of secondary edu- 
cation. Dr. Smithey has given considerable time and attention to 
the development of this idea. At the close of his discussion he 
introduced Mr. E. E. Windes, Specialist in Rural Education, U. S.
-P-A-G-E-75
  Secondary Schools of the Southern States pe) 
Bureau of Education, who was present for the purpose of discussing 
the matter from the standpoint of the Bureau. Mr. Windes spoke as 
follows: 
THE U. S. BUREAU OF EDUCATION AS A NATIONAL CLEARING 
HOUSE FOR RESEARCH IN SECONDARY EDUCATION. 
I was assigned to secondary education in the division of rural education in 
the Bureau of Education in January, 1923. I immediately planned a compre- 
hensive study of the rural high school in the United States, and secured Dr. 
Ferriss, Professor of Secondary Education of the Rural Department of Cornell 
University, to cooperate in the study. As a phase of that study, I personally 
visited 23 State Departments of Education and selected high schools in the 
States represented by the State Departments. Dr. Ferriss visited 19 states 
similarly. Out of our experiences in that study and out of personal conver- 
sation with State Secondary officials; out of contacts with professors of sec- 
ondary education in colleges and universities and with superintendents in city 
and county secondary education surveys during the period I have worked at 
the job has come realization that there is universal demand for any definite 
need of a central agency to coordinate research and disseminate information 
concerning the results of research in the field of secondary education. This 
need is particularly acute in the field of the small high school. 
We have quite generally accepted the proposition that secondary education 
should be truly universal in the sense that all children of the age group 12 to 
18 should be served in the essential needs of life. This concept of secondary 
education has created problems in small high schools as yet unsolved. Satis- 
factory and early solution of these problems is an urgent need. More than 
50 per cent of the high schools enroll less than 50 pupils each. Efforts by 
such schools to administer secondary education according to the concept men- 
tioned with the type of internal organization exemplified in large comprehensive 
schools has resulted in per pupil costs well above $1,000. Per pupil costs 
above $400..00 are not at all unusual. Few communities can afford such costs. 
Few states where a majority of high schools are small high schools as in all 
agricultural states can maintain an effective system of secondary education 
according to this concept and organized in the traditional way. This appears 
from the fact that of the high schools of the states served by the Southern 
Association approximately 1 in 14 maintain such standards that this associa- 
tion will accredit them. This association is undoubtedly interested in the 
schools not now doing standard work. Certainly colleges and universities are 
interested in these schools from which a non-standard product is continually 
coming up for admission. The demands of these schools for financial support 
affect larger schools which now operate at reasonable costs. 
In every state in the union extensive effort at reorganization is under way. 
Endless experimentation, especially in the field of the curriculum, is under 
way. Workers have to venture conclusions on partial data. Many agencies 
are duplicating research on the basis of local data. An immediate union of 
the various agencies to coordinate research and disseminate information is 
 
-P-A-G-E-76
76 Proceedings of the Association of Colleges and 
sorely needed. Without such union progress will come but slowly. Millions 
will be spent on false starts which might be saved had we any definite progress 
to recommend. Even with larger means no single agency is now able to serve 
needed data. We are in the throes of an educational revolution which has to 
date been more provocative of chaos than progress. 
We are swamped with ideas and pupils while for guiding principles based 
on successful practice and for an educational product exhibiting measurable 
attainment in the fields of other than the traditional objectives we have little 
to offer. 
Such consideration supplemented by recent requests from interested men 
led me to draw up a tentative outline of the ways in which the Bureau of 
Education might render legitimate and worth while service in the field of 
secondary education. This outline which is here reproduced is being used 
to bring the matter of cooperation before the National Association of State 
High School Inspectors and Supervisors, the North Central Association, the 
Northwest Association and the New England Association, in addition to this 
association at the next meeting of the association concerned. 
OUTLINE 
A NATIONAL CLEARING HOUSE FOR SECONDARY EDUGATION 
1. The Bureau is willing to enter into definite cooperation with the various 
organizations interested in secondary education to the end that research in the 
field may be coordinated and information made widely available. 
2. Such cooperation might well involve for the Bureau of Education: 
(a) Serving as a repository of information in the way of raw data, made 
available through specific studies, theses of graduate students on secondary 
education topics and other special research studies made by any of the co- 
operating organization. Such information to be distributed by the Bureau in 
the way agreed upon as desirable by a committee representing the various 
organizations. 
(b) Collecting data or research studies authorized by any cooperating organi- 
zation. 
(c) Tabulate or assist in tabulating data on studies of general interest. 
(d) Undertake through its own personnel to make studies of general interest 
agreed upon by a committee representing the various organizations. 
(e) Publish each thesis or special study agreed upon as desirable by the 
Commissioner of Education and the organization through which the study was 
made. 
(f) Publish periodical lists of available data, theses or special studies for 
the information of members of the cooperating organization. 
3. Looking forward to the performance of such service it seems desirable 
that secondary education organization should appoint a representative, indi- 
vidual or committee, to agree with the Bureau of Education on the manner 
and extent of cooperation. A suggestion is that each organization place the 
executive secretaryship of a committee organized to initiate and direct research 
in secondary education in the person of the specialist assigned to secondary 
education in the Division of Rural Education, U. S. Bureau of Education.
-P-A-G-E-77
Secondary Schools of the Southern States 77 
This outline is of course only a suggestion. I have made an attempt to 
formulate more specific suggestions as the Bureau of Education desires to render 
the type of service desired by the agencies concerned in the manner that seems 
best to those agencies so long as the limitations under which the Bureau works 
are properly considered. 
I should make it clear that I have authority to speak only for the field of 
the small or rural high school. This involves State, county and other inter- 
mediate unit and local unit, other than city problems. 
I realize the desirability of dealing with secondary education as a unit, 
but the Bureau of Education operates under fixed limitations. One of these 
is the fact that its funds are made up in part from specific lump sum appro- 
priations. The division of rural education operates on such a fund. We 
cannot use such funds for aspects of secondary education that do not bear 
directly upon rural schools. Of course principles are common, methods are 
common, practices in city schools are significant for rural schools. The spe- 
cific limitation I must make is that I am not authorized to offer a blanket 
service for secondary education. Any active participation in studies affecting 
city high schools only and not made primarily in an effort to secure facts of 
significance to small or rural high schools, is not contemplated under this 
agreement. There is, however, no reason why this association, if it desires, 
should not request the Commissioner of Education to extend the service to the 
field of the city high school. Such services would involve the division of 
city schools for which I have no authority to speak. It would seem wise, 
however, to limit the undertaking at this time to the field of the small or rural 
high school. If this field can be developed satisfactorily the service can be 
extended to the whole field of secondary education at a later date. 
In view of the interest of educational agencies in the matter of the proper 
development of an official national agency, I wish to suggest at this time that 
the surest way to develop an adequate national agency to care for the problems 
of education is to demand service of the existing agency. Service demands 
upon established Federal agencies have invariably been the means of growth. 
Demands for service in the field of secondary education will result in adequate 
facilities for such service as is desired. 
An interesting discussion followed the presentation of the paper. 
It was evident that there was much interest manifested in the pos- 
sibilities of this proposition. A motion was made from the floor 
and carried that the Chair appoint Messrs. Smithey, Ligon, and 
Spencer as a committee of three to study this problem further and 
to act for the Commission in working the matter out with the au- 
thorities of the U. S. Bureau of Education. 
3. Committees on program of ‘studies. 
A motion was passed authorizing the Chairman to appoint a 
series of committees on the various subjects of the high school cur- 
 
-P-A-G-E-78
78 Proceedings of the Association of Colleges and 
riculum; the chairmen of the various committees to constitute a 
special committee on course of study. It is the desire of the Com- 
mission that we launch out into a careful study of the various sub- 
jects of our curriculum, and that at least one or more reports be 
made at each annual meeting by these committees. The personnel 
of these committees is to be found on page 17 of the Proceedings. 
4. Machinery for reviewing blanks. 
At present the Commission breaks up into as many committees 
as there are states. Each committee is headed by the Chairman of 
the State Committee, which handles the blanks for that state. 
These committees usually spend from two to four hours reviewing 
carefully the schools of the various states. 
All schools that are of a serious nature are handled by an Equity 
Committee, appointed especially for the task. When any reviewing 
committee does not desire to assume responsibility in passing upon 
a school it turns the school in question over to the Equity Committee 
for final decision. 
The machinery of the Commission in brief is as follows: 
(1) All blanks in a state are passed upon by the State Committee 
composed of four members. 
(2) All blanks are then passed upon by a reviewing committee 
composed, with the exception of the Chairman, of members outside 
of that particular state. 
(3) An Equity Committee handles all doubtful cases and insures 
absolute justice to all schools. 
There was a feeling among several of the members that the Com- 
mission should consider the advisability of reorganizing the method 
and machinery of the Commission for this work. The Fraternal 
Delegate from the North Central Association, Dr. C. O. Davis of 
the University of Michigan, was asked to discuss this matter in the 
light of the experience of the North Central Association. Dr. Davis 
is Secretary to the Commission on Accredited Secondary Schools of 
‘that Association. In commenting upon our work, Dr. Davis pointed 
out the fact that we handled the task much more expeditiously than 
they did, and commended very highly the working of the Equity 
Committee. He pointed out, however, the danger of a lack of uni- 
formity of procedure and of application of standards due to the 
fact that we have twelve separate committees reviewing schools. In 
 
-P-A-G-E-79
  Secondary Schools of the Southern States 79 
his discussion he compared the workings of the North Central Com- 
mission with this Commission in a very elucidating manner. Accord- 
ing to Dr. Davis, the North Central Commission operates under four 
committees as follows: 
(1) Committee on Schools recommended unqualifiedly. 
(2) Committee on Schools to be warned. 
(3) Committee on Schools to be advised. 
(4) Committee on New Schools. 
5. Financial statement of the Commission. 
One year ago the Commission requested the privilege of operat- 
ing under a budget. It was the feeling of the Commission that 
efficiency would result from such action. Since the budget idea was 
new, the Commission requested the privilege of operating one year 
upon as economical a basis as possible, and reporting back the 
result of its experience. Below is the budget as allowed, also the 
amounts expended by the Secretary. Attention is called to the fact 
that at the close of the year’s business the Commission lacked 
$131.91 spending the amount allowed for its year’s work.

6. Investigation of Athletics in Secondary Schools and Normal 
Schools. 
Acting under the instructions and authority of the Association, a 
committee from the Commission on Secondary Schools has been 
carried on an investigation of athletics in secondary schools and 
normal schools. The Chairman of that committee, Dr. J. S. Stewart, 
made a preliminary report for his committee, with the request that 
the committee be continued for another year with the privilege of 
completing the investigation. Dr. Stewart has had charge of the 
investigation of athletics in the normal schools in the Southern As- 
sociation territory, and Supt. Omer Carmichael has had charge of 
the investigation of athletics in the secondary schools of the As- 
sociation. A preliminary report was also made by Supt. Carmichael 
with the statement that next year a complete report of both phases 
of the investigation would be made. Dr. Stewart’s report on 
athletics in normal schools follows: 
INTERSCHOLASTIC ATHLETICS IN NORMAL SCHOOLS OF THE 
SOUTH 
Your committee sent the following questionnaire to all of the Normal Schools 
of the South, about 25 schools in all. We did not include the county normal 
training schools. We received replies from 16 of them. 
It seems that all of the Normal Schools stress intramural physical training 
and athletics with full time instructors and the regular scheduled training and 
group athletics. In all of these schools the women far exceed the men. 
The faculty seems to have control of the athletic policy, both intramural 
and interscholastic.

Supt. Carmichael made the following preliminary report on ath- 
letics in the secondary schools of the Association. 
REPORT ON ATHLETICS IN THE PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS 
ACCREDITED BY THE SOUTHERN ASSOCIATION 
Summary Made By 
SUPERINTENDENT OMER CARMICHAEL, of Selma, Alabama, 
Chairman of the Committee. 
The questionnaire was sent to the 600 public high schools accredited by the 
Association in 1923-1924. The summary is based on a total of 325 replies. 
No attempt is made to furnish all the detailed information which has been 
tabulated but we trust the report will indicate some general tendencies in our 
schools. 
Associations. ‘Twelve of the thirteen states seem to have statewide associa- 
tions. Tennessee does not have a state association but has several section 
associations. The committee did not this year attempt a careful study of 
associations, It finds, however, that some state associations confine their activi- 
ties entirely to athletic contests, while others promote contests in other school 
subjects as well. The Texas association is probably the most thoroughly 
organized of all and promotes contests in more subjects than any other. Of 
all schools reporting 95 per cent are members of some association, though 
some are only local. Six per cent of the schools which belong to the athletic 
associations consider that the associations are working poorly, 30 per cent con- 
sider that they are working fairly well, and 64 per cent think they are working 
well. Difficulty in securing proper officials for the games, lack of time for the 
association work on the part of its officers, lack of cooperation of members, 
and lax enforcement of standards are the weaknesses most often mentioned. 
Coaches. In 94 per cent of the schools the coach is a regular member of 
the faculty. The average number of classes he teaches per day is four. He 
seems to be relieved of one period per day because of his coaching duties. 
The average salary is approximately $1,800 and in 98 per cent of the schouls 
is paid by the school board. Forty-five per cent of the schools reporting 
indicate that the salary of the coach is the same as that of other men teachers 
with similar training and experience, 3 per cent that it is less and 52 per cent 
that it is greater. Ninety per cent report that the coach is as well trained 
professionally as the average man in the faculty. 
Finances. Athletics is self-supporting in 55 per cent of the schools and is 
not in 45 per cent. The 45 per cent supplement their athletic funds in various 
ways—plays, pageants, concerts, subscriptions, etc. The athletic fund is dis- 
bursed by the principal, superintendent, coach, faculty manager, student man- 
ager in order named. Seventy-three per cent consider that the athletic finances 
are handled in a business-like way, while 9 per cent say frankly that they 
are not so handled. 
Scholarship and Discipline. All schools report that their pupils are required 
fo meet certain scholarship requirements before they are allowed to play on
-P-A-G-E-84
  84 Proceedings of the Association of Colleges and 
their teams. Forty-eight per cent report that the scholarship of the athletes 
is about the same as that of other pupils, 36 per cent report that it is better, 
and 15 per cent that it is worse. Twenty-six per cent think any differences 
due largely to athletics, 41 per cent little due to athletics and 32 per cent not 
at all. Forty-three per cent report their athletes more respectful to authority 
and obedient to regulations than other pupils, 53 per cent report them about 
the same in this respect, and 4 per cent consider them less respectful and 
obedient. Thirty-seven per cent consider any difference largely due to ath- 
letics, 25 per cent little due to athletics, and 38 per cent not at all due to 
athletics. 
Absence from School for Athletics. As would be expected there is great 
variation in the number of days absent from school for athletics purposes. 
Few schools have regulations limiting this. Those which do have limitations, 
in many cases, allow a high maximum of absence, some as much as ten days 
for each of the three sports. For schools reporting, for 1923-1924 the average 
absence from football was 2.7 days, baseball 3.0 days, basketball 3.0 days, and 
track 1.7 days. 
Playing Summer Baseball for Money. Of schools reporting 2 per cent allow 
their pupils to play summer baseball for money and then play on their teams; 
43 per cent indicate no policy on the question; 5 per cent discourage it; and 
50 per cent forbid it. Fifty-six per cent of the schools favor a general rule 
prohibiting it, while 44 per cent oppose such a rule. 
Betting. Seventy-five per cent of the schools report little or no betting on 
their games by their supporters and 25 per cent some betting. Eighty-six per 
cent report little or no betting on their games by their pupils and 14 per 
cent some betting; 6 per cent report that betting by outsiders is interfering 
with the proper administration of their athletic program. 
Inter-School and Intra-School Athletics. Seventy-five per cent of the schools 
place more emphasis on inter-school athletics than intra-school athletics and 
25 per cent the reverse; 80 per cent spend more money on inter-school athletics 
than on intra-school; 66 per cent think that inter-school contests contribute 
more to the school than intra-school contests do, while 32 per cent take the 
opposite position; 45 per cent think that with equal emphasis inter-school 
contests would be worth more to the school than intra-school contests; 55 per 
cent believe that the intra-school contests would be more valuable; 90 per 
cent report that both public and pupils support inter-school contests better 
than intra-school contests. 
Rewards to Players. Sixty-six per cent of the schools report that they award 
letters only to the players who make their teams, 26 per cent award sweaters, 
and 8 per cent emblems; 28 per cent favor and 72 oppose giving the player 
anything more valuable than the school letter. 
General. Ten per cent of the schools find the activities of alumni and other 
supporters of colleges and higher institutions, in attempting to get athletes 
for specific institutions, very demoralizing to the work of their pupils; 71 per 
cent consider the tendencies of present-day inter-school athletics dangerous 
 
-P-A-G-E-85
  Secondary Schools of the Southern States 85 
to educational ideals. The dangers most often mentioned are over-emphasis 
on winning, too much loss of time from school, too much attention to a few 
individual who least need physical development while the great majority of 
pupils are neglected, too much money spent on athletics. 
7. Report of Committee on the Junior High School. 
W. L. Spencer, Chairman of a special committee appointed one 
year ago to make a study of the junior high school, in the Southern 
Association territory, made a preliminary report. This report was 
in the form of an outline of the work the committee hopes to ac- 
complish. In announcing the fundamental principles which under- 
lie the organization and administration of the junior high school, 
Chairman Spencer made the following statements:

EDUCATION IN RELATION TO THE PLACE OF PRE-VOCATIONAL 
EDUCATION IN THE JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL.

should develop in each individual the knowledge, interests, ideals, habits and 
powers whereby he will find his place and use that place to shape both him- 
self and society toward ever nobler ends. 
Page 13. An effective program of vocational guidance in the secondary 
school is essential. 
Page 18. The pupil should be assisted ordinarily at about 12 or 13 years 
of age to begin a preliminary survey of the activities of adult life and of his 
own aptitudes in connection therewith, so that he may choose, at least tenta- 
tively, some field of human endeavor for special consideration. 
Page 18. The six years to be devoted to secondary education may well be 
divided into two periods which may be designated as the junior and senior 
periods. In the junior period emphasis should be placed upon the attempt 
to help the pupil explore his own aptitudes and to make at least provisional 
choice of the kinds of work to which he will devote himself. In the senior 
period emphasis should be given to training in the field thus chosen. This 
distinction lies at the basis of the organization of junior and senior high 
schools. 
Page 21. The school must capitalize the dominant interest that each boy 
and girl has at the time and direct that interest as wisely as possible. 
Page 21. Especially in the junior high school the pupil should have a 
variety of experience and contacts in order that he may explore his own 
capacities and aptitudes. Through a system of educational supervision or 
guidance he should be helped to determine his education and his vocation. 
These decisions should not be imposed upon him by others.

related curriculums. These should be determined for the most part by voca-

tional needs, including, as they frequently do, preparation for advanced study 
in special fields. 
Page 23-4. In the seventh year, that is the first year of the junior high 
school, the pupil should not be required to choose at the outset the field to 
which he will devote himself. For those who do not at this time have a 
definite purpose, opportunity should be given to gain some experience with 
several significant types of work, such as some form of industrial arts, garden- 
ing or other agricultural activity, typewriting or problems drawn from busi- 
ness, household arts for girls, and for at least a part of the pupils some work 
in foreign language. It may be found feasible to organize several such subjects 
or projects into short units and to arrange the schedule so that every pupil 
may take several of them. The work thus offered may and should be of real 
educational value, in addition to its exploratory value. 
Page 24. Junior high schools must be of the comprehensive type, what- 
ever policy be adopted for the senior high schools, since one of the primary 
purposes of the junior high school is to assist the pupil through a wide 
variety of contacts and experiences to obtain a basis for intelligent choice 
of his educational and vocational career. 
The report was received by the Commission and the Chairman 
was given the following committee to assist him in carrying the 
study to completion: 
W. L. Spencer, Chairman, Alabama; R. M. Sealey, Florida; 
H. M. Ivy, Mississippi; Omer Carmichael, Alabama; N. W. Walker, 
North Carolina. 
A small financial allowance was made the Chairman by the 
Commission with which to prosecute this study. It was the expressed 
hope of the Commission that an intensive study along this line, 
covering several years, would greatly assist in developing the junior- 
senior high school of the southern territory. The Commission felt 
that the junior high school had reached such a stage of develop- 
ment that it should be recognized in our scheme of standardization. 
It is the purposa of this study to inform the Commission of the 
present status of junior high school development arid to inform it as 
to the best line of procedure in the future. 
8. Codification of Rules and Regulations of the Commission. 
One year ago, Dr. J. A. Lyon, of Newcomb College, was ap- 
pointed to codify the rules and regulations of the Commission since 
its beginning in 1911. Dr. Lyon reported that the task was much 
larger than had been anticipated. He asked for further time in 
which to complete this task.

During our session we have had the pleasure of having with us 
Dr. C. O. Davis as the Fraternal Delegate from the North Central 
Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools. Dr. Davis is Pro- 
fessor of Secondary Education at the University of Michigan and 
Secretary of the Commission of Secondary Schools of the North 
Central Association. On several occasions Dr. Davis has been very 
helpful to us in discussing our problems in the light of the working 
of the North Central Association. We have enjoyed having him 
with us and hope the North Central Association will see fit to send 
him to us again next year.

  129 Secondary Schools of the Southern States 
DIVISION IV 
Member Secondary Schools of the Association of 
Colleges and Secondary Schools of the 
Southern States, 1924-1925. 
In order to get the principals of the secondary schools into the spirit of the 
workings of the Association, an effort was made this year to get more of them 
to pay the $5.00 membership fee for their schools and to get the Volume of 
Proceedings and all other reading matter sent out by the organization. There 
were already 209 secondary schools members of the Association. To these 
were added an additional 274 schools, making a total of 483 in all. The 
Commission on Secondary Schools feels that this is a very fine professional 
move and one to be commended. The following table shows the secondary 
schools that are members of the Association. A full list of the schools by 
states is given in Division IV.

‘THE REPORT OF 
THE COMMITTEE ON DEANS’ REPORT 
JOSEPH ROEMER 
Secretary to Southern Commission, Professor of Secondary Education and 
High School Visitor, University of Florida. 
This is the sixth annual Deans’ Report which has been compiled for the 
Association. The purpose of it is to test the efficiency of the secondary schools 
by the way their graduates succeed in their freshman year in college. 
This present report carries data for the high school graduates of the 
spring of 1923. In the fall of 1923, when these spring graduates had gone 
away to college, the principals sent in a blank carrying their names, higher 
institutions attended, and addresses. These lists were compiled by states, by 
higher institutions, and by secondary schools, and sent to the registrars of 
the higher institutions for reports. 
The report has grown each year. It was the practice previous to this 
report to gather these data through the respective state chairmen. The task 
grew to be too much for men already heavily loaded with their regular work. 
Consequently, all the data for this report were gathered by the writer and 
compiled in his office. This was made possible by allowing him a clerical fee 
of $150.00. As a result a much fuller report is herewith submitted. Returns 
were received on 12,119 individual students. These were from 501 higher in- 
stitutions distributed as follows: 54 A, 65 B, 135 C, 100 A’, 74 B’, and 73 C’. 
The 266 other institutions which failed to submit reports made a tutal of 767 
institutions of higher learning asked to submit data for this report. 
The writer feels certain that if all errors were eliminated in the lists of 
students submitted by the principals that less than 2,000 are not actually 
reported on. That means a report on practically 90 per cent of all high 
school graduates. Very few higher institutions in the entire southern territory 
failed to submit data promptly. The same is true of all A and B institutions 
outside the Southern Association territory. Most of the 266 schools mentioned 
above not replying to the request for data were classed as C,—conservatories 
of music, schools of pharmacy, business colleges (97 of these), junior colleges, 
schools of nursing, training schools for religious workers, etc. Consequently, 
we are very grateful to the institutions of higher learning for their fine spirit 
of cooperation which made this report possible. 
Table I shows how the scope of this report has gradually been widened:

138 Proceedings of the Association of Colleges and 
Acting under the instructions of the Southern Commission, a report was 
sought for every student regardless of the type of institution he was attending. 
These reports were for the first quarter or first semester of each student’s 
freshman year. Perhaps a report for the entire year’s work would be better, 
but experience has taught us that we cannot get the data if we wait until 
the end of the session when the colleges are closed and the registrars are away 
on vacation. For that reason, the quarter or semester basis is used. 
Table II which carries detailed data for each school, is self explanatory. 
For purposes of comparative study, this table shows whether schools are public 
or private, built on a seven or eight grade elementary school, in what studies 
failures occur, and what type of high institution the students attend. Table II 
follows:

  166 Proceedings of the Association of Colleges and 
Your Secretary has compiled six tables showing various phases of the work. 
Table III gives a tabulation of the secondary schools by sizes. From a study 
of this Table,’ it is very evident that the Southern High School is not large. 
105, or 15.1%, of them enroll under 100 students; 255, or 36.6%, enroll from 
100 to 200 students; and 222, or 32%, enroll from 200 to 500 students. In 
other words, about one-half enroll less than 200 students; about one-third enroll 
from 200 to 500 students; and about one-sixth enroll over 500 students. The 
range is from 22 to 2,913, with only nine schools enrolling over 2,000 students. 
Table III follows:

Table IV is prepared to give the reader a little better grasp of the report. 
This table shows (a) the number of schools built on a seven or eight grade 
elementary school; (b) the number of public and private schools; (c) the 
number of students reported on from each state; (d) the number of students 
enrolled in each type of institution of higher learning, and (e) the percentage 
of failures that occur in each type of higher institution. Six classes of insti- 
tutions are employed. This classification was arrived at by following the 
authorized lists of institutions issued by the Association of Colleges and Sec- 
ondary Schools of the Southern States, and by the U. S. Bureau of Education, 
Bulletin No. 30, 1922, entitled “Accredited Higher Institutions.” 
As is seen at a glance, all institutions of higher learning are cut into two 
large subdivisions; namely, those in the southern territory, and those outside 
of the southern territory. The following classification was used: 
A. All higher institutions that are members of the Southern Association. 
B. All institutions of higher learning in the Southern Association territory 
that are not members of the Association, but whose graduates are 
accepted as teachers in the secondary schools accredited by the South- 
ern Commission.
-P-A-G-E-167
Secondary Schools of the Southern States 167 
C. All other four year colleges, junior colleges, normal schools, business 
colleges, etc., in the Southern Association territory. 
A’. )All institutions of higher learning outside of Southern Association 
B’. \territory, classified as the A, B, and C colleges above.

Secondary Schools of the Southern States 169 
It is interesting to note that practically one-half of the students are enrolled 
in standard or Class A, institutions in the Southern Association territory; that 
25.9 percent are enrolled in Class B institutions in the Southern territory, and 
18 percent are enrolled in Class C institutions. In other words, 93.7 percent 
of the students are in college in institutions of higher learning in the Southern 
Association territory. 
Failures by classes of institutions are also striking. The percentages shade 
down from 15.1 in Class A to 12.6 in Class B and 7.6 in Class’ C schools. 
Practically the same condition exists in the institutions outside’ the Southern 
Association territory. Since it is the purpose of this report to find facts, not 
to discuss them, the writer in passing would like to raise two questions here: 
(1) Why is this? 
(2) Is it right? 
In order to make the study as helpful as possible, the three comparisons 
made in last year’s report are continued this year. They are as follows: 
1. How do graduates of private secondary schools succeed, in college, as 
compared with graduates of public secondary schools? 
2. How do graduates of secondary schools built on a seven grade elemen- 
tary school succeed in college as compared with graduates of secondary 
schools built on an eight grade elementary school? 
3. Does the size of the secondary school from which the pupil graduates 
bear any relation to his success in his freshman year in college? 
Table V carries these comparative data. Five groupings of secondary schools 
are used in this Table. In order to follow up the comparisons made last year, 
all secondary schools are thrown into three groups, viz., small high school, 
enrolling from 26-199; medium high school enrolling from 200-499, and the 
large secondary school enrolling all over 1,000 pupils. 
In Table V, no effort is made to run comparisons between the number of 
students graduating and the number going on to college, due to incomplete 
data. 
The difference between the “Number entering college,” and the “Number 
reported” is due to two causes; namely, the failure on the part of some col- 
leges to fill blanks sent them for the Deans’ Report, and secondly, the failure 
of the secondary school principals to give exact data on where graduates are 
attending college. For example, one principal reported 150 graduates, 100 
going to college, and then only listed 70 students actually in college. 
In order to arrive at the percentages of failures for each school, the schools 
in a state, and the schools in certain groups, it was assumed that each student 
carried five colleges courses during his freshman year. Consequently, the 
number of students reported for any school or group was multiplied by five 
and divided into the number of courses failed by that school or group and 
the percentage ascertained. Therefore, in reading the column headed. “% 
courses failed,” the data means that that per cent of all courses taken in col- 
lege were failed.

It has been a debatable question in our educational administration for 
several decades whether the eighth grade in our traditional elementary school 
is justifiable. As a rule our judgments have been subjective. Table VI 
below is an effort to see objectively if it functions when the high school 
graduate is in his freshman year at college. Since these data are available 
for the last three reports, a comparative table is submitted here. Likewise, a 
comparison is made between graduates of public and private schools.

Dean Ives of Louisiana State University has recently made a small study 
of this question of the effectiveness of the seventh and eighth grade systems 
with results that coincide rather closely with this report; namely, that the dif- 
ference is so slight as to be negligible. It is hoped that studies like his, on 
a much more extensive scale, will soon be made. Perhaps another three years 
are needed in this study before conclusive evidence is had. Although there 
is some fluctuation from year to year, on the whole, 1.7 per cent average for a 
period of three years is not of very much importance. 
For the third successive year, the percentage of failures in private schools 
exceeds those in public schools. Here again a longer period of study is 
necessary before definite conclusions can be drawn. 
The question is often asked, what is the most efficient size of high school? 
Many educators feel that the small high school with opportunity for personal 
touch is best, while others feel that the large cosmopolitan high school stands 
first. It is the purpose of Table VII below to see objectively which is best, if 
judged by the way the graduates succeed in college. Table VII follows:

A careful study of Table VII will show that there is very little difference 
in any of these groups. An average of three years shows a very slight advan- 
tage in favor of the medium sized high school. The large high school comes 
next in rank, and the small school is last; but the difference is too insignificant 
to be of importance. Again, a longer period is needed for comparison. 
Table VIII below shows the comparative rank of each state over a period of 
three years. As would be expected, there is considerable fluctuation in the 
rank of states from year to year. It is interesting to note, however, that the

PRESIDENT’S ADDRESS 
An Ancient Educational Ideal 
IDENTIFICATION OF THE INTEREST OF THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE 
STATE THROUGH EDUCATION 
Dean L. T. Baker, University of South Carolina 
In Xenophon’s Memorabilia, the citizen Ischomachus in describing his daily 
activities, says: “I endeavor to the best of my ability assisted by prayer, to 
get health and strength of body, reputation in the city, good will among my 
friends, honorable security in battle and an honorable increase in fortune.” 
“Do you really then covet wealth?” interrupts Socrates, “with all the trouble 
that it invelves?” 
“Certainly I do,” is the reply, “for it enables me to honor the gods magnifi- 
cently, to help my friends if they are in want, and to contribute to the resources 
of my country.” 
This identification of the interests and welfare of citizen and state or the 
realization of self in public activity seems to have been the supreme ideal of 
Athenian education. 
Practically every citizen was in constant and direct service of his state. 
He was soldier of course, and as all civil offices were filled by lot or by election 
for short terms, he could in the space of a few years serve as priest, magistrate, 
jurist or legislator, and in addition, if he had the means, perform such litur- 
gies as equipping warships and assuming the expense and responsibility of 
training choruses for civic and religious festivals. 
In the city state, which Aristotle ideally defines as “an association of similar 
persons for the attainment of the best life possible,” education for citizenship 
became an important function of statecraft, and citizenship became as it were 
a degree conferred on the candidate for its privileges only after he had passed 
a satisfactory examination. Originally this examination was simply an in- 
quiry into the candidate’s right by ancestry. When the city state became 
more populous and more democratic and when the privilege of citizenship was 
extended and conferred for merit, then state support and even control of 
education became imperative in order to preserve the State’s unity. “The best 
laws,” said Aristotle, “though sanctioned by every citizen, will be of no avail 
unless the young are trained by habit and education in the spirit of the con- 
stitution.” It is in recognition of this principle that the lawgivers Lycurgus 
and Solon and the philosophers in their discussion of the ideal state give so 
much space and emphasis to the details of education. 
(173)
-P-A-G-E-174
  hy 4 Proceedings of the Association of Colleges and 
In actual practice and in the schemes of education for citizenship proposed 
by the philosophers little stress was laid on the acquisition of knowledge. 
Education was a developing and training process which aimed at “a union of 
thought and conduct guided by reason.” 
Referring to the necessity of education for the preservation of the State, 
Aristotle said: “Virtue and goodness in the State are not a matter of chance 
but the result of knowledge and purpose. A city can be virtuous only when 
the citizens who have a share in the government are virtuous; and in our 
State all citizens share in the government; let us then inquire how a man may 
become virtuous.” 
The words “virtue” and “virtuous” have acquired a triteness that would 
reduce the quotation to a platitude did we not bear in mind the full and 
beautiful significance of the Greek word “Arete.” Our word “worth” sums up 
all the traits in the Greek conception of noble character and perfect manhood. 
Tt expresses their realization of the trinity of the true, the beautiful, and the 
good. In the individual, it is the realization of “logos” or the complete har- 
mony of mind, soul and body. Sculpture, architecture and poetry represent 
their endeavor to give it concrete expression. Its meaning changes with the 
connection of the period in which it is used; the change, however, is merely 
a shifting of emphasis to one or another of the qualities it includes. 
In the beginning of city-state history, when only the “man of wealth and 
worth” could qualify for citizenship, “wealth” meant “landright” and “worth” 
became an expression for the qualities the well-born presumably possessed, 
and especially of those that ensured his fitness to perform military and civic 
services and to maintain the supremacy of a privileged and cultured minority. 
The ideal man of worth in Homeric days was “the man of counsel and the 
man of action.” Ulysses typifies wisdom and Achilles action. Among the 
references in the Iliad to education, one stands out as an ancient and worthy 
objective in these words of Phoenix to Achilles: 
“In all of which I was set by him to instruct thee as my son 
That thou mightest speak when speech was fit, and do when 
deeds are done; 
Not sit as dumb for want of words, idle for skill to move.” 
Just when the city states began to devise a formal scheme of education is 
uncertain. Sparta was the first to both support and control education and so 
thoroughly did she do this that we might call her, borrowing the appellation 
of Goethe, “a pedagogical province.” 
It would be interesting here to review the details of Spartan training for 
citizenship but time does not permit. The verdict of contemporary and mod- 
ern history is decidedly unfavorable to the results of the Spartan system and 
dwells on the coarseness, brutality and harshness of the people and the ruth- 
lessness of Sparta’s diplomatic and military policies. We are called to note 
how little she contributed to the world in art and science. Her method of 
education, however, was a success and it is perhaps due to it alone that a 
self sufficient little state of a few thousand citizens, under the constant menace
-P-A-G-E-175
Secondary Schools of the Southern States 175 
of domestic and foreign foes could not only maintain its integrity for so long 
a period but also eventually obtain the military supremacy of Hellas. 
The lesson of Sparta to education is one of perfect adaptation of means to 
an end. It was demonstrated that a desired type of citizen could be produced 
by education. Sparta clearly recognized the need of stressing certain physical 
and moral virtues in the training of the young and took the best means of 
realizing her definite and clearly visioned aim. “As for learning,” says Plu- 
tarch, “they had just what was absolutely necessary. All of the rest of their 
education was calculated to make them subject to command, to endure toil, 
to fight and to conquer.” 
In singleness of aim, simplicity of method and almost perfect adaptation of 
means to ends, the Athenian education, prior to the Age of Pericles, was not 
unlike that of Sparta; but while Athens also held that the welfare of the 
state was the supreme end of education, yet her system gave full opportunity 
for the free development of personality and encouraged initiative and creative- 
ness. The Athenian in temperament was individualistic and progressive; the 
Dorian, communistic and conservative. Environment also had a compelling 
influence in making one State militarist and socialistic and the other com- 
mercial and democratic. In each we find a theory and practice of education 
reflecting the spirit of the city and its constitution. 
Contrary to the Spartan policy, the Athenian plan of education aimed not 
to destroy the family but to preserve it as a means of developing personality. 
Therefore the education of the youth until he reached the age of taking his 
oath of citizenship was left largely to the discretion of his parents. Educa- 
tion nevertheless was under the general supervision of the state. Both law 
and public opinion demanded a certain culture for prospective citizens and 
did not permit parents to let children grow up in ignorance and coarseness. 
As an evidence that elementary education was esteemed a necessity of life, 
we might recall that when the Athenian women and children took refuge in 
Troizen during the Persian invasion, the people of that little city provided not 
only clothes and food but also teachers for the children; and that the Myti- 
lenaeans punished their revolting allies by not allowing their children to be 
taught. A verse of Euripides’ fairly expresses the Athenian attitude: 
“Whoso neglects learning in his youth, loses the past 
and is dead to the present.” 
The elementary schools of Athens were private institutions of two kinds, one 
for music and literature and the other for gymnastics. Between these the 
boy divided his day from sunrise to sunset attended by his pedagog, a slave 
responsible for his manners and conduct on the street and in the school. At 
the music school, which might be an humble affair on some portico or over a 
shop, or a well equipped building adorned with statues of Apollo and the 
muses, the boy took his lessons in writing, reading, singing and playing the 
cither. The greater part of his day was spent at the palestra in games and 
under the training of the paidotribes in a formal course of exercises consist-
-P-A-G-E-176
  176 Proceedings of the Association of Colleges and 
ing of running, leaping, javelin throwing, discus throwing and wrestling. Here 
also he practiced military tactics and dancing. 
At the age of sixteen the youth began his ephebic education at one of the 
gymnasia maintained by the state. These were vast enclosures beyond the city 
walls ornamented with groves, altars and shrines and equipped with exercise 
grounds, colennades and buildings with rooms for various purposes such as 
oiling, bathing, etc. Here the yeung candidate for citizenship was under the 
supervision of the sophronistes and other magistrates responsible for the dis- 
cipline and morals of young men. His physical trainers were the paidotribes 
for gymnastics, riding and dancing, and the gymnastes who like the modern 
coach gave special training for athletic games and contests. His inspirer or 
eispneles served as general guide and counsellor. 
Contact and association now become the main agencies in the boy’s intel- 
lectual and aesthetic development. Participating in public ceremonies, at- 
tending the courts and theatres, mingling freely with adults in the agora 
and gymnasia, listening with that eager curiosity so characteristic of his race, 
and modestly joining in the discussions of his elders, he learned the ethics, 
morals and laws of his city and became imbued with the spirit of its con- 
stitution. 
Shortly after his eighteenth birthday, in the presence of the assembled citi- 
zens, the youth was armed with helmet, shield and spear and took the solemn 
oath of the epebos or citizen novitiate. Then began his two years of military 
training and service which was compulsory for all under the old regime. The 
first year was spent in the city where he did guard duty and continued his in- 
struction in the gymnasia and his service in religious and other state festivals. 
At the end of the year he passed an examination before the people in mili- 
tary taetics, and after a second year in garrison duty on the frontier he ap- 
peared for his final examination—the dokimasia eis andres or examination for 
manhood and citizenship. 
We admire the literature and art of Greece for its simplicity, unity and 
proportion, but no creation of her genius better displays these qualities than 
her system of training the young. It was sometimes called enkuklios paideia 
(encyclopaedia) ; but it was far from encyclopedic in our sense of the word; 
compared with our crowded and complex curricula, it seems scant and inade- 
quate; yet it was nicely adjusted to the needs and ideals of the state. Later 
on when the city became imperial, and when the demands of living and pub- 
lic service became more diversified and complex, we find Athens struggling 
with educational problems similar to those of our own day, and they were 
similarly embarrassed and perplexed. “After the Persian Wars, with more 
zeal and discernment,” says Aristotle, “they pursued every kind of knowledge, 
beating about generally.” 
The final test and evidence of the old Athenian general and disciplinary 
education is that it produced men and works of the Periclean Age. With 
some allowance for exaggeration due to the occasion we may accept the fol- 
lowing excerpts from the Funeral Oration as fairly representative of some 
good results of Athenian education:
-P-A-G-E-177
  Secondary Schools of the Southern States 177 
“We regard a man who takes no interest in public affairs not as harmless but 
as a useless character, and if few of us are originators, we are all sound judges 
of policy.” 
“The great impediment to action is, in our opinion, not discussion but the 
want of that knowledge which is gained by discussion prior to action. We 
have a peculiar power of thinking before we act and of acting too.” 
“In our private intercourse we are not suspicious of one another, nor angry 
with our neighbor if he does what he likes.” 
“While we are unconstrained in our private affairs, a spirit of reverence 
pervades our public acts: we are prevented from doing wrong by respect for 
authority and for the laws.” 
“We are lovers of the beautiful, yet simple in our tastes, and we cultivate 
the mind without loss of manliness; wealth we employ not for talk and osten- 
tation but when there is real use for it. To avow poverty with us is no dis- 
grace; the true disgrace is in doing nothing to avoid it.” 
“An Athenian citizen does not neglect the state because he takes care of 
his own household; and even those of us who are engaged in business have a 
very fair idea of politics.” 
“To sum up: I say that Athens is the school of Hellas, and that the indi- 
vidual Athenian in his own person, seems to have the power of adapting him- 
self to the most varied forms of action with the utmost versatility and grace.” 
But the Athens eulogized in this oration had begun to pass away at the time 
of its delivery. The city had become the world’s metropolis in commerce 
and science and the arts. It was the Mecca of all who excelled in any field 
of endeavor. 
The new imperial democracy with its complicated internal problems and 
vital issues of foreign policy came under the control of the “unassimilated 
many”—‘“the Great Beast,” as Plato calls it, “moved only by its emotional 
appetites.” The enjoyment and employment of wealth and political power for 
personal and selfish ends rather than the ancient honor and satisfaction of 
loyal service now became the goal of men of superior ability. Character train- 
ing and preparation for the duties of citizenship as primary aims of educa- 
tion were superseded by an eager pursuit of all kinds of knowledge and skill 
useful for personal advancement. Passion, prejudice and greed superseded the 
control of temperance, reason and loyalty to the state. The highly cultured 
leisure class was diverted or driven from the service of the state to the pur- 
suit of wealth, science or philosophy, and the government was abandoned to 
the talking demagogue who found it easy to sway the ruling mob unprepared 
as it was for its new powers and responsibilities. Culture and citizenship 
were no longer synonymous. The new demos could not like that of former 
days become an association of similar persons for the attainment of the best 
life possible. Education had gradually ceased to be a qualification for the 
suffrage and eventually even for leadership and high office. A passage from 
“The Knights” illustrates this degeneration of democracy. The “Sausage 
Seller,” protesting his unfitness for high office, exclaims: 
 
-P-A-G-E-178
178 Proceedings of the Association of Colleges and 
“But bless you! only consider my education! 
I can barely read—in a kind of way.” 
The aristocrat general retorts: 
“That makes against you—the only thing against you— 
The being able to read, in any way 
For now no lead nor influence is allowed 
To liberal arts or learned education, 
But to the brutal, base and underbred.” 
The social and political problems of an age strikingly similar to those that 
confront us today produced that great literature on the relation of education 
to the state which has been a source of guidance and inspiration for suc- 
ceeding ages. Aristophanes lashes the new learning and the new schools with 
biting satire; Xenophon advocates the adoption of the old Spartan education; 
Isocrates and the better class of Sophists try to show that their schools trained 
for public as well as for individual advantage.. Plato and Aristotle endeavor 
to reconcile the interests of the individual and the state. 
“Aristotle,” says Professor Gidding, “saw and stated that were it possible 
to maintain an aristocracy in the true sense of the word, namely, the rule of 
the virtuous, the wise, the self-sacrificing and the prudent, it would be folly to 
contemplate any other form of government—and so, the philosopher realizing 
the day had forever passed in which its realization was possible sets aside his 
preferences and grapples with the problem: 
“What sort of education, what kind of training shall we maintain in our 
democratic communities in order that the errors of popular judgment, the 
passion and unreason of mobs shall be as narrowly as possible restricted in 
action: in order that the masses shall be developed into self-reliant, self-re- 
specting, calm thinking and patriotic citizens, who in spite of the relative 
imperfections of state in which the end is the perfection of the good life 
through discipline of the mind and the inner transformation of the souls of 
individual citizens.” 
Though the Greeks failed to find a perfect answer to this question so mo- 
mentous to our age, nevertheless from their experience and their theory we 
have a rich legacy of suggestion which we may profitably use in our elementary 
and higher education. 
If our elementary schools are to succeed in producing citizens fit for democ- 
racy, they must rely less on text books and preaching and stress training and 
discipline of mind and body. The Athenian lad did not acquire a strong 
and graceful body and learn to use and revere it from a study of text books 
on physiology and hygiene. His patriotism, loyalty and reverence were not a 
product of lessons and lectures on civil government. His exercises in music, 
gymnastics and lessons and dancing had their end in the satisfactory expression 
of ideas and emotions engendered by the history and poetic literature of his 
race. Above all, he mastered, by this constant practice in expression his native 
longue, that most perfect vehicle of human thought and feeling.

In the secondary stage of Athenian education, lasting for four years and cor- 
responding with our secondary and collegiate period, we find no evidence of 
specialization or training for vocational and professional ends. It was a lib- 
eral education whose tradition coming to us from Hellas, the colleges of liberal 
arts and secondary schools of America must cherish and maintain if they 
hope to train such leaders of the people who in spite of the relative imper- 
fections of our democracy will strive to maintain a state in which the end is 
the perfection of the good life. 
Tt will be long before universal education catches up with universal suffrage. 
The mere removal of illiteracy only enhances the opportunities of vicious and 
misguided leadership. Meantime we must maintain our faith in the four year 
cultural course of the arts college to develop fitness and inclination for demo- 
cratic leadership and service. And also, we must resist the tendency to abbre- 
viate or even eliminate the cultural element in the education of our lawyers, 
doctors, engineers and industrial experts. Their contact with the people is 
more intimate and direct than that of the editors, preachers and teachers with 
whom they must share the responsibility of enlightened leadership of our 
people toward the realization of that ancient and noble ideal of an educated 
democracy—an association or state maintained for the freedom of the indi- 
vidual in the pursuit of happiness.

10. What is the attitude of your institution toward giving credit toward 
degrees for work done by correspondence and in extension classes? 
We favor it, 29; We are opposed to it, 19; We are undecided 1; question 
not answered by 10. 
A few typical answers to this question are given below. Each quotation is 
from a different institution. 
Some of those who favor such credit say in part: 
“Extension courses given degree credit in institutions which are members 
of the National University Extension Association shall be accepted without 
question by this university. The work offered by students coming from other 
institutions, not members of the National University Extension Association, 
will be considered upon its merits by our entrance committee after careful 
examination of the work.” 
“Credit should be given for courses offered by institutions whose residence 
work is accepted.” 
“Favorable if students are mature.” 
“Certain universities, and possibly a few colleges, have extension courses 
that may have the same careful planning as our residence courses and the 
same strict requirements enforced. It is our custom to give credit for courses 
that we judge to be of this type when such credit is requested.” 
“We give credit for correspondence work toward the Bachelor’s degree, if 
the institution from which the correspondence work is taken grants degree 
credit for same.” 
“The university allows 60 credits of work taken by extension (in class or by 
correspondence) to apply towards a bachelor’s degree. I fully endorse this 
policy and I am in favor of allowing some extension work to be taken for 
graduate credit. I believe that extension work gives as thoro training as 
resident work, but I do not think that any degree should be granted on less 
than a year’s resident work.” 
“Our faculty is favorable to the use of correspondence study for subjects 
not involving laboratory, when courses are so organized as to place responsi- 
bility for content and study upon the departments concerned.” 
“Am heartily in accord.” 
“We limit the credit by correspondence to 16 of the 38 required majors, 
and for graduate credit the problem is simplified thru the fact that 3 quarters’ 
residence is required in all cases. Extension classes taught by our own in- 
structors carry credit in all cases in which entrance requirements are met.” 
“We believe in correspondence study, because it involves a vast amount of 
written work and careful thinking. We are not so sure of the quality of pure 
extension courses, that is, courses not involving correspondence work.” 
“Tf such work is well done, we think it worthy of credit. We have given 
credit to such work done by several of the universities.” 
“If courses are standard ones and well given these should receive credit to- 
ward the degree not to exceed 50 per cent of the requirements for the de- 
gree.”
-P-A-G-E-182
182 Proceedings of the Association of Colleges and 
“Correspondence courses may be satisfactory if courses are properly planned 
and students are not allowed to take too much work.” 
“When these courses reach our college standards we expect to give college 
credit for them.” 
Some of those who do not favor credit toward degrees for correspondence 
and extension class work say in part: 
“In this college it is practically prohibited. By special action of the faculty 
a senior student may be admitted to one advanced course in the Night School 
of Commerce with ‘degree credit.’ During the last three years two senior 
students have been granted this privilege.” 
“We decline to given credit for such work.” 
“I should doubt the wisdom of it.” 
“Our faculty has declared itself on correspondence courses—no credit 
allowed. The question of credit for extension courses has not been presented 
—no applications for such credit received up to this time.” 
“Unfavorable.” 
“Do not approve of it on college degrees.” 
“It has been against our policy to accept credit for such work.” 
“Not enthusiastic on this subject—where the work is done thru correspond- 
ence courses.” 
11. Please summarize extension activities of your institution. 
The following extension activities were named by one or more of the fifty- 
nine who answered the questionnaire: correspondence courses; extension 
classes; agricultural extension; visual instruction; lecture service; public dis- 
cussion bureau; community drama and music; municipal information and re- 
search; economic and social surveys; high school debating, oratory, music 
and athletics; publications such as bulletins, clip sheets, news letters, and 
the like; educational surveys; information service and advice; package libra- 
ries; women’s club programs; reading courses; study centers; traveling and 
loan libraries; health service bureau; forum teaching; laboratory service. 
The term “Extension Service” does not seem to convey the same meaning to 
all of the fifty-nine persons who answered the questionnaire. To at least a 
third of the number such service seems insignificant. To others it seems to 
mean a publicity bureau to advertise the institution to which it is attached, 
thereby attracting a larger student body and increasing the income of the in- 
stitution, To a few it seems to suggest such activities as lecturing, holding 
evening classes, or publishing bulletins. 
  Altho University or College Extension is a relatively recent movement, hav- 
ing had its o-igin fifty-one years ago at the University of Cambridge, it appears 
to have established itself permanently in the United States. A definitely or- 
ganized Extension Division was first set up in the University of Wisconsin in 
1906. Since that time, in this country, the aim and scope of College and 
University Extension Service has been somewhat clearly defined. Its aim is to 
extend educational advantages to the men and women who for economic or
-P-A-G-E-183
      Secondary Schools of the Southern States 183 
social reasons do not attend an educational institution; to make education 
a permanent life interest along with religion, politics, and pleasure; and to ex- 
tend university standards and methods to all men’s life interests. 
This aim is realized thru formal instruction and informal instruction. Formal 
instruction includes teaching by correspondence and thru extension classes. 
The enrollment in extension credit courses by correspondence study and by 
extension class instruction in the United States is more than 200,000, while 
there are many times this number enrolled in non-credit extension courses. 
Informal extension instruction is accomplished by lending moving picture 
films, lantern slides, and package libraries to individuals and organizations; by 
bulletin service; and by forum teaching. Thru informal extension instruction 
the knowledge, standards, and methods gained, thru laboratory and library 
research, are carried from the campus into the world of everyday affairs and 
applied to such life interests as commerce and trade, music and drama, eco- 
nomics and politics, health, industrial relations, recreation and social work. 
Thru this type of informal extension instruction, millions of people thruout 
the United States have seen the walls of isolation which surrounded them 
broken down, and have been led to form the habit of turning to sources of 
authentic information for help, rather than of depending upon accidental 
knowledge. 
Thus extension service is defined. Every college administrator must decide 
sooner or later whether or not his institution will enter this field of service. 
Answers to the questionnaires show that twenty-six instiutions accredited by 
the Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools have already entered it. 
Others will enter from time to time as the demand from the public increases. 
While this new field offers many opportunities for service, it presents also 
its peculiar problems. 
From the point of view of this Association, the greatest problem presented 
by extension service is the standardization of extension class and correspond- 
ence courses offered for credit toward degrees. Already more than forty-seven 
hundred students are enrolled in such courses offered by institutions represented 
here. Already the question of whether or not to give credit toward degrees 
for work done by correspondence and thru extension classes has been raised. 
In some institutions the answer to this question is negative; in others the 
answer is affirmative; and in still others the answer is affirmative provided 
work is given under proper conditions. Should institutions accredited by this 
Association give credit toward degrees for work done by correspondence and 
thru extension classes? If the answer is yes, what are the conditions under 
which such credit should be given? What percentage of credits required for 
the different degrees may be earned by correspondence and extension class 
work? Sooner or later this Association will have to answer these questions. 
Why not begin now? y 
Probably the most trustworthy data bearing upon University Extension credit 
courses is to be found in a report of the National University Extension Asso-    
-P-A-G-E-184
184 Proceedings of the Association of Colleges and 
ciation. This report was written by a Committee on Standardization, W. D. 
Henderson, University of Michigan, Chairman. It is published in a seventy- 
page bulletin, and may be secured from Mr. James A. Moyer, Secretary, State 
Department of Education, Boston, Mass. 
Following is a summary of the findings of this Committee on Standardization: 
Practically all the educational institutions of university grade in this coun- 
try now have more or less well-established Extension divisions as a part of 
their regular university organizations. The notable exceptions are Princeton, 
Cornell, Ohio State University, and the University of Illinois. . . . 
The enrollment in Extension credit courses in the institutions enumerated 
in this report at the close of the last fiscal year was as follows: 
  Extension credit courses, class instruction......... . 81,550 
Extension credit courses, correspondence study.... - 37,400 
Total enrollment (nearly) ................005 Nips stesso ss L9,000: 
In 29 of the 40 institutions listed Extension credit courses are practically 
the same in character and content as are the corresponding courses offered on 
the campus. .. . 
The data given reveal the fact that a grand total of about 5,000 courses 
are offered thru University Extension. These course include 75 different gen- 
eral subjects. By the term “general subjects” we mean department subjects, 
as, for example, economics, mathematics, philosophy, and so forth. 
Some of the institutions listed employ as instructors in Extension credit 
courses members of the resident faculty only. In the remaining cases, addi- 
tional instructors are employed; that is, instructors other than those of the 
regular resident faculty... . 
Correspondence study outlines are, in general, prepared by regular faculty 
members, such outlines being subject to the approval of the director of the 
Extension division and of the dean of the department concerned. In general, 
the reading, correction, and instruction given in connection with correspond- 
ence study assignments is done by regularly appointed instructors who have 
the specific course in charge. . . . 
In general, the institutions listed require one year of residence work for 
graduation, this year in the great majority of cases being the senior year. In 
nearly all cases, Extension courses do not count as residence courses. There 
are a few exceptions. . . . 
In general, students are allowed to take as many hours of Extension credit 
work as they can carry satisfactorily, this last point to be determined by the 
director of the Extension division in conference with the instructor in 
charge... . 
The question of allowing graduate credit for work done in Extension classes 
is subject to great variation. For example, Chicago allows Extension credits 
earned by correspondence to count toward the Doctor’s degree, under certain
-P-A-G-E-185
Secondary Schools of the Southern States 185 
specific conditions; Colorado, on the other hand, allows credit toward the 
Master’s degree but not for the Doctor’s degree. 
Eighteen universities accept credits for graduate work under certain condi- 
tions. In géneral, such credits are allowed subject to the condition that 
cases be passed upon individually by the dean of the graduate school. 
ANCIENT ATHLETICS—THEIR USE AND ABUSE 
Proressor A. L, Bonpurant, University of Mississippi 
We still hail Greece as mother of the arts, and Rome as the fountain of 
law. But they are both fountains which have yielded at times bitter waters 
as well as sweet, “Conquered Greece led captive victorious Rome,” but in 
turn she brought to Rome along with her art many vices which corrupted 
and corroded the body politic. We are debtors to Rome for the first republi- 
can state which endured. She gave the best code of laws which the world 
had known; laws which dominate civilized nations today, but unfortunately 
the world learned other lessons which had better have been left unlearned. 
The Roman often seemed unaware of the rights of others if these “others” 
happened not to be Romans. He too often had little sense of his obligation 
to his fellow if that “fellow” chanced to be a slave. Rome nationalized the 
gladiatorial games, and impressed upon its peoples by this means the vices of 
cruelty, and lust for blood. 
But when the debit and credit columns are cast up, the credit will largely 
be on the side of these great peoples who gave to the world two great litera- 
tures, an appreciation for art, a knowledge of what a well ordered society 
should be, and an appreciation for laws wisely made, and ably administered. 
But now in the brief time at our command we are to discuss only one 
phase of the contributions which they have made, and by reading properly 
this page of history, to note certain lessons that may be applied in the life 
of today. 
The Greeks probably entered the land which they finally made their own 
well before the first millennium before the Christian era. They found a civili- 
zation which was highly developed, in fact, much richer than their own. The 
remains of “Mycenae, of Cnossos, and other cities bear ample testimony to 
the accuracy of this statement. When they entered the peninsula they were 
an unlettered race, and had not developed beyond the pastoral stage. 
Their union with the native folk gave to the world a people which was by 
no means the pure stock which they themselves had supposed. We have little 
knowledge of the details of the life of this period as there are no written 
remains, and the monumental remains are of the scantiest. It is certain, 
however, that it was at first tribal and rural, and that the sports of the 
period were athletic exercises of the simplest nature, and indulged in partially 
for recreation, but more especially to prepare the youth for their greatest  
-P-A-G-E-186
186 Proceedings of the Association of Colleges and 
game, war. They had their contests in boxing and wrestling of a nature 
which Theocritus writing much later describes in his idyls. Youths learned 
endurance for a campaign by these exercises, and by running matches at the 
rustic festivals which were held in all the demes of Greece. They learned to 
climb mountains, to swim rivers, and hurl darts. 
When the Homeric period comes we are no longer left in the twilight, for 
the poet describes for us in detail the activities in athletics of the warriors 
who played a part in the Trojan war. But we note here that accounts of 
athletic sports seemed to have been confined to those of high degree. This 
does not mean that the rank and file did not have them, but only that Homer, 
the poet of princes, did not write of them. Both the Iliad and the Odyssey 
give accounts of the doings of the heroes in this regard. The chiefs were 
famous, not only in war, but on the athletic field. Odysseus was noted for his 
wisdom, and for his prowess as a soldier, and also as an athlete; Achilles 
the peerless, was facile princeps whether in boxing, wrestling, or behind his 
spirited steeds in the chariot race; Menelaus was mighty in battle but also in 
wrestling, and the other sports of the palaestra. 
We must not suppose, however, that in this age athletics were organized, 
or that anything corresponding to the later development had come into exis- 
tence. We have no stadia, or gymnasia, or palaestrae. These all came with 
a later age. The funeral games celebrated in honor of Patroclus by his 
brother-in-arms Achilles picture for us, no doubt truthfully, the athletics of 
the period and foreshadow the development which was to follow, for we shall 
see that the sports in which they indulged were the sports that formed the 
core of the athletic exercises of a later day. 
Homer leaves little to the imagination. The common soldiers laid down 
their spears, and taking axes went to the mountains. There they felled 
mighty trees to make a suitable pyre upon which to place the body of Patroclus 
for the funeral rites. The lords of Greece then assemble under the command 
of Achilles for the games that are to follow. The prizes that are offered are 
worthy of the noble dead, and the giver of the funeral games. They are: a 
woman skilled in fair handiwork, a capacious tripod of bronze, a six-year old 
mare unbroke, a goodly cauldron untouched by fire, two talents of gold, a 
bronze urn untouched by fire, a two-handled cup, a mixing bowl of silver. 
There was no stadium for this contest, but it was held “in an open place, 
where the waves were breaking on the shore.” 
The chariot race was given first place, and Homer in his description of 
the games gives special prominence to this sport of kings. 
The contest in boxing next gained their attention. For this event two 
doughty champions were entered—Epeios and Euryalos. The boxers entered 
the ring with thongs of oxhide wound around their hands. They both fought 
bravely, but before the conflict was over Epeios dealt his adversary a knock- 
out blow. And here we have a fine example of sportsmanship. Epeios did 
not retire to his side of the ring, and wait for the companions of Euryalos 
to pick him up covered with dust and spitting out clotted blood, but was the
-P-A-G-E-187
  Secondary Schools of the Southern States 187 
first at his side, and the one that set him upright. These Greeks of the 
heroic age were hard fighters, but they were often gentle withal, and modern 
sportsmanship can draw many a lesson from the heroic age that would re- 
dound to the credit of modern sports. 
The pancratium was the next event, a contest that tried the nerve of the 
bravest man. It was more than wrestling; it was ground wrestling, and the 
rules seemed to have allowed kicking and butting. This contest claimed two 
doughty entrants, Telamon’s son Ajax, and Odysseus of many wiles. They 
strove for no mean prize, a wrought tripod. They struggled long, and neither 
seemed to be able to get the better of the other. The arbiter of the games 
declared this a drawn contest, and both carried off equal prizes. 
Next came the footraces. Here the first prize was a cup, the second a fat 
ox, and the last a half talent of gold. There were three who took part in this 
contest—Ajax son of Oileus, Odysseus, and Antilochus the son of Nestor, and 
Odysseus, although the oldest, bore off the first prize. Then came the throw- 
ing of “an unwrought metal mass,” corresponding to the throwing of the 
discus at a later day, and last of all came the contest in archery. 
We may consider also briefly the account given by Vergil in the fifth book 
of Aeneid of the funeral games held in honor of Anchises, on the island of 
Sicily. Vergil was a clost student of Homer, and perhaps no man of his day 
knew more thoroughly the antiquities of Rome and Greece. 
In his account he does not follow slavishly his great original, Rich prizes 
are offered for the victors: a talent of silver, a cloak of gold embroidered, a 
shield richly wrought and others. In this contest the boat race which takes 
place between three crews has the chief place. To each of the contestants a 
prize is awarded. Next in order comes the footrace. The first prize is a 
horse richly caparisoned, and the second an “Amazonian quiver full of arrows;” 
the third prize is an Argolic helmet. Next comes the boxing match. A con- 
test with two entrants both redoubtable boxers, Dares and Entellus. The fight 
is described most minutely. The archery contest which concludes the games 
is almost the counterpart of the one described in Homer. 
These are followed by the Trojan games, a contest on horseback led by 
Tulus, the son of Aeneas. We do not know at what period in the history of 
Greece contests for boys began, but we shall find that when athletics had 
received a full development boys were given a prominent part in the contests, 
and places were made for them in the great festivals held at Olympia, Nemaea, 
Delphi, and on the Isthmus. 
The Homeric writings dealt mainly with princes, and were read at courts 
of nobles, but we gain glimpses later of the interest in manly sports of the rank 
and file, and the pictures in Herodotus and later in Theocritus assure us that 
these sports were by no means the monopoly of the great: 
During the period which follows the Trojan wars to the time of the Persian 
wars, we have some records of the development of athletics among the Greeks, 
and we are sure that it grew apace, and was liberally fostered by the Olympian 
games which were said to have been founded by Hercules, the great patron 
 
-P-A-G-E-188
    188 Proceedings of the Association of Colleges and 
of boxing. We must keep in mind further that there were annual festivals 
in almost every community, and these were training places for the athletes 
who in time were to bring honor to their state. The Spartans were much 
given to athletics, and certain sports they made their own especially. They 
excelled in running, and in throwing the dart. From an early time at Sparta 
these exercises were open to women. They too had their contests and took 
great interest in athletics. 
We have reflections of the heroic age, in the writings of the Romans, espe- 
cially Ovid, who in his Metamorphoses, gives us accounts of the foot-race of 
Atalanta, of the throwing of the discus and of other athletic exercise. 
If we had the complete Greek anthology, we would have much more knowl- 
edge of this important matter, for many of these poems, as we chance to 
know, were written to honor successful athletes. 
The Greeks of the age following Homer, and until the decline of Greece 
had a proper sense of proportion. They loved best an athlete who was fully 
developed and endowed with a sound mind in a beautiful body. For this 
reason they gave especial honor to the victor in the pentathlon. 
Before the Persian wars there had been for centuries athletic sports and 
athletic exercises among all the Greek peoples. Not only was this true of the 
Greeks of Attica, and the Peloponnesus, but of the far-flung colonies in Asia 
Minor and Italy. The Olympian games were said to have been established 
in 776 B. C., and these were later followed by the three other great festivals. 
These games provided the climax for athletic activities, but only a relatively 
small number were ever proficient enough to become contestants in any of 
the great games. The bulk of the training came from the festivals held 
yearly in all the communities of Greece where athletic sports were cherished 
and athletic prowess highly valued. We must not suppose that prior to the 
Persian wars there had been developed any extensive system of organized 
athletics among the Greeks; all of their sports were still in the hands of 
amateurs, and while the contestants were not limited to men of high birth, 
they were perhaps in the majority. 
The Persian wars gave a great impulse to athletics. For the first time 
the Greeks found themselves facing a foreign foe, the most powerful in the 
world. They were unorganized, there were quarrels and bickerings between 
the various Greek states, and not even at this time when facing a foreign foe 
were the Spartans and Athenians able to sink their personal antipathies, and 
in this great struggle Sparta did not play a role worthy of her traditions, 
though we must not forget Thermopylae. Further, even the Athenians were 
divided, and found within their city walls a large and influential minority who 
favored submission to the Persian yoke. But in spite of all these disadvan- 
tages Greece conquered and drove into the sea her invaders. The battles of 
Marathon, Salamis, Thermopylae, and Platea are writ large upon the pages 
of history. There must have been some strong reason for the result; patriot- 
ism alone was not sufficient to explain it. The Persians had an army that 
outnumbered the Greeks ten to one. They had trained and disciplined troops.
-P-A-G-E-189

The Greeks had engaged in wars among themselves, but many who joined 
issue with the Persians had never been in battle. The secret of their success 
lay largely in the athletic training which nearly every young Greek had had 
from early boyhood. They had been trained to run in the short-distance and 
long-distance races, they had learned endurance from boxing and wrestling, 
they had learned to wield the bow, and the spear, and to hurl the discus well 
across the mark. It was this training coupled with the love which the Greek 
felt for the father-land that gave victory in the most momentous struggle which 
the world had witnessed up to that time. 
We note parallels in modern history. The battle of Crecy was won by the 
English bowmen, who had not been trained in the technique of war-fare, but 
who were endowed with hearts of oak, and had handled from boy-hood the 
bow of tough English yew. The village lad contended with the noble and 
won because of his superior training in the out-of-doors. The Duke of Wel- 
lington is said to have stated that the battle of Waterloo was won on the 
cricket fields of Eton. In the World War America called millions of youths 
who -had never handled arms, but many of these boys had played baseball 
from early youth, and thousands of them had indulged in athletic sports in 
school and college. In consequence, military training advanced rapidly; hun- 
dreds of thousands of troops were sent into battle after a scant six months 
training, and sometimes less. Officers were made in three months when it 
had been supposed that four years were needed to properly train a young 
soldier to command his fellows. The same thing was true in England and 
her colonies, for in these countries, as in America, there had been little mili- 
tary training for the rank and file. And they fought side by side with French 
troops who had had years of military training. They fought against German 
troops who had borne arms from their youth, for prior to the world war en- 
forced military training extending through several years was required of every 
young German fit to bear arms. We know the sequel; the young American 
did not suffer by comparison with his French comrade, or his German foe. 
It would have been impossible to have gotten the same results in the same 
time if these boys had not had extensive athletic training, systematic or 
otherwise. 
It would seem then that among the Greeks extensive athletic training wrought 
their salvation. The boy was habituated from youth to the care of his body. 
He was taught not merely in the home but through his athletic training to be 
courageous, and to endure, to be helpful to his comrades, and to be abstemi- 
ous in eating and drinking. 
The value of the training which the Athenian and other Greek youths had 
had was borne in upon all of Greece by the successes that had attended their 
arms in the Persian wars; and poets, generals, law-makers, and private citizens 
vied with each other in honoring the athlete. The flowering period of Greek 
athletics lay between the Persian and Peloponnesian wars. ‘The friezes of 
the Parthenon give us many splendid examples of these youths. We have 
presented to us faces of a high order of intelligence, as well as forms of ideal 
symmetry and beauty. The doctrine of athletics was preached from the house-
-P-A-G-E-190
190 Proceedings of the Association of Colleges and 
tops, as was the case in America in the nineties of the last century. Youths 
were encouraged to compete for their own sakes, for the sake of the city. and 
lastly for the sake of Greece. The national festivals were celebrated with a 
magnificence that had been hitherto unknown, and Greek youths came often 
from distant shores, from Croton, Tarentum and Sybaris, from Alexandria, 
from Corinth, and from the islands of the Aegean to take part in the con- 
tests. We note now as was rarely the case in the earlier period that capital 
contests were won by men of lowly station, by fishermen, and even by cooks. 
It would take us too far afield to undertake to give an account of all of the 
great festivals that stood at the apex. But in the “big four,’ one stood 
supreme, the Olympian held at Olympia in Elis every four years. To win the 
crown of wild olive in the festival was to win the highest honor that could 
come to any athlete. 
The Elians were the patrons of this festival held in honor of Olympian 
Zeus. In the midst of the sacred precinct was the altar of Zeus, and not far 
away the Pelopion, sacred to Pelops, the hero associated from early times with 
the games. The story runs that he was the son of Tantalos, and had come 
hither to risk his life in a chariot race against Oinamaus, king of Elis, in 
order to win as his bride fair Laodamia, the daughter of the king, and either 
by the swiftness of the horses or by the aid of Laodamia, in whose eyes he 
had won favor, he won the race and the hand of the fair bride. Of him 
Pindar wrote in his first Olympian—“Thirteen lovers hath Oinamaus slain, and 
still delayeth to give his daughter in marriage. Now a great peril alloweth not 
of a coward; and forasmuch as men must die, wherefore should one sit vainly 
in the dark through a dull and nameless age, and without any noble deeds? 
Not so, I will dare this strife: do thou give the issue I desire.” Thus spake 
Pelops, “Nor were his words in vain; for the gods made him a glorious gift 
of a golden car and winged untiring steeds: so he overcame Oinamaus and 
won the maiden for his bride.” We find then that in Elis the beginning of 
the chariot race goes back to the twilight period of the race. 
The temple of Zeus was richly adorned with sculpture, and while the build- 
ing has been for ages in ruins, the remains of these sculptures have been col- 
lected with pious care by the Germans. The east front showed 21 colossal 
figures by Paeonius. It represented the moment before the chariot race be- 
tween Oinamaus and Pelops. On the west front we find figured the fight of the 
Lapithae and Centaurs, and on the metopes the labors of Hercules. We find 
here also temples to Hera, and the Mother of the Gods, with twelve treasure 
houses erected by twelve Greek states. Olympia was not merely a sanctuary, 
but the center of a league, and the spiritual capital of Greece in an even 
grester sense than Delphi. The stadium lay to the east of the Altis. Its 
shape was oblong, and it was enclosed. Here were held the contests in boxing, 
wrestling, leaping, throwing the discus, javelin throwing, and the pancra- 
tium. It would seem that at no time were seats provided as in the modern 
stadium, but it has been calculated that over 40,000 spectators could witness 
the contests from the neighboring slopes. The region is one of great natural 
beauty. The site for the stadium was the valley of the Alpheus. To the east 
 
-P-A-G-E-191

lay the ranges of Erymanthus and Cyllene in Arcadia, during many months of 
the year covered with snow. We are not surprised at the praise which is 
accorded it by Greek writers. Lysias calls it “fairest place in Hellas.” Per- 
haps the nearest modern parallel is a great foot-ball game between two rival 
colleges with their thousands of alumni waiting breathless upon the issue of 
the struggle. But this gives us but a faint idea of what these contests meant. 
To begin with, they lasted much longer, for five days, and we must remember 
that the victor or rather the contestant stood not alone or for his state; he 
represented the past with a long line of ancestors, and the thought of the 
victory for him, as important as that was, was much less prominent than was 
the thought of what he brought to his state and to his ancestors. We see this 
side of the Olympian victories exemplified in the odes of Pindar. Little is said 
about the individual victor as a rule, but the emphasis is placed rather upon 
the meaning of the victory for his state, and for his fellows. Thus in the 
Olympian games is emphasized the altruistic, and not the egotistic point of 
view. We must regard them at their best as a nursery for patriotism and for 
religion. The Greeks too often engaged in internecine strifes, but during the 
whole period of the festival and for a month before and afterwards, a “truce 
of God” was declared. All wars ceased, and all Greeks might go and come 
with no fear of being molested. The managers were armed with power to 
carry out their decrees, and when the Spartans violated this law they were 
heavily fined, and the money was set apart for a sacred used. The spirit of 
nationalism was kept aglow by these quadrennial meetings. And as none but 
pure Greeks could contest, the family record was carefully scanned. We find 
that even Themistocles was not allowed in the games because his mother was 
a Carian, and that the blood of Alexander himself was questioned, proud 
conqueror though he was. It is interesting to note that during the period fol- 
lowing the Persian wars there was an intimate union of athletics and physical 
prowess with literature in its flower. Pindar wrote his greatest odes to cele- 
brate victors in the Olympian and other great games, and so did Bacchylides. 
Herodotus is said to have read his histories at the Olympian games. The odes 
were chanted to a musical accompaniment, and at a number of these festivals 
there were contests in music and in poetry, and plays were given. Pindar 
writes his fourth Pythian in honor of a victor in a musical contest. 
The spirit of the games is reflected in the figures of the athletes which have 
come down to us from this early time, and in the figures of the gods for whom 
no doubt some of these youthful victors sat as models. Most of the great 
statues have perished but happily the figures from some portions of the Par- 
thenon, from the temple of Zeus at Olympia, the Hermes of Praxiteles, the 
Discobolus after Myron, are quite sufficient to show the beauty of the form of 
these young athletes. The ideal was the development of a beautiful body as 
a fit dwelling place for a soul that was strong, and self-contained. The char- 
acter of the men who took part in these contests is reflected, in the main, no 
doubt truthfully, in the Odes of Pindar. He is a stern teacher and stands for 
righteousness on the part of the individual, and for a life of self denial, and 
hard work. The young athlete had won his crown by many years of toil, and  
-P-A-G-E-192

by continuous training for months before entering upon the games. We find, 
however, that he contested for no splendid rewards of gold, or kine as was 
the case in Homeric days. We may say then that these games, followed from 
the earliest times and flowering in the four great contests, moulded the Greeks 
as perhops did no other single agency, and that the influences from the games 
were in the main good, good in their effects upon the bodies and minds of the 
young contestants. They served to give to the Greeks a feeling of pride for 
their race, and they were most broadening, for here they met and conversed 
with men from the furthest corners of the Greek world. They served, too, to 
call attention to the fact that the great prizes were not alone for princes; many 
victors were of humble birth, but they none the less were honored by the 
whole state when they returned to their homes. 
When the Olympian games were first instituted, it is doubtful whether there 
was a gymnasium or palaestra in Greece. They trained in the open, and 
bathed their tired bodies in some convenient stream. But prior to the Per- 
sian wars the various towns of Greece began to establish their gymnasia, and 
palaestrae for training their youths in bodily exercises. These two terms are 
sometimes used interchangeably, but the palaestra was primarily a place for 
wrestling, while the gymnasium had a broader content. We have the remains 
of some of these and descriptions of them, with frequent references occur- 
ring in both Greek and Roman writings. Vitruvius, the Roman architect, 
gives us quite a detailed account of the gymnasium. From these various 
sources, while all the details may not be perfectly clear, we can form an in- 
telligent idea of the gymnasium in most of its aspects. We are further aided 
in this matter by our knowledge of Roman baths. A number of these, no- 
tably the ones at Pompeii, are still in existence, and undoubtedly certain im- 
portant features of these have been taken from the Greek gymnasia. We are 
further aided by the numerous representations of scenes in the gymnasia 
which are found on Greek vases of different periods. They consisted of an 
enclosed area, like the peristyle of the Roman house, around which there ran 
colonnades; and off from these were a number of rooms which were used for 
the various purposes attendant upon the athlete’s needs; In the more devel- 
oped period there were showers, plunge baths, and hot baths, with rooms for 
undressing and oiling their bodies. It may be stated that oil was freely used 
both before and after the bath. Athens had a number of these, among them 
being the Lyceum and the Academy. These gymnasia afforded ample space 
for most of the contests. Within the enclosure there were probably held the 
exercises in boxing, wrestling, the pancratium and jumping, while without 
occurred the throwing of the discus, the hurling of the javelin and running. 
‘We must not suppose that these gymnasia were as complete or elaborate as 
those which even modest colleges feel that they must have for ‘their students 
today. The Greek ideal with reference to this matter, as in regard to educa- 
tion, was that the two main factors were the teacher and the student, and 
that other details, though they were not to be neglected, were much less im- 
portant. It is interesting to note here the union of letters and athletics as at 
the great contests. These gymnasia were frequented by philosophers and
-P-A-G-E-193
  Secondary Schools of the Southern States 193 
teachers, and here chosen youths, the very ones who took part in athletics, 
were also the zealous pupils of devoted teachers. In one of these Plato lec- 
tured and from it his school took the name of the Academy. Raphael’s paint- 
ing represents them listening to the philosopher. In another, the Lyceum, 
Aristotle met his students. 
The close connection between zeal for learning and athletics existed in 
America at an earlier day to a greater degree than today. We recall a time 
not very distant when a winning foot-ball team numbered among its players, 
some fifteen in all, only two who failed to graduate; all of the others were 
earnest students, and today they fill places of honor all over the country. One 
is Dean of the Law School in his Alma Mater, another represents his state 
in the nation’s senate, another is in congress. The fullback on that team is 
on the supreme bench of his state, and one of the halves, a leading lawyer 
in another state. These young Spartans were up each morning at six-thirty, 
and after half an hour in the gymnasium, took a three-mile run. 
We are not left in doubt as to the extent and thoroughness of the Greek 
training. The diet as well as the character of the exercises was carefully 
looked after. Their trainers were evidently martinets for a number of exam- 
ples from the vases show them rod in hand ready to punish severely the 
luckless youth who failed to come up to the required standard. 
During the earlier period as exemplified by the heroes of Homer there was 
no special diet for the athlete. The usual diet was very similar to that of 
the Finns who were so successful in the Olympian games recently. The ath- 
lete was mainly a vegetarian and subsisted largely on dried figs, and no doubt 
other fruits, with, cheese and porridge, and meat rarely. Later we find the 
introduction of an extensive meat diet in order to produce bulk for such con- 
tests as wrestling, and boxing. Pork, beef, and fish of different kinds were 
extensively eaten. The ancient trainers even had the usual superstitions with 
reference to particular types of pork. Their pork must come from pigs fed 
only on cornel nuts and acorns and not raised in the neighborhood of sea or 
rivers. We find that with some the eating of cranes was supposed to be 
most efficacious, this diet perhaps for the runners. The ideal of the earlier 
training was to produce a harmonious development of the whole body. Such 
training as this the youths must have had who sat as models, for Pheidias, 
Myron, and Polycleitus, and we are fortunate to have these men show us in 
undying marble and bronze the forms and faces of these youths of this golden 
age in the world’s athletics. It is impossible to judge from the appearance 
of the athlete as tothe form of contest in which he was pre-eminent, conse- 
quently we find him often presented grasping the discus, or holding the hal- 
teres. The heads are as shapely as their bodies. _The look is thoughtful, and 
the forehead and all the features indicate acute intelligence. Such youths as 
these brought glory to Greece in the major contests at the four great festi- 
vals during the first half of the fifth century. The usual trainer was the 
paidotribes who had charge of the boy from the seventh to the twentieth year; 
but as a rule, he was not skillful enough to prepare the youth for success in 
the great games. He had in addition special training from some one who

means a feeling for the respect due the gods, one’s fellows, and one’s self. 
“It is the spirit of reverence, modesty and courtesy.” It is the sense of honor, 
a quality which when inspiring the athlete, distinguishes him from the bully, 
and the true soldier from the “miles gloriosus.” Pindar calls the possessor of 
this quality a “straight fighter.” “One who walks in the straight path, and 
abhors insolence.” “The nemesis to success in athletics is specialization; spe- 
cialization begets professionalism, and professionalim is the death of all true 
sport.” 
We search in vain for a parallel in modern times to these contests. The 
contestants had from early youth taken an active part in athletic sports. They 
must be of pure blood, and above reproach. There must be no fouling, no 
winning of the victory by any but fair means. With them came many of their 
fellow citizens, their friends, and their family to wish them God speed. One 
feature of these contests was distinctive. They must not only be successful, 
but their “form” had to be above reproach. This element is largely disre- 
garded in all of our sports today except golf. They engaged in all of these 
contests with their bodies bare, and every muscle was noted by the onlookers, 
and the body of the athlete must please as well as his skill. 
The order in which the contests occurred is not certainly known, but it 
seems likely that in the major contests running came first; then the jump, 
throwing the discus, hurling the javelin, and wrestling. We are not certain 
when the contests in boxing took place, but it was regarded as one of the 
important events. The establishing of records was not the end then, as it is 
today, and it is likely that we have modern athletes who could have bested 
these Greek athletes in the various contests. Out of the twenty-five athletic 
odes of, Pindar, six celebrate the victor in the foot race. This contest was 
highly honored. They were started by the herald giving the order to go, or 
sometimes by the blast of the trumpet. Their rules were strict. And Adi- 
mantas, the Corinthian general, says to Themistocles, “In the games, those 
who start before the time are beaten with stripes.” The position in starting 
is shown on several vase paintings and by statuettes which have survived. 
The eyes of the runner look straight ahead, the body bends forward from the 
waist, the left arm at the side, with hand touching the hip, the right arm 
stretched forward almost at right angles to the body, legs bent at the knee, 
and the left foot forward. They had the stade race, about two hundred yards, 
the diaulon, about four hundred yards, and the long-distance race. The run- 
ners were separated from each other by posts placed in a stone sill, and simi- 
lar posts marked the finish or turning point, In spite of strict rules, fouling 
sometimes occurred. Vergil tells us that in this race Nisus tripped Salius. 
They sometimes interfered with each other by holding, and other unfair prac- 
tices, though they were strictly forbidden by rule and were in violation of the 
oath which they had taken. The posts probably served as guides for the 
runners, and it has been suggested that each post was distinguished by a spe- 
cial sign or color. We know that in the stade race each runner made straight 
for his finishing post. In the other races it seems likely that the runner raced 
for his own post and then turning round it, raced back over the same ground.
-P-A-G-E-195

was master of the particular sport in which he desired to excel. We find 
that the Spartans gave athletic training to all of their youths of both sexes. 
They did not allow them, however, to have a trainer in wrestling, and pro- 
hibited their citizens from taking part in boxing or the pancratium on the 
grounds that it was disgraceful for a Spartan to have to acknowledge defeat. 
It would seem that this was a protest of Sparta against the growing spirit 
of professionalism, and their names disappear from the list of the Olympian 
victors. Sparta then did not follow the rest of Greece when she gave herself 
up in the latter part of the fifth century and thereafter to highly specialized 
athletics, and Philostratus comparing the Spartans with the other athletes 
adjudged them boorish; but looking at it from this angle, we are inclined to 
believe that the Spartans were right. We have little information upon the de- 
ails of training for the various events, but we know that the gymnasia at 
Delphi and Olympia had running tracks corresponding in length to the actual 
stadia, and that at Olympia they were provided with grooved starting sills. 
To gain endurance we are told that they ran in heavy sand. Aristotle tells us 
that they sometimes ran on their knees, and Epictetus, that the training of the 
long-distance runner was different from that of the sprinter in its regulations 
as to diet and massage. 
Philostratus says that the long-distance runner would not go over the whole 
course but would run only about eight or ten stades daily. Athletes of the 
ancient days, as is the case with their modern brothers, were not without their 
pet superstitions. To prevent stitch, some runners would wear a girdle of 
horses’ teeth. We must bear in mind that under the Greek system every 
boy, no matter what his station, received thorough physical training. The 
training consisted partly in the practice of the traditional exercises and partly 
dances to the accompaniment of music. These evolutions in some cases were 
the same which they would go through with in actual war. At Olympia at 
first there were only two divisions of athletes, boys and men; but we find in 
the sixth century a third class, that of youths. If an athlete had contended 
in the games and reached his early thirties without a crown, he was pro- 
hibited from taking further part in the contests, for it was believed that he 
could never, win. Pindar thus sums up for us the ideal: “If one be born 
with excellent gifts, then may another who sharpeneth his natural edge, speed 
him, God helping, to an exceeding weight of glory. Without toil there have 
triumphed very few.” Cato says of the orator: “He is a good man speak- 
ing eloquently.” According to Pindar, “the victor is transfigured into a glori- 
ous personification of his race, and the present is magnified, illumined in the 
mirror of the mythic past.” The athlete with him, then, is the brave man 
acting nobly. Goodness must be the basic quality in both according to these 
gifted men—and they were right. The desire for victory was not selfish or 
personal; as already noted in Pindar’s odes the praise of the victor does not 
furnish the main theme. The victor has reflected glory on his ancestors and 
his city, and shares in it only as one of a number of copartners, some of 
them more important than he. The Greeks of this time believed that an es- 
sential quality in the athlete was “aidos.” The word is hard to define, but
-P-A-G-E-196
  196 Proceedings of the Association of Colleges and 
The different districts of Greece excelled in different forms of athletics. The 
Spartans and Arcadians during the period of free Greece seemed to have ex- 
celled the rest in running. Ageus, who won the long race at Olympia, is said 
to have carried the news of his victory to Argos on the same day, and Drumos, 
the news of his Olympic victory from Elis to Epidaurus, a distance of nearly 
ninety miles in a single day. Another interesting race was run in armor. 
This seems to have been introduced at the close of the sixth century. It 
was primarily a military exercise, and the results of this training were shown 
in the battles between the Greeks and the Persians| when they made forced 
marches that had been adjudged impossible by their enemies. The torch race 
was very popular, and was held at many points in Greece. This race took 
place at night. There were two principal varieties, one between individuals, 
and the other between teams. At the festival of the Panathenea each year, 
a torch race took place at Athens. The starting point was the altar of Pro- 
metheus in the Academy, and they raced into the city. The one who arrived 
first, with his torch alight, was proclaimed the victor. The race was not 
without a comic element, for as the runners stooped to keep their torches 
burning, they afforded much amusement to the onlookers and provided the 
same sort of amusement as that which comes from a potato race today. In 
the team race, the members of the team were posted at convenient intervals, 
and the team which first came in with burning torch was proclaimed the 
victor. Aristophanes speaks of the torch racing and hunting as the fashion- 
able amusements of the smart youths in his day. 
In modern athletics the jump has a very important place. We have the 
running broad jump, the standing jump, and the pole vault. Jumping consti- 
tuted a very important feature in Greek athletics, but in their formal contests 
they did not have all of the various types that are so much in evidence with 
us. In Homeric times there seems to! be no evidence of jumping in formal 
athletic contests. There is probably little doubt that in their informal athletic 
contests the Greeks practiced all the forms of jumping that are familiar to us. 
They probably had the running jump, the broad jump, and the jump with the 
pole, corresponding to pole vault of today. We know that they jumped on 
horses in this fashion. But in their formal athletics contests, jumping seems to 
have been confined to the broad jump. This jump was made either standing 
or by a short run. From the beginning they seem to have regularly used 
halteres, jumping weights corresponding to the modern dumb bells. We have 
many representations of these devices upon painted vases, and a number of 
them have come down to us. They differed considerably as to size, weight, 
and the material of which they were constructed. We have an inscribed 
“halter” which was found at Eleusis. It is an oblong piece of lead about 
four and a half inches in length and seven and a half broad, with the sides 
slightly concave, and weighs about four pounds. On the earliest vases the 
halter seems to have been a semicircular piece of metal or stone with a deep 
recess on the lower side in order to afford a convenient grip. We find in 
the fifth century another type. It was a semispherical block of metal or stone 
thickest in the middle. pointed or rounded. The vases show us clearly how
-P-A-G-E-197
  Secondary Schools of the Southern States 197 
the halteres were used. The principle is the same as that which is practiced 
today in the standing jump. The halteres are swung forward and upward 
until they are level with or higher than the head, and then downwards, at 
the same time bending the body until the hands are just below the knees. 
The actual jump takes place on the return swing. 
Lucian tells us of athletes in the gymnasium jumping up and down like 
runners but without moving from their places. This is an athletic exercise 
which is familiar to us all, and known today as knees up. Seneca calls this 
the fuller’s jump as it resembles the action of the fuller jumping up and down 
in his tub. The same process was practiced in pressing out the juice of the 
grape in the winepress. Note in the Bible, “he trod the winepress alone.” 
In the Lysistrata of Aristophanes the Spartan Lampito ascribes her complexion 
and figure to her athletic training, and mentions an exercise practiced today, 
that of kicking up the legs and striking the body behind with the heels. 
Hopping was a favorite amusement with the Greeks, and was no doubt prac- 
ticed as an athletic exercise, but formed no part in their formal contests. 
At the Dionysia there was a popular contest which consisted in hopping on 
a greased wineskin filled with wine. The prize was offered to the one who 
was able to remain on the skin. We are told that in northern Greece this 
contest exists today. Such contests introduced comic element into their 
sports, corresponding to the various burlesque contests which we have today, 
as baseball games in which the players appear habited in woman’s apparel. 
The Greeks jumped into a pit, the ground of which had been carefully dug 
up and softened. No jump was allowed to be measured unless the impress 
of the feet was regular. That is, if the jumper fell or stumbled, or one foot 
was in advance of the other the jump was thrown! out. It would seem that 
the length of the space into which the jump was made was fifty feet. We 
have the story of one Phayllus who jumped five feet beyond the skamma, and 
broke his leg. The “take off” was at the end of the skamma. It was marked 
by» spears or poles stuck up in the ground, sometimes by pillars similar to 
those in the running track. There is no evidence that the athletes used any 
kind of spring board. The using of weights added considerably to.the length 
of the jump. 
In Roman times the halteres were used as dumbbells. We have the details 
of such exercises pre served in the remains of medical writers. The importance 
given to these exercises for strengthening the trunk is noteworthy, and the 
careful representations of these muscles in Greek sculpture as in the torso of 
Hercules in the Vatican museum show that they were developed to a remark- 
able degree. The halteres seemed to have come into general use about the 
time of the Persian wars. 
The throwing of the discus seems to have been one of the oldest sports of 
the Greeks, and like many of their other contests was doubtless practiced in 
some primitive form by their Achaean ancestors. We find similar athletic 
exercises practiced by the early Germans and English. Among the Greeks the 
discus throw goes back not only to the early but the heroic period of the 
race. At the games of Patroclus they hurled a metal mass called the “solos.”
-P-A-G-E-198
    198 Proceedings of the Association of Colleges and 
It seems to have meant originally a boulder or mass of iron. But the discus 
was certainly known to Homer, and the discus throw was well known as a 
measure of distance. The material of which it was made in Homeric days 
was either stone or metal, usually bronze. We are told that in heroic times 
Apollo when throwing the discus hit by accident his youthful friend Hya- 
cinthus and killed him. The story is beautifully told for us by Ovid. Apollo 
deserted Delphi, and spent his time in hunting with his fair friend; one day 
they stripped and anointing with oil amused themselves by hurling the discus. 
When the boy rushed forward to procure the discus, it rebounded, and hitting 
the youth upon the temple, inflicted a mortal blow. The god, though Aescu- 
lapius was his son, and he was a master of the healing art, could not cure 
him, though he took him tenderly in his arms, and tried to staunch the flow 
of the lifeblood as it trickled from,the wound. He reproached himself, and 
when he found that he could not restore the boy, he saw to it that his name 
should live always in song. “And lo, where the red blood flowed out upon 
the earth there sprang up a splendid purple flower with a form like a lily, 
a memorial of the‘sun god’s mourning. And as often as the spring drives 
away the winter, so often are these flowers fresh in the fields. Hyacinthus 
rises again.” The later discus .was uniformly of bronze, and a number of 
exemplars have been found. They were circular disks of metal, and varied 
considerably in size. The weight varied from three to twelve pounds. Some 
of these are ornamented, and some have names inscribed on them. It is quite 
usual to find concentric circles upon them. They sometimes, though not al- 
ways, have a hole in the center, and the scholiast tells us that they were 
thrown by a string; but this is a mistake as is shown by the attitude of the 
discobulus in the famous statue of Myron, and in other representations upon 
the vases, and statues which have survived. Since the revival of the Olympian 
games the throwing of the discus has become quite popular internationally. 
In America its weight is four and a half pounds, it is of a smooth hard wood 
body without finger holes and weighted in the center with lead disks. Its 
diameter is eight inches and the thickness at centre two inches. Statius gives 
us a full account of the throwing of the discus. The illustrations of this 
athletic exercise are rich and numerous, including vases, statues, statuettes, 
small bronzes, reliefs, coins and gems. From them we are able to gather much 
valuable information as to the exercise. A discus was found in Sicily in the 
neighborhood of Terra Nova. It is one of the largest. known specimens, of 
bronze covered with a thick patina. On one side is the, figure of a dolphin 
sunk in the bronze. This was originally filled with silver. This was probably 
from about 500 B. C. Throwing the discus became a very popular athletic 
contest, and constituted an essential feature in the pentathlon in the Olympian 
games. We are not able to determine the average weight of the Greek discus, 
but it seems certain that it was generally heavier than the one used today. 
With the modern discus we find that there are some very fine records estab- 
lished. In 1906 J. Sheridan threw 135 ft. 8 in., and in 1908, adopting the 
Greek style, he threw it 124 ft., 6 in. Among the Greeks, Phayllus is said to 
have thrown the discus 95 ft. The modern discobulus stands in a seven-foot
-P-A-G-E-199
Secondary Schools of the Southern States 199 
circle which may not be overstepped. About all that we learn from the pas- 
sage about the balbis in Philostratus is that it was marked off with a line in 
front and at the sides. The throw was measured from the front line of the 
balbis to the place where the discus fell. The thrower first !rubs the discus 
with sand to secure a firm grip, and then takes his stance in the balbis a 
little behind the front !line, measuring the space carefully with his eyes so as 
not to overstep the line. This exact moment is reproduced in the statue of the 
discobulus in the! Vatican. The thrower starts from this position and swings 
the quoit forward. The leg may either be kept stationary or moved forward, 
and the right hand is extended to the front ready to grasp the ‘discus when 
it comes forward. The movement is then consummated when the thrower 
grasps the discus, leaning backward preparing for the final swing. Another 
stance represents the thrower standing with the right foot forward and the 
discus in the left hand level with the head. We find this position represented 
by a fine bronze in the Metropolitan museum in New York. In heroic times 
the throwing of the discus was a separate event, and various gods and heroes 
excelled in it as has already been shown. It seems to have played an important 
part in the preliminary exercises in the gymnasia, It was always popular in 
Greece from early times, and won favor among the Romans, who did not 
have organized athletic contests to the same extent as thé Greeks, and were 
inclined to look down upon Greek athletics. Horace mentions the throwing 
of the discus as a manly exercise worthy of a young Roman of good blood. 
He blames Lydia for her influence over Sybaris: “Why fears he to touch 
the yellow Tiber? Why shuns he oil, used by wrestlers, more cautiously than 
blood of vipers? Wherefore neither doth he, who hath often acquired so 
much reputation by the ‘quoit and often by the javelin, having cleared the 
mark, any longer appear with arms all black and blue with martial exer- 
cises?” 
Javelin Throwing: Here, too, we have a very ancient form of athletic con- 
test, and one of very large practical value, for it trained the young Greek to 
skill in the use of a weapon that most of them were destined to use sometime 
during their lives in actual combat. Some have endeavored to trace it to 
Oriental sources, but we have no example of such contests in the monumental 
remains of Egypt or Assyria. This does not prove, however, that they did not 
have such contests; it is likely that they did, and did we know all the facts, 
it is likely that we would find that such contests were indulged in by the 
Ancient Mycenaeans, and the Cretans. But the urge in this direction which 
we see asserting itself so strongly among the Greeks came probably primar- 
ily from their Dorian ancestors, who brought the impulse with them from their 
former homes. There seem to have been two distinct forms in the classical 
period: one in which the spear was pointed upward, and the other in which 
it was held horizontally. Only the former type is represented on illustrations 
of athletic competitions. The vase paintings which we have of scenes from 
the palaestra show the javelins usually, with blunt points, and there is no 
sign of any target. In the Ode from Horace already referred to we have ref- 
erence to throwing the javelin. In a wall painting in the house of the Vettii  
-P-A-G-E-200
  200 Proceedings of the Association of Colleges and 
we have an example of Cupids indulging in throwing the javelin, but they 
are hurling it at a target. The weapon was about the height of a man. It 
was thrown by means of a thong which was fastened near the center. This 
was a detachable leather strap some 12 or 18 inches long. It was bound tight 
with a loop into which the thrower inserted his first and middle fingers. Many 
vases show us the method of casting. The thrower first extends his right arm 
back, and with the left hand opposite the right breast holds the spear. He 
then starts to run. We have two bronze statuettes in the Metropolitan mu- 
seum in New York representing pentathletes with the akontion. The first 
shows a youth standing with the weight of his body on the left foot, the right 
drawn slightly back. The left hand is held close to the side. The other 
represents a youth in the same position. with his weight on the left foot, the 
right drawn back. The arm hangs by the left side and in this the javelin 
was probably held. There is little doubt that in both these statues we have 
representations of javelin throwers, and they suggest the statues of Polycleitus, 
and may well be copies of originals by him. 
Representations of wrestling matches have been found in Egypt dating from 
2000 B. C., and we have examples in the sculptured remains at Beni Hasan 
near the Nile. It is certain that the art was practiced in Ninevah and Baby- 
lon, as well as in Egypt. This has led some to suppose that the art was in- 
troduced into Greece from the East. Hercules wrestled not alone with the 
Nemaean lion but with Antaeus, and the account of the wrestling match at 
the funeral games of Patroclus in the Iliad has already been mentioned. 
This sport was popular from a very early time with the European branch of 
the Indo-European family, and there is little doubt that it was brought into 
Greece from the North. The various holds and catches, as attested by the 
descriptions that have come down to us and the monumental remains, were 
very like those practiced in the East, and it is entirely possible that the 
sport was developed in Greece somewhat in accord with the rules that had 
come to them from older peoples. Wrestling seems to have been instituted at 
the Olympian games in 708. There were two sorts of wrestling in Greece, 
wrestling proper in which each tried to throw his antagonist, bringing his 
shoulder to the ground three times out of five, and ground wrestling. This 
contest was continued on the ground, and everything was allowed except 
gouging and biting. Recently a papyrus has been discovered of the second 
century A. D. which contains brief instructions for wrestling lessons. It in- 
dicates the various movements, grips, and throws, and serves to make clearer 
the various positions that are on the vases and wall paintings, and appear in 
statues. The vases are most helpful to us in illustrating the throws. Addi- 
tional light comes from coins. In the Aethiopica of Heliodorus we have an 
excellent account of a wrestling match. This is.a Greek prose romance. An 
Amphora from Vulci, a town of Etruria, shows two positions. In the central 
group the wrestler holds the left wrist of his opponent with his right hand. 
The latter, however, has been on the alert, and passing his right arm behind 
his opponent’s back grabs his right arm just below the elbow. In this way 
he keeps his adversary from turning around. In the group of wrestlers to
-P-A-G-E-201
Secondary Schools of the Southern States 201 
the right we have another aspect of the game. Two men are engaged, an 
older man and a youth. The youth has lifted his adversary from the ground. 
He holds him up with his arms around his body. But the defeated man has 
not yet given up, he is grasping his adversary’s arms, and has passed his foot 
between his legs. Some interesting scenes are shown on a kylix now in the 
museum of the University of Pennsylvania. Here we see two youths stooping 
in the contest. They are both bent low, and one is grasping the arm of the 
other. The Metropolitan museum has a bronze cista, a jewelry box, which 
represents two nude wrestlers. Their bodies are inclined towards each other, 
their heads touching, and their arms locked behind their heads. It would 
seem that even after athletics had become corrupted by professionalism, wrest- 
ling for the most part was kept free from brutality. The instructor enforced 
his discipline as in the other sports with the rod. The number of competi- 
tors varied. Pindar’s heroes, the Aeginetan wrestlers, were each victorious 
over four rivals. They dusted their bodies with sand before the contest began. 
‘This was done to render the grip more difficult, as the body had been first 
covered with oil. Sometimes a famous athlete had a “walkover,” and he was 
then said to conquer without dust. An epigram of Cleitomachus tells that 
Milo, advancing for the crown after a dustless victory, slipped and fell upon 
his hip, whereupon the sovereign people cried out no crown for a man who 
had fallen without a contest. When both wrestlers in a contest fell together 
it seems to have been declared a draw. Seneca says that a wrestler thrice 
thrown lost the prize. The attitude taken by the wrestlers seems to have been 
generally that adopted today. We have this position illustrated in the two fine 
bronzes in the Naples museum taken from Pompeii. They, face each other 
with shoulders bent forward, right hands forward, left further back, intently 
watching each other and waiting for an opening. The neckhold was very 
much used, and an effective body hold was obtained by catching both wrists 
of the opponent. A favorite throw was the flying mare as it was called. 
The victim was swung off his feet and then hurled over the shoulders of his 
opponent. We find that even among the Greeks there were many different 
styles of wrestling, but the festivals served to produce a certain uniformity, 
and there seems little doubt that the rules and style of wrestling adopted at 
Olympia set the pace for the rest of Greece. 
Boxing was practiced in Crete in Aegean days. Boxing matches are de- 
scribed in both the Iliad and Odyssey. It is older than the period of heroic 
poetry in Greece, dating back to the mythological period. In the Iliad Apollo 
appears as the god of boxing, and he is said to have been beaten by Ares at 
Olympia in a boxing contest. One of the Dioscuri was a noted boxer, and, as 
has been seen, Odysseus was an adept at the sport. It would seem that the 
contest for men was introduced at Olympia in 688, and for boys in 616. The 
Greeks boxed at times with ungloved hands; such a contest is described as 
taking place between Odysseus and Irus, but in the contests at the Olympian 
games, gloves were used. They are described as “soft gloves,” but they were 
far from soft. They relly consisted of leathern thongs which were wound 
around the hands and wrists and far up the arms but left the thumbs and 
 
-P-A-G-E-202
202 Proceedings of the Association of Colleges and 
the ends of the fingers free. They served to protect the knuckles and to 
increase the power of the blow. These thongs seemed to have heen from ten 
to twelve feet in length. They are shown in many statues and vase paintings. 
We see them hanging upon the walls, held in the hands, or bound upon the 
hand. There was another type called the “sharp gloves.” They seem to have 
consisted of two parts, the glove proper, and a hard leather ring around the 
knuckles. This glove extends well up the forearm, and ends in a thick strip 
of fleece to protect the arm. On the knuckles the glove is provided with a 
thick pad. This prevents the ring which encircles the fingers from slipping 
down. This ring is made of hard, stiff leather, and is kept in place by straps 
around the wrist. It is about half an inch thick, and its sharp projecting 
edges render it a dangerous and effective weapon. These gloves, which took 
the place of the lighter ones, continued in use for many centuries. The hold- 
ing of contests in which the contestants are armed with these gloves is re- 
ferred to by many writers, and they are seen on numerous statues. It is the 
cestus but without metallic reinforcement.. The cestus, made more formidable 
by the use of lead, seems to have been a Roman invention. To the end of 
the fifth century, the soft glove seems to have been generally used. The 
best example of the heavier gloves that we have is on the statue of the seated 
boxer in the Terme Museum at Rome. The last representation in art of this 
sort of glove appears on a Roman relief in the Lateran Museum, and dates 
from the time of Trajan. Boxing seems to have been the most popular of all 
the sports. Pausanias mentions 192 monuments to Olympian victors, and 56 
of these were erected to victorious boxers—boys and men. We have three 
distinct periods. in ancient boxing; the soft thongs extending from the Homeric 
period to some time in the fifth century, then the “sharp thongs,” and finally, 
the weighted cestus. For the first period we have the evidence of Homer 
and the painted vases of the sixth and fifth centuries; for the second, some 
painted vases, the statue in the Terme already referred to, Theocritus, and 
Apollonius Rhodius, and for the last, Vergil and other Roman poets. 
In Greek boxing there was no regular ring; the boxer was given ample 
space and so could not corner his adversary. There were no rounds. The 
contestants fought to a finish. If both were exhausted they would pause by 
mutual consent to take breath, but the fight usually went on until one could 
fight no longer. Classification into light and heavy weights seemed to have 
been unknown to the Greeks; as a result boxing became more and more the 
monopoly of the heavy weights, and less and less scientific, Brawn triumphed 
over skill. The vases show us the position of the Greek boxer in the begin- 
ning. He stands with body erect, feet well apart, and the left foot advanced. 
The left arm which is:used for guarding is extended and almost straight; 
the hand is sometimes closed and sometimes open. The right arm is drawn 
back for striking. In the Munich “Glyptotek” we have a fine representation 
ofyan athlete.. He is an athlete every inch, and his pose is that of the boxer. 
He seems to be standing facing his adversary, and the position of the legs 
is as described, but the left arm is bent at the elbow, and the right arm is 
at his side. The fingers on both hands are bent but they have not as_yet
-P-A-G-E-203
  Secondary Schools of the Southern States 203 
been doubled up closely in anticipation of the blow which is to be struck, 
In the Louvre we have bronzes of Poseidon and Apollo, who were both great 
boxers, in this same position, There probably were body blows used in the 
contests, but the chief blows seem to have been aimed at the head. Philostratus 
seems to imply that blows were confined to the head. He says that boxing 
was invented by the Spartans, because they did not wear helmets, and that 
they practiced boxing in order to learn to ward off blows from the head and 
to protect the face. We have no copy of the boxing rules. The Greeks may 
have barred body blows at their festivals, or they may have been taboo by 
virtue of a tradition against them. Most of the vases would lead us to sup- 
pose that the left hand was used only for guarding, but both Homer and Theo- 
critus testify to the force and effect of the left hand blow. It is safe to 
assume that the Greek boxer used the left hand frequently for attack, and 
administered with it some of his most effective blows. There appeared to be 
no rule against hitting a man when he was down; the fight continued until 
one of the contestants raised his finger or hand in token of defeat. 
Perhaps the best account that we have of an ancient boxing match is found 
in Theocritus. The heroes under Jason have landed from their ship, and 
Polydeuces with Castor have wandered away from the rest. They are thirsty 
and beneath a lofty cliff they espy a spring of water, crystal clear. Around 
it are fair trees, white poplars, planes and cypresses, and there bloom fragrant 
flowers, and among them flit the toilsome bees. But the spring is guarded by 
a monstrous man of hairy aspect. Polydeuces greets him courteously and 
asks for water, but it is denied. He then offers to purchase it, but gets the 
uncivil reply from Amycus: “Put up thy hands and stand in single combat 
man to man.” Polydeuces is ready for the combat and says: “A boxing 
match, or is kicking fair, when we meet eye to eye?” Amycus replies: “Do 
thy best with thy fists, and spare not thy skill.” “And the champions, when 
they had strengthened their fists with the stout ox-skin gloves, and bound 
leathern thongs about their arms, stepped into the ring, breathing slaughter 
against each other.” 
The companions of the two had been summoned, and stand as interested 
witnesses of the contest. Amycus is the stronger; he is the bully, but as we 
follow the fight our sympathies go out to the young hero of the Greeks, so 
brave, but yet ever so courteous. He moves about with agility and secures an 
initial advantage by getting his back to the sun. He directs his blows at 
mouth and jaws, and teases his adversary by often feinting. Now he plants 
a heavy blow on the bridge of the nose, and stretches him on the ground. 
He does not seem to strike when he is down, and when Amycus rises, fierce 
fighting starts anew. He keeps hitting on the neck and chest, while Polydeuces 
continues to smash him in the face with telling blows. The giant now with 
his left hand grasps Polydeuces’ left, and drives in with a huge blow with his 
right, but the hero ducks and thus avoids the blow directed at his head. He 
then follows with a strong blow with the right, putting his shoulder into it, 
and strikes Amycus on the left temple, and then quickly his him in the mouth 
with his left. The giant was then all “in” and he rained blows upon his face
-P-A-G-E-204
204 Proceedings of the Association of Colleges and 
until he felled him to the earth. From the ground he held out both his hands 
to show that he could fight no longer. 
There is a contest old as the race. We see it today when the child is angry. 
He gets his adversary down if he can, after grappling with him, and bites 
him, punches him or kicks him. The Pancratium grew out of this natural 
mode of fighting. It was very popular as a part of the contests of the Greeks 
at their various festivals. It does not seem to have been introduced into the 
great festivals as early as boxing and wrestling, but once introduced, kept a 
great hold on the populace. It has been thought of by many moderns as very 
brutal, and so it would have been unless governed by rules. The same may 
be said of foot-ball, and many other modern athletic exercises. It resembled 
the Japanese jiu-jitsu, and was a sort of systematic rough-and-tumble fight. 
A combination of boxing and wrestling, it was carried on both standing and 
on the ground. Gouging and biting were barred. Gloves were not used and 
Philostratus refers to it as the fairest of all contests. However, it sometimes 
resulted fatally. Vase paintings show us many of the grips and throws of 
the pancratium. “The flying mare,” leg hold, getting the neck into “chan- 
cery,” the stomach throw, done by putting the foot in the stomach of the 
adversary, and then throwing him over the head. Plato banishes it from his 
ideal republic, not on account of its cruelty, but because he says that the 
exercises of the pancratium are not helpful in preparing the soldier for battle. 
A favorite trick of the pancratiast was to catch his antagonist by the foot, and 
lifting him up, to tilt him backwards. Antaeus is frequently depicted in his 
struggle with Hercules as attempting to catch hold of his foot. A wrestler 
when thrown on his back was defeated, but a pancratiast might intentionally 
fall on his back in order to give his adversary a harder throw, or to procure 
some other advantage over him. Kicking was a distinctive feature of this 
contest, and Galen in his skit on the Olympian games awards the prize of the 
“pankration” to the donkey because he excels all animals in kicking. Pau- 
sanias tells of a Pancratiast, Sostratus, who forced his opponents to yield by 
twisting and breaking their fingers. On engraved gems we have many ex- 
amples of these contests, showing the athletes struggling on the ground. The 
so-called wrestlers in the Ufizzi gallery in Florence are in reality Pancratiasts. 
This is the most famous representation of this contest which we have. The 
figures go back to the best period of Greek art. One of the contestants has 
been forced to the ground, and rests on his knees and hands; the other is 
astride of him, and is holding him down with his left arm while his right is 
drawn back to strike. 
This contest is found in modern times and one need only read Judge Long- 
street’s inimitable account of “The Fight” in his “Georgia Scenes” to find a 
repetition of such a struggle, with not even gouging and biting barred. A 
cartoon in the Commercial Appeal of November 26th shows John Bull with 
a lion’s head in the attitude of a pancratiast throwing Egypt by taking the 
leghold. 
The Pentathlon was a combination of five events: running, jumping, throw- 
ing the discus, throwing the javelin, and wrestling. The jump, the discus
-P-A-G-E-205
ee, eee 
Secondary Schools of the Southern States 205 
and javelin throws, were peculiar to the Pentathlon and were regarded as 
typical of the whole competition. We find scenes from these contests fre- 
quently represented on Greek vases. There is a considerable doubt as to the 
exact order in which these events occur, and as to the method of deciding 
the victor. The order may well have varied in different ages and places, It 
seems likely that Olympia had a fixed order, and it is probable that the Olym- 
pian festival set the standard in this regard for the rest of Greece. Xenophon 
tells us that wrestling came last, and this seems natural. An epigram of 
Simonides gives the following order: jump, foot race, discus, javelin, wrest- 
ling. But it is evident that Simonides put the footrace second for metrical 
reasons. It seems likely that victory in any three of the contests gave the 
palm to the victor. The footrace was the short run, the distance being a 
stade, about 200 yards. 
The rules for these contests were carefully guarded, and any violation severely 
punished. The young athlete in the early morning, with his hand upon the 
body of the bleeding victim swore that he had duly qualified himself by ten 
months of continuous training in the gymnasium, and that he would use no 
fraud or guile in the sacred contests. Then the order came from the herald: 
“Let the runners put their feet to the line.” The herald then called on the 
spectators to challenge any not qualified by blood or character. Mardonius, 
the commander of the Persians, was astonished when he heard that these 
young athletes contested not for silver or gold, but for a simple wreath of 
olive, and that it was to bring honor to himself and to his city which inspired 
the youth in the contest. 
It was not until the middle of the 5th century B. C. that professionalism 
came in and brought a train of evils in its wake. The training became too 
scientific, and the athletes frequently trained for a single contest. They were 
allowed unusual privileges, but by the end of this century the name of athlete 
was no longer worn as a badge of honor. 
The lovely youths of Polycleitus, Pheidias, and Myron with their beautiful 
forms and intelligent faces have been the despair of subsequent sculptors. 
Compare with these the brutal figures of the boxer in the Terme Museum, dat- 
ing probably from the second century B. C., or the Farnese Hercules in the 
Naples Museum and see what havoc professionalism wrought. Socrates tells 
us that the runner of his time had overdeveloped legs, and that the upper 
part of the boxer’s body was overdeveloped. He held that the life led by the 
athletes in his day was incompatible with the cultivation of the soul. They 
obtained rich rewards and Aristophanes in his Plutus, the last of his plays, 
has Hermes deserting the gods and taking refuge with Plutus, the god of 
wealth, “the presider over contests.” Plato, howevr, knows of no life more 
blessed from a matrial point of view than that of an Olympian victor, and in 
the Myth of Ur, describes the soul of Atalanta, no mean athlete herself, as 
choosing the body of an athlete on seeing the great rewards which he obtained. 
“There is a point,” as Gardner observes, “in any sport or game where it be- 
comes overdeveloped and competition too severe for it to serve the true pur- 
pose of providing exercise or recreation for the many. It becomes the monopoly  
-P-A-G-E-206
  206 Proceedings of the Association of Colleges and 
of the few who can afford the time or money to acquire excellence, while the 
rest, despairing of any measure of success, prefer the role of spectators. When 
the rewards of success are sufficient there arises a professional class, and when 
professionalism is once established, the amateur can no longer compete with 
the professional.” Greece had approached this state by the end of the fifth 
century and athletics no longer exercised the wholesome influence which they 
had wielded for centuries. At the time of the Persian Wars the Greeks were a 
nation of athletes. When the Peloponnesian Wars began, this was no longer 
the case. Sparta, to a greater extent than any portion of Greece, cherished 
the old-fashioned ideas, and largely on this account she won in the struggle. 
The poet, Euripides, criticizes severely athletics as practiced in his age. He 
was well acquainted with the subject. Cellius tells us that his father, having 
consulted the Chaldeans with reference to his boy, was told that he would 
be a victor in the “contests.” The father understood this to mean that his 
son, should become an athlete, and he trained him with this end in view, and 
took the boy to Olympia in order that he might contend with boyish athletes. 
Cellius adds that he conquered in boxing at the Eleusinian and Thesean 
games and was crowned, but the poet in a fragment of a play which has been 
preserved pays his respects to the athletes of his time as follows: “Of all the 
countless evils throughout Hellas, there is none worse than the race of ath- 
letes. In youth, they strut about in splendor, the pride of their city, but when 
bitter old age comes upon them, they are cast aside like threadbare garments. 
I blame the custom of the Hellenes who gather together to watch these men, 
honoring a useless pleasure. Whoever helped his fatherland by winning a 
crown by wrestling, or for speed of foot, or hurling the discus, or striking 
a good blow on the jaw? Will they fight the foe with disci in their hands, 
or driving their fists through their foemen’s shields cast them out of the land? 
Crowns should be given to the good and wise, to him who guides the city 
best, a temperate man and just or who by his words drives away evil deeds, 
putting away war and faction.” 
In the earlier days corruption was rare at Olympia, and severely punished. 
In the 97th or 98th Olympiad the boys’ boxing match was won by Antipater 
of Miletus. Some emissaries of Dionysius had bribed the father to let his 
son be proclaimed a Syracusan, but the boy, better than his father, spurned 
the tyrant’s bribe and proclaimed himself a Milesian. Sotades of Crete, who 
won the long race at Olympia in the 99th Olympiad, accepted a bribe from the 
Ephesians and allowed himself to be proclaimed an Ephesian, giving truth 
to the words of a Greek prophet and poet—“The Cretans are always liars.” 
For this crime he was banished by his countrymen. We find from now on 
not only cases of false entries but the sale of victories, reminding us of some 
recent happenings in one of the major leagues. Eupolus of Thessaly in 388 
bribed his opponents in boxing to let him have the prize. The offense was dis- 
covered and Eupolus and those whom he had bribed were all heavily fined. 
In 332 Calippus, an Athenian, bribed his opponents in the Pentathlon. The 
decline continued steadily, though the enthusiasm for athletics survived with 
the masses. The training of the athlete became more and more artificial,
-P-A-G-E-207
  Secondary Schools of the Southern States 207 
rendering him unfit for the life of a useful citizen. Polybius relates an inci- 
dent which throws an interesting light upon the sport of the times. Cleito- 
machus had excited the displeasure of King Ptolemy, and he went to the ex- 
pense of training and sending to Olympia a rival boxer Aristonicus. The fickle 
crowd favored the new man until Cleitomachus taunted them for backing a 
man who was fighting not for the glory of Greece, but for King Ptolemy. 
This caused a revulsion of feeling, and the crowd now cheered Cleitomachus, 
and Polybius adds that Aristonicus was conquered not so much by his adver- 
sary as by the crowd. 
Efforts were made, however, to give systematic training in athletics to 
youths not preparing to go into athletic contests. This reminds us of the 
group athletics which we advocate today. In the third century a public 
spirited citizen of Teos presented the state with a considerable sum of money. 
He provided that the interest should be used to pay instructors for the youth 
of his own, and among them were included two instructors in athletics. It 
is interesting to note, however, that the highest paid teacher on the staff 
was not the instructor in athletics. 
In Greece, then, at first we find athletics generally practiced and unorgan- 
ized; then organized under strict rules and producing the fine fruits of cour- 
age, physical beauty, and patriotism, closely united with a love for literature 
and philosophy. Finally comes the descent into Avernus when professionalism 
had laid its blighting hand upon this fair flower leading to conditions set 
forth by Euripides, and the rest. We need not point the moral: “He who 
runs may read.” 
Roman ATHLETICS 
It is hardly necessary to remind you that the Romans and Greeks were 
kindred stocks, and brought with them into their respective lands a large 
store of common ideas and ideals, and from the earliest times had much in 
common both as to their family life and amusements. It is significant that 
the word for fist in Greek is akin to the Latin word pugnus, pointing to fistic 
contests at a period when the two people were one. There is little doubt 
that they brought with them many rustic sports and athletic contests. Vergil 
in the Georgics says “Mollibus in pratis unctos saluere per utres,” referring 
to a rustic sport of jumping on a goatskin or wine skin that was greased. 
This sport seems to have been common from early times to the Greeks and 
Romans. 
The Etruscans were close neighbors of the Romans, and influenced largely 
their life. Livy tells us that boxers were brought into Latium by Tarquin the 
Proud. We know that from this source the Romans got many of their relig- 
ious customs and laws, and that at a later time from them came the gladia- 
torial games. We are not left in doubt as to the Etruscan fondness for ath- 
letic sports, for numerous wall paintings from their tombs reveal to us their 
details. One of the best examples comes from the tomb of the Symposium 
at Tarquinii, the native city of Tarquin. Here we have represented athletes 
ready for the contest. On one wall are several two-horse chariots, not in the
-P-A-G-E-208
208 Proceedings of the Association of Colleges and 
act of racing, but making ready; on other walls we have racing on foot, leap- 
ing with poles, boxing with the cestus, hurling the discus, and wrestling. 
These same subjects are repeated in a number of tombs. Old Cato, though 
he hated the Greeks, in his old age taught his son Greek, for he felt that he 
had to know it, and trained him in the exercises of the gymnasium. Horace 
represents a well born Roman youth in love as turning away from hurling the 
javelin and discus, sports that were indulged in by manly Romans. Terence 
in the prologue to the Hecyra speaks of the popularity of boxing contests in his 
day, and says that he cannot hope to cope with them. In the “Miles Glori- 
osus,” the braggart captain is praised by his servant for his wonderful fist 
that crushes his enemies. But though we find that Romans early practiced: 
these athletic exercises, it was primarily to make them more efficient in war. 
The athlete was never looked upon as a hero who would shed honor on his 
city comparable to that of a victorious general. There were no festivals prior 
to the time of Augustus that compared with the four great festivals of Greece. 
They had their Ludi-Romani, Plebei, and consualia. But these were mostly 
contests in racing, theatrical contests, with some boxing, and later gladiatorial 
combats. Not until after the battle of Actium was there any public festival 
that could vie with the great festivals of Greece. And even then the con- 
testants were not of the best blood of Rome. We find that only once in this 
age did a man of consular rank contest as an athlete. The Romans had a 
contempt for the Greek athletes of their day, and even when these games were 
popularized at Rome, the contestants were mainly from the provinces. 
It would seem that the first important spectacle of this kind was exhibited at 
Rome by M. Fulvius Nobilior, and he imported athletes from Greece for this 
purpose. But this, though brilliant, was what might be called an “occasional 
contest.” Mommsen calls attention to the similarity between the Ludi Romani 
and the Olympian games, and ascribes it either to the common inheritance of 
the two peoples or contact with the Greeks. He shows that at first with the 
Romans the prize was a simple wreath, and that the emphasis was placed 
upon the honor and not the material reward, and further that it was for 
Roman burgesses free born, and that the Romans at first probably in their 
contests indulged in leaping and swinging, but that later their sports were 
degraded, and passed into the hands of freedmen, while the Romans looked 
on. We wait a hundred years after Nobilior until the time of Sulla, and find 
that he held athletic contests after his triumph over Mithradates, bringing 
athletes from all parts of the Greek world in such large numbers that at 
Olympia only foot-races could be held. Augustus, and no doubt his ministers 
Maecenas and Agrippa, became generous patrons of these contests. It was 
he who instituted the Actia as the fifth great festival of the Graeco-Roman 
world. Without doubt, athletic contests were a feature of the celebration. 
From this time on we find Rome running mad over athletics. The emperors 
were generous patrons of the spectacles, and nearly every new emperor added 
a new spectacle. These were connected with the names of Caligula and his 
successor Claudius who celebrated his victory over the Britons by chariot races 
and athletic contests. But Nero more than any who had gone before, popu-
-P-A-G-E-209
Secondary Schools of the Southern States 209 
larized these contests at Rome. He appeared in person as a contestant, and 
added new festivals, and made a round of the festivals in Greece, returning 
laden with crowns. He was received as a triumphator, and on his arrival a 
breach was made in the walls after the Greek fashion to receive him. But 
the Romans were still much opposed to these contests for themselves and 
their sons, though willing to look on. They thought it a shame for a free 
born Roman to bare his body in the arena to make a Roman holiday. The 
Greeks had not admitted women to these spectacles, but they were allowed 
to attend at Rome. We hear of Palfurius Sura, the son of a consular, ap- 
pearing as a wrestler, and even wrestling with a Spartan maiden. Races for 
girls were introduced, but the custom was frowned upon by the Romans. In 
86 Domitian established the Capitoline Agon, and these games seemed to have 
survived to the very end of antiquity. He built a stadium for athletes on the 
campus Martius that would probably hold 35,000 spectators. The emperor 
presided in a Greek purple mantle, wearing Greek shoes, and a diadem with 
images of the Capitoline triad on it. Hadrian was a generous patron of ath- 
letic sports, as one might suppose to be the case with Greekling. From early 
times boxing was popular with the Romans, at their village festivals, and 
their games; as with the Greeks were hallowed by the offices of religion. Even 
before the end of the republic Greek athltic exercises had become popular, 
and the antiquarian Varro says that at least one gymnasium was essential to 
every villa, The opposition continued, however, and the sequel showed that the 
opponents were right. They would not tolerate the girls’ race, and even after 
it was abolished kept up their opposition. In a council of Trajan, Junius 
Rusticus spoke for abolishing the Agon at Vienne, and he added: “I wish 
they were to cease here as well.” Pliny the younger was present and agreed, 
saying that it was worse to have it in Rome for the “disease is worse if it start 
from the head and extend.” This prejudice lasted well into the second cen- 
tury. In the time of Martial and Juvenal females followed athletics with all 
the enthusiasm that their modern sisters follow modern games of foot-ball and 
base-ball. But it must have had its good side, for Marcus Aurelius was a 
devotee of baxing, wrestling, and running. The great jurists Masurius Sabinus 
and Cassius Longinus decided that athletes did not follow the actor’s trade but 
demonstrated their bravery. “In other sports slaves frequently appeared, but 
when the victor was wreathed by the hand of the emperor at the imperial 
games, or the games of Greece, only freemen might compete.” There were 
many guilds of itinerant athletes who drifted from festival to festival, and 
the sports were practically all under professionals. There was nothing com- 
parable to the games of fine free youth in Greece of earlier days or the sports 
of the English colleges, and in some of our American institutions today. The 
evil influence seemed to have been greater than the good, for the bulk of 
enlightened opinion seems to have been cast into the scale against the 
athlete. Seneca says they were stupid, and compares their gluttony with that 
of horses. Plutarch, Epictetus, Galen, all speak unfavorably of the athlete. 
Galen says: “If Zeus should summon all animals to the agon in the Stadium 
as well as men, a man would never win: a hare would win in the simple

race, and in the double race a deer, in the long race, a horse, in fights in- 
volving strength, elephants and lions, in boxing, bulls, and asses, in the Pan- 
cratium, and the annals would record the victory of the Brayer over men in 
the 21st Olympiad.” 
This brief sketch of Roman athletics has served to show that among the 
Romans athletic vogue came shortly before the period of the decline, and 
though championed by some good men, the weight of the testimony was 
against rather than in favor of organized athletics, and the best Romans longed 
for the good old times when sports were unorganized and youth practiced 
athletic exercise only as a sport and not after the manner of professionals. 
It is believed we have in the experiences of these two great peoples examples 
that will be of much aid to us if we only take them to heart. 
  
Note:—In the preparation of this paper the writer reread numerous refer- 
ences to athletics in Greek and Roman writers, notably: Homer, Herodotus, 
Pindar, Theocritus, Euripides, Plautus, Terence, Livy, Horace, Vergil, Ovid, 
Cellius. He has further availed himself freely of the material contained in 
standard books dealing with the subject, and also the articles which have 
appeared from time to time in the classical journals. He would acknowledge 
in particular his indebtedness to: Greek and Roman Athletic Sports and 
Festivals, Fowler; Olympic Victor Monuments, Hyde; Roman Life and Man- 
ners Under the Early Empire, Friedlander; Die Spiele der Griechen und 
Romen, Richter; Daremberg et Saglio Dictionnaire des Antiquites grecques 
et romaines. 
The effort has been made to embrace in a single paper facts that are 
accessible to every student of the classics for the purpose of showing the value 
of athletics when properly sensed, and the dangers that inhere in profession- 
alism, and undue emphasis upon athletics. This is done with the hope that 
the implications involved may be helpful to many who like the writer believe 
strongly in the good inherent in athletics when duly controlled.

  Part VI 
REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON ATHLETICS 
This third report of the Committee on Athletics is presented in response to 
a resolution adopted at the Annual Meeting of this Association in 1923 
after the presentation of the second report. 
As a basis for this report a Questionnaire was sent out requesting informa- 
tion as to salaries of presidents, professors and athletic coaches. In an 
effort to avoid some of the alleged errors of the previous report, the 
comparative basis of presentation of data was abandoned. Each institution 
was requested to state the exact amount of the salaries of its respective 
officials. A copy of this questionnaire is submitted as a part of this report. 
In addition, a letter was addressed to the president of the institution ask- 
ing him to write the committee a full and frank statement of his views 
upon the intercollegiate athletic situation in the institutions constituting 
the membership. of this Association. Certain questions were asked in this 
letter, not with the idea that these particular questions necessarily repre- 
sented the principal phases of the athletic problem, but rather with the idea 
of opening the discussion thereby. 
The essential parts of this letter read as follows: 
The Committee on Athletic was further requested at the Rich- 
mond meeting to incorporate in its report some definite suggestions 
as to the elimination of some of the present evils and abuses in our 
system of intercollegiate athletics. 
It would be of very great assistance to the Committee if you would 
write us a frank statement of your own views on the problems of 
intercollegiate athletics. For instance: 
Do you really believe that your own institution is devoting too 
much time and attention to intercollegiate athletics? 
Do you think it proper that a first-class foot-ball coach should be 
paid a larger salary than the highest paid professor? There are 
many college men who defend this practice. 
Do you believe that the chief criterion for the selection of a coach 
should be his ability to produce a winning team? This appears to 
be the basis upon which the majority of our institutions select their 
coaches. 
Is the present system of handling athletics in our colleges of 
benefit to the whole student body, or only to a select few? 
(212)
-P-A-G-E-212
212 Proceedings of the Association of Colleges and 
If there are serious abuses in our present system, may they best 
be corrected by co-operative regulations, or by conscientious effort 
on the part of each institution individually and independently? 
The above questions are merely suggestions. Please give us the 
benefit of your ideas and thoughts upon this very important matter. 
We would suggest that a copy of this letter, as well as a copy of 
your answers to the questionnaire, be furnished your delegate to 
the annual meeting at Memphis. The men who go to this meeting 
are often not informed of the situation in their own institutions, 
The questionnaire was sent out to fifty-two institutions. Returns have 
been received from forty-nine of these; sixteen institutions failed to answer 
the general letter and two declined to give out information concerning the 
salaries of their presidents or professors. 
From the statistics as to salaries the following points may be of interest: 
The average salary of a president, taken from the returns of forty 
institutions was $7,606.00 in 1923-24, and $7,754.00 in 1924-25. 
These salaries range from $3,300.00 minimum to $15,000.00 maxi- 
mum in 1924-25, 
There are thirteen presidents whose salaries are $10,000.00 or 
over. 
The average of the maximum salaries paid to professors in 1923-24 
was $4,109.00, and in 1924-25, $4,142.00. These maximum salaries 
range from $2,300.00 minimum to $7,500.00 maximum. 
Eleven of these maximum salaries are $5,000.00 or over. 
The average of salaries of all foot-ball coaches in 1923-24 was 
$4,037.00, and in 1924-25, $4,466.00. These salaries range from 
$1,800.00 minimum to $10,000.00 maximum. 
Sixteen of these salaries are $5,000.00, or over. 
This comparison may be of interest: The average salary of the 
eleven highest paid professors in southern institutions is $5,810.00; 
the average salary of the eleven highest paid foot-ball coaches in 
southern institutions is $7,454.00, a difference of 28.3% in favor of 
the foot-ball coach. 
Total salaries in all departments of athletics and physical training 
in 1923-24 averaged $9,212.00, in 1924-25, $10,142.00. 
The detailed statistics from which the above averages were taken have 
been submitted in the form of a supplementary report to the Executive Com- 
mittee of the Association. 
Twenty-eight institutions express the belief that they are not de- 
voting too much time and attention to intercollegiate athletics. 
Four state quite frankly the contrary belief. 
Fifteen failed to answer this question. 
Ten colleges and universities consider it proper that a foot-ball 
coach should be paid more than the highest salaried professor in 
the institution. 
 
-P-A-G-E-213
  Secondary Schools of the Southern States 213 
Twenty-one believe that it should not be done. 
Sixteen returned no answer. 
Statistics show that 18 institutions pay their foot-ball coaches 
salaries which are actually greater than the salaries of the highest 
paid professor. Two of these salaries are higher than, and another 
equal to, that of the president of the institution. There are two 
part-time salaries which are considerably greater in proportion than 
those of the professors. 
Arguments in favor of this practice are ingenious on the one 
hand and ingenuous on the other. The fact still remains that in a 
number of institutions we pay the man who takes a small, specially 
selected group of men, and prepares them through the various de- 
vices of “coaching” to win certain contests, a salary of from 50% to 
150% greater than that paid the most distinguished teacher who, 
after long and expensive preparation, devotes his life to the task of 
training and developing all his students into power and intelligence. 
Is it right? 
Practically all institutions deny that the chief criterion for the 
selection of a coach should be his ability to produce winning teams. 
All admit, however, that this is a rather necessary criterion. 
Twelve institutions believe that the present system of intercol- 
legiate athletics is of benefit either directly or indirectly to the whole 
student body. 
Fifteen are of the opinion that the system operates for the bene- 
fit solely or principally of the select few who have the necessary 
athletic prowess to make the teams. 
Twenty returned no answer to this question. 
A majority of the institutions believe that existing abuses in inter- 
collegiate athletics can be eliminated only by co-operative effort 
and regulation. 
It is to be regretted that at least a dozen of the most prominent uni- 
versities in the Association failed to reply to the letter or to answer the 
questions referred to above. These institutions are prominent both in 
standards of scholarship and in the field of intercollegiate athletics. Ex- 
pressions of the views of their respective presidents upon the situation and 
its problems would have been of great assistance to your committee in the 
preparation of this report. 
A few brief quotations from letters received from college and universitiy 
presidents may not be out of place here: 
From a technical school: 
“The attitude of alumni and of the general public complicates the 
problem of the right perspective in athletics, but I believe that in 
time better, though perhaps never quite satisfactory, conditions will 
result.” 
From an endowed institution: 
   
-P-A-G-E-214
  214 Proceedings of the Association of Colleges and 
“I do not believe that a first-class football coach should be paid 
a larger salary than the highest paid professor. If the life of a foot- 
ball coach is shorter and more precarious, that fact should be 
changed.” 
From an endowed university: 
“I do not see why there should be the eternal question regarding 
the discrepancies between salaries of college professors and foot- 
ball coaches. Their lines of endeavor are entirely different. A foot- 
ball coach lives more in one season than a college professor does 
in ten.” 
(The above was written by the Director of Athletics, and not by 
President.) 
From a denominational university: 
“I do not believe that we will ever correct the present abuses un- 
til we have complete co-operation among all the institutions, and 
I am still more convinced that the whole athletic situation must be 
handled vigorously by the whole faculty of each institution rather 
than by a small athletic committee.” 
From a denominational college: 
“My point of view is that the Southern Association of Colleges 
should co-operate with the athletic associations of the south as an 
advisory body, giving these associations all the moral backing pos- 
sible. I doubt whether the Southern Association should become a 
regulating body in the matter of athletics further than regulating 
the standards of college work. 
From a state university: 
“T do not believe that our institution is devoting too much time 
and attention to intercollegiate athletics in view of the attention that 
is being paid not only to the intercollegiate athletics but to athletics 
of all kinds by the people of our country.” 
“There is no necessary relationship between the salary of a coach 
and that of a professor. The law of supply and demand operates 
to some extent in this as in other matters. First class coaches and 
athletics directors seem to be scarcer than first class professors, and 
only first class men and women should be employed in either capacity 
by a college that can afford to pay for the best service.” 
From a denominational college: 
“I would like to repeat to you the suggestion which I made last 
year, that in my opinion the benefits of the one-year rule which has 
recently been adopted by both of the Southern Associations are 
largely neutralized by the formation of intercollegiate freshman 
schedules and that the abolition of all freshman intercollegiate 
games would do very much to put athletics on the right basis. /f 
this proves to be inadequate I would have no hesitation in taking the 
  the
-P-A-G-E-215
Secondary Schools of the Southern States 
next logical step of making second year men ineligible for the 
teams.” 
From a denominational college: 
“We are not getting anywhere by this vicious circle of demand- 
ing winning teams and using money to get them. All cannot win, 
therefore, we are at exactly the same point as if we spent thousands 
of dollars or none at all. Under no circumstances do I think a 
coach should receive more than a professor. 
A winning team should not be the goal at all, but the greatest 
benefit to the greatest number of students should be our desire. I 
am frank to say we are not getting that in ........ College. We, 
like others, are pampering the football men for a winning team and 
neglecting our other men. This is over my protest, but we are 
improving constantly. Our ambition outruns common sense. For 
example, why should little ........ College have an ambition to 
play and even defeat ........ University?”   
From an endowed college: 
“It would seem that it is a degradation of a college to pay a 
‘coach’ more than is paid the president or the highest paid pro- 
fessors. If it is not saying that the ‘coach’ is more valuable than 
the president, what is it saying to the students? If, however, I 
could find a man who could train my students to beat........ Col- 
lege and ... two out of every three games, I should be glad 
to give him twice my salary, if I had it. Not because I think he is 
twice as valuable as I am but because he would certainly give more 
genuine pleasure and satisfaction, as things go now, to everybody I 
believe who has an interest in ........ ; except, perhaps, some of 
the mothers of the boys. But 90% of the trustees, alumni and 
friends of the institution would be kept in such good humor that 
few would find fault with anything that was done at the college. 
‘I speak as a fool’, as St. Paul says, but that’s the way to speak 
when you are talking about athletics.” 
  From an endowed institution: 
“T have always been active in the affairs of this Conference since 
its foundation. I am convinced that gradually there have been 
evolved certain cooperative regulations which have been helpful, but 
I am equally convinced that the only real method of correcting 
serious abuse lies in the individual institution and in the faculty 
committees of such institutions. The control of athletics by the 
faculty is imperative, and from that stage on the individual institu- 
tion can best and will best correct any abuse.” 
From a denominational university: 
“It is a great temptation to denominational colleges, which are 
uniformly poor and which are trying to compete with better known 
and better financed institutions, to promise more than they can per- 
Nn 
  
uw
-P-A-G-E-216
  16 Proceedings of the Association of Colleges and 
form and to endeavor to surpass larger institutions on the athletic 
field. It is especially unfortunate that denominational colleges 
should be among the worst sinners in the matter of commercialized 
athletics.” 
From an endowed college: 
“I think that the present system of handling athletics in our col- 
leges is largely for the benefit of the select few ratehr than of the 
whole student body. I believe that abuses in our present system may 
be corrected both by co-operative regulations and by the conscien- 
tious efforts of each institution. I believe we need co-operative 
regulations for the initiation and promulgation of commonly intel- 
ligible ideals and terms of sportsmanship and the eligibility of players, 
and we need the backing of a large number of colleges to aid in the 
enforcement of regulations; but all the associations and all the 
regulations in the world will never insure clean athletics in a 
college where the faculty and students do not concientiously desire 
clean athletics and work for them.” 
From a denominational college: 
“No merely theoretical discussion of the place or the abuses of 
college athletics will profit much. College sports must be considered 
in the light of the place they have gained in the colleges today. The big 
task is to make athletics an organic part of collegiate training and 
to use wisely for our youth the good that undoubtedly is to be 
obtained from such sports. This we certainly cannot do either by 
outlawing athletics or by leaving them to the control of irresponsible 
persons. The oldest and most looked up to institutions of learn- 
ing in our land set their approval on athletics at heavy financial 
costs and have done so for years. Evidently this must count as 
strong argument for college athletics. Wisely and honestly directed 
colleges with no dependence on popular approval for their existence 
must be given credit for endeavoring to solve the ever arising 
problems wisely and honestly. Their example in the long run will 
probably be the best means of creating a correct public opinion 
regarding college athletics, and this educated opinion will do much 
to correct the abuses in other colleges.” 
From an endowed university: 
“For the reasons that I have outlined very fully it seems to me 
that such figures as you gave last year fail to prove anything.” (The 
words “such figures”, refer to some of the statistics in last year’s 
report which compared the monthly salaries of part time foot-ball 
coaches with the monthly salaries of presidents and professors.) “I 
do not believe a fair criticism of athletic administration can be 
based in such things alone. My final reflection is that athletic 
services should be paid according to their real value in the life of 
the institution, and not according to an artificial standard made by
-P-A-G-E-217
Secondary Schools of the Southern States 
the public who wish to see always a winning team. I am further 
of the opinion that athletic officers ought in the main to be full time 
workers, and that there should not be any wide discrepancy between 
salaries paid them and salaries paid other workers, but I am also 
of the opinion that special men have to be employed sometimes for 
special services and for part time. In these cases I think a some- 
what varying standard has to be adopted. I am here in favor of 
publicity and frankness.” 
From an endowed university: 
“I do not see that too much time is being spent on intercollegiate 
athletics at ......... My own feeling in the matter is that boys 
in college get an inspiration from intercollegiate competition that 
develops into one of the brightest spots in their lives and remains 
with them always.” 
From a technical institution: 
“The chief weakness of college athletics, in my estimation, is 
that the system almost universally found benefits a comparatively 
small proportion of the student body. We have, during the last three 
years at this institution sought to include a majority of the students 
thru mass athletics, the development of class teams, military com- 
pany teams, etc., with intramural contests; and I believe valuable 
results are being secured in this way. But of course this does not 
apply to intercollegiate athletics, except perhaps that the Fresh- 
man intercollegiate contests serve to bring in a somewhat larger 
number than formerly. 
“To my mind the greatest evil of athletics is the attitude of the 
alumni and others on the outside who look upon the intercollegiate 
contests as commercial enterprises, or still worse as opportunities for 
gambling. I often feel that we have gotten away from the real 
sport motive, and that it is difficult to justify our intercollegiate con- 
tests on the ground of recreation and physical development. The 
‘scouting’ for athletics on the part of alumni ond others is obviously 
an outcome of this attitude.” 
From an endowed college: 
“Your question in regard to the criterion for the selection of a 
coach is a hard one to answer. We do not believe that a coach 
should be expected solely to produce a winning team, but, knowing 
human nature as I do, and this includes the human nature of the 
faculty as well as in students and alumni, my judgment is that he 
must be able to produce first class teams that do their share of win- 
ning if he is able to keep his place. 
“I think there can be no doubt that our present system of hand- 
ling athletics in most colleges is not for the benefit of the whole 
student body, but chiefly for the benefit of the select few. We 
are all going to have to reform this situation—that is, do some- 
  27.
-P-A-G-E-218
  218 Proceedings of the Association of Colleges and 
thing more than we have been doing for the whole student body 
without neglectingg the select few.” 
Your Committee would recommend that this Association exert its in- 
fluence and authority in the most active and positive way toward the 
curtailment of the activities of the preparatory and high schools in the 
matter of inter-scholastic football. The present system of intensive train- 
ing and coaching should be stopped and the schedules be limited to a 
small number of contests with schools in the immediately contiguous territory. 
The emphasis should be placed upon the teaching of physical training and 
the development of a spirit of spontaneous play, not upon coaching to win 
specific games. 
Your Committee believes that every institution which is a member of 
this Association and which engages in intercollegiate contests should be 
required to become a member of some well recognized athletic conference 
which enforces the Freshman rule. Even this rule, however, is being 
abused. One of the strongest arguments advanced in favor of the adoption 
of the rule was that it would serve to keep the young student just entering 
college out of the strenuous activities of intercollegiate athletics until he 
had time to adjust himself to the new conditions of university or college 
life. This benefit, however, is in fair way of being nullified by the present 
practice in the organization and development of Freshman teams. Fresh- 
men are now having their own intercollegiate contests on about as extensive a 
scale as that of the regular varsity team. This is a phrase of the problem 
which calls for the same sort of vigorous treatment as that recommended 
for the high schools. 
Your Committee is of the opinion that in many colleges and universities 
the alumni still exert too great a measure of control over the athletic 
policies in the institution. In too many cases we deceive ourselves with the 
belief that we have faculty control, when as a matter of fact the alumni 
actually dominate the situation. It behooves every institution in this 
Association to examine its own records in this regard and to determine 
whether it has the type of control in which final decision in all matters of 
athletic policy rests absolutely and unequivocally with the faculty. How 
many members of the faculty in your particular institution know anything, 
or care anything about the athletic policies of the college? Is it not a 
fact that the director of athletics, the head coach, and certain influential 
alumni and friends of the college are the sole arbiters of your athletic 
policy? 
The 1923 Report of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancment of 
Teaching in a briet comment upon the first report of your Committee on 
Athletics, makes this pertinent statement: 
“The story of the influence of alumni associations in the athletic 
interests of their colleges raises some question as to how far alumni 
representation on the board of trustees has been helpful toward sound 
educational progress. So far as the evidences go, alumni trustees
-P-A-G-E-219
  Secondary Schools of the Southern States 219 
the country over have thrown the weight of their influence toward a 
policy of exploitation of athletics rather than toward an increase in 
the scholarly fruitfulness of their institutions. In any event, it would 
seem apparent from the history of the past twenty years that those 
alumni who have gained position and influence with their colleges 
have been chiefly from the number of those whose interests lay in 
athletic competition rather than in scholarly development. There 
are, of course exceptions to this state of affairs, and notable excep- 
tions. Nevertheless, so far as the general influence of alumni upon 
their institutions has been made manifest, it may fairly be said that 
alumni influence has been exerted rather in the exploitation side of 
their universities than in the development of their steady and serious 
work.” 
For this Association to concern itself further wih the minor abuses in 
intercollegiate athletics, in the opinion of your Committee, would be thresh- 
ing over old straw and a waste of time. These have been brought to your 
attention in great detail in two previous reports. 
These minor abuses are smiply phases of the great outstanding evil con- 
nected with modern intercollegiate football, and that is the intense spirit of 
commercialism which pervades the whole system. 
This is the general comment of the Carnegie Foundation upon the first 
report presented by your Committee on Athletics: 
“The report of this committee with respect to the status of college 
athletics in the Southern States cannot but raise some apprehension 
in the minds of reflecting men. The abuses of intercollegiate 
athletics in southern colleges are certainly no greater than in other 
parts of the country, but it is quite clear, from this report and from 
similar inquiries, that the conduct of intercollegiate athletics has 
brought upon educational institutions in general very definite weak- 
ness, whatever positive value may have come from them. Apart from 
the evils of commercialism, extravagence, the temptation to gambling, 
and other similar by-products, the exploition of intercollegiate 
athletics has distorted the perspective of the college life. In the eyes 
of the student body success in such contests far outweighs that of 
scholarly work and the old-time academic virtues of simplicity, sin- 
cerity, and faihtfulness to study. This situation has come about as 
the result of many contributing factors—the universal tendency of 
American people to excessive expenditures, the exploitation of 
athletics by the daily papers, the lack of keen interest in the re- 
wards of scholarship, and the propaganda carried on by the athletic 
organizations. The most disturbing feature of this whole situation 
lies in the fact that the college governing boards, and sometimes the 
faculties, seem to have abandoned, without any sufficient effort, the 
attempt to keep organized athletics within a field where such con-

the bad features of the existing situation, those who have to do with 
the government and conduct of the colleges are primarily responsible. 
Many college trustees, and a large proportion of college professors, 
are keenly alive to this responsibility, The unwise competition that 
has gone on between American colleges has hitherto exercised so 
powerful an influence in favor of the exploitation of intercollegiate 
athletics that neither the trustees nor the faculties have had the 
courage to resist it.” 
The spirit of commercialism has developed so rapidly in the last few years 
that it is fast getting out of bounds. Is it something that should be en- 
couraged and fostered in our institutions of learning, or is it something 
whose growth should be held in check? 
If we believe the former then we should stop talking about intercollegiate 
athletics and let it go its way; if we believe the latter, then it is high time 
that some definite checks be placed upon the future development of the 
system. 
To this latter end your Committee on Athletics would recommend that 
the Executive Committee of this Association proceed at once to get into 
touch with the executive committee of the standard athletic conferences 
such as the Southern, the S. I. A. A., the Southwestern, etc., with the 
purpose of trying to find a solution of the problem through active and con- 
scientious co-operation. 
We would further recommend that your Association consider the advis- 
ability and the practicability of holding in the near future a conference of 
the presidents of institutions for the specific purpose of considering the 
problem of intercollegiate athletics. 
Respectfully submitted,

222 Proceedings of the Association of Colleges and 
REPORT OF THE FRATERNAL DELEGATE TO THE NORTH 
CENTRAL ASSOCIATION 
JosepH RoEMER 
Professor of Secondary Education and High School Visitor) University of 
Florida and Secretary of the Commission on Secondary Schools 
The exchange of fraternal delegates has been a custom long used by the 
Southern and North Central Associations, the purpose being that of con- 
veying the good will of the respective associations and bringing back such 
helps as will advance the cause of education in each territory. It was the 
privilege of the writer to be the fraternal delegate of the Southern Asso- 
ciation to the North Central Association at its Chicago meeting in March. 
It is the purpose of this article to give some impressions and make some 
suggestions for the consideration of the members of the Southern Association. 
Before doing so the writer wishes to express his profound gratitude to the 
North Central Association for the very gracious treatment accorded him which 
enabled him to see the intimate workings of the association and get the most 
possible from the meeting. 
No one can see the two associations at work without being impressed with 
the great similarity of the problems with which the two associations are 
confronted. For the sake of clarity a few of the problems will be discussed 
which have some bearing upon the work of the Southern Association and 
suggestions made as to how we may profit by them. 
1. The North Central Association requires that one hundred per cent of 
the teachers of academic subjects in the secondary schools accredited by the 
association shall be graduates of standard colleges. It is a reasonable stand- 
ard and one they live up to. In the Southern Association we require seventy- 
five per cent of the teachers to be graduates of standard colleges. The 
manifest weakness in our scheme is that the other twenty-five per cent may 
be very poorly trained and still meet required standards. With the increas- 
ing number of stand-rd institutions of higher learning, the increasing ease with 
which a college education may be had, and the increasing demands for well 
trained teachers the time has come when the Southern Association should 
consider raising its standard to one hundred per cent. 
23 “Again all teachers of academic subjects in the North Central Associa- 
tion must have a minimum of eleven hours of professional training. All new 
teachers after another year must have fifteen hours. Here, again, the reason- 
ableness of the standard is evident. There is no reason why the Southern 
Association should not move up from the position of “recommending” pro- 
fessional training to that of “requiring” it. Some of the secondary school 
men of the North Central Association suggested that this standard of pro- 
fessional training should apply to the college teachers also, which is not a 
bad suggestion. Part I of the Proceedings of the North Central Association 
for this year carries Principal M. H. Stuart’s report on the “Ballot for the 
Referendum Vote” on the question of raising the professional requirements 
of all high school teachers of their association, handling the academic sub-
-P-A-G-E-223
    
Secondary Schools of the Southern States 223 
jects, from eleven to fifteen hours. This report shows clearly where they 
stand on this matter. The vote is about three to one in favor of raising the 
requirement to fifteen hours. 
3. In addition to the two commissions, one on higher institutions and one 
on secondary schools, which we have in the Southern Association, the North 
Central Association has a third commission called the “Commission on Unit 
Courses and Curricula.” As the title indicates, the work of the commission is 
to carry on studies and investigations having to do with the various phases 
of the curricula. These are some standing committees on the various subjects 
in the Southern Association but they actually do very little. It seems to the 
writer that this phase of our work could be very materially improved by creat- 
ing in the Southern Association a third commission similar to the one of 
the North Central Association. 
4. As Secretary of the Commission on Accredited Schools of the Southern 
Association, the writer has felt all along that too little time and attention 
is given by the association to the report of this commission. At the last 
meeting, for example, less than one-half hour was consumed in hearing and 
disposing of the report of the commission which has the oversight of the 
706 secondary schools of the association. The North Central Association 
devotes one whole half-day session to the report of the commission. At their 
last meeting, after carefully considering the routine report of the commission, 
considerable time was devoted to hearing reports of investigations and special 
studies carried on during the year by the commission. In fact the three 
sessions held by the association were devoted to the reports of the three 
commissions; each commission being allotted one full session in which to 
present and discuss its year’s work. The writer believes there is a suggestion 
in this practice for us of the Southern Association. 
5. It is interesting to note that at the last meetings of both associations 
regulations were adopted requiring all principals and supervisory officers of 
the accredited secondary schools to meet all the standards set up for the 
teachers. This is decidedly an advance step. 
6. One of the problems selected for investigation by the “Special Studies 
Committee” for next year in the North Central Association is the “pupil 
load.” At their recent meeting they passed this regulation, “Four unit 
courses or the equivalent as defined in standard four shall be considered the 
normal amount of work to be carried for credit by the average or medium 
student. Only these students who have made passing grades in each subject 
studied during the preceding term, and who ranked in the upper twenty-five 
per cent of their classes, may be allowed to take more than four units for 
credit.” It will be the purpose of this study to ascertain (1) what per cent 
of pupils carry a fifth study, (2) what per cent carry a sixth study, (3) on 
what basis additional subjects are allowed, (4) What the effect the additional 
subjects is upon the grade of work done, etc. This study is fraught with 
great possibilities for good as this is one of the most important unsolved 
problems in secondary education. They have asked the Southern Association 
   
-P-A-G-E-224
  224 Proceedings of the Association of Colleges and 
to collaborate with them in carrying on simultaneously a similar study in 
our association. It is hoped this proposition will receive careful attention. 
7. The other problem set by this Special Studies Committee of the North 
Central Association is the compiling a Deans’ Report similar to the one 
the Southern Association has been issuing for some years. The way in which 
our report was received and the many favorable things said about it were a 
great source of pleasure to the writer. 
8. Another problem confronting both the associations is the question of 
standardizing commercial schools. The North Central Association has had a 
special committee at work on this matter for some time. At the last meeting 
this committee submitted a report which was warmly discussed pro and con. 
At the conclusion of the discussion the report was received and held over 
for a year without action. The writer believes that here, too, this problem 
is of enough importance to the Southern Association to justify a careful 
study being made of it. 
9. It is very gratifying to see the fine way in which the North Central 
Association has developed its section having to do with teacher training 
institutions. There are great hopes for this phase of the work which our 
Southern Association is just getting under way, The rapid development of 
the teacher training institutions in the South makes this an important phase 
of higher education and one worthy of our careful consideration. 
10. Without comment let me say it is gratifying to see the way the North 
Central Association is working on the Junior College situation. The Junior 
College has come to stay, and the movement is far enough along in the South 
to justify the Southern Association in turning its attention to it. 
1l. In the last place the stzndardization of the Junior High School proved 
a most interesting discussion. One group wanted the “hands-off” policy for 
the Junior High School, contending that it was still in the experimental stage 
and that standardization would retard or stifle further development. This 
group felt that the situation should be left open for study, experimentation, 
investigation, etc., without the cramping influence of having to abide by certain 
fixed standards and regulations. In order to allow for the fullest and freest 
development they demanded that the institutions of higher learning standardize 
only the Senior High School of grades ten, eleven and twelve on a twelve- 
unit basis. This, they contended, would safeguard the interests of the higher 
institutions, guaranteeing the fullest opportunity for the development of the 
Junior High School without lowering standards in any way whatsoever. Of 
course the other group felt standards should be evolved and applied to the 
Junior High School as to the Senior High School. Upon the final solution 
of this matter depends largely the future development of the Junior High 
School in the North Central territory. As a final suggestion may the writer 
say that it is exceedingly important that the Southren Association also should 
begin a careful study of the Junior High School movement in it s own territory.

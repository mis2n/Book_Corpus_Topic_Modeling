  REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, 
Bureau or Epucation, 
Washington, March 29, 1912. 
Sir: The Annual Reports of the Commissioner of Education show a 
constant and rapid increase from year to year in the number and size 
of schools of all grades, in the value of property used for educational 
purposes, and in the current expenditures for the support of schools, 
libraries, and other educational institutions. The summary survey 
of the progress of education in this country in the first decade of the 
present century, made by Dr. Fletcher B. Dresslar, of this bureau, 
and published in this the first volume of the Report of the Commis- 
sioner of Education for the year ended June 30, 1911, shows a most 
remarkable advance. Never have the people shown more clearly 
their interest and faith in education and in schools of all kinds and 
grades. Within the decade the average length of the public-school 
term in the country as a whole increased 12 days, or 8$ per cent. 
The average number of days attended by each child enrolled in the 
public schools increased 13.6 days, or a little more than 13.7 per cent. 
The number of teachers in the public schools increased nearly 20 per 
cent. The average monthly salary for male teachers increased about 
35 per cent; for female teachers about 25 per cent. Because of the 
increase in the length of the school term this makes the increase in the 
average annual salary of male teachers about 88 per cent and of 
female teachers about 27 per cent. The value of all public-school 
property increased more than 75 per cent, the income of public-schools 
more than 83 per cent. The number of children in public kinder- 
gartens increased more than 40 per cent. The number of public high 
schools in the country increased more than 70 per cent; the number 
of public high-school pupils more than 76 per cent. The appropria- 
tions of public funds for normal schools for the education and pro- 
fessional training of teachers increased 140 per cent. The number 
of students in professional courses in public normal schools increased 
68 per cent. The productive endowments of universities, colleges, 
and schools of technology increased 65 per cent. The incomes of such 
institutions, exclusive of additions to endowments, increased 173 
per cent. Professors and instructors increased 61 per cent and the 
number of students 67 per cent. The standards of high schools and 
colleges have been raised perceptibly. Attendance laws have been 
x1

  extended, made more effective, and better enforced than formerly. 
Much has been done in adapting the work of the schools to the needs 
of life, modifying courses of study, and introducing new subjects, 
principally vocational subjects. Public libraries have been opened 
in many cities not formerly having them, and some progress has been 
made in making books accessible to people in the open country and 
away from the centers of population. Within the decade there has 
been much improvement in school administration, both in city and in 
country, and a tendency toward a closer and more effective organiza- 
tion of the school systems of the several States has grown rapidly. 
Several great foundations for the advancement of education, such as 
the General Education Board, the Carnegie -Foundation for the 
Advancement of Teaching, the Russell Sage Foundation, etc., have 
been established by private individuals. Churches, philanthropic 
societies, and private individuals have shown increased interest. in 
education, and the number of private and parochial schools has 
grown steadily. Within the decade the percentage of illiteracy for 
all classes of people of the United States has decreased from 10.7 per 
cent to 7.7 per cent; for native whites from 4.6 per cent to 3 per cent; 
for colored people from 44.5 per cent to 30.5 per cent. 
The progress in those States in which for many reasons there had 
been less development before the beginning of the decade has been still 
more remarkable than that indicated by the progress for the country 
as a whole. 
Everywhere the importance and necessity of education for civic, 
economic, social, and spiritual welfare are recognized more than ever 
before. In few communities does there exist any longer much 
antagonism in the minds of the people between the elementary and 
the higher schools. Much less often than formerly does one hear it 
asserted that the State’s duty in regard to education ends with the 
establishment and maintenance of elementary and grammar schools. 
More and more all education is regarded as a unit. 
This progress in interest, equipment, adaptation, and appreciation 
is very gratifying, but it serves chiefly to call attention to the vast 
amount yet to be done before we shall have begun to attain anything 
like the ideal of education necessary in our civic, industrial, and 
social democracy. The individual and social welfare alike demand 
the highest and best possible education for every individual, and a 
constant readjustment of ideals ‘and methods to the everchanging 
requirements of our developing institutions. 
According to the Federal Census of 1910, there were in the United 
States at the time this census was taken 5,517,608 persons 10 years 
of age and over unable to read and write. Of these, 1,535,530 were 
native whites, 1,650,519 foreign whites, and 2,331,559 colored. A 
very much larger number could barely read and write.

THE COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION. xmr 
  Of twenty-five million children of school age (5 to 18), less than 
twenty million are enrolled in schools of all kinds and grades, publie 
and private, and the average daily attendance does not exceed 
fourteen million, for an average school term of less than 8 months of 
20 days each. The average daily attendance of those enrolled in the 
public schools is only 113 days in the year, less than 5} months. The 
average attendance of the entire school population is only 804 days, 
or 4 months of 20 days each. Assuming that this rate of attendance 
shall continue through the 13 school years (5 to 18), the average amount 
of schooling received by each child of the school population will be 
1,046 days, or a little more than 5 years of 10 school months. This 
bureau has no reliable statistics on the subject, but it is quite probable 
that less than half the children of the country finish well more than 
the first 6 grades, only about one-fourth of the children ever enter 
high school, and less than 8 in every 100 do the full 4 years of high- 
school work. Fewer than 5 in 100 receive any education above the 
high school. ; 
But a knowledge of averages alone is not sufficient for a clear under- 
standing of what is being done for the education of our future citizens. 
One needs to know what is done in the several States and for indi- 
viduals. In 10 States less than two-thirds of the school population 
are enrolled; in 17 States less than two-thirds of those enrolled are 
in average daily attendance. In 26 States the average length of a 
school term is less than 160 days, or 8 months. In several States 
it is little more than 100 days. “In 42 States the average attend- 
ance of the children of school age is less than 100 days; in 19 
States less than 75 days; in 5 States less than 50 days. In no 
State is it more than 114 days. Of children enrolled the average 
daily attendance is less than 100 days in 19 States and less than 
75 days in 5 States. The expenditure for public education is less 
than $5 per capita in 25 States and less than $2.50 per capita in 10 
States. In 10 States the expenditure per capita of average attendance 
is less than $15; in 2 States it is less than $8. The average for all 
of the Southern States is barely $14. In 11 States the average 
annual salary of teachers is less than $400; in 8 it is less than $300; 
in 2 less than $250. For salaries like these it is clearly impossible to 
hire the services of men and women of good native ability and suffi- 
cient scholarship, training, and experience to enable them to do 
satisfactory work. The average annual salary for public-school 
teachers, including teachers in the wealthy cities and in the high 
schools, is less than $500, about $3 a day for the actual number of 
days taught, and about $1.60 per day for the working days of the year. 
It should be remembered that teachers are expected to give their 
entire time either to the actual work in the schoolroom, to school 
work which must be done out of school hours, or to preparing them- 
   
-P-A-G-E-14

selves, in summer schools and elsewhere, for better service. Clearly 
there must be a large increase in the salaries of teachers before we 
may expect the efficient service which is desirable. 
At last all of the States have normal schools of some kind for 
the professional training of teachers, but in the country at large 
less than one-half the teachers have had adequate preparation for 
their work. In some States less than 25 per cent of the teachers 
have had the full preparation given by the normal schools and in 
most of the States less than 10 per cent of the teachers in the country 
schools have had such preparation. If there is a reason why one 
teacher should have adequate training, that the time, money, and 
opportunity of the children of our schools may be well used, there is 
an equal reason why every teacher should be adequately trained, that 
the time, money, and opportunity of all children in all schools may 
be well used. A very large per cent of the teachers are young men 
and women under 21 years of age. Few continue to teach long 
enough to gain wisdom and skill from experience. In several States 
from 20 to 30 per cent of the teachers every year are-beginners. In 
a few States the average length of service of teachers is less than 4 
years of 6 months each, 
Schoolhouses and equipment are still inadequate. The total value 
of all school property, including houses, grounds, and equipment, is 
less that $40 for each child of school age. 
The country schools are particularly unsatisfactory. In many 
instances houses are cheap, insanitary, uncomfortable, and unattrac- 
tive. The terms are short, the teachers poorly prepared, poorly paid, 
and overworked. In thousands of schools one teacher teaches from 
20 to 30 classes a day, for many of which the class period is less than 
10 minutes. Courses of study are ill-adapted to the interests of 
country children or the needs of country life. Attendance is irregular, 
and many children quit school forever before they have learned to 
read easily and readily ordinary English or.to do the problems in 
arithmetic and concrete geometry arising in the daily life on the farm. 
Few learn enough of the history of their country and its institutions 
to fit them for intelligent citizenship, and fewer still have any ade- 
quate introduction to the great stores of literature or form the habit 
of reading good books so desirable in a country whose institutions 
are founded on the idea of the intelligence and self-directing power of 
the individual. Despite the investment of many millions of dollars 
in public libraries within the last few years, more than half the people 
of the country and nearly all the people living in small villages and 
rural communities are still without access to any large supply of well- 
selected books. 
In mining districts and manufacturing towns and cities large num- 
bers of children quit school and go into the mines and mills before

THE COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION. xV 
they reach the years of adolescence, when they can first begin to 
learn the most important facts and principles of citizenship and adult 
life, and before their physical strength and powers of endurance are 
sufficient to enable them to work at their tasks without permanent 
injury. 
In the schools of city and country alike the great problem of moral 
education is yet to be solved. Knowledge is power. That this 
power may be used for the public welfare, it must be directed by a . 
right understanding of human relations, by strong purpose, and good. 
will. Right moral education must come to be understood as an 
essential part of the function of public and private schools alike. 
Much remains to be done in higher education also. Of the four or 
five millions of young men and women of college age in the country, 
only about 200,000, or about 5 per cent, are doing college work in 
standard institutions. Less than 2 per cent do the full four years’ 
work and take a degree. The best interests of the civic and indus- 
trial life of the country demand that a larger per cent of its citizens 
should have the preparation for leadership and direction of affairs 
which the colleges are supposed to give. 
In 1910, 602 institutions conferring degrees reported to this bureau. 
Of this number, 550 reported their total receipts. The total receipts 
of 341 were less than $100,000; of 275 the total receipts were léss than 
$50,000; of 91 the total receipts were less than $25,000; of 47 the 
total receipts were less than $10,000. Practically all of these were 
attempting to do four years of college work, and many of them, 
especially those having the smaller incomes, were attempting to do 
preparatory work in addition. The equipment of these institutions 
varies as widely as their income. Plainly, a degree conferred by one 
of these institutions does not mean and can not mean the same as 
that conferred by another. Much would be gained, I believe, for the 
country and for the institutions themselves if most of those having an 
income of less than $50,000 and all of those having incomes less than 
$25,000 would reorganize their work and not attempt to give the full 
four years of college work. It would be a great gain for them to 
become junior colleges, devoting all their energies to two or three 
years of work and sending their students for the last one or two years 
of their undergraduate work to those institutions having larger 
incomes and better equipment in laboratories, library, and faculty. 
In the improvement of schools and other means of education the 
United States Bureau of Education should be an important factor. 
This bureau has no direct control over the schools or other educational 
agencies in any State, nor should it have. This control should, I 
think, remain forever in the States. The service of the bureau must 
be in other ways, and these ways aremany. Every year the demands 
made upon it by State and city school officers, by teachers in schools 
13144°—rp 1911—vo1 1——-1 
 
-P-A-G-E-16
  XVI EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
of all grades and kinds, and by other citizens interested in education 
become more numerous and more insistent. The opportunities for” 
valuable service which either can not be rendered at all or can not 
be rendered as well by other agencies are almost unlimited, but most 
of these must be allowed to pass by because of lack of men and women 
in the bureau with the education, training, and experience necessary 
to equip them to do the kind of work needed, and for lack of sufficient 
appropriations to employ such men and women and to pay their 
necessary traveling expenses. 
I think it not inappropriate to reproduee here that portion of the 
Annual Statement of the Commissioner of Education to the Secretary 
of the Interior for the year ended June 30, 1911, embodying the recom- 
mendations for the immediate extension and improvement of the 
work of the bureau. Many things not enumerated in these recom- 
mendations must be provided for before the bureau can begin to.do 
in an effective way a large part of the work which properly belongs 
to it. These include the study of the education of abnormal and 
defective children—the deaf, the blind, feeble-minded children, chil- 
dren of criminal tendencies, the care and education of orphans— 
professional education, and the education of the more or less primitive 
races in the foreign possessions of the United States. 
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE IMMEDIATE EXTENSION AND IMPROVE- 
MENT OF THE WORK OF THE BUREAU OF EDUCATION. 
[From the Annual Statement of the Commissioner of Education te the Secretary of the Interior.] 
It is very important that all statistical reports of this bureau be issued within a 
short time after the date or period for which the information is collected, and these 
reports should be accurate and exhaustive for the subjects covered. Under the present 
plan of collecting statistics neither of these ends is attainable, since for all statistical 
data the bureau must, for promptness, accuracy, and thoroughness, depend alone 
on the good will and interest of many thousands of school officers of various grades in 
all parts of the country, without having authority to enforce compliance with any 
request of the commissioner, and without funds with which to remunerate anyone for 
filling the blanks of the schedules prepared and sent out by the bureau or for furnish- 
ing any other information. Iam undertaking to arrange with the chief school officers 
of the several States a plan by which this bureau and the State departments of educa- 
tion may cooperate to secure promptly complete and reliable statistics in all educa- 
tional agencies and activities, this bureau assisting State officers in the collection and 
preparation of material and receiving in return from them all or most of the data 
needed for its use. From all of these school officers with whom I have had an oppor- 
tunity to confer I have assurance of the heartiest cooperation. If the plan proposed 
can be carried out, the State reports in most of the States.as well as reports in this bureau 
will be much improved. If the appropriations asked for other purposes are made, it 
will be possible to so reorganize the present force of the bureau as to make it possible 
to carry out this plan of cooperation at a cost little greater than that of the present 
inadequate plan. To make it entirely effective, some additional legislation may be 
necessary in some States. This can be had, I think, within a reasonable time. 
That the work of the bureau may be brought to the attention of teachers and school 
officers in the most effective way, and that the Commissioner of Education may have
-P-A-G-E-17
  THE COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION. XVII. 
first-hand knowledge of conditions and needs which will enable him to direct the 
work of the bureau most effectively, he should spend much of his time in the field, 
attending conventions of teachers, school officers, and others interested directly and 
indirectly in the problems of education, visiting and inspecting typical schools of 
all kinds .and grades, and conferring with such people as can be helpful to the bureau 
in carrying on any part of its work. The commissioner should .also, as far as possible, 
be relieved from the routine and details of office duty, to the end that he may have 
more time to plan and direct more effectively the larger work of the bureau. 1 there- 
fore recommend that the position of assistant commissioner of education be created, 
and that sufficient traveling expenses be allowed for both the commissioner and the 
assistant commissioner. The assistant commissioner should be a specialist in sec- 
ondary education and serve also as chief of a division of high-school education in the 
bureau. 
The division of higher education in the bureau, with a specialist in higher educa- 
tion at its head, should be strengthened by the addition of a specialist in normal- 
school education and the training of teachers, a specialist in agricultural education 
to have general supervision of the expenditure of the large amount of money given 
annually by the Federal Government for the support of agricultural and mechanical 
colleges, and a specialist in agricultural education to give his time to the agricultural 
and mechanical colleges for negroes in the Southern States, helping them to a better 
use of the funds they receive from the Federal Government. The salary of the special- 
ist in higher education should be so increased as to enable the bureau to retain the 
services of a competent man in that position. This division should have at least 
three additional clerks. 
Much more than half the children in the United States live under rural conditions 
in small towns, villages, and gpen country. All their education must come through 
rural schools. The rural-school problem is admitted to.be the most difficult of all 
school problems. This bureau has in the past been able to give very little direct help 
toward its solution. There should be in the bureau a comparatively lange group of 
competent men and women giving their entire time and energies to this problem, 
with freedom, under the direction of the commissioner, to study it directly as well as 
indirectly wherever it can be studied to best advantage, to prepare bulletins on this 
subject for the general information of the people, and to go to any part of the country 
to give direct and specific assistance whenever needed. 
Over all the world the demand for industrial, or vocational, education is growing. 
In our own country, teachers and laymen in urban and rural communities alike are 
demanding that the schools shall do something to prepare the masses of boys and 
girls for effective service in some industrial occupation, fit them to make a living, 
and to contribute their part to the commonwealth. How this shall be done and in 
what kind of schools no one seems to know certainly and fully. Experiments of 
many kinds are tried in many places. Much money is being spent for it and much 
more will be spent, more or less wisely. Commissions are sent abroad to study the 
efforts of other countries to solve this problem. Committees have been appointed by 
many societies in this country to investigate and report upon it. Education con- 
ventions devote their programs to it. A mational society for the promotion of this 
kind of education has done much valuable work. There is great need in this bureau 
for a group of competent specialists and assistants to study the various phases of this 
problem; bring together and digest the work and reports of associations, committees, 
and commissions; help toward the formulation of some clearly understood fundamental 
principles; and assist State, county, and city boards and supervisors in working out 
their practical application, either in the ordinary schools, modified for this purpose, 
or in new kinds of schools, as may finally seem most wise. 
Twenty million children and young people in the United States spend a good por- 
tion of their time in school every year. The indoor sedentary life required by the work  
-P-A-G-E-18
  XVI EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
and discipline of the school is more or less unnatural for childhood and youth, and 
unless the conditions under which the school work is done are intelligently controlled, 
there is constant and grave danger that the health of the children may be injured, 
their vitality lowered, and their happiness and their value as citizens diminished 
throughout their lives. Modern science has brought to light many important prin- 
ciples of health, the means of the application of which should be known to all teachers 
and school officers. The Federal Government should give to the health of its children 
and future citizens not less care and attention than it gives to the health of the live 
stock of the country. To this end there should be in this bureau a specialist in school 
hygiene and sanitation, and he should have assistants and clerks to enable him to do 
this work effectively. 
The growth of our cities has been very rapid, and the number of large cities in the 
country has become very great. In such cities a large proportion of the public revenues 
is spent on the schools. The demands on these schools are more numerous every year 
than they were the year before. The problems of city school administration therefore 
are ever more difficult and complex. With a competent specialist in city school 
administration and an efficient group of assistants and clerks, this bureau could render 
valuable and much-needed service to the cities. It should be enabled to do it. 
The bureau now has one of the most complete collections of books, pamphlets, and 
reports on education in the world, and many thousands of bound volumes and pam- 
phletsare added toiteach year. Thislibrary should be made more serviceable, not only 
to the members of the bureau itself, but also to students in education throughout the 
country. To investigators in all phases of education it should become the chief source 
of information. All such students and investigators should come freely to this library, 
and the material in the library should be sent freely tothem, Ineithercase they should 
receive from the bureau effective help in their studies and investigations and wise 
guidance in the use of the material in the library. For this purpose and for the supervi- 
sion of the preparation of many bulletins which the bureau has prepared from time to 
time by individuals and committees outside its own staff, there should be-in the bureau 
a man well versed in the history, theory, and practice of education, who might give 
his entire time to this work. The bureau should also be able to carry on cooperative 
studies in secondary and elementary education under varying conditions in different 
parts of the country, securing for this purpose the services of expert teachers and 
supervisors. A small appropriation for this purpose could be made to bring very large 
results. The bureau needs also an assistant editor, a skilled librarian, and at least one 
additional translator. For the salaries of the specialists, assistants, and clerks required 
for the purposes here set forth and for expenses for travel and other purposes necessary 
to make their work effective I am submitting estimates for new appropriations, 
amounting to $140,420. I feel sure every dollar of this can be used by the bureau for 
the effective service of the country. 
Respectfully submitted.

CHAPTER I. 
A BRIEF SURVEY OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS DURING 
THE DECADE 1900 TO 1910. 
By Fietoner B. Dressiar, 
Chief of the Editorial Division, Bureau of Education (Chief of the Division of School Sanitation and Hygiene 
since October 19, 1911). 
INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT. 
The purpose of this survey is to set forth some of the more salient 
features of educational development in the United States during the 
first decade of the new century. 
No one who has watched this growth will believe that it is possible 
to express it in any sort of completeness by statistical methods alone; 
but some of the more general and objective features can be handled 
in this manner, and by means of comparisons, general movements 
forward or backward may be seen. School statistics generally avail- 
able, however, are faulty, and no amount of effort can correct them 
so long as the various States ask for returns on different and varying 
bases. Hence all general conclusions reached as a result of the study 
of the educational statistics of the country must be taken with due 
allowance unless supported by evidence from other sources. It may 
not be out of place at this point to say that this office is working with 
all diligence to get correct and comparable returns from all States and 
that a plan presented looking toward this end has been indorsed by 
the Department of Superintendence of the National Educational 
Association at the Mobile meeting in 1911. Within the coming 
decade it is expected that more reliable returns will be available and 
that they will be ready for publication in the year to which they 
relate. At any rate, this bureau is determined to make the attempt. 
RELATIVE DECREASE IN SCHOOL POPULATION. 
In 1900 the total population in the States was 75,602,515. In 1910 
it had reached 91,972,266, or an increase of more than 21 per cent 
over that of 1900. But it is an interesting and quite significant fact 
that that part of our population represented by children between the 
ages of 5 and 18, or, in other words, the common-school population, 
had increased within the same 10 years less than 15 percent. In the 
previous decade (that is, from 1890 to 1900) there was an increase of 
13144°—xp 1911—vo1 1——1 
 
-P-A-G-E-20
- . de “= 2 : 
2 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
the school population of more than 17 per cent, and from 1880 to 
1890 the increase was more than 23 per cent. During these three 
decades, then, while the population as a whole has been increasing at 
a steady rate, the rate of increase in the school population has appar- 
ently dropped from more than 23 per cent to less than 15 per cent. 
These figures include the total school population, both white and 
black, but since the percentage of white children from 5 to 18 years 
of age has kept pace with that of colored children of the same ages 
for the same period, it is safe to assert that the above figures approx- 
imate the truth with reference to the steadily decreasing percentage 
of white children dependent on a given number of adults for educa- 
tional support. 
Mr. North, former Director of the Census, has said: 
The uninterrupted increase shown in the proportion of white adults of self-supporting 
age to white children proves exceedingly suggestive. At the First Census (1790) 780 
adults contributed to the maintenance and rearing of 1,000 children in the United 
States, but in 1900 the relationship of adults to children had changed so greatly that 
the ratio became 1,580 adults to each 1,000 children. (A Century of Population. 
Growth, p. 104.) 
While the above conclusions were made on the basis of the total 
number of white children from 1 to 16 years of age and of white adults 
over 20 years of age through a whole century, they certainly tend to 
corroborate the general conclusion mentioned, that, relatively speak- 
ing, the school population (5 to 18) is decreasing in a rather remarkable 
manner. 
Aside from the general civic problems growing out of such a situa- 
tion, it will be seen at once that many misconceptions concerning 
the expenditure per pupil for educational purposes could easily arise. 
For example, it would now cost New England very little more per 
adult to give each of her children $20 worth of educational advan- 
tages than it would cost the South, per adult, all other conditions 
equal, to give her children $10 worth of schooling. While the middle, 
northern, and western divisions of States do not as a whole show 
either of these extremes to so striking a degree, there is, nevertheless, 
a good deal of variation. The real test, then, of the willingness of 
any State or section to do its duty in the educational support of its 
children may be measured more accurately by the cost per capita of 
adult population than by the expenditure per capita of the school 
population. 
During the decade under consideration the percentage of the school 
population (5 to 18 years of age) enrolled in the public schools shows 
a_slight decrease as compared with that of the previous decade. 
Whether this decrease is real or whether the statistics representing 
the last year of this decade are not exactly comparable with those 
of the first year of the decade it is impossible tosay. But there seems 
to be some probability that the country as a whole has reached approx-
-P-A-G-E-21
SURVEY OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS, 1900-1910, 3 
  imately a sort of tableland in the heretofore up-grade movement 
in the percentage of enrollment of the public-school population. 
However, this general statement must be used with caution. In 
several of the Southern States, notably Mississippi, Louisiana, 
Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, West Virginia, and Texas, 
advances have been made; while some of the Western States also show 
an increase. 
AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE. 
It seems, however, that if the percentage of enrollment has not 
increased, or has even decreased, a better showing has been made in 
the average daily attendance. In 1900, the average daily attendance 
in the public schools was 10,632,772, which was 68.6 per cent of the 
enrollment; in 1909, the average daily attendance reached 12,684,837, 
being 72.5 per cent of the number enrolled. These figures, taken 
with the fact that they correspond rather closely to the progress of 
those representing the attendance for the several intervening years, 
seem to warrant the general conclusion that the children have attended 
the public schools more regularly during the past decade than in any 
previous one in our educational history. But there is still great 
room for improvement. There were in 1909, as shown by the sta- 
tistical tables, 24,239,820 children 5 to 18 years of age; but only 
12,684,837 were in actual attendance. That is to say, nearly one- 
half of the school population of 1909 was out of the public school each 
day during the year. - This statement does not take into account the 
fact that most children have finished the elementary work several 
years earlier, and that many of them did not enter until 6 years of 
age, or even later. It is based on statistics gathered by this bureau 
to designate the school population, i. e., the number of children that 
might be in attendance at some school. By summarizing the two 
sets of figures involved, it is shown that, while the facts regarding the 
attendance are not what could be wished, there has been a slight, but 
steady increase in the percentage of average daily attendance during 
the decade. 
INCREASE IN THE LENGTH OF SCHOOL TERM. 
A still more significant fact, however, comes to light when the sta- 
tistics relating to the length of the school term are examined. Taking 
the country as a whole, the length of the school term has increased 
from 144.3 days in 1900 to 155.3 days in 1909. The highest average 
in the history of the American school system was reached, therefore, 
in 1909, and all evidence at hand points to the continued increase of 
this average. This means that over one-half of a school month has 
been added to the average length of the school term, and in this 
particular alone educational effectiveness has been increased during 
the decade about 8 per cent.
-P-A-G-E-22
EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
AVERAGE NUMBER OF DAYS ATTENDED. 
  The average number of days attended by each pupil enrolled has 
increased in an unbroken and steady fashion from 99 days in 1900 to 
112.6 days in 1909. While averages of this sort are more or less 
unconvincing and even at times misleading, in this particular they 
seem to be significant. On the basis of these figures, and on corrobora- 
tive evidence, it can be asserted that during the past decade there 
has been a healthy growth in regularity of attendance, and that no 
previous year in the history of the common schools shows such a high 
_ mark in this regard as the year 1910. The significance of this state- 
ment will be understood most readily by teachers, and will, it is hoped, 
encourage some of them to renewed efforts to keep the children in 
school. Regular attendance means consistent and regular growth. 
A few irregulars seriously break the continuity of the whole work of 
the school. Just what elements have been instrumental in raising 
this average it is impossible*to specify. Doubtless, medical inspec- 
tion, compulsory-attendance laws, closer supervision, better adapta- 
tion of subject matter to the needs of the children, better housing, 
and many other factors have combined to bring about this result. 
NUMBER OF PUBLIC-SCHOOL TEACHERS. 
In 1900 the number of public-school teachers reached the total of 
423,062, with approximately 30 men in each hundred teachers. In 
1909 there were 506,040 teachers in public-school service, but the 
number of men had dropped to approximately 21 to the hundred. 
This relative elimination of men teachers from the public schools 
has been going on steadily and rapidly since 1880. Much has been 
written about this part of recent educational history, and lamentation 
because of the possible dangers involved has been often heard. There 
is no doubt that it is unwise to intrust so important a matter as the 
teaching of boys and girls so largely to women; but the facts are 
known and have been for many years, and yet the hoped-for change 
does not come. 
WAGES OF TEACHERS. 
The average monthly wages of teachers can not be stated with 
accuracy because of the fact that the statistics gathered during the 
decade on this particular item are incomplete. But it can be stated 
with some assurance that the monthly salaries have increased for 
men in the neighborhood of 35 per cent, and for women about 25 per 
cent. The average monthly salary for men teachers was given in 
1900 as $46.53; in 1909 it had increased to $63.39. The increase in 
wages for women teachers for the same period was from $38.93 per 
month to $50.08. It must not be forgotten, however, that while the
-P-A-G-E-23
  
  SURVEY OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS, 1900-1910. 5 
monthly salary has increased, the average length of the school term 
has also increased, and therefore the annual salary has increased to a 
much greater degree than the monthly salary alone would indicate. 
Doubtless one reason why the average salary of men has increased 
more rapidly than that of women lies in the fact that relatively a 
much greater number of the men have been engaged in supervisory 
work, and in this capacity command larger salaries. 
NUMBER OF SCHOOLHOUSES. 
Taking the decade as a whole the number of houses used for public- 
school purposes has increased from 248,279 in 1900 to 257,851 in 1909. 
It is interesting to note that during the last two or three years of this 
period there has been no appreciable increase. This is probably due 
to the movement for consolidation in country districts, to the recent 
period of financial depression, and to the continued increase in the 
urban population where larger buildings are being constructed. 
VALUE OF SCHOOL PROPERTY. 
The total value of all public-school property has increased from 
$550,531,217 in 1900 to the enormous sum of $967,775,587 in 1909. 
While it is impossible to specify in detail what particular items have 
been relatively most influential in this wonderful increase in our 
public-school equipment, it seems safe to say that by far the most 
important one is that of better and larger school buildings. This has 
been preeminently a period of advance in the style and quality of our 
school architecture. Not only are larger buildings built, but many of 
them are constructed of permanent materials and are equipped with 
modern conveniences, better furniture, more extensive libraries, and 
various new departments for the teaching of the sciences and their 
applications in the daily affairs of life.. No one who is conversant 
with the educational history of the world will fail to see evidences of a 
movement which can not be matched from the records of the past. 
Greece and Rome in the days of their greatest advances knew naught 
of school buildings as they exist to-day. Far more money is invested 
in public-school property than was required to maintain all the 
machinery of our Federal Government in 1910. 
But let us not boast of good works and forget those useless expenses 
of our so-called enlightened civilization. We spend each year for 
purposes which all reason and scientific investigation condemn as 
harmful enough money to duplicate all our school buildings and have 
millions of dollars left for providing worthy playgrounds for our 
children.

SOURCES OF PUBLIC-SCHOOL REVENUE. 
Turning now to the sources whence the public schools derive their 
revenue, it will be seen by consulting the figures for the decade that 
the following statements represent approximately the facts: 
The income from permanent funds and rents has increased from 
$9,152,274 in 1900 to $13,746,826 in 1909, though it appears from the 
figures for the years 1906-7 and 1907-8 that a much larger revenue 
was derived from these sources than at any period in our history. 
These figures as they stand are evidently for some reason not com- 
parable with those for the other years of the decade, for there seem 
to be no adequate causes for such variations. 
During the years under consideration the income from State taxes 
has grown steadily from $37,281,256 in 1900 to $63,247,354 in 1909. 
The increase has been regular and consistent. This is evidence of 
stable laws in this regard and of the increasing willingness of the 
States to meet their just obligations in matters of public education. 
But the most encouraging sign in the matter of school revenues is the 
striking growth in the amount of public-school funds derived from 
local taxation. In 1900 the total receipts from this source amounted 
to $149,486,845; but in 1909 the total had reached the sum of 
$288,642,500, an increase of over 90 per cent. This is the most sig- 
nificant fact in the financial statistics for the period. It means that 
education is largely and directly in the hands of the people and that 
they are meeting the financial demands loyally. Those States which 
still persist in preventing the people from exercising the right to local 
taxation for school purposes are surely out of line with the democratic 
faith so strikingly shown by these figures. Whatever qualms may 
arise at times on account of civic inefficiency in other lines of endeavor, 
it is plain that the American people believe in the education of their 
children and are willing to pay for it directly, out of their own pockets. 
It ought to be noted in this connection, too, that there is a growing 
tendency in the States to enact laws ‘‘requiring more careful auditing 
of accounts and a greater publicity of the local financial affairs of the 
public schools.” (Details regarding this point can be found in Bul- 
letin No. 7, 1908, prepared for this bureau by Prof. E. C. Elliott.) 
The total income from all sources for the common schools has 
increased from $219,765,989 in 1900 to $403,647,289 in 1909. This 
is truly a remarkable showing. During this time the population has 
increased only about 20 per cent and the school population in the 
neighborhood of 15 per cent, while the total income for common 
schools has increased more than 83 per cent. As indicated above, 
the large item in this increase is the income from local taxation. 
This fact adds great significance to these figures; for not only does it 
emphasize, as already indicated, the willingness of the people to sup- 
port their common schools in an immediate and direct way, but it 
 
-P-A-G-E-25
  SURVEY OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS, 1900-1910, a 
should furnish a striking object lesson to those States which are yet 
afraid, apparently, to trust the people with power to tax themselves 
for the adequate support of their common schools. 
COST OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 
The expense account of our public schools shows an increase from 
$214,964,618 in 1900 to $401,397,747 in 1909, or about 86 per cent. 
But since, as was shown earlier in this chapter, the population as a 
whole is growing more rapidly than the school population, it has cost 
relatively a smaller increase per capita of the total population to 
meet this increasing expenditure. It cost $2.84 per capita of popu- 
lation to meet the school expenditures in 1900 and $4.45 in 1909, or 
an increase of only about 56 per cent, to meet an increase in total 
expenditure of 86 per cent. We have a right, therefore, to expect 
better educational care of our children at a relatively slower increase 
in cost per capita of population. The number of children of school 
age per 1,000 of the population is rapidly and steadily declining and 
the increasing cost per capita of population for their schooling should 
result in better educational advantages for each child than in any 
previous decade. The total expenditure per pupil for common- 
school purposes in 1900 was $20.21. In 1909 it had increased to 
$31.65, or at the rate of 56 percent. This increased cost per pupil has 
resulted largely from the relatively larger expenditures made for 
buildings, sites, furniture, libraries, and general school equipment. 
There has been a steady falling off in the percentage of the total 
common-school income devoted to salaries for the teachers. In 1900 
64 per cent of the total expenditure was devoted to salaries; in 1909 
this had decreased to 59.2 per cent, and it declined steadily through 
the intervening years. While it is to be hoped that in the next 
decade this upward trend in better equipment will be continued, good 
buildings and good equipment generally can not take the place of 
better teachers. 
PROGRESS IN KINDERGARTENS. 
In 1900 there were approximately 250 cities of a population of 
4,000 or over in which public kindergartens were maintained in 
direct connection with the city systems of schools. There were 
employed in these cities 3,326 kindergarten teachers, and the total 
enrollment of kindergarten pupils was 131,657. In 1909, the latest 
date for which statistics are available, there were about 400 cities 
with a population of 4,000 or over which maintained kindergartens. 
For this work 5,887 teachers were employed, and 185,471 children 
were enrolled. By a study of the details upon which, these figures 
are based, it appears that many of the smaller cities which did not 
include kindergarten work in 1900 have, during the decade, made
-P-A-G-E-26
    8 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
some provision for it, and that many larger cities have extended the 
work. Comparatively speaking, there are few cities in the South 
that include the kindergarten as a part of their school systems, but 
there has been a decided growth in this direction. The States of 
the North are the most progressive in this regard. In Michigan, for. 
example, there are 35 cities with public kindergartens. Naturaily, 
the cosmopolitan cities show the greatest increase. 
It has been said that while the philosophy upon which the kinder- 
garten was founded is German, the development of this form of 
school work has come to be peculiarly American. To this may be 
added the fact that the American kindergartner is rarely able to 
understand the more or less mystic philosophy of Freebel, and has 
therefore shaped her work to suit the practical life of the American 
people. It is to be hoped that this tendency will not carry too far 
and rob the work of that splendid element of idealism which should 
be the heart and soul of all kindergarten training. To meet more 
successfully the demands implied in the name, the work must not be 
allowed to degenerate into another form of indoor teacher-directed 
activity. 
CITY SCHOOL ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION. 
Progress in city school organization and administration for the 
decade is expressed in many lines of development. The regular 
school work has been enlarged so as to include more manual and 
vocational training for the boys, and larger opportunities for domestic 
science for the girls. Commercial courses and courses in stenog- 
raphy and typewriting have multiplied in the high schools, and 
increased emphasis has been put upon the application of school work 
in its relation to the daily life of the citizen. Decided progress has 
been made in school buildings, and especially in the demand for 
larger playgrounds, social recreation centers, school baths, medical 
inspection, care of defectives, and better sanitation in general. 
Classes have been organized for exceptional children, and continua- 
tion and evening schools increased in number. 
The city school boards are composed of fewer members, and their 
work has been outlined under fewer committees. Instead of ap- 
pointing or electing members of city boards from wards, they are 
now more frequently appointed or elected as representatives of the 
city at large. This change deserves the highest commendation both 
as a means of ridding the schools of the baneful influence of ward 
politics and as a unifying agency in school supervision. 
PROGRESS IN HIGH SCHOOLS. 
The development of public high schools during this period consti- 
tutes one of the remarkable features of educational progress in the 
first years of the new century. This development expresses itself
-P-A-G-E-27
  SURVEY OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS, 1900-1910. 9 
not only in numbers, but in the quality and quantity of the work 
‘done. The high schools are more effectively reaching all classes and 
adapting their work to meet the needs of the masses.in a very sig- 
nificant and vital fashion. Meanwhile the courses offered to meet 
college requirements have not been seriously disturbed, and at the 
_. game time a more vital affiliation between the colleges nee high 
schools has been fostered. 
In 1900 there were approximately 6,005 public high sahindled in the 
United States. In 1910 there were 10,213, or an increase of a little 
over 70 per cent in the 10 years. The number of teachers employed 
in public secondary schools in 1900 was 20,372. In 1910 there were 
41,667 teachers in public high schools, or an increase of more than 
100 per cent in the decade. The number of pupils attending public 
high schools in 1900 was approximately 519,251, but by 1910 the 
number had increased to 915,061, or more than 76 per cent. When 
we institute a comparison between the public and private high schools 
in these regards we find that the number of private secondary schools 
has decreased during the decade and that the number of teachers 
has increased only about 10 per cent. The number of students in 
private high schools has increased only about 7 per cent. 
Within the 10 years the ratio between the numbers of boys and 
- girls in public high schools has changed very little, but there has been 
a slight increase in the percentage of boys. In 1900 of all the stu- 
dents in public secondary schools, approximately 41 per cent were 
boys and 59 per cent were girls; in 1910 in every 100 students 43 
were boys. The proportion of high school students preparing for 
college has apparently decreased in the decade from about 10.8 to 
approximately 5.5 per cent. This does not mean that fewer stu- 
dents enter college from high schools, but that there has been a 
great increase in the number of students who are making the high 
schools their finishing schools. The percentage of graduates has 
changed very little for 20 years. The graduates are approximately 
12 per cent of the enrollment each year, and about a third of these 
are prepared for college. The emphasis upon the various subjects 
of study is indicated by the following table: 
Number of students, in each 1,000 enrolled in public high schools, studying the various

By comparing these two columns one can see that Latin is holding 
its ground; Greek is disappearing; French and German are gain- 
ing—German more than French; algebra occupies a large share of 
the time and is steady; geometry is gaining; trigonometry is rarely 
taken, but has not changed; all the older sciences, rather strangely, 
are relatively falling off; English and history have gained materially. 
The subjects of zoology, botany, agriculture, stenography and type- 
writing, and domestic economy have appeared in the list of studies 
in recent years, but no comparisons for the decade are possible. 
GROWTH OF NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
There has been marked progress in the work of the public normal 
schools within the decade. In 1900 appropriation of public funds 
to the amount of $2,769,003 was made for the support of normal 
schools. In 1910 the appropriations for this purpose amounted to 
$6,630,357. Meanwhile, during the last three years of this decade, 
more money had been spent for buildings than during the whole 
period from 1890 to 1900. In the year 1900 there were 1,068 men 
and 1,847 women employed as normal-school teachers in the various 
States. In 1910 there were 1,692 men and 3,122 women so employed. 
While it is impossible to exhibit the facts in statistical form, it is 
true that the teaching force of public normal schools has largely 
increased in efficiency. Specialists who have been trained in uni- 
versities and colleges have taken the places of those who had gone 
little or no further than they were expected to take their students. 
Laboratories for the study of the sciences have been multiplied and 
a higher grade of scholarship has been demanded of both teacher and 
students. : 
In 1900, out of a total number of 47,421 students in the professional 
courses of public normal schools, 12,432, or a little over 26 per cent, 
were males. In 1910 in corresponding courses, there were 79,546 
students; 17,096, or a little over 21 per cent of them, were males. 
These figures foretell a still further reduction in the relative number 
of men teachers for the public schools. 
There is a rapidly growing conviction that the entrance require- 
ments for the normal school should not be lower than that for college; 
or in other words that the completion of a four-year high-school 
course should be the minimum requirement. Several States have 
such requirements, and it is to be hoped that all will come to this as 
soon as practicable. This would permit the normal schools to devote 
their time mainly to the professional side, and save the States the 
expense now made necessary by duplicating the work of the sec- 
ondary schools. The conditions in some parts of the country, how- 
ever, do not yet warrant this change, but the time is rapidly approach- 
ing when this requirement ought to prevail in every State.
-P-A-G-E-29
  
SURVEY OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS, 1900-1910. If 
During the last years of the period under consideration, there 
seems to have been an unmistakable tendency for the stronger high 
schools to include in their work certain courses designed to prepare 
students to teach in the common schools. Kansas has inaugurated 
this movement in-a large majority of her better high schools, and 
Arkansas, Iowa, and other States are doing the same thing. Such 
courses are not designed to take the place of normal-school courses, 
but rather to help in some measure, by giving to those who would 
otherwise enter upon the work of teaching without any professional 
preparation some insight into the purposes and methods of the 
common schools, especially the rural schools. The plan is still on 
trial, and in order to succeed it will need wise guidance and careful 
limitations. 
GENERAL AGENCIES FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHERS. 
The various agencies at work for the improvement of teachers 
already in service have increased in effectiveness during the decade 
and promise even better results in the near future. Teachers’ 
institutes, reading circles, State and local summer schools, school- 
improvement work, etc., are gradually becoming more effective, 
are reaching a greater number of the teachers and the more progres- 
sive communities as a whole. In a bulletin published by this bureau 
this phase of educational work is treated exhaustively.t 
HIGHER EDUCATION. 
In the realm of higher education the decade just closed has been 
marked rather by reorganization and the development of the spirit 
of wider service than by the founding of great institutions. Vast 
expansion of function, both upward and outward; notable elevation 
of standards, especially of graduate and professional education, 
accompanied by thoroughgoing investigation and discussion of the 
subjects and methods of instruction; distinct improvement in busi- 
ness organization and administration in both public and private 
institutions; unprecedented drafting of university experts into State 
and Federal service; and unparalleled increases in registration, 
endowment, and income are all features of the progress of the past 
10 years. The increase in revenues from taxation in the case of 
tax-supported institutions has greatly outstripped the increased 
incomes of endowed private institutions. The following figures will 
illustrate various phases of this noteworthy development from 1900 
to 1910: The attendance of collegiate and resident graduate students 
in the universities, colleges, and schools of technology for men, for 
both sexes, and for women, rose from 109,929 to 183,583; the num-

ber of professors and instructors from 16,921 to 27,279; productive 
funds from $166,193,529 to $273,423,328; and income, exclusive of 
additions to endowment, from $28,558,463 to $77,873,367. At the 
close of the decade 177 colleges and universities were maintaining 
departments of education designed not only to train teachers for 
secondary schools but also to develop a general interest in the larger 
questions of public education. 
PROGRESS IN THE TEACHING OF AGRICULTURE. 
In 10 years the number of students in the agricultural and mech- 
anical colleges, in the regular four-year courses in agriculture, has 
increased more than threefold. These colleges have established 
extension work in agriculture td re reaching farmers throughout 
the States by every form of extension teaching: Educational trains, 
farmers’ institutes, lecture courses, short courses at the colleges and 
at other centers, correspondence courses, summer schools, traveling 
expert advisers, farm demonstration work, etc. Many are offering 
four-year, two-year, and one-year courses for teachers in agriculture. 
Several colleges other than those in the list of ‘‘land-grant”’ institu- 
tions are introducing agricultural courses. 
Agriculture has been permanently introduced into the curricula of 
very many public schools. There are about 100 agricultural second-_ 
ary schools supported in whole or in part by the States in which they 
are located—district schools of Georgia, State schools of New York, 
county schools of Wisconsin, etc. About 2,000 public high schools 
give instruction in agriculture as a separate subject in more or less 
complete courses. Courses in agriculture are given in 106 State 
normal schools. | 
Agriculture is a required subject in all common schools of 12 States; 
in the rural schools of 5, and in the rural high schools of 3. It is 
required for teachers’ certificates in 16, and is optional in 3. Special 
agricultural schools receiving State aid are established in 16 States, 
and are authorized in North Dakota. State aid to departments-of 
agriculture in high schools is given in 12 States. Secondary schools 
of agriculture or secondary courses in agriculture, in addition to the 
collegiate courses, are maintained by the State agricultural colleges 
of 31 States. Summer schools giving elementary agriculture for 
teachers are conducted by 34 of these institutions, and short courses 
for farmers of from 2 to 12 weeks are maintained by the majority of 
them. In another part of this volume can be found detailed informa- 
tion bearing on recent progress in agricultural education. 
FORESTRY SCHOOLS. 
There were no schools of forestry 10 years ago, although brief 
courses were given in a few of the agricultural and mechanical col-
-P-A-G-E-31
  
SURVEY OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS, 1900-1910, - 13 
leges before the Yale Forest School was established in 1900. Now 
there are 5 graduate schools giving the master’s degree, 18 colleges 
giving four-year courses leading to the bachelor’s degree, and. at 
least 25 giving shorter courses from one-half to one year under the 
general courses in botany or horticulture. There are, also, two pro- 
fessional schools of forestry, which require no preliminary college 
training, and a few secondary schools offering work in forestry. 
EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE SOUTHERN STATES. 
In the Southern States the average length of the school term has 
increased from approximately 5 months fo over 6 months, and the 
average number of days of schooling given for every child from 5 to 
18 years of age has increased from 45 to 56 days. 
The public high schools for white children in the Southern States 
have increased in numbers in a very encouraging manner. In 1900 
there were, as shown by the figures furnished this office, 1,032 public 
high schools for white children; by 1910 this number had increased 
to 2,194, or more than 100 per cent. The number of teachers 
employed for these schools had increased from 2,648 to 6,482, or 
more than 144 per cent. The number of students in 1900 amounted 
to 62,289; in 1910 there were 137,469, a growth of 120 per cent. 
This rapid development of the secondary schools in the South 
promises great good to the people of that section of the country. 
Heretofore many boys and girls were denied the privilege of high- 
school training for their life’s work because of their inability to meet 
the expense connected with such training in private schools or in 
public high schools in the larger cities. This condition is rapidly 
giving way, and in a few years no ambitious boy or girl in this section 
will be thus handicapped. Moreover, the high schools that are 
springing up in all parts of the South are in the main wisely adjusted 
to the conditions of the South, both as college preparatory schools 
and as preparatory to life’s demands. It is especially noteworthy 
to find a wholesome classical and literary spirit being developed in 
conjunction with training in agriculture and for scientific pursuits. 
One of the serious difficulties the South is now called to face is to 
secure a sufficient number of virile men well prepared to conduct the 
high schools and to become safe leaders in this educational renais- 
sance. Until recent times, law, medicine, and the ministry have 
absorbed the most promising men. By reason of the peculiar con- 
ditions and the prestige of these professions in the South, it will 
require a great deal of work and higher standards of teaching and 
better salaries to turn a sufficient number of good men toward 
educational work. As it is now, it is more difficult to find well- 
prepared men to manage and lead educational affairs in the South 
than it is in the North.  
-P-A-G-E-32
    14 : EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
In 1900 the estimated number of white children from 5 to 18 years 
of age in the Southern States was 5,892,392. The number had 
increased to 6,566,184 in 1909, or over 11 per cent. The total 
enrollment in the common schools for white children had increased 
from 4,261,309 to 4,909,283, a gain of over 15 per cent. The average 
daily attendance had increased from a total of 2,775,059 to 3,257,185, 
or above 17 per cent. The number of teachers in 1900 was 98,710, 
and in 1909 it was 122,941, a gain of more than 24 per cent. 
One of the peculiar features of public education in the South lies 
in the fact that local taxation for school purposes is limited. In 
several of these States in 1900 the amount raised by local taxation 
was but little over half as much as that appropriated by the States 
directly. The money appropriated by 11 Southern States for public 
schools in 1900 amounted to $14,843,787. For the same year the 
total amount raised by local taxation in these States was $20,616,445. 
Ohio alone in 1900 raised $20,825,730 by local taxation, while from 
her State funds were appropriated only $2,100,794. This centralized 
form of school control and school maintenance in the South is grad- 
ually giving way to a more democratic local form of school manage- 
ment. Commenting on this fact of centralization in school matters, 
Mr. R. H. Powell, jr., the Rural School Supervisor for Georgia, has 
said: ‘There is a tendency to look to the State to do all for educa- 
tion—a dangerously undemocratic tendency toward centralization 
of government and destruction of local self-reliance.” 
WORK OF THE SOUTHERN EDUCATION BOARD, 
The Southern Education Board, formally organized in New York 
City November 3, 1901, was a direct outgrowth of conferences which 
had been held first at Capron Springs, W. Va., and later at Winston 
Salem, N. C. It is not incorporated. Its officers at present are: 
Chairman, Robert C. Ogden, New York City; treasurer, George 
Foster Peabody, New York City; executive secretary, Wickliffe 
Rose, Washington, D. C. 
The purposes set forth at its organization and so successfully 
carried out during the decade, are as follows: 
1. To conduct a campaign of education for free schools for all the 
people, by Supplying literature to the newspapers and periodical 
press, by participating in educational meetings, and by general 
correspondence. 
2. To conduct a bureau of information and advice on legislation 
and school organization. 
3. For these purposes this board is authorized.to raise funds and 
disburse them, to employ a secretary or agent, and to do whatever 
may be necessary to carry out effectively these measures, and others 
that may from time to time be found feasible and desirable,
-P-A-G-E-33
  
SURVEY OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS, 1900-1910, 15 
The value of the service this board has rendered is inestimable; 
its influence has been felt in the remotest corners of 11 Southern | 
States. Systematic campaigns have been undertaken in all these 
States, and the doctrines and needs of public education preached to the 
common people, as well as to those who have had better advantages. 
In Mr. G. S. Dickerman’s “Review of Five Years of Educational 
Progress in the South,” published by the Southern Education Board 
October, 1907, accounts of some of these campaigns are given, and 
they should be read by all who would appreciate the work of this 
board, as well as by those who are seeking to understand the causes 
of the great-educational awakening of the South. In a very decided 
way the Southern Education Board has understood the needs of the 
South and has helped where help was needed, and has encouraged 
in the most practical manner. 
VOCATIONAL TRAINING, 
Since the close of the past century the ideals, purposes, and courses 
of study for the public schools have been examined with a thorough- 
ness and discussed with an earnestness commendable in the highest — 
degree. As a result there has come about a general demand that 
more time should be given to training in English, nature study, 
manual training, and, especially in the last years of the decade, to 
vocational training. For the boys this has usually taken the form 
of workin wood andiron. Girls have had much variety of work, often 
disconnected and unorganized. From manual training more or less 
like that given to the boys, they have in recent years been turned 
toward those lines of work that every housekeeper ought to know 
and be able to do, such as cooking, sewing, caring for infants, and 
supervising intelligently the outlay for food and clothing for the 
family. This latter movement promises more definite results, and 
offers far more opportunities for real usefulness as well as culture 
than much that was given earlier in the name of manual training. 
One can foretell without appreciable error what, in the main, the life 
work of 90 per cent of the women of the next generation will be. 
Hence it ought to be comparatively easy to work out a course of study 
for girls which will result in definite training for that which is really 
and surely coming. The children of the future will learn their 
mothers’ language, absorb their mothers’ culture, and be largely 
subject to their mothers’ guidance. The future mother will have to 
spend much time and thought on clothing, cooking, washing, and the 
general care of her children, just as mothers do to-day. There will 
be houses to build and furnish; houses to clean and keep clean; 
mending to do; health conditions to consider; plans for entertaining 
friends; and, perhaps more than now, definite and thoughtful con- 
sideration of how to make life worth while on a meager and some- 
   
-P-A-G-E-34
  
  16 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
times irregular income. Surely thoughtful women teachers ought to 
be able to see in this newer phase of training for girls a great oppor- 
tunity for real culture, as well as specific preparation for housekeeping. 
Meanwhile the work is still chaotic, and needs adjustment and revision. 
The old form of manual training for boys has doubtless served 
‘ useful purposes, but for the most part it has been too indefinite and 
theoretical. The highly elaborated and logical system of sloyd has 
not taken hold of boy nature in a vital way, because it is based too 
exclusively on mere drill work, and too rarely produces a product 
worth the endeavor. In some way boys must be allowed to under- 
take real problems if a real lively interest in manual work is 
desired. It is far more educational for a boy to undertake to make 
a chair and get an imperfect product than it is to simply practice 
sawing, planing, carving, cutting, and boring. 
The future occupations of boys can not be foretold with the same 
degree of certainty as those for girls. The variety of opportunities, 
duties, and responsibilities for the men of coming generations is 
bound to be even greater than to-day; but specific training in some 
useful and fundamental. present-day occupation will not only help 
him to find himself, but, when properly taught, will give him an insight 
into social and industrial progress of vital importance to every 
citizen. He will then learn to do something, and at the same time 
get some vision into the intricacies of human society. The civiliza- 
tion or culture of any nation is reflected in its trades and industries. 
Tools, machines, and manufactured products of all sorts represent 
the epitomized struggles of humanity. 
The chief difficulty in vocational training in the schools lies in the 
fact that the variety of work which can be undertaken is limited. 
The only practical escape at this time seems to be through some 
method of cooperation between schools and homes, shops, farms, and 
general business interests. In the future, perhaps, the word “school” 
will connote the organized efforts of the whole community to furnish 
to the children opportunities to learn as well as to do. At any rate, 
there is at present an unmistakable drift in that direction. 
Vocational training implies the acquirement of skill, and in addi- 
tion ought to mean progressive growth in the valuation of labor. 
The future citizen will have to live in a complex civilization, where 
cooperation and interdependence will prevail even to a greater degree 
than at present. 
In recent years a great deal of criticism has been heaped upon the 
schools for their alleged lack of a practical sort of education. Much 
of this criticism has been just; but the most practical thing in life is 
not money getting nor even skill in a trade. The American people 
need to be reminded frequently that along with this educative, 
practical contact with the ordinary duties of life, there is also need

The value of the service this board has rendered is inestimable; 
its influence has been felt in the remotest corners of 11 Southern | 
States. Systematic campaigns have been undertaken in all these 
States, and the doctrines and needs of public education preached to the 
ycommon people, as well as to those who have had better advantages. 
In Mr. G. S. Dickerman’s ‘Review of Five Years of Educational 
s -rogress in the South,” published by the Southern Education Board 
Osteber, 1907, accounts of some of these campaigns are given, and 
they Should be read by all who would appreciate the work of this 
board, as Well as by those who are seeking to understand the causes 
of the great-équcational awakening of the South. In a very decided 
way the Southetm Education Board has understood the needs of the 
South and has helped where help was needed, and has encouraged 
in the most practical manner. 
    VOCATIONAL TRAINING. 
Since the close of the past century the ideals, purposes, and courses 
of study for the public schools have been examined with a thorough- 
ness and discussed with an earnestness commendable in the highest 
degree. As a result there has come about a general demand that 
more time should be given to training in English, nature study, 
manual training, and, especially in the last years of the decade, to 
vocational training. For the boys this has usually taken the form 
of workin wood andiron. Girls have had much variety of work, often 
disconnected and unorganized. From manual training more or less 
like that given to the boys, they have in recent years been turned 
toward those lines of work that every housekeeper ought to know 
and be able to do, such as cooking, sewing, caring for infants, and 
supervising intelligently the outlay for food and clothing for the 
family. This latter movement promises more definite results, and 
offers far more opportunities for real usefulness as well as culture 
than much that was given earlier in the name of manual training. 
One can foretell without appreciable error what, in the main, the life 
work of 90 per cent of the women of the next generation will be. 
Hence it ought to be comparatively easy to work out a course of study 
for girls which will result in definite training for that which is really 
and surely coming. The children of the future will learn their 
mothers’ language, absorb their mothers’ culture, and be largely 
subject to their mothers’ guidance. The future mother will have to 
spend much time and thought on clothing, cooking, washing, and the 
general care of her children, just as mothers do to-day. There will 
be houses to build and furnish; houses to clean and keep clean; 
mending to do; health conditions to consider; plans for entertaining 
friends; and, perhaps more than now, definite and thoughtful con- 
sideration of how to make life worth while on a meager and some-

times irregular income. Surely thoughtful women teachers ought to 
_be able to see in this newer phase of training for girls a great oppor- 
tunity for real culture, as well as specific preparation for housekeeping. 
Meanwhile the work is still chaotic, and needs adjustment and revision. 
The old form of manual training for boys has doubtless served ¢ 
“ useful purposes, but for the most part it has been too indefinite and? 
theoretical. The highly elaborated and logical system of sloyd has 
not taken hold of boy nature in a vital way, because it is based 
exclusively on mere drill work, and too rarely produces a 
worth the endeavor. In some way boys must be allowe 
take real problems if a real lively interest in mafual work is 
desired. It is far more educational for a boy to undertake to make 
a chair and get an imperfect product than it is/to simply practice 
sawing, planing, carving, cutting, and boring. 
The future occupations of boys can not be foretold with the same 
degree of certainty as those for girls. The-variety of opportunities, 
duties, and responsibilities for the men of coming generations is 
bound to be even greater than to-day; but specific training in some 
useful and fundamental .present-day occupation will not only help 
him to find himself, but, when properly taught, will give him an insight 
into social and industrial progress of vital importance to every 
citizen. He will then learn to do something, and at the same time

practical contact with the ordinary duties of life, there is also need 
 
-P-A-G-E-37
  
SURVEY OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS, 1900-1910. 17 
for that inspiration and culture which come from an intimate knowl- 
edge of the ideals, aspirations, and wisdom of the human spirit at its 
best. We need especially to see and understand ‘that unless these 
common duties of life, be they ever so necessary, are utilized and 
made subservient to the real purposes of life, we shall eventually 
miss the mark. It is to be hoped, therefore, that, together with this 
most commendable attempt to teach boys and girls the dignity of 
labor, and train them to do skillfully some of the important duties of 
life, teachers will rise to that higher point of view which will enable 
them to utilize this work for insight, wisdom, and virtue. 
COMPULSORY ATTENDANCE LAWS. 
During this decade perhaps no topic in school legislation has had 
more thoughtful consideration than that of compulsory school 
attendance. Prior to 1900 more than 30 States had laws relating to 
compulsory attendance, but many of these laws were ineffective, and 
most of them were not sufficiently throughgoing in their requirements 
to meet the demands satisfactorily. In general, then, it can be said 
that while comparatively few States had not undertaken the work in 
1900, most of them had yet to learn what they really needed in the 
way of legislation and to make clear the exact purpose and principles 
underlying compulsory attendance laws. During these years, then, 
the progress that has been made is that of development rather than 
initiation. Comparatively few backward steps have been taken, and 
decided advances have been made in many States in the matter of 
lengthening the required annual attendance, and especially in 
requiring specific educational attainments regardless of the time 
element. The age limits formerly set have been extended, and the 
laws have been made more strict with reference to the classes of 
children coming under their provisions. In the beginning of this 
movement, many compulsory attendance laws were almost useless, 
because they did not provide a practicable means for their enforce- 
ment. In recent years these weaknesses have been largely eliminated, 
and in most States compulsory attendance laws are now worthy of 
the name. 
Back of all the details, however, one can see clearly the temper and 
the more or less unconscious educational philosophy of the people. 
They believe not only that every child has the right to opportunity, 
but they believe more specifically than ever before, that the State 
has a definite right to protect itself from the dangers of ignorance. 
The progress of legislation on child labor has had a vital bearing 
on compulsory attendance laws. Practically no legislation has been 
enacted with reference to the regulation of child labor which has not 
had, directly or indirectly, some relation to schooling. To cite two 
illustrations: Georgia enacted in 1908 a law regulating the employ- 
13144°—rp 1911—von 1——2 
 
-P-A-G-E-38

18 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
ment of children in factories and manufacturing establishments, in 
which the following provisions are found: ‘ No child under 14 years 4 
of age shall be employed, unless he or she can write his or her name , 
and simple sentences, and shall have attended school for 12 weeks of the 
preceding year, 6 weeks of which school attendance shall be con- 
secutive;” Idaho in 1907 enacted that ‘‘No minor who is under 16 
years of age shall be employed or permitted to work at any gainful 
occupation during the hours that the public schools of the district 
in which he resides are in session, unless he can read at sight and 
write legibly simple sentences in the English language, and has 
received instruction in spelling, English grammar, and geography, 
and is familiar with the fundamental operations of arithmetic up to 
and including fractions, or has similar attainments in another 
language.” 
Compulsory attendance upon schools was required in 1910 in all 
States in the North. The only States, in fact, which did not have 
compulsory laws were Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Missis- 
sippi, South Carolina, and Texas. 
PENSIONS FOR TEACHERS. 
In 1900 no teacher in the common schools of any State was pen- 
sioned from public school funds. In 1910 Rhode Island and Mary- 
land had laws providing pensions, to be paid under given conditions 
wholly from State funds. In New York teachers in State institu- 
tions are granted pensions, and the laws of New Jersey require local 
authorities to pension teachers who have served 35 years. The Legis- 
lature of Massachusetts has enacted a law requiring the Boston 
school committee to levy a tax for a pension fund, and also another 
allowing all cities and towns other than Boston to provide pension 
funds if, in duly appointed elections, the people in these cities and 
towns so decide. Other States have enacted laws requiring all the 
teachers in cities of a given population to pay a certain per cent 
of their salary into a pension fund. Further details of the most 
recent legislation on the matter of pensions can be found in another 
part of this report. It is enough to say in this connection that 
decided progress has been made in the past 10 years in legislation 
touching the matter of teachers’ pensions, and that the time has come 
when public funds are used for this purpose.   
CONTINUATION SCHOOLS. 
The movement for so-called continuation schools in this country 
has made rapid progress in the past 10 years, although no definite 
standardization has yet been attained; probably that is undesirable 
at this time. The term ‘‘continuation school’ has come to desig-
-P-A-G-E-39
  
SURVEY OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS, 1900-1910. 19 
nate ‘‘any type of school which offers to people while they are at 
work opportunity for further education and training.” Naturally, 
for the most part, they are evening schools, largely composed of 
young men and young women who have discovered the need of some 
general or special training in order to make more satisfactory progress 
in their daily employment. For a careful and extended discussion of 
the continuation schools the reader is referred to Bulletin No. 1, 
1907, prepared for this bureau by Mr. Arthur J. Jones. 
Within the past decade the leading railroad corporations of this 
country have organized and developed a new set of vocational 
schools. True, a beginning had been made before 1900, but the 
schools as they now exist are almost wholly the product of this 
decade. In a bulletin (No. 10, 1909) published by this bureau, Mr. 
J. Shirley Eaton has gone into the matter at length. He also calls 
attention to the various apprenticeship systems used, and to a new 
sort of cooperative educational work between the railroads and 
various high schools and colleges throughout the country. The 
movement as a whole is a most interesting one and is bringing to 
light some striking educational experiments. 
LACK OF PROGRESS IN MUSICAL EDUCATION. 
It is a matter of regret that there is no general forward movement 
in music education to record. Doubtless some advances here and 
there have been made, but as far as can be seen there is no clearly 
marked and definite call from the hearts of the people that their 
children shall be trained in music, or even trained to appreciate it. 
The American people are eye-minded, and moving pictures seem to 
suit their desires better than music. In some way the people should 
be taught to hear the significant things of life, as well as to see them. 
CARE OF DEFECTIVE CHILDREN. 
Progress in the educational care of defectives and delinquents 
is clearly shown by the amount of recent State legislation relating 
thereto, and by the special provisions made in many city systems for 
the better care of these unfortunates. In a very definite way these 
special provisions express the deep humanitarian tendencies of the 
times. The doctrine which lies back of this faith might be set forth 
in some such phrase as this: All defectives and delinquents who can 
profit by education deserve. at public expense that special training 
which will enable them to get more out of life, and to contribute to 
it all that their capabilities will permit. 
MEDICAL INSPECTION OF SCHOOLS. 
Medical inspection of schools did not begin in this country in any 
specific and thoroughgoing way until 1894, and in 1900 there were
-P-A-G-E-40
ee ee ng 
20 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
comparatively few cities or States undertaking such work. In 1910, ‘ 
according to returns published by the Russell Sage Foundation, 
department of child hygiene, there were 400 cities with systems of 
medical inspection. As late as 1905 there were but 55 cities wherein 
medical inspection was regularly undertaken. From these figures 
it can be seen at a glance that this phase of public-school work has 
developed with great rapidity. This rapid advancement has been 
made possible partly by the fact that European countries preceded 
us by many years in this work and we have been able to profit by — 
their experiments and by the systems they evolved. Nevertheless 
many adjustments have been made, and doubtless many changes will 
yet be made before any one plan will serve as a standard. Originally 
the work was undertaken mainly as a means of preventing and con- 
trolling contagious diseases and for the discovery and better care 
of children with defective vision or hearing. It now includes in its 
purview almost all matters pertaining to the physical welfare of child 
life while in school, and has in many places been extended so as to 
take cognizance of home conditions as they affect the health of the 
children. The “school nurse,” dental hygiene, general physical 
| examination of teachers and pupils, and all that pertains to the 
hygiene of instruction and the care of school premises, are now rec- 
ognized parts of this new and highly useful branch of school work. 
In addition, the medical men in this department of the public-school. 
service are influencing in many ways the teaching of general hygiene 
in the school curriculum. 
Sound health is vital to any community as well as to the nation, 
and our people have not been slow to recognize the great value of this 
service. Every good citizen who studies the movement will rejoice 
in the great progress made, and will hope for and confidently expect a 
wider and fuller development in the immediate future.. The urgent 
need now is to extend it so as to include the country children in its 
scope. J 
PROGRESS IN SANITATION. 
During the decade there has been marked improvement in the 
demand of the more informed classes for better sanitation in the 
cities and towns, and, to some extent, in the country. There is a 
general disposition now developing to connect good citizenship with 
cleanliness and sanitation. This movement toward better health 
conditions is manifested in the adjustment, to this end, of the courses 
offered in high schools and colleges in biology, chemistry, and hy- 
giene. The general subject of school hygiene and sanitation is 
demanding more attention, and the work in physiology in the elemen- 
tary schools is including more information and training in matters 
pertaining to personal and community health. This comparatively 
new emphasis on sanitation has grown directly out of the wonderful 
 
-P-A-G-E-41
RE ee Te Oe ee Re ee ee <6 
SURVEY OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS, 1900-1910. 21 
advances that have been made in the last quarter of a century in 
bacteriology and medical science. In the schools these new points 
of view are expressing themselves in the demand for larger play- 
grounds, better methods of heating and ventilation, the disuse of the 
common. drinking cup, medical inspection, dental hygiene, and many 
other matters relating to the health of school children. Practically 
all the States have passed laws on these and kindred subjects, and 
the outlook for the immediate future is encouraging. 
What might be called a national crusade against the house fly and 
the mosquito has grown out of the results of investigations connecting 
these pests with the spread of typhoid fever and malaria. The news- 
papers of the country have done helpful service in aiding in this move- 
ment, for they have used their columns freely to create a widespread 
public sentiment in favor of better rural and municipal sanitation. 
The Rockefeller Sanitary Commission for the Eradication of Hook- 
worm Disease came into existence during the decade, and it is now 
engaged in teaching the people the necessary sanitary measures for 
preventing this disease as well as the proper therapeutic measures 
for those who are already infected. i 
In 1907 Mrs. Russell Sage gave the sum of $10,000,000 to a board 
of trustees who are to use the income to “eradicate so far as possible 
the causes of poverty and ignorance.’ The department of child 
hygiene of this foundation has shown unusual energy and has pub- 
lished many bulletins and books bearing on vital questions of health 
and sanitation. As a result, the quickening interest in playgrounds, 
open-air schools, and medical inspection has been fostered and the 
results of many valuable investigations have been published. 
This general awakening for better sanitation is not limited to our 
country, but it is clearly a world movement, and will ultimately issue 
in relieving humanity from much suffering, poverty, and vice. An 
education which does not teach children, as well as adults, the real 
significance of good health, and some of the most fundamental laws 
of personal and community hygiene, is faulty and meretricious. 
EDUCATION OF NEGROES. 
Before calling attention to the figures relating to the education 
of the negroes, it is only fair to say that the statistical material on 
negro education, which the bureau has been able to secure, is far 
from complete and therefore not accurate. There are many oppor- 
tunities and occasions for errors in the returns furnished to the 
various State superintendents, and there are no common standards 
among the States for gathering and classifying the returns. How- 
ever, it appears from the figures furnished that in 1900 there were 
in average attendance in the public elementary schools of 16 Southern 
States and the District of Columbia 957,160 negro children. For
-P-A-G-E-42
ee ee ee 
22 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
their instruction, 27,182 teachers were employed. In 1910 there 
were 1,116,811 in average daily attendance, with a corps of 30,334 4 
teachers. This is an increase of a little over 16 per cent in the 
number in attendance, and slightly over 11 per cent in the number 
of teachers employed. 
In the 92 public high schools for negroes in 1900 there were 5,232 
, students who were classified as pursuing secondary subjects. The 
corresponding figures for the 141 high schools in 1910 show 8,251 
| students of high-school grade, an increase of over 57 per cent. ‘The 
total number of teachers for these schools had increased from 272 
in 1900 to 473 in 1910, or more than 73 per cent. 
In addition to the students who are classified as doing regular 
high-school work, there were in these so-called high schools, in 
1900, pupils classified as elementary students to the number of 
3,216; in 1910 the number of this same grade of students was only 
2,684. This decrease in the amount of elementary work done in high 
schools suggests that at present the public high schools for negroes 
are of a higher grade than were those at the beginning of the century. 
The increased expenditure for public secondary education for 
negroes can not be accurately estimated because of the fact that the 
expense accounts for those doing real high-school work and those 
who have actually been doing elementary work have not been kept 
separate. In addition, several States have been unable to furnish 
the returns desired. 
In general, there has been marked progress in public high schools 
for negroes, especially in Texas, Missouri, Georgia, Mississippi, and 
Florida. In 1910 Texas reported 36 high schools for the negroes; 
Missouri, 21; Georgia, 11; Mississippi, 8. 
Up to this time, however, the major part of the higher training for 
negroes has been given in private academies, institutes, and colleges, 
and these are of all grades of worth. In 1900, according to returns 
furnished this bureau, there were 145 such schools. In 1910, 189 
were reported. Nearly all of them have elementary, secondary, and 
collegiate work, and are supported and directed very largely by 
religious denominations and charitable organizations. 
In these private schools in 1900 there were enrolled a total of 
37,696 students; of these 20,348 were females and 17,348 were males. 
More than half of the students were in the elementary grades. The 
total number reported as doing secondary work was 13,267. The 
total number of teachers employed was 1,826. For the year 1910, 
in 189 schools of the same general type, 57,915 students were enrolled; 
25,730 males, 32,186 females. Of: these, 19,654 were listed as 
students of secondary grade. The total number of teachers 
employed was 2,941. These figures show an increase in secondary 
students in private schools during the 10 years of a little over 
 
-P-A-G-E-43
  SURVEY OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS, 1900-1910. 23 
48 per cent, and in the whole number enrolled, regardless of their 
classification, as above 53 per cent. 
This comparison brings to light two facts: (a) The number of 
the negroes receiving secondary and higher training in private 
schools is much larger than that in public schools; (6) relatively 
speaking, the percentage of growth for public high schools for negroes 
for the decade appears to be slightly in excess of that for private 
schools maintained for the same purpose. 
_ In an elaborate and very interesting volume entitled “An Era of 
Progress and Promise,” edited by Mr. W. N. Hartshorn, and pub- 
lished by the Priscilla Publishing Co., Boston, 1910, there is the 
most specific account heretofore published of the Religious, Moral, 
and Educational Development of the American Negro since His 
Emancipation (1863-1910). 
From lists of 259 private educational institutions for negroes, 
printed in this volume, the following facts have been gleaned: In 
1908 the total number of students in these institutions was 76,169. 
These schools are operated and controlled by various religious 
denominations, societies, and independent boards. During the 
decade from 1900 to 1910, the number of schools as listed increased. 
from 218 to 259. In detailed statements concerning 120 of these 
schools under control of churches, it is learned that the total number 
of students for 1908 was 41,752, teachers 1,633, and that the annual 
expense incurred amounted to $1,388,041. 
The character of educational work for negroes has changed very 
materially since the beginning of the century, and teachers and 
preachers alike are emphasizing the need of vocational training as 
the most important means for the uplift of this people. Booker T. 
Washington has, without doubt, been the most forceful apostle of 
this new education for his people, and, despite much protest from 
some of the educators of his race, he has preached the doctrine of 
regeneration through thrift, better farms, better homes, and better 
sanitation, as well as through the ordinary educational means. 
INDIAN EDUCATION. 
Within the past 10 years it appears that the educational care of 
Indian children has received especial attention along the following 
- lines: The boys have had better and longer training in industrial 
work, including agriculture, stock raising, carpentry, etc., while the 
girls have had more help in all that pertains to homekeeping, such as 
cooking, sewing, nursing, and sanitation. 
In a manual, prepared in 1910 for the Indian schools, by Hon. 
R. G. Valentine, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, it is declared 
that ‘‘We are maintaining a great system of schools for the Indians, 
which in a sense enrolls the entire race. * * * Our Indian 
 
-P-A-G-E-44
  24 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
population extends into 26 States of the Union, and in a few genera- 
tions at least it will have been largely fused with the citizenship 
of these great Commonwealths.” It is, therefore, the avowed inten- 
tion of those who have charge of this branch of educational work ‘to 
make the course of study for each Indian school conform to the 
course of study adopted by the State or county in which it is sit- 
uated.” This plan is designed to put the various Indian schools, 
particularly the day schools, in condition for future absorption 
into the State school systems, because of having the same course of 
study and to a considerable extent the same series of textbooks. 
The teachers and supervisors, however, are warned that ‘the adop- 
tion of the State courses of study by Indian schools must not be used 
as an excuse for the inclusion in the work of the school of anything 
that is not of recognized value to Indian pupils. The welfare of 
the pupils must be kept constantly in mind, and a slavish adherence 
to State courses would be almost as objectionable as would be the 
neglect to adhere to any course.” 
In his Annual Report to the Secretary of the Interior, for the year 
ending June 30, 1910, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs calls 
attention to the following improvements in the administration 
and supervision of Indian schools: (2) An adequate system of 
supervision has been provided, by dividing the whole territory 
involved into six districts, with a supervisor in charge of each district. 
(6) A chief supervisor has been appointed to have general direction 
of all the supervisors. (c) Plans are being formulated to follow up 
pupils after they leave school, in order to render them additional 
service, by helping them to overcome the temptation to drop back 
into the unprogressive customs and practices of the various tribes 
to which they belong. The essential features of this plan are— 
that the pupil, when he leaves the reservation, shall carry a letter from the superin- 
tendent to the superintendent of the nonreservation school, acquainting the latter 
with the essential facts in the life of the pupil, and indicating to him the conditions 
on the reservation to which he will return. * * * When a pupil leaves school 
he will carry a letter to the superintendent of the reservation to which he returns, 
with directions that it be presented immediately upon his arrival. This will give 
the home superintendent a splendid opportunity to gather from the pupil an idea 
of his plans and prospects and to give the pupil wholesome advice. It will open 
the way to him to keep a fatherly eye on the boy until he gets well on his feet. 
@ The health conditions are being more carefully guarded than . 
heretofore. The principal features of this work consist in— 
(1) An intensive attack upon the two diseases that most seriously menace the health 
of the Indians—trachoma and tuberculosis. (2) Preventive work on a large scale, 
by means of popular education along health lines and more effective sanitary inspec-

so that the physical stamina of the coming generation may be conserved and increased.

SURVEY OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS, 1900-1910, 25 
PROGRESS OF EDUCATION IN HAWAII. 
It appears. from the Report of the Superintendent of Public 
Instruction of the Territory of Hawaii, made to the governor for 
the two years ending December 31, 1900, that the total appropria- 
tions for all public-school purposes during these years amounted 
to $738,058.41. Of this total, the sum of $19,720.09 was used for 
the erection of new school buildings and cottages for teachers. For 
the biennial period ending December 31, 1910, the appropriation 
for all purposes amounted to $876,440. The cost per capita of 
public-school education was not materially changed during the 
decade, but advancements were made, especially in the work of 
supervision, medical inspection, industrial training, and better 
school buildings. 
One of the most interesting and suggestive features of the school 
statistics of Hawaii is that relating to the changes in nationality of 
the pupils in the past 10 years. The accompanying table is adapted 
from the Report of the Superintendent of Public Instruction for 
the two years ending December 31, 1910, and deserves thoughtful 
consideration.

Hawaii for the years 1900-1910.

From this table it will be readily seen that the number of Hawaiian 
children attending schools is gradually decreasing, and the number 
of children “Part Hawaiian” increasing. But the most striking 
change is seen in the rapid increase of the numbers of Japanese and 
Portuguese children. In 1900 there were 1,352 Japanese children 
in school; in 1910 there were 7,262, or an increase in the 10 years 
of more than 437 per cent. It will be observed that during the decade 
two other nationalities make their appearance in this medley of 
school population, viz, Korean and Porto Rican, while apparently 
Scandinavia ceases to be represented. By comparing the figures in 
the table heré given with those relating to public and private school 
attendance it will be seen that the growth in public-school attend- 
   
-P-A-G-E-46
  ee ee ee 
26 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
ance has been confined very largely to children of Asiatic or Por- 
tuguese parentage. In 1900 slightly over 38: per cent of the total 
number of children in the public schools were of these nationalities, 
but in 1910 they represented more than 61 per cent of the public- 
school enrollment. Meanwhile the children of American, British, 
and German parentage are turning more and more to private schools, 
for it must be that in a school where most of the children know the j 
English language imperfectly, an English-speaking child will not be 
able to get sufficient attention to make proper progress in his studies. 
Furthermore, it appears from the figures given in 1910 that only a 
little over 14 per cent of all public-school pupils were classified above 
the fourth grade, and more than half were not beyond the third 
grade. The numbers in attendance upon the high schools and 
normal school, included in the total of public-school pupils, were 
254 and 136, respectively. 
Changes of vital moment have taken place in the nationality of 
the teaching force. In 1900 out of 352 teachers in the public schools 
175 were Americans. In 1910 out of 501 teachers, only 168 were 
Americans. The accessions to the numbers of public-school teachers 
in the 10 years have come almost wholly from the Hawaiian and 
Part Hawaiian. There was a slight increase in the number of 
Portuguese and Chinese employed. This change in the personnel 
of the teaching staff is bound to have a marked influence on the 
educational work of the islands. 
PUBLIC EDUCATION IN PORTO RICO. 
For the year 1900, the year succeeding the American occupation, 
the total enrollment in the public schools of Porto Rico was 24,392. 
Ten years later the number had increased to 121,453, or at the rate 
of nearly 400 per cent. The average daily attendance during the 
same time had risen from 20,103 to 84,258 or at the rate of approxi- 
mately 300 per cent. In 1900 there were 632 teachers in public- 
school work. In 1910 there were 1,692. The total annual cost for 
schooling per pupil in average daily attendance amounted in 1900 
to $18.50; in 1910 to $14.01. 
In addition to the rapid development in the teaching of agricul- 
ture, domestic arts, English language, and the various fundamental 
subjects in Porto Rico, there has developed a most interesting 
system of scholarships open to all who show marked proficiency in 
their studies. It is now possible for a bright pupil “in the remotest 
barrio within the island to be carried through to graduation at the 
best university in the United States entirely as a Government 
scholarship student.” This system is in force in such a way as to 
encourage the students and to afford the authorities opportunity 
to select young people for further work in preparation for teaching,
-P-A-G-E-47
Fe er eee 
SURVEY OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS, 1900-1910. 27 
for agriculturists, and special workers in general. At another place 
in this report there will be found a detailed report from the com- 
missioner of schools, Dr. E. G. Dexter. It is enough to say here 
that the people of this island have taken a lively interest in the 
development of the public schools, and that practically most that 
now exists in the way of educational effort and opportunity has 
come since 1899, the year of American occupation. 
DEVELOPMENT OF EDUCATION IN THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS, 
The development of the educational system of the Philippine 
Islands since the American occupation has attracted world-wide 
attention. When a shipload of American teachers sailed from San 
Francisco in 1901 in response to a call for help, a new sort of con- 
quest was instituted. Many of the islands were then little known and 
their inhabitants were of many races and many tongues. Some 
parts were occupied by people of culture, while others were inhabited 
by half civilized and warlike peoples. The attempt from the first 
was not to force upon them American ideals of life and culture, but 
to use teachers from the States to start the work of education, and to 
prepare native teachers as rapidly as possible to take their places. 
The first large question to settle was to determine the language to 
be used in the schools. The English language was selected, for the 
reason that there was no common language spoken or written by any 
large portion of the people. This necessitated school books in Eng- 
lish adapted to the conditions there found, and to the content in the 
children’s minds. 
Under these and many other difficulties the educational work in 
these islands has made striking progress. In 1910 the total number 
of schools was 4,531, with 9,007 teachers and apprentices. The 
enrollment for September of this last year of the decade amounted to 
587,317, and the average monthly attendance to 337,307. As 
rapidly as consistent with progress and justice to the children, the 
relative number of American teachers has been reduced, until at this 
time less than 10 per cent of the teachers employed are from the 
States. It is almost beyond credence to assert that such a variety 
of school children, comprising such striking differences in capacity 
and customs, should be brought to use, even meagerly, a complicated 
foreign language as the medium of education within a decade. But 
such has been the case, and the experiment has apparently been 
fully justified. It may not be amiss to call attention to the fact that 
no such gigantic experiment in the teaching of a foreign language was 
ever undertaken before. Surely the methods employed and the 
results attained deserve the most careful consideration. Some com- 
petent American teacher who has been in the thick of it all ought to 
 
-P-A-G-E-48
  28 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
organize and describe the methods and means through which such 
results have been achieved. 
When American occupation began there were few schools and 
fewer competent teachers. The work given was more or less unre- 
lated to the lives. of the pupils and the opportunities before them. 
A little over 10 years later we find on the whole a better system of 
vocational training for the elementary schools than can be found any- 
where in the States. 
It is often instructive to note what can be done in a short time 
when those who know what is better are given a free hand. Through 
the guidance and leadership of the normal school and the various 
agencies for setting standards and training leaders, not only are 
many of the Filipino children able to read, write, and speak the 
English language with some degree of ‘fluency after three years of 
schooling, but they are now rapidly acquiring vocational skill in 
many lines of work which in time will be a large asset to their people. 
The boys are being trained in hat making, carpentry, blacksmithing, 
agriculture, gardening, and various other crafts. The girls are learn- 
ing cookery, lace making, embroidery, drawn work, dressmaking, 
plain sewing, the care of children, especially of infants, and house- 
hold economics and hygiene in general. Those who have instructed 
the Filipino girls report that in lace making and embroidery they 
show great talent. It is asserted by Director White that “because 
of their natural aptitude for this sort of work, their patience, and 
delicacy of execution, the Filipino women are considered among the 
most skillful workers in the world in these arts, their products being 
classed by experts as even superior to those of the French and the 
Swiss.”” Doubtless with the help of modern methods, patterns, and 
appliances, this work will afford much relief to those women who under 
other circumstances would have little opportunity for earning an 
income. 
Commendable progress has been made in the construction of 
schoolhouses. While, at the close of the decade, there is yet far from 
a sufficient number of passable buildings for school purposes, at the 
beginning the work was greatly hindered by lack of such facilities. 
The better buildings now being constructed, if one may judge from 
photographs and floor plans, seem to be particularly well adapted 
both in architectural features and construction to the climatic and 
educational conditions to be found in the islands. From the report 
of the director of education for 1910, it is learned that the total cost 
of “school building projects pending” amounted to approximately 
$450,000. 
The most hopeful school work now in progress is without doubt 
that in industrial and vocational lines, On this point a further quota-
-P-A-G-E-49
  SURVEY OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS, 1900-1910. 29 
  tion from the director’s report for 1910 is worthy of consideration. 
He says, in regard to the development of industrial training: 
The opportunity presented for future development is enormous. Other countries 
with educational systems long established on orthodox lines encounter almost insur- 
mountable difficulties in the reorganizing of those systems upon a practical basis. 
In the Philippines the organization is still in its formative period. The administra- 
tion of the bureau is hampered by no embarrassing precedents; it has reasonably 
ample funds with which to execute its plans; and, best of all, it has in a most gratify- 
ing measure the moral support of both Americans and Filipinos in its attempt to build 
up here a system of instruction which will promote the industrial efficiency and 
material well-being of this population. Such another opportunity probably never 
existed anywhere. It is perhaps not going too far to venture the assertion at this 
time that, within two or three years from this date, no State or national government 
will have in practical operation a system of industrial instruction more consistent than 
that of the Philippines in its sequence through the various grades, or more closely 
adapted to the material conditions and requirements of the country. 
EDUCATIONAL FOUNDATIONS. 
It is certainly well within the truth to say that no decade in the 
world’s history has such a wonderful story to tell with reference to 
educational foundations as that which has just passed. Within 10 
years approximately $100,000,000 has been given from private for- 
tunes for general educational endowments in the country at large. 
Best of all, each of these gifts has been given in a large-minded way, 
so that the various boards of control have much freedom and discre- 
tionary power in administering the funds and in organizing the work 
under their control. A brief account of each of these foundations 
follows: THE CARNEGIE INSTITUTION. 
In January, 1902, Mr. Andrew Carnegie gave to a board of trustees 
the sum of $10,000,000 in registered bonds bearing annual interest 
at the rate of 5 per cent. In 1907 he added $2,000,000, and, if the 
decade may be overstepped a few days, in January, 1911. he increased 
the total endowment to $22,000,000. 
The purpose of the donor was to ‘found in the city of Washington 
an institution which, with the cooperation of institutions now or 
hereafter established, there or elsewhere, shall in the broadest and 
most liberal manner encourage investigation, research, and dis- 
covery—show the application of knowledge to the improvement of 
mankind, and provide such buildings, laboratories, books, and appa- 
ratus as may be needed.” The institution was incorporated by act 
of Congress April 28, 1904, and it is now known as the Carnegie Insti- 
tution of Washington. The executive officers are Robert S. Wood- 
ward, president; Cleveland H. Dodge, secretary. The administra- 
tion offices are now in the new building known in Washington as the 
Carnegie Institution, located at Sixteenth and P Streets NW.
-P-A-G-E-50
  30 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
The lines of work undertaken thus far may be grouped under the 
following general headings: 
1. Cooperative research in various lines requiring long periods of 
time and organized efforts. 
2. Individual research in various lines by trained investigators. 
3. Investigations carried on chiefly by those who give promise of 
scientific leadership. 
4. Publication of the results of research work, in all lines, and of 
other scientific and useful matter not generally accessible. 
THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD. 
The General Education Board was organized in New York, Feb- 
ruary 27, 1902, and incorporated by act of Congress, signed January 
12, 1903. The charter of this board, amongst other provisions, sets 
forth the following: 
This corporation shall have power to build, improve, enlarge, or equip buildings for 
elementary or primary schools, industrial schools, technical schools, normal schools, 
training schools for teachers, or schools of any grade, or for higher institutions of 
learning, or, in connection therewith, libraries, workshops, gardens, kitchens, or other 
educational accessories; to establish, maintain, or endow elementary or primary 
schools, industrial schools, technical schools, normal schools, training schools for 
teachers, or schools of any grade, or higher institutions of learning; to employ or aid 
others to employ teachers and lecturers; to aid, cooperate with or endow associations 
or other corporations engaged in educational work within the United States of 
America, or to donate to any such association or corporation any property or moneys 
which shall at any time be held by the said corporation hereby constituted; to collect 
educational statistics and information, and to publish and distribute documents and 
reports containing the same; and in general to do and perform all things necessary or 
convenient for the promotion of the object of the corporation. 
This board has now as endowment the sum of more than.$30,000,000, 
a gift from Mr. John D. Rockefeller, and holds in trust the sum of 
$22,000,000, also given by Mr. Rockefeller. The income from the 
permanent endowment amounts to about $1,500,000 annually, and is 
disbursed by the board in accordance with the provisions of its charter. 
The principal and the income from the trust fund of $22,000,000 are 
subject to the direction of Mr. Rockefeller or his son, Mr. John D. 
Rockefeller, jr. 
The official staff of this corporation consists of “not less than 9 
nor more than 17’’ board members, whose term of office is three 
years. Vacancies in the board are filled by the board, and mem- 
bers are eligible for reelection. 
The board has devoted itself in the Northern States wholly to the 
promotion of higher education. In the South, in addition to assisting 
various colleges to larger endowments, it has been of very great service 
by supporting professors of secondary education in the State univer- 
sities, and through them helping to encourage and organize the public
-P-A-G-E-51
    SURVEY OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS, 1900-1910, 31 
high schools of the Southern States. It has also used its funds and 
its influence in stimulating the South to a larger and more vital 
interest in the general problems of public education. 
THE CARNEGIE FOUNDATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF TEACHING. 
On April 16, 1905, Mr. Andrew Carnegie addressed a letter to 25 
men whom he had selected as trustees setting forth his wishes and 
plans. <A part of this letter reads as follows: 
GenTLEMEN: I have reached the conclusion that the least rewarded of all profes- 
sions is that of the teacher in our higher educational institutions. New York City, 
generously and very wisely, provides retiring pensions for teachers in our -public 
schools, and also for our policemen. Very few, indeed, of our colleges are able to do so. 
The consequences are grievous. Able men hesitate to adopt teaching as a career, 
and many old professors whose places should be occupied by younger men can not be 
retired. 
I have transferred to you and your successors as trustees $10,000,000, the revenue 
from which is to provide retiring pensions for the teachers of universities, colleges, 
and technical schools in our country, Canada, and Newfoundland, under such condi- 
tions as you may adopt from time to time. 
The fund applies to the three classes of institutions named, without regard to race, 
sex, creed, orcolor. * * * . 
While the letter further on excluded State universities from par- 
ticipation in this fund, in 1908 they were granted this privilege, and 
the original sum was increased to $15,000,000. 
This foundation, was incorporated March 10, 1906, under the name 
of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. The 
present executive officers are Dr. Henry S. Pritchett, president; 
Clyde Furst, secretary. 
THE RUSSELL SAGE FOUNDATION, 
The Russell Sage Foundation was incorporated in New York in 
April, 1907, and has an endowment of $10,000,000, given by Mrs. 
Russell Sage. The charter provides that— 
It shall be within the purpose of said corporation to use any means which from time 
to time shall seem expedient to its members or trustees, including research, publica- 
tion, education, the establishment and maintenance of charitable and benevolent 
activities, agencies, and institutions, and the aid of any such activities, agencies, or 
institutions already established. 
In a letter, shortly after the incorporation of the foundation, Mrs. 
Sage stated that— 
The scope of the foundation is not only national, but itis broad. Itshould, however, 
preferably not undertake to do that which is now being done or is likely tobe effect- 
ively done by other individuals or other agencies. It should be its aim to take up 
the larger, more difficult problems; and to take them up so far as possible in such a 
manner as to secure cooperation and aid in their solution. 
There are nine trustees of this foundation, with headquarters in 
New York City. The officials of the board are Mrs. Russell Sage,
-P-A-G-E-52
32 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
president; Robert W. DeForest, vice president; Cleveland H. Dodge, 
treasurer; and John M. Glenn, secretary and general director. 
THE JEANES FUND. 
On. April 23, 1907, Miss Anna T. Jeanes, of Philadelphia, gave 
$1,000,000 to aid in securing better rural schools for the negroes. A 
board of trustees was appointed to carry out the provisions of this 
foundation, and organized February, 1908. The executive officers 
of this board are: Dr. James H. Dillard, president, New Orleans, La.; 
George Foster Peabody, treasurer, New York City; Maj. Robert R. 
Moton, secretary, Hampton Institute, Va. 
The expressed purpose of this board is the uplift of the negroes by 
the development of better rural schools. Thus far the work has been 
unusually successful. The board have set themselves to the task of 
organizing these people for self-help in all that pertains to country 
school and farm life. 
Three plans have been outlined for this work, and these are now 
being carried out in what appears to be a most helpful and practical 
manner: Peete 
1. A teacher has been assigned to a county for the purpose of 
visiting and supervising all the schools in that county. In addition 
she has been directed to introduce simple forms of manual training, 
and to interest the people in better schoolhouses and school grounds. 
This is generally known as the Henrico plan, because it was first 
developed in Henrico County, Va. 
2. The employment of a teacher to do extension work among a 
number of schools within easy reach of some central school as head- 
quarters. This plan gives closer supervision and more immediate 
help to the regular teachers. 
3. The third plan has been to put a man into a county and set him 
to the work of creating a more intelligent public sentiment for the 
betterment of rural schools and country life in general. He is 
expected also to supervise the teachers and organize them for self- 
improvement. 
OTHER EDUCATIONAL BENEFACTIONS. 
In addition to the gifts which have made these great foundations 
possible, a great many cheerful givers have poured out their wealth 
to the colleges, universities, and technical schools already established. 
It is impossible to state with accuracy the total amount of general 
benefactions to these schools in the 10 years, for doubtless many gifts 
have been made which have not been reported and some have been 
reported which for one reason or another miscarried. But, accord- 
ing to the returns furnished this office, there has been a total of 
$179,871,644 given for higher education. This does not’ generally 
 
-P-A-G-E-53
  es 
SURVEY OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS, 1900-1910. 33 
include gifts for law schools, medical schools, theological schools, 
dental schools, and schools for nurses. The amount of gifts for these 
latter institutions has been large. It will therefore be very near to 
the truth to say that approximately $200,000,000 have been given to 
higher and professional educational institutions during the decade. 
This enormous sum, coupled with the amounts given for the founda- 
tions above noted, marks the decade as the foremost in the history of 
the nation, perhaps in all history, with reference to educational bene- 
factions. 
THE CECIL RHODES SCHOLARSHIPS. 
One of the most unique and at the same time one of the most 
inspiring attempts to cultivate a bond of union between widely 
separated peoples of different nationalities is that conceived by the 
late Cecil Rhodes, and which is being carried out by the provisions 
of his will. It was a great and original conception, in that it proposed 
a racial patriotism broader than national boundaries, and interna- 
tional fellowships based on culture and the social contact of a selected 
body of young men. Mr. Rhodes died in 1902 and left the sum of 
£2,000,000 to a board of trustees, directing them to use the income 
from this princely sum for scholarships at Oxford University. These 
scholars are appointed—under conditions named or authorized— 
from the colonial dependencies of England, from the United States 
(2 from each State or Territory), and 15 from Germany, or of German 
birth, to be nominated by the Emperor. All of the scholarships, 
except those from Germany, have an annual value of £300. Those 
for the German students amount to £250 annually. Each scholar- 
ship is for a term of three years. 
The first American Rhodes scholars were appointed in 1904, and 
up to 1910, 178 young m ‘rom the United States have enjoyed 
through this benefaction the privileges of this great university. 
Dr. Parkin, the organizing representative of the Rhodes Scholarship 
Trust, in an article on ‘‘ American Rhodes scholars at Oxford,” in the 
North American Review for June, 1909, says: 
Starting with a profound belief in the high destiny and beneficent influence of the 
British Empire, and eagerly desirous to promote the permanent unity of its various 
parts, while increasing their strength and usefulness, his first intention as a means to 
this end was to bring the youthful vigor of the colonies into touch with the experience 
and culture of the Mother Land, in the belief that both would thereby be benefited. 
As time went on, his advancing thought led him to conceive that still higher ends could 
be served by the cooperation of the United States with his own country in carrying 
forward the work of civilization, and still further that the increasing influence of 
Germany madeitssupport and sympathy for thesame purpose of the utmost importance. 
He believed that great good would result to the world from a mutual understanding 
between these various peoples, and using the means which he had in hishand he took the 
step that seemed to him most likely to promote such an understanding. His plan was 
very simple. He would secure as the agents of his purpose picked young men of these

nations. For these he believed that the strongest bond of sympathy would be created 
by a common education. He therefore arranged that, for all time to come, nearly 200 
scholars of these countries should be educated together at the most ancient and famous 
seat of English learning and training. 
WORLD MOVEMENTS IN EDUCATION. 
It may not be out of place in this general and incomplete survey of 
progress to call attention to certain world movements in education. 
These have developed in part as a result of international conferences, 
visiting commissions, interchange of students, and, above all, of the 
world-wide distribution of printed matter bearing on all phases of 
educational administration and policy. Each progressive nation is 
eagerly learning from the others, and the gain made by one is taken 
up and adapted by the others. Naturally the relative emphasis 
which each of these movements will receive in any country will 
depend on local traditions and customs. 
(1) Public education for all, at public expense, is a goal toward 
which the whole civilized world is more or less unconsciously advanc- 
ing. Some occupy an advanced position in this regard, while others 
are struggling far in the rear., But everywhere there seems to be a 
growth in this direction. The argument for public education gains 
strength in proportion to the growth of public respect for human life 
and the human spirit. Poverty and parental neglect ought not to 
offer absolute impedimenta to the progress of the children of any 
nation. But there is much yet to do to break down that selfishness 
which has condemned the less fortunate children of many nations to 
an unfair chance. Compulsory education for the sake of both the 
child and the State is relatively speaking a new phase of this move- 
ment. But it is a most significant phase. 
(2) Closely associated with the growing consciousness that children 
have a right to an education is the related idea that they deserve 
good care from parents, teachers, and the public in general. The 
world over, the child-welfare movement is gaining ground. Naturally 
it exhibits itself in various ways and with varying emphasis in different 
countries. The more enlightened and humane nations are demanding 
more and more sweeping restrictions on the rights of parents or others 
who force young children to a life of labor, and take from them that 
opportunity and longing for play which their natures crave and their 
education demands. Charles Dickens made an effective appeal in 
the early part of the last century, in an emotional way, and now a 
more careful study of child nature is enforcing in a rational manner 
the essential needs of children. There is still much to learn and more 
to do before the children will be treated according to their deserts, 
and in line with the life they should lead. But the situation is hope- 
ful, and the world-wide interest in playgrounds, child study, juvenile 
courts, medical supervision, and child hygiene will eventually issue 
in better treatment of children in the home and at school.

(3) The spirit of science is now at work in the world in a more 
effective fashion than at any other time in human history. Tra- 
ditional ways of thinking and doing are no longer piously reserved 
from the scrutinizing inquiry of the truth seeker, and while the 
“unanimity of the wise” is still in the distant future, honest inquiry 
is its necessary forerunner. Earnest investigators, everywhere, 
are known to each other, and in their search there exist no national 
boundaries and no insuperable barriers to common understandings 
and mutual assistance. The education of the last century kindled 
this spirit, and the coming century will reap its rewards. 
(4) Vocational training, ‘much discussed at present, is essentially 
the product of a few decades. But the purposes and intent of the 
movement have entered into the educational consciousness of the 
world with a rapidity unlike that of any subject of recent years. 
True, the work is still inchoate and more or less indefinite, but it 
appears as a promise and foretokens the accomplishment of a long- 
felt need. Word comes from China, Japan, Egypt, Australia, the 
Philippine Archipelago, Iceland, all of Europe, and the western world 
that it is time to teach the children to make some specific preparation 
for the world’s work, in addition to teaching them the essentials of 
the older curricula. Whether this movement will fulfill its promises 
will depend on wise understanding and sane, steady a\ .ninistration. 
Meanwhile the call for help comes from all directions, and the willing- 
ness to learn from all is the spirit of all. 
The movement for promoting agricultural education is peculiarly 
pronounced and widespread at this time. In Japan, India—espe- 
cially in British India and those native States tributary to the 
British Government—Egypt, South Africa, England, Ireland, Canada, 
Netherlands-India, and some of the South American Republics, and 
in our country a new emphasis is being given to instruction in agri- 
cultural subjects. How far this work will operate to modify the 
older curricula, or to influence general economic and social conditions, 
can not be foretold. But surely good will come, and the purposes of 
education will be broadened, and, let us hope, deepened. 
(5) The movement for the education of women has not only made 
great progress in European countries but is recognized in Japan and 
in awakening China as indispensable to national progress. This 
movement shows some remarkable features in India. In the Indian 
National Congress, which gives free opportunity for the expression 
of native opinion, leaders from different communities and States of 
India have been specially pronounced in their conviction of the 
importance of making large provision for the education of women 
and the breaking down of their traditional seclusion. It is a most 
hopeful sign to find everywhere that the rights of women in matters 
educational and social are being recognized, for surely this means 
accelerated progress for the coming years.

    CHAPTER II. 
HIGHER EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES. 
By Kernpric CHARLES Bascock, 
Chief of the Division of Higher Education, Bureau of Education. 
HIGHER EDUCATIONAL TENDENCIES. 
Any discussion of recent movements in the realm of higher educa- 
tion in contrast to developments of earlier periods must take cogni- 
zance of several strong tendencies which have become more and more 
clearly marked. Especially notable in the last 10 years are the fol- 
lowing: A great expansion of the functions of colleges and universi- 
ties; a marked elevation of standards, especially of graduate and pro- 
fessional instruction; a great improvement in the business organiza- 
tion of both public and private institutions; a completer cooperation 
of agencies for promoting higher educational interests; an unprece- 
dented drafting of university experts into State and National service; 
and a thoroughgoing investigation and discussion of standards and 
methods of instruction and administration. Reorganization and 
wider service on the part of various institutions, rather than the 
establishment of new educational institutions, have marked the recent 
era. Unwarranted ambitions and pretentions of certain universities 
have been outgrown and weak departments discontinued. Here and 
there a “university ” has voluntarily changed its name to college, and 
a “college” has become an academy. 
Abundant frank, perhaps savage, criticism of colleges and uni- 
versities has been widespread. The public, leaders of great indus- 
tries, secondary school men, alumni, members of faculties, and presi- 
dents themselves have participated in this criticism with varying de- 
grees of knowledge, prejudice, passion, and dogmatism. The faults 
charged to higher education—ineffectiveness, traditionalism, waste- 
fulness, snobbery, irreverence and agnosticism, and the unfitting of 
men for really useful lives—have found expression in the strident 
voices of the native-born; they have crept into newspaper headlines; 
they have made spicy articles for popular as well as educational 
magazines. 
But there is nothing very new in note or in motive in all this com- 
plaint and criticism. A century and a half ago, William Smith, who 
37 
   
-P-A-G-E-58
    38 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
later became provost of an academy which was the forerunner of 
the University of Pennsylvania, thus-criticized contemporary col- 
leges: 
The first [class of the whole body of people] consists of those designed for 
the learned professions; by which they understand divinity, law, physic, and 
the chief offices of the State. The second class consists of those designed for 
the mechanic professions, and all the remaining people of the country. 
Such a division is absolutely necessary; for, if the shortest way of forming 
youth to act in their proper spheres, as good men and good citizens, ought al- 
ways to be the object of education, these two classes should be educated on a 
very different plan. The knowledge of the learned languages, as the means 
of acquiring other useful knowledge, is indispensably necessary to the first class. 
To the second, the time thus spent might be otherwise employed, as they never 
have occasion to make use of those languages. A less extensive acquaintance 
with the sciences, except arithmetic and mathematics, will also serve their 
purpose. 
Any scheme, then, that either proposes to teach both these grand classes after 
the same manner, or is wholly calculated for one of them, without regarding 
the other, must be very defective. And yet so it is, that public seminaries are 
almost universally calculated for the first class; while a collegiate school for 
the instruction of the latter, is rarely to be met with. This class of people, by 
far the most numerous, and also the hands and strength of every government, 
are overlooked, and have nothing but this alternative left them, either to be 
satisfied with what small portion of the arts and sciences they can glean at 
private schools, or to go through a course of learning at colleges, for which they 
have neither time nor use.* 
In 1826 the governing board of Amherst College received a copy 
of the “ Report of the Amherst Faculty ”—a very notable contrast to 
the recommendations contained in the “ Address to the Trustees of 
Amherst College by the Class of 1885.” In that report the following 
paragraphs occurred: 
One fact, we take it, is becoming more and more obvious every day. The 
American public is not satisfied with the present course of education in our 
higher seminaries; and the great objection is that it is not sufficiently modern 
and comprehensive to meet the exigencies of the age and country in which we 
live. * * * The complaint is, and if our ears do not deceive us it daily waxes 
louder and louder, that while everything else is on the advance our colleges are 
stationary, or if not quite stationary that they are in danger of being left far 
behind in the rapid march of improvement. 
Why, it is demanded, such reluctance to admit modern improvement and 
modern literature? Why so little attention to the natural, civil, and political 
history of our own country and to the genius of our Government? Why so 
little regard to the French and Spanish languages, especially considering the 
commercial relations which are now so rapidly forming, and which bid fair to 
be indefinitely extended between the United States and all the great southern 
Republics? Why should my son, who is to be a merchant at home or an agent 
in some foreign port, or, why, if he is to inherit my fortune, and wishes to 
qualify himself for the duties and standing of a private gentleman or a scien- 
tific farmer—why, in either case, should he be compelled to spend nearly four

years out of six in the study of the dead languages, for which he has no taste, 
from which he expects to derive no material advantage, and for which he will 
in fact have but little use after his senior examination.’ 
The indictment presented in the vigorous protests of the present 
time is certainly serious enough end much of it is well founded. But 
the responsibility for the alleged faults is by no means easily placed. 
The loudest complaints come from the secondary schools; but the 
tremendous increase in the number of high schools and the wide 
variations in their organization make the present a time of great un- 
certainty of aim and function in the field of secondary education, 
where the problems are more difficult and pressing than in any other 
section of the educational world. 
A long distance already traveled is not always a source of comfort 
in the* weariness and perplexity of the day’s end; and the great 
stretch of progress between the college of the middle of the eight- 
eenth century, or the lineal descendant of that college in the middle 
of the nineteenth century, and the university of to-day does not 
prove the perfection of the present institution or system. But it is 
both interesting and significant of the process of advance in education 
to contrast the statesmanlike utterances of the present president of 
Yale University with these words of President Clap, of Yale College, 
spoken in 1754: 
Colleges are Religious Societies of a Superior Nature to all others. For 
whereas Parishes are Societies for training up the Common People, Colleges are 
Societies of Ministers for training up persons for the work of the Minis- 
try. * * * Some, indeed, have supposed that the only design of Colleges was 
to teach the Arts and Sciences. * * * But it is probable that there is not a 
College to be found upon Harth upon such a Constitution.” 
While Yale is still true to her early function of training ministers, 
the range of her 10 departments, reaching up to the forest school and 
the graduate school, and the depth of her democratic sentiment show 
how wisely she has kept step with the nation’s progress while keeping 
faith with herself. 
STANDARDS IN EDUCATION. 
The wide demand for the elevation and better definition of stand- 
ards is not simply an academic matter. Several of the most impor- 
tant standardizing agencies have direct, practical, and even vital 
reasons for demanding improved standards and a more exact classi- 
fication. For example, the State board of health or of medicine 
in many States receives authority to establish the conditions upon 
which a license to practice medicine in the State shall be granted. 
Frequently it is required that the candidate shall have graduated

40 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
from a “recognized” or “ reputable” medical school. But who shall 
determine which medical schools are recognizable or reputable? In 
order to meet this reasonable demand and to prevent the establish- 
ment of many varying standards, the American Medical Association, 
through its Council on Medical Education, has done most valuable 
service in promoting general recognition of the standard set for 
medical colleges by the revised ordinance of the State of New York, 
and adopted by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of 
Teaching as its standard: 
An institution to be ranked as a medical college must have at least six pro- 
fessors, giving their entire time to medical work, a graded course of four full 
years of college grade in medicine, and must require for admission not less 
than the usual four years of academic or high-school preparation or its equiva- 
lent, in addition to the pre-academic or grammar-school studies. . 
It is in the same line of definition and improvement of standards 
that the National Association of State Universities endeavors to 
determine what professional schools may be called standard or 
“reputable: ” 
We may define a standard American university to be an institution * * * 
(4) which offers professional courses based upon the completion of two years 
of collegiate work, in law or medicine or engineering. 
The results of this campaign for improved conditions of medical 
institutions and practice, a campaign in which the medical profes- 
sion, the universities and medical college men, and the Carnegie 
Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching have united their 
efforts, may be seen both in the field of medical education and in the 
raised standards in various States for admission to the practice of 
medicine. An editorial in the Journal of the American Medical 
Association (Aug. 19, 1911) gives this summary: 
At the beginning of its work in 1905, after a thorough investigation of con- 
ditions, the Council [on Medical Education] formulated two standards of 
medical education, one for immediate adoption, and an ideal standard for 
future consideration. These standards were not for any one State or any one 
section, but for the entire country. The result is that nearly all colleges are 
up to or beyond the standard recommended in 1905 for “immediate adoption,” 
while more than a third of the colleges (42) have, so far as entrance require- 
ments are concerned, adopted the ideal, namely, a four-year high-school educa- 
tion, at least one year to include thorough courses in physics, chemistry, biology, 
and modern languages. 
In 1910, after two inspections of medical colleges, the Council on 
Medical Education had secured such unprecedented improvement in 
physical equipment and methods of medical education that it placed 
in its class A 61 colleges or schools of medicine giving a complete 
four-year course and 10 schools, departments, or colleges of medi- 
cine doing acceptably the first two years only of a standard four-year 
course.

HIGHER EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES. 41 
In the endeavor to define the standards for admission to the bar, 
for admission to practice dentistry, pharmacy, optometry, or veteri- 
nary medicine, and for granting high-school teachers’ certificates, a 
similar process of standardization must go on. Authority must be 
lodged somewhere to determine what constitutes a “reputable” law 
school, a “reputable” college, and a “reputable” normal school. 
Nor is this merely a matter pertaining to this country alone. The 
uncertainty of the meaning of American degrees, not to mention the 
unfortunate uncertainty as to their genuineness, which troubles 
European universities and officials in dealing with American students 
pursuing graduate work and holders of American professional de- 
grees desiring to practice their professions in European countries, is 
a standing reflection upon the administrative methods of controlling 
degree-granting institutions. The President of the Republic of 
Cuba in February, 1911, recommended a regulation refusing recog- 
nition by the National University of Cuba to professional degrees 
which are not recognized by the States in which they are issued as 
sufficient to exempt holders of them from examinations for practicing 
their professions. 
The desirability of a certain amount of uniformity of standards 
and of prescriptions for admission to the practice of a profession 
in the different States is undisputed. The mobility of the popula- 
tion of the United States increases rather than diminishes, and 
lawyers, physicians, and teachers rightly inveigh against the various 
and often unusual requirements for licenses as they seek to change 
residence. The legal regulation of these matters rests and ought 
to continue to rest wholly with the States; the standards of educa- 
tion and of requirements for the professions will for a long time to 
come vary in different sections; yet definite progress toward uni- 
formity is taking place through meetings of national associations 
of professional men; through such meetings as the conference of the 
chief State school officers of the North Central and Western States 
at Salt Lake City in November, 1910, and at Topeka in October, 1911; 
through the coordinating activity of the Bureau of Education of the 
United States; and through reciprocal agreements like those made 
for the indorsement of medical licenses between the States of New 
York and Indiana, New York and Wisconsin, and New York and 
Utah.* 
The organization of the Association of American Universities in 
1900 gave to the European universities almost for the first. time some- 
thing approaching a national standard for judging American col- 
legiate degrees. The acceptance of this standard for practical pur- 
poses by one great institution was conveyed in the following commu-   
1Seventh Annual Report of the Education Department of the State of New York 
(1910), pp. 273-280.

nication from the faculty of philosophy of the University of Berlin 
to the secretary of the Association of American Universities in July, 
1904: 
The faculty of philosophy of the Friedrich-Wilhelm University have the honor 
to notify you of the following regulation concerning candidacy for the doctor’s 
degrees, adopted on July 19, 1904: 
The faculty recognizes every baccalaureate degree (A. b., B. Se., etc.) ac- 
quired at an American university as the equivalent of the German testimonium 
maturitatis (Maturitiitszeugniss). 
Second. In order to have graduate work pursued at the American university 
accredited by this faculty,.upon proper approval of the ministry, toward the 
three years of study prescribed by this university for the degree of doctor of 
philosophy, the candidate must have taken his graduate work at one of the 
institutions represented in the Association of American Universities. The can- 
didate must, however, have been in residence at a German university for at 
least three semesters.* 
The secretary of the association at the same meeting announced 
informally that the Dutch Government had taken official action, by 
a royal order of February 12, 1904, by which students holding the 
degree of bachelor of arts from one of the institutions of the Associa- 
tion of American Universities should be admitted without examina- 
tion to Dutch universities under all faculties. 
Valuable as this recognition of the high standard of the bachelors’ 
degrees granted by members of the Association of American Univer- 
sities undoubtedly is, the slowness with which that association has 
enlarged its membership has worked not merely a hardship but also 
an injustice to many American students seeking degrees in Europe. 
Not many institutions will seriously complain of the limitation placed 
upon the recognition of the equivalence of graduate study in America 
with that prescribed by the University of Berlin for its degree of 
doctor of philosophy, even though the holder of a degree from a 
strong college in America is probably quite as well advanced toward 
his Ph. D. as the German university student at the end of his first 
year. But just ground for complaint certainly exists in the fact that 
the bachelor’s degree from a large number of other institutions is 
now quite as significant as a measure of power and achievement as 
the corresponding degree from the institutions composing the mem- 
bership of the association. An association “ composed of institutions 
on the North American Continent engaged in giving advanced or 
graduate instruction ” can not be expected to comprise all institutions 
whose degree of bachelor of arts should be considered standard or 
first class. 
At the present time at least 22 organizations, public or private, are 
engaged more or less effectively in determining the standards of in-

The Bureau of Education of the United States has but recently 
undertaken to share in the evaluation of the work and standards of 
institutions of higher education. The appointment of a specialist in 
higher education and the organization of the Division of Higher Edu- 
cation are the first steps in the fulfillment of carefully worked-out 
plans of the bureau for the prolonged, difficult, and delicate task of. 
ascertaining exactly the worth of the degrees granted by the widely’ 
varying institutions in the United States. As a Federal office, re- 
sponsible only to the Federal authorities, with no reasons for preju- 
dice for or against sections, States, or particular institutions, with 
means at its disposal for gaining the necessary information as to the 
organization, the resources, the equipment of buildings, libraries, 
laboratories, and lands, the personnel of faculty and student body, 
the dominating spirit as tested by present conditions and by alumni, 
the logic of its position gives promise of opportunities for service to 
education both unusual and permanent. In contrast with the States, 
its service will be nation-wide; instead of varying standards of judg- 
ment in different sections, one standard will be applied to all; without 
power to coerce, its chief instruments will be impartiality, insight, 
and publicity. Having no funds to give or withhold and no special 
propaganda to promote, and having a reasonable probability of the 
acceptance of its judgment both at home and abroad, the bureau 
already feels assured of a cordiality of cooperation in its investiga-

tions which has not always been granted to other investigators of 
like purpose. If the bureau can prepare and publish a classification 
of the degree-granting institutions of the country upon such broad 
principles and upon such adequate information as to commend itself 
to all bodies having to rate the products of these institutions, always 
granting the necessity and reserving the right to make revisions of the 
classification upon later information, a large service will be rendered 
to the whole group of educational interests of the country. 
ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. 
The process of standardization of professional schools and of 
colleges and universities necessarily involves the question of stand- 
ards of secondary schools. This is especially true in the widening 
areas in which prevails the system of accrediting high schools by 
institutional or State authority, so that their students may enter 
higher institutions without examination. In these regions the bond of 
sympathy, understanding, and coordinate aims between the higher 
schools and the professional colleges on the one hand, and the sec- 
ondary schools on the other, grows stronger and more vital. The 
North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools, one 
of the vigorous standardizing agencies, gives its chief consideration 
to the preparation of lists of accredited schools in the 13 States which 
have representation in that association. It publishes annually a list 
of all high schools accredited by its regular board of inspectors. The 
association has for some time had under consideration the classifica- 
tion of colleges in the same area, but no list has as yet been published. 
| The very tightening of this bond between the higher and the mid- 
dle schools has raised new and acute difficulties of administration, 
as well as of theory, for both parties to the relation. From the high 
schools are demanded immediate practical results, benefits for the 
great majority in terms of dollars per month next year, regardless of 
the desirability of taking 2 or 4 years more to gain better equipment 
and impetus for the life of the next 50 years. On the side of the col- 
lege, the university, or technical school, the question is rather that of 
standards for estimating the particular forms of discipline urged as 
substitutes for those which long experience has tested and approved. 
A most hopeful sign in the present confusion and transition in 
which experimentation with entrance requirements goes on, some- 
times seriously and conservatively, sometimes almost merrily and flip- 
pantly, is that few, if any, of the larger institutions are quite so 
confident of the finality of their schemes of admission, and of their 
curricula for turning out gentlemen and scholars, as most institu- 
tions were 25 years ago. The proportion of fixed requirements to 
electives, the range of electives, and the methods of administration
-P-A-G-E-65
    
   HIGHER EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES. 45 
vary widely. Several of the great State universities have almost 
alarmingly enlarged the range of combinations possible for admis- 
sion. Agriculture, commercial subjects, domestic science, shop work, 
and music claim peers’ rights under the new constitution alongside 
Latin, chemistry, and geometry. Harvard University and the Uni- 
versity of Chicago have also announced rather radical changes in 
requirements and methods for admission. 
It is no longer a valid argument for the retention of Latin to say 
that the old prescription of requirements produced strong men in 
citizenship, affairs, and letters. Many leaders in higher education 
are convinced that other subjects properly taught give equally good 
results in discipline, inspiration, and cultural uplovk and outlook. 
An admission of the correctness of the position of these leaders by 
no means settles the general outline of the subjects which may be 
offered in substitution. The burden of proof is placed squarely on 
all new claimants for recognition; they must make clear beyond a 
reasonable doubt that their instruction contributes surely and 
directly toward producing a mind soundly trained to reason exactly, 
and vitally quickened with serious purpose to learn more and to serve 
better. The recognition of shopwork, for example, as a proper sub- 
ject for secondary instruction and for recognition as an elective for 
college entrance is not fundamentally based upon the desire to pro- 
duce more and better mechanics; more corn, apples, and milk are by- 
products of instruction in agriculture in the high schools, from the 
point of view of the college committee of registration. 
The appeal of the new subjects to the interest of the pupils in 
the secondary schools ‘is a valid reason for their introduction into 
the curriculum, in so far as it enables schools to train a larger 
number for a larger activity in society. Colleges and universities, 
on the other hand, have a right to insist that those who are presented 
to them by the secondary schools shall have power to think, to ap- 
preciate, to express, and to accomplish, in more than one field of 
scholastic endeavor. It is with this demand in mind that such insti- 
tutions as the University of Wisconsin and the University of Cali- 
fornia have voted to accept vocational subjects only when properly 
combined with corresponding fundamental subjects or when taught 
in a manner specially approved. In blocks of one, two, three, or 
four units, constituting as a rule not more than one-fourth of the 
total requirements for admission, the vocational or industrial sub- 
jects may be presented, with such limitations as these: Mechanic 
arts (woodwork, forge work, etc.) when linked with freehand and 
geometrical drawing; domestic science with chemistry; horticulture 
with botany. The University of California accepts bookkeeping 
for one unit, stenography one or two units, but with the positive 
restriction that proficiency in these subjects is to be tested at the
-P-A-G-E-66
  46 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
university. For one unit in stenography and typewriting “the 
student must show ability to take stenographic dictation at the rate 
of 75 words per minute;” for two units the rate is 125 words per 
minute. The University of ‘Wisconsin announces that “work in 
any of the vocational groups will be accepted only after inspection 
and approval by the university.” 
The insistent demand of the secondary-school men has been heard 
and heeded in two significant quarters, not wholly disconnected. 
Resolutions regarding entrance requirements were passed by the 
department of secondary education of the National Education As- 
sociation at its meetings in 1910 and 1911. It should be noted that 
the committee of nine making the report which was adopted by the 
department in 1911 contained only two college or university men, 
Charles H. Judd, professor of education, University of Chicago, 
and Alexis F. Lange, professor of the theory and practice of educa- 
tion and dean of the faculties, University of California. The com- 
mittee holds that “ college admission should be based solely upon the 
completion of a well-planned high-school course,” which it proceeds 
to define as follows: ; 
(1) A quantitative requirement of 15 units, exclusive of physical training 
and music. (2) Every high-school course should include at least three units 
of English, one unit of social science (including history), and one unit of 
natural science. (3) Every high-school course should include the completion 
of two majors of three units each and one minor of two units, and one of the 
majors should be English. (4) A maximum of two units of mathematics and 
two units of one language other than English. (5) Four units of the 15 should 
be left as a margin to be used for additional academic work or for mechanic 
arts, household science, commercial work, and any other kind of work that the 
best interests of the student appear to-require. (In place of either two units 
of mathematics or two units of a foreign language, the substitution under 
proper supervision should be allowed of two units consisting of a second unit 
of natural science. )* 
The same social and educational pressure which produced the 
report just described and effected its adoption is in evidence in the 
modified plan for entrance which the University of Chicago, as the 
result of two years of committee work, has adopted and announced: 
The new program accords to the high schools a much larger degree of inde- 
pendence in the arrangement of their curricula than has hitherto been the 
case. The university will still require 15 units of work, four full years in an : 
approved high school (from which students may enter by certificate), but it 
will allow much greater flexibility in the studies which the high-school stu- 
dents may pursue during their preparatory course. 
The university has been moved to make these changes largely because it 
appreciates and sympathizes with the increasing demand laid upon high schools 
‘to meet the important needs of their own communities. In response to pres- 
sure of this kind the schools have found it necessary to introduce a larger 
amount of vocational work than was formerly the case. The old academic

subjects, rightly or wrongly, are not thought to subserve these community 
needs so efficiently as are subjects of a more practical character. In view of 
this movement which is going forward in the high schools of the country, the 
university has come to feel that its previous entrance requirements are out of 
harmony with the primary obligations of the schools in a way which is unde- 
sirable for all concerned. The action which is now taken is not dictated by a 
loss of numbers, for these have steadily increased; it is rather based upon the 
conviction that its previous practice is no longer wise and that the best interests 
of the schools and of the university will be subserved by other arrangements.* 
The new entrance requirements of the University of Chicago are: 
(1) English, three units. 
(2) Three units of one group and two units of another from the 
following five groups of studies— 
(a) Ancient and classical languages. 
(0) Modern languages. 
(c) History and economic science. 
(d) Mathematics. 
(e) Natural sciences. 
(8) Two units selected from any of the five groups just enumerated. 
(4) Five units elective, which may be “ selected from any subjects 
for which credit toward graduation is given by the approved school 
from which the student receives his diploma.” Certain restrictions 
are involved with this statement, for example, “ Latin may not be 
continued in college unless at least two units be offered.” 
A very important feature accompanying the change in the entrance 
requirements of the University of Chicago is the announcement that 
“as an offset to this increased freedom the university expects here- 
after to receive no students with conditions.” As a further safeguard 
and by way of supplementing the careful examination of schools 
which precedes placing them on its approved list with the privilege 
of entering students by certificate, the university especially empha- 
sizes its reliance upon the records made by students coming to the 
university from a particular school. Records of the standings of the 
students sent by the school will be carefully prepared by the univer- 
sity for its own use and for the authorities of the school. Another 
supplementary and very promising feature of the plan—one which 
should add definiteness and sympathy to the process of coordinating 
the work of the school and the university—is the suggestion of visits 
of representatives of the schools to university classes in which work 
is done continuing that of the schools. It would not be surprising 
if this inspection by the teachers should operate distinctly to the 
improvement of instruction in the freshman and sophomore classes 
in the University of Chicago—and in any other university making 
the same excellent experiment—as the former personal inspection by

examining officers of the university operated to the improvement of 
instruction in the secondary schools. 
The new plan of admission to Harvard University, which was 
adopted by the faculty in January, 1911, is to be tried as an alterna- 
tive for the present examination system; only time will tell whether 
it will supplant the old system or not. The main features of the new 
order are: 
(1) The satisfactory completion by the applicant for admission of an ap- 
proved school course, not, be it noted, the completion of a course in an approved 
or accredited school, which is the essence of the accrediting system. To be ad- 
mitted under this plan the official detailed statement of his school record, 
which the applicant must present, must show (@) the subjects studied by him 
and the ground covered; (b) the amount of time he has devoted to each sub- 
ject; (c) the quality of his work in each subject. To be approved, this state- 
ment must show (a) that his course has extended over four years; (b) that it 
has been mainly devoted to languages, science, mathematics, and history, no 
one of which may be omitted; (¢) that it must include two studies which the 
candidate has pursued beyond their elementary stages. 
(2) Satisfactory examinations in four subjects: (a) English; (6) Latin for 
candidates for the degree of A. B., and French or German for candidates for 
the degree of S. B.; (c) mathematics or science (physics or chemistry) ; (d) 
any subject not already selected from (0b) or (c) from the following list: 
Greek, French, German, history, mathematics, physics, chemistry. 
Clearly this is a system radically different from any now in opera- 
tion. It might be called an examination-discretion system, the opera- 
tion of which may enable Harvard to pick the best from a very wide 
range of applicants, to extend the present narrow area from which 
the university draws its students, and to establish that close and vital 
relation with public high schools. against which the present system 
of rigid examinations has steadily operated. The chairman of the 
committee on admission of Harvard University, Mr. J. G. Hart, 
writes: 
The new Harvard plan does not prescribe what or how a boy shall study, 
but leaves the schools free to work out their own systems of education in their 
own way in accordance with the best interests of their pupils and the needs of 
the communities in which they are situated. * * * No longer will it be nec- 
essary to fit the school course to the college prescriptions; no longer will it be 
necessary for the boy to know several years in advance that he is going to 
college. No boy who has had a rationally planned school course will be pre- 
vented from entering, even though he may decide to come to Harvard very 
late in his school course. Heretofore Harvard has been confined in her choice 
of students to a pitifully insignificant number of schools. Hereafter the college 
will be able to draw good students from any good school in the country.* 
The history of the movement for less dependence upon examina- 
tions as the test for admission indicates that Harvard is trying out 
a new plan which has been practically agreed upon by the New 
England colleges, and which they will adopt if it works well at Har-

vard. Ata meeting of the Association of New England Colleges, 
held at Amherst in November, 1910, at which were representatives 
of Yale, Harvard, Dartmouth, Willems, Amherst, Bowdoin, Ver- 
mont, Trinity, Middlebury, Tutts, Boston University, Wesleyan, and 
Clark, a resolution reported by a subcommittee consisting of Presi- 
dents Hadley, Lowell, and Hyde was unanimously adopted: 
Resolved, That the association recommends that the New England colleges 
adopt a system of tests for admission in which a certificate shall be taken for 
quantity, and an examination shall be held in a limited number of substantial 
subjects for the quality of school work.’ 
In his annual report for 1911, President Hadley discusses at length 
the problem of admission requirements to Yale. Concerning the 
policy just described, he says: 
Harvard has committed itself to this policy. The arguments in its favor 
seem strong. Ten years ago I urged its adoption by Yale, but the practical 
difficulties of putting it into effect were shown to be very great. Until we know 
how Harvard is going to meet these difficulties it would be premature to dis- 
cuss the plan or to try to decide whether it is better or worse than the old- 
fashioned certificate system.” 
But when all has been said that can be said in favor of the greatest 
enlargement of the range of possible subjects for satisfying entranco 
requirement, it remains true that a certain element of educational 
politics lies behind the demand. The very words, “ agricultural,” 
“ industrial,” “ vocational,” appeal with peculiar force to any recently 
-awakened constituency feeling its way toward a realization of its 
social ideals. Perhaps it is one manifestation of the improving atti- 
tude of democracy toward education. The exact objects to be at- 
tained by higher education are by no means clear in the average 
mind of to-day. Until recently the way to a higher education has 
stretched along a path very hard, limited, and closely prescribed, 
especially for the boy who has aroused somewhat late in his secondary 
course to the inspiring possibilities of his own development. This 
prescribed curriculum has too often lacked attractiveness and stimu- 
lus, and however admirable it may still be for those whom it grips, 
there may be other forms of preparation for effective disinterested 
leadership than the traditional fitting-school course. But even so, 
why should the colleges and universities be expected to accept for 
the satisfaction of entrance requirements all the widely different 
subjects which any well-intentioned, forceful, hobby-riding superin- 
tendent or principal may think necessary in order to adapt his school 
to its local constituency ? 
Be it noted that the quarrel here is not between the college and 
community which chooses to support polytechnic, trade, or vocational

secondary schools, but between the college which properly insists that 
certain fundamentals of ability and certain degrees of knowledge 
and power must be demonstrated on the part of applicants for ad- 
mission, on the one hand, and on the other those persons who insist 
that any form of knowledge or skill is as good as any other, provided 
it generates interest, enthusiasm, and ambition. It was, and is, a 
foolish demand that all educational roads should lead to a collegiate 
Rome. Such Rome is no longer one city, but many. Her seven hills 
have become seventy times seven, with here and there a great moun- 
tain rising above the lesser hills, a great university full of inspira- 
tion for research and for leadership. But the way to all of these 
demands the same old qualities of mind and will, and even sterner 
preparation, however varied. 
THE WORTH OF DEGREES. 
The improvement in standards of higher education and of admis- 
sion to various professions has given new definiteness and worth to 
collegiate and university degrees. To men without a degree, certain 
doors are closed, or opened only with great difficulty. The mere 
possession of the degree of C. E., for example, does not guarantee its 
holder a position or the ability to retain the position if he gets it; 
but the degree certainly raises a presumption that its possessor is a 
better engineer than a man of like age and native ability without 
the degree. The requirement of a standard bachelor’s degree for a 
certificate as a high-school teacher in many States gives a positive 
value to that degree, while other degrees are presumably signs of 
personal or professional attainments. The public and the profes- 
sions have the same right to demand that these degrees shall at least 
approximate a widely accepted standard as they have to insist that 
coins in the market shall be genuine and approximately full weight. 
The very fact that a degree has real value encourages the multiplica- 
tion within the limits of the law of agencies ‘for supplying the 
demand for degrees. 
The practice of granting easy, unusual, and even absurd degrees 
by institutions legally chartered has been the source of strenuous 
protest and complaint in many circles for the last 40 years. Not 
the least offensive phase of the practice is that of selling to foreigners 
degrees purporting to be granted by American institutions. In his 
Reports for 1876 and 1880 the Commissioner of Education discusses 
at length certain notorious cases, especially that of the American 
University of Philadelphia and its allied institutions, whose granting 
of medical degrees resulted in the exposure and conviction of 
“Doctor” John Buchanan. 
Recently the Bureau of Education has received from abroad several 
complaints of the continuance of the practice of selling honorary de- 
grees, or at least of conferring them in indiscriminate fashion, An

English correspondent writes regarding the “ relative value of degrees 
issued from various American institutions of learning,” adding: 
“ Over here we have had a bad time over the business and have been 
let in for a lot of trouble. Some of our men have the LL. D. from 
all sorts of centers.” Then follow the names of six institutions, one 
of which is that of a well-known college in Georgia, another is a 
Negro college in North Carolina, while a third is really a prepara- 
tory school in Wisconsin. 
The number of institutions conferring degrees of uncertain value 
has increased rather than decreased in recent years. The mere fact 
that each one probably possesses legal authority under a charter to 
grant some of the degrees mentioned later in this chapter does not 
of itself give weight to the degree. The varying amount of work re- 
quired by degree-granting institutions for the highest and most hon- 
orable academic degrees is illustrated by the following statement: 
For the degree of Ph. D. the University of Chicago requires— 
1. As preliminary a bachelor’s degree from the University of Chicago, or one 
substantially equal to it. 3 
2. At least three years of resident work at the university, with the possi- 
bility of substitution of nonresident work for resident work to a limited extent, 
and with the possibility of credit of one and a half years for resident work at 
another university. “The degree of doctor of philosophy may, in exceptional 
cases, be granted after one year of residence.” 
8. A thesis which must “ constitute an actual contribution to knowledge.” 
4, A satisfactory final examination upon work done in preparation for the 
degree, such work to include one principal and either one or two secondary 
subjects. 
Per contra, the Potomac University, Washington, D. C., recently 
made the following stipulations for granting the degree of Ph. D.: 
1. The completion of four of the following courses: 
Course A.—Dealey : Development of the State. 
Willoughby: Nature of the State. 
Course B.—Coman: Industrial History of the United States. 
Ely: Outlines of Economics. 
Course C.—Ripley: Trusts, Pools, and Corporations.

Oprssa, WASH., September 21, 1911. 
Dear Sir: It has been represented to me that you are well entitled to the 
Degree of Docror of Drvinrry, by reason of your work in the Congregational 
Church. If you care to send ten dollars for our Library and answer a few 
questions, a Diploma for that Degree will be sent you. A Fine Drproma hung on 
the wall of your Study will enlarge your reputation. 
A similar letter was recently received by an anesthetist in the office 
of a Baltimore physician, and sent to this bureau for its judgment. 
In this case the honorary degree of doctor of science was offered. 
In transmitting this letter to the Federal authorities the physician 
properly commented: “If the ‘laws of Congress’ allow these people 
to send diplomas for $10 and to support themselves by so doing, they 
ought to be looked into.” 
The differentiation of earned and honorary degrees becomes 
steadily more sharply marked. The stronger institutions exercise the 
privilege of granting honorary degrees with ever greater restraint 
and discretion—except upon anniversaries and inaugurations—con- 
fining themselves, as a rule, to the granting of the degrees of doctor 
of laws, doctor of divinity, doctor of letters, doctor of civil law, and 
occasionally master of arts. Only in very rare instances does a col- 
lege grant an honorary bachelor’s degree. By general agreement the 
degrees of doctor of philosophy and doctor of science are looked upon 
as research degrees, to be granted only after three or more years of 
specialized graduate study and research. Even the master’s degree, 
which was formerly granted “in course” by many colleges to those 
of their graduates who pursued for two or three years after gradu- 
ation literary or professional work, is now generally granted only for 
a year of regular postgraduate or advanced work done in residence.

the promotion of professional standing or prestige, is rightly looked 
upon as approaching unprofessional conduct. 
For these reasons, stricter Federal and State laws are urgently 
needed to safeguard the public from imposition and to insure that 
only standard degrees receive recognition. The sufficiency of the 
powers and functions of the regents of the University of the State of 
New York, in regard to chartering and controlling colleges and pro- 
fessional institutions, is admirable, but, unfortunately, almost unique. 
It is almost disheartening to contrast the inspiring practical results 
arising under the exacting and well-enforced laws and regulations of 
New York with the results flowing from the very loose, almost totally 
inadequate laws of the District of Columbia, under which degree- 
granting institutions obtain charters. Section 61 of the education 
law of New York requires that institutions, to receive power to con- 
fer degrees, must have resources of at least $500,000, and make suit- 
able provisions, approved by the board of regents, for buildings, fur- 
niture, educational equipment, and proper maintenance, while still 
other sections further protect degrees in that State. But under the 
laws relating to the District of Columbia the Eastern University 
received a certificate of incorporation November 11, 1904, with the 
following powers, among others: 
To issue to those who have pursued such courses of instruction therein 
[as previously specified], and duly completed courses prescribed thereby, or 
passed the prescribed examination either by correspondence or otherwise, the 
degrees of B. A., M. A., Ph. D., B. S., M. D., LL. B., LL. D., Ph. G., LL. M., 
DD. S., D. D., D. O. (osteopathy and osteotherapy), D. M. (medical massage), 
D. C. (chiropractic), D. E. (electrotherapeutics), D. P. (chiropody), and 
D. Psychol.; also the grating of diplomas setting forth the completion of 
such work as may entitle the persons completing the same to evidence thereof 
in the form of such diploma. * * * To establish institutions of learning of 
the character hereinbefore set forth; to have one or more offices and to carry

United States, or in any foreign country or place, and to have and exercise all 
powers conferred by the laws of the District of Columbia upon corporations. 
(4) The term of its existence shall be perpetual. 
(5) This corporation reserves the right to establish branches of this university 
in all parts of the world, 
The laws of some of the States regulating the incorporation of 
colleges are so loose that some remarkable institutions have appeared. 
The Carnegie University was chartered in Delaware. Its pub- 
lished announcement for 1911 contains no evidence as to its property, 
its faculty (save its president and corporation officers), or its labora- 
tories, but states that the institution is authorized to give all kinds 
of degrees, following up the statement with the enumeration of 26 
different degrees, ranging from doctor of philosophy to doctor of 
dermal art. The activity of the Carnegie University, through its 
affiliations, is illustrated by the following advertisement in the New 
York World of Sunday, September 10, 1911:

The Oriental University, of Washington, D. C., under a Virginia 
charter, has granted the degrees of doctor of orientalistics and bach- 
elor of aeronautics (B. Aer.). 
Degrees conferred in absentia—The demand for opportunities to 
obtain degrees by doing work through correspondence has led sev- 
eral long-established colleges to adopt some of the methods of corre- 
spondence schools, applying them even to the highest research 
degrees, contrary to the general tendency to grant such degrees only 
for work done in residence. The following may be cited as ex- 
amples: Ewing College, Illinois, carries this announcement in its 
catalogue: 
For some years Ewing College has had a nonresident course leading to the 
degree of Ph. D. Only those who have completed the full college course are 
entitled to enter for this degree. Its object is to give the student some of the 
latest and best thought, to arm him against error of the times, and to equip 
him for the battle of life. No course has brought the college so much favor 
as this. Those desiring to know more concerning it should write the president 
for literature on the subject. a 
Grove City College has for some years offered in its post-graduate 
department courses leading to the Ph. D., requiring “ at least one ses- 
sion’s attendance,” which session may bea summer term. Only courses 
in philosophical studies are now offered. Illinois Wesleyan Univer- 
sity for many years had a large registration of nonresident students 
and granted numerous degrees for such nonresidence work, but the 
trustees voted in 1905 “ that enrollment should cease in all [nonresi- 
dent] courses by July, 1906. * * * It was further agreed that 
those who enrolled in the courses July 1, 1906, should be given four 
years from that date in which to complete their work, and that no 
degrees should be conferred in these courses after June, 1910.”

COOPERATION OF SUPERVISING AND INVESTIGATING AGENCIES. 
The various agencies already enumerated which are concerned with 
the problems of standardization and with the betterment of condi- 
tions in the field of higher education have realized anew the need of 
cooperation and have taken steps to secure it. A vast field, keen 
struggle for its possession, complexity of involved interests, and the 
strong tendency to centralization or combination in the business 
world have slowly but surely demonstrated that failure to cooperate 
would mean wasteful duplication of effort, the perpetuation of unnec- 
essary divergent standards, and continuance of unwholesome rivalries. 
Recognizing these facts, numerous forms of cooperation appear. 
The Bureau of Education finds cordial and generous assistance at 
the offices of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teach- 
ing and of the General Education Board. Reports prepared at great 
expense of time and money and repfesenting the maturest judgment 
of highly trained and experienced specialists are mutually and semi- 
confidentially exchanged. Conferences of chief State school officers 
of the North Central and Western States, conferences of secretaries 
or business agents of State universities, and the various State and 
sectional organizations of college and university men like the College 
Presidents’ Association of Pennsylvania, and the Association of Col- 
leges in the State of New York, are highly significant evidences of 
the movement toward completer cooperation. 
A large part of the total number of colleges and universities in the 
United States are either under direct control of some religious 
denomination or in close affiliation with it. The very existence of 
many of them is a witness to denominational zeal and denominational 
competition rather than to a wise understanding of present and 
future needs of the community, just as the multiplication of weak 
churches in many a small town is a standing reflection upon the 
economy, altruism, and efficiency of the denominations concerned. 
The workings of social forces in many cases have already remedied 
some of the evils of this excessive planting of denominational institu- 
tions. Many colleges and universities in the West and South have 
disappeared after an ephemeral and troubled existence, frequently 
sharing the fate of the overambitious town or land company pri- 
marily interested in their promotion. 
Recently the great denominations concerned in the determination 
of which colleges have reasonable expectations of large permanent 
usefulness, and which in the nature of educational progress are™ 
likely to be candidates for entire suppression or amalgamation with 
stronger institutions, have organized a very practical and far-reach- 
ing federation. In February, 1911, the first step in this direction was 
taken at a conference of secretaries of boards of education of various 
 
-P-A-G-E-76
  56 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
churches. There were present the secretaries of the boards of educa- 
tion of the Methodist Episcopal Church, of the Presbyterian Church 
(both northern and southern divisions), of the Methodist Episcopal 
Church, South, of the Congregational Education Society, of the 
Lutheran Board of Education, and of the College Board of the 
Presbyterian Church. The second meeting was held in April, 1911, 
and there were present in addition to those just mentioned a repre- 
sentative of the Educational Board of the Society of Friends and the 
secretary of the General Education Board. The following principles 
were deduced as a result of the discussion of the situation in general: 
1. A large degree of cooperation between educational boards is practicable 
and desirable. Through them we might secure a better geographical distribu- 
tion of denominational colleges and valuable comity of relations in various par- 
ticulars, a proper standardization of institutions; in many instances, a better 
location and distribution of institutions, and large assistance through appro- 
priations to weak but high-grade schools for a limited period until they could 
meet the requirements of larger foundations, such as the General Education 
(Rockefeller) Board. 
2. A conviction that the denominations should offer loyal support to the 
public school system and cooperate in efforts to secure larger appropriations 
for grammar and high school from cities, counties, and States, and that this 
in no way interfered with their true mission in the sustentation of denomina- 
tional colleges. 
8. A strong conviction of the legitimacy and the absolute necessity of a cer- 
tain number of denominational academies, occupying strategic positions in terri- 
tory not fully occupied by the public high schools. There was a unanimous 
agreement that notwithstanding the growth of the public high school, there 
was a work which it did not and could not do, and that the support and main- 
tenance of these denominational academies was perfectly consistent with proper 
loyalty to the public and high school system. 
4, There was unanimous agreement that there should be a direct approach 
by the denominations to the problem of religious instruction at State university 
centers. It was shown that the State university needed the denominational 
college, and that in very important particulars the denominational college was 
helped by the State university in many ways. 
At the conclusion of the meeting it was voted to organize an 
interdenominational conference of representative denominational 
agencies, with the membership including the corresponding secre- 
tary of every denominational board of education, and in addition 
one representative of this board, presumably a layman appointed by 
the board itself. The following committees were authorized to report 
at a later meeting: 
(1) Comity and cooperation. 
(3) Academic efficiency. 
(8) Interdenominational campaign. 
(4) Religious work in State and denominational institutions. 
(5) Secondary schools. 
In discussing before this conference the problems of common in- 
terest to the denominations concerned, the corresponding secretary of
-P-A-G-E-77
  
HIGHER EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES. 57 
the board of education of the Congregational Church said concern- 
ing the merging of colleges: 
I think we shall agree that if the time has not come it will, inevitably, when 
this great question will have to be seriously considered. There is no doubt 
that if we were starting anew in this business of founding colleges we would not 
place some of them where they are now. They are not strategically located. 
Some were placed in the rural region. A present system might place them 
near centers of population. Some of them are too thickly clustered, and do not 
serve aS many of the population as they might. Some are under the auspices 
of denominations closely allied, and can not, therefore, justify themselves in 
these days when religious bodies are coming together. 
If these facts are recognized as to things that are past then a vital question 
arises, whether it is not time to readjust, as we may be able to do, this old 
order and combine certain colleges to the advantage of all concerned. 
But if this system can not be wisely changed at present, the committee would 
also consider whether there might not be more cooperation among our colleges 
in the way of courses of study. Two colleges, fifty or a hundred miles apart, 
need not try to cover the same ground, but one college might supplement the 
work of another. 
The actual withdrawal of a denomination from a field which it 
had entered probably unwisely is found in a recent action of the 
Reformed Church in America, in regard to one of its institutions in 
Oklahoma, which was established in the hope and expectation that 
the church would find a favorable field for development in the new 
State. After 10 years of effort and- thorough investigation the 
board of domestic missions of the Reformed Church voted to with- 
draw from Oklahoma and transfer its work there to other denomina- 
tions; and the board of education, feeling in like manner the lack of 
fellowship and the failure of reinforcement by new arrivals of their 
own denomination, voted in May, 1911, to close the institution in 
question and to sell the property, feeling “that there were those upon 
the ground who could do the work better than we.” 
Too much must not be expected from the first years of this sys- 
tematic cooperation of denominational agencies. Time alone can 
reveal which of the several institutions of a particular denomination 
in a given State like Ohio or Iowa, will finally survive as sturdy and 
energizing institutions. Local pride is strong; denominational pride 
is stronger, and the last experiment in increasing numbers by diversi- 
fication of courses, such as music, art, domestic science, agriculture, 
etc., has not been tried. But more and more a common policy of 
pressure from the great boards of a church, especially boards which 
have positive authority like the board of education of the Methodist 
Episcopal Church, South, and boards which have large influence in 
directing the benevolences of rich givers must be exercised to promote 
institutions which give promise of undoubted and cumulative useful- 
ness, and to restrain or restrict or reduce those struggling patheti-

cally to realize ambitions which to a sober and judicious outsider 
seem as misguided and unlikely of realization as they are honorable 
and time honored. 
STUDENT WELFARE MOVEMENTS. 
Expansion and the elevation of standards are fortunately not the 
only ideas looming large in the vision of college and university ad- 
ministrators. The danger of mere numbers, the fear of superficial 
training, the waste of energy due to miseducation, and the lack of 
direct personal influence upon the students have all at times de- 
pressed wise presidents and faculties. The machinery of a rapidly 
growing institution is improved from year to year; by careful plan- 
ning of curriculum, and elaborate provision for classrooms, labora- 
tories, libraries, and gymnasiums, each student may be given a 
location on the campus and a name on the books; by feverish en- 
deavor, endowments are amassed and incomes augmented to meet the 
overwhelming demands of the hordes which besiege the gates of 
great institutions. Great clubhouses like the Harvard Union arise, 
but after all, the very heart of the most vital problem of education, 
the inspiration of the student to seek and to work out his best capaci- 
ties through intellectual, moral, and physical endeavors, has too often 
been overlooked. Especially is this true in those institutions whose 
registration has passed the thousand mark. 
There are some professors whose ideal university is an institution 
without students, but the wise men in college administration will 
agree with the sagacious words of President Benjamin Ide Wheeler, 
that something must be done immediately to humanize the machine. 
Some adequate means must be provided to furnish each individual 
student with sympathetic, patient, stimulating, and widely informed 
counsel during the first year or two of his college course. Not more 
machinery, bigger equipment, smaller classes, more courses, nor even 
better classroom instruction will meet the needs of tens of thousands 
of students at that highly critical stage when they make the transi- 
tion from the restraints and prescriptions of a high school and home 
to the all but unrestrained and ill-regulated life of universities which 
have neither dormitories nor commons. Such students ought to have 
the touch of a great personality, an elder brotherliness, along with 
stern discipline in straight thinking, in mathematics, or economics, 
and clear speaking in English. 
It is heartening to notice the lengthening list of institutions in 
which the realization of these needs takes the form of definite pro- 
visions for student welfare in the large human sense of that good 
word. The enormous difficulties of the present problem in the great 
State universities of the West, which have been and still are the 
most delinquent in this matter, rather from sheer inability to cope
-P-A-G-E-79
HIGHER EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES. 59 
with the situation than from lack of sympathy or misunderstanding, 
may be understood in part through a.study of the figures of the 
growth of those organa of the Commonwealth. The registration of 
16 of the larger State universities, chiefly in the West, in 1894-95 was 
17,298; in 1909-10 it was 43,319, a growth of about 150 per cent. 
Similar figures for 16 of the larger privately supported institutions 
for the same period show an increase from 25,746 to 44,580, or about 
75 per cent; but better provision, at least in the matter of housing 
and feeding, has long been made by this latter group of institutions 
than by the public institutions. Exception should also be made of 
State universities in such southern States as Virginia, North Caro- 
lina, and Georgia, which have had dormitories almost from their 
beginnings. Fifteen years ago, not more than 2 or 3 of the 16 State 
institutions considered owned or controlled dormitories of any sort, 
and very few had even a modest Young Men’s Christian Association 
or club building. It was not at that time held to be one of the func- 
tions of the State to provide for the welfare of students outside of 
actual instruction in its various forms. 
Steadily, but by slow degrees, a better sentiment moved State 
boards and legislatures and private givers to provide for students 
wholesome and attractive housing, ennobling social surroundings, 
and opportunities for intercourse with each other and with the in- 
struction force. On the side of physical education and the support 
of sports and athletics little complaint can now be made. The 
visitor who strolls through the Harvard stadium, the stadium of 
Syracuse University, and the enormous plants devoted to athletics 
at the University of Wisconsin and the University of California 
marvels at the generosity of appreciation for this nonacademic phase 
of education. Several State universities have inaugurated the 
movement for dormitories for their students. Large appropriations 
have recently been made for dormitories for women at the Uni- 
versities of Minnesota and Wisconsin. Cornell University has in 
like manner undertaken to provide for men, as it has long provided 
for women. But these provisions of buildings, while they give op- 
portunity for improved intercourse and for placing better influences 
about the student body, do not reach the heart of the difficulty. 
Princeton University’s provision of a preceptorial system is the 
most elaborate, expensive, and widely discussed of welfare experi- 
ments of the last 10 years. Nearly two college generations have now 
been trained under it. Special interest, therefore, attaches to Presi- 
dent Woodrow Wilson’s summary of the purposes, workings, limita- 
tions, and prospects of the system in his annual report for the year 
ending January 1, 1910: 
This is the fifth year of the preceptorial system. We can look at it and assess 
it now in the light of experience. * * *  
-P-A-G-E-80
    60 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
It is not primarily a system of instruction. Its chief object is not efficient 
teaching. It is not an improved classroom method or a new way of drill to keep 
the pupil up to his tasks. It is a system of study primarily intended for the 
reading courses, to give to them means of work as direct, as simple, as indi- 
vidual as those long employed in the laboratories of the sciences. It has been 
too commonly supposed by observers—even by admiring observers—of the system 
outside Princeton that it is its characteristic feature that teachers meet their 
pupils informally in very small groups for intimate instruction. That is not the 
fundamental matter. The essence of the system is that “classes” and class- 
rooms are done away with, except for purposes of drill. <A “course” does not 
consist in following a certain teacher’s lectures or in “ getting up” certain texts 
to be recited in class. It consists in a body of reading such as any mature man 
would naturally undertake, whether he had the advantage of experienced guides 
and teachers or not, if he wished to make himself master of a certain subject. 
The men read subjects; they do not get up courses. * * * Grown men who 
have ceased to be schoolboys are systematically reading great subjects. That is 
the essential and central fact of the system. It is not a new method in peda- 
gogics. * * * Their [the preceptors’] object is, of course, to see that the 
men have actually done the reading that is to be discussed; but it is also to see 
that they have understood it, to render them counsel, assistance, and stimula- 
tion; and many of them have told me with great pleasure how they have seen 
their men grow under the process, begin to think for themselves, and insensibly 
learn to use books naturally. * * * In brief, these conferences between pre- 
ceptors and small groups of men assigned to their guidance (the groups range in 
number from two to six men) is a method of associating older students with 
younger upon as natural a footing as possible. 
The system is a method of study, but also a method of close association be- 
tween pupil and teacher. Intimate association—informal,- unforced, natural—is 
the only certain means of intellectual contagion. A rare oceasional man here 
and there may spread the contagion of mind and spirit which is the real power 
of the teacher by means of lectures and formal classroom exercises, * * * 
but the rest of us must be known and sampled in some everyday fashion of 
constant intercourse to be felt as comrades of the mind, to be recognized as 
persons whose influence can not easily be shaken off or forgotten. * * * 
Our preceptors are, almost without exception, men of unusual parts and of un- 
usual personality. They make themselves felt as men, as intellectual guides, as 
original thinkers and independent students of their subjects, and often also as 
friends and enjoyable companions. If they were not such men, vitality and 
reality would go out of the system at once. * * * If I had not what seems 
to me conclusive testimony to the effect that the preceptorial conferences have 
served these genuine and highest purposes of education, I would feel that I 
must report them useful, indeed, but a great disappointment. * * * 
It is outside the fields of drill, formal training, and occasional explanation 
that the preceptorial system has its proper application and its most noticeable 
and admirable results. * * * 
The system has accomplished no revolution in human nature; and it has not 
overcome the very serious impediments which exist in the present competitive 
social structure of our universities or in the extraordinary development among 
our undergraduates of activities of every sort which absorb their attention and 
divert their energies from their university work. Teacher and pupil do not 
live in the same atmosphere. * * * The undergraduate lives in a world in 
which other things than study take precedence of it as if of course. He turns 
aside from the things which chiefly engross him to have a brief conference with 
his preceptor about reading which lies remote from the ordinary courses of his
-P-A-G-E-81
  
HIGHER EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES. 61 
thought. And his preceptor can not be his companion in the matters which 
constitute his life. The one lives in one world, the other in another. They are 
not members of the same family or of the same social organism; and the rivalry 
between the life and work of the student generally results in the victory of the 
life. * * * Under our present university organization the preceptorial sys- 
tem can be carried only to the borders of the life of the place, not to its center ; 
and so long as this is the case its results, admirable as they have been, must dis- 
appoint us. * * * The system has approved itself and has had admirable 
results. We can by degrees give it better subject matter, better means, and full 
ranks of teachers. As soon as possible we must give it also an atmosphere to 
breathe. 
President Wilson’s approval of the scheme after five years of ex- 
perience is strongly confirmed by the opinion of preceptors and of 
the trustees, who have been responsible for the enormous increase in 
expenses involved in the system. 
Having in mind the same need of intercourse for the underclassmen 
especially, President A. Lawrence Lowell, of Harvard University, in 
his inaugural address in October, 1909, commented upon the naturally 
large waste of energy because of inadequate provision for the direc- 
tion of student interest and activity: 
The social relations of the undergraduates among themselves are quite as im- 
portant [as the intellectual relation of the students to one another]; and here 
again we may observe forces at work which tend to break up the old college 
solidarity. The boy comes here sometimes from a large school, with many 
friends, sometimes from a great distance and almost alone. He is plunged at 
once into a life wholly strange to him, amid a crowd so large that he can not 
claim acquaintance with its members. Unless endowed.with an uncommon 
temperament, he is liable to fall into a clique of associates with antecedents and 
_ characteristics similar to his own; or perhaps if shy and unknown, he fails to 
make friends at all; and in either case he misses the broadening influence of 
contact with a great variety of other young men. * * * The change from 
the life of school to that of college is too abrupt at the present day. Taken 
gradually, liberty is a powerful stimulant, but taken suddenly in large doses 
it is liable to act as an iutoxicant or an opiate. No doubt every boy ought to 
learn to paddle his own canoe; but we do not begin the process by tossing 
him into a canoe and setting him adrift in deep water with the caution that he 
would do well to look for the paddle. * * * It would seem that all these 
difficulties could be much lessened if the freshmen were brought together in 
a group of dormitories and dining halls, under the comradeship of older men 
who appreciated the possibilities of a college life and took a keen interest in 
their work and their pleasures. 
The new president of the State University of Iowa, a vigorous, ex- 
perienced, young alumnus of the institution, enters upon his task with 
full knowledge of the history and needs of his alma mater and with 
the frankest determination to lay especial stress upon this problem of 
the welfare of students rather than upon the problem of expansion, 
diversification of work, or the development of graduate instruction. 
To enable the students to find themselves through new measurements 
of their own powers and capacities, through contact with earnest, in- 
spiring advisors, and through touch with new elements of the world’s  
-P-A-G-E-82
    
62 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
thinking, and to enable them to make necessary adjustments and de- 
cisions as to future courses at the earliest possible moment, means not 
only the saving of time and money to the individual student, but it 
means to the university itself a more economical use of its energies, a 
clearing of its machinery of retarding elements, and the speedy elim- 
ination of the intellectually incorrigible or delinquent. 
From time to time during the past 20 years an approach to a solu- 
tion of this problem has been made through advisors, by which each 
student was more or less arbitrarily assigned to some member of the 
faculty, who was expected to combine the functions of friend, father 
confessor, and disciplinarian, who had to be consulted about certain 
matters, like programs, and who might be consulted about others. 
Few, if any, of these experiments proved really successful, and as one 
looks back upon them he is inclined to smile at the naiveté with which 
whole faculties voted to try a scheme so little cognizant of certain 
prejudices and indifferences of the average student. More recently 
several institutions, of which the University of California may be 
taken as a type, have developed a system of advisors upon a decidedly 
different plan. While the aim is substantially the same, namely, that 
of establishing friendly relations between a student and some instruc- 
tor, in the procedure lies the key to its success. Instead of arbitrarily 
assigning the student to some instructor, with the expectation that 
each member of the faculty might take his share of a more or less 
perfunctory and disagreeable task, a group of 25 young instructors is 
carefully selected, men who have direct dealings with freshmen or 
sophomores in their classes. To these men the chief advisor, on con- 
sultation with his men, or with the student, or with the principal of 
the school from which the student comes, makes such assignments as 
seem in his judgment likely to be most helpful to the student. After 
a year or two of experiment it was found advisable to make a small 
addition to the salary of the instructors serving in this new capacity, 
partly with a view to compensating them for the additional work in- 
volved and partly to recompense them for the expenditures which 
most of them felt it necessary to make in order to promote a friendly 
relation with their groups of students. Dean Hutchinson reports: 
The year’s experience seems to show that the system is really working. It 
is found that the students, although they sometimes do not seem very responsive 
when everything is running smoothly, yet, having made the personal acquaint- 
ance of an advisor, naturally turn to him when they get into any sort of 
difficulty. The reports of the advisors show that the aggregate numbers of 
meetings between students and advisors run up to several thousand for the 
first term of the academic year just closing. * * * The general feeling 
among the advisors is that the students show an increasing desire to meet 
them halfway. This is emphasized by the fact that a considerable number of 
upper-class students continue their personal relations with their advisors, 
although there is no formal attempt to maintain the system beyond the first 
year. Two or three things in particular have become increasingly apparent   
-P-A-G-E-83
  HIGHER EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES. 63 
concerning the future development of the system. The first of these is that 
the crux of the problem lies in the proper oversight of the freshmen. Nearly 
50 per cent of the students who get into serious difficulties of one sort or 
another are freshmen. The whole problem is chiefly concerned with pro- 
viding a gradual transition from the paternalism of the high school to the 
freedom of the university and guarding against the bewilderment and con- 
fusion of a too sudden plunge into the sundry distractions of college life. If 
this transition can be properly safeguarded during the student’s first year here, 
the remaining years may be left to take care of themselves. * * * To get 
the best results, the time must some day come when not merely a small group 
of instructors will be cultivating friendly, personal, human relations with their - 
students, but when it will be the general rule for all lower-division instructors 
(of the first two years), when one of the qualifications of the work of instruc- 
tion will be the desire and ability to be teachers in this more intimate sense. 
Much is continually said, and said with good basis of truth, con- * 
cerning the lack of religious instruction for students in State 
universities. Few members of the faculties of State universities 
would hesitate to admit that the lack of broadly religious instruction 
is a source of weakness in the State university organization. Very 
few, however, would advocate the introduction of such instruction 
into the curriculum of a State institution. In institutions like the 
University of Minnesota, located in large cities, and surrounded by 
powerful churches, very positive and helpful influences play upon 
large numbers of students, but the best efforts are still far short of 
meeting the needs of the institution. The movement, begun many 
years ago at the University of Michigan, for grouping about univer- 
sities dormitories, guild houses, or other church homes for the care 
of denominational groups of students has not made general progress. 
Around the University of Michigan there are the following guilds 
or other societies, whose chief object is to exert some religious in- 
fluence upon students: 
Hobart Guild, connected with St. Andrew’s, a Protestant Episcopal 
Church, has Harris Hall, with two endowed lectureships, one for 
the establishment and defense of Christian truth and one for 
Christian evidence; 
Tappan Presbyterian Association, with McMillan and Sackett Halls 
and a student pastor; : 
The Wesleyan Guild, with the Henry M. Loud lectureship ; 
The Baptist Students’ Guild, with Tucker Memorial Building, which 
is partly a students’ dormitory and partly a general meeting and 
recreation place. A full-time director is employed for student 
work; 
The Students’ Catholic Club. 
The Presbyterian Church, by authority of its General Assembly, 
has undertaken more systematically than any other denomination 
to supply the religious needs, particularly of Presbyterian students, 
in State universities and State colleges. In March, 1910, Dr. Richard  
-P-A-G-E-84
  64 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
C. Hughes, lately president of Ripon College, was placed in charge 
of this form of religious work. It should be noted that this is not 
merely a movement for the support of the local Presbyterian Church 
near a State university. The student pastor appointed under the 
direction of the board of education of the church in cooperation 
with the local synod devotes his whole time to promoting the welfare 
of students of his denomination. At the University of Illinois, for 
example, there are 760 students affiliated with the Presbyterian 
_ Church; $60,000 has been raised for an endowment for the university 
church, and nearly $40,000 is subscribed for the construction of the 
building and its equipment. In similar manner endeavor is made 
to provide for the Presbyterian students in the Universities of Kan- 
sas, Michigan, Wisconsin, Nebraska, Colorado, Iowa, and Arkansas. 
Adjacent to the University of California the Catholic Church has 
constructed a large and beautiful building for housing its student 
activities; at the University of Wisconsin, opposite the campus, in 
connection with the new university church, a Catholic house has 
recently been opened. j 
Among the most important existing agencies for student welfare 
must be mentioned the college Young Men’s Christian Association 
and Young Women’s Christian Association, so generally established 
throughout the country. Disconnected organically from the organi- 
zation of the State institutions, they perform many highly desirable 
functions, both social and instructional as well as religious, not yet 
undertaken by State institutions themselves. At least one of these 
associations, that at the University of North Dakota, admits to full 
membership both Universalists and Catholics, as well as persons 
identified with other denominations. Alongside or in connection 
with 35 State universities one or both of these associations appear. 
While in some cases the associations receive the use of rooms in 
university buildings for their work, several of them own very hand- 
some buildings of their own. Madison Hall, at the University of 
Virginia, costing $75,000, and the great association buildings at the 
University of Illinois, the University of Wisconsin, and the Uni- 
versity of California, all located on the campus or adjacent to it, are 
evidences of the great immediate helpfulness of these semiaffiliated 
organizations. 
In many instances the university contributes directly to the sup- 
port of the work of the associations, not for its religious work 
but for services rendered in connection with the social welfare of 
the students, in providing helpful agencies for securing rooms or 
employment, or in maintaining a common meeting place under whole- 
some conditions. These grants by the authorities of State universi- 
ties take the form of free rent, heat, and light, contributions toward 
the cost of useful student handbooks, and payments toward secre- 
taries’ salaries. The University of Illinois, for example, contributes
-P-A-G-E-85
  HIGHER EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES, 65 
to the handbook $100, the University of Iowa and the University of 
Oklahoma each pay $400 toward secretaries’ salaries. The State of 
Arkansas in 1909 appropriated $750 toward the maintenance of the 
Young Men’s Christian Association, and a like sum for the Young 
Women’s Christian Association. The Clemson (State) Agricultural 
College of South Carolina goes even further. The board of trustees, 
according to its Twenty-first Annual Report, makes an annual appro- 
priation of $3,000 “ for carrying on the religious work of the college; 
$500 is paid on the salary of the four resident ministers, representing 
the Baptist, Episcopal, Methodist, and Presbyterian denominations; 
$500 is used to bring to Clemson ministers of other Protestant denomi- 
nations not represented by the resident ministers, and $500 is paid 
toward the salary of the resident Young Men’s Christian Association 
secretary, who lives in the barracks and works with the students.”

INTRODUCTION. 
Without question the year 1911 was productive of more educa- 
tional legislation of value than any previous year in the history of 
the Nation. Forty-three legislatures' were in session, and in all of 
them, practically without exception, an attitude of marked friendli- 
ness was shown to the cause of public education. 
The public-school system no longer occupies a place of minor im- 
portance in the deliberations of legislative bodies, and the chair- 
manship of a committee on education now offers opportunities for 
distinction and effective work that are not excelled. No figure was 
more conspicuous in the Pennsylvania Legislature in the last session 
than Senator Tustin, and none was more prominent in New Jersey 
than Senator Frelinghuysen; and so it was generally. Education is 
recognized as the greatest work of the State and leadership in its 
affairs is eagerly sought by men of the highest type. 
The past year was one of peace, prosperity, and unusual freedom 
from political strife—West Virginia and Tennessee were the only 
States in which political differences reached an acute stage. The 
general conditions, therefore, were favorable, for there was no over- 
shadowing interest to distract popular attention; the time was ripe

for substantial educational advances; able men were ready for their 
advocacv, and the results are apparent upon the statute books as the 
high-water mark of legislative achievement in behalf of education. 
GENERAL LAWS. 
Pennsylwania.—The passage of the new school code of Pennsylvania 
is one of the most significant events in education in recent years. 
The Pennsylvania school system was the growth of more than a 
century; no general revision had ever been made, and there were in 
actual effect more than 200 general laws and nearly 2,000 special acts, 
some of which dated from the first years of the nineteenth century. 
The system that thus developed by gradual accretion was like a 
rambling farmhouse, serving well its purpose in many respects, but 
loosely hung together, without unity of design, inconvenient, often 
difficult to understand and to use, and ill-adapted to the application 
of improvements which modern investigation and experience have 
proved to be desirable. Notwithstanding its shortcomings, the old 
familiar structure was a part of the life of the people, and they were 
loath to see it demolished. But a new organization has been erected, 
in which are incorporated many of the old substantial timbers; 
it is essentially new, in that its parts have been rearranged, its 
redundancies and superfluities have been eliminated, and new fea- 
tures have been introduced to give it unity and harmony and to bring 
it in line with the best modern ideas in school organization. 
The code is a model of constructive legislation; but its successful 
enactment was due not only to its internal excellence but to the 
intelligent persistence with which the people of the State were ad- 
dressed practically without cessation for four years, and to the skill 
with which an overwhelming public sentiment was aroused in its 
favor. 
One of its most significant changes relates to the organization of 
school districts. The entire system of independent districts under 
special laws is abolished, and the districts are now classified accord- 
ing to population, each class being governed by uniform laws. Ex- 
isting civil subdivisions, cities, incorporated towns, boroughs, and 
townships, are the units of organization, but the lines may be changed 
by prescribed methods to make ‘independent districts.” This 
term, however, refers merely to the fact that such a district is not 
coextensive with any other civil subdivision, and the laws relating to 
independent districts are the same as those governing other districts 
of the same population. 
The creation of a State board of education appears to be an inno- 
vation of importance, but the provisions relating to it are such that 
it has little independent power. Its functions are not clearly differ- 
entiated from those of the superintendent of public instruction, and 
 
-P-A-G-E-89
  
EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION IN 1911. 69 
it is apparently expected that the latter official will be the ruling 
force in the board of which he is president. Provision is made for 
a State school fund, such as exists in some form in nearly every other 
State. This fund and its income are to be under the control of the 
new State board of education, and apparently will furnish not only 
one of the most important reasons for the existence of that body 
but the only regular means for the maintenance of its operations. 
A change of undoubted significance is that which contemplates 
the gradual acquisition by the State of the so-called State normal 
schools, of which there are 13. These are now local or stock-company 
schools, receiving State recognition and aid and some State super- 
vision. Even the schools that are not acquired and operated directly 
by State officers will in future be subject to a larger degree of State 
control than in the past. 
Idaho also has a new body of school laws, enacted at the session 
of the legislature which recently adjourned. It was the work of a 
commission created by legislative authority, and but few amendments, 
and these of minor character, were made by either branch of the 
legislature. The need of improvement in Idaho was more than 
usually manifest, for the old laws were plainly defective and in- 
congruous, and were difficult of construction and enforcement. 
The revision was well done in the main, and the changes made were 
judicious and well considered, though neither radical nor extensive 
as compared with some other recent measures of the same character. 
Conspicuous among the changes are (1) the increased responsi- 
bility of the State board of education, and the transfer to it of many 
of the duties formerly performed by the State superintendent; (2) 
the formation of a new class of districts with enlarged powers and 
greater independence; (3) a graduated scale for the length of school 
term and increased requirements as to length in the more populous 
districts; (4) changed plan of apportionment of school moneys by 
county superintendents; (5) an improved system of certification of 
teachers; (6) changed constitution of boards of trustees of rural 
high schools and the requirement that manual training, elementary 
agriculture, and domestic science be taught in such schools; (7) re- 
quirement that rules and regulations formulated by the State board 
of education shall be observed in the construction of schoolhouses. 
Nevada.—A code prepared, largely by a committee of the State 
Teachers’ Institute was adopted by the legislature. Though it was_ 
a complete code, it did not erect a new system but did make important 
modifications in the system as it then existed. A characteristic 
feature of the Nevada organization is the absence of county superin- 
tendents; instead of this official, the 15 counties are arranged in 
districts, in each of which is a ‘deputy superintendent of public 
instruction.” The authority of these officers is largely increased by 
   
-P-A-G-E-90
    
70 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911, 
the new law, and many of the minor functions formerly assigned to 
the State superintendent are now given to them. Under the present 
organization the success or failure of the schools depends in a pre- 
eminent degree upon the efficiency of the deputy superintendents, 
The State tax rate is nearly doubled, the minimum county tax is 
raised from 1.5 to 2 mills, and the method of apportionment is 
changed, plainly for the better. The certificating system is recast, 
and all except temporary certificates are issued by State authority. 
North Dakota.—A striking example of the mobility of the law in 
some of the western communities is afforded in North Dakota, where at 
the same session of the legislature a strong commission of 10 members 
was created to study educational systems and to present a report 
which will form a basis for unifying and harmonizing the educa- 
tional system of the State, and, apparently within a few days, an 
extensive bill was passed revising and codifying the entire school 
Jaw and repealing all existing provisions upon the subject. The report 
of the commission, accompanied by a bill, must be presented in 
December, 1912, and will be considered at the legislative session 
of 1913. 
The new code, whose expectation of life is but two years, makes 
but few changes that are not of minor character. A new system of 
certification of teachers is provided; the sections relating to the 
organization of districts are redrawn; the plan of determining the 
compensation of county superintendents is changed; a month is 
added to the minimum school year; the period of compulsory at- 
tendance and of free attendance is increased, and other useful but 
not radical differences appear. 
South Dakota also was the scene of a campaign for anew code during 
the year. A joint committee on legislation was appointed by the 
three leading associations of school officials and teachers, and a plan 
of organization was drawn which seemed to its supporters to be 
ideal as an educational system comprising all grades and classes of 
schools and institutions for instruction. Vigorous efforts were made 
to secure the adoption of the measure, but it was in advance of 
popular sentiment and was rejected by a decisive vote in the house 
in which it was introduced. 
Arkansas.—The South, too, has felt the influence of the movement 
for school-law reform. In Arkansas a bill to create a commission to 
investigate the needs of the State school system failed to pass the 
legislature of 1909. The Southern Education Board, however, pro- 
vided the necessary funds, and the governor appointed a commission 
of 20 representative citizens under the chairmanship of the superin- 
tendent of public instruction. This body adopted a plan of procedure 
different from that followed in other States, and though they expect 
to finally cover with their recommendations practically the entire
-P-A-G-E-91
  
EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION IN 1911. val 
field of education, they do not anticipate the preparation of a com- 
plete code at one time. The three improvements that seemed most 
urgently needed were: (1) A State board of education; (2) State 
aid to high schools; and (3) the consolidation of rural schools. 
Three measures were accordingly drawn embodying the ideas of the 
commission with reference to these subjects, and by vigorous efforts 
all of them passed. Marked improvement in the educational con- 
' ditions of the State is confidently expected to result. 
The fruition of the labors of the South Carolina school-code com- 
mission created in 1910 has been deferred, but it is understood that the 
conditions are favorable for the final adoption of the measures they 
recommend. The proposed code was favorably reported to both 
houses, but the time was not sufficient for consideration, and the 
session closed without action. 
Tennessce.—In Tennessee a well-considered general school bill 
amounting to a code was presented to the legislature and was favor- 
ably received, but disturbed political conditions prevented action 
upon it. The bill was prepared by a committee of the State School 
Officers’ Association and financial aid was rendered by the Southern 
Education Board. 
The original act establishing the Tennessee school system was 
passed in 1873, and many supplementary laws have been enacted 
since. Inevitably, many of the latter have become obsolete; others 
are now indaequate for the needs of the system as it has developed, 
and frequent contradictions occur in the provisions of different laws 
in full effect. The need of improvement is evident. The aim of the 
committee was ‘‘to harmonize the old and to provide such amend- 
ments as are most needed for the effective operation of the present 
system.” 
Notwithstanding the failure of the general bill, the session of 1911 
rendered a great service by the passage of an act authorizing the 
issue of county bonds for the construction of schoolhouses. Here- 
tofore such construction has been necessarily upon a cash basis from 
current funds, for there was no means of utilizing the common and 
effective device of extending payments over a series of years. The 
new law appears to be imperfect in certain particulars, but its benefit 
should be immediate and widespread. 
Illinois.—The educational commission of Illinois, which has been 
in existence since 1907, has again been continued. It presented a 
report to the forty-seventh general assembly which was devoted 
largely to the recommendations of a special committee on industrial 
education. The commission itself, however, presented three bills 
which were modifications of similar measures included in its recom- 
mendations to the forty-sixth general assembly, namely: (1) To 
create a State board of education; (2) to prescribe a uniform system 
 
-P-A-G-E-92
  12 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
of certification of teachers; (8) to increase the State appropriation 
for schools from $1,000,000 to $4,500,000. None of these bills passed, 
but the State appropriation for schools was increased to $2,000,000. 
Montana is the latest State to undertake the general revision and 
codification of its school laws, and a commission has recently been 
created by authority of the legislature for that purpose. 
Each of the States enumerated in the foregoing paragraphs has 
enacted or proposed to enact an entire educational code, by which 
all previous laws on the subject were wiped out and a new body of 
laws was enacted in their stead. In other States, however, changes 
just as vital have been made without such comprehensive action, 
for mere revision and codification is in itself not a radical process, 
although it is customary to insert, if possible, desired improvements 
when such an opportunity as a general overhauling of laws is presented. 
Georgia, New Jersey, and Delaware are perhaps the States in which 
the most important action not amounting to complete revision has 
been taken during the year. 
Georgia.—The new law of Georgia is indeed entitled ‘‘An act to 
reyise the school laws of the State of Georgia,” and in its importance 
to the State it is worthy of rank with any law that has been enacted 
within the decade; but it is limited in its scope and can scarcely be 
rated as a code comparable with that of Pennsylvania. 
The agitation for a-reform of the school system of Georgia has 
extended over the past five years, and the State Teachers’ Association, 
the Conference for Education in the South, and the Association of 
County School Commissioners have all had a conspicuous part in it. 
Repeatedly within that time bills in the interest of the schools have 
failed of passage by the legislature, apparently because the public 
sentiment of the State had not sufficiently crystallized in favor of 
progressive action; but in every instance it was evident that the 
efforts made were producing good results, and that the public-school 
system was growing rapidly in popular favor. 
The legislative session of 1911 saw the final success of the move- 
ment, and a bill was passed which incorporated all the essential 
improvements desired by the educational organizations, and gave 
to Georgia a school system that will compare favorably in its structure 
with any State school organization in the country. The new law is 
a model of brevity and of clearness; it contains only 24 short para- 
graphs, and they leave little opportunity for misunderstanding. Its 
provisions do not apply to cities containing over 100,000 inhabitants 
(Atlanta only) or to certain county districts, and it does not interfere 
with the many specially incorporated local systems except in relation 
to the licensing of teachers; but it will reach beneficially the schools 
that are in the greatest need of improvement, namely, those in rural 
communities.
-P-A-G-E-93
  
EDUCATIONAL: LEGISLATION IN 1911. 73. 
The State board of education, formerly a group of State officials, 
is now a professional body of importance. They will formulate rules 
and regulations and prescribe courses of study and a list of text- 
books for the use of all common and high schools receiving State aid, 
but they may in their discretion modify the State courses and book 
list to meet the peculiar needs of individual localities. ‘The board 
of education will be the final court of appeals in all controversies 
relating to the schools; they must provide teachers’ institutes in 
each county, and may compel the attendance of all teachers; they 
must provide for the examination, and licensing of teachers, and no per- 
son may teach in any school in the State without a license granted 
under the authority of the board. The board, however, may delegate 
to local municipal authorities the right to license teachers, and may 
revoke such delegation if the local system should fail to maintain a 
high standard. 
The office of State school commissioner is superseded by that of 
State superintendent of schools, and the authority and salary of the 
office are increased. County boards of education are retained with 
enlarged powers; the professional qualifications of county superin- 
tendents (title changed from county school commissioners) are 
raised, and their minimum. compensation is fixed at $600 per annum. 
New Jersey.—The recent important legislation in New Jersey was 
largely the outcome of a legislative investigation initiated in 1909, 
the State board of education cooperating. The investigation was 
thorough, and disclosed in many instances what the committee con- 
sidered weaknesses requiring legislative action. Twenty-three bills 
were presented, covering a wide range of subjects, the most important 
of them relating to the State board of education and the State super- 
intendent. The abrogation of both these was recommended, their 
place to be taken by a commissioner of education with large powers. 
The suggestion to abolish the State board failed to find general favor, 
and was abandoned, but a radical change was made in the size and 
composition of the board. As finally passed the bill provided for a 
nonpartisan board of eight members, their full terms being eight 
years; and for a commissioner of education to be appointed by the 
governor. No restriction is placed upon the governor in the selection 
of the commissioner, and the first appointee was a resident of another 
State, an unusual occurrence in itself. Two others of the chief State 
school officers now in office had not been identified prior to their 
appointment with the States they servé, and another had for a number 
of years been in educational work in other States. Such a practice 
is not wholly of recent origin, for Henry Barnard served both Con- 
necticut and Rhode Island in the same capacity; city school boards   
1 He was secretary of the Board of School Commissioners of Connecticut from 1838 to 1842, was State 
school commissioner of Rhode Island from 1843 to 1849, and was State superintendent of schools of Con- 
necticut from 1850 to 1854 
   
-P-A-G-E-94
  74 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
have long been accustomed to disregard the accidents of birth and of 
residence in the selection of superintendents; but it is nevertheless 
- highly significant of the broadening tendencies in education that even 
in a few instances the highest State school officer has been brought 
from afar, and that laws have recently been passed in several States 
removing wholly or in part the former restrictions in the qualifica- 
tions of county superintendents with respect to residence. 
The New Jersey commissioner will receive $10,000 per annum, the 
highest salary paid to any American State school officer,’ and his 
powers are exceeded only by those of the corresponding officer in 
New York. 
West Virginia.—The recognition which was given to the needs of 
education by the last West Virginia Legislature is a source of gratifi- 
cation to the school men of the State. Notwithstanding acute 
political controversies that broke the continuity of the session, no 
other legislature in the history of the State has done so much for 
education, and the result is described by the State superintendent as 
‘an education renaissance.” With the exception of four bills which 
were not reached, all the laws asked by the school authorities were 
passed. They related to State aid to district high schools, teachers’ 
certificates, bonds for building purposes, medical inspection, and to 
many local matters of prime importance to the communities con- 
cerned. In addition, the appropriations to all lines of educational 
work were materially increased. 
Alabama.—Favorable reports were received from Alabama also, 
notwithstanding the failure of the most important measure presented. 
The greatest desideratum in that State is proper provision for local 
taxation. There is no legal authority whatever for a district school 
tax, except in incorporated towns and cities. In certain cases, as that 
relating to the construction of schoolhouses, the law requires con- 
tributions from districts in order to secure State aid, but such con- 
tributions must necessarily be raised wholly by private subscription; 
there is no other way. The county school tax is limited to 1 mill, 
and even that can not be levied except with the approval of three- 
fifths of those voting at an election. About one-third of the counties 
levy no school tax. The constitution of the State is responsible for 
this condition, and the remedy must be in an amendment to that 
instrument. A vigorous campaign was inaugurated early in 1911 
with this end in view. The proposition passed the house of repre- 
sentatives by an overwhelming majority, but failed in the senate by 
a single vote. 
In other respects the action of the legislature was entirely satis- 
factory, and several of the laws passed were ‘‘of inestimable value” 
in the opinion of tho State superintendent of education. The most

expenses of travel on official business.

EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION IN 1911. 95 
important of them related to the county superintendent, increasing 
the professional qualifications required, prescribing his duties, in 
supervision more clearly, and relieving him of the necessity of acting 
as disbursing officer to the teachers. The certification law was 
beneficially amended, and more adequate provision was made for insti- 
tutes. The control of all State normal schools for white students 
was centered in a single board, and the standards of those schools 
will be raised. Appropriations for common schools, rural school- 
houses, school libraries, high schools, agricultural schools, and the 
higher institutions were materially increased. 
Delaware will in all probability have within a few years at most a 
plan of organization similar to that of the States about her. A 
special commission was constituted by the legislature in 1909 to 
investigate the public-school system. They presented a report in 
February, 1911, stating that amendments to the existing laws would 
give at best but partial relief, and that the only permanent remedy 
for prevailing unsatisfactory conditions would be in an entirely new 
code of school laws. As the best means of procedure they recom- 
mended the reorganization of the State board of education and an 
enlargement of its powers, with authority to prepare a suitable code 
for submission to the legislature at its next session. This course was 
adopted. The authority given to the new board is extensive, and, 
considering the high character of the members appointed, it may be 
expected that marked improvement will result, even if the con- 
templated code should fail.. There seems to be every prospect of a 
favorable outcome to the situation. 
Arizona.—In their provisions concerning education the consti- 
tutions of Arizona and New Mexico are constructed along familiar 
lines. The Arizona constitution requires the legislature to establish 
a general and uniform public-school system, including kindergartens, 
common schools, high schools, normal schools, industrial schools, 
special schocls, and higher institutions. The conduct and super- 
vision of the public-school system will be vested in a State board of 
education, a State superintendent of public instruction, county 
superintendents, and such governing boards for State institutions 
as may be provided bylaw. The superintendent of public instruction 
and the county superintendents are to be elected by popular vote for 
two-year terms. Provision is made for a permanent State school 
fund derived from the sale of public lands and miscellaneous sources. 
The income from such fund with other State school moneys shail be 
apportioned to the counties on the basis of pupils of school age. 
Sectarian instruction and religious and political tests are forbidden, 
and the labor of children is restricted. The legislature may prescribe 
the qualifications of voters at school elections. 
New Mexico.—The New Mexico instrument is somewhat more 
comprehensive than the other, and,-in addition to provisions similar  
-P-A-G-E-96
a ga a a eee 
716 " EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
to the foregoing, prescribes the qualifications of the superintendent 
of public instruction; permits women to vote at school elections and 
to hold county and local school offices; directs that a reserve fund 
be retained from the apportionment of the State current school fund, 
and that reserve fund be used to aid weak districts to maintain at 
least a five months’ school term, and requires that compulsory school 
attendance and State uniformity of textbooks be provided by the 
legislature. 
Indiana.—A new constitution has been drawn in Indiana, and will 
be submitted to the voters of the State at the general election in 
November, 1912. The only change that it makes in the educational 
provisions of the constitution of 1851 is that it extends the term of 
the State superintendent of public instruction from two to four 
years. The legislature is required to provide a general and uniform 
system of common schools, but, except for the provision of a State 
superintendent. none of the details of the contemplated system are 
prescribed. : 
It is both interesting and significant to thus contrast the general 
expressions and the brevity of the fundamental law of one of the 
typical older States with the relative minuteness of that of the two 
latest additions to the Union. 
New constitutions are contemplated for Ohio and New Hampshire 
also, and in each of those States the legislature has provided for a 
convention to draft the instrument. 
STATE SCHOOL OFFICERS AND BOARDS. 
Some of the most important enactments under this title were dis- 
cussed in the foregoing paragraphs, namely, those relating to the 
State boards of education of Arkansas, Delaware, Georgia, New Jer- 
sey, and Pennsylvania, since these were intimately connected with 
legislation of general character. 
The most important separate act of the year that involves a State 
administrative authority concerned with education is undoubtedly 
that reorganizing the board of education of Oklahoma. This marks 
a departure from all laws previously enacted in that it assigns to a 
single body direct and complete control over all the educational 
agencies of the State, from the primary school to the university, 
excepting only the agricultural schools and college. 
Other State boards, that of Washington representing the type, 
have supervision of higher institutions as well as of common schools, 
but the higher institutions are managed directly by separate boards 
of regents or trustees. 
In still other States, the board of education, so called, controls all 
the higher institutions, as in Iowa; or the State normal schools, as 
in Michigan, without intermediate boards of trustees; but they have 
little or no relation with other institutions or with the common
-P-A-G-E-97
  EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION IN 1911, 17 
schools. In several cases boards of control have been created to 
administer all the eleemosynary and penal institutions of their 
respective States.. But the extent of the authority of the board of 
education of Oklahoma exceeds them all. It is the legal successor 
of no less than 14 abolished boards, and has all the powers, rights, 
and privileges formerly exercised by all of them. 
Furthermore, it has the following additional powers and duties: 
(1) To have the general supervision of the public schools of the State. 
(2) To prescribe courses of study for the common schools, county 
normal institutes, reading circles, and the higher educational insti- 
tutions. (3) To formulate rules and regulations governing the 
issuance of teachers’ certificates, and prepare questions for the exami- 
nation of applicants for county and city certificates. (4) To exam- 
ine applicants for State teachers’ certificates, and for institute con- 
ductors’ and teachers’ certificates. (5) To prepare questions for 
graduation from the eighth grade. (6) To classify and accredit high 
schools. (7) To prepare reports and budgets. (8) Upon the appli- 
cation of the organization representing the business schools of the 
State, to prescribe rules and regulations to govern such schools. 
There is a motive for every human action, and the excess of parti- 
san politics in the previous management of educational affairs in the 
State furnished the motive in this case. In selecting the members 
of the new board the governor chose men of high character, repre- 
senting both the leading political parties, though he was not required 
by the law to do so. His instructions to them were remarkable for 
their strength and candor, and he emphatically warned them that 
no political consideration would be permitted to influence their offi- 
cial actions in any particular. 
In Utah the duties of the State board of education have been 
enlarged by the transfer to it of the functions of the State library- 
gymnasium commission, which is accordingly abolished. An arrange- 
ment, which is perhaps unique, is reported from Oregon, in which the 
members of the State board of education are made individually ex 
officio members of the board of regents of the State University. 
The tendency toward centralization in administration is further 
illustrated by the creation in Ohio and North Dakota of boards of 
control to direct all State charitable and reformatory institutions. 
In North Dakota the State penitentiary is also placed under the 
same board. In Nebraska a constitutional amendment to the same 
effect has been proposed by the legislature for adoption by the people. 
Similar but less extensive consolidation has been effected in Maine, 
the institutions concerned being the school for the feeble-minded and 
‘the two State hospitals for the insane. 
An important law was enacted in Hawaii in April, 1911, affecting 
the powers of the Territorial department of public instruction in 
relation to school moneys. A commission was created at the legis-
-P-A-G-E-98
  
78 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911, 
lative session of 1909 to investigate methods of raising and appor- 
tioning school funds, and the law mentioned was the result of their 
labors. The salary schedule for all teachers, supervisors, and prin- 
cipals in the islands will hereafter be prepared by the department of 
public instruction, and, when approved by the governor and pub- 
lished, it will have the effect of law. A biennial budget must be pre- 
pared by the department and submitted to the legislature for its 
action, after consideration by a board of estimate composed of speci- 
fied officials, and then by the governor. All revenues derived from 
school taxes must be appropriated for the support of schools in the 
respective counties in which they are raised, in the manner provided 
by the salary schedule and the budget, and the legislature shall 
appropriate from the revenues from property taxes such an addi- 
tional amount as may be necessary to meet the aggregate of such 
schedule and budget. 
COUNTY BOARDS AND OFFICERS. 
If it were asked what officers in the school organization are as a 
class in the position to exert the greatest power for good to the schools 
at large, the reply must be, the county superintendents and those 
performing like service. Unfortunately, however, the importance 
of this office has not been universally recognized in the past, and it is 
one of the most encouraging of recent developments that the position 
is receiving more of the attention that it must have before the school 
system can reach its highest efficiency. Election by the people is 
the method of selection ordained in many of the State constitutions, 
and in a few of them reelection more than once is forbidden. Neither 
provision is calculated to produce the most efficient service, and the 
tendency is to eliminate them, if possible. 
Constitutional amendments have been proposed during the year 
in two States, Minnesota and Washington, both tending to elevate 
the office. In the first, the legislature is empowered to determine 
the qualifications of county superintendents, and in the second the 
limitation of incumbency to two terms is removed. In other States 
an attempt is made to remove the evils of popular election by so 
fixing the qualifications for eligibility that only experienced teachers 
and competent administrators can be chosen. Material increase in 
salaries in 2 number of States discloses the effort to attract a higher 
class of men than it has been possible heretofore to secure in many 
instances. 
In Indiana, a State already blessed with a corps of county officers 
far above the average of efficiency, the necessary qualifications are 
again increased, and all the superintendents are put upon a more 
satisfactory salary basis. Heretofore they received $4.50 for each day 
of actual service, but by the act of March 2, 1911, the uniform rate
-P-A-G-E-99
EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION IN 1911. 19 
of $1,408.50, with $100 additional for travel, is fixed for all except a 
few in the smaller counties. 
In Kansas the miaximum allowed under the general law was for- 
merly $1,200, but the new schedule enacted in March provides that 
in counties of over 70,000 inhabitants the superintendent shall 
receive $1,800 per annum. Other salaries are graded in proportion 
to the school population of the several counties, with $1 per annum 
additional for each teacher, a general increase being the result. 
Another law provides that if the county commissioners are unable 
to fill a vacancy from residents in the county, the State superinten- 
dent of public instruction shall appoint a legally qualified person, a 
resident of Kansas, regardless of the county of his residence. 
The maximum salary in Michigan was $1,800 under the old law, 
but by the act of April 26, 1911, the minimum in counties having 
over 300 schoolrooms was fixed at $2,000, and in other counties the 
minimum varies from $1,500 to $500, according to the number of 
rooms, the lowest minimum being for counties with less than 50 
schoolrooms. 
The constitutional amendment proposed in Minnesota for the 
purpose of raising the professional standard of the county superin- 
tendency has already been mentioned. Coincident with this propo- 
sition are increases of 25 and 50 per cent in the minimum scale, with 
authority to any county board to fix tho salary at more than $2,000 
if they so determine. 
A substantial increase is reported from Nebraska also, and in that 
State the minimum in any county with 1,500 children of school age 
is $1,000, with higher salaries in more populous counties; counties 
with 15,000 or more children must pay at least $2,200. 
An increase is contemplated in Utah, but in this case the method 
adopted was to raise the legal maximum, that being fixed at $2,000 
in counties of the first class, and at from $500 to $1,500 in the less 
populous counties. As in other States, these increased salaries are 
accompanied by raised professional qualifications. 
Tn West Virginia $200 per annum has been added to the salary of 
each county superintendent, and there, also, the standard of qualifi- 
cations is raised. 
The new code of Pennsylvania provides for the payment to county 
superintendents of not less than $1,500 and not over $2,000 by the 
State, and authorizes the respective counties to increase those 
amounts from county school funds. Assistants are provided in the 
more populous counties at $1,200 from State funds, with like authority 
for additional compensation from county funds. 
In North Dakota the basis of compensation is changed from the 
number of teachers to the assessed valuation, and the maximum is 
fixed at $2,000 for counties with an assessment of over $9,000,000, 
the minimum in any county being $500.  
-P-A-G-E-100
  
80 ' EDUCATION REPORT, 1911, 
In some of the Southern States, also, action has been taken toward 
the improvement of the status of the county superintendents, though 
naturally the rates of compensation are lower in that. section. In 
Georgia at least $450 a year must be paid to thése officers as salary 
and $150 for travel. In Arkansas their compensation has been 
increased by allowing them to retain certain fees, and in South 
Carolina the code which failed to pass provided for salaries of $1,200. 
In New Jersey the uniform salary of all county superintendents is 
$2,000, the entire sum being paid by the State. A bill to increase 
this to $3,000 failed, but another bill did pass which requires the 
proper county officers to appropriate not over $600 annually for 
clerical assistance. Like provision for assistance, though not neces- 
‘sarily of equal amount, has marked the legislation of several of the 
States, including Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, and Oklahoma. 
A noteworthy law which should be mentioned in connection with 
the general subject of county supervision is that of Oregon, which pro- 
vides that in each county containing more than 60 school districts 
the county superintendent shall appoint a county educational board, 
who, in turn, shall divide the county into supervision districts con- 
taining from 20 to 50 schools and shall employ a supervisor for each 
at not less than $1,000 per annum, such supervisors to act under the 
direction of the county superintendent. 
SCHOOL FINANCE. 
A bill of 16 lines, unobtrusive in appearance and modest in phrase- 
ology, was introduced in the Massachusetts General Court in January, 
1911, which, if it becomes a law, will cause the greatest change in 
educational practices and the most complete reversal of traditions 
that have ever been witnessed in any State of the Union. It is 
entitled “An act to provide that the expense of maintaining the pri- 
mary, grammar, and high schools in the cities and towns of the Com- 
monwealth shall be borne by the Commonwealth.” The body of the 
bill contained but little more than was included in the title, except 
that it provided that the expense should be assessed upon the respec- 
tive cities and towns as a State tax, upon the basis of taxable valua- 
tion of real and personal property. The measure, revolutionary as 
it was, accompanied a petition of the mayor of the city of Everett and 
others, and was ‘‘reported’’ by the house committee on education. 
And this was in a State so wedded to local self-government that not 
even the qualifications of a teacher for a certificate are prescribed by 
State authority. 
The bill did not pass, but a ‘‘resolve” was adopted directing the 
State board of education to investigate the prevailing methods of 
distribution between the local communities and the Commonwealth 
of the cost of public education and to report thereon with recom-
-P-A-G-E-101
EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION IN 1911. 81 
mendations as to such changes as seem to be demanded in the interest 
of economy and sound educational policy. 
There is now no State school tax in Massachusetts, and appropria- 
tions from general funds for certain specific purposes amount to only 
about $250,000. The cities and towns raise over $18,000,000, and 
the contribution of the State is a negligible quantity in actual amount, 
although the use made of it is such that it exerts an influence far 
beyond its cash value. It is more than probable that the bill men- 
tioned, extreme though it was, may, by causing an examination 
of the entire question and by stimulating discussion, result in im- 
portant modifications of the traditional policy of the State in school 
maintenance. 
This occurrence in the most conservative of all the States in many 
respects is additional evidence of the tendency that is general toward 
a larger degree of centralization in maintenance as well as in control. 
Other evidences may be found in the following: The State school 
tax was increased from 0.6 mill to 1 mill in Nevada; a constitutional 
amendment was proposed for popular approval in Oklahoma extend- 
ing the authority of the legislature to levy taxes to aid common 
schools; a special tax of 0.5 mill was levied for high schools in Utah; 
the appropriation in lieu of a 2-mill tax was doubled in Illinois; 
$250,000 was added to the usual appropriation in Alabama, and 
large increases are reported from practically all the States. 
These increases are not all in the general distributive funds of the 
respective States, but in many cases they are for school buildings, 
supervision, consolidated schools, State graded schools, high schools, 
industrial training, agricultural instruction, and for other special pur- 
poses. But the result is the same—the proportion of school expense 
which the State bears steadily tends to increase. 
Tax laws of Ohio—The financial situation in Ohio seems to be 
complex and somewhat uncertain. Considering only the text of the 
laws passed at the session of 1911, it might appear that Ohio is an 
exception to the statement regarding increased State contributions 
to education, for the tax rate for the common school fund is fixed at 
0.335 mill mstead of 1 mill, as formerly. It is true that for several 
years there has been a strong protest from the wealthier counties in 
each successive legislature against the 1-mill tax, and it has narrowly 
escaped repeal on more than one occasion; but this particular reduc- 
tion is due to a difference in the basis of assessment and is more 
apparent than real. It was expected that the grand list of the State 
on the valuation of 1910 would be approximately three times as great 
as before, and that a levy of 0.335 mill would produce as much as the 
former 1-mill tax. The actual appropriation for 1911 and 1912 for 
the common-school fund was at the same rate as for 1910; namely, 
13144°—xp 1911—vou 1——6

$2 for each enumerated youth. It transpired, however, that the 
rates fixed by the tax law of 1911 (known popularly as the Smith 1 
per cent tax law, officially as House bill No. 186) would not produce 
enough by approximately $500,000 to meet the appropriations for 
the common school fund, irreducible debt fund, and for the higher 
institutions. But with the law described there was passed to meet 
| such a contingency an ‘‘enabling act,’ which provides that any 
deficiencies that may occur shall be paid from the ‘‘general revenue 
fund’”’ of the State. No loss, therefore, will occur to either of the 
educational funds mentioned so far as the State levy in concerned+ 
The ultimate possibilities of the same law (House bill No. 186) 
concerning the proceeds of local taxes, however, seem to be more 
doubtful. It provides that the maximum rate of tax upon any prop- 
erty shall not exceed 10 mills; that the aggregate of county taxes 
shall not exceed 3 mills; of township taxes, 2 mills; of local school 
taxes, 5 mills? Estimates of the several boards of each county shall 
be submitted to a county budget commission, and, if the aggregate of 
the estimates exceeds the legal maximum, the budget commission 
shall revise the estimates and may reduce any item thereof to bring 
the total within the proper limit. The maximum local tax for com- 
mon schools was formerly 12 mills, but that might have been increased 
to 17 mills by popular vote, and additional taxes were authorized for 
compulsory education, manual training, special teachers, and high 
schools. It would seem, therefore, the new law will inevitably lessen 
the school revenue in some localities, whatever may be the result in 
the aggregate. 
‘Permanent funds—The permanent school funds have been the 
subject of legislation in several States. The creation of such a fund in 
Pennsylvania has been described; in Minnesota an amendment to the 
constitution has been proposed to authorize the loaning of school 
funds on improved farm lands. In New York the county loan com- 
missioners are abolished and complete control of the education fund 
is vested in the State comptroller. In Kansas, Missouri, Oregon, and 
Vermont, also, laws were passed relating to such funds, but they were 
of less general importance. = 
Apportionment of State funds——The distribution of State school 
moneys will probably always be a bone of contention in some portion 
of the educational field. The very principle of State taxation, 
requiring the stronger half of a State to aid the weaker half, is 
attacked frequently and vigorously; and, until human nature reaches 
a very much higher state of perfection, injustice will be claimed in 
any plan of distribution that brings to any community less than it 
might receive under some other plan. It is generally easy to sup- 
port one’s interest in any legitimate cause with substantial argu-

ments, and it may be expected that from time to time some legislature 
-will be led to see the error of the previous: way, whatever that way 
may have been. 
The plan of collecting a State school tits on the basis of wealth 
and distributing it on the basis of school population was at one time 
considered generally to be equitable and proper, and school popula- 
tion is still the basis of distribution, wholly or in part, in 32 of the 
States. Dissatisfaction with this basis has become more pronounced, 
however, within the past few years, finding expression in school 
reports, in the educational press, and in at least one ably written 
monograph. The effect has already appeared in legislation, in Mis- 
souri and California most conspicuously. In both States the element 
of school population has been wholly eliminated in the apportion- 
ment. The former Missouri law considered no other factor, and the 
change in that State is complete, the new basis relating, first, to the 
number of teachers employed, and, second, to the total number of 
days’ attendance of all pupils in the several counties. In California 
the old plan was to distribute, first, $250 to each district containing 
70 census children or fraction of that number and $250 for each 
additional 70 census children or fraction thereof; and, second, the 
moneys remaining were divided on the basis of average daily attend- 
ance. According to the plan of 1911, however, “35 children in 
average daily attendance” is substituted as the unit of the first cal- 
culation instead of “70 census children.” The school-census law was 
repealed in toto. 
In Nevada an extensive change was made, but the reasons for it 
differed from those that actuated the legislators of the two States 
just mentioned. In Nevada the State money was formerly appor- 
tioned to the counties in proportion to the school population, and 
was divided between the districts in the counties in a different 
manner. It happened, in consequence, that serious inequalities 
resulted in the amounts received by districts of equal population in 
different counties, and it was principally on that account that the 
change was made. By the present plan the apportionment is made 
by the State superintendent directly to the districts. Seventy per 
cent of the distributive fund is allotted to the districts, nominally on 
the basis of teachers, but in reality on the basis of school population, 
for in the calculation one teacher is allowed for each 30 census chil- 
dren or fraction thereof. The remaining 30 per cent is distributed 
- directly in proportion to school population. 
In Idaho a new plan is in use for the distribution within the coun- 
ties, but the school population is retained as the only factor in 
making the allotment from the State to the counties. The new 
“JTdaho plan” has attracted. wide attention and is as follows: Two- 
thirds of the whole amount is apportioned by the county superin- 
terident among the several districts in proportion to their respective
-P-A-G-E-104
  84 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
school population, considering each district to contain at least 20 
children; 5 per cent of the remaining one-third, or as much thereof as 
may be needed, is apportioned among the rural high-school districts 
in proportion to the number of regular high-school teachers, but not 
over $300 shall be apportioned for any teacher; 50 per cent of the 
remainder, if so much is required, is used to aid certain weak dis- 
tricts; the balance remaining is apportioned to the several districts 
in proportion to the number of census children. 
One of the relics of a bygone age eliminated by the Pennsylvania 
Code commission was the use of the “number of taxables” as a 
basis of distributing the State appropriation. This factor was pecul- 
iar to Pennsylvania, and at one time was the sole basis, but latterly 
the number of paid teachers and the school population were made of 
equal weight with it. Now only the two last named remain, and half 
the fund is distributed to the districts upon the basis of each. 
The time and frequency of the State apportionments are often 
matters of concern to local officers. Unnecessary delay is largely 
prevented in many of the States by legally prescribing the exact 
dates upon which the proceeds from certain taxes shall be distributed, 
but such provisions do not meet all conditions. The investigating 
committee of the New Jersey Senate, to which reference has been 
made heretofore, found that in many instances serious difficulties 
had resulted to local authorities from undue delay in distribution, 
together with the operation of the statutes which prevent the use of 
money in one fund for purposes for which another fund is provided , 
by law. Districts in some cases had considerable balances to their 
favor in certain funds deposited in banks, but in need of moneys due 
from the State they were compelled to borrow money that was 
actually their own and to pay the banks for the use of it. To avoid 
such inconvenience and expense, a bill was proposed and passed pro- 
viding that receipts from taxes levied in any year shall be distributed 
on the following September 1, later collections being distributed 
October 25 and thereafter as frequently as the collections shall 
amount to $5,000. i 
With a similar purpose in view a law was enacted in Washington 
providing for six apportionments a year, all moneys available being 
distributed each time. 
Aid to weak districts —Further extension is noted in the practice 
which has found favor inmany States of granting special aid to dis- 
tricts so weak that they can not maintain schools for the required time 
with the proceeds of the maximum tax authorized by law. Idaho, 
Kansas, and New Mexico were added during the year under review 
to the list of States in which such provision is made. The provision 
occurred in Idaho as a part of the general plan of distribution, as 
described in a preceding paragraph, but in Kansas it was an important 
portion of a new law relating to the minimum term of district schools.
-P-A-G-E-105
  EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION IN 1911. 85 
By this act if a district can not provide seven months’ school with 
all the funds available the State is obligated to contribute three- 
fourths the deficiency and the county is required to pay the remaining 
one-fourth. New Mexico goes further and makes such provision a 
constitutional matter; before the State funds are distributed each 
year a sufficient sum must be reserved to enable all weak districts to 
maintain school for the full period prescribed by the constitution— 
namely, five months. In Oklahoma steps were taken in the same 
direction by proposing a constitutional amendment to authorize the 
State to apportion to any such weak district the amount necessary 
to enable it to maintain school for five months. 
In several of the States in which specific appropriations are cus- 
tomarily made for this purpose the amounts were increased during 
the year. In New Hampshire the increase was from $80,000 to 
$115,000; in Maine from $20,000 to $27,000; in South Carolina from 
$20,000 to $60,000, etc. On the contrary, the corresponding appro- 
priation in Ohio was reduced from $50,000 to $19,000, and a bill 
which passed the Colorado Legislature providing for an emergency 
fund of $20,000 to be used by the State superintendent for a similar 
purpose was vetoed by the governor. 
There is an intimate relation between such appropriations and the 
levy of a State school tax, and this relation is not overlooked in 
legislative debates. Any general discussion of the one necessarily 
involves the other both in principle and practice. 
School bonds.—School district bonds fill a large place in nearly all 
codes; they consume much of the time of legislatures, and they are 
the cause of more litigation than any other single phase of the schools’ 
interests. In some of the States every bond issue of any amount 
must be separately authorized by the legislature, but in the majority 
general laws authorize districts to issue bonds for specified purposes, 
in prescribed ways, and in limited amounts. These provisions are 
in many cases written in great detail, and their complexity frequently 
leads to misunderstanding and failure to observe essential require- 
ments, which omissions must be remedied by special enactments or 
by judicial decisions. In some of the States whose constitutions 
forbid special laws, great ingenuity is often shown in describing a 
particular district in general terms, so that an act to validate an 
informal bond issue already effected will not open a way for future 
abuses. Such laws were, as usual, conspicuous in the proceedings of 
several of the legislatures during the past year. 
Some general laws of interest were also passed, that of Tennessee 
being especially noteworthy, for there was previously no- authority 
in law for the issue of bonds for the construction of schoolhouses, 
and. the new law supplies this need. A similar condition continues 
to exist in Florida and the effort to remedy it failed to accomplish 
the desired result during the recent session.
-P-A-G-E-106
  
86 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911, 
The abuses discovered by the senatorial investigating committee 
in New Jersey were in great measure connected with the issue and sale 
of bonds, and two laws were passed to correct the evils that were discov- 
ered. One of them restricts the sale of school bonds at private sale, 
and forbids the delivery of such bonds outside the State, and in 
any case except upon payment in cash or its equivalent. The 
other law requires that every coupon bond held by the trustees of 
the school fund shall be stamped. 
In Minnesota the maximum bonded indebtedness of any district 
was raised from 5 to 10 per cent of its assessed valuation. Similarly, 
in Iowa the legal limit of indebtedness of independent districts was 
raised from 24 per cent to 4 per cent of the actual value of taxable 
property. Presumably the difference in these percentages is due 
in a large measure to varying bases of assessment. 
Local taxes.—In regard to local taxation for schools, comparatively 
few general laws have been passed recently. Next to that of Ohio, 
which was described in a preceding paragraph, the most important 
are reported from North Carolina. The compulsory county tax in 
that State was increased from 1.8 mills to 2 mills, and the result, 
with the normal increase in valuation, will be a gain to the schools of 
about $450,000. In addition, any county was authorized to levy 
a special ad valorem tax not to exceed 3 mills, and not over 90 cents 
on each poll. 
The compulsory county tax levy was raised in Oregon also, the 
increase in this instance being from $7 to $8 per capita of school 
population. 
In Nevada the minimum school tax required to be levied by the 
counties is increased from 1.5 to 2 mills, and district trustees are 
authorized to levy 2.5 mills in addition, the previous requirement for 
popular vote under certain conditions being omitted. These pro- 
visions are of especial significance, in connection with the increased 
State levy, in view of the fact that Nevada already expends more per 
pupil than any other State in the Union. 
Important laws of limited application were enacted in other States, 
particularly West Virginia, Kansas, New Jersey, Minnesota, Nebraska, 
and Wisconsin. 
DISTRICT, TOWNSHIP, AND MUNICIPAL OFFICERS. 
The usual grist of local laws has been delivered by the several legis- 
latures, but few of the many bills possess general significance. The 
tendency to smaller school boards in cities is still evident. In Kan- 
sas all cities of the first and second classes, except Wichita, will here- 
after have school boards of six members only, elected by the voters 
at large, for four-year terms, three terms expiring every odd year. 
Heretofore two or three members were elected from each city ward.
-P-A-G-E-107
EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION IN 1911. 87 
In New Jersey the boards of education in all cities are reduced from 
nine to seven members each. The school board of Terre Haute, Ind., 
has been reduced to five trustees, each to receive $500 per annum. 
The court of common pleas occupies a prominent place in the 
Pennsylvania school code, and important duties are assigned to its 
judges in several situations which demand conservatism, unbiased 
judgment, and intimate knowledge of local conditions. Under the 
old law the members of the board of education of Philadelphia were 
appointed by the judges of this court, and now the same method of 
choice is extended to ‘‘cities of the first class,’ which includes Pitts- 
burgh as well as Philadelphia. The number of members of the 
boards in these cities is reduced to 15, but in order to furnish the ele- 
ment of local participation to a greater degree than would be possible 
with a small appointed body, boards of school visitors are provided 
for each ward, to be elected by popular vote. In all districts of Penn- 
sylvania excepting the two cities named, the directors are elected at 
large by popular vote; the full terms are six years, about one-third 
of them expiring every two years. The number of directors varies 
from five to nine according to the population of the district. 
The duties of superintendents and the terms of their employment 
have received attention in several of the States. In Montana and 
North Dakota cities may contract with their superintendents for 
periods as long as three years, which is an extension of the time 
previously specified. 
In four of the six New England States there has been during the 
year important legislation relating to superintendents. The con- 
ditions of supervision in that section are unique. The county does 
not exist for school purposes, and of course county supervision is not 
included in the plan of public education. The cities and many of 
the stronger towns (or townships) have long employed superintend- 
ents, but in the weaker towns there was in the past no professional 
oversight of the schools. Recent legislatures by successive enact- 
ments have sought to induce such towns to unite for the purpose of 
employing superintendents, and reasonable progress has been made. 
In Massachusetts the law already in force required the formation of 
such unions under the direction of the board of education, and in 
that State effort is now directed to perfecting rather than extending 
the system. Three bills to this end were drawn by the State board 
during the year, and all became laws. 
The first related to the term of office of superintendents, that being 
fixed uniformly at three years, but authority to remove was given to 
the joint committee subject to the approval of the State board of 
education. The second was designed to promote the permanency of 
unions by repealing the former three-year limitation and by making 
the consent of the board of education necessary to dissolution. The
-P-A-G-E-108
  
88 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
third bill contained the first legal definition of the status and duties 
of a school superintendent that has ever appeared upon the statute 
books of Massachusetts, although the idea of supervision as it now 
prevails had its first application in New England. It is plain from 
the diversity of practice described by the State commissioner of edu- 
cation that the need of such a law was great. 
In Connecticut, Maine, and Vermont additional laws were enacted 
to facilitate the formation of unions and the employment of superin- 
tendents. 
ADMINISTRATIVE UNITS. 
The “school wagon” has had profound influence upon rural school 
organization and conditions whose extent it is already difficult to 
estimate, and it is evident that that influence has scarcely more than 
had its beginning. 
The consolidation of schools leads ultimately, if not immediately, 
to consolidation of districts. The previous organization is not 
necessarily abandoned when a small school is discontinued, and it 
often, if not usually, happens that the small districts are continued 
fora time. But with their purpose gone, there is no reason for their 
existence, and complete consolidation is the logical outcome. 
The tendency in legislation is toward immediate dissolution of the 
component districts when consolidation is effected, but it is not 
always so; and in many States the trustees of a small school may of 
their own motion close that school and transport the children to a 
school in an adjoining district after making an arrangement to that 
end with the trustees of the other district. Laws were recently 
passed in Illinois, Minnesota, and Wisconsin authorizing such action, 
and in none of these cases would there be, of necessity, any change in 
organization. The Wisconsin law provides additional State aid to 
each district which thus closes its school, and requires a high standard. 
in the school to which the children are sent. 
On the contrary, complete reorganization is contemplated by laws 
passed during the year in Oklahoma, Georgia, Kansas, Minnesota, 
and by another act in Wisconsin. All these require that free trans- 
portation shall be furnished to all children living more than a specified 
distance from the schoolhouse. 
The laws mentioned for the two last-named States are of more than 
usual importance. The consolidated districts of the new type in 
Minnesota must comprise not less than 18 sections, and may include 
territory in more than one county. Instruction in agriculture, man- 
ual training, and domestic scienceis contemplated, and a high standard 
of buildings, teachers, and equipment is required. The school boards 
of such districts must provide transportation for all pupils living

in the same capacity at the latter date. *

EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION IN 1911. 89 
more than 2 miles from the school, or in lieu of such transportation 
they may make reasonable provision for room and board for pupils 
whose attendance can be more economically and conveniently secured 
by such means. State aid varying from $750 to $1,500 is offered to 
such schools, and, in addition, aid not exceeding $1,500 is offered for 
the construction of the building. 
The second of the new Wisconsin laws mentioned binds the State 
to pay not over 10 cents a day for each child transported in a consoli- 
dated district, provided the child shall attend school regularly for at 
least six months. 
Consolidation has appeared also in other phases in the enactments 
of the year. In Iowa and Texas the formation of ‘‘county-line” 
districts was authorized by the union of districts in different counties, 
and in California and Kansas additional laws were passed to facilitate 
the annexation of suburban districts to city organizations. 
The township system of organization may be expected to have a 
place every year in the legislation of some State, and this time it 
appears in Indiana and Wisconsin. In the former State any incor- 
porated town not exceeding 1,500 inhabitants is authorized to discon- 
tinue its school board and transfer its school property to the proper 
township trustee, entering the township system. In Wisconsin, 
where the township system has been in limited use, that plan of 
organization was definitely abolished by the act of June 22,1911. It 
is stated that so many abuses and defects were connected with the 
practical administration of the system in Wisconsin that the only 
remedy was to completely reorganize the plan of control of schools 
thus governed. Nevertheless, by another law in the same State, the 
county supervisors may organize school districts containing more 
than 36 square miles, the area covered by a congressional township. 
SCHOOLHOUSES. 
In the legislation of the year concerning schoolhouses two enact- 
ments stand conspicuously above all the rest, namely, the building 
code of Ohio and the sanitary schoolhouse law of Indiana. The 
former is the more comprehensive, and, as its name indicates, it covers 
all classes of construction. ‘‘School buildings,” however, comprise 
an important part of it, and under that head are included all struc- 
tures which contain one or more rooms used for the assembling of 
persons for the purpose of acquiring knowledge or for mental training. 
Not only schools, colleges, and seminaries, but libraries, museums, 
and art galleries are within this definition. 
The provisions of the statute are minute, and regulate the details 
of construction, materials, precautions against fire and panic, size   
1 The question of transportation not involving changes in district organization is further discussed on a 
subsequent page (p. 106). 
   
-P-A-G-E-110
  90 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
of rooms, air space, ventilation, lighting, heating, sanitation, and 
nearly everything else that has been included in the most advanced 
laws of the kind within recent years. The provisions seem to be in 
full accord with the most approved practices, and few omissions are 
apparent; one of the most important omissions is that no require- 
ment is made as to the proportion of moisture in the air supplied to 
schoolrooms. Other details of the same sort are covered with great 
care, and it is likely that the failure to include this item was due to 
a mere oversight. As this is a ‘‘building code,” it naturally relates 
to construction primarily, and does not include many of the usual 
requirements concerning sanitation in operation of the school plant. 
The Indiana law, on the contrary, is concerned largely with the 
sanitation of operation. It contains little that touches structural 
features proper and nothing at all that relates to fire protection; 
but with respect to the subject matter that it does cover it is exceed- 
ingly minute in requirement and rigid in provision for enforcement. 
One of its clauses may even provoke a smile because of its novelty 
and ingenuity, namely, ‘‘Any money claim for the material entering 
into or any money claim for the construction of any schoolhouse 
which does not in every way and in all respects comply with the 
requirements of this act shall be null and void.” The eagerness 
with which architects and builders will study the statute, in view of 
this provision, may be imagined. 
In addition to matters of location, lighting, seating, heating, ven- 
tilation, sanitary arrangements and the like, there is much in the 
law that concerns not the school building but the pupils and their 
condition of health, and the statute is in reality almost as much a 
medical inspection measure as a schoolhouse law. 
These two measures deserve prominence because of their compre- 
hensiveness, minuteness, and adherence to accepted standards, but 
they are by no means alone in the field. An excellent law was enacted 
in North Dakota, bearing many of the characteristics of both the 
Ohio and the Indiana laws, for it includes provisions that relate to 
structure, fire protection, sanitation, and inspection, all in the same 
statute. Stringent and specific laws requiring fire escapes have been 
put on the statute books of Michigan, New Jersey, Wisconsin, Kansas, 
and Iowa, and it is clear that the terrible lessons of the Collinwood 
School and the Iroquois Theater still have their effect, for in this 
respect schoolhouses are usually coupled with other classes of buildings 
in which numbers of people are accustomed to congregate. 
The use of schoolhouses as social centers is widely extending, not 
only in the cities, but in the rural districts as well. Perhaps the 
movement to this end is even more pronounced in the country, for 
it is an essential factor in the ‘“‘rural uplift.” General permissive 
legislation recognizing this movement, appeared in two of the States
-P-A-G-E-111
  EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION IN 1911. 91 
in 1911,namely, Massachusetts and Wisconsin, and in Missouri the 
boards of education of Kansas City and St. Joseph were authorized. 
to erect and maintain auditoriums suitable for public gatherings. 
The extent of this movement must not be judged, of course, by 
these three laws alone, for it must be understood that many others of 
the same sort have preceded them. 
TEACHERS. 
EXAMINATION AND CERTIFICATION. 
No other single subject relating to education has occupied as much 
of the attention of State school officers and of legislators during 1911 
as the problem of teachers’ certificates. Scarcely a State in which 
the general assembly has met has failed to produce some contribu- 
tion to the aggregate of legislation concerning this most important 
subject. Conferences of State superintendents of the West and 
Middle West were held at Lincoln, Nebr., Salt Lake City, Utah, and 
Topeka, Kans., to consider the matter, and discussions in the press 
and in educational meetings generally have served to keep the sub- 
ject in the forefront. The primary object in view is the elevation 
of standards; and as tending to this end, as well as to conduce to the 
convenience of school officers and teachers alike, it is sought to 
establish uniformity of practice, with proper recognition of certifi- 
cates of other States and due credit for diplomas of normal schools, 
colleges, and universities, 
The legislatures have as a rule responded cordially to the recom- 
mendations of school officers, and gratifying progress has been made 
toward the elevation of standards and interstate cooperation and 
reciprocity. The outlook is promising for still further improvement 
in both respects. 
The most gratifying fact in this connection is that the diffusion of 
popular education has reached such a point as to make these measures 
possible. The number of cases in which relaxation of standards is 
necessary are very few, and are confined to sparsely settled rural 
districts. These exist in nearly all the States, and probably will 
continue to exist in gradually decreasing numbers for another genera- 
tion at least. 
It is difficult for one surrounded by the comforts and conveniences 
of a prosperous community to realize the hardships of school work 
on the western deserts and in some of the mountain districts of any 
section. Even yet in exceptional cases dwellings are miles apart; 
communication with the outside world is at a minimum; the average 
of intelligence and culture is low; comfortable quarters and even 
wholesome food are not easily found; and existence itself involves  
-P-A-G-E-112
    
92 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
a struggle. Add to these discouraging circumstances the difficulty 
of raising enough money by ordinary means in such districts to pay 
the salaries proposed, and it may be easily understood that it is 
difficult to induce teachers with even the minimum of the prescribed 
qualifications to accept such positions. 
In order, therefore, to provide some measure of instruction for 
children so disadvantageously situated, the statutes of most of the 
States vest in some officer the authority to relax the strictness of the 
general law at proper times. Such a provision was recently inserted 
in the Nebraska Code after an exhaustive investigation of the schools 
in the least-favored portions of the western part of the State. Similar 
action was taken also in Nevada, Washington, and West Virginia. 
Under normal conditions, however, it is now possible to maintain 
a teaching standard that is reasonably satisfactory and to enforce 
laws that would have been impossible even 10 years ago, so rapidly 
has the improvement progressed. 
Experience has shown that on the whole the best results are 
reached with centralization in the matter of certificating teachers. 
Formerly the county superintendents or other local officers were 
usually charged with that duty, but the results were not satisfactory. 
The certificates were not all of equal value, and the credentials of 
one county could not be utilized in another. An attempt was made 
to remedy the evil by causing the questions for all examinations to 
be prepared by a central agency, generally in the office of the State 
superintendent. This was an improvement, but it was still not 
sufficient, for the grading of the papers was done according to varying 
ideals of perfection. The plan now generally accepted as the most 
efficient is to place the entire matter in the control of State officers, 
either the board of education, the superintendent of public instruc- 
tion, or a board of examiners under the supervision of the State 
superintendent. By this plan the questions are prepared by the 
central authority and are forwarded to the proper county superin- 
tendent. The papers are written in the presence of that officer and 
are then forwarded to the central authority and duly rated. Suc- 
cessful applicants receive appropriate certificates signed by State 
officers, and may teach in the grades or schools specified in any county 
in which their certificates are properly registered. 
Substantially this plan is followed in many of the States, and during 
the year it was adopted in Oregon, Missouri, Georgia, Texas, New 
Hampshire, Nevada, and North Dakota, and in Massachusetts so far 
as State-aided high schools are concerned. 
As a rule the proper officers of the larger cities are allowed to make 
their own rules for examination and certification, but in Nebraska 
the cities as well as the counties were brought under the rules of the 
State superintendent by the act of April 8, 1911. That officer has 
 
-P-A-G-E-113
  
EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION IN 1911. 93 
provided for a special series of certificates for the cities, and is now in 
practical control of the entire business of certification in the State. 
“ Building” certificates.—Professional improvement of the teacher 
and his progress from one grade of certificate to a higher grade is 
always encouraged, and several recent laws have been enacted to 
facilitate such progress. It is recognized that periodical tests in the 
common branches do not constitute the best means of insuring pro- 
fessional development, and that a teacher who has passed a satis- 
factory examination in a given branch and has been in active educa- 
tional work since may be expected to have continued proficient in 
that branch. It is considered preferable, therefore, to encourage 
teachers to take up new studies and to “build” to higher certificates 
by passing in additional branches rather than to repeat previous 
work. This idea is prominent in new certificate laws in Iowa, Texas, 
and to a less extent in Kansas, and there is little doubt that it will 
be a feature in the systems of other States in the future. 
Minimum qualifications —Practical considerations must always 
control any scheme for improvement, and in prescribing minimum 
qualifications it is always necessary to draw the line at a point high 
enough to insure a degree of preparation that will guarantee effective 
instruction of the grade required, but not so high as to make it 
impossible to man all the schools. Consequently in very few of the 
States has the attempt been made to prescribe the exact point in a 
standard course of study which an individual must reach in order to 
be eligible to teach. But it is now thought by many that the time 
has come for such provisions, and in Kansas it has been enacted that 
after May 1, 1917, no teacher’s certificate shall be granted to any 
person who has not completed the full four years’ high-school course 
or its equivalent. In the meantime the standard will be raised 
gradually to that point. 
In Missouri a similar requirement was made with reference to first 
and second grade county certificates, the date fixed being September 
1, 1918, but the requirement does not apply to certificates of the third 
grade. The effect of the law, therefore, will be peculiar: A third- 
grade certificate may be issued to an individual four successive years 
but no more; at the end of that time he must retire from the service 
if, he has not had a full high-school course, for there is no kind of 
certificate for which he will be eligible; but another applicant with - 
no more preparation and wholly without experience may obtain the 
certificate and teach the school which can not be given to the experi- 
enced teacher. This situation will not arise for several years, how- 
ever, and in the meantime there will be ample opportunity for any 
change that may be considered advisable. 
Additional subjects—The laws described in the foregoing para- 
graphs are expressions of the general tendency to higher standards, 
and that tendency is variously shown in other States. In Alabama 
 
-P-A-G-E-114
  94 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
all applicants for certificates must be examined upon the theory and 
practice of teaching, United States history, and civies; in Michigan 
the school law of the State and the State course of study for district 
schools are added subjects; in Ohio elementary agriculture is made 
a required subject for elementary-school certificates; in Texas the 
third-grade county certificate is discontinued. 
Recognition of diplomas.—In the matter of recognition of diplomas 
of institutions and of certificates of other States the following enact- 
ments deserve attention: In Iowa certificates validated by the State 
board of examiners are valid for five years. In Kansas the State 
board of education must prepare an accredited list of standard col- 
leges and universities, either within or without the State, maintaining 
a department of education; and each graduate of an approved course 
of an institution upon that list will, upon application, receive a State 
certificate valid three years, which may be extended for life after 
two years’ successful experience. In Montana certificates are granted. 
to graduates of the State university upon specified conditions. In 
Oregon. graduates of standard institutions who have studied educa- 
tion for 15 semester hours may receive certificates without examina- 
tion; the standardization (or classification) of institutions must be 
that of the United States Bureau of Education, or in the absence of 
such action, that of a specially constituted State board. Credits 
obtained upon examination by State authorities of another State 
may be accepted for equivalent certificates in Oregon. In Penn- 
sylvania the State superintendent may validate life certificates of 
other States. In Texas the holder of a life certificate of another State 
may receive a State permanent certificate, and appropriate provision 
is made for graduates of standard normal schools and of other higher 
institutions. In Vermont the State superintendent may grant five~ 
year certificates to graduates of approved normal schools of other 
States. In Washington the results of State examinations elsewhere 
may be accepted subject for subject. by the State board of education. 
SALARIES. 
The final success of the prolonged struggle of the women teachers 
of New York City for ‘equal pay for equal work” is the most inter- 
esting and significant event of the year in legislation relating to 
salaries. For nearly 50 years compensation determined not by sex 
but by the service rendered has been the object of almost constant 
agitation, and in the past 10 years efforts have been particularly 
active. Five successive legislatures dealt with the problem without 
result, but October, 1911, witnessed the passage of the bill that 
finally settled the controversyand in favor of the women. The right 
of the board of education to fix the salaries of teachers is not abridged, 
‘except by the express stipulation that no discrimination shall be 
made on account of sex.
-P-A-G-E-115
EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION IN 1911. 95 
It is to be expected that men will continue to predominate in the 
higher positions and women in the lower, and that the average salary 
of men will be considerably above that of women. But schedules like 
that in which male principals receive $1,000 a year more than female 
principals of equal rank will no longer be seen in New York City. 
Similar in some respects was the campaign waged by the teachers 
of elementary schools in Boston, for the agitation was conducted 
principally by and for women, although there was no direct contro- 
versy over the question of sex discrimination. Early in the session 
of the general court the passage of a bill was secured which required 
that 10 cents of the school-tax levy of $3.70 in Boston be devoted to 
increasing the salaries of teachers in elementary schools. The bill 
failed to meet the approval of the governor, and his veto was sus- 
tained by a close vote. The opposition was based largely upon the 
argument that the measure involved unwarranted interference with 
the principle of home rule, and that it unduly favored one class of 
teachers. Undaunted, the teachers interested set themselves to the 
task of framing a bill free from objection that would accomplish their 
purpose. Like their sisters of the metropolis, théy succeeded, and a 
substantial increase in their salaries will result. 
Less spectacular but perhaps more important in the aggregate was 
the legislation in Pennsylvania on the salary question. There the 
minimum salary that may be paid to any public school teacher was 
taised from $40 to $45, and the minimum that may be paid to any 
such teacher who has taught successfully for two years was fixed at 
$55, instead of $50 as formerly. The State is obligated to pay the 
differencé between the salaries paid in 1906 and the prescribed mini- 
mum, and this provision involves an additional appropriation. 
In Indiana, also, an important increase is noted; the minimum 
daily wage of teachers exempt from examination is raised one-sixth. 
The manner in which this is done is a part of a unique plan of deter- 
mining salaries, which, like many other Indiana laws, is distinctly 
ingenious. The salary of such a teacher must be at least 34 cents 
(instead of 3 cents) a day, multiplied by the general average of scholar- 
ship and success given to that teacher. The ‘‘grade of scholarship” 
is that attained in the teacher’s last examination and the “grade of 
success” is that given for the teacher’s term last preceding the date 
of his contract. No explanation is required to disclose the purpose 
of this arrangement. 
No State aid may hereafter be granted to any school in Wisconsin 
for instruction given in agriculture, domestic economy, manual train- 
ing, or industrial branches unless the salary paid to every teacher of 
such subjects be at least $60 per month. These subjects are prom- 
inent in the Wisconsin school system, and their importance is increas- 
ing with the growth of the county agricultural high schools and like
-P-A-G-E-116
  96 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
institutions. The new provision, therefore, is of especial significance 
in that State. 
PENSIONS. 
With each succeeding year it becomes more apparent that the 
superannuation of teachers past the period of usefulness is destined 
to become an essential feature of the American school system. The 
period of inquiry and experiment is rapidly passing, and the laws of 
1911 disclose a degree of uniformity which indicates that the lessons 
of the past have been heeded, and the disposition is manifest to place 
the matter upon a basis of permanence and effectiveness. 
It has become apparent that salary deductions within any reason- 
able limit are not sufficient to maintain a retirement fund, and that 
contributions and receipts from fairs and picnics-are too uncertain 
to form the basis of an enduring system. The logical solution is that 
the same authority that pays the salaries must pay the pensions, and 
the tendencies of the time are all in that direction. It is inevitable 
that a period must be passed in which a part of the cost will be met 
by a general reduction of salaries in the form of assessments; per- 
haps popular sentiment demands it. In the end, however, it must 
be seen that the so-called assessments are an empty formality; the 
schedules may be readjusted, perhaps, to meet the new conditions, 
put there is no doubt that annuities will be finally paid generally from 
public funds. This condition has already been fully reached in 
Rhode Island and Maryland, and in New York in State institutions, 
while the same statement is true of New Jersey in relation to one of 
its two parallel pension systems. Both Virginia and New York, in 
its general law, now closely approximate the same condition, but in 
those States the formality of deduction is still maintained. 
The most important legislation of the year in this connection was 
in New York, Wisconsin, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Vermont, but 
other enactments, named below, are of significance in less degree only 
because they are less general in their scope. 
New York formerly had a general pension law, but it was not prac- 
ticable and was omitted in the revision of the school code of 1910. 
The law of June 26, 1911, however, seems to be thoroughly workable 
and provides a State system that should be effective. Counties, 
districts, and cities in which local retirement funds are in operation 
are exempted from the provisions of the law, but such localities may 
be brought within the State system if two-thirds the teachers con- 
cerned so desire. A State teachers’ retirement fund board is con- 
stituted to administer the fund, and the necessary moneys are to be 
derived principally from salary deductions of 1 per cent, which are 
retained from the State apportionment, and from appropriations to 
be made by the State legislature. Annuities are limited to $600 per 
annum.
-P-A-G-E-117
EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION IN 1911. 97 
The “‘teachers’ insurance and retirement fund law’ of Wisconsin 
is a combination of features that exist in other laws, but as a whole 
it differs from all the rest, though it closely approaches the New 
York measure. It provides a State system, with a board of control 
consisting of the State treasurer, the superintendent of public instruc- 
tion, and three elected members, one of whom must be a woman. 
Ten cents per capita of the school population of the State must be 
reserved from the State school tax for the pension fund and teachers 
must contribute to it 1 per cent of their salaries during the first 10 
years of service and 2 per cent thereafter. Teachers already in 
service may accept the provisions of the law or not, at their option, 
but those who enter the profession after September 1, 1911, accept 
its provisions in accepting appointment. Annuities will amount 
to $12.50 for each year of service, the maximum being $450. Since 
there is already a retirement fund in Milwaukee, that city is excepted 
from the law. 
Ohio.—The Ohio pension system is still essentially local, and the 
several boards of education may establish retirement funds at their 
option. This State, therefore, is not to be classed with either of those 
mentioned in the foregoing paragraphs in the breadth of its legal 
provisions, but with the new law in effect (house bill No. 142, ap- 
proved June 13, 1911) the local funds appear to be upon a permanent 
and satisfactory basis. It was required previously that not less than 
1 nor more than 2 per cent of the gross receipts from taxation of the 
proper board of education should be applied to pensions, but the 
participation of teachers was optional with themselves. The present 
law, however, provides that all new teachers shall accept the provi- 
sions of the pension law and that their contracts shall include such 
acceptance. Teachers already in the service may still exercise 
their option in the matter. 
It is hoped that the obligatory clause as it is now drawn will 
stand the test of the courts, since it becomes a matter of contract; 
but it must be said that the courts of Ohio have in the past pursued 
a line of reasoning opposed to compulsion, and there is still a possi- 
bility that this provision, common to nearly all the effective laws 
upon the subject, will be declared void. In only one other State, 
New Jersoy, has the question been at issue before the courts and in 
that case (Allen v. Board of Education of Passaic, Feb. 27, 1911) the 
decision emphatically upheld the law. 
Pennsylwania.—The Pennsylvania Code of 1911 contains the first 
general provision in that State for pensions. Previously there were 
permissive laws for Philadelphia, for cities of the second and third 
classes, and possibly for certain other localities by special act, but 
there was no law of general effect. The new code authorizes the 
13144°—rp 1911—vot i——_7
-P-A-G-E-118
    
98 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
board of directors of any district to establish a retirement fund, to 
appropriate public moneys therefor, and to provide in the contracts 
with its teachers that they shall contribute a reasonable sum from 
their salaries each year to said retirement fund. As may be seen, 
this law is much less definite than that of Ohio, but it is in the same 
direction and, considering what had gone before, it is as much a step 
in advance as the other. 
Vermont.—The Vermont Legislature in January, 1911, authorized 
any town or incorporated district to vote a pension from school funds 
for any teacher who has taught for more than 30 years. No reduction 
in the salaries of those still in service is required, and no elaborate 
machinery is provided. If the voters at town meeting see fit to do so, 
they will vote to pension certain teachers as they vote other expendi- 
tures; that is all. Such is the simplicity of local government in New 
England. 
Illinois.—There has been a retirement fund in Chicago for several 
years, and in the beginning participation was compulsory upon all 
teachers. That plan, however, did not appeal to many, and when 
petitioned to do so the legislature withdrew the compulsory clause. 
There was no contribution from public funds at first, but later it was 
provided that the interest on deposits of school moneys should be 
devoted to the retirement fund. And now, by the act of June 5, 1911, 
the board of education of the city is required to contribute an 
amount equal to the aggregate of deductions from teachers’ salaries 
for the fund. Naturally, this additional help from public funds 
will make participation more desirable, and the teachers who have 
not previously elected to come within the provisions are allowed 
by a new act another opportunity to do so. The law is still essen- 
tially optional in its terms, however. 
With the exception of Chicago there has been no provision for 
retirement in Illinois until the past legislative session. An act was 
passed (June 6, 1911) which authorizes the board of education of 
any district having between 1,000 and 100,000 inhabitants to establish 
and maintain a retirement fund upon an assessment basis. Further, 
in its last section, it permits any school district in which there is not 
suflicient revenue to maintain a pension fund under the preceding 
sections to pension from public funds any teacher over 50 years old 
who has faithfully served the district for 25 years. This action must 
be by majority vote of the district. 
The terms of this section do not require that the assessment system 
shall be first attempted; it seems only to be necessary that it be 
shown that the funds that can be thus raised will not be sufficient. 
In many cases this will be immediately apparent; for a district of 
1,000 inhabitants would scarcely have a dozen teachers and the 
assessments on their salaries would not pay a single pension. If
-P-A-G-E-119
  
EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION IN 1911, 99 
there is doubt in any other case, an investigation of the history of 
assessment experiments elsewhere will show that the provisions of 
the first portion of the law are wholly inadequate. The Illinois pen- 
sion law of June 6, 1911, therefore, actually and generally authorizes 
teachers’ pensions from public funds, although that fact may not 
yet be realized. Perhaps it was not so understood by its promoters 
at the time of its passage, for the assessment provisions aro similar to 
those of many other retirement bills that have been enacted with the 
utmost gravity and in good faith. 
Kansas.—The creation of a retirement fund by the board of educa- 
tion of any city of the first class was authorized in Kansas by the act 
of March 14, 1911. This applies to the six cities of the State which 
contain over 15,000 inhabitants. The necessary moneys are to be 
derived from salary deductions of not less than 1 nor more than 1} 
per cent and from appropriations from school funds which shall be 
not less than 14 times the amount of salary assessments and not less 
than the amount necessary to meet the payments provided for in the 
law. This constitutes a general guarantee of the payment of the 
pensions granted and is far more effective than to specify a certain 
proportion of the school funds or a certain amount that must, or 
may, be contributed by the school authorities. Another commend- 
able feature is the clause which stipulates that a teacher going from 
one city to another in the State shall lose thereby none of his right of 
retirement. Any teacher is allowed the option of exemption from the 
provisions of the law, but its terms are so favorable that it is not to 
be expected that any one will desire such exemption if he contem- 
plates teaching as a life work. 
Other laws concerning pensions.—The State board of education of 
Massachusetts has been instructed by the legislature to investigate 
the advisability of paying a retirement allowance to any teacher who 
has taught 35 years. There is already a permissive statute in force 
applying to all towns and cities in the Commonwealth, and a different 
law requires the school committee of Boston to provide a pension 
fund. ‘The ‘‘resolve’’ mentioned above, therefore, seems to contem- 
plate the beginning of a State, rather than a local, system. 
“The New Jersey law requiring local authorities to retire applicants 
who have served 35 years has been amended so that 15 years of that 
service may have been in any State; 20 years, however, must have 
been under the board of education granting the pension. 
In Minnesota, retirement associations may be formed under city 
auspices in cities of over 10,000 inhabitants, the limit having been 
reduced from 50,000 by the legislature of 1911. 
Local pension systems were authorized in 1911 in Wilmington, 
Del., and Portland, Oreg. In the first named the city council must 
appropriate at least $2,000 annually, and in the second city the board  
-P-A-G-E-120
    100 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
of school directors must contribute a sum equal to 1 per cent of the 
amount received by the district as its portion of the county school 
tax. Assessments, of course, are contemplated in both cases. 
NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
The former inclination to multiply the number of State normal 
schools has waned perceptibly. Efforts were made in many of the 
States to strengthen and raise the standard of the schools already in 
existence, but only two new ones were established during 1911, 
namely, one in Maine and one in California. The two new schools 
for which appropriation was made in Ohio last year were located at 
Kent and Bowling Green, and the legislature of 1911 authorized the 
construction of buildings worth $250,000 for each of them. The 
Normal College of Mississippi, for which provision was made in 1910, 
was located at Hattiesburg after lively bidding by localities, and 
preparations have been made for construction. .These are the 
important events of the year that relate to new schools. 
On the other hand, legislation for normal schools already estab- 
lished has been fairly active. Of the three so-called State normal 
schools of Vermont, the one at Randolph Center has been discon- 
tinued and its buildings utilized for an agricultural school; the other 
two, at Johnson and Castleton, respectively, have been taken over 
by the State and will be conducted in future as State institutions in 
the full sense of the term, with a higher standard of scholarship. 
Somewhat similar action was taken in Alabama, where the control 
of all the State normal schools for white students was consolidated” 
in a single board of trustees, with a view to making them actually 
State institutions rather than local schools. The State appropriation 
for them was materially increased at the same time. 
The provisions of the Pennsylvania Code with the same purpose in 
view have already been mentioned. 
The situation in Oregon, which had been unsettled and unsatisfac- 
tory for several years, has apparently reached a definite solution. 
All four of the schools were entirely discontinued for a time, but one 
of them, at Monmouth, has been reestablished and put upon a perma- 
nent basis with an annual State tax in its favor of one twenty-fifth of a 
mill. It is interesting to note that this was proposed by an initi- 
ative petition, and was approved by the majority of votes cast on 
November 8, 1910. 
There is always a possibility that State normal sol may be 
made so effective as to defeat the very purpose of their creation, 
which is to train teachers for schools outside the cities. If the train- 
ing is of too high a grade the graduates can not be held in village and 
rural schools or even in school work at all in many cases. This con- 
sideration must necessarily limit the curriculum of the State normal
-P-A-G-E-121
  
EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION IN 1911. 101 
schools for a number of years—until the diffusion of education is 
complete; they must continue to occupy the middle ground in the 
field of pedagogical training. Above them, the teachers’ colleges 
and the departments of education in the universities must train the 
school officers and teachers of high schools. This work is constantly 
extending. The principal legislative event of the year in connection 
with it was the elevation of the State normal school at Greeley, Colo., 
to the dignity of a college. This institution was made the head of the 
normal training system of the State, and a large appropriation was 
made for the extension of its equipment and facilities. Another 
departure that is worthy of note is the act of the Ohio Legislature, 
which authorized the location of a high-school building on the campus 
of the Ohio State University, to be used as an observation and prac- 
tice school by the college of education of that university. 
Normal training in high schools —Below the normal schools, espe- 
cially in view of the general elevation of standards, means are neces- 
sary for preparing teachers for rural schools of the lesser type, for the 
conditions are not yet ripe, as a rule, for the normal school graduate in 
the one-room country school. This need has been met by establishing 
training courses in selected high schools, well distributed. New York 
has long had such courses; other States have established them more 
recently, and the plan has grown rapdily in favor in the past few years. 
Important laws providing for such high-school courses were 
passed during the year just past in Iowa, Vermont, and Arkansas. 
In the former State $25,000 was appropriated for the first year and 
$50,000 annually thereafter to aid the training classes, and since each 
school will receive not over $500 it will be seen that the benefits of 
the act will be sidely diffused. In Vermont provision is made for 
12 classes at first, but the number may be increased to 15 in the second 
year. The appropriation in the new high-school laws of Arkansas 
for encouraging normal training in selected high schools was $10,000, 
and since no one school may receive more than $1,000, it is evident 
that at least 10 schools will be aided. The provisions of the law 
are well drawn, and effective training seems to be assured. 
Wisconsin has maintained 26 county training schools upon this 
plan, but that number was increased to 30 in 1911, and additional 
inducements are offered for attendance in them. In Nebraska it has 
been found necessary to authorize the State superintendent to relax 
the requirements as to the designated schools in some of the western 
counties of the State. The conditions there are such as to make 
special consideration necessary. 
Summer normal courses.—Below the normal courses of high schools 
still another means of preparation has been found desirable in some 
of the States, for it is yet necessary to employ persons to teach who 
have had even less professional training than is given in the high-  
-P-A-G-E-122
  102 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
school courses. In Nebraska, for example, ‘‘junior normal schools,” 
continuing from 6 to 8 weeks each, have been conducted for sey- 
eral years, and in Wisconsin the “12 weeks’ courses in the theory 
and art of teaching” have become an established institution. The 
example of these States was followed in Colorado during the past 
year; the State was divided into six ‘‘teachers’ summer normal 
school districts,’ and it was provided that in each of them a summer 
normal school for the instruction of teachers and those desiring to 
teach shall be held annually for a term of not less than 6 weeks. The 
schools are controlled jointly by the county superintendents in the 
several districts and the board of trustees of the State Normal Col- 
lege at Greeley. The State contributes $10,000 to their mainte- 
nance, the commissioners of each county must appropriate $2 for each 
person attending from their respective counties, and a registration 
fee is collected from each student. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
The status of institutes is well determined in the majority of the 
States, and few new laws appear in relation to them. The most pro- 
gressive step reported in this connection was taken in Alabama. The 
institute work in that State has been somewhat fragmentary in the 
past, but the legislature of 1911 appropriated $6,500 for the employ- 
ment of conductors and provided for the compulsory attendance of 
all teachers except holders of life certificates, and for more syste- 
matic and effective management generally. 
In California the county superintendent was authorized to hold in 
his discretion local teachers’ institutes instead of the regular county 
nstitutes. School boards in Indiana were authorized to adjourn 
their schools for not exceeding three days in any year in order to 
allow the teachers to attend sessions of schools or institutes of agri- 
culture, or meetings of teachers’ associations, and to visit model 
schools; no deduction of salary shall be made for time so spent. An 
act was passed in Kansas to facilitate the holding of joint institutes 
by the less populous counties. 
COMPULSORY EDUCATION. 
No compulsory law that was wholly new was enacted during 1911, 
and the only territorial extension of the system by legislative action 
was in Arkansas and Tennessee, where additional counties were 
brought under the compulsory laws. A bill providing for a measure 
of compulsion failed in Florida, and the efforts of the previous year 
in this behalf in Georgia were not renewed because questions of gen- 
eral organization absorbed the attention of those concerned with 
educational legislation.
-P-A-G-E-123
  
EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION IN 1911. 103 
Important amendments, however, were made to existing laws in 
a number of States. Weak points frequently develop in carefully 
drawn measures, and new situations constantly arise, rendering minor 
changes necessary. But amendments that relate to compulsory 
attendance are usually due to advancing popular sentiment. Public 
opinion now demands a degree of stringency in many of the States 
that would not have been tolerated anywhere by the last generation, 
and the trend everywhere appears to be in the same direction. 
The most comprehensive law of the year in this relation is reported 
from Minnesota, and the most important feature of it is the provision 
for a complete school census for the purpose of informing the several 
teachers and officers what children are amenable to the law. Modi- 
fications are made, too, in other particulars, all tending to add to the 
strength and enforceability of the law. Poverty is omitted from the 
list of excuses that may be accepted for nonattendance, but, in 
response to a general demand, children over 14 outside the large 
cities may be excused between April 1 and November 1 if their help 
is required at home. 
It is usually the custom to refer to charity organizations cases in 
which children are prevented from attending school by lack of suit- 
able clothing and food. A departure from this custom is reported in 
Michigan, where an act (No. 198, 1911) authorizes boards of educa- 
tion in necessitous cases to contribute directly to the support of 
children in order to enable them to attend school. Such aid is limited 
to $3 a week for any child and to $6 a week for any family. Text- 
books may be supplied in addition. 
The length of the period of compulsion has for several years tended 
to increase. During 1911 three States added a year each, namely, 
California, North Dakota, and Vermont, and the compulsory ages in 
those States are now 8 to 15, 8 to 15, and 8 to 16, respectively. In 
Vermont the stipulation is added that. any child of 7 years of age 
who is enrolled as a pupil shall attend under the penalties provided 
for children between 8 and 16. In Oregon the compulsory period is 
now between 9 and 15, instead of between 8 and 14 as formerly. 
Truant officers were the subject of legislation in New Jersey, where 
their tenure was made dependent upon good behavior and. efficiency 
after one year’s service; in Oregon, where they are required to act 
as probation officers for juvenile courts in certain counties; in Mich- 
igan, where they must be appointed by the county school commis- 
sioner instead of by the sheriff, and must inspect sanitary conditions 
of schools; and in Minnesota, where they are required to report to the 
State superintendent of public instruction. 
Provisions for better means of enforcement of compulsory laws are 
constantly made as the need for them develops. Improvements in 
details were made in Wisconsin, New Hampshire, Missouri, Nevada, 
Oregon, and Massachusetts during 1911.

    104 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
CHILD LABOR. 
Comprehensive laws of great importance relating to child labor 
were passed during 1911 in Colorado, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri, 
New Hampshire, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and Wisconsin. All these 
States previously had laws that were more or less effective, but in no 
case did the old law compare with the new in completeness or in defi- 
niteness. The new measure of New Hampshire is especially compre- 
hensive and well drawn; that of Colorado is nearly as complete; and 
those of Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and Missouri are notable in that 
they greatly broaden the field of legal regulation, for in those States 
the previous enactments were of limited application. 
The most advanced laws prohibit employment before the age of 16 
unless the child has completed the eighth elementary grade, but that 
standard is still considered too high in most of the States. Ability to 
read understandingly and to write legibly-is all the education that is 
required in New Hampshire and Colorado for children between 14 and 
16, and that is as far as the requirements of the majority of the States 
go. The new law in Utah apparently does not clearly express its full 
meaning, and some of the ideas that seem to have been in the minds 
of its authors will probably fail of realization. There is enough in it 
that is enforceable, however, to constitute a marked advance. 
The Michigan law mentioned above amends previous acts, but its 
scope is such that it is entitled to be classed as an important general 
law. One of its provisions demands especial mention, namely, that 
of limited ‘‘vacation permits,’’ for which all educational qualifications 
are waived, though all other requirements of the law must be enforced. 
As the name indicates, they are issued only during the summer vaca- 
tion. Another paragraph provides for age certificates for persons 
over 16 years of age. Such certificates are issued in cities by officers 
of the State department of labor, or in the absence of such an officer 
by the superintendent of schools. Proper proof of age must be 
required by the issuing officer, and the certificates may be accepted by 
employers at their face value; if the holder of the certificate should 
prove to be younger than the age stated in the certificate the employer 
will not be liable to prosecution. The advantage of such protection 
is manifest. é 
The Indiana statute mentioned relates particularly to the hours 
and character of work of minors, and its effect upon the schools is 
indirect only, since no clause in it relates specifically to school 
attendance. 
The hours of employment of children are regulated by law in a con- 
stantly increasing number of States. The ‘‘Osborne law” in New 
Jersey prohibits the employment of any child under 16 in a mercantile 
establishment for more than 58 hours per week, or between 7 p. m. 
and 7 a. m., except during the Christmas season. Other recent laws
-P-A-G-E-125
  
EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION IN 1911. 105 
fix maximum weekly working hours as follows: Colorado, Missouri, 
and Wisconsin, for persons under 16, 48 hours; New York and Indiana, 
under 16, 54 hours; Utah, boys under 14 and girls under 16, 54 hours; 
New Hampshire, boys under 16 and girls under 18, 58 hours; North 
Carolina, under 18, 60 hours. In California, persons under 18 are 
prohibited from working between 10 p. m. and 5 a. m.; the former 
law applied only to persons under 16. 
The campaign of the National Child Labor Committee for better 
messenger laws has lost none of its vigor. The Kichler law in Utah 
prohibits the employment of any person under 21 as a messenger in 
any city of the first or second class between 9 p. m. and 5 a. m., and 
forbids any minor to deliver goods or messages at any time to ques- 
tionable resorts. Laws with a similar purpose, though differing in 
details, were recently enacted also in New Jersey, Michigan, Wis- 
consin, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, and New Hampshire. 
In Delaware a commission has been constituted to investigate the 
laws in relation to child labor and to prepare a comprehensive bill 
upon the subject for presentation to the next general assembly. 
SCHOOL CENSUS. 
Constant improvement is manifest in the school census of the 
several States, not only because of improved laws relating to the 
census itself, but because of the closer attention given to children in 
their homes as the result of the compulsory attendance acts. Many 
truant officers can readily make an accurate school census of the 
territory under their charge without leaving their offices, so complete 
are the records and their knowledge of the children for whose attend- 
ance they are responsible. Notwithstanding all this, unaccountable 
errors frequently occur in the reported figures, and no law seems 
stringent enough to wholly prevent carelessness on the part of 
enumerators. New statutes continue to appear as new remedies are 
suggested. In Michigan it was enacted that each enumerator shall 
make affidavit that he made a house-to-house canvass in the territory 
assigned to him. In Maine a more radical measure was passed, which 
will be effective against gross errors that are apparent on the face of 
the returns. The governor and council may require a school census 
to be retaken in any town when upon report of the State superin- 
tendent of schools it is apparent that such census was inaccurately 
taken in that town. 
Two laws of the year relating to school census counterbalance each 
other: Minnesota inaugurated such work, and California discon- 
tinued it. A new compulsory attendance law was the moving reason 
for the Minnesota census, and the changed basis of apportionment in 
California, by which average attendance was substituted for school 
population, led to the repeal of the census law in that State.

  106 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
TRANSPORTATION OF PUPILS. 
In a previous section of this paper transportation was discussed as 
it affected the consolidation of districts; but there are many condi- 
tions that demand legal regulation or authorization of transportation 
without requiring a change in the organization of any district. The 
means and methods of transportation are generally understood, and 
the laws that relate to the subject usually refer to details. A few of 
them are of more than passing importance, however. 
A variation from the usual provisions for transportation is found 
in the Minnesota law granting aid to consolidated districts. The 
school board of such a district is authorized to pay a reasonable 
amount for board and lodging in lieu of transportation of pupils liv- 
ing at a distance from the schoolhouse. Another unusual develop- 
ment is the South Dakota law (chap. 141), which provides that when 
transportation is not furnished the school district shall pay to the 
parents or guardians of pupils living from 2} to 3 miles from the near- 
est schoolhouse 10 cents per day of actual attendance; of those living 
3 to 4 miles, 25 cents per day; 4 to 5 miles, 35 cents; 5 to 6 miles, 45 
cents. 
These two enactments are examples of the unexpected results that 
sometimes follow new lines of legislation. In one case public funds 
not only furnish free tuition with all that it implies, but also pay a 
part of the board and lodging of the pupil; in the other case the parent 
is paid in cash for sending his child to school, for there is no require- 
ment that he shall transport the child. In neither case does the 
element of charity enter. 
It is by no means unusual to pay parents for transporting their own 
children, although in some States that practice is not permitted. In 
Towa it was but recently enacted (chap. 148, 1911) that the school 
board of a consolidated district may require that children living an 
unreasonable distance from school shall be transported by the parent 
or guardian a distance not exceeding 2 miles to connect with the 
school wagon, and the board shall allow reasonable compensation for 
the transportation to and from the point where the children are taken 
over by the wagon. 
Other laws upon the general subject of transportation were enacted 
during the year in California, where pupils may be transported at the 
cost of the county to county high schools; in Kansas, where any dis- 
trict board may provide transportation for pupils living more than 
24 miles from school; in Missouri, where the limit of distance is only 
one-half mile; in New Hampshire, where school districts were author- 
ized to purchase necessary vehicles; and in Pennsylvania, where it 
is provided that no pupil of a discontinued school shall be required to 
walk more than a mile and a half to a consolidated school.

EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION IN 1911, 107 
HOLIDAYS. 
In Rome in the time of the Republic 64 days in every year were 
devoted to public festivals recognized by law. The American Repub- 
lic has not reached such a number of holidays, but its schools sur- 
passed it long ago. The summer vacation, the Saturday holiday, 
short sessions or no sessions on stormy days, teachers’ institutes, 
visiting days, sundry legal holidays, and days of special observance 
have so lessened the actual school time that scarcely more than half 
the days in the year as a rule are given to regular school work. This 
is a fact so universal that it rarely excites comment; yet it was not so 
in the earlier days. Seventy years ago, or thereabouts, the schools 
of Buffalo were in session all the year round; those of Brooklyn, Balti- 
more, and Cincinnati, 11 months; New York City, 49 weeks; Chicago, 
48 weeks; Philadelphia, 251 days; Detroit, 259 days; Washington, 
238 days; Boston, 224 days, etc. The change has come about so 
gradually that it has searcely been noticed. The most recent move- 
ment that affects the situation in this regard is that for the adoption 
of Columbus Day as a public holiday. Nine States, namely, Dela- 
ware, Indiana, Kansas, Maine, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas, 
and Vermont, have during the past year designated October 12 as a 
legal holiday to celebrate the discovery of America. 
But signs of a reaction have begun to appear. The Denagri law in 
California reduces the number of school holidays to Saturdays, Sun- 
days, January 1, May 30, July 4, December 25, and Thanksgiving Day. 
All other legal holidays must be observed by appropriate exercises, but 
not by closing the schools. Similar action was taken in the Legisla- 
ture of Michigan, but in that State Labor Day is classed as a holiday. 
In Pennsylvania the new code provides (sec. 2109) that ‘‘the time 
in attendance at the annual teachers’ institute shall not be considered 
as days taught or lessen the actual number of days in the minimum 
school term.”’ The old law provided that the schools should be closed 
during the sessions of institutes and that teachers should be paid for 
attendance, but stipulated that 20 days actual teaching should con- 
tinue to constitute a school month. The new provision leaves no 
doubt of its meaning. In this respect it is in marked contrast to the 
statutes of some of the other States, which not only provide that the 
time spent in teachers’ institutes shall be counted as school time, but 
that in compiling the records of aggregate attendance of pupils a pro- 
portionate number shall be allowed as representing attendance on 
institute days, although no school was then in session. 
TEXTBOOKS. 
In most of the States the textbook question appears to have been 
settled with a degree of definiteness, for there has been a noticeable 
cessation of activity in legislation upon that subject. Only two 
 
-P-A-G-E-128
  
  108 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
important book laws were reported during the past year, namely, those 
of Florida and Minnesota. In the former State, county uniformity 
has been the rule for the past 10 years, and the State-wide system 
was logically the next step in progress. The new law constitutes the 
board of commissioners of State institutions as a State textbook com- 
mission, and also creates a subcommission of nine professional teach- 
ers and school officers. The usual duties of selection, contract, etc., 
are vested in these boards, and penalties are provided for the use of 
any book not upon the adopted list, and for overcharge on the part of 
contractors. : 
The previous conditions in Minnesota were not by any means bad 
as a whole, and the new enactment of that State was for the regula-’ 
tion of publishers and of prices rather than of the general system: 
itself. 
A general investigation of the textbook situation in Wisconsin has’ 
been ordered by the legislature of that State, the purpose being the, 
correction of any abuses that may be found to exist, particularly in’ 
the sale of books. 
A uniform system of blank books and records for all school dis-' 
tricts has been provided for in Kansas; the minimum equipment of 
every schoolroom has been prescribed in South Dakota; the partici-' 
pation of county officials and school-teachers and officers in school 
contracts has been forbidden in North Dakota; the composition of 
the subcommission on textbooks of North Carolina has been altered; 
and similar changes of secondary importance were reported from 
other States. 
FIRE DRILL; INSTRUCTION IN FIRE DANGERS. 
In Iowa, Michigan, and Pennsylvania the office of State fire mar- 
shal was created during the year, and in each case the office was 
charged with duties in connection with schools. 
_ In Towa the fire marshal and his deputies must require teachers of 
public and private schools to have fire drills and to see that all doors 
and exits are kept unlocked during school hours. He must prepare 
and publish a bulletin upon the causes and dangers of fires, and 
teachers in all public schools shall instruct their pupils at least once 
each quarter in the matters covered by the bulletin. 
Similar provisions were made in Pennsylvania, but more constant 
class instruction is contemplated in that State, for it is enacted that 
the curriculum of the public and private schools of the State shall 
include some regular and continuous study of the dangers of fire and 
the prevention of fire waste during the entire school year. 
The Michigan law provides neither for the publication of bulletins 
nor for such classroom instruction, but it does require the State fire 
marshal and his deputies to enforce monthly fire drills and to see that 
exits are kept unlocked.
-P-A-G-E-129
  
EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION IN 1911. 109 
In Nebraska the first Friday in November was designated ‘‘State 
Fire Day,” and must be observed in all public, private, and parochial 
schools with appropriate exercises. A book for instruction in fire 
dangers and fire prevention must be prepared by the State fire com- 
missioner and the State superintendent of public instruction. A 
copy must be furnished to every teacher, and instruction must be 
given from it for at least 30 minutes in every school month. 
MEDICAL INSPECTION. 
No general compulsory medical inspection laws were passed during 
1911, but two additional States have required periodical examina- 
tions of the eyes and ears of all pupils, compulsory laws of limited 
application were passed in two other States, and several excellent 
permissive laws were enacted. 
Medical inspection was the subject of animated discussion in 
Pennsylvania during the consideration of the new school code, and 
it was vigorously debated in both houses of the legislature. The 
provisions finally enacted were the result of compromise. Each 
district with a population of over 5,000 is required to provide pro- 
fessional medical inspection, and the State department of health is 
directed to furnish similar inspection for all pupils in districts having 
less than 5,000 inhabitants. The board of directors of any district 
having less than 30,000 inhabitants may, however, suspend the 
operation of the law in that district; and if the parent of any child 
so desires, the examination of that child must be made in the presence 
of the parent. These two provisions were plainly inserted to meet 
the objections of those who opposed compulsory inspection. They 
are so worded that as experience proves the value of the measure the 
extent of its application will increase almost automatically, for 
positive action is required for its suspension rather than for its 
adoption. 
It is probable that this law, notwithstanding its nonobligatory 
features, will prove more effective as a whole than those laws that 
require local authorities to provide inspection, even though that 
requirement is general in its scope. The direction and control of 
the inspectors in the rural districts by a State board is a novel pro- 
vision whose success can scarcely be doubted. The inspection con- 
templated will cover not only the physical condition of the pupils, 
but the sanitary conditions of the schools themselves. The same 
article authorizes the employment of school nurses, and forbids any 
person having tuberculosis of the lungs to be a pupil, teacher, or 
janitor or other employee of any public school unless it be a special 
school under the regulations of the commissioner of health. 
The West Virginia Legislature passed an act requiring the board 
of education in every independent district to appoint a medical 
 
-P-A-G-E-130
  
  110 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
inspector and authorizing like boards in magisterial districts to 
appoint such officers. . 
In Indiana an excellent medical-inspection measure was coupled 
with the sanitary schoolhouse bill to which reference was made on 
page 90. Both passed, but the inspection bill was amended so that 
its adoption was made optional with local authorities. This law 
contains a clause that is worthy of note as forestalling the objections 
that are most frequently urged against such laws. A certificate from 
a reputable physician that he has examined a certain child and has 
notified its parents of the result will be accepted in lieu of examination 
by the school physician. A parent, therefore, may have his children 
examined by the family physician if he prefers not to subject them 
to examination by a stranger. 
Medical-inspection laws, optional in their terms, were passed in 
Vermont and Rhode Island also. In the latter State half the expense 
will be borne by the State, but no one city or town may receive over 
$250 annually. The Rhode Island law provides also that an examina- 
tion of the sight and hearing of all pupils shall be made annually 
either by teachers or school physicians. A similar requirement was 
enacted in Utah, and in that State the breathing habits of each pupil 
must also be noted, the evident purpose being the detection of 
adenoids. 
The health laws of North Carolina were extensively amended by 
the past legislature, and one of the new paragraphs assigns to the 
county superintendent of health in certain counties the duties of 
“quarantine officer.’ These include the inspection of all school 
buildings and the examination of all pupils who are reported by 
their respective teachers to be defective in eyes, ears, nose, or throat, 
and also the examination, if practicable, of the feces of every child 
whom he suspects of having hookworm disease. If the examination 
of a child discloses any organic defect or hookworm disease, the 
superintendent of health must suggest to the parent the proper 
course of treatment and urge that such treatment be procured. 
He must also ‘‘through the county press, public addresses, and in 
every available way, endeavor to educate the people of his county 
to set a higher value on health, and to adopt such public and private 
measures as will tend to the greater conservation of life.” Unfortu- 
nately the application of this law extends to not more than two 
counties of the State. 
In addition to the foregoing, several laws were passed during the 
year upon specific subjects relating to hygiene and sanitation. 
In California the provisions relating to vaccination of school children 
were modified so that the requirement will not be enforced except 
when there is danger of an epidemic of smallpox. 
 
-P-A-G-E-131
  
EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION IN 1911. 111 
The use of common drinking cups was forbidden in New Jersey, 
Illinois, and Ohio, and the installation of sanitary fountains, whenever 
it is practicable, was enjoined in Indiana. The Legislature of Oregon 
authorized school boards to exclude any pupil who is affected with 
vermin or uncleanliness.

INTRODUCTION. 
In summing up tendencies in city school systems during the first 
decade of the twentieth century, the commission appointed to study 
the system of education in the public schools of Baltimore, of which 
Dr. Elmer Ellsworth Brown was chairman, said in its report:* 
On the side of school administration certain tendencies have been apparent during 
the decade, among which the following may be mentioned: The movement to reduce 
the number of members of school boards, the increasing demand for the removal of 
the schools from the influence of partisan politics, and the employment of specialists 
in different departments of the business management and the scholastic supervision 
f the educational system. As regards the teaching force, it may be said that the 
itvend has been in the direction of higher salaries and the requirement of superior 
ualifications and greater efficiency. Closer supervision, a more flexible course of 
tudy for high schools, provision of special classes for exceptional children, more 
aried and more specialized teaching in the upper elementary grades, a closer adap-

tation of the ordinary school work to the ordinary needs of life, and provision in con- 
tinuation schools for children who are compelled to go to work early in life are some 
features of educational endeavor that have been uppermost of late in the minds of 
our educational authorities. 
The decade has been marked by the extension of the school system to include 
various special activities, such as those of social and recreation centers, playgrounds, 
school gardens, baths, school lunchrooms, and savings banks operated by pupils in 
school, all of which seem destined to render the school more widely serviceable to 
the people. 
Within the decade some movements of still larger significance have made notable 
headway. Perhaps the most important of these has appeared in the demand for 
vocational training. Within the past decade the emphasis in manual training has 
shifted from the cultural to the vocational aim, and now many school systems offer 
training which looks directly to a vocation in the industries. In addition to this 
industrial training, commercial courses and courses in domestic economy for girls 
have grown in popularity and are now widely offered in public schools. 
The purpose of this chapter is to state more at length the tenden- 
cies that may be traced through the last years of the decade in 
question and through the year 1910-11. It is, however, not 
attempted to give every item of progress in each city, nor to men- 
tion every possible example of items that are given, but rather to 
bring together and summarize the more significant progressive steps.   I. ADMINISTRATIVE CHANGES. 
School administration now tends toward centralization. This is 
seen in the reduction of the number of members of school boards and 
their appointment or election at large instead of by wards, in the 
concentration of control on the business side in business experts, 
and in the extension of professional control. 
The tendency to reduce the number of members of school boards, 
which has engaged the attention of school administrators for a score 
of years or more and which received a marked impetus in 1905, when 
Boston reduced the number of members of its school committee 
from 24 to 5, has received further momentum during the past year. 
The most notable examples of this tendency are the cities of Penn- 
sylvania; Louisville, Ky., and New York City. 
By an act of the General Assembly of Pennsylvania, approved 
May 18, 1911, a new school code was adopted which entirely reor- 
ganized the public-school system of the State. Under the provisions 
of this act each city, incorporated town, borough, or township is 
constituted a separate school district, and districts thus established 
are divided into four classes according to population as shown by 
the United States census. Each separate school district is now 
administered by a “board of school directors,” the number of mem- 
bers depending upon the class to which the district belongs. The 
classification of the different districts, with the number of directors 
to which each class is entitled under this act, is as follows:
-P-A-G-E-137

au03h 
  There are now in the State two districts of the first class—Philadel- 
phia and Pittsburgh. Fourteen cities in the State are entitled to the 
rank of district of the second class. After each Federal census the 
State superintendent of public instruction shall make a reclassifica- 
tion upon the basis of population shown. 
The number of members of the Philadelphia school board is by this 
act reduced from 21 to 15. Under the old law the central board of 
education of Pittsburgh was composed of 45 members, elected by. 
the local boards of the subdistricts into which the city was divided. 
The reduction of this number to 15 involves therefore a more radical 
change than that in Philadelphia, but in some of the smaller cities 
the ratio of reduction is even greater. In Harrisburg the board for- 
merly consisted of 32 members; in Reading, of 64 members; in 
Williamsport, of 52 members. According to the census of 1910 each 
of these cities will under the new school code have a board of school 
directors consisting of 9 members only. 
In many of the cities of the State the school boards were formerly 
composed of members elected by wards or subdistricts practically 
coterminous with wards. This was the case in Pittsburgh, where the 
45 subdistricts were in most cases coterminous with the wards of the 
city. Under the provisions of the new code all school directors are 
now appointed or elected at large. Sections 207 and 208, which relate 
to the eligibility of school directors, are as follows: 
Src. 207. Any citizen of this Commonwealth, having a good moral character, being 
twenty-one years of age or upwards, and having been a resident of the district for at 
least one year prior to the date of his election or appointment, shall be eligible to the 
office of school director therein: Provided, That any person holding the office of mayor; 
chief burgess; county commissioner; district attorney; city, borough, or township 
treasurer; city councilman; township commissioner; road supervisor; tax collector; 
comptroller; auditor; or constable—shall not be eligible as a school director in this 
Commonwealth. 
Src. 208. Any person who has held any office of trust or profit under the laws of the 
United States or of this Commonwealth, or in any county, city, borough, or township 
therein, and has been removed therefrom for any malfeasance in office, shall not be 
eligible to the office of school director. 
In districts of the first class, school directors are appointed by the 
judges of the courts of common pleas of the counties in which the dis- 
tricts are respectively situated. After the expiration of the terms of
-P-A-G-E-138
  118 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
the first appointees such appointments will be made for a term of six 
years, five members being appointed every two years. In districts 
of the second, third, and fourth classes directors are elected by vote 
of the people at the regular municipal election. As in the case of 
districts of the first class the term of office is six years, and as nearly 
as possible one-third of the members are to be elected every three 
years. 
By an act approved March 4, 1910, the boards of education of 
cities of the first class in Kentucky were fixed at five members each. 
Louisville is the only city of the first class in the State. Under the 
provisions of this act the number of members of the board of education 
of that city was reduced from 16 to 5, the new board being elected by 
the vote of the people and at large instead of by wards, as was for- 
merly the custom. The term of office is four years. Elections are 
held biennially, two members being elected at one election and three 
at the succeeding election. As provided in the act, the new board 
was elected in November, 1910, and began its duties January 1, 1911. 
A bill embodying far-reaching changes in the administration of the 
public schools of the city of New York was introduced in the legisla- 
ture of the State early in 1911, but at the time of this writing it has 
not become a law. The bill provides for the enactment of a new 
charter for the city, and the chapter devoted to thé department of 
education abolishes the separate corporate existence of the board of 
education and makes the board a department of the city govern- 
ment. Under the provisions of the bill the personnel of the new 
department shall consist of a president and six other members, 
who shall be known as commissioners of education. After the expi- 
ration of the initial term each member is to be appointed for a term 
of seven years, one member being appointed each year. Appoint- 
ments are to be made by the mayor of the city. The bill provides 
compensation of $10,000 a year for the president of the board and 
$9,000 a year for each of the other six members. If enacted into law, 
this bill would reduce the number of members of the school board from 
46 to 7. 
By an act of the General Court of Massachusetts approved March 
18, 1910, the number of members of the school committee of the city 
of ‘Newton was reduced from 15 to 8. 
The final effects of the present tendency to reduce the number of 
members of school boards can not of course be foreseen, but the 
enactment of such laws as that embodied in the new Pennsylvania 
school code will without doubt give impetus to the movement. The 
Pennsylvania Code represents one of the most significant steps taken 
in recent years toward the standardization of school administrative 
units and should exert a wholesome influence on other sections of the 
country.

REMOVAL FROM PARTISAN POLITICS. 
Coincident with the reduction of the number of members of school 
boards it is usually provided that members shall be elected from the 
city at large and. not as representatives of the several wards. Elec- 
tion at large is an outgrowth of the conviction that partisan politics, 
which is often found where the ward system of representation pre- 
vails, should be eliminated from the administration of school affairs. 
It is urged that boards of few members, each of whom is elected to 
represent all the people, can be kept freer from political influences 
than can boards of latge membership chosen by the local electorate 
of subdistricts or wards. 
On the necessity of the removal of the schools from the influence of 
partisan politics there is unanimity among educators. The school 
system should have nothing in common with a local political machine, 
and wherever the two are brought into relation the schools suffer. As 
the people come to see this fact more clearly, the demand grows for 
the complete separation of politics and school administration. 
It is worthy of note in this connection that the Kentucky law, to 
which reference has already been made, makes special provision 
against partisan political influences in the election of members of the 
school board, though the election is held at the same time as for 
other municipal officers. No public officer, except a notary public 
or an officer of the State militia, may be a member of the school 
board. Separate ballots and ballot boxes must be used for the elec- 
tion of members, and provision is made against giving voters infor- 
mation as to the political affiliations of any candidate. The new 
Pennsylvania Code provides that directors in cities of the first class 
shall be appointed by the judges of the courts of common pleas, thus 
seeking to remove their selection from political influences. While 
the election of directors in districts of the other three classes is held 
at the regular municipal election, the qualifications for eligibility 
prescribed in sections 207 and 208 will tend to prevent activity on 
the part of local politicians. 
BUSINESS EXPERTS. 
In some of the larger cities of the country experts in mercantile 
affairs are now employed, whose duties on the material side of school 
administration are coordinate with those of the superintendent on 
the educational side. This business manager, or business director, is 
the executive officer of the school board in business transactions. In 
this, Cleveland, Ohio, was the pioneer, the office of ‘‘director of 
schools” having been in existence there since the enactment of the 
law of March 8, 1892, which reorganized the board of education. 
Indianapolis, Ind., has employed a ‘‘business director” since 1900. 
In 1906, after the reorganization of the school committee, a ‘‘ business 
    
 
-P-A-G-E-140
    
120 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
, manager” was elected in Boston at a salary of $3,780. Cincinnati 
followed in 1908 with the creation of a similar office. Houston, Tex., 
has employed a ‘‘business representative”’ since 1905. 
During the past two years three other important cities have added 
such officers to their corps of administrative officials. By provision 
in the act of the General Assembly of Kentucky, approved March 4, 
1910, the position of ‘‘business director” was created in Louisville. 
In his annual report for 1910 President Alfred R. Urion, of the Chicago 
board of education, urged the adoption of a plan ‘‘whereby there 
shall be one business head charged with the full responsibility, as is 
done on the educational side in the case of the superintendent of 
schools.” In accordance with President Urion’s recommendation, 
the position was created and a business manager was appointed in 
January, 1911. 
The office of ‘‘executive agent”’ was created in Minneapolis, Minn., 
in 1909, but some difficulty was experienced in securing a person of 
the qualifications sought, and the position was not filled until June, 
1911. 
The rules and regulations of the board of education of that city 
prescribe the following as the duties of the executive agent, and they 
may be considered as typical of the functions of officers of this class: 
The executive agent, as provided in section 11, shall have-direct supervision over 
the school properties and the maintenance thereof. He shall generally represent the 
board in all negotiations relating to the construction, reconstruction, repair, and 
maintenance of school properties. He shall supervise the purchase, receipt, and dis- 
tribution of all supplies, books, and materials, as authorized by the board. All 
requisitions for the delivery of supplies shall be approved by him. 
He shall have authority to engage and discharge such employees as are necessary 
to the conduct of the activities expressed herein and shall report thereon to the com- 
mittee on buildings and supplies for the final approval of the board. 
He shall, prior to the first regular meeting of the board in June of each year, prepare 
a list of janitors and other employees for the various schools and such list shall have 
attached thereto the salary proposed to be paid each person therein shown. Such 
list, when approved over the signature of the executive agent, shall be delivered by 
him to the committee on buildings and supplies for submission to the board. 
He shall submit to the board monthly a report considering in appropriate detail 
information relating to the construction, reconstruction, repair, and distribution of 
school supplies, with such suggestions as may be appropriate thereto. 
He shall attend all meetings of the board and, when requested, the meetings of 
standing committees. 
He shall devote his entire time to the interests of the board, and maintain such 
regular hours as may be prescribed by the board, at its office. - 
He shall give a bond for the faithful performance of his duties, in such sum as the 
board may determine. 
PROFESSIONAL CONTROL. 
On the side of professional control, the tendency has been toward 
closer supervision of school work and increased authority and respon- 
sibility for the superintendent and his supervisory staff. In 1906
-P-A-G-E-141
  
  RECENT PROGRESS IN CITY SCHOOLS. 121 
the Bureau of Education reported 6,600 supervising officers and 
‘106,026 teachers in cities of 8,000 population and over. For the 
year 1909-10 the corresponding numbers were 11,144 and 125,246, 
respectively. Thus, during a period of five years, the increase of 
supervising officers was 68.8 per cent while that of teachers was only 
18.1 per cent. The ratio of teachers to supervisors in 1906 was 16.6; 
in 1910 it was only 11.2. While the more comprehensive wording of 
the question relating to supervising officers in the schedule sent out 
in 1909 and again in 1910 resulted in an apparent abnormal increase 
over the year 1908 and previous years, this does not account alto- 
gether for the preponderance over the increase in teachers. In a 
single year, from 1909 to 1910, when the schedules used were identical, 
the increase of supervisors in cities of the same class was 10.87 per 
cent, while that of teachers was only 3.96 per cent. These figures 
of the Bureau of Education show the tendency toward a closer pro- 
fessional supervision of the schools. 
Il. TEACHERS’ SALARIES. 
Tn his annual report for 1909, Supt. Frank M. Martin, of El Paso, 
Tex., aptly stated the case of the inadequacy of teachers’ salaries. 
by pointing out that American cities pay their policemen more. to 
take their youth to jail than they pay their teachers to keep them 
out. Supt. Martin might have expressed himself even more strongly, 
for in some cities the employees of the street-cleaning department, 
popularly known as ‘‘white wings,” receive an annual wage greater 
than that of some teachers. 
It is evident, however, that the cause of the teacher is receiving 
more consideration. Various cities report increases in salaries and 
readjustments of schedules in order to provide increased pay. From 
statistics collected and compiled by the Bureau of Education it 
appears that the average cost of teaching and supervision per pupil 
in daily attendance increased from $20.10 to $27.98, a gain of 39.2 
per cent, during the decade from 1900 to 1910. Between the years 
1908 and 1910 expenditure for supervision and teaching in cities of 
8,000 population and over increased 18 per cent, while the increase 
in the number of supervisors and teachers combined was only 11.7 
per cent. Thus expenditure for salaries is shown to be increasing 
at a more rapid rate than is the number of supervisors and 
teachers. 
In January, 1910, the board of estimate and apportionment of 
the city of New York passed a resolution providing for the appoint- 
ment of a commission ‘‘to investigate the justice, economy, and 
adequacy of the present and proposed schedules of salaries for the 
payment of teachers of the department of education.” While the 
main purpose of the commission was to investigate the matter of the  
-P-A-G-E-142

equalization of salaries of men and women teachers, the whole 
question of salaries was considered, and the conditions in other large © 
cities were studied. The following tables are taken from the report 
of the commission, which was made in October, 1910:

A comparison may be made of salaries reported in 1911 to the 
Bureau of Education with those reported in 1905 by the committee 
appointed by the National Education Association to study and 
report on ‘‘Salaries, tenure, and pensions of public-school teachers 
in the United States.” In the following table are presented the 
minimum and maximum salaries of elementary teachers in repre- 
sentative cities of 10,000 population and over which reported both 
to the committee of the National Education Association and to the 
Bureau of Edveation. The last two columns show increases in both 
minimum and maximum salaries. It is significant that of all the 
cities for which figures were available for comparison, only one city 
reported a decrease.

Ill. MEASURING THE SCHOOL’S EFFICIENCY. 
STUDIES OF ELIMINATION AND RETARDATION. 
A wholesome sign of progress in city school work is the wide recog- 
nition of the need of greater efficiency in the school system, with the 
effort to measure present efficiency. It is now generally admitted 
that there is need of a closer adaptation of the work of the school to 
the ordinary needs of life. It is believed that the dwindling of classes 
in the upper grades of our elementary schools, which has been often 
noted in recent years, indicates weakness in the schools at some point 
or points, and that a remedy for that weakness should be found and 
applied. This. belief has led to a number of studies of the amount and 
causes of the elimination and retardation of pupils. Most notable 
among these are three that were made by Dr. Edward L. Thorndike, 
Dr. Leonard P. Ayres, and Dr. George D. Strayer, respectively. In 
1907 Dr. Elmer E. Brown, then Commissioner of Education of the 
United States, recognizing the need of an intensive and thorough 
study of the extent and causes of the withdrawal of pupils from 
school, engaged Prof. Edward L. Thorndike, of Teachers College, 
Columbia University, to prepare for the Bureau of Education a 
monograph on that subject. The result was ‘Bulletin, 1907, No. 4: 
The Elimination of Pupils from School,” a work which attracted 
wide attention and marked the beginning of the more recent interest 
in the subject. In this study Prof. Thorndike’s effort was mainly to 
show the amount of elimination. The results of his investigation are 
summarized in the following statement: 
I estimate that the general tendency of American cities of 25,000 population and 
over is, or was about 1900, to keep in school out of 100 entering pupils 90 till grade 4, 
81 till grade 5, 68 till grade 6,-54 till grade 7, 40 till the last grammar grade (usually the 
eighth, but sometimes the ninth, and rarely the seventh), 27 till the first high-school 
grade, 17 till the second, 12 till the third, and 8 till the fourth. 
In 1909 the Russell Sage Foundation of New York City, published* 
a monograph on the retardation and elimination of pupils from school, 
which presented results materially differing from those obtained by 
Prof. Thorndike. This difference was due to different methods 
employed in obtaining the number of pupils entering school in a given 
year, which number must be found before the amount of retardation 
can be determined. Prof. Thorndike calculated the number of enter- 
ing pupils by taking the average of the enrollment in the first three 
grades and making slight corrections. Dr. Ayres obtained the num- 
ber entering by applying to present enrollment certain percentages 
which were obtained by taking into account retardation, elimination, 
and increase in population. The difference in results as pointed out 
by Dr. Ayres is shown in the following table:

The differences indicated are surprising, but both authors agree 
that by far too small a percentage of pupils fail to complete the course 
in the elementary grades, and both have exerted a wide influence on 
efforts at the measurement of the school’s efficiency. It is largely 
through such studies that the waste places will be found, causes will be 
discovered, and means will be devised for correcting the school’s faults. 
Already a decided impetus has been given to the study of the 
problem, as a perusal of recent annual reports of city superintendents 
will show. Of about 100 such reports from important cities about 
one-half discussed elimination or retardation or both. Most of these 
discussions are illuminating and all represent earnest study; many of 
them show the amount of elimination and retardation, mention 
causes, and propose remedies. The causes of withdrawals from 
school vary with different cities, depending in large measure upon 
economic and social conditions and upon the general educational spirit 
of the community, but in general it may be said that there are many 
elements common toallcities. Supt. Randall J.Condon, of Providence, 
R. L., found that of 122 grammar-school graduates who did not enter 
the Providence high schools upon their graduation in February, 1910, 
“the majority had a definite reason for not attending high school,” 
but ‘‘little time or attention had been directed toward their imme- 
diate or future work.” 
In 1909-10, 969 pupils withdrew from the public schools of Coy- 
ington, Ky. Supt. Homer O. Sluss found the cause of withdrawal 
of all but 51. He says: 
The statistical table shows that 409, or 9.2 per cent, of the total enrollment and 42.2 
per cent of the total number of withdrawals moved out of the city, indicating a large 
shifting population; 198 withdrew on account of personal illness; 53 because of illness 
in the family and 5 because of failing eyesight; 25 withdrew because of financial 
conditions of the home, while 128 others left school to seek employment; 33 withdrew 
because of indifference; 12 because of failure to secure promotion, and 6 because of 
incapacity to do the work. 
Savannah, Ga., offers an example of the causes of withdrawal in a 
city in which there is no compulsory education law in force. For the 
1,203 withdrawals of white pupils in that city in 1909-10, Supt. Otis 
Ashmore found the following causes: “Death, 6; ill health, 140; 
removal from city, 341; transfer to other schools in system, 260;
-P-A-G-E-146
    126 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
bad behavior, 52; to go to work, 91; nonattendance, 191: failure to 
keep up with grade, 55; change of grade, 67.” 
The foregoing extracts show a decided interest in the study of the 
causes of elimination; the causes of retardation, though more elusive, 
have recently received even more attention. One of the most note- 
worthy studies of these causes was that made by Supt. William H. 
Maxwell, of New York City. Early in the school year 1909-10 Supt. 
Maxwell appointed eight committees of principals to study the whole 
question and report to him. Dr. Maxwell’s summary of their findings 
is worthy of quotation: ! 
The eight committees were in substantial accord in stating that the following are 
the chief causes of failure on the part of pupils to secure regular promotion from grade 
to grade. The causes, however, are not stated in any order of intensity: 
Irregular attendance, due to poor home conditions; looseness of parental control; 
ignorance of parents; lack of opportunities for home study; poverty of home requir- 
ing pupils’ assistance; sickness of other members of the family; lack of proper cloth- 
ing; feeble health of individual pupils; poverty of surroundings. 
Truancy, which is attributed by the principals to three chief causes: Lack of sup- 
port by the courts in enforcing the compulsory-education law, lack of cooperation of 
parents, and lack of a sufficient number of attendance officers. 
Ignorance of the English language, due to foreign birth and to the fact that English 
is not the language of the home. 
Late entrance into school, due to two causes: The presence of immigrant children, 
and the fact that many children are sent to private schools before they enter the pub- 
lie schools. 
Transfer from school to school.—Such transfers involve loss of time owing to varia- 
tions in the interpretation of the course of study and syllabuses and in following 
different sequences of topics in different schools and frequently to delay in entering 
school after removal from one school district to another school district. 
Physical defects —These are caused or intensified by lack of medical care; nervous 
troubles; adenoid growths and enlarged tonsils; defective eyes, ears, and teeth; 
malnutrition; physical precocity; lack of play and exercise; unsanitary conditions. 
Sluggish mentality Sometimes this feature takes the form of positive mental defect 
and sometimes it characterizes pupils as slow in receptivity and response. Some- 
times it takes the form of moral defects, such as dishonesty, lying, and cheating, 
which are intensified by improper reading, the following of bad examples, and petty 
defiance of law in the streets. 
Excessive size of classes, which prevents teachers giving necessary individual 
instruction. 
Prolonged or frequent absences of teachers, during which their classes are taught by 
substitutes who are sometimes indifferent and sometimes inefficient. 
Part time, which prevents pupils from doing the work of the lower grades thor- 
oughly. 
Varying standards of rating pupils—Some principals and teachers adopt too high a 
standard; some too low a standard. 
Inefficient teaching, due to teachers’ talking and doing too much for their pupils; 
lack of thoroughness; obsolete aims and methods in teaching on the part of some of 
the older teachers; occasional lack of the power of discipline; neglect of opportunity 
afforded by the study period to teach children how to study. 
Improper methods of promotion, due to unnecessarily holding back pupils; not mak- 
ing promotions with sufficient frequency; and to differing standards of promotion.

RECENT PROGRESS IN CITY SCHOOLS. 127 
The latest comprehensive study of the subject of elimination and 
retardation is that embodied in Bulletin, 1911, No. 5, of the Bureau of 
Education, entitled ‘‘Age and grade census of schools and colleges,” 
by Dr. George D. Strayer, of Teachers College, Columbia University. 
Dr. Strayer obtained the number of entering pupils by assuming 
that number to be approximately equal to the number in the largest 
age group in any one grade, found from an age census taken in 1908 
at a time when a practically normal number of pupils were present. 
Proceeding on this assumption he obtained results which show a 
high rate of elimination and retardation. His conclusions for the 
elementary grades are contained in the following quotation: 
In general it may be said that there is relatively little elimination during the first 
four grades. The amount of elimination for these grades will, however, vary greatly 
among the several cities. From the fifth grade on elimination becomes a prominent 
factor, reducing the number of children in a grade, especially the number of repeaters. 
It will be noticed that the median per cent of the largest age group found in the fifth 
grade varies from 95 to 100. This does not mean that 95 per cent of the total number 
of children who enter school during the year equals the number of children who enter 
the fifth grade during this year, but rather that the number of the children entering 
the grade plus those who are repeating it amount to from 95 per cent to 100 per cent 
of the number entering school during the current year. These figures indicate the 
median, and it must be remembered that in half the cities there were less than this 
per cent in the grade, and that in half the cities more than this per cent were found 
in the fifth grade. For the sixth, seventh, and eighth grades it would seem, from 
careful study of a few cities recently made by graduate students in Teachers College, 
Columbia University, that a fair estimate of the number of repeaters in the sixth, 
seventh, and eighth grades would be 12 per cent of the total number in the grade for 
the sixth grade, 10 per cent for the seventh grade, and 8 per cent for the eighth grade. 
If these corrections are applied to the tables given above, it is possible to estimate 
fairly accurately the elimination in these grades. For example, omitting repeaters, 
the percentage of boys in cities of more than 25,000 population in the entering group 
who actually enter a sixth grade would be represented by a median of 73 per cent; 
the seventh grade by a median of 55 per cent; while the eighth grade would show a 
median of approximately 42 per cent. That is, in half of the cities we might expect 
to find less than 73 per cent of the entering group who have actually entered the 
sixth grade during the current year, while in half the cities the percentage would be 
larger. For one-half of the cities 55 per cent or less of the number entering school 
entered the seventh grade during the current year, and for one-half of the cities 55 
per cent or more of the entering group entered the seventh grade during the same year. 
For the eighth grade the point of division falls at 42. 
Such studies as have been indicated here should result in a better 
and more general understanding of the whole question of the school’s 
efficiency or inefficiency, and in the end will make for a proper 
adjustment of the school to meet the demands of the community. 
PROFESSIONAL INVESTIGATIONS. 
Another method of approach to the task of measuring the school’s 
efficiency is to be seen in the recent investigations of individual city 
systems by professional educators or experts. Two such investiga- 
tions have marked the year 1911, one in Baltimore and the other in 
New York City.
-P-A-G-E-148
    
128 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
At a meeting on January 25, 1911, the board of School commission- 
ers of the city of Baltimore adopted a resolution providing ‘‘that the 
committee on rules, curriculum, and textbooks be, and it is hereby, 
directed to employ a commission of three disinterested and competent 
persons to investigate and report upon the system of instruction now 
in force in the public schools of Baltimore city and to spend a sum not 
exceeding $2,000 for this purpose.’ Pursuant to the provisions of 
the resolution the committee secured the services of Dr. Elmer Ells- 
worth Brown, Commissioner of Education of the United States; Dr. 
Ellwood P.Cubberley, professor of the theory and history of education 
in the Leland Stanford Junior University, and Dr. Calvin N. Kendall, 
superintendent of schools, Indianapolis, Ind., as members of the 
commission. The commission and their assistants, Mr. M. B. Hille- 
gas, editor in the Bureau of Education, and Dr. Harlan Updegraff, 
specialist in school administration in the same bureau, spent several 
weeks during the spring and early summer studying conditions in 
Baltimore and comparing data obtained from the study with those 
of other cities of the same class. The results of the study are em- 
bodied in Bulletin, 1911, No. 4, of the United States Bureau of Edu- 
cation. Summarized, the conclusions of the commission are as 
follows: 
(1) That the system of school administration under the charter of 1898 is preferable 
to that of the older charter, under which the members of the larger school board were 
chosen by the city council, there being one member from each ward. 
(2) That expenditures for schools in Baltimore are comparatively low. 
(3) That, while there is ground for adverse criticism at some points in the system, 
in general the schools of Baltimore are ‘‘moving in the right direction.” 
(4) That, generally speaking, the teaching force is efficient, but that the system of 
promotional examinations should be maintained. 
(5) That the corps of supervisors is insufficient in number. 
(6) That the teachers should receive higher salaries. 
(7) That the course of study and time schedule should be revised at some minor 
oints. 
(8) That the general discipline in the schools is good and that coeducation of the 
sexes in the elementary schools, to which some objection had been made in Baltimore, 
is general in the larger cities. 
(9) That many of Baltimore’s schoolhouses are in an unsatisfactory condition. 
A similar study of an individual school system is that of the New 
York City schools, which is in progress at the time of this writing. 
This investigation was begun in June, 1911, under the direction of 
the board of estimate of the city, and is under the supervision of Dr. 
Paul H. Hanus, professor of the history and art of teaching in Har- 
vard University. The university has granted Prof. Hanus a year’s 
leave of absence, and the greater part of the period is to be devoted 
to the investigation. One of the main purposes of the city authori- 
ties in securing the services of an educational expert to study their
-P-A-G-E-149

schools was that the course of study might be examined in all its 
phases and if possible made more practical. Another object in view 
was that the system of administration, including professional control, 
might be subjected to close constructive criticism. This effort in 
New York accentuates the growing conviction that a closer adapta- 
tion of school work to the ordinary needs of life is necessary. 
TESTING THE PRODUCT. 
A third side from which the measurement of the school’s efficiency 
has been approached is represented by the effort to establish a stand- 
_ ard of attainment for the average child in each grade. How much 
arithmetic should the average child in the fourth grade, or any other 
grade, know? How much geography should he know? How much 
spelling? How much arithmetical or spelling ability should he pos- 
sess? It is to these questions that an answer is sought by those who 
would set up standards of attainment by which the product of the 
schools may be measured. ‘ 
One of the earlier efforts in this direction was a study made by 
Dr. Cliff W. Stone,! then fellow in Teachers College, Columbia Uni- 
versity, and now professor in the State Normal School, Farmville, 
Va. Dr. Stone’s purpose was indicated by the two questions to 
which he directed his attention: ‘‘(1) What is the nature of the 
product of the first six years of arithmetic work? (2) What is the 
relation between distinctive procedure in arithmetic work and the 
resulting abilities?” . : 
Through the cooperation of superintendents and principals a series 
of tests was made of the arithmetical abilities of pupils in the 6A 
grade in 26 school systems. These tests were given in both fundamen- 
tal operations and reasoning, and the scores made were tabulated. 
From the figures thus obtained were computed median scores which 
may serve as standards for the measurement of arithmetical abilities 
in 6A grade in any school system. 
In 1910 Prof. Edward L. Thorndike, of Teachers College, Columbia 
University, published a monograph on handwriting, similar in pur-. 
port to that of Dr. Stone on arithmetical abilities. His purpose was 
“‘to describe the means by which a graphometer or scale for hand- 
writing may be made, to present such a scale for the handwriting of 
children in grades 5, 6, 7, and 8, to explain how such a scale is to be 
used, to present a similar scale for adult women’s handwriting, and 
to mention some of the facts and questions of importance to which 
the discovery and use of these scales have led.” Following this pur-

130 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
pose, Dr. Thorndike proceeded to the determination of a standard 
through a number of ratings by different judges of 1,000 samples of 
children’s handwriting. Some 18 different groups, or qualities, were 
conceived and the samples were rated as belonging to one or another 
of these groups, each group being considered slightly better than the 
next lower and slightly inferior to the next higher. By rating sam- 
ples as belonging to one or another of a long series of qualities, Dr. 
Thorndike maintains that a more accurate classification is secured 
than would be with a haphazard rating, and in this way a fairly 
accurate standard can be had. 
A more recent effort, and one designed to secure a wider range of 
data, is that now being made by Mr. S. A. Courtis, head of the depart- ~ 
ment of science and mathematics in the Detroit (Mich.) Home and 
Day School. Like Dr. Stone, Mr. Courtis seeks a standard of meas- 
urement of arithmetical abilities. 
IV. UNIFORMITY IN STATISTICS. 
For years the need of uniformity of methods in the collection of 
statistics and of the standardization of units of measurement has 
been felt. In some of the earlier reports of the National Education 
Association may be found discussions of this need. The latest effort, 
and that which is already well under way toward some measure of 
attainment, has been that of the Bureau of Education working in 
conjunction with the Department of Superintendence of the National 
Education Association, the Bureau of the Census, and the National 
Association of Séhool-Accounting Officers. 
At a meeting of the Department of Superintendence in Indian- 
apolis, in February, 1910, a committee on uniform records and 
reports was appointed and instructed to report at the next meeting 
of the department. This committee was composed of Hon. Payson 
Smith, State superintendent of public instruction of Maine, chair- 
man; Dr. George D. Strayer, of Teachers College, Columbia Uni- 
versity; Mr. William H. Elson, superintendent of city schools, Cleve-- 
land, Ohio; Mr. E. C. Warriner, superintendent of city schools, Sagi- 
naw, Mich.; and Mr. Charles M. Lamprey, director of the model school 
of the Boston Normal School. 
At the suggestion of school-accounting officers in several important 
cities of the country and upon invitation by the Commissioner of 
Education, a number of such accounting officers and other experts 
in fiscal statistics met on May 17, 1910, at the Bureau of Education 
in Washington and organized the National Association of School- 
Accounting Officers. A committee on standardization was ap- 
pointed, and it was decided to cooperate with other agencies for the 
purpose of securing uniformity in school accounting and reporting.
-P-A-G-E-151

RECENT PROGRESS IN CITY SCHOOLS. 131 
Among those present at the organization of this association were 
three representatives of the Bureau of Education, the same number 
from the Bureau of the Census, and two members of the committee 
of the Department of Superintendence. At this mecting impetus 
and direction were given to the movement for uniformity of fiscal 
statistics. 
In May and in December, 1910, and again in January, 1911, con- 
ferences were held by the representatives of the organizations named, 
at which two lines of work were mapped out—one looking toward the 
preparation of a system of record cards to be used by teachers and 
local school authorities in securing the basal data for attendance 
statistics and the like; another, looking toward the preparation of a 
schedule to be used generally in the collection of fiscal statistics. 
The object in preparing the record card was to provide means by 
which the records made by teachers in the schoolroom could be 
expressed in common terms, for, it was pointed out, the very. foun- 
dation on which all attendance statistics must be based is faulty 
unless the records made by teachers are reduced to some common 
standard. The object in preparing the fiscal schedule was twofold: 
(1) To secure uniformity in accounting and in the collection of fiscal 
statistics, in order that such statistics might be made of more value 
for purposes of comparison, and (2) to show items of cost by types 
of schools and by function. 
Tentative forms of both record cards and fiscal schedules were 
agreed upon at the conferences, and the Bureau of Education under- 
took to send them out to school officials for their opinions and sug- 
gestions. As results of this referendum, a large majority of the 
school officials of the country were shown to favor the plan, and 
valuable suggestions were received, which were taken into account 
in the final draft of the forms. 
The forms as agreed upon as a result of the conferences and the 
submission to school men for suggestion were reported by the com- 
mittee to the Department of Superintendence at its meeting in 
Mobile, Ala.,in February, 1911, and were recommended for use. The 
report was adopted by the department. The Bureau of Education 
sent out for approval a complete system of record keeping, compris- 
ing a series of five cards. The committee, however, made report on 
only the first of the series, but will make further report at the next 
meeting of the department. The cumulative record card, which is 
card No 1 of the series, follows.

The wide circulation of this form of record card by the Bureau of 
Education and its adoption by the Department of Superintendence 
have given decided impetus to the use of such a system. During the 
past few months this office has received many inquiries relative to it 
and many requests for samples. When it is in general use a long step 
will have been taken toward the standardization of attendance sta- 
tistics. 
The form of fiscal schedule for use in city school systems as adopted 
by the Department of Superintendence and modified in minor 
details is presented in the chapter devoted to city school systems in 
the second volume of this report. This form has been sent out this 
year for the double purpose of securing the statistics for the fiscal 
year 1910-11 and to lead school authorities to adopt a system of 
accounting in conformity with it. 
Explanatory of the schedule a list of definitions was prepared and 
sent to school officers receiving the schedule. The more important of 
these definitions had received consideration by the participants in the 
conferences mentioned above. While they were intended merely to 
explain the items of the schedule, taken with the schedule itself they 
will serve to show in outline the system of school accounting neces- 
sary to secure uniformity in fiscal statistics in accordance with the 
plan agreed upon by the several agencies working to that end: A 
large number of school officials have already signified their intention 
to modify their systems of accounting to conform with the fiscal

V. THE PHYSICAL WELFARE OF SCHOOL CHILDREN. 
There is probably no subject in all the field of educational thought 
that has engaged more of the attention of school men in recent years 
than the physical welfare of school children. The conviction is 
growing that the school should minister to the physical as well as 
to the mental side of the child and that physical soundness in children 
makes for efficiency in study. That physical defects are potent 
factors in producing irregular attendance, truancy, backwardness, 
and withdrawal from school is now generally understood, and school 
authorities are endeavoring to discover, if not to correct, these 
defects. Efforts in behalf of the health of school children have 
been marked by the introduction of medical inspection, the improve- 
ment of sanitation and school hygiene, and the provision of special 
rooms and schools for the more pronounced types of the physically 
unfortunate. 
MEDICAL INSPECTION. 
_ As early as 1890 San Antonio, Tex., gave some expert medical 
attention to the schools. In that year an epidemic of smallpox 
broke out in the city and necessarily the attention of the board of  
-P-A-G-E-154
  134 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
health was required among school children. The board of ‘“sani- 
tary inspectors” cooperated with the school authorities in stamping 
out the disease, and since that time medical attention to the schools 
has been continued. But it was in Boston, Mass., which began 
medical inspection in 1894, that impetus and direction were given 
to the movement. In his annual report for 1895 Supt. Edwin P. 
Seaver, after giving the number and character of contagious diseases 
discovered and isolated, said: 
The other diseases discovered and for which the necessity for treatment was pointed 
out were are follows: Abscess, 22; catarrh, 244; cellulitis, 12; chorea, 11; colds 
with more or less bronchitis, 224; debility, 63; diseases of the eye, 389; diseases 
of the ear, 35; diseases of the skin and scalp, 186; diseases of the throat and mouth, 
8,489; epilepsy, 5; fracture of collar bone, 1; headache, 171; indigestion, 42; malaria, 
17; nausea; 50; Pott’s disease, 3; swollen glands, 133; ulcers, 16; wounds, 21; mis- 
cellaneous diseases, 411; examined for vaccination, 117. 
From this statement of Supt. Seaver it is evident that the system 
of inspection as begun in Boston did not differ materially in purpose 
and scope from that now in practice in many cities. 
From these early beginnings the movement for the medical inspec- 
tion of school children spread, until in 1911 the department of child 
hygiene of the Russell Sage Foundation, which has made the most 
recent and thorough statistical study of the subject* found that 
of 1,038 cities reporting, 443 had medical inspection. According 
to the same report there were only 23 such cities in 1902. The 
figures for the year 1911 show that most progress has been made 
in the cities of.the North Atlantic and Western Divisions. Of those 
reporting, the percentage of cities having medical inspection was 
as follows: North Atlantic Division, 58 per cent; South Atlantic, 
31 per cent; South Central, 35 per cent; North Central, 29 per 
cent; Western, 57 per cent. Of the 50 cities having a population 
of 100,000 or over in 1910, 48 reported to the Russell Sage Founda- 
tion and 45 of this number had medical inspection. 
In its earlier beginnings the work of inspection was generally under 
the supervision of boards of health, but in more recent years control 
has largely shifted to the educational authorities. On this point 
the Russell Sage Foundation finds that of the 443 cities reporting 
inspection in 1911, 337 report administration by the board of edu- 
cation and 106 by the board of health. 
Medical inspection varies in scope and completeness. In some 
cities little more than the detection and isolation of contagious dis- 
eases is attempted, while in the more elaborate systems regular 
examinations of all children are made at intervals and with a view 
to discovering all forms of ailments. Teeth, eyes, ears, nose, throat, 
lungs, and other parts of the body are examined and diagnoses 
made accordingly. The most general practice is to notify parents

RECENT PROGRESS IN CITY SCHOOLS. 135 
when some ailment is discovered, but in some cities clinics are estab- 
lished for the free treatment of children whose parents are unable to 
provide proper medical attention. School nurses are employed in a 
number of cities to follow up the work of the examining physician by 
visitation of homes and cooperation with both school authorities and 
parents. The following statement, quoted from the annual report 
for 1910 of Supt. Frank B. Dyer, of Cincinnati, Ohio, is a good 
description of a well-organized medical inspection system in a large 
American city: 
In Cincinnati the medical inspection of schools is conducted by the board of health, 
who instituted it on January 1, 1907. The district physicians serve as a corps of 
inspectors. Their duties are to examine and report upon the sanitary condition of 
each school and yard, and to put themselves into communication with the princi- 
pals of their respective schools each day. All pupils whom the principal or teacher 
considers in need of medical attention are referred to these inspectors. The recom- 
mendations of the inspectors are carried out by the principal, who notifies parents 
or guardians and excludes from school when directed. When home treatment is 
not given according to suggestions, the school nurse follows up the case and secures 
home cooperation. A daily notice is sent to each school by the board of health, 
giving information concerning all the children of the city who are excluded for con- 
tagious diseases, and also a list of those who are permitted to return. There are 25 
medical inspectors and 5 nurses. The number of visits made by medical inspectors 
during the year 1909-10 was 4,207; number of pupils examined, 22,932; number 
excluded from school, 1,606. The work of the nurses is found to be of great impor- 
tance, and the present number is inadequate to meet the needs, In a great many 
cases the home pays but little attention to the recommendation of the medical inspector 
unless the nurse follows up the case and secures proper attention. In at least 85 per 
cent of the cases visited by the nurses the cooperation of the home has been secured. 
The system is growing in efficiency year by year, and has now been extended to 
include the parochial schools of the city. 
A phase of inspection that has received especial emphasis in recent 
years is the examination of teeth. Such examinations are usually 
inaugurated by a society of dentists in the city, and in most cities 
where found are still conducted by such societies. The general 
practice is to examine the teeth, chart the results, and send appro- 
priate recommendations to parents. In several cities free dental 
clinics are maintained for the treatment of children of indigent 
parents. tees 
Of 36,403 children examined in Cleveland, Ohio, in March, 1909, 
76.7 per cent were found to have teeth more or less defective. Of 
5,514 similarly examined in Cincinnati in 1910, only 958 were found 
with no defect. If these two cities may be taken as typical, the need 
of dental inspection in schools is palpable. 
SCHOOL HYGIENE, 
Phases of school hygiene that have been of the most interest in the 
past few years have been the movement to abolish the common 
drinking cup, the provision of better equipment for the elimination  
-P-A-G-E-156
    136 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
of dust and dirt, and the installation of more hygienic school fur- 
niture. Here again the report of the Russell Sage Foundation con- 
tains the latest information that approaches completeness. 
To displace the old drinking cup, which was used by all in common 
and which has been considered frequently responsible for the spread 
of disease, have come the individual drinking cup and the bubbling 
fountain from which thirst can be quenched without the use of an 
accessory vessel. The larger percentage of the cities from which 
reports were received supply at least a part of their schools with 
sanitary drinking fountains. The following brief summary shows to 
what extent the common cup has been abolished:

Provisions for the elimination of dust and dirt are to be found in 
the form of moist cloths, dust-absorbing compounds for sweeping, 
and vacuum cleaning appliances. The Russell Sage Foundation 
reports that 643 of the 1,038 cities reporting use moist cloths and 
that 894 use dust-absorbing compounds. In 87 cities vacuum 
cleaners are used. By these means the dust and dirt are entirely 
removed instead of merely stirred up by the old-fashioned broom and. 
feather duster.

RELATION TO HIGHER EDUCATION.’ 
Within the past half dozen years there has been a revival of th 
‘old-time controversy over the relations of secondary schools to uni 
versities and colleges. Pointing out a conflict between the need:   
1 See Chapter II of this report.
-P-A-G-E-159
  
RECENT PROGRESS IN CITY SCHOOLS. 139 
of the community and the requirements of the college, high-school 
men are urging that the college make its entrance standards more 
flexible, while college men, with characteristic conservatism, have 
shown a disposition to proceed in this direction with caution. That 
there is need of an adjustment to the end that secondary schools may 
direct their efforts to other purposes besides preparing their students 
to meet college entrance requirements seems to be generally agreed. 
In this connection the Commissioner of Education, in the introduc- 
tion to his annual report for 1910, said: 
There are two considerations of a general character which are central to this whole 
problem: In the first place, it is not merely a demand of the universities, but a gen- 
uinely popular demand that our high schools should bridge the gap between the gram- 
mar schools and the colleges, offering to all pupils a well-articulated series of educa- 
tional opportunities, from the lowest to the highest. In the second place, where the 
standards of secondary education are uncertain and fluctuating, the colleges must 
fix their own standards of admission or give up the hope of maintaining an honorable 
position in the academic world. 
The historic situation, in which our secondary schools have been held up to a credita- 
ble grade of excellence by the admission requirements of the colleges has, then, been 
amply justified in the past. It is not yet outgrown. But every year it becomes 
more unsatisfactory, in spite of many incidental improvements made in the past 
generation, and we must now look forward to a time when it.can be superseded by 
some different arrangement, which shall be as good for the colleges and better for the 
schools. 
The question centers now more in the content than in the amount 
of requirements. High-school men find it difficult to adjust the 
work of pupils preparing for college to the work of those who do not 
mean to go beyond the secondary school and who desire a more 
practical training. This difficulty can be met in part, they say, by 
making broader the field of college entrance requirements. 
At present there is a decided tendency on the part of college men 
to meet the demands of the secondary schools. . At the meeting of the 
Association of New England Colleges held at Amherst in November, 
1910, the following resolution was adopted: “‘That the association 
recommends that the New England colleges adopt a system of tests 
for admission in which a certificate shall be taken for quantity and 
an examination shall be held in a limited number of substantial sub- 
jects for the quality of school work.” In accordance with this recom- 
mendation, Harvard University, in January of the present year, mod- 
ified its entrance requirements by adopting an alternative plan of 
admission to be tried in conjunction with the older plan. About the 
same time the University of Chicago, after an extended study of the 
problems involved, announced rather radical changes in its require- 
ments. Other large universities that have modified their entrance 
‘standards within recent years are Columbia University, the Univer- 
sity of Wisconsin, and the University of California.

  140 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
EXTENSION OF THE HIGH-SCHOOL CURRICULUM. 
The tendency toward the extension of the high-school curriculum 
has been more marked during the last decade than before.. The 
diversity of social and industrial demands upon the high school has 
made necessary the extension of the range of its activities. To 
meet this necessity have arisen the technical high school, commercial 
courses, courses in household economy, and the like. In recent years 
these types of high-school activity have made rapid headway. 
The most elaborate system of secondary education in the country 
is that worked out and put into effect in the city of Chicago in the 
early part of this year. In that city 11 distinct four-year courses 
and 10 two-year courses are now offered. The four-year courses are 
as follows: 
1, English course. 7. Manual-training course. 
2. General course. 8. Builders course. 
3. Foreign-language course. 9. Household-arts course. 
4. Science course. 10. Arts course. 
5: Normal preparatory course. 11. Architectural course. 
6. Business course. 
The general course is designed to give a general education rather 
than a high degree of specialization. It is the preparatory course 
for colleges and for normal, engineering, and scientific schools. The 
other 10 courses in the four-year group are designed for specializa- 
tion in the lines indicated by the titles. In the English course, for 
instance, the major work is done in English literature and composi- 
tion; in the foreign-language course the major work is done in for- 
eign languages. 
The two-year courses are all vocational in aim. They are in ac- 
counting, stenography, mechanical drawing, design, advanced car- 
pentry, pattern-making, machine-shop work, electricity, household 
arts, and printing. Of these courses the prospectus of courses of 
study for the Chicago high schools says: 
Each two-year course has a major subject, which receives a specially larger propor- 
tion of time and credit. A student pursuing such a course will be required to follow 
it as outlined, in order to be well fitted for the occupation into which the major sub- 
ject leads. Studies taken successfully in the two-year courses will receive credit 
toward graduation from the four-year course. é 
JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOLS. 
A new departure in secondary education in this country is the 
adoption in some cities of a modification of the older ‘six and six 
plan,” in the form of ‘‘junior high schools.” For some years there 
has been advocated the plan of drawing the line of demarcation: 
between elementary and secondary education at the end of the sixth 
year, or grade, and in a number of cities departmental teaching has 
been tried with success in the upper elementary grades, but it was
-P-A-G-E-161
RECENT PROGRESS IN CITY SCHOOLS. 141 
not until 1909 that this tendency took definite form in a separate 
school. On July 6 of that year a resolution was adopted by the 
board of education of Columbus, Ohio, directing Supt. J. A. Shawan 
to organize the new Indianola school as a junior high school, and 
the school was organized accordingly. In the same year Supt. 
Frank F. Bunker, of Berkeley, Cal., introduced the same type of 
school in that city, and from Supt. Bunker’s initial effort the ‘“Berke- 
ley plan” has become widely known. 
The plan involves the combination of the two upper elementary 
grades with the first year of the high school. This would leave in 
the elementary school the first six grades, and the high school proper 
would be composed of the three upper years. The plan contemplates 
the doing of preparatory high-school work under practically high- 
school conditions and is designed to make less abrupt the passage 
from the elementary to the secondary school. As showing more in 
detail the plan submitted by Supt. Bunker, the following quotation 
is taken from his report relative to the proposed school. 
The plan which I have recommended involves a reorganization and regrouping of 
the several grades of our schools. Stated briefly, it is this: To have three groups of 
schools, one group (the high schools proper) comprising the tenth, eleventh, and 
twelfth years only; the second group, which may be called the introductory high- 
school group, comprising theseventh, eighth, and ninth years only; and a third group 
of schools (the elementary schools proper) comprising all children of the first six years, 
To make it more concrete, the plan proposes, when in full operation, that all the 
seventh, eighth, and ninth grade children of the entire department be assembled at 
certain schools which shall be organized for work of this character; that the work of the 
ninth year be no longer done at the high school proper, but at these centers; and that 
the other schools of the department comprise grades no higher than the sixth grade, 
the same to be-feeders to the centers. 
VII. SPECIAL SCHOOLS AND CLASSES FOR EXCEPTIONAL CHILDREN. 
Under the head of ‘‘Studies of elimination and retardation’’ mention 
has already been made of the retarded child. Supt. Maxwell’s 
enumeration of the causes of retardation is not only illuminating, 
but it also abounds with suggestions of remedies. Some of these 
causes clearly indicate that the regular grade work is not adapted 
to the needs of a large percentage of exceptional children, and that 
special, or extra-grade, classes should be organized. If the excep- 
tional child can not be dealt with in the regular classes of the grades, 
some special provision should be made for him in a school or class 
suited to his needs. 
Though provision for the education of the deaf and blind was made 
in this country as early as the beginning of the nineteenth century, 
it was not until the last decade of that century that provision for 
other kinds of atypical children began to attract wide attention. 
The pape administration of compulsory education laws, the greater

number of which were enacted in the seventies and eighties, neces- 
sitated the establishment of truant schools or classes. Cleveland, 
Ohio, led the way with the organization of disciplinary classes in 1878 
and Chicago followed in 1892, and-thereafter many other cities made 
similar provisions. In the late nineties and the earlier years of this 
century the “‘retarded” child began to attract especial attention, 
and special classes to meet his needs made their appearance in the 
American city school system. Pioneer cities in this field were 
Providence, Boston, and Springfield (Mass.), New York City, Phila- 
delphia, and Cleveland. In more recent years special classes have 
been organized for the tuberculous and anemic, the exceptionally 
capable, those having speech defects, and those for whom vocational 
training is better adapted. 
OPEN-AIR SCHOOLS. 
The first city in the country to establish an open-air school for 
tuberculous and anemic children was Providence, R. I., where such 
a school was opened February 1, 1908. Since that time the move- 
ment has spread to all parts of the country. In 1911, 25 cities 
reported open-air schools. Among them are such leaders in educa- 
tional endeavor as Boston, New York, Rochester, Newark, Pittsburgh, 
Chicago, Cincinnati, Oakland, and New Orleans. 
Supt. Maxwell, of New York City, suggests for equipment, venetian 
blinds for the windows, movable and adjustable desks, reclining 
chairs, a scale for weighing and measuring pupils, and clothing 
consisting of robes, caps, and foot warmers. To this might be added 
utensils for the preparation of soup and wholesome lunches. The 
following description, taken from the annual report for 1910 of the 
board of school visitors of Hartford, Conn., will serve as typical of 
the open-air school as at present conducted: 
On the morning of January 3, 1910, the first out-door school in Connecticut was 
opened. It was rainy, cold, and disagreeable, but 23 children registered, and after 
each had been equipped with reefers, sweaters, toques, and sitting-out bags, they 
began actual school work in the tent provided. The change from warm homes and 
schoolrooms to an open tent on such a cold day must have been trying to some of the 
children, but no murmur of discontent, grumbling, or whining was heard that day, 
and the same spirit of cheerfulness prevailed during the entire six months of the 
school. The children were selected from 13 different schools and from 10 different 
nationalities and numbered 47 before the season closed. When children had gained 
sufficiently, or home conditions had materially improved, children were sent home 
at first, but later it seemed best to retain them as long as possible, in order to test not 
only the health-giving scheme of the school but the educational side as well. All 
children centering were selected from groups selected from schools, and examined by 
Dr. Stoll. They were first weighed, and thereafter tested on the scales weekly, and a 
record kept of their weight at each weighing. Some of the records show remarkable 
gains, while others show steady upward progress. The temperature in the tent has 
registered as Iow as 16 degrees while studies were in progress and no one seemed to 
suffer, projection to the feet being assured by heated soapstone in the sitting 
bag, # * >

RECENT PROGRESS IN CITY SCHOOLS. 143 
Most of the pupils who came to us were below grade in their studies. Under our 
ideal conditions (small numbers, perfectly fresh air, nourishing food, rest, and exer- 
cise) they made much progress. One second-grade child who was with us less than 
two months, upon her return to school was put into the fourth grade. We had nine 
grades in our school. One teacher taught: the first five grades; the other took the four 
remaining grades. When possible the classes were united. The backward pupils 
were greatly helped by reciting with several classes. Children who were poor in a 
certain branch were put into two or three elasses of that branch. A child who was 
particularly good in a study was allowed to recite that branch with a higher class. 
In every way the children were encouraged and nct held back. 
Program: Breakfast, 8.45-9.15; recitations, 9.15-11.30; gymnastics and play, 11.30- 
11.45; washing of hands and dinner, 11.45-12.30; cleaning of teeth and sleep, 12.30- 
1.45; recitations, 1.45-3.45; supper, 3.45-4. 
THE EXCEPTIONALLY CAPABLE CHILD. 
Not so much is done for the exceptionally capable child as for the 
retarded. It is generally taken for granted that the talented child 
can take care of himself, but from an economic point of view there is 
more loss in the arrested progress of a pupil of this class than there 
is in that of the dullard. If a bright boy is capable of doing the work 
of the eight grades in seven years he should be permitted to do it 
in that time. In 1911, 54 cities reported some provision for the 
exceptionally capable child. He is receiving recognition through 
either the organization of special classes or the adoption of more 
flexible systems of promotion. Baltimore, Cincinnati, Indianapolis, 
Worcester, and Salt Lake City now provide special classes for those 
above the normal in mental ability. 
SPEECH DEFECTS. 
Special classes for stammerers and others having speech defects 
are conducted in New York, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Seattle. Upon 
investigation in 1910 Supt. Ella Flagg Young, of Chicago, found 
that there were 1,744 children in the schools of that city who had 
speech defeets of one kind or another. Accordingly 10 special 
teachers were employed to devote their efforts to the correction of 
these defeets. The children affected, however, were not gathered 
into one building or into classes, but a plan was adopted of assigning 
to each teacher a cireuit and having her travel from school to school 
during the day. In the other cities named special classes were 
formed.

As showing the present status of the movement for the provision 
of special schools and classes for-exceptional children, the following

Education.

VII. INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION. 
By industrial education is meant here the new direction which has 
been given during the past decade to hand training. This new 
direction comprehends the training in school of youth for specific 
vocations in the industries. It differs from ordinary manual training 
in that it is vocational and specific, while manual training is cultuyal 
and general in aim. In its broader application it is sometimes used 
to include every form of training for the industries, but in recent 
years the tendency has been to narrow the meaning to make it 
practically synonymous with trade training. 
While it is not claimed that industrial education is distinctly a 
city school movement, it is true that the major part of what has been 
accomplished in this country in training for the industries has been 
in the cities. It is in the cities that industrial needs are greatest. 
From a list of 142 industrial schools prepared in the Bureau of Educa- 
tion in 1910, 121, or 85 per cent, were found to be in cities of 25,000 
population and over. This list, however, did not include industrial 
schools for Indians and for the colored race, many of which are 
located in rural communities. But of the technical high schools 
which offer instruction more or less industrial in aim, practically all 
are in the larger cities. 
Two agencies that have given decided impetus and direction to the 
new movement are the Massachusetts Commission on Industrial 
Education and the National Society for the Promotion of Industrial 
Education. 
Though the new movement had an earlier origin it did not begin 
to take definite form in this country until about 1905. It was in 
Massachusetts that the first definite step was taken. Under authority 
of a resolve of the legislature of that State, approved May 24, 1905, 
the governor appointed a ‘‘commission on industrial education”’ to 
investigate the subject in the State of Massachusetts and ‘‘as to 
similar educational work done by other States, by the United States 
Government, and by foreign Governments.” After several months 
of study, the commission made its report with recommendations, 
one of which was that a second commission be appointed to extend 
the investigation of industrial training and of local needs and to 
advise and aid in the introduction of independent industrial schools. 
This recommendation was embodied in’ the law of 1906 which 
created such a commission and defined its powers and duties. Under 
the provisions of this law, cities’ and towns were empowered to 
establish independent industrial schools and to receive State aid 
upon approval of the commission. Prior to October 1, 1911, 15 
schools had been approved by the commission and by the State board 
of education to which its functions were transferred. On that date 
 
-P-A-G-E-167
  
RECENT PROGRESS IN CITY SCHOOLS. 147 
8 additional schools were in process of organization in anticipation of 
similar approval. 
The appointment of the Massachusetts commission and the publi- 
cation of its reports gave great momentum to the movement for 
industrial education, but they have not stood alone in the exertion 
of such influence. The organization of the National Society for the 
Promotion of Industrial Education in New York City in November, 
1906, marked the beginning of a potent factor in both the develop- 
ment and the direction of industrial training. Its objects as stated ~ 
by its founders are: 
To bring to public attention the importance of industrial education as a factor in 
the industrial development of the United States; to provide opportunities for the 
study and discussion of the various phases of the problems; to make available the 
results of experience in the field of industrial education both in this country and 
abroad, and to promote the establishment of institutions for industrial training. 
The society holds annual meetings at which all phases of the subject 
are discussed, and publishes a bulletin containing information designed 
to promote the objects of the organization. 
In addition to this society a number of other organizations! of 
national scope have interested themselves in industrial education. 
Two of the most important of these are the National Association of 
-Manufacturers and the American Federation of Labor. By the 
adoption of the report of its committee on industrial education made 
in May, 1910, the Association of Manufacturers committed itself to 
the policy of taking ‘‘boys of 14 years of age and giving them four 
years of training corresponding to the high-school period—half 
skilled work and half suitable schooling.” 
At the thirteenth annual convention of the Federation of Labor 
held in St. Louis in November, 1910, the report of the special com- 
mittee appointed to review the report of the committee on indus- 
trial education recommended “that the special committee appointed 
by authority of the Denver [1908] convention be continued, and that 
that committee be urged and authorized to prosecute their investi- 
gation, and to lend every assistance to the accomplishment of the 
extension and completion of comprehensive industrial education in 
every field of activity.” The convention concurred in the report by 
unanimous vote. 
CLASSIFICATION OF INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 
As regards character and amount of instruction given, there may 
be said to be in the United States three types of industrial training: 
(1) Complete trade training, in which the effort is to develop skilled 
workers capable of doing journeyman’s work; (2) intermediate, or 
preapprentice, trade training, through which it is sought to shorten 
  
1 For a list of such organizations see Annual Report of the Commissioner of Education, 1910,'p. 224.   
 
-P-A-G-E-168
  148 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
the period of apprenticeship or to give some industrial skill and intel- 
ligence preparatory to apprenticeship; (3) supplementary instruction 
for those aiready engaged. in industrial pursuits. 
Classified according to the source of support, there are four kinds 
of industrial schools: (1) Those depending on tuition fees and usually 
operated for profit, (2) those supported by endowment. (3) those 
operated by business corporations for the instruction of their em- 
ployees, and (4) those supported by public funds. A careful examina- 
tion of the courses offered reveals the fact that in the main those 
schools which offer complete trade training are supported either by 
tuition or by endowment, and that with few exceptions public indus- 
trial schools as yet offer only supplementary and preapprentice 
instruction. 
Another classification may be made of industrial schools, the line 
of demarcation being drawn between schools which devote the whole 
time to instruction and those in which part time is devoted to instruc- 
tion and the remainder to work in a shop or factory and under shop 
or factory conditions. Those in which all the time is spent in school 
are the more numerous. Schools in which part of the time is spent 
at work under factory conditions constitute a new development in 
industrial training in this country. Fitchburg, Mass., was the first 
city in the country to establish such a school as a part of the public-. 
school system. In 1908 a modification of the ‘‘cooperative plan,” 
introduced two years previously in the engineering department of the 
University of Cincinnati, was introduced in the Fitchburg High School. 
Boys were employed alternate weeks in various industries of the city 
and were paid stipulated wages. The other half of the time was 
devoted to study in school. The school is now in the fourth year of 
its history and the plan has been pronounced a success. 
Fitchburg’s lead has been followed by several cities, though usually 
the term “Continuation school” is applied, in analogy to the German 
term Fortbildungsschule. Continuation schools are now conducted 
in Boston, New York, Providence, Chicago, and Cincinnati, and 
beginnings have been made in some other cities. 
LEGISLATION RELATING TO INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION, 
The National Society for the Promotion of Industrial Education 
reports! that, of the 46 States, 29 have enacted laws relating to 
industrial training. These States are Alabama, Arkansas, Connecti- 
cut, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Towa, Kansas, Kentucky, 
Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, 
Mississippi, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, 
Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, Wisconsin, and

Wyoming. The diverse terminology in the enactments of the several 
States, however, renders a close classification well-nigh impossible 
and necessitated the inclusion in the list of some laws which do not 
relate strictly to industrial education. 
Laws were enacted by State legislatures meeting in 1911 as follows: 
Alabama.—Appropriating $50,000 for the establishment of an 
industrial school at Ragland, and $5,000 for its maintenance. 
Colorado.—(1) Providing for the establishment of a school of agri- 
culture and mechanic arts at the Fort Lewis School and appropriating 
$75,000 therefor. (2) Establishing the Colorado State Trade School 
at Aspen. 
Indiana.—Authorizing any city having a population of over 200,000 
to establish and maintain a trade school. 
Maine.—Providing for the introduction of industrial courses in free 
high schools and academies and in State normal schools for the 
training of teachers, and empowering cities and towns to establish 
“general industrial schools.” 
Massachusetts—(1) Making appropriations for independent indus- 
trial schools. (2) Further providing for the administration of 
vocational schools receiving State aid. 
Michigan.—Authorizing any school district to establish vocational 
schools. 
Minnesota.—Providing for the teaching of certain industrial sub- 
jects in high and graded schools. 
Pennsylwania.—Appropriating $10,000 for the maintenance for two 
years of the Avery College Trade School at Southside, Pittsburgh. 
Wisconsin.—Creating a State board of industrial education and 
providing for the establishment of vocational schools and of a Seog 
to train teachers of industrial subjects. 
PRESENT STATUS OF INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION. 
The present status of industrial education in the United States is 
shown to some degree in Chapter III of the Annual Report for 1910. 
In that chapter an attempt was made to list and classify industrial 
schools. The classification was necessarily tentative, but it serves 
to show to what extent the movement has spread. Not all the 
schools in the list were recently established, but many of them are 
of recent origin and new direction has been given to many of those 
already in existence. The list does not include a few schools known 
to exist but from which no reports could be obtained. 
In Group A of that list the more complete classification was 
attempted. Schools were classified as giving (1) complete trade 
training, (2) preapprentice instruction, or (3) supplementary instruc- 
tion to those already engaged in industrial pursuits. In all, 142 
schools were included in this group. 
 
-P-A-G-E-170
    150 : EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
Group B included schools for the colored race. Most of these 
schools are primarily academic in aim and the industrial instruction 
given is usually supplementary to academic work. For this reason 
these schools were grouped separately, as giving industrial training 
that is difficult to classify. This group contained 53 institutions, 
but it is known that a number of others give industrial training in 
some form. 
Group C was made up largely of nonreservation boarding schools 
for Indians. Of these schools 14 were reported by the Office of Indian 
Affairs to be giving systematic trade training in some trades, and 8 
some form of less specific trade training. 
To the list a fourth group was added which included technical high 
schools. Generally this type of school is not giving trade training, 
but they are offering much instruction supplementary to the trades 
and much that prepares for technical or semitechnical pursuits in the 
industries. This group was likewise difficult to classify, but reports 
were received from 28 schools which were thought to belong in the 
list. 
VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE. 
For some time there have been those who have thought that the 
public school should give more attention to directing the choice of its 
pupils’ future vocations. The higher institutions of learning not only 
prepare for vocations but follow their graduates into life with advice 
and assistance. In contrast with this the public school has too often 
sent out its pupils without even so much as a heartily expressed good 
wish. There is, however, a growing disposition on the part of public- 
school men to make the school more helpful in this respect. In New 
York,. Boston, Providence, Buffalo, Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, 
and some other cities steps have been taken to that end. A national 
conference on vocational guidance was held in Boston on November 
15 and 16, 1910. From a small beginning vocational guidance has 
spread in New York City until every day and evening high school has 
one or more teachers who are charged with the duty of helping stu- 
dents choose vocations and secure employment. 
In May, 1909, the school committee of Boston requested the cooper- 
ation of the vocation bureau and provided for the appointment of a 
“committee on vocational direction” to be composed of six members 
of the teaching staff. The committee was appointed by the superin- 
tendent in the following month and immediately entered upon the 
performance of its duties. Of the work of this committee Supt. 
Stratton D. Brooks, in his annual report for 1910, said: 
The committee on vocational direction has arranged for cooperation among various 
organizations interested in the work of vocational direction, conducted meetings of 
principals and teachers, and taken such other action as they deemed necessary.
-P-A-G-E-171
  
RECENT PROGRESS IN CITY SCHOOLS. 151 
Most important of the results accomplished by the committee on vocational advice 
is the appointment in each high school and elementary school of one or more voca- 
tional counselors. These counselors have been selected by the principals with refer- 
ence to their interest in the work of vocational direction, their skill in determining the 
abilities and possibilities of the children, and their willingness to devote extra time 
to acquiring information and perfecting themselves for the successful performance of 
their important duties. Meetings of these counselors have been held for the purpose 
of discussing the problems of vocational direction and considering how best to minimize 
its dangers and increase its beneficial results. Arrangements have been made whereby 
the vocation bureau will conduct a course of instruction for vocational counselors 
wherein they may be even more efficiently prepared for the work of directing pupils 
wisely. . 
IX. THE WIDER USE OF THE SCHOOL PLANT. 
The average American school building is open not more than 6 
hours a day for 5 days a week and 36 weeks in a year—about 1,080 
hours. If Sundays be excluded, there are in all approximately 3,000 
hours in a year during which buildings might be used. This indi- 
cates a time waste of about 1,920 hours, or 64 per cent. With the 
possible exception of the church, no American institution uses its 
plant so little. Certainly public buildings in general are used more 
than schoolhouses, notwithstanding the fact that more money is 
-invested in the latter. But this is not the only consideration. There 
is a wide and growing social need which the school building may 
serve. Many places of amusement frequented by young people in 
large cities are unwholesome in their influence and the schoolhouse 
should provide the needed healthier social and moral environment. 
In recent years the movement for the wider use of the school plant 
has taken form particularly in vacation schools, public evening 
lectures, and social and recreation centers. 
VACATION SCHOOLS. 
Although the first vacation school organized as a part of a city 
school system was opened as early as 1885, in Newark, N. J., it was 
not until the late nineties that the movement became general and not 
until the first decade of this century that school boards generally 
began to take control of such schools. At first they were conducted 
wholly or in part by philanthropic organizations. 
There are two types of the vacation school; or, otherwise expressed, 
there are two lines of work which vacation schools pursue. In the 
first type the aim is social, being merely to offer the children an 
opportunity to get out of the hot and crowded streets and into more 
wholesome surroundings in which they may play, sing, and do ele- 
mentary handwork and the like under competent direction. Usually 
some instruction is offered in nature study, first aid to the injured, 
and similar subjects. Vacation schools of this sort are the more 
 
-P-A-G-E-172
  
  152 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
numerous and better known. The second type is academic in aim. 
In several cities special classes are organized in vacation time for the 
purpose of enabling pupils failing in some of their studies of the 
previous year to make up work, and thus escape repeating a whole 
year’s work. In some cases especially capable pupils are permitted 
to study in vacation time in order to advance a grade or to save part 
of a year. 
Two notable examples cf the latter type of vacation school are 
those found in the work undertaken in Cleveland and St. Louis this 
year. Since the plans in these two cities contemplate the most thor- 
oughly organized system of academic work in vacation time in the 
country at present, they are presented at length. Supt. W. H. 
Elson’s recommendations as adopted by the Cleveland Board of 
Education at its meeting on May 22, 1911, follow:* 
First. That the summer school shall begin Monday, June 5, and continue 12 weeks. 
The attendance in this school shall not be compulsory, but be entirely at the option 
of the parents, and that in cases of doubtful physical ability attendance shall be on the 
approval of the medical inspector. This does not release the child from attendance 
at the regular school terms beginning in September and ending in May. 
Second. That in elementary schools it should offer an opportunity for retarded chil- 
dren in the grades from the fourth to the eighth, inclusive, who are retarded one year, 
and below the fourth grade children who are retarded two years or more. : 
Third. That the hours be from 8 a. m. to 2 p. m., with recess in the morning and 
one hour for noon, and salaries of teachers should conform to those of the regular school 
year. 
Fourth. All elementary school buildings should be open for summer classes except 
where the director of schools finds it impossible on account of repairs or changes to use 
the building, in which case the children should be transferred to another school. 
Fifth. One teacher in each building should be assigned as assistant principal, who 
shall make reports and direct in matters of detail. 
Sixth. The make-up of classes shou!d conform to the regulations governing the same 
in the regular school year, and in cases where there are not sufficient pupils to consti- 
tute a school children should be transferred to the nearest building having their grade 
and division. 
Seventh.. Obviously, in view of the bearing of the summer school upon the regular 
school, principals will desire to organize the classes in their respective buildings. In 
view of the early closing this year this will be possible and will require their attend- 
ance on the first day of the summer school. 
Eighth. That an academic high school for regular work be opened in the Central 
High building, to which pupils from any high-school district in the city may be admit- 
ted, the hours and salaries of teachers to conform to those of the regular school year, 
one teacher being assigned as assistant principal, who shall direct the details of the 
school and make reports. 
Ninth. That regular work be conducted in the Technical High School and the High 
School of Commerce, as heretofore. 
The following recommendations, submitted by Supt. Ben Blewett, 
of St. Louis, were adopted by the board of education of that city on 
June 13, 1911:?

RECENT PROGRESS IN CITY SCHOOLS.: 153 
1. That the board establish a vacation review school for pupils wishing to make 
up deficiencies in not more than two studies and not extending over more than two 
quarters’ work, and for pupils capable of doing work for an advanced class. 
2. That pupils be admitted to this school from the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth 
grades and from any high-school term. 
3. That admission be possible only on the certificate of the principal of the school 
from which the pupil comes that the pupil can undertake the review in subjects 
named with a reasonable expectation of success. 
4. That the superintendent of instruction be authorized to admit to the school 
pupils whom the principals shall certify as capable of undertaking advanced work, 
provided these can be accommodated after those entered to do review work. 
5. That the principal of the vacation review school shall, at the close of the term, 
certify to the work that has been tested and satisfactorily completed by each pupil 
and-that this certificate shall be given full credit in placing the pupil on his return 
to his school at the beginning of the regular term. 
6. That the term of this school be for seven weeks and that the sessions be on six 
days of the week, during the morning, hours to be fixed by the superintendent of 
instruction. 
7. That the following be approved as the schedule of per diem salaries: Principal, 
$6; teacher of high-school subjects, $4; teacher of grade subjects, $3. 
8. That the school be held in the Central High School building. 
Supt. Blewett reported to the St. Louis Board of Education on 
September 12, 1911, as follows: 1 
Attendance.—The board at the June meeting authorized the organization of classes 
for the benefit of pupils whose principals certified that they could undertake specified 
review or advanced work during a summer term with reasonable expectation of success 
init. The number of pupils applying for admission to these classes greatly exceeded 
the first expectations. There were registered in grade studies 1,958 pupils; in -high- 
school studies, 740 pupils. There were in attendance in the grades and high school, 
respectively, 1,592 and 676 pupils. 
The expense for salaries was $9,828, and for textbooks and stationery $799.05, 
a total of $10,627.05. This does not include any expense for textbooks borrowed from 
the stock of the several schools. The actual cost per pupil was approximately $4.75. 
Organization.—The number of pupils made it advisable to place the high-school 
work and the grade work in separate buildings. They were located, respectively, in 
the Soldan and Central High School buildings. 
Results.—The character of the attendance, the spirit of the pupils, and the success 
in the work undertaken by them seem to have met the highest expectations of the 
board and its officers. No recent extension of the work provided for so large a need, 
and it seems probable that there will be a demand for additional schools for the con- 
venience of pupils in the grades wishing to do this work in the summer. * * * 
At the beginning of the last week of the term the membership was 1,595 (719 boys 
and 876 girls). Of this number, 606 boys and 778 girls (1,384 total) received certifi- 
cates. One thousand one hundred and ninety-one were satisfactory in two subjects, 
149 passed in one subject and failed in one, and 44 who were taking only one subject 
received certificates for credit. Thirty-five did not appear for examination and 176 
failed on examination to get any credit. 
Three hundred and twenty-one brought certificates requesting two quarters’ work 
in two subjects. At the middle of the-term 47 of these were requested to abandon 
the attempt to do two quarters’ work. Of the 274 who continued, 216 completed 
two quarters’ work in two subjects.

  PUBLIC EVENING LECTURES. 
One of the most noteworthy examples of the extension of the 
use of the school building is its use for public evening lectures. 
Such lectures are now to be found in a large number of cities. 
As might be expected the lecture movement has attained different 
degrees of perfection in different cities. From the elaborate system 
in New York, where the department of education provides lectures 
in 166 centers and under the supervision of a specialist, the scale 
descends to the smaller city in which the use of one or two buildings 
is allowed and lecturers are paid by means of a small admission fee 
or by contribution from a school improvement association or some 
source other than the school board. 
The most extensive system of free public lectures in the United 
States is that in the City of New York. The following summary 
shows the number and character of lectures given in 1909-10:

RECENT PROGRESS IN CITY SCHOOLS. 155 
In addition to these courses of lectures, single lectures were given 
in 971 subjects. In 1910, lectures were given to an aggregate 
attendance of 959,982 people. 
Cleveland is an example of the city that makes its lectures popular 
in nature. After a period of entertainment, including music, recita- 
tions, and the like, a lecture is delivered on some subject of general 
interest. Civics, travel, hygiene, social questions, and similar 
subjects are discussed in popular style. Lecturers are drawn from 
almost all walks of life. A physician discusses some phase of pre- 
ventive medical practice, a college professor points out some social 
fault and suggests means of correction, a minister makes an appeal 
for the boys of the city, a business man outlines the qualifications 
necessary to efficiency in commercial life, and so on. But partisan 
politics and sectarianism are barred. The lectures given in Cleve- 
land have met with hearty public-approval and have been of great 
benefit to the people. 
Milwaukee introduced public evening lectures in 1902, and since 
that time has developed a comprehensive system of courses, which 
are proving a strong force for social betterment and for broadening 
the culture of the people. Many of the lectures are illustrated and 
cover such subjects as history, natural science, art, literature, travel, 
sociology, economics, and industrial and municipal problems. In 
1909 such lectures were given in 25 buildings. Mr. W. L. Pieplow, 
president of the board of school directors, reports the lectures grow- 
ing in popularity. 
Birmingham, Ala., is one of the cities in which there is a lecture 
system not supported from school funds and not yet free to all the 
people. In that city, through the initiative of Supt. J. H. Phillips, 
a “lyceum course” has been organized. The use of the high-school 
auditorium is given free and the board of education furnishes heat, 
light, and janitor service. A nominal fee is charged for the pay- 
ment of lecturers, but the lectures are largely patronized neverthe- 
less. Lectures on literature, art, travel, history, and the like, and 
entertainments of various sorts find place on the programs. 
Other important cities which have lecture systems are Los Angeles, 
San Francisco, Chicago, Indianapolis, Louisville, New Orleans, 
Worcester, Minneapolis, St. Paul, St. Louis, Jersey City, Newark, 
Rochester, Cincinnati, Columbus, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Mem- 
phis, and Richmond. 
SOCIAL AND RECREATION CENTERS. 
The latest development in the extension of the use of the school 
plant is its use as a social and recreation center. Though New 
York City opened an evening recreation center as early as 1899, it 
was devoted chiefly to athletics, and so continued until the move-
-P-A-G-E-176
  156 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
ment assumed a wider range several years later. It was in Roches- 
ter, N. Y., however, that social and recreation centers were first 
extensively organized, and it is to that city that many of those 
interested in such enterprises look for guidance. 
Libraries and reading rooms, social and civic clubs, Hickey 
societies, organizations for the study of music and art, concerts and 
dramatics, gymnasiums, and recreation rooms, all come within the 
scope of this type of school extension. ‘The Yearbook of the Play- 
ground Association of America reports that 31 cities maintained 
recreation centers during the winter of 1910-11. The following 
statements show more in detail the nature of the activities fostered 
in some cf the more important cities: + 
Rochester —In the winter of 1906-7 a campaign was begun for the use of the school 
building for social and civic clubs, and as a result the ‘‘school extension committee,”* 
representing 11 citizens’ organizations, was formed. On petition the board of esti- 
mate and the common council provided the necessary funds and three centers were 
opened. The board of education as custodian of school properties assumed the 
administration. Supervision was provided for all activities, especially those for 
boys and girls, Mr. Edward J. Ward being the chief supervisor in charge. During 
the year 1909-10, 16 buildings were opened, though only the original 3 centers were 
equipped for general social-center work. In this city almost every kind of whole- 
some amusement, recreation, and entertainment is offered. There are civic clubs 
for both men and women, debating societies, literary clubs, social organizations, 
musical entertainments, art clubs, athletic leagues, reading rooms, quiet game rooms, 
and gymnasiums. In concluding his report in 1910, Mr. Ward said: “The aim of the 
school extension movement during the past three years has been to so widen the 
use of the school plant that this institution may serve in the complex life of the city 
as'the little simple schoolhouse served in the primitive life of the rural community, 
not only as an educational center for the children, but also as thes common local point 
of the neighborhood life.” 
New York.—In his annual report for the year ending July 31, 1910, Supt. William H. 
Maxwell says: “Evening recreation centers were maintained from October until 
June in 36 school buildings. The aggregate attendance was 2,165,457, an increase of 
18,196 over the preceding year. The average evening attendance was 12,985, an 
increase of 1,517 over the preceding year. The chief activities were quiet games, 
reading (books being furnished by the public libraries), gymnastics, athletic sports, 
folk dancing, literary and social clubs, and study rooms for children who have no 
convenient place to study their lessons at home.’’ In 1910-11, 38 centers have been 
conducted. Of this number 27 are open every night in the week except Sunday 
nights; others are opened on specified evenings. Sessions usually last from 7.30 to 
10 p.m. There are 26 centers for men and boys and 12 for women and girls. Ath- 
letic, civic, literary, philanthropic, and social clubs are maintained. In 1910 Dis- 
trict Supt. Edward W. Stitt, to whom was assigned the supervision of vacation schools, 
playgrounds, and recreation centers, reported 774 such clubs in existence. The 
public library supplies books to each center for its reading room and changes are 
frequently made. In this way the social and recreation center becomes a circulating 
library base. Free gymnasium privileges are offered, and such games as basket ball, 
handball, and indoor baseball are played by the boys. The girls dance folk and 
esthetic dances. Regular dancing classes are organized in centers for girls, and 
once a week approved members of a neighboring center for young men are admitted.

-P-A-G-E-177
RECENT PROGRESS IN CITY SCHOOLS. 157 
A game room is provided, usually near the entrance, where such quiet games as 
checkers and dominos can be played. Athletic contests among the various play and 
recreation centers are encouraged. 
Philadelphia.—The first social center was opened January 22, 1907, in the Agnew 
School, through the initiative of the principal. The board of education granted the 
use of the building for two nights in a week aud furnished heat, light, and janitor 
service. Financiai aid was given by the Public Education Association and by the 
Civic Club. The teachers at first were volunteers, but later some paid workers were 
employed. During the year 1909-10 there were eight centers in operation, seven 
others having been organized on similar lines to those of the Agnew School. Prima- 
rily the object of these centers is to draw young people into wholesome surroundings 
in the evenings. The work is not identical in all buildings, but the following will 
indicate in general the character of the activities: Classes in manual training, sewing, 
music, and gymnastics; folk dancing; social and musical entertainments; lectures on 
civics, hygiene, travel, etc.; civic clubs; reading rooms, and rooms for quiet games. 
Statistics for 1909-10: Buildings in use, 8; classes organized, 53; sessions, 164; average 
attendance, adults, 258; minors 15 to 21 years old, 489; minors under 15 years old, 788. 
Chicago.—Library facilities, gymnastics, games, sewing, lectures, music, and social 
dancing are offered to those who attend. The aim is to provide, as far as possible, 
healthy social and moral environment for the young. Private philanthropy and the 
cooperation of benevolent organizations contribute to the support of the work. In 
1910 the board of education appropriated $10,000 for social centers. In her annual 
report for 1910, Supt. Ella Flagg Young says: ‘‘The distinctive gain was not so much 
in what was learned as in the social and moral conditions that were made attractive, 
and that tended to draw the young people from the more dangerous class of amuse- 
ments which they were likely to frequent.” 
Cleveland.—The social center is in charge of a special committee of the board of 
education. Children below the seventh grade are not admitted unless accompanied 
by their parents. The activities include lectures on civics, travel, hygiene, and 
other subjects suitable to the community. Music and a “‘social hour” usually follow 
the lecture. In its announcement for the season of 1910-11, the committee on lectures 
and social-center development says: ‘The program has this year, as in the past, the 
elements of recreation and entertainment. Every lecture is supplemented by music 
and fine pictures, while every concert is designed to delight the popular audience.” 
X. PLAYGROUNDS. 
In only five cities were public playgrounds with supervised play 
maintained prior to the year 1900, namely, Boston, Philadelphia, 
Pittsburgh, New York City, and St. Paul.t’ Boston appears to have 
been the first city to provide supervised play, it having been estab- 
lished in that city as early as 1887, but it was in Philadelphia in 
1895 that the administration of public playgrounds was first under- 
taken by the school authorities of a large city. From these beginnings 
the movement has grown until, in 1910, 184 cities maintained play- 
grounds. 
The Playground Association of America, organized in Washing- 
ton, D. C., April 13, 1906, has given great impetus to the establish- 
ment of public play centers. Since its organization 98 cities have 
established public playgrounds—more than one-half the total num- 
ber reporting such activities in 1910.   
  
1'The Playground,  : 24-33, April, 1911.   
 
-P-A-G-E-178
  
158 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
Playgrounds are of two types, (1) those on land contiguous to 
school buildings and (2) those located in small parks or lots apart 
from school buildings and having no connection with them. The 
playground propaganda contemplates the development of both 
types. Many schoolhouses in the cities are constructed on lots 
only large enough for the buildings alone, and have little or no space 
around them for play; but the present tendency is toward larger 
grounds. Some authorities urge at least as much as 30 square feet 
of space for each child. 
The playground not contiguous to a school building is usually 
located on land acquired for that purpose or in a park. In the 
better organized systems, competent persons for instruction and 
supervision are employed. 
The nature of the play varies, as might be expected. In New 
York City the boys play basket ball, indoor baseball, handball, 
dodge ball, and the like; while the girls play milder games and exer- 
cise in various forms of systematic drills and folk dances; swings, 
seesaws, and similar apparatus are installed; kindergartens are 
organized in connection with the playgrounds, and departments for 
mothers and their babies are provided; story-telling has recently 
been introduced. 
In Cincinnati, the supervisor conducted in 1909-10 a class for the 
training of teachers for playground work; the grounds are open in 
the afternoons in the spring and fall from 3 to 5.30 p. m., and during 
vacation from 8.30 a. m. to 7.30 p. m. on six days in the week; not 
all the time is devoted to play; for the boys are given instruction in 
manual work in wood, etc., and the girls in sewing, crocheting, box- 
work, clay modeling, and raphia. . 
In Detroit, both boys and girls are divided into three classes, 
class A including all over 85 pounds in weight, class B including all 
between 70 and 85 pounds, and class C all under 70 pounds; system- 
atic exercise is given each class; contests are held from time to time 
between two different centers; in addition to the play, work in sewing, 
basketry, and the like is given. 
In Washington, Congress appropriates funds for grading grounds 
and buying equipment, and supervision is provided by private sub- 
scription; centers are equipped with swings, seesaws, sand boxes, and 
the like; various kinds of organized games are played; some instruc- 
tion in handwork is given; a new feature is the coordination of the 
playground with the school garden. 
As showing the recent development and present status of play- 
ground work, the following is quoted from the Yearbook of the 
Playground Association of America: 
Reports have been received from only 184 of the cities maintaining playgrounds. 
These 184 cities during the year ending November 1, 1910, maintained 1,244 play- 
grounds, employed 3,345 men and women exclusive of caretakers, and expended
-P-A-G-E-179
RECENT PROGRESS IN CITY SCHOOLS. 159 
$3,025,779.23. The reports failed to indicate whether 1,044 of the persons employed 
were men or women. Where the sex of the worker was given, 810 were men and. 
1,491 women. Thirty-two cities employed 643 workers throughout the year. 
In 17 cities playgrounds were maintained by playground commissions, in 15 cities 
by school boards, in 28 cities by park boards, in 27 cities by playground associations, 
in 5 cities by private individuals, in 88 cities by other agencies or by several agencies 
combined. 
In 62 cities the playgrounds were supported by municipal funds, in 51 cities by 
private funds, in 59 cities by both municipal and private funds, in 1 city by municipal 
and county funds. In 11 cities the sources of support were not given. 
In 68 cities 219 playgrounds were open throughout the year. There were 874 play- 
grounds open only during July and August. In 3 cities some of the playgrounds were 
open nine months. In 5 cities some of the playgrounds were open April 1 to Decem- 
ber 1, in 5 from April 1 to November 1, in 4 from May 1 to November 1, in 6 from 
May 1 to October 1, in 2 from June 1 to December 1, and in 4 from June 1 to Novem- 
ber 1. There were 214 playgrounds in 60 cities open in evenings. 
Thirty-one cities reported that their schoolhouses were used as recreation centers; 
27 of these cities reported 201 such centers. 
The number of cities reporting special playground activities were as follows: 
Dramatics, 26; folk-dancing, 94; gardening, 43; industrial work, 76; libraries, 52; self- 
government, 40; singing, 72; story telling, 114; swimming, 69; wading, 51. 
According to the reports received, supervised playgrounds were first established in 
128 cities as follows: In 1 city in 1887, 1 in 1895, 1 in 1896, 1 in 1898, 1 in 1899, 7 in 
1900, 5 in 1901, 2 in 1902, 2 in 1903, 5 in 1904, 4 in 1905, 9 in 1906, 6 in 1907, 13 in 
1908, 35 in 1909, and 35 in 1910. >

CHAPTER V. 
LIBRARY EXTENSION IN THE UNITED STATES. 
By Joun D. Wotcorr, 
Acting Librarian, Bureau of Education. 
INTRODUCTION. 
The modern conception of the duties of the public library extends 
them to the entire community, requiring the library to find a reader 
for every book on its shelves and provide a book for every reader, 
and in all cases to bring book and reader together. Not merely the 
residents of cities and towns where libraries are located, but also the 
inhabitants of the rural districts, however remote, are entitled to this 
service. The public library is made an essential factor in the educa- 
tional system, both because of its independent service to all classes 
of people throughout life, and also because of its cooperation with the 
public schools, which constantly becomes more intimate and useful. 
The functions of the library extend beyond the storing and provision 
of material for reading and study, and include, besides bibliography 
and reference, the use of its building as a place of deposit for collec- 
tions in science, art, or history, and as a place of assembly for lec- 
tures, club meetings, exhibitions, and all interests outside the schools 
which promote education and culture. The present movement to 
broaden the scope of library activities is noticeable in nearly all 
civilized lands. 
In this country the tax-supported public library, like the public 
school, is now the accepted type, because both are recognized as integral 
parts of our system of public education. Furthermore, following the 
example of the public-school systems, which have developed under 
State care and support, the aid and encouragement of the State is 
now accorded to public-library systems to enable them to fulfill 
their function of furnishing free books to all the people. Thirty-five 
States are now conducting library extension work, either through 
commissions or through other bodies serving similar purposes. 
‘Despite differences in organization and methods, the common aim of 
these State agencies is to encourage the establishment of libraries in 
all communities able to support them and to promote the efficiency 
lof libraries already existing. In 29 States books are made more

   widely accessible by means of traveling libraries, designed especially 
to reach the rural population, large portions of which are still unprovided 
with book facilities. 
Many local libraries also, especially those in the larger cities, are 
performing for their communities valuable extension work, of which 
no adequate account can be given in this chapter. One important 
phase of this service is that rendered toward Americanizing and per- 
paring for citizenship the foreign immigrants massed in large centers 
of population. 
One of the most absorbing topics at the meeting of the American 
Library Association at Pasadena in May, 1911, was that of library 
extension, and the movement is believed to have received its greatest 
impetus at this conference. The League of Library Commissions, 
including 26 State bodies in its membership, is an affiliated organ- 
ization of the American Library Association and meets with it. 
At their joint session in 1911 the various administrative units in 
library extension—State, county, township, city—were discussed, 
and it was seen that the county system, with State supervision, is 
gaining favor. 
The movement toward coordination among libraries, one phase of 
which is the interlibrary loan system, is closely allied to library 
extension, and is making steady progress. The American Library 
Association through committees has given considerable attention 
to this problem. A bureau of information and a central lending 
library have been proposed, which, if funds were available for their 
establishment, might render distinct service to American scholars 
and to college and reference libraries. The collection and dissem- 
ination of information regarding the resources of American libraries 
is one branch of this movement. 
A detailed account follows of current conditions and progress in 
those States which officially recognize the library extension move- 
ment, with the exception of New Hampshire, from which no recent 
reports on this subject are available. 
ALABAMA, 
The work of public and school library extension, and allied activi 
ties, such as are usually performed by library commissioners, is ii 
Alabama carried on under the direction of a library-extension divisio 
of the State department of archives and history, at Montgomery, 
established in 1907. 
Library legislation in Alabama may be grouped as (1) the statuto: 
provisions for the organization and support of a State and suprem 
court library; (2) the maintenance of historical and _legislativ 
reference collections by the department of archives and history 
(3) a very few special acts incorporating local library associations 
 
-P-A-G-E-183
LIBRARY EXTENSION IN THE UNITED STATES. 163 
(4) provision for unlimited municipal support; (5) the legis) :tion for 
the organization of the library-extension division, as follows: 
It shall encourage and assist in the establishment of public and school libraries, 
and in the improvement and strengthening of those already in existence; it shall 
give advice and provide assistance to libraries and library workers in library adminis- 
tration, methods, and economy; and it shall conduct a system of traveling libraries. 
From its very beginning, the efforts of the division have been 
directed to arousing and shaping public opinion throughout the 
State looking to the establishment of new public and school libraries, 
as well as to strengthening those already in existence. This has 
been done through correspondence, public addresses, and personal 
visits and advice on the part of the director of the department and 
the assistant in charge of the librery-extension division. The press, 
the club women, and the heads of educational institutions have 
been valuable allies in the movement. Beginning in 1908, the 
division offers each year a five veeks’ summer course in library 
training. 
Stations for traveling libraries, the first of which went out in 
1907, have been established, mainly in rural communities and 
schools. During 1910 the division acquired by gift about 100 books 
printed in type for the blind. 
The Legislature of Alabama at its 1911 session passed a law, 
which has been approved, by which $100 is to be appropriated 
annually for each county for the purpose of establishing and main- 
taining libraries in the public schools, and $10 may be appropriated 
for each district public school in the county in any one year, provided 
its patrons and friends raise alike amount. The State superintendent 
of education shall compile and publish a select and annotated list 
of books from which the libraries shall be chosen, and is authorized 
to regulate other details. 
A section of the appropriation bill for the ordinary expenses of 
the State government grants $5,000 annually for the further develop- 
ment and enlargement of the library-extension, work, public reference 
work, and other needs of the department of archives and history. 
CALIFORNIA. 
The California State library carries on the work which in many 
States is under supervision of a public-library commission. It has 
a special department for extension work, but every department is 
active along extension lines. The counties, also, are cooperating in 
the work since the passage of the county library laws of 1909 and 
1911. 
In California, the great size of the State and the increase in rural 
population present problems which State traveling libraries and 
small municipal libraries have proved inadequate to meet. With 
 
-P-A-G-E-184
164 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
the conviction that. the two cardinal defects in existing library 
organization in California should be remedied—namely, insufficiency 
of funds and incompleteness of service to all the people—the county 
has been adopted as a logical unit, because it is of a workable size 
and is better able to furnish adequate support; and with each 
county carrying on this work the entire State will be receiving 
definite and local library service. The county libraries give particular 
attention to supplying books for the use of public-school pupils, 
and in this regard the system is developing marked efficiency. 
The main points of the law of 1911, now in force, are as follows: 
1. The supervisors of any county may establish a county free 
library for that part of such county lying outside of incorporated 
cities and towns maintaining free public libraries, and for all such 
additional portions of such county as may elect to become a part 
of, or to participate in, such county free library system. 
2. Any incorporated city or town maintaining a free public libtmey 
may, by action of its city council, become a part of the county free 
library system. 
3. Any incorporated city or town may contract with the county 
free library for such service as it may desire. 
4, Counties may contract with each other for joint library service. 
5. A board of library examiners is created, composed of the 
State librarian, the librarian of the San Francisco Public Library, 
and the librarian of the Los Angeles Public Library, to certificate 
applicants for the position of county librarian. 
6. A tax levy not to exceed 10 cents on $100 may be made to 
support the county free library. 
7. If a county does not wish to establish a library of its own, an 
alternative method is offered by means of a contract which may be 
entered into by the board of supervisors with any city library, the 
latter agreeing to extend its service to the county. 
Previously the organization of county free libraries had been 
carried on under the contract plan of the 1909 law, and 12 counties 
had established the system, appropriating from $1,200 to $12,000 
a year to carry on the work. Under the new law, the system is 
steadily being extended to additional counties. 
The reference department of the State library furnishes information 
to any inquirer. It furnishes books to public libraries, or any other 
educational institution, on application; to individuals, through the 
signature of a State officer, of the librarian of the local library, or of 
the official head of any other educational institution, or on receipt of a 
$5 deposit; to a club or grange on request of its president, secretary, 
or librarian. The State library pays the cost-of transportation to 
anyone borrowing through a county free library, but in every other 
instance the charges both ways are paid by the borrower.
-P-A-G-E-185
  
LIBRARY EXTENSION IN THE UNITED STATES. 165 
There is also a legislative and municipal reference department, 
with a State-wide service to officials and individuals. 
The extension department of the State library was established in 
1903, and began work in that year by sending out traveling libraries 
to communities without library facilities. The department now has 
three separate divisions—traveling libraries, public libraries, and 
books for the blind. 
Traveling libraries were made up of 50 volumes each, and were sent 
to any community without a public library on the application of five 
resident taxpayers. There was no charge for the use of these libraries, 
and the transportation both ways was paid by the State library. 
Since June 10, 1911, no traveling libraries have been sent out, as on 
that date the board of library trustees decided to withdraw them until 
further notice. 
The public libraries division aims to keep in close touch with all 
the libraries of the State, and since 1905 library organizers have been 
kept in the field to encourage the establishment of libraries, to visit 
those already established, and to give advice and assistance in regard 
to library methods, buildings, etc. 
According to 1911 statistics, there are in California 123 libraries 
supported by city taxation, of which 13 are free to residents of the 
whole county, and of these 12 are partly supported by the respective 
counties; 68 law libraries, of which 56 are county law libraries; 58 
county teachers’ libraries (1 for each county of the State); 308 
libraries in educational institutions, of which 5 are universities, 14 
colleges, 6 normal schools, 217 public high schools, 66 private schools 
and other institutions;.42 miscellaneous institution libraries, and 69 
association or society libraries; 66 subscription libraries. In con- 
nection with the above libraries there are 204 branches and deposit 
stations. There are 104 library buildings, of which 93 were gifts, 
and of these gifts 76 were from Andrew Carnegie. 
The legislature of 1911, by resolution, appointed a committee con- 
sisting of the State library trustees and the justices of the district 
court of appeal, third district, to investigate the need of a building 
for the library and the courts, and to report its findings to the goy- 
ernor prior to the legislative session of 1913. 
COLORADO. 
The Colorado board of library commissioners, established 1899, 
gives advice upon library matters through the Denver Public Li- 
brary, and its publication of the library laws of the State has led 
to the establishment of libraries in a number of towns. The board 
has received no regular appropriation, and has no employees. Its 
membership consists of Charles R. Dudley, president, public library,

Denver; George M. Lee, secretary, Denver; Edwin H. Park, Harper 
Leiper, Alfred E. Whitaker. 
The Colorado traveling library commission was established in 
1903, through the efforts of the Colorado Federation of Women’s 
Clubs, for the purpose of maintaining and developing the system of 
traveling libraries which had been inaugurated by the federation in 
1899. 
The aims of the commission are to make the traveling library of the 
greatest usefulness, by ascertaining the needs of isolated communities 
or districts, and supplying these needs as far as possible; to help small 
public libraries by supplying recent fiction, thus enabling them to 
invest their funds in reference and other books of permanent value; 
to lend books to study clubs; and to cooperate with the teacher in the 
rural school by providing good reading matter for the children. 
Traveling libraries are loaned without charge to any town in the 
State upon application, the person to whom the box is sent being per- 
sonally responsible for its safe return at the end of six months. 
The libraries are of three kinds: (1) Miscellaneous collections of 50 
volumes’each, intended for the use of the general public; (2) juvenile 
libraries of 50 volumes each, for use in country schools, Sunday 
schools, and industrial schools; and (3) small collections of reference 
books for the use of clubs and study classes. At the close of 1910 the 
traveling libraries numbered 241 boxes of 50 volumes each, with a 
total valuation of $12,000. Of these boxes, 96 were juvenile and 145 
miscellaneous collections. In spite of a rapid increase in the number 
of boxes, the supply is still not equal to the demand. 
The commission also distributes boxes of magazines and paper- 
bound books to farmers, mill men, railroad men, hospitals, engine 
houses, police stations, jails, reformatories, and prisons. These are 
not returned, but are used and passed on until worn-out. Through 
the cooperation of the club women in the different towns throughout 
the State, the work of establishing a chain of library stations for the 
distribution of periodicals has been undertaken. 
The law provides that all members of the Colorado traveling 
library commission shall be women, appointed by the governor from 
a list submitted by the executive board of the Federation of Women’s 
Clubs. The incumbents are Mrs. Julia V. Welles, president, Denver; 
Mrs. James D. Whitmore, Denver; Mrs. Z. X. Snyder, Greeley; Mrs. 
Frank Wood, Trinidad; Mrs. P. J. McHugh, Fort Collins. 
The friends of library extension in Colorado have inaugurated a 
movement to amend the State constitution in such a way as to make 
it possible to create the office of State librarian, and concentrate all 
the library activities of the State in charge of this officer. Under this 
new head would be placed the State library (now in charge of the 
State superintendent of public instruction), the traveling library
-P-A-G-E-187

(the commission going out of existence), the historical society, the 
teachers’ reading circle, and the library commission; there would be 
established a legislative reference department, a library training 
school, and any other library activities that might be demanded by 
the people. 
CONNECTICUT. 
The expenditure of the annual State grant to public libraries is in 
charge of the public library committee, which also gives to communi- 
ties advice and assistance in the organization and establishment of 
free public libraries, and extends to all such institutions aid in select- 
ing and cataloguing books and in library management. In the per- 
formance of these duties numerous visits of inspection are made to 
libraries throughout the State both by members of the committee and 
by an official visitor appointed by it. Special emphasis has been laid 
on the right of neighborhoods remote from town centers to library 
service, and the formation of branch libraries has consequently been 
encouraged. During the fiscal year ending September 30, 1910, the 
State granted for books $8,459.86 to 92 public libraries out of a total 
number in Connecticut of 169. 
An annual institute for the professional training of librarians is held 
at some accessible location for two weeks during each summer. 
The traveling libraries handled by the committee consist of collec- 
tions of a general character, circulated among neighborhoods and 
public libraries; libraries for school use, circulated among schools; 
libraries on special subjects, accompanied by pictures, loaned to clubs 
and libraries; libraries in foreign languages, circulated among neigh- 
borhoods and libraries; and home libraries, loaned to individuals and 
families. During 1910 the system of distributing home libraries by 
means of house-to-house delivery by a book wagon was tried in one 
town. It is reported that the number of books loaned and the enthu- 
siasm in the town indicate that this undertaking will soon pass the 
experimental stage, and may profitably be extended so far as the ap- 
propriation will permit. 
In addition to the collections owned by the committee, libraries 
loaned by the Connecticut Society of Colonial Dames, the Connecticut 
Audubon Society, and by*women’s clubs and individuals are circu- 
lated among neighborhoods and schools. The total number of vol- 
umes in all traveling libraries circulated by the committee is 8,347. 
The committee also has a large collection of miscellaneous pictures, 
partly owned by the committee and partly loaned by the Connecticut 
Society of Colonial Dames, which are distributed among schools and 
libraries. u 
School libraries in Connecticut have a grant from the State and 
are permitted to buy books through the public library committee. 
In 1910 there were in the State 1,550 schoolhouses, while 1,016 public 
 
-P-A-G-E-188
  168 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911, 
schools had libraries, containing 269,540 volumes. The number of 
libraries and volumes has steadily increased within recent years. The 
amount of library grant paid from the State treasury to 160 school 
districts during the fiscal year ended September 30, 1910, was $8,155, 
while the districts expended for this purpose $29,542.05. 
The Society of Colonial Dames circulates through the committee 
traveling libraries and portfolios of pictures. These libraries are sent 
to schools, with transportation paid, and may be retained three 
months. The Audubon Society sends libraries, portfolios, and sets 
of bird charts to schools. 
The members of the Connecticut Public Library committee are 
Charles D. Hine, chairman, and Caroline M. Hewins, secretary, Hart- 
ford; Henry A. Tirrell, Norwich; Edwin B. Gager, Derby. 
DELAWARE. 
The State library commission was established in 1901 to promote 
the establishment and efficiency of free public libraries in incorporated 
towns. In 1903 the law regarding the establishment of public libra- 
ries was amended so that now it is possible for any school district in 
the State to establish a public library. The commission has made an 
effort to have every incorporated town vote on the question of estab- 
lishing a library under this law. Advice and assistance is given to 
towns in the establishment of libraries, and statistics of libraries are 
collected. An amount equal to one-half the minimum amount author- 
ized to be raised in districts of its class may be given annually to each 
public library. This direct aid varies from $12.50 to $125. 
The commission maintains a system of traveling libraries, which. 
have been acquired by gift and by purchase. Each library contains 
about 50 volumes and is loaned free of charge for three months. to 
(1) any school, Sunday school, college, or seminary upon application 
of its principal; (2) any village, town or community, study or other 
club, grange, post, lodge, business corporation, or other similar organi- 
zation, which will form a library association of not less than five 
members; (3) any library upon application of its trustees or commis- 
sioners. A few collections of books for study are loaned to women’s 
clubs, and. special loans are made to teachers and also to individuals 
when possible to give assistance to those pursuing particular lines of 
study. 
The commission states in its report for 1909-10 that it is encouraged 
by a growing public interest in the subject of free libraries, and a more 
general appreciation by the public of their importance, both in 
advancing the cause of education and raising the standards of culture 
and good citizenship. 
In 1909 the traveling libraries were circulated 95 times; in 1910, 107 
times. Including the women’s clubs, study classes, and individuals,
-P-A-G-E-189

there were 219 applications, and 5,192 books sent out in 1910. Within 
these two years 11 new libraries were added to the collection, making 
a total of 77 traveling libraries. 
There are 4 libraries, each containing from 20 to 25 volumes, on 
special subjects—country life, domestic science, gardening, and poul- 
try; also mission study libraries containing books relating to the 
various mission fields. 
Many teachers in different parts of the State have written the com- 
inission to tell of the great help and advantage the traveling library 
books have been to the children in the schools and Sunday schools. 
The members of the State library commission are Daniel W. Corbit, 
chairman, Odessa; Mrs. James W. Anthony, Smyrna; A. L. Bailey, 
Wilmington; Mrs. C. E. Burchenal, Wilmington; Henry P. Cannon, 
Bridgeville; Mrs. Charles R. Miller, Wilmington; Mrs. Henry Ridgely, 
Dover; G. W. Murray, Viola. The secretary is H. Ridgely Harring- 
ton, State librarian, Dover. 
GEORGIA. 
The Georgia library commission, of five members, was created by 
the legislature in 1897 to give advice and counsel to all communities 
in the State regarding the establishment and management of libraries. 
The commission may also send its members to aid in organizing new 
libraries or improving those already established. Because of impedi- 
ments in the State constitution, no appropriation has been granted 
the commission since its organization, but through the cooperation of 
the Carnegie Library of Atlanta the commission has rendered much 
assistance to library undertakings throughout the State. 
The members of the commission are Julia T. Rankin, chairman, 
Atlanta; Mrs. J. K. Ottley, Atlanta; Walter Brooks, Rome; Carleton 
B. Gibson, Columbus; Bridges Smith, Macon. 
The tenth meeting of the Georgia Library Association, which was 
held in Athens April 17-19, 1911, was in many ways one of the most 
profitable gatherings in the history of the association. At the two 
general sessions Mr. Henry E. Legler, librarian of the Chicago Public’ 
Library, was the principal speaker. Chancellor David C. Barrow, of 
the University of Georgia, presented a paper, in which he suggested 
the solution of the problem of State support by the incorporation of 
the library commission with the extension work of the university. 
He believed the secretary of the Georgia commission, if located at 
Athens, ‘‘might give some portion of time to the university library, 
and operating with the other agencies of the university, probably 
with the work in secondary education, as this work is most nearly 
related to the towns, might advise and assist these towns in organ- 
izing libraries.”
-P-A-G-E-190
  170 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
At the meeting of the Georgia Library Association in 1910 State 
School Commissioner Pound made a few remarks on the defective 
library conditions to be found in the country schools of the State. 
Georgia realizes the educational importance of proper library facilities, 
and there is reason to expect that effective measures of library exten- 
sion will soon follow the reorganization of the public-school system 
by the act of 1911. 
The Georgia Federation of Women’s Clubs is prosecuting a useful 
educational work through its library committee, and elsewhere in 
this chapter an account is given of the Seaboard Air Line free traveling 
library system, with headquarters at Middleton, Ga.    
    
            
    
                    
    
   IDAHO. 
The State library commission, established in 1901, operates a sys- 
tem of traveling libraries under the control of the superintendent of 
public instruction, who is ex-officio secretary of the commission. 
The remaining members are the attorney general, secretary of state, 
and president of the University of Idaho. The libraries consist of 
50 volumes each, and are loaned to any community in the State upon 
application of five taxpayers, remaining at each station four months. 
A competent person is appointed librarian and is made responsible 
for the books. The expense of transportation, which is a consider- 
able item in Idaho, is borne by the commission. 
The law requires that at least 3 per cent of all the moneys annually 
appropriated to the school districts shall be applied by the trustees 
for the maintenance of school libraries, and that books must be pur- 
chased from a list recommended by the State board of education. 
The State superintendent declares in her latest report (1909-10) that 
in all the districts where this law has been complied with the results 
have proved that it is a wise measure, and its enforcement has been 
of untold benefit to the schools. At the close of 1910, a total of 
84,882 volumes in the school libraries of Idaho was reported, as against 
77,102 volumes August 31, 1910, and 67,682 volumes August 31, 1909. 
The amount expended for libraries during 1908-9 was $19,995.47, 
and during 1909-10 was $20,741.87. 
ILLINOIS. 
The act providing for the establishment of the Illinois library 
extension commission became a law July 1, 1909. The members of 
the commission created by the law were appointed in September, 
1909, by the State library commission, which is the governing body) 
of the State library. They are James A. Rose, secretary of state, 
chairman; Mrs. Eugenie M. Bacon, secretary, Decatur; and Josep 
H. Freeman, Aurora. An organizer was appointed in January, 1910 
and assumed active duties March 1, 1910. 
 
-P-A-G-E-191
  
LIBRARY EXTENSION IN THE UNITED STATES, 171 
It is the duty of the commission to give advice and information 
to the librarian or trustees of any existing public library, or to any 
person or community interested in starting a new public library, con- 
cerning the organization, maintenance, or administration of any 
such. The commission shall operate traveling libraries, and through 
its organizer keep informed of the condition, scope, and. methods of 
work of the various public libraries of the State. Its advisory work 
is done through the organizer by correspondence, or by personal 
visits wherever requested. 
The Illinois Federation of Women’s Clubs presented its traveling 
library collections to the commission, and the books from this source 
have been merged in the general stock for traveling library purposes. 
After nine months of service devoted largely to field work, the 
organizer reported in January, 1911, that the commission law had 
_ to be entirely satisfactory, and that it covers all necessary 
mes. Public interest and cooperation had been everywhere mani- 
fested. 
There are now but 27 counties in the State without a public 
library, out of a total number of 102. 
The Illinois Library Association, at its meeting in October, 1911, 
appointed a committee to consider the need of a codification of the 
State library laws, and to report at the next annual meeting in 1912. 
INDIANA. 
The public library commission endeavors to secure the establish- 
ment of public libraries in localities able to support them, visits 
libraries for the purpose of giving advice and instruction, conducts a 
summer school for librarians, cooperates with the Indiana Library 
Association in holding district meetings, maintains a system of travel- 
ing libraries, and endeavo's to bring about a closer relation between 
libraries and other educational agencies. The secretary gives much 
of his time to advisory work, through correspondence and in personal 
visits to towns. 
The latest report of the commission, for the biennial period ending 
September 30, 1910, states that there are now in Indiana 125 public 
libraries, 22 of which have been added during these last two years, 
and 73 of which have been established since 1899, when the com- 
mission was organized. In 1906 there were 25 counties lacking public 
libraries; now there are 17. Fifteen cities out of a total of 94 do not 
have public libraries. Two of these 15 have large college libraries, 
and of the others only 4 have an assessed valuation of as much as 
$1,000,000. 
In 1899 there was but one librarian in the State who had graduated 
from a library school. At present there are 49 librarians who have 
had a one or two year course, and 91 who have had a summer-school
-P-A-G-E-192
    
172 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
course, making a total of 140 librarians and assistants who have had 
professional training. In 1908 there were 131. 
For rural library extension Indiana employs a township plan 
which is meeting with marked success. Briefly stated, this law 
provides that a public library in any city or incorporated town may 
extend its privileges to all the people of the township or townships in 
which such city or town is situated, or to the people of any neighboring 
township in the same county, on the condition of contribution by 
said township or townships to the support of such library. The plan 
becomes operative when the library board of such public library 
signifies its consent, and when the township advisory board makes a 
levy, either on its own initiative or on petition by 50 resident tax- 
payers. The country patrons of the library are then entitled to the 
same grade of service as that enjoyed by the city residents. 
The public-school libraries of Indiana vary in size from the small 
schoolroom collection of reading-circle books in the district school to 
the well organized high-school library of several thousand volumes 
with a trained librarian in charge. In the majority of towns and 
cities where public libraries have been established, the general 
library collections of the public schools have been transferred to the 
respective public libraries and only reference books have been 
retained in the school. In towns and rural communities which, have 
no access to the public libraries it is interesting to note that almost 
every school has a collection of books. An examination of the 
reports submitted to the department of public instruction by the 
county superintendents of the State shows that in these town and 
rural school libraries there are approximately 510,000 volumes, 50,000 
having been added during 1910. These libraries, to a large extent, 
are made up of books purchased from the Indiana teachers’ and 
young people’s reading circle, which, since its organization in 1888, 
has distributed 700,000 books throughout the State. Purchases 
were made during 1910 by every county in the State. The books, 
which are selected by the board of directors of the reading circle and 
are designed to furnish general culture reading for school children, 
include fiction, travel, biography, science, nature study, poetry, and 
history, and are graded to meet the needs of the eight grades in the 
common schools. These libraries are kept in the schoolhouses and 
are circulated only during the school year. 
The following general statistics of school libraries in Indiana for 
1909-10 are given by the State superintendent of public instruction: 
Volumes in libraries, 1,172,251; volumes circulated, 1,973,230; books 
added, 98,492; members of young people’s reading circle, 103,135. 
During 1909-10 the activities in the traveling library department 
developed rapidly. About 1,200: new books were purchased in this 
time, and the circulation largely increased. Two hundred and six
-P-A-G-E-193
  
LIBRARY EXTENSION IN THE UNITED STATES. 173 
new stations were established and 81 stations previously established 
were served. The latest report gives 100 stations holding libraries 
and enough requests on file to cover the number of books on hand. 
The books are loaned in three groups or classes: (a) Fixed 
general collection of 40 books; (6) fixed group on one subject varying 
in number of volumes from 12 to 20; (c) an open-shelf collection, 
from which special requests are filled and loans made in small or 
large groups, as the case may demand. This open-shelf collection 
was inaugurated in the spring of 1910 and is proving highly satis- 
factory. 
Noteworthy library legislation was enacted by the general assembly 
of 1911. The law establishing the legislative reference department 
of the State library was amended so as to broaden the scope of the 
legislative reference work. The department is now authorized to 
collect material on municipal subjects and to furnish such material 
to city and town officers on request. It is also authorized to cooper- 
ate with the State educational institutions in any manner approved 
by the State librarian and the State library board. 
The annual allowance of the public library commission for the next 
two years was increased from $7,000 to $10,000, and $100,000 was 
appropriated for a new library building for Purdue University. 
The present members of the public library commission are Jacob P. 
Dunn, president, Indianapolis; Mrs. Elizabeth C. Earl, Connersville; 
and William W. Parsons, Terre Haute. Carl H. Milam is secretary 
and State organizer. 
IOWA. 
For over 10 years the Iowa library commission has been actively 
engaged in directing the extension work throughout.the State, stim- 
ulating and aiding communities to provide local public collections of 
books. Struggling libraries are encouraged and fostered, higher 
standards of book selection are promoted, and the service that 
libraries may render communities, in making more intelligent citi- 
zens, is emphasized. As an active agent in this work the commission 
employs an organizer who is constantly engaged in the field. Small 
towns, and country neighborhoods also, that can not maintain public 
libraries, are provided with good literature by means of traveling 
libraries, under the direction of the commission. The growth of 
library interest in the decade has been most gratifying, though there 
remains much undeveloped territory in the State. 
The report of the commission for the two years ending June 30, 
1910, gives the number of free public libraries in Iowa as 106. One 
or more may be found in every county in the State, with the excep- 
tion of:18, in several of which, however, there are association libraries 
likely to become eventually free public libraries.
-P-A-G-E-194
  174 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
Iowa has provided for rural library extension by enacting that 
public libraries may extend the free use of their books to those resid- 
ing in the country adjacent to the town or city in which the library 
is located. ‘This law provides that a township, through its trustees, 
may vote a tax to be paid toward the support of a public library in 
a neighboring town and in return enjoy all the privileges of the 
library. In regions where small villages exis+ these are made the 
centers of distribution; in other localities the book collections are 
placed in churches, schoolhouses, or farm residences. Interest, and 
even enthusiasm, have been aroused in the townships where this 
system has been inaugurated. 
Each summer the secretary of the library commission conducts a 
summer school for library training at Iowa City under the joint 
auspices of the library commission and the State University of Iowa. 
For six weeks instruction is given in the fundamentals of. library 
methods, with the needs of the inexperienced librarians of the smaller 
institutions and of teachers in care of school libraries especially in 
view. The eleventh annual session of the school was held in 1911. 
The Iowa library commission maintains a traveling library system 
as an important feature of its work. The books may be loaned to 
local public libraries, to library associations created for the purpose, 
to groups of 10 taxpayers, to clubs, schools, and other organizations, 
and to individuals, free of cost except for transportation. Two dis- 
tinct collections of books are kept: The regular libraries arranged in 
fixed groups of 50 volumes each, of a miscellaneous character for gen- 
eral reading, and the general loan or “open-shelf” collection, from 
which libraries are made up to meet the needs of applicants. 
The increasing use of the traveling library during 1908-1910 is 
attested by the fact that the number of requests for books almost 
doubled that of the previous biennial period, being 2,271, as against 
1,498 for 1906-1908. Each of these requests represents the loan of a 
varied number of volumes, amounting to a total number of 49,113 
‘ books. Back of these figures in most cases lies painstaking and care- 
ful examination of many books to find the material exactly fitted to 
the needs of the applicant. 
The commission cooperates with the agricultural extension depart- 
ment of the State College at Ames, by the loan of books for traveling 
exhibits and for the short courses. Many agricultural clubs have 
thus been led to make use of the traveling library. The agricul- 
tural extension department has issued a study outline on “Home, 
school, and community life,” for the use of clubs of farmers’ wives, 
which was developed by the traveling library staff from topics fur- 
nished by the agricultural department. Lists of reference books 
and printed matter covering this outline are available from the tray- 
eling library. ;
-P-A-G-E-195
LIBRARY EXTENSION IN THE UNITED STATES. 175 
The traveling library provides a list of books and references on the 
annual subject of debate, selected by the State high-school debating 
league. Many debating teams in small towns depend entirely upon 
the traveling library for their material, and would not be able to 
enter the contest without it. The commission also circulates travel- 
ing library debate collections on a series of subjects additional to those 
used by the high-school debating league. Close cooperation is main- 
tained also with the Iowa Federation of Women’s Clubs in connection 
with their study club work and with the State Young Men’s 
Christian Association in boys’ work. 
The members of the Iowa library commission are Johnson Brigham, 
chairman, Des Moines; John G. Bowman, Iowa City; A. M. Deyoe, 
Des Moines; Mrs. Horace M. Towner, Corning; Mrs. David W. Norris, 
Grinnell; Mrs. Henry J. Howe, Marshalltown; Mrs. A. J. Barkley, 
Boone. Alice S. Tyler, Des Moines, is secretary. 
KANSAS. 
The traveling library movement in Kansas was begun by club 
women, who collected by donation for this purpose 3,000 books, 
which were placed under the supervision of the Kansas Social Science 
Federation. The law now in effect, which was passed at the legisla- 
tive session of 1899, established the Kansas traveling libraries com- 
mission as an adjunct of the State library, and made an appropriation 
of $1,000 a year for its support. The 3,000 books and 34 cases, accu- 
mulated by the Social Science Federation, were transferred to the 
commission, and are still in use. The traveling library system has 
become an assured institution of the State, with no competitor as a 
popular philanthropic movement. The commission now has 35,000 
volumes, and 525 cases for shipping the books, with a yearly appro- 
priation of $5,000 for its support. 
The traveling library is regarded as a public library for the State, 
serving the people in less populous districts as the public library of a 
city or town serves the people of its community, though the books 
circulate in a somewhat different way. Local libraries, or any group 
of people in Kansas, such as clubs, societies, reading circles, Sunday 
schools, or public schools, may have 50 books for six months for $2, 
to defray the -cost of transportation. The libraries cover a wide 
range of subjects, and are made up as nearly as possible to suit the 
requirements of the subscribers. An extension of the period of loan 
may be arranged upon the payment of a fee of 25 cents per month. 
The traveling library, with all of its possibilities, has especially 
appealed to and filled the needs of the people of Kansas, for public 
libraries are not yet numerous, notwithstanding the great develop- 
ment during recent years. To the traveling libraries much of this 
progress is due, as their visits have frequently been the first genuine

176 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
incentive the small town has had for a library of its own. There are 
some communities 40 miles from the nearest railway station which 
receive these books. The whole work has grown in extent beyond 
the most hopeful expectations of its promoters, and its influence 
and educational results are felt more widely over the State than 
could have been anticipated at the outset. 
The commission now has five German libraries, which are sent out 
under the same regulations as the other books. A few special 
libraries have been purchased for correspondence courses in univer- 
sity extension work, conducted by the State University. There are 
three each on American history, American literature, psychology, 
and education, each containing from 4 to 13 books, which are sent 
out under special terms. Aside from the German books and the 
libraries just mentioned, the unit or fixed-group system is not in use 
in the Kansas traveling libraries. Every collection of books as it 
comes in is unpacked and placed on the shelves, a method which 
involves far more labor than the unit system, but which in some 
important respects is more satisfactory. 
During the two years ending June 30, 1910, 1,000 traveling libraries, 
including 9 special libraries, were sent out, showing an increase of 
196 over the figures for the preceding biennium. The service has 
reached 104 counties and 580 towns, many of which are regular 
patrons, ordering up to 8 libraries a year. 
A collection of carbon photographic reproductions of the world’s 
famous paintings, known as the “ Aplington Art Gallery,’’ has been 
placed under the care and management of the Kansas traveling 
libraries commission. These pictures were accumulated by the 
Kansas Federation of Women’s Clubs, aided by personal contribu- 
tions from Mrs. Kate A. Aplington, of Council Grove, Kans. The 
collection was offered to the State and accepted by the legislature of 
1907. At the time of the latest report in 1910, the gallery comprised 
four practically complete collections—Italian, Dutch and Flemish, 
French, and English, and a partial collection of German reproduc- 
tions, while a representative collection of American pictures was 
expected to be ready for use in the near future. 
The Kansas traveling libraries commission is composed of James L. 
King, State librarian, chairman; Mrs. C. C. Goddard, Lucy B. John- 
ston, Julia E. Brown, and Harry G. Larimer. The secretary is Mrs. 
Adrian L. Greene. 
KENTUCKY. 
A library commission bill framed by a committee composed of 
members of the Kentucky Library Association and the Kentucky - 
Federation of Women’s Clubs was presented to the legislature of 
1910, and after a vigorous campaign for its adoption was passed, 
,
-P-A-G-E-197
LIBRARY EXTENSION IN THE UNITED STATES. 177 
signed by the governor, and went into effect June 13, 1910. The five 
members appointed by the governor fo compose the commission are 
Fannie C. Rawson, Louisville, and May Stone, Hindman, both 
appointed for a term of four years; Frank K. Kavanaugh, Frankfort, 
three years; Mrs. George Alexander Flournoy, Paducah, two years; 
and William B. Doherty, Louisville, one year. Hereafter one mem- 
ber will be appointed each year for a term of four years. These mem- 
bers serve without compensation, the executive officer of the commis- 
sion being the secretary, to which position Fannie C. Rawson has 
been elected. An annual appropriation of $6,000 was made for the 
expenses of the commission, the purpose of which is to promote the 
library interests of the State by increasing the efficiency of libraries 
already in existence, by the establishment of new libraries in com- 
munities where none exist, and by means of a traveling library system 
to provide books and reading for communities and individuals with- 
out library facilities. ; 
The traveling libraries circulated in the mountain districts by the 
Kentucky women’s clubs have been given to the commission and 
form the nucleus of its traveling library collection. The Jefferson 
County traveling library, consisting of 17 cases, has also been given 
to the commission. From these collections, together with new books 
purchased, libraries in fixed groups of 50 each are being made up. 
These libraries are loaned for six months, with the privilege of 
extension for a longer period or of exchange in less time if desired. 
Full supplies, with directions for the management of the library 
according to approved library methods, are sent with each box. In 
order to defray expense of transportation, with justice to all, a uni- 
form charge of $2 is made. An agreement signed by five taxpayers 
is required, which contains a promise to keep the library in an acces- 
sible place, to loan the books without charge, to care for them well, 
and to return them in good condition at the end of the prescribed 
time. 
Each library contains books for adults, young people, and chil- 
dren, and includes reading in fiction, travel, biography, history, and 
prominent topics of the day. A farmer’s library of 15 volumes will 
be substituted for the same number in general reading in a regular 
library when desired, or a separate library of 15 agricultural books 
will be sent at an additional cost of 75 cents for transportation. 
As a part of the traveling library system, the commission main- 
tains an open-shelf collection from which books may be borrowed for 
study or reading upon subjects desired. This collection is being 
used by women’s clubs and others, and will be found increasingly 
helpful as it is enlarged to meet the demands upon it. Only the 
cost of postage or express is charged, and the books may be 
retained 30 days or longer upon application.

This is but a beginning of the work which the commission expects 
to do in the future, both in the lines indicated and in others to be 
taken up later. For example, the public-school libraries will receive 
attention. So far the only work done with them has been the loan 
of traveling libraries and such help and suggestions as have been 
requested through correspondence. Another branch of work which 
must soon be undertaken is the reorganization of the State institu- 
tional libraries. 
In addition to the traveling libraries circulated by the State com- 
mission, county systems are also maintained by women’s @lubs in a 
number of counties. A traveling library system is also operated by 
Berea College through its students and by the library at Henderson. 
Extension work is done in Fayette and Mason Counties by the city 
libraries at Lexington and Maysville, which are also county libraries, 
and other city libraries are likely to follow this example with refer- 
ence to their respective counties. In Louisville, six branches, with 
stations and classroom collections, give a total of 226 centers. Lex- 
ington and Henderson also maintain substations in schoolrooms and 
other centers. 
_ Twenty-two public libraries in Kentucky sent in reports for 1910 
to the State library commission. The total number of volumes 
reported was 235,419, with 24,863 additions during the year. 
MAINE. 
The legislature of 1911 amended the act establishing the Maine 
library commission, prescribing its powers and duties as follows: 
The commission shall give advice to all school, State institutional, free, and public 
libraries, and to all communities in the State which may propose to establish libraries 
as to the best means of establishing and administering them; selecting and cataloguing 
books, and other details of library management; and may send any of its members to 
aid in organizing such libraries or assist in the improvement of those already established. 
It may also receive gifts of money, books, or other property, which may be used or 
held in trust for the purpose or purposes given. It may publish lists and circulars of 
information, and may cooperate with other State library commissions and libraries 
in the publication of documents in order to secure the most economical! administration 
of the work for which it was formed. It may conduct courses or schools of library 
instruction and hold librarians’ institutes in various parts of the State, and cooperate 
with others in such schools or institutes. It shall select the books to be purchased for 
traveling libraries and advise the librarian of the State library in reterence thereto. 
Said commission shall perform such other service in behalf of public libraries as it 
may consider for the best interests of the State. 
The State gives to each public library upon its establishment $100 
worth of books, and annually thereafter an amount equal to 10 per 
cent of the local expenditures for the library. For this purpose the 
State appropriation for the fiscal year 1912 is $7,700, and for traveling 
libraries and expenses of the library commissioners $2,500.

     Libraries of 50 volumes each are loaned to any free library in the 
State upon application of the librarian, or to any association composed 
of five.or more persons residing in a town without a free library, upon 
payment of a fee of $2.50. Books and documents from the State 
library may also be loaned to any responsible citizen of the State, 
on written application therefor and payment of transportation 
charges. 
At the 1911 meeting of the Maine State Teachers’ Association, 
which has an active department of libraries, an interesting example 
of local extension in the way of cooperation between the rural schools 
and the library in Dover and Foxcroft was described by the librarian, 
and State Superintendent Payson Smith spoke on “The rural 
school and its library.” The superintendent’s report shows that 
881 Maine schools had libraries in 1910, an increase of 120 over the 
number for 1909. 
The members of the commission are Mrs. Kate C. Estabrooke, 
president, Orono; W. H. Hartshorn, Lewiston; Mrs. Lizzie Jewett- 
Butler, Mechanic Falls; J. H. Winchester, Corinna. The secretary 
is H. C. Prince, State librarian. 
MARYLAND. 
The legislature of 1902 passed two library laws and established two 
commissions. The more important bill, introduced under the aus- 
pices of the State Federation of Women’s Clubs, provided a commis- 
sion of seven members, comprising the State librarian, superintendent 
of public education, and librarian of the Enoch Pratt free library, 
ex-officio, and four persons biennially appointed by the governor, 
two of them to be women. An annual appropriation of $1,000 was 
made for the commission, who served without pay, but received 
actual expenses. Their duties were to “give advice and counsel to 
all free libraries and public-school libraries in the State, and to all 
committees proposing to establish them, as to the best means of their 
establishment and maintenance, the selection of books, cataloguing, 
and other details of management.’’ The commission was also 
empowered to organize and conduct traveling libraries throughout 
the State, and proceeded immediately to do so. In 1905, a field 
secretary was sent into the counties for a few months, this being the 
‘st appointment of such an officer in any State south of Mason and 
ixon’s line. , 
The other bill enacted in 1902 established a commission of five, 
ppointed by the governor for a term of five years, with an appro- 
riation of $1,000 per annum for its work. This commission’s 
owers were limited to aiding the establishment of county libraries, 
nd. the law applied to only nine counties in the State.
-P-A-G-E-200
  180 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
Two bills relating to libraries were passed by the legislature of 1910, 
one of which repealed the act of 1902 establishing a county library 
commission, and the other was a revised library law for the State, 
prepared by the Maryland State library commission. That commis- 
sion had as its functions the care of traveling libraries, also advice 
to the authorities governing public libraries of municipalities and 
schools and to persons endeavoring to establish such libraries. The 
new law changes the commission’s title to “Maryland Public Library 
Commission,” and confers the additional functions of advising and 
stimulating the establishment of county and election district libraries, 
and of purchasing and sending $100 worth of books to libraries 
established under this act. An annual appropriation of $1,500 was 
granted, which the commission finds inadequate for its work. 
The report of the commission for 1910 states that it has 91 traveling 
libraries, made up of fixed collections of books, which have been 
circulating throughout the State and have been in great demand. 
The groups are both general and special in character, including several 
pedagogical libraries. This branch of the service could with benefit 
be greatly extended if funds were available. It was possible to 
employ the services of a field secretary during only half of the year. 
The members of the Maryland Public Library Commission are 
M. Bates Stephens, State superintendent of public education, presi- 
dent; Mrs. John M. Carter, Mount Washington; Sterling Galt, 
Emmitsburg; Mrs. M. A. Newell, Baltimore; Joseph B. Perkins, 
Towson; Miss Lynn M. Shaffer, State librarian, Annapolis; Bernard 
C. Steiner, secretary, Baltimore. 
The Washington County free library, of Hagerstown, furnishes a 
notable example of service to its rural constituency. It is supported 
partly by income from its endowment and by an annual appropria- 
tion from both county and city. It has also been the recipient of a 
gift of $25,000 from Mr. Andrew Carnegie, to be used for the extension 
of work in the county. It is operated by a central library, with 
children’s room, reading rooms, etc., and 73 stations at’as many 
points in the county. These stations are served by cases holding 
about 50 volumes each, which are placed at the general store, the 
post office, or other public place, being subject to exchange every 
60 or 90 days. Thirty of these stations are located off the line of 
either railroad, trolley, or stage. To facilitate the transportation of 
the cases, and also for the purpose of house-to-house delivery, a book 
wagon makes trips throughout the county. Sixteen routes have been 
laid out, and the wagon is on the road at least two days in the week 
when the weather permits. This library, which possesses 20,000 
volumes, reports a circulation for 1910 of 107,741 volumes.

  LIBRARY EXTENSION IN THE UNITED STATES, 181 
MASSACHUSETTS. 
Massachusetts was the first State in the Union to create a library 
commission for encouraging the establishment of libraries by direct 
aid, and for giving advice relating to the maintenance and administra- 
tion of libraries. The law to this effect was enacted in 1890, and 
authorized the commission to give each town $100 worth of books 
upon the establishment of a library in accordance with an earlier 
act relating to the election, powers, and duties of trustees of free 
libraries. In 1890, 103 towns were without a free public library, and 
by 1904, every town in the State enjoyed the privileges of such an 
institution. Massachusetts now has the distinction of being the 
only American State which has a public library in every town. 
In 1892, an act was passed authorizing the commission to give 
$100 worth of books to those towns of less than $600,000 valuation 
which had established libraries previous to 1890. To still further 
aid the poorer towns, the commission: was authorized in 1900 to 
give an additional $100 worth of books to the towns of less than 
$600,000 valuation. Again, in 1906, an act was passed whereby the 
commission might annually expend a sum not exceeding $2,000 in 
aid of free libraries, especially in towns the valuation of which does 
not exceed $600,000. This law is more elastic than the previous 
acts, and “aid may include the furnishing of books in small quantities, 
visits to libraries, the instruction of librarians, and such other means 
of encouraging and stimulating the small libraries as said com- 
missioners shall deem advisable.” An act of 1910 authorizes the com- 
mission to appoint an agent. 
In addition to the service rendered without compensation by the 
individual members of the commission, an unpaid board of advisory 
visitors was organized in 1908, the members of which visit small 
libraries, report to the commission the conditions which they find, 
and make recommendations. In this way the ‘‘personal touch” has 
reached most of the smaller and many of the larger towns. The 
board of advisory visitors for 1910-11 numbers 28 members, and 
during 1910 more than 80 libraries were visited by them, in addi- 
tion to rendering advice in answer to inquiries by personal consulta- 
tion, mail, or telephone. 
During 1910, the commission, with the aid of the Woman’s Educa- 
tion Association of Boston, supplied 94 towns and villages with 
traveling libraries. Thirty-three sets of pictures were circulated 
during the year. 
A noteworthy feature in the reports for 1910 of Massachusetts 
libraries to the commission is the increasing attention paid to work 
with schools. Most of the libraries report special privileges to 
teachers and pupils, liberal provision of books needed for study, and  
-P-A-G-E-202
  182 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
reference help given by the library. In many places the school is 
employed as a distributing agency, loaning books for general reading 
both to children and to adults. In towns where the population is 
scattered, and the library has only a small income, this plan makes 
the books generally available at little or no expense. In cities, also, 
this method proves its value, bringing the books to children and 
families who have not yet learned to use the library or who live too 
far from a library building to use it readily. Direction by the teacher 
of children’s reading is so beneficial to the regular school studies that 
there is an increasing feeling that teachers should be given more 
training in the use of a library, the relative value of different children’s 
books, and the larger use of reading to supplement the work of the 
textbook. The normal schools, the teachers’ institutes, and the 
meetings of school superintendents give opportunity for such train- 
ing and for increasing the interest of the teachers. The commission 
hopes, through cooperation with the State board of education, to 
bring about increasing attention to the library and its possibilities 
and more definite instruction to teachers. 
Members of the commission: Charles F. D. Belden, chairman, 
Cambridge; Elizabeth P. Sohier, Beverly; Frank H. Howes, Newton; 
Hiller C. Wellman, Springfield; Anna M. Bancroft, Hopedale. Agent, 
Zaidee Brown, State library, Boston. 
MICHIGAN. 
The State board of library commissioners encourages the estab- 
lishment of town libraries by means of the registration system, and 
works in cooperation with the State library, the department of 
public instruction, county commissioners of schools, women’s clubs, 
and county organizers of village ‘and rural libraries. Under the 
registration plan, any library which is free to the public and which 
has on its shelves 100 books, not counting Government and State 
documents, may borrow from the board of library commissioners 
100 books to be kept six months. Upon a further purchase of 
books, another loan will be made, equal to the number purchased. 
This loan will be made to township, district, and school libraries, if 
free to the public. 
In 1907, a county organizer was appointed to carry on library 
work on educational lines. Visits have been made to the more 
isolated parts of the State, and library matters have been presented 
“at State and local teachers’ associations, teachers’ institutes, farm- 
ers’ institutes, and the State fair. 
The courses in elementary library training given at the summer 
normal schools, in session from June 27 to August 6, 1910, were 
reported as the most successful of any which have been carried on 
since the commencement of the work. The object was to give a
-P-A-G-E-203
  
e 
LIBRARY EXTENSION IN THE UNITED STATES. 183 
training for teachers, with special reference to those teaching in the 
rural schools. The instruction was simple and practical, the ex- 
pectation being that the libraries which come under the charge of 
those teachers will range from 50 to 500 volumes. ‘The classes 
were conducted at the Marquette and Kalamazoo normal schools, 
and at the Ferris Institute, Big Rapids. A very complete display 
of library tools and a model library of 500 volumes for children, 
together with a collection of books suitable for the use of teachers 
in the rural schools, were placed in the classroom, and this material 
was examined by a large number of students and others. These 
courses were repeated in 1911. 
Through the offorts of the State board of library commissioners, 
a library section was in 1907 incorporated in the program of the 
Michigan State Teachers’ Association, and at the meeting of the 
Upper Peninsula Educational Association at Negaunee, in October, 
1910, a library section was added to that body. Exhibits of library 
utilities and books, and examples of the loan collection of pictures 
are displayed at the annual meetings of these associations, and 
receive much attention. 
The traveling libraries are under the direction of the State librarian 
and are loaned to towns and villages upon application of a group 
of 20 or 25 taxpayers. Farming communities may apply under 
organizations such as granges, farmers’ clubs, women’s clubs, Ep- 
worth leagues, and similar bodies, and any society formed for the 
purpose of study. An annual fee of $5 pays the transportation 
both ways on four libraries; $1.25 pays the transportation both 
ways on one library. The regular libraries, which may be kept threo 
months, with the privilege of three months’ extension, are made up 
in sets of 50 volumes for general reading. To aid the club women 
of the State, special libraries made up on the program of club work 
are prepared and are loaned under the association application. 
A legislative reference department was established in the State 
library in 1907. The first work of the new department was col- 
lecting information in regard to the constitutions of the various 
States, to aid in the work of preparing a new constitution. 
Steady progress in all lines of the commission’s activities is shown 
in its latest published report, that for 1910. Its members are 
Frederick J. Baldwin, president, Coral; H. R. Pattengill, Lansing; 
Henry Nelson Loud, Au Sable; David E. Heineman, Detroit; Mrs. 
Mary C. Spencer, secretary, Lansing. 
MINNESOTA, 
The creation of the Minnesota Public Library Commission by the 
legislature of 1899 may be regarded as a recognition of the public 
library as a part of the educational system of the State. In carrying 
 
-P-A-G-E-204
    
184 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
out the purpose of the law, the commission has constantly kept in 
view the development of the library system as an adjunct to the 
school, following two general lines of work: First, encouraging the 
establishment of libraries in all communities able to support them, 
and bringing to the highest possible standard of efficiency all the 
libraries in the State; and, second, maintaining a system of traveling 
libraries to aid in solving the problem of making free books accessible 
to the entire population of the State. 
The commission endeavors through every possible means to obtain 
a thorough knowledge of library conditions throughout the State, 
in order that its advice and assistance may be adapted to local needs. 
In towns where no libraries exist, whenever conditions are favorable 
an effort is made to arouse public interest through the cooperation 
of individuals or local organizations. When a library is established 
either by an association or under municipal control, the commission 
gives advice regarding organization and equipment and sends its 
organizer to assist the local librarian in classifying and preparing the 
books for circulation and installing the necessary business records. 
To libraries already established, the commission continues to act as 
a bureau of information, giving advice through correspondence 
and personal visits as to selection of books, technical details, matters 
of administration, and questions of library policy. During 1909-10 
161 visits were made by members of the commission staff to 103 
libraries in 96 towns. 
Closer correlation between school and public libraries has been 
sought, and to this end the commission has been represented at six - 
teachers’ meetings during 1909-10, and held an exhibit at the meeting 
of. the Minnesota Educational Association showing the books listed 
in the “Teachers’ Assistant,’ a publication of the commission, and 
other aids in book selection and library methods for school libraries. 
Arrangements have been made to continue the presentation of library 
work at teachers’ meetings in the future. The commission reports 
that the school libraries are showing a remarkable change; that 
superintendents and school boards are becoming more interested 
in having the libraries organized and put on a-working basis in order 
that they may be more useful and effective, not only for teachers 
and pupils, but also for the people of towns in which there is no 
public library. The question of book selection and the teacher’s 
responsibility for the children’s reading is also receiving more atten- 
tion, and the growth of the idea of making the school a social center 
is enlarging the use of the schoolhouse and making it a more suitable 
location for a public collection of books. 
The commission conducts each year a summer library school, 
offering an elementary course of six weeks. The twelfth annual 
session was held in 1911, with 22 librarians in attendance.
-P-A-G-E-205
  
LIBRARY EXTENSION IN THE UNITED STATES. 185 
Since 1909 the commission has included in its field work the State 
charitable and correctional institutions, and the libraries of these 
institutions have received personal attention from a special organizer. _ 
When the commission began active work in January, 1900, there 
were 30 public libraries established under State law and maintained 
by taxation, 5 free libraries supported by associations, and 13 sub- 
scription libraries. The number of public libraries has now increased 
to 78, while there are 29 free libraries maintained by associations, 
and 10 subscription libraries which charge a fee for the use of the 
books, making a total of 117 circulating libraries. The latest report 
of the commission mentions, besides progress in various towns, en- 
couraging recognition of the value of the library, shown by enlarged 
appropriations at Minneapolis, where the tax levy has been increased 
to eight-tenths of a mill, yielding an annual income of about $160,000, 
of which $50,000 was to be spent at once in building and equipping 
new branches. 
According to a law passed in 1905, any library board may ‘‘con- 
tract with the board of county commissioners of the county in which 
the library is situated or of adjacent counties, or with the village 
trustees or governing body of any neighboring town, city, or village, 
to loan the books of said library, either singly or in traveling libra- 
ries, to the residents of said county, town, city, or village, upon such 
terms as shall be agreed upon in such contract.” This law authorizes 
two distinct. plans: (1) That of county extension, whereby a cen- 
trally located library may extend its privileges to all residents of the 
county upon contract made with the county commissioners, and (2) 
that of township extension, whereby a library may extend its privi- 
leges to adjoining townships or villages upon contract made with the 
governing body of the township or village. Under the county exten- 
sion law and otherwise, 34 libraries are now open without charge to 
borrowers living outside the limits of the municipality. 
The widespread interest in civic improvement throughout the 
State has developed a larger feeling of civic pride in all public insti- 
tutions. The library is feeling this stimulus, and its influence as a 
factor in municipal life is receiving more and more recognition. In 
this connection there is a growing use of the library as a social center, 
and certain phases of this development are noteworthy. For exam- 
ple, the work of the Civic League at Mankato has been closely asso- 
ciated with the library, the librarian being president of the organiza- 
tion and the library being the headquarters for the junior work. 
The same relationship exists in several other places. Most of the 
small library buildings are provided with auditoriums which are 
used regularly by study clubs, and occasionally for lectures, con- 
certs, and similar entertainments. 
 
-P-A-G-E-206
    186 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
The purpose of the traveling library service in Minnesota is prima- 
rily to bring to the people living on the farms and in isolated com- 
munities books for information, culture, and entertainment, which 
they are unable to obtain otherwise because of the distance from 
public libraries and the difficulties and expense of transportation. 
These libraries prove also a valuable adjunct to the small public 
libraries having insufficient book funds, by supplying them with 
fresh books, desirable books for children in good editions, and books 
in foreign languages; and the reference department of the traveling 
library is the base of supply for additional help for students and club 
workers. 
Traveling libraries are loaned to library associations formed by ten 
signers of application cards, to. farmers’ clubs, and to small public 
libraries, and it is aimed to establish a permanent library center in 
every community. For regular traveling libraries no charge is made 
except for transportation, and to equalize this expense a uniform fee 
is charged to all places and the commission pays the freight charges 
both ways. For a 50-volume case the fee is $1; for a 25-volume case, 
50 cents; and for a 25-volume case of foreign books, $1. The ‘‘fixed 
group” plan is used for collections for general reading, while adapta- 
tion to the various localities is attained by the addition of books 
especially desired, groups of books on a special subject or in foreign 
languages, and whole subject libraries for study. 
Upon the request of the extension division of the school of agri- 
culture, the collection of books on agriculture owned by the traveling 
library was increased by the addition of ‘farmers’ libraries,” each 
consisting of 25 books on agriculture and 25 books for general read- 
ing. The titles on agriculture were selected by the school of agricul- 
ture, only those being included which had been tested for value and 
usefulness, and the books for general reading were chosen with 
special regard to their interest in rural communities. 
Many university students are teaching in the rural districts of 
Minnesota and continuing their studies meanwhile. For their use 
books on psychology, child study, and teaching were purchased from 
a list selected by the department of pedagogy of the University of 
Minnesota, and additions have been made from time to time as 
demand warranted. The books are loaned singly or in groups to 
students, and libraries of 25 volumes have been loaned to city or 
county superintendents for the use of their teachers. The books are 
sent upon application of a student having a guarantor for transpor- 
tation charges only. The books recommended by the various depart- 
ments of the university offering correspondence courses have also 
been purchased, and are loaned singly or in groups to students living 
‘away from public libraries.

     The commission reports that requests come in increasing number 
and variety, not only for books for general reading, but also for books 
of practical information and for study in many fields, and that there 
is opportunity for great extension of the work of the traveling library 
in Minnesota. To effect this extension, increased room and resources 
are necessary. 
Members of the commission: Margaret J. Evans, chairman, North- 
field; Gratia A. Countryman, Minneapolis; George E. Vincent, presi- 
dent of University of Minnesota; C. G. Schulz, State superintendent 
of public instruction; Warren Upham, secretary of Minnesota His- 
torical Society, St. Paul. Secretary, Clara F. Baldwin, St. Paul. 
MISSOURI. 
The Missouri library commission was established by the legislature 
of 1907, and consists of five members, three of whom are appointed 
by the governor; the State superintendent of public schools, and the 
president of the State university complete the membership. The 
commission. is authorized to give advice to all school, free, and other 
public libraries, and to all communities which may propose to estab- 
lish them; it may receive gifts of money, books, or other property, 
operate a system of traveling libraries, and in general aid in the 
development of libraries throughout the State. 
A new departure was taken June 1, 1910, in the employment of a 
field worker, to present personally the subject of libraries in the 
counties of the State. The commission reports that the results have 
justified this step. In placing traveling libraries a goodly advance 
has been made, and the interest aroused has promoted the library 
movement in the State. During 2910 the commission assisted 
public libraries in 11 Missouri towns. 
The places reached by traveling libraries in 1910 number 141, 
while 90 was the record for 1909; libraries sent out number 242 in 
1910, 69 more than in 1909; these Histries contained 11,377 volumes, 
and the reported circulation was 19,780 volumes, more than double 
that of the year before (8,922 volumes). The development of the 
department of general loan for clubs, farmers’ institutes, and students 
as placed 443 volumes in the field from the general collection. 
reat demand has been made on this department by the smaller 
igh schools of the State. 
The stock of traveling libraries has been increased during 1910 by 
he addition of 44 groups, distributed among the fixed group, general 
scope; school libraries, middle grade; special libraries for colored 
ral schools; and juvenile libraries. In all 171 groups, varying in 
ize from 40 to 50 volumes, are now owned by the commission. In 
ecember, 1910, 152 of these were in the field, located in 64 counties  
-P-A-G-E-208
    188 E EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
of the State. Some of these places report a circulation of nearly 500 
volumes: for a six months’ period of loan, the average being 175 
volumes each time the library is loaned. The total number of issues 
reported in this way was 19,780 volumes. A number of new patrons 
were secured for the traveling libraries by the exhibit at the State 
fair, October, 1910. In the book purchases for the year, much atten- 
tion has been given to the development of the collection on agri- 
culture. 
The general assembly of 1909 passed a bill creating a general 
assembly library, to censist chiefly of the legislative journals and 
State documents, but opening the door to progressive reference work 
for the legislature. The library thus collected is to be supervised 
by the secretary of the library commission, under the direction of the 
house and senate during sessions, and to be at other times in charge 
of the library commission alone. No appropriation was made for 
this work, but considerable progress has been made in organization. 
The members of the Missouri library commission are J. P. Greene, 
president, Liberty; Adelaide J. Thompson, Jefferson City; Arthur E. 
Bostwick, St. Louis; A. Ross Hill, president of University of Mis- 
souri; William P. Evans, State superintendent of public schools. 
The secretary is Elizabeth B. Wales, Jefferson City. 
NEBRASKA. 
The public library commission of Nebraska was established in 1901, 
chiefly for the encouragement of the establishment of libraries, the 
improvement of those already established, and the extension of read- 
ing facilities by means of traveling libraries. 
The report of the commission for 1909-10 states that Nebraska 
now has 76 public libraries, as compared with 67 in 1908 and 26 in 
1901. There are only three towns in the State having a population 
of over 2,000 which are without libraries, and. one of these has an 
excellent Y. M. C. A. library which furnishes the town with reading. 
During the biennium the commission has given assistance in 
organizing 13 new libraries. The secretary visited 51 libraries, and 
in addition to making personal visits has carried on a large corre- 
spondence, giving advice in regard to organizing and administering 
libraries. With almost no exception Nebraska libraries have good 
systems of administration, and the standards of librarianship are 
unusually high. 
The general traveling libraries are composed of from 40 to 50 
volumes of miscellaneous books for adults and children. Each 
library is made up of a fixed group of 35 volumes of popular works, 
to which from 5 to 15 volumes are added to suit the needs and tastes 
of the community to be served. In addition to the general libra- 
ries there are several school libraries containing books for children
-P-A-G-E-209
  LIBRARY EXTENSION IN THE UNITED STATES. 189 
only—books of general interest and books for supplementary reading. 
Libraries are loaned to any community upon payment of transpor- 
tation charges. From the general loan collection books on special 
subjects are loaned to study clubs, teachers, schools, and individuals. 
During 1909-10, 17,932 volumes were sent out in response to 442 
requests for general traveling libraries, as against 17,280 volumes 
and 432 requests for the preceding two years. In the special loan 
work 4,921 volumes were sent out in response to 636 requests, as 
against 2,789 volumes and 388 requests for the preceding two years. 
During 1909-10 books were sent to 83 counties, showing a’ wide 
distribution over the State. The commission has 25 libraries in the 
Bohemian language, which were out 94 times from 1908 to 1910, and 
were used by 26 towns. 
There is no provision made in the school library law for the method 
of selection and purchase of books, but the commission has printed 
a list of books suitable for a school library, and teachers and directors 
are urged to buy from this list. Many talks are given by the secretary 
at teachers’ institutes and normal schools, and correspondence on the 
subject of book selection is extensive. The secretary also serves as 
an advisory member of the reading circle committee, which makes 
up each year suggestive lists of books for school libraries. 
The library commission has recently cooperated with the university 
extension department of the State University, and has supplied 
students taking the course on Abraham Lincoln with the necessary 
books for study. For this purpose the commission bought 16 sets 
of the complete works of Abraham Lincoln and 20 copies of standard 
biographies. The commission reports that the constant use of these 
books has justified their purchase, and that it is considering the 
further development of this line of work. 
The legislature of 1911 granted the library commission, for the 
_ maintenance of its general operations during the biennium beginning 
April 1, 1911, the sum of $10,000, an increase of $2,000 over the 
allowance for the preceding two years. It also put the supervision 
of the libraries in the State institutions in the hands of the commission, 
and made an appropriation for the biennium of $5,000 for this work. 
An institution librarian has been appointed by the commission. This 
is the first official recognition of the library as an agent in reformatory 
work in the State institutions of Nebraska. 
The members of the Nebraska Public Library Commission are 
F. L. Haller, president, Omaha; Samuel Avery, chancellor of Uni- 
versity of Nebraska; J. E. Delzell, State superintendent of public 
instruction; H. C. Lindsay, State librarian; W. K. Jewett, librarian 
of University of Nebraska. The secretary is Charlotte Templeton, 
Omaha.

  190 . EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
A new law for the establishment and regulation of public libraries 
was enacted by the legislature of 1911, authorizing any city, incor- 
porated village, county, or township to establish a free public library, 
or to contract for the use of a public library already established, and 
to provide the necessary funds by taxation. Any school district 
also may authorize its school board to contract for the use of a public 
library by the inhabitants of such district. Previously only incor- 
porated villages and cities could establish libraries and tax them- 
selves for their maintenance. 
The legislature of 1911 also established a legislative reference 
bureau for the service of legislators, State officials, and citizens 
generally, by means of a special library, publications, and other 
sources of information. The bureau is affiliated with the department 
of political science and sociology and with the college of law of the 
University of Nebraska, and is under the rules and regulations of 
the board of regents of the State University. 
NEW JERSEY. 
The public library commission assists public libraries by giving 
advice and personal assistance in organization, distributes State aid 
to libraries, and has charge of the system of traveling libraries 
and the libraries in penal institutions. Each public library of less 
than 5,000 volumes, upon its establishment under municipal control, 
receives $100 from the State. 
The annual fee for the use of the traveling libraries is $2, to be paid 
in advance. The collections are not restricted to fixed groups, but 
the books are selected to suit the applicants. Charges for conveying 
the libraries to the express office or railroad station nearest their 
destination, and for their return to Trenton, are borne by the commis- 
sion. Traveling libraries are loaned to communities that are without 
library facilities, on the application of taxpayers, who must select a 
trustee and librarian to become responsible for the proper care and 
distribution of the books. 
The commission reports that during 1910 steady and continued 
interest was shown in its work. Fourteen public libraries were 
organized, bringing the total number in the State up to 208, as com- 
pared with 76, partly inactive, listed by the New Jersey Library 
Association in 1900. Twenty-one traveling library stations were 
also established, making the total number 237; 811 traveling lib- 
raries were sent out, containing 40,500 volumes, which, with the 
special loans included, aggregate 41,613. Approximately 118,500 
volumes were circulated through these libraries, at an expense 
for transportation of $603.93. Seven libraries were reorganized; 282 
visits were made; 164 libraries were given aid by advice, instruc- 
tion, book lists, and suggestions in purchasing books and furniture; 
 
-P-A-G-E-211
  LIBRARY EXTENSION IN THE UNITED STATES. 191 
libraries in 33 State correctional institutions were supervised; 74 
addresses made; 31 programs made out for clubs and 28 for study 
classes and granges; book lists furnished to 47 clubs and 31 granges; 
bulletins, pictures, and exhibits loaned to supplement books on 
various subjects; 2,545 volumes were purchased and 200 received 
as gifts. 
Of the 237 traveling libraries, 153 are in rural districts, being 
under the charge of the granges, farmers’ clubs, agricultural societies, 
and farming communities; 27 of them are in use by libraries with 
incomes too small to supply the towns with books without this help; 
and the remainder are stationed in small communities, only three of 
which are towns of over 3,000 inhabitants. 
The funds available have not permitted a greater enlargement of 
the scope of the traveling library work. There have been many more 
requests than could be filled, new stations being made only where the 
need seemed urgent. At the close of 1910 there were still over 600 
small communities in the State absolutely without library facilities. 
Besides the regular work of the traveling libraries, individual loans 
- have been made to meet the need of books for study. During 1910, 
1,113 volumes were circulated in this way. 
The New Jersey Federation of Women’s Clubs sent out in 1910 
17 boxes and barrels of books to traveling library stations and small 
communities, besides giving books directly to the commission. It 
also paid for the services of a librarian who served seven stations. 
To further the work in rural districts, the commission is cooperating 
with the State department of agriculture. Arrangements have been 
made for talks by a representative of the commission before farmers’ 
institutes in 16 different districts upon books for farmers. 
From 1907 to 1910 there was held, under direction of the commission, 
an annual summer school of elementary library science, which in 1911 
was replaced by a week’s institute for advanced work. 
Members of commission: W. C. Kimball, chairman, Passaic; M. 
Taylor Pyne, Princeton; E. C. Richardson, Princeton; Howard M. 
Cooper, Camden; Everett T. Tomlinson, Elizabeth. Secretary, 
Henry C. Buchanan, Trenton. 
NEW YORK. 
The regents of the University of the State of New York are em- 
powered by law to incorporate, aid, and supervise public libraries, 
and, in general, to ‘‘extend to the people at large increased educa- 
tional opportunities and facilities.”” They employ as their official 
agency for carrying on these operations, under the supervision of the 
director of the State library, the division of educational extension 
of the State education department. The following are the important 
lines of activity:  
-P-A-G-E-212
    192 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
1. To promote the establishment and operation of good public 
libraries. This is the particular duty of the chief of the division, 
the inspector, and the two library organizers. After preliminary 
correspondence, communities proposing to establish public libraries 
are visited and assistance rendered in organization and incorpora- 
tion. It is expected that each library, new or old, shall receive an 
official visit each year. The organizers, who are librarians of expe- 
rience, are each prepared to spend as much as two weeks in any place 
where their aid is needed by a new or small library. The service 
is rendered without cost to the libraries, except that, when an or- 
ganizer remains more than one day in a place, the local expense of 
her stay is borne by the aided library. Printed lists of approved 
books are prepared and furnished at frequent intervals, and aid is 
given in preparing plans for library buildings. There were, at the 
close of the year 1909-10, 462 libraries, including branches, connected 
with the division by incorporation or registry, or both. 
2. To distribute public library money. The State appropriation 
in aid of free libraries has reached the sum of $30,000 a year.. Under 
the present rule a library or branch library may receive not more 
than $100 from the State in any fiscal year, and this with an equal 
sum from local sources is used in buying approved books. 
3. To receive and compile annual reports from all libraries in the 
State. For the year ending July 31, 1910, reports were received 
from 1,345 libraries, containing 10,094,246 volumes, of which 137,021 
were added during the year. The free circulating libraries of the 
State, numbering 710, had 4,341,103 volumes and circulated 19,- 
254,729 in the year, or at the rate of 2,387 for each 1,000 of popula- 
tion. In 1893, when the extension work of the State began, the 
rate of free circulation was 352 to each 1,000 persons, showing a 
sixfold proportional increase in 17 years. 
4. To administer the State system of traveling libraries. This 
involves selecting, buying, cataloguing, and handling thousands of 
books every year, and, in connection with the registry of study clubs 
and assistance rendered in that direction, requires the constant 
service of 11 persons. There is now, in 1911, a collection of 45,000 
volumes available for traveling libraries. There are 65 regular 
fixed collections of 25, 50, or 100 volumes each for general reading. 
Five sets of each library have been provided and some have been 
duplicated ten times. 
The great bulk of the collection, however, consists of books which 
are subject to selection for reading on some particular topic. The 
traveling libraries are sent to groups of people on petition of five 
taxpayers in each case, to public libraries, to schools, to granges, 
and like organizations, and especially to registered study clubs.
-P-A-G-E-213
    
LIBRARY EXTENSION IN THE UNITED STATES. 193 
House libraries of 10 volumes each are also sent to responsible 
borrowers. Bookcases and printed lists of the fixed libraries are 
furnished, and a small fee is charged to cover the cost of transporta- 
tion.. During 1909-10, 819 traveling libraries, containing 45,142 
volumes, were loaned. 
5. To promote the establishment of study clubs. Any five or 
more persons within the State agreeing to follow a certain course of 
study for not less than 10 meetings, covering a period of not less 
than ten weeks, may apply to the division for registry, and when 
their course is approved they are as a study club entitled to such aid 
in the preparation of their program as the office can .render, and 
to the loan of books relating to the subject of their study. If any 
of the books needed are not already on hand, they may be bought for 
this use. The books are lent on the same terms as traveling libra- 
ries containing an equal number of volumes, and are for the exclusive 
use of the members of the study club while in their charge. Since 
this work began 1,000 such study clubs have been registered. 
6. To cooperate with the New York Library Association in holding 
library institutes and library round table meetings. The library 
round table movement is a systematic effort to bring together once 
a year small groups of librarians and library trustees in a very informal 
way for mutual acquaintance and profit. Every library is invited 
to join some convenient group. Topics for discussion are proposed 
or selected, and a special visitor or conductor is assigned for each 
meeting. The sessions are short, but opportunity is given for a full 
and frank interchange of views and for stating the results of expe- 
rience. The sixth annual series of these round table meetings was 
held from April 20 to June 9, 1911. The series consisted of 30 meet- 
ings, with a total attendance of 760 persons, representing 302 libra- 
ries, which was somewhat less than in 1910, but shows a gain of 
about 50 libraries over any other preceding year. 
The New York State Library has a well-developed legislative refer- 
ence section, which renders excellent service. 
The disastrous fire of March 29, 1911, compelled a suspension of 
many of the public activities of the State library until the occupancy 
of the new Educational Building, which is expected to be ready, in 
part at least, early in 1912. Other lines of work have been con- 
tinued with more or less interruption. Between 40,000 and 50,000 
volumes belonging to the traveling library system were out in the 
| State at the time of the fire, and are available for further circulation. 
The entire library is being restored as rapidly as circumstances permit. 
The recently organized library section of the New York State 
Teachers Association held its first meeting at Rochester, December 
28, 1910, in connection with the sixty-fifth annual meeting of the 
13144°—rp 1911—voL, 1——13  
-P-A-G-E-214
    
194 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
parent association. The program was interesting, and the attend- 
ance large. One of the most important and helpful features of the 
meeting was a comprehensive and carefully arranged exhibit of 
school library aids, methods, and supplies. A similar program and 
exhibit is announced for the meeting at Albany in November, 1911. 
The New York Legislature of 1911 authorized the establishment 
by popular vote of a county library system, or securing library privi- 
leges for the people of a whole county by means of a contract be- 
tween the county board of supervisors and any public library in the 
county. Previously there was no provision for action as a unit 
by a county in library matters, and the outcome of this new enact- 
ment is awaited with interest. 
NORTH CAROLINA. 
The North Carolina library commission was established by the 
general assembly of 1909, and active work was begun September 15 
of the same year. The commission consists of five members, two of 
whom are appointed by the North Carolina Library Association and 
one by the governor; the State librarian and the superintendent of 
public instruction are members ex officio. At present the members 
are Louis R. Wilson, librarian University of North Carolina, chair- 
man; Mrs. Sol Weil, vice chairman, Goldsboro; Dr. Charles Lee 
Smith, treasurer, Raleigh; J. Y. Joyner, superintendent of public 
instruction; Miles O. Sherrill, State librarian. Executive officer, 
Minnie W. Leatherman, secretary, Raleigh. 
The commission aids in organizing new libraries and in improving 
those already organized; it gives advice and assistance to all libraries 
in the State and to all communities which may propose to establish 
libraries as to the selection of books, cataloguing, maintenance, and 
other details of library management; and it maintains a periodical 
exchange and a clearing house for State reports. The commission 
is authorized to establish and maintain a system of traveling libraries, 
but owing to lack of State financial support this work has so far been 
obliged to depend upon donations of books and money from the 
library extension department of the Federation of Women’s Clubs, 
and from individuals. The commission requests from the legislature 
an annual appropriation of $2,500 for the establishment and operation 
of traveling libraries. 
In addition to the instruction given in its office and on personal 
visits, the commission conducts a summer school for library training, 
lasting six weeks, as a regular department of the University of North 
Carolina summer school, and in connection with the university 
library. The course includes use of libraries for students, and tech- 
nical branches for librarians and for teachers in charge of school 
libraries.
-P-A-G-E-215
  
LIBRARY EXTENSION IN THE UNITED STATES. 195 
The commission has established a close connection with the schools 
by giving advice regarding the care and use of school libraries, and 
help in the selection of books. A bulletin on school libraries, pre- 
pared by the secretary of the commission, was published and dis- 
tributed by the superintendent of public instruction to all school 
libraries in the State. Other literature on the subject has been dis- 
tributed by the commission, and talks have been given at teachers’ 
meetings to arouse the interest of superintendents and teachers in 
building up good school libraries. 
The general assembly of 1911 passed a public library law, pro- 
viding that upon the petition of 25 per cent of the registered voters 
of a city or town the question of the establishment of a free public 
library shall be submitted to the voters. It provides also for the 
maintenance of the library when established, by means of special 
taxation, and for its government by a board of trustees. At the time 
of the passage of the act only 12 towns in North Carolina had free 
public libraries. Within 62 counties in the State there were no public 
libraries, and 15 counties had only one library each. A movement 
largely to increase this number is now in progress. 
To carry on its work the commission receives an annual appropria- 
tion of $1,500. Of this amount $1,000 is spent for salaries, leaving 
but $500 yearly for traveling expenses of the members of the com- 
mission and of the secretary, for office equipment and supplies, for 
the publication of the bulletin and similar activities, for traveling 
libraries, for printing, and for miscellaneous expenses, With such 
limited means the work of the commission is necessarily restricted. 
The State library has been thoroughly reorganized under the direct 
supervision of the secretary of the commission, which has also sup- 
plied reorganizers for two North Carolina college libraries. 
NORTH DAKOTA. 
The legislature of 1907 created a public library commission con- 
sisting of three members—the president of the North Dakota Library 
Association and the superintendent of public instruction ex officio 
and one member to be appointed by the governor. The legislature 
of 1909 added two members to the commission, the secretary of the 
State Historical Society ex officio and one member to be appointed 
by the governor. 
It is the duty of the commission to circulate traveling libraries, to 
give advice and instruction upon any matter pertaining to the organ- 
ization, maintenance, or administration of libraries, to encourage 
the formation of libraries where none exist, to keep statistics of the 
free public libraries of North Dakota, and to maintain an educa- 
tional reference library and a legislative reference bureau.
-P-A-G-E-216
  196 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
The system of traveling libraries formerly circulated by the State 
superintendent of public instruction is now in the care of the library 
commission. These libraries consist of fixed groups of 40 or 50 books 
for general reading and study by adults and children, and are sent 
for six months to communities, libraries, schools, colleges, study 
clubs, and literary associations, free of cost except for transportation, 
upon application bearing six signatures. 
In addition to the general traveling library system, there have 
recently been put in circulation six series especially for farmers, each 
containing 12 to 15 technical books on agriculture, which are sent 
on application of three farmers who agree to circulate them in their 
vicinity. 
From the general loan collection of about 3,000 books on special 
subjects, study clubs, teachers, schools, debating societies, and indi- 
viduals may borrow books free of cost, except for payment of trans- 
portation both ways. 
Notable progress in library development has been made in North 
Dakota since the organization of the commission, as shown by the 
following statistics:

The active organization of a legislative reference department was 
begun in 1908, and the work of collecting data on political, legal, 
and economic questions has been vigorously continued ever since. 
The department furnishes information and assistance to members of 
the legislature, State officials, and citizens; loans debate material, 
and has published bulletins on permanent State tax commissions 
and on good roads. 
The commission is requesting additional funds from the legislature 
for the purchase of books. July 1, 1911, 24 stations were asking the 
immediate loan of traveling libraries, and there were no books in the 
office to supply the demand.

OHIO. 
Library extension work in this State is in charge of a board of 
library commissioners, established in 1896, which also supervises the 
State library and names its librarian. That institution is not only 
a reference library for State officials and members of the general 
assembly, but also the free public library of the entire State. 
The commission is by law authorized to give advice in relation to 
the miaintenance and administration of public libraries. This 
authority has been liberally interpreted and substantial assistance 
has been given to those seeking such aid. Provision is now made also 
for the employment of a library organizer, who devotes her time 
largely to field work. 
The traveling library is administered as a department of the State 
library, and the so-called “flexible” system, as distinguished from 
‘fixed collections,’ has been in use from the beginning. Collections 
varying in number of volumes are sent to women’s clubs, schools, 
granges, public libraries, independent study clubs, religious organiza- 
tions, men’s clubs, and similar organizations. These are loaned for 
three months, with privilege of renewal, transportation both ways 
being paid by the borrowers. The traveling library department also 
issues small collections of books on agriculture, not exceeding eight 
volumes each, to individual patrons, and other books are loaned to 
individuals for a period of four weeks. 
The Ohio library organizer reported for the past year in September, 
1911, that— 
in addition to meeting special requests for aid, efforts have been made to visit libraries 
in the State, encourage keeping proper records, to install standard charging systems, 
to classify libraries needing help, assist in cataloguing, stimulate use of libraries, hold 
district meetings, develop extension and encourage library training courses, to study 
conditions in the State institutions, and to issue a series of bulletins. The exchange 
of periodicals has been furthered by making a list of libraries wishing to exchange 
duplicates and an outline explaining the method of exchange, and mailing them to 
libraries interested. Traveling libraries have been in demand, and the question of 
county libraries is being actively considered. Thirty communities have taken advan- 
tage of the provision for township libraries. Sixteen district library meetings have 
been held and have been most beneficial. Addresses on library extension have also 
been given at the teachers’ institutes. 
There are now in Ohio a total of 137 tax-supported libraries, but 
13 counties in the State are still without a single institution of the 
kind. 
The general assembly in 1910 enacted a law authorizing the board 
of library commissioners to establish, in connection with the Ohio 
State library, a “legislative reference and information department,” 
and appropriated $3,000 for its support. The work of the new 
department has been inaugurated, and it is planned to make it of 
general service throughout the State.

The Ohio board of library commissioners consists of J. F. McGrew, 
Springfield; John McSweeney, Wooster; and Frank N. Sweitzer, 
Canton. Its secretary is John H. Newman, State librarian. 
OREGON. 
The Oregon library commission was created by an act of the 
legislature of 1905 to— 
give advice to all schools, free and other public libraries, and to all communities 
which may propose to establish them, as to the best means of establishing and main- 
taining such libraries, the selection of books, cataloguing, and other details of library 
management. It may also purchase and operate traveling libraries within the State 
among communities, libraries, schools, colleges, universities, library associations, 
study clubs, charitable and penal institutions, free of cost, except for transportation, 
under such conditions and rules as shall protect the interest of the State and best 
increase the efficiency of the-service it is expected to render the public. It may 
publish such lists and circulars of information as it shall deem necessary, and it may 
also conduct a summer school of library instruction and a clearing house for periodicals 
for free gift to local libraries. 
By the school library law of 1905, the additional duty was imposed 
of acting as purchasing agent annually for all school districts in the 
State, outside of Multnomah County, in which is the city of Port- 
_land. The members are prohibited by law from receiving payment 
for their services. 
The main divisions of activity of the commission are traveling 
library work, school work, reference work, and public libraries. 
Its latest report tells what was done during 1909-10 toward col- 
lecting books, and how these books have been sent throughout the 
State by post, freight, express, and team, until they have reached a 
total circulation during this time of over 45,000 loans for general 
reading, and 9,000 pamphlets and periodical articles for the study of 
particular subjects. The total number of loans recorded since the be- 
ginning of the commission is 74,490, with probably 223,470 readers for 
traveling libraries alone. These statistics have significance in so far 
as any educational work may be measured by figures, proving con- 
clusively that there is a demand for a central lending library in the 
State. "The commission library now contains 12,095 books, 9,574 of 
which, are in traveling libraries and the general loan collection, 1,421 
in the model school library, and 1,100 in the reference collection. 
Very few of these books are shelved in the commission rooms, but 
they are deposited in the 103 branch libraries, or stations, in the 
State. 
The 9,574 volumes in the general lending collection may be found 
on the shelves of schoolhouses, grange halls, general stores, and ‘ 
small town libraries in over 100 places in the State; the books in the 
model school library are being read aloud in district schools in nearly 
every county; the reference collection upon public questions is in
-P-A-G-E-219
  
LIBRARY EXTENSION IN THE UNITED STATES. 199 
the hands of debaters in many rural and high schools; the profes- 
- sional books for teachers are in the country schools of six counties. 
Country schools in every county receive from the commission sheets 
of holiday material, for use in school entertainments. Many granges 
secure envelopes of pamphlets and clippings for their educational 
program work upon public questions, as well as upon agricultural 
topics, and women’s clubs in three counties meet to discuss pro- 
gram topics from commission study collections. 
The general loan collection of books owned by the commission has 
not grown as many libraries have grown, but books upon special sub- 
jects have been bought to meet definite needs, or to encourage study 
of some subject which is of first importance to Oregonians. For 
instance, since it was thought the standard of efficiency among 
teachers of country schools would be raised if they might have an 
opportunity to read and study a few books which are most inspira- 
tional and helpful for them, several selected books were bought in 
quantities and distributed among rural schools, with gratifying 
results. When the United States Bureau of Education published its 
100-volume list entitled ‘A teacher’s professional library” (Bul- 
letin, 1909, No. 8), the commission bought these books, and ad- 
vertised them through the school journals and the county sup-- 
erintendents. 
The total amount of orders sent’ to the State contractor since the 
school library law went into effect in 1905 is $76,056.82; the number 
of volumes distributed is about 135,000. The commission judges 
that two things are now necessary in order to make the school 
library law accomplish its purpose, namely, supervision by the 
commission of school libraries and of school library work through a 
trained field inspector and facilities for thorough normal school 
training in the use and care of books and libraries. 
The members of the Oregon library commission are F. W. Benson, 
governor; L. R. Alderman, State superintendent of public instruc- 
tion; P. L. Campbell, president of University of Oregon; Mary F. 
Isom, librarian of Portland library; W. B. Ayer, Portland. The 
secretary is Cornelia Marvin, Salem. 
At the session of the legislature for 1911 the following library 
laws were enacted: 
1. Providing that any county containing a population of 50,000 
inhabitants, or more, may levy a tax not to exceed 14 mills for a public 
library building fund, and the tax may be divided and levied in two 
successive years. The building shall be erected at the county seat. 
This act would at present apply only to Multnomah County, in 
which the city of Portland is located. 
2. Amending the county library law by striking out the popula- 
tion limit, which had previously made it apply to Multnomah County 
 
-P-A-G-E-220
  200 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
only, and by raising the maintenance tax from one-fifth to one-half 
of 1 mill. It is not probable that any other county in the State ~ 
will for some years take advantage of this law, as the counties are 
large and thinly populated, but Oregon now has an excellent county 
library law ready for use whenever the conditions make it desirable. 
3. Increasing the annual appropriation for the library commission 
from $6,000 to $9,000. 
4. Making the State treasurer custodian of the private funds of 
the commission, these funds being considerable, as it handles all the 
school library money of the State. 
5. Providing that county courts may appropriate $200 from the 
general fund of the county for the purpose of establishing farm 
libraries at various points in the counties, in connection with estab- 
lished libraries, commercial clubs, or other public institutions; the 
list of books from which selections are made to be approved by the 
Oregon Agricultural College. 
6. Appropriating $175,000 for constructing and furnishing a 
modern fireproof library and museum building for the University 
of Oregon; $15,000 was allowed for books, magazines, and binding 
for the Oregon Agricultural College for the biennial period. 
There is a movement to call the referendum upon the last two 
measures, and they have been included in a list of bills for which a 
referendum petition is being circulated. As no bill without an 
emergency clause becomes a law in Oregon until 90 days after the 
adjournment of the legislature, there is considerable uncertainty 
about the final inclusion of acts in the statutes. 
PENNSYLVANIA. 
The Pennsylvania free library commission, established in 1899, 
has as its work the supervision and encouragement of the free library 
movement throughout the State, and the maintenance of a system 
ef traveling libraries. 
The first-named group of duties includes the initial effort to pro- 
mote library work in a new center, followed by advice and personal 
assistance in organization and administration. New libraries are 
visited often and a special effort is made to maintain close relations 
during the formative period. All free libraries in the State are 
visited by a member of the commission staff to give counsel on any 
subjects affecting their welfare. 
The traveling libraries are designed to encourage the establishment 
of permanent libraries wherever possible, and to provide books for 
localities which can not support libraries of their own. To this end 
the service is organized as follows: 
1. Collections of 50 books for general reading, designed to provide 
free libraries for communities in which there is no such institution. 
 
-P-A-G-E-221
  
LIBRARY EXTENSION IN THE UNITED STATES. 201 
These are loaned for six months upon application of 12 taxpayers 
and payment of a fee of $1 to cover cost of transportation both ways. 
2. Groups on special subjects for reading circles and study clubs, 
which are invited to send their programs to the commission for the 
collection of libraries covering the appropriate subjects. The num- 
ber of volumes varies, but an effort is made to include all books neces- 
sary for the proper study of the subjects. These libraries are loaned 
“upon application of the officers of the club, for a fee of $1 to cover 
transportation, and may be kept until the close of the season’s work. 
3. Collections are provided for use in the schools throughout the 
State. These libraries each include 50 volumes, chosen to suit the 
grade for which they are intended, and designed to arouse interest 
in school work, as well as to lead the young people to an appreciation 
of the better class of literature. They are loaned upon application 
of the officers of the school board for a fee of $1, and may be kept 
until the close of the school year. 
4. Books are loaned to individuals who are interested in some 
particular line of study but are so situated that they can not secure 
the books needed. These collections include not more than five 
works, which may be kept three months. The applicant must be 
indorsed by a real-estate owner and pay all transportation charges. 
The Pennsylvania free library commission is composed of Henry R. 
Edmunds, chairman, and John Thomson, treasurer, Philadelphia; 
Thomas L. Montgomery, State librarian, secretary; Harrison W. 
Craver, Pittsburgh; Henry Belin, jr., Scranton; Horace E. Hayden, 
Wilkes-Barre. 
The new school code of Pennsylvania, passed May, 1911, makes 
provision for the establishment and maintenance of public-school 
libraries in school districts having less than 500,000 population. 
Each such library is to be under the management and supervision of 
the board ot school directors of the district, or of a board of seven 
library trustees, as the directors may determine. The board of 
school directors in any school district within the population limit 
may annually appropriate for the support of any public-school 
library in its district, out of its annual school taxes, such sums as it 
may deem proper, not exceeding 1 mill on the dollar of total valua- 
tion of taxable property in the district. Provided, that when a 
library is first established, the board of school directors may provide 
for the building and establishment of such public library, or may 
provide for the enlargement of any library, in like manner as any 
public-school building may be built or enlarged. Instead of estab- 
lishing or maintaining a separate public-school library, any board of 
school directors may, by a two-thirds vote, join with, or aid, any 
individual or association in the maintenance, or the establishment 
and maintenance, of a free, public, nonsectarian library, under such
-P-A-G-E-222
    202 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911 
written agreement as it may determine. The board of school direc- 
tors, or the library trustees with the consent of the board of school 
directors, may circulate part or all of the books and other collections 
of a public-school library among the several schools, or may estab- 
lish branch libraries. Two or more school districts may unite in the 
establishment or maintenance of a joint public-school library. The 
provisions of the law being retroactive and affecting all libraries 
previously supported by school boards, all existing organizations 
ceased on the first Monday of July, 1911, and were replaced by the 
new order. 
     
       
                          
    
    
    
     
        
    RHODE ISLAND. 
In this State free public libraries, as well as public schcols, are 
under the general supervision of the State board of education. The 
State committee on libraries, composed of three members of the 
board of education, performs the duties assigned in some States to a 
public-library commission. The committee apportions annual 
State aid to all free public libraries, and in connection therewith 
requires thorough reports from librarians. All lists of books pur- 
chased with State money must have the approval of the committee, 
which also promotes the organization of new libraries, gives advice 
and assistance to librarians, maintains a system of traveling libraries, 
and issues various publications. The legislature of 1911 increased 
the annual appropriation for the visitation, examination, and man- 
agement of free public libraries by the State board of education from 
one to two thousand dollars. 
Rhode Island apportions annually $8,500 for the purchase of books 
among 57 free public libraries, in addition to an annual appropria- 
tion of $1,000 for traveling libraries. Aid is granted annually to 
each library as follows: Fifty dollars on the first 500 volumes in cir- 
culation; $25 for every additional 500 volumes; $200 being the 
maximum allowance to any one library. 
The system of traveling libraries, which was established by legis- 
lative enactment in 1907, includes: (1) Traveling libraries circu- 
lated by the committee; (2) traveling or branch libraries distributed 
to schools with State aid by existing libraries; and (3) traveling 
libraries maintained and circulated with State aid by associations. 
There are now 30 libraries of the first class, 19 of the second, an 
120 of the third, altogether numbering 9,193 volumes, with a circu 
lation for the year 1909-10 of 25,623 loans. More than half of thi 
appropriation for traveling libraries is expended as direct aid 
associations maintaining and circulating them. 
The members of the Rhode Island committee on libraries ar 
-Frank Hill, chairman, Ashaway; Frank E. Thompson, Newport 
and Samuel W. K. Allen, East Greenwich. Walter E. Ranger 
_ commissioner of public schools, is secretary.

TENNESSEE. 
The Tennessee free library commission was established by the 
legislature of 1909 and was organized March, 1910, at which time 
a general secretary was elected to take active charge. Its mem- 
bership is made up of three persons appointed by the governor, 
together with the State superintendent of public instruction and the 
State librarian ex officio. 
The act establishing the commission provides that— 
It shall be the duty of the commission hereby created to encourage and promote 
the establishment throughout the State of free public libraries, school libraries, trav- 
eling libraries, and other libraries, and aid in the organization and administration 
thereof, and in the administration of libraries already established in this State. For 
this purpose the commission, when opportunity offers, shall give information and 
advice to all communities in the State that propose establishing such libraries as to 
the best methods of establishment, organization, and administration; and, in the 
case of any library already established, shall, whenever requested by the librarian 
or board of directors or trustees thereof, furnish like assistance, information, and 
advice to such library. The commission is authorized to purchase and accept gifts 
of books, periodicals, and traveling libraries and circulate them in towns, villages, 
and farming and other communities where needed, it being the purpose of this pro- 
vision to make practicable in small communities, by temporary supplies thereof, 
such reading and study of good books and periodicals as is not practicable to persons 
who have not access to libraries. 
The legislature of 1911 appropriated the sum of $2,500 a year for 
two years for the salary of a secretary and State library organizer, 
stationery, printing, and other legitimate expenses of the commission. 
It was reported that during the summer of 1910 the general secre- 
tary of the commission attended several State teachers’ institutes, 
and gave lectures and conducted library classes with excellent 
results. Great interest was taken by the teachers, and the library 
spirit was notably developed. The plan was to continue and extend 
the movement so auspiciously inaugurated. 
The membership of the free library commission consists- of G. H. 
Baskette, president, Nashville; Mary Hannah Johnson, secretary, 
Nashville; Mrs. W. D. Beard, treasurer, Memphis; J. W. Brister, 
State superintendent of public instruction; Mary R. Skeffington, 
State librarian. 
The general education bill of 1909 set aside 25 per cent of the 
gross revenue of Tennessee for school purposes. One per cent of 
the fund derived from this appropriation is used tc encourage and 
assist in the establishment and maintenance of libraries for the 
public schools, as provided below: 
Whenever the patrons and friends of any public school in any county of the State 
shall raise by private subscription or otherwise, and tender to the county trustee, 
through the county superintendent of public instruction, the sum of $20 or more 
for the establishment and maintenance of a library for that school, said county super- 
intendent shall notify the state superintendent of public instruction, and, upon  
-P-A-G-E-224
    
204 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
the certificate of the state superintendent of public instruction, the comptroller 
of the treasury shall pay to the trustee of said county, out of the fund herein pro- 
vided, a sum equal to half that raised by private subscription or otherwise, to be 
added to the library fund of said school; and whenever $10 or more shall be raised 
by private subscription or otherwise to supplement a library already established 
under the provisions of this section of this act, said library may in like manner receive 
from the fund herein provided a sum equal to half the sum so raised. 
Provided, That no school shall receive in any one year from this fund more than 
$20 for the establishment of a new library, or more than $10 to assist in supplementing 
a library already established. 
Since the passage of this act more than 600 schools have availed 
themselves of the opportunity to secure libraries, but the depart- 
ment of public instruction has not been able to use all the funds 
available for this purpose on account of lack of interest on the part 
of many teachers. It is not only ready, but anxious, to distribute 
this money among the various counties, and since there is on hand 
an amount sufficient to meet all demands, school-teachers all over 
the State are urged. to inaugurate some movement in their localities 
to secure a part of the fund. 
Through the general education bill of 1909, the State library 
receives for traveling libraries for county schools one-fifth of the 1 
per cent accruing for library purposes from the 25 per cent of the 
gross receipts of the State. At present 3,600 volumes are in circula- 
tion by this system, and new collections, which will soon be available 
for use, are in preparation. The legislative act places these circu- 
lating libraries under the joint direction of the State library and the 
department of public instruction. 
The State library announces a twofold object in sending traveling 
libraries to the county schools—first, to make of the boys and girls of 
to-day the reading men and women of to-morrow; second, to reach 
the patrons through the pupils. The books of the libraries are car- 
ried into the homes of the pupils, and are read both by them and by 
adult members of the family, thus arousing a desire for permanent 
libraries. For example, the Anderson County News, of November, 
1911, says that a library of 50 volumes in the Briceville school was 
read by over 300 pupils and patrons in less than a month’s time. 
The scheme by which these libraries are operated is both simple 
and comprehensive. On application of the county superintendent, 
the State library will send to each county one or two sets of traveling 
libraries, containing six libraries to a set and 50 volumes to a library. 
These libraries are made up of primary, intermediate, grammar, and 
high-school books, with a few additional volumes on agriculture and 
related subjects. The county superintendent distributes these 
libraries through his county schools, the teacher in charge of each 
school becoming librarian. The State library holds the county 
superintendent responsible for the circulation of the libraries, and the 
county superintendent holds his teachers responsible for the circula-
-P-A-G-E-225
  LIBRARY EXTENSION IN THE UNITED STATES. 205 
tion of the books after the libraries reach the schools. One set of 
libraries remains in a county for one school year, then goes to another 
county, and a new set takes its place. There is no charge for these 
libraries, the State library furnishing the books, cases, and paying 
transportation. : 
The Carnegie Public Library of Nashville systematically circulates 
a large number of its books, for supplemental and parallel reading, 
in the white public schools and the night schools in the city. These 
books, carefully selected by the librarian and a committee of teachers, 
provide a graded literature of the best character, especially adapted 
to the kinds and courses of study in the schools. The books are 
neatly packed in locked boxes made for the purpose, each box con- 
taining the volumes designed for a particular school and arranged 
to suit the requirements of each of the grammar grades. The boxes 
with the books are sent to the schools at the beginning of the term, 
and are returned to the library at the end of each quarter to be 
examined, and are then redistributed among the schools, so that at 
every distribution each school shall receive a change of titles. It is 
estimated that each book is read on an average of eight times a year. 
It is hoped that other communities in the State may be impelled to 
emulate Nashville in the provision of school libraries. 
TEXAS. 
The act creating the Texas library and historical commission 
became effective March 19, 1909. It provides for a commission com- 
posed of three members appointed by the governor, and two ex 
officio members—the professor of history in the University of Texas 
and the superintendent of public instruction. The present member- , 
ship comprises Eugene C. Barker, chairman; Mrs. Joseph B. Dibrell, 
Mrs. Joseph D. Sayers, Walter Tips, and F. M. Bralley. E. W. 
Winkler, State librarian, is ex officio secretary of the commission. 
The duties of the library and historical commission, as prescribed 
by law, may be summarized as follows: (1) To control and administer 
the State library; (2) to encourage historical work and research; (3) 
to collect, classify, and publish the historical archives; (4) to aid 
those studying the problems to be dealt with by legislation; (5) to 
aid and encourage libraries; and (6) to conduct library institutes. 
This comprehensive statute combines several different forms of 
State library work under one administrative board. Owing to lack of 
funds, some of the lines of activity marked out for the commission 
have not yet been touched. The law presents the specifications 
of the great and useful work that the commission, when it has the 
funds, is to develop. An effective beginning has already been made 
toward the development of a legislative reference department, and 
in various other directions.

eg a a a eT a eS aes a et a ea Gt 
206 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
The powers of the Texas Library and Historical Commission in 
regard to library extension are broad and generous in their intent: 
The commission shall give advice to such persons as contemplate the establishment 
of public libraries in regard to such matters as the maintenance of public libraries, 
selection of books, cataloguing, and library management. The commission shall 
have conducted library institutes and encourage library associations. ‘The State libra- 
rian shall ascertain the condition of all public libraries in this State and report the 
results to the commission. 
The appropriation allowed for this branch of the commission’s 
work placed very decided bounds to the extent of its activities. The 
work has been limited almost entirely to what could be done by 
correspondence, of which there has been a large amount. With the 
small funds at its command, the commission has been unable to hold 
special library meetings, but has, however, had representation on 
the programs of such bodies as the Texas Library Association and the 
State Federation of Women’s Clubs. 
The growth of public-school libraries in Texas during the past 
decade has been remarkable. An increase in 10 years in the number 
of these libraries from 450 to 1,978, and an increase in the number of 
volumes contained in them from 90,335 to 267,679, show a tendency 
in the right direction. However, in view of the fact that in 1909-10 
there were in Texas 949,006 children of school age distributed among 
11,668 schools, the extension of library facilities for these pupils may 
well be continued, and for this purpose encouragement and direction 
from a central authority would be of advantage. 
At the time of the last report of the State librarian, August 31, 1910, 
there were 30 free public libraries operating in Texas, while 4 others 
had their buildings complete and were expected to open in a few 
months. Several public subscription libraries were also in existence. 
A library building costing $15,000 had been erected at the Southwest 
Texas State Normal School, and the fine building for the University 
of Texas library was under construction. Campaigns for free public 
libraries were in progress in a number of cities. 
The history of free public libraries in Texas dates back only 10 or 
12 years. Remarkable progress has been made during this brief 
period by the libraries in the large cities. The success of the public 
library in the smaller cities has been varied. Where the financial 
support has been at all adequate, and the administration in compe- 
tent hands, they have done excellent work, but this support has not 
always been furnished. If the commission had the means to send out . 
a field organizer, he could be of assistance in cases where favorable 
sentiment needs to be aroused, and also in new enterprises already 
under way. 
The legislature in extra session, August, 1911, passed an appropria- 
tion bill which included $11,478 for maintenance of the commission 
during 1911-12, and $10,378 for the same purpose during 1912-13,  
-P-A-G-E-227
  
LIBRARY EXTENSION IN THE UNITED STATES. 207 
but through vetoes of various items by the governor these amounts 
have been reduced to $10,178 and $7,078, respectively. 
The University of Texas announces that it is prepared, through its 
public discussion and information division, to furnish specific aid to 
the citizens of the State in the discussion of important public ques- 
tions. This aid the university will attempt to supply, as far as its 
resources permit, by means of traveling libraries accompanied by 
specific references to the books and articles contained therein, and 
by additional references for more extensive reading. It is hoped 
that such traveling libraries and such lists of books and articles will 
be of service to members of debating clubs, women’s clubs, and labor 
unions, and to public officials and others. 
At the present time the university has available for circulation 
traveling libraries and lists of books relating to the following topics: 
Penitentiary reform, liquor problem, municipal ownership of public 
utilities, city government by commission, compulsory education, 
and books suitable for. use by mothers’ clubs. 
Upon request these traveling libraries will be loaned free of charge 
for a period of three weeks, with privilege of renewal, to citizens of 
Texas who are willing to pay the express charges upon them both 
ways. 
UTAH. 
After two years of library promotion conducted by a public- 
spirited unofficial commission, the Utah Legislature of 1909 estab- 
lished a State library gymnasium commission of five members, to be 
appointed by the State board of education, and to be under its 
general supervision. Its purpose was ‘‘to: increase and improve 
educational advantages of the State by establishing and maintaining 
free libraries and gymnasiums.’’ The special feature of the work in 
Utah is the promotion of the public gymnasium with the library, thus 
affording facilities for healthful development of both mind and body. 
At the same session of the legislature, it was made obligatory upon 
school boards outside of the larger cities to spend for school libraries 
15 cents per capita annually for each child of school age. 
Upon recommendation of the governor, in the interest of economy, 
the legislature in 1911 repealed the act establishing the commission 
and transferred its duties to the State board of education, as follows: 
The State board of education shall also promote the establishment of libraries and 
gymnasiums throughout the State, and shall have power to appoint a secretary, who 
shall work under the direction of the State superintendent of public instruction. The 
salary of the secretary shall be fixed by the State board of education and approved 
by the State board of examiners. The board shall have the power to call to its 
assistance expert help to promote libraries and gymnasiums whenever needed. The 
actual and necessary traveling expenses incurred by such help, and the salary of the 
secretary, shall be paid from the contingent fund of the State board of education upon 
the presentation of properly certified and approved vouchers.  
-P-A-G-E-228
  208 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
At the legislative session of 1911, also, it was enacted that in cities 
of the third class and incorporated towns, an election to determine 
the establishment of a free public library or library and gymnasium 
shall be called upon petition of 10 per cent (instead of 50 per cent, as 
previously required) of the legal voters. The maximum tax for a 
free public library was raised to 3 mills from 1 mill; the maximum 
tax for a free public library and public gymnasium was made 4 mills 
instead of 2. Such cities and towns may now cooperate with school 
districts to maintain free public libraries. 
Much has been accomplished since the beginning of the library 
movement in this State. Four years ago there were only three pub- 
lic libraries in Utah; now there are 15 in active operation. Besides 
this, a dozen more cities at least are reported to be well on the way 
to the establishment of public libraries. 
The school library cause, also, has been greatly advanced. When 
this movement was inaugurated, very few schools in the State had 
any collection of books, and almost none had-a collection worthy of 
the name of library. To-day the majority have a good beginning 
toward an effective school library, and a considerable number of 
schools have libraries regularly opened to the public. 
VERMONT. 
Vermont has a board of library commissioners with the following 
functions and aims: 
Functions: To furnish material aid by gifts of books for establishing 
libraries or for subsidizing small libraries, and by loan of traveling 
libraries to individuals, clubs, schools, and libraries. To give advice 
and instruction in all subjects relating to the establishment, mainte- 
nance, and administration of libraries, by means of correspondence, 
by the personal visit of a library expert, by institutes for the free 
instruction of librarians, by printed book lists and discussions of library 
problems. To furnish inspiration by public meetings which empha- 
size the dignity and scope of the work, by meetings of librarians and 
trustees which promote inter-library exchanges and broader interest, 
by the Bulletin—a periodical devoted to the library interests of the 
State. 
Aims: To supply Vermonters with material for wholesome and 
uplifting diversion ; to give opportunity of continuous public education; 
to furnish means of a broader culture. 
The general assembly, at its 1908 session, adopted legislation con- 
ferring larger powers and imposing new duties upon the board, and at 
the same time granted increased appropriations. The most important 
amendment made to the library law was that which authorized 
the board to assist those libraries in the smaller towns that render 
useful assistance to the country schools and districts remote from the
-P-A-G-E-229

library. For this purpose an annual appropriation of $1,000 was 
placed at the disposal of the board. This enabled it during the year 
from December 1, 1908, to December 1, 1909, to assist 38 towns with 
gifts of carefully selected collections of books, costing from $20 to $35 
dollars each. In arranging this work the board required a formal 
application and an assurance that work would be done beyond the 
usual routine; and at the end of the year a report was requested from 
each town that received such assistance in order that the board might 
know the value of this work and plan its future policy. Of the 38 
towns, 21 have done substantial work in the small country schools, 
and several have maintained branch or traveling libraries in their 
remote sections. 
The year 1910 brought 65 applications for annual aid, of which 22 
were from towns which did not apply the first year. Owing to the 
limited appropriation, the board was able to grant assistance to only 
45 of the number. 
The eighth biennial report of the commission for 1909-10 shows 
substantial progress during this period in the organization of libraries 
and the erection of buildings. Through the enterprise of public- 
spirited associations and private benevolence Vermont now has 72 
library buildings as memorials of the generosity of the donors, many of 
whom have left the State. During the term covered by the report 
large gifts or bequests for library purposes have been received by the 
towns of Bristol, Danville, Lunenburg, Newbury, Pittsford, Reading, 
St. Johnsbury, Strafford, Wilmington, and Windsor. 
New free public libraries have recently been established by vote 
of their town meetings in eight towns. These make 126 free public 
libraries, owned and controlled by towns, receiving State aid, and a 
total of 183 libraries in the State. 
Since 1908 the commission, sometimes in conjunction with the 
State Library Association, has held quarterly meetings at various 
towns in the State. To these not only librarians but educators and 
all interested in libraries and schools have been invited, and the inter- 
est and attendance have been very gratifying. The topics considered 
have been inspirational rather than technical, and cooperation with 
schools has been a central theme. Since school districts have been 
long abolished in Vermont and very few schools have libraries, the 
town library is the natural source of supply for the schools. 
Emphasis has also been placed on the establishment of branch libra- 
vies in towns so situated as to need them, and the circulation of tray- 
eling libraries in schools by the local library. An annual institute of 
instruction was held at the University of Vermont in July, 1908, at 
Middlebury College in July, 1909, and at the academy in St. Johns- 
bury in June, 1910, all of which were profitable and well attended.

  210 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
The session of a week was occupied by lessons in book mending and 
the principles of cataloguing and library methods. The course was 
entirely free. A section in the new law provides that the necessary 
expenses of a librarian in attendance at such school may be paid by 
the town, city, or incorporated village in which such librarian is 
employed. No institute was held in 1911, but it is officially an- 
nounced. that it has not been given up, but is undergoing a process 
of adaptation. The plan was to hold this year, instead of one central 
school, one or more smaller meetings of instruction less formal than 
an institute. In this way it was hoped to reach and teach those 
librarians who have never been able to come to the institute, and to 
offer equally good but more concrete instruction. 
Regarding traveling libraries, the report of the commission for 
1909-10 says: 
We are now completing 10 years’ experience with traveling libraries and report con- 
tinued and increasing demand for them in all departments. The use of the general 
libraries has nearly doubled. In some cases the stations have formed permanent 
libraries and so have dropped from the list of borrowers. Other stations have dropped 
out for other reasons, and new communities have been added to the list. A new growth 
has been in the direction of libraries on special subjects and school libraries. These 
have been limited only by the means at our command to supply them. We have 
feared to advertise school libraries very much this past year because we have not had 
enough libraries to meet the increasing demand. During the past two years we have 
added to our equipment 8 general libraries, 14 school libraries, 16 studying club collec- 
tions, and various sets of pictures. 
It is commonly found that when books are sent for the use of the 
school children the parents also become interested, and the result is 
an aid toward raising the people in general to a higher plane. 
The libraries average from 40 to 50 volumes each. The superin- 
tendent of the traveling library department, or the secretary of the 
commission, will upon request furnish an application blank, which 
is to be filled out and signed by three citizens, stating the name of the 
person who is to act as librarian and have charge of the correspond- 
ence regarding the library. It also contains an agreement to return 
the library within six months from its reception, to pay transporta- 
tion charges, and to make good any losses beyond reasonable wear. 
While the law requires the signatures of but three citizens, it is 
always desirable, in the view of the commission, that a larger number 
should be behind the movement. 
With each library is furnished a sufficient number of annotated 
lists of the books contained therein for all families in the commu- 
nity. These are designed to arouse interest and aid in making a 
selection of books desired. The expense of transportation of the 
books varies with the size of the library and the distance it must go, 
from 50 cents to $1.50. The express companies make a reduction 
of half the regular rate on the return.

The library commissioners are March M. Wilson, chairman, Ran- 
dolph; Mrs. C. M. Winslow, Brandon; Edward M. Goddard, Mont- 
pelier; Fanny B. Fletcher, Proctorsville; Caroline H. Clement, Rut- 
land. Miss R. W. Wright, Montpelier, is secretary of the board. 
The Vermont Legislature, at its session in 1911, established in the 
State library a legislative reference bureau, and appropriated $1,000 
annually for its maintenance. 
        
   
     
   
      
    
                              
    
   
   VIRGINIA. 
The Virginia State library performs many of the functions of a 
library commission, in that it has charge of the system of traveling 
libraries and endeavors in every way possible to advance library 
interests in the State. It also renders effective service in its legis- 
lative reference department. 
In 1906 the general assembly of the State appropriated $7,500 for 
the organization of a department of traveling libraries, and at its 
next session in 1908 made for the support of this department an 
appropriation of $1,800, which was renewed in 1910. With these 
limited means the service has been maintained and extended as far 
as possible. : 
The number of traveling library collections in November, 1910, was 
211—81 general collections for communities, 125 school collections, 
and 5 special collections. The demand from schools’ and com- 
munities for these libraries has long since exceeded the supply. Many 
testimonials received from various parts of the Commonwealth, and 
the commendation of the State superintendent of public instruction, 
show that the service is valuable and is appreciated. During 1909-10 
70 new library stations were established, and the total circulation of 
the books in the traveling library system was 29,129, while the total 
number of borrowers was 6,450. The benefits of the system are 
increasing each year, and it has grown to be a most important factor 
in the educational work of the State. 
The libraries consist of fixed collections, numbering from 25 to 50 
carefully selected volumes, and are sent out free of charge to a pub- 
lic school, a community, a study club, a literary society, or, in fact, 
to any organization in the State desiring books. At present the 
libraries are grouped as follows: School libraries for schools, general 
ibraries for communities, and special libraries for aid along partic- 
lar lines of study, used by study clubs, literary societies, ete. Each 
ibrary is allowed to remain at a traveling library station for six 
onths, if it be a general or special collection, and in the case of a 
chool collection for an entire school session, generally eight or nine 
onths. At the end of the allotted time the library is returned to the 
tate library at Richmond and another is sent in exchange.  
-P-A-G-E-232
  
  212 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
The traveling libraries are intended, primarily, to meet the needs 
of the rural population; they are also intended for cities and towns 
which have no public library, and for schools without libraries or 
with libraries requiring supplementation. 
In the case of the general and special libraries, application blanks 
must be signed by the officers of a local library association, formed 
for the purpose, and by 10 taxpayers, while for school libraries only 
the taxpayers’ certificate is required, including the signature of the 
division superintendent and the principal of the school. In all cases 
a person designated to act as librarian agrees to care for the books 
while in his or her custody, make any reports required concerning 
their use, and return them in good order to the State library at Rich- 
mond, when another ‘‘fixed group”’ will be sent. Each community 
or school consequently receives a different set of books each time, 
and eventually may have use of all books in the system—over 10,000 
choice volumes. As a contribution to public education, the railroads 
and steamships operating in Virginia transport the books free of 
charge to and from Richmond. 
At present a movement for public library extension is in progress, 
under the auspices of the Virginia Library Association, which was 
organized in 1908. The plan is to enlarge the powers of the existing 
State library board by adding to its present functions the work of 
attempting, through a field agent as organizer, to create libraries all 
over the State, so that every town may have its own free public 
library. This proposal will be submitted to the legislature at its 
next session, in 1912. 
At the third annual meeting of the Library Association of Virginia, 
held in connection with the Virginia educational conference in Rich- 
mond on November 25, 1910, Ex-Gov. Andrew Jackson Mon- 
tague presided. State Superintendent of Public Instruction J. D. 
Eggleston, jr., after praising the good work of the traveling libraries, 
and showing their importance as precursors of permanent book col- 
lections, expressed the desire that a library organizer be secured at 
the next meeting of the legislature, and was supported by other 
speakers. The meeting was well attended, and was marked by inter- 
est and enthusiasm. 
The members of the Virginia State library board are Armistead C. 
Gordon, chairman, Staunton; John W. Fishburne, Charlottesville; 
Theodore S. Garnett, Norfolk; S. S. P. Patteson, Richmond; Ed- 
mund Pendleton, Richmond. Executive staff: H. R. McIlwaine, 
State librarian; George Carrington Moseley, chief of traveling library 
department.

WASHINGTON. 
The State library commission of Washington, consisting of the 
governor, the judges of the supreme court, and the attorney general, 
was created by the law of 1903 to have charge of the State library 
and all its departments. The State librarian is secretary ex officio 
of the commission. In addition there is an advisory board which 
consists of the superintendent of public instruction and four per- 
sons appointed by.the governor, one of whom must be a person 
recommended. by the Washington State Historical Society and 
another a person recommended by the State Federation of Women’s 
Clubs. The advisory board is directed by the law to give particular 
attention to building up a State historical department and a system 
of traveling libraries, and to give advice and counsel to all free 
libraries in the State regarding methods of establishment and admin- 
istration. The present members of the State library advisory board 
are Henry B. Dewey, superintendent of public instruction; Mrs. 
Kate Turner Holmes, Seattle, representing Washington State Fed- 
eration of Women’s Clubs; William E. Henry, librarian State Uni- 
versity; Franklin F. Hopper, librarian Tacoma public library, 
representing Washington Historical Society; and Senator John D. 
Bassett, president of Ritzville public library board. 
In his report for 1909-10 the State librarian notes a large increase 
of calls for books from remote parts of the State and from persons 
evidently engaged in serious research work. No effort is spared to 
encourage this phase of the work. Much more could be done if funds 
would permit the purchase of fitting sets of books along the lines of 
study of annual club programs and in sufficient numbers to supply 
several clubs pursuing the same lines of work. It is found that 
several clubs or groups of persons commonly want the same books, 
and want them for a length of time that precludes the possibility of 
a division among them of the stock available. 
During 1909-10 no less than 22 libraries were established, including 
a few reported as high-school] libraries. No purely school libraries, 
however, are included in that number, but only those which are such 
until the community can assume and. maintain them as public 
libraries, the public having access to them in the meantime. This 
increase is more than 100 per cent over the rate of the preceding 
biennium. Many of these, however, still need assistance from the 
State—financiai assistance if the funds were in hand, but at least 
technical assistance in furthering their campaign for support locally 
and for direction in the administrative problems incident to organi- 
zation. Besides these libraries already established and needing 
assistance there are many places which have appealed to the State 
library for help in creating and directing a public sentiment in favor 
of establishing a local public library. There should, therefore, be a
-P-A-G-E-234
214 ; EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
specialist in the field as an organizer, an adviser, an inspector of public 
libraries, and the legislature will be asked to provide for this want. 
A beginning has been made toward the organization of a legis- 
lative reference department, but this branch of the work has not yet 
been sufficiently developed to yield the best results. 
The statutes of Washington give permission to the county com- 
missioners of each county to provide by taxation, with certain limi- 
tations, a circulating library for the use of the schools of that county. 
The necessity for library facilities in the operation of the schools is 
so well established that 2 movement is under way to make this law 
compulsory, as in California and some other States. 
The number of libraries in Washington which occupy their own 
buildings instead of rented or temporary quarters is indicative of the 
substantial nature of the library movement in the State, and in most . 
cases the plans exhibit the latest devices and arrangements for effect- 
ive administration. There are in the State 24 Carnegie buildings, 
with an aggregate valuation of $747,000. 
The traveling library of Washington was begun by the State Fed- 
eration of Women’s Clubs and turned over to the State library com- 
mission on its establishment in 1901. In 1908, when the commission 
was reorganized, the traveling libraries were made a department of the 
State library. By the law of 1907 the traveling library work is placed 
in the hands of a secretary of the traveling library, appointed by the 
commission, but independent of the State library. 
The libraries are sent to any community upon the application of 
three responsible persons and upon the payment of transportation 
charges. A special effort has been made to reach study clubs, which 
are urged to send in programs. Lists of books in the State 
library bearing on the subjects are sent to the clubs to make their 
selection. The only expense to the clubs is the transportation fee, 
and any number of books desired are supplied. 
In 1907-8 the work of the traveling library was extended until 
there were 150 libraries in the field. Owing to lack of monéy and of 
assistance, no effort has been made during 1909-10 to extend the 
work. 
The following statistics are taken from the report of the secretary 
of the traveling library for 1909-10: Reported registration readers 
in four years, 23,709; in reality, over 70,000. Reported circulation 
books in four years, 85,174; in reality, over 255,000. Ilustrated 
magazines and papers given away in four years, approximately 
18,790. Applications on file in four years, 403. Books in the library, 
in round numbers, 8,000. This department has helped to establish, 
in some instances, and has supplied to all, books for 75 public libra- 
ries, reading rooms, high-school libraries, Y. M. C. A. and W. C. T. U. 
libraries, and grange halls. Women’s clubs, boys’ clubs, and com- 
mercial clubs are also patrons.

WISCONSIN. 
The free library commission carries on its work of library extension 
in Wisconsin through (1) the instructional department, which in- 
cludes the maintenance of the Wisconsin library school, as well as a 
summer school and various library institutes; (2) the department of 
library extension and visitation; (3) the traveling library depart- 
ment; and (4) the legislative reference department, which includes a 
bill-drafting department as well as a reference library. 
Since libraries are now found in nearly all Wisconsin communities 
of resources sufficient to maintain them, the recent work of the com- 
mission has been directed toward strengthening and vitalizing institu- 
tions already existing, rather than toward founding new libraries. 
The department of library extension and visitation aims to visit 
every free library of the State at least once each year to render counsel 
and cooperation, and devotes an average of two days to each visit. 
If for any reason a library is in need of special help, more than one 
annual visit is made. A report regarding each visit is prepared and 
placed on file. In performing this field work the commission has 
always placed the needs of the libraries in the smaller communities 
first, believing that the libraries in the larger cities are better able to 
care for themselves. During the year ending June 30, 1909, the 
members of the staff made 162 visits to 108 libraries. During the 
year ending June 30, 1910, they made 217 visits to 156 libraries. Of 
the 182 libraries in the regular visiting list, only 26 were not visited 
during the last fiscal year, and of these 17 are more properly traveling 
stations, so that only 9 libraries proper remained unvisited during 
the year. In addition, many visits were made to traveling library 
stations and to some of the smaller libraries by the chief of the travel- 
ing library department, who has also frequently appeared at farmers’ 
institutes, club meetings, and other gatherings, to which she goes to 
advance general library interests as well as those of the traveling 
library. Her work in aid of new library building projects has been 
of special value. Furthermore, the secretary made numerous calls 
upon various librarians and library boards for various special pur- 
poses, while he and members of the staff have also appeared in many 
educational meetings and library meetings throughout the State. 
From the library school, during February and March of each year, 
students are sent to do apprentice work in various libraries of the 
State. During the year ending June 30, 1909, 19 students gave their 
services without compensation in 15 different libraries, and during 
the ensuing year 26 students gave services in 23 libraries. Trained 
assistance has thus been rendered to institutions needing it in various 
parts of the State. 
Among the phases of library work upon which the commission is 
now laying special emphasis is that of the cooperation of the library 
   
-P-A-G-E-236
    216 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
with the schools, both because of its own keen appreciation of the 
value of this work and because it is the policy of the State, as evi- 
denced by the statutes. The State superintendent of public instruc- 
tion is a member of the State library commission; the superintendent 
of schools of every city is a member ex officio of the library board, 
Under the law requiring the expenditure of certain sums for the pur- 
pose, there is a school library in nearly every schoolhouse; the law 
also requires those applying for second-grade teachers’ certificates to 
have a knowledge of the cataloguing of libraries. The commission is 
therefore everywhere strongly urging the closest working relationship 
between the librarian and the teacher. In many cities classes are 
sent in school hours to the public library, there to learn the use of 
books and the resources of the library. It is found necessary in other 
places for the librarian to visit the schools in order to reach the pupils, 
although experience indicates that the ideal method is for the classes 
to go to the library. In all of the larger places, also, groups of books, 
including such as are particularly useful to the pupils, are sent to the 
schoolroom to be left for a considerable period of time and circulated 
under the direction of the teacher. Members of the commission staff 
have prepared outlines for the work with the schools and for instruc- 
tion to be given to the public-school pupils with reference to the 
resources of the library. The staff have also visited a number of 
educational meetings to urge upon teachers, by addresses and by 
personal suggestion, the value from an educational standpoint of 
cooperation between the teacher and librarian. 
Besides the room used for general library purposes, most libraries 
of Wisconsin have an auditorium and other smaller clubrooms. 
The librarians of the State are assisting in special reference work 
for debating clubs, study clubs, and commercial clubs, and are taking 
an active interest in civic improvement leagues. They arrange 
exhibitions and receptions in order to bring the people of the com- 
munity to the library building and make its possibilities known to 
all. The commission has taken the position that a men’s reading 
room so conducted as to be a smoking room and a clubroom as well 
meets a definite need. Many cities have instituted such reading 
rooms, and while they are not patronized as much as they should be, 
they are to some extent meeting this demand. 
The plans of the commission for next year include assistance by 
a field visitor in organizing boys’ clubs, civic leagues, etc., the work 
to be carried on usually through the local library, with direction and 
encouragement from the commission. The libraries of the State 
cooperate in every way possible with the local and State boards 
of health, and have proved to be efficient distributing points for the 
literature issued by the antituberculosis association. The com- 
mission has recently inaugurated special cooperation with the exten-
-P-A-G-E-237

sion department of the University of Wisconsin by loaning study 
groups to the extension department, which in turn places these at 
the disposal of its students. The bibliographical and other publi- 
cations of the commission have been of great general service. 
Traveling libraries circulated by the Wisconsin free library com- 
mission are composed of the best popular books of fiction, history, 
travel, biography, sociology, literature, useful arts, fine arts, and 
science, regularly including a number of children’s books. There 
are three sizes of the English collections, those of 30, 55, and 100 
volumes, respectively. The first size is sent to the isolated hamlets 
in the northern part of the State, the second to the regular stations 
of average size. These libraries are kept for six months and are 
then returned to the commission in exchange for another box, the 
only expense incurred in securing them being the payment of the 
freight on the box upon receipt and return. The 100-volume libra- 
ries, which are kept for six months, are rented for $12 a year to the 
smaller public libraries having inadequate book funds. 
German, Yiddish, Danish, Norwegian, and Polish traveling libra- 
ries, containing 35 volumes each, are loaned to public libraries for six 
months at a rental fee of $7 a year. Small groups of Bohemian, 
Danish, French, German, Norwegian, Polish, and Swedish books are 
often sent with the English traveling libraries to settlements of 
foreigners. 
The commission also has special collections of young folks’ books, 
which it loans without charge to small public libraries, and also 
furnishes study libraries to women’s clubs and other organizations 
upon payment of transportation charges. 
To secure a traveling library for a farming community or village, 
a library association which shall include at least ten citizens should 
first be organized and a librarian chosen. Application must be 
made on a blank furnished by the commission. The books of the 
traveling library must be loaned without charge to any person in the 
community who will agree to handle them carefully and to pay all 
fines and damages. 
As an evidence of the popularity of the libraries as a whole, it may 
be noted that the circulation of all the traveling libraries, exclusive of 
study club libraries—these being mainly used for reference pur- 
poses—was 216,439 for 1909-10, as against 193,319 for the two pre- 
ceding years. The growth in the number of stations for the past 
seven years has been as follows: 1904, 190; 1906, 279; 1908, 388; 1909, 
465; 1910, 618. During 1909-10 the sum of $2,510 was expended 
for 40 new traveling libraries for rural communities. A larger 
appropriation could well be employed in meeting the demand for 
extension of this work.  
-P-A-G-E-238
  218 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
Besides the State traveling libraries there are also 14 county 
systems of traveling libraries in Wisconsin, the organization of which — 
is permitted under special act of the legislature. These systems have 
a total of 334 libraries and 274 active stations. 
The members of the Wisconsin free library commission are W. H. 
Hatton, chairman; Matthew S. Dudgeon, secretary; Charles P. 
Cary, State superintendent of public schools, Reuben G. Thwaites, 
secretary State Historical Society; Charles R. Van Hise, president 
University of Wisconsin; Mrs. C. 8. Morris. 
SEABOARD AIR LINE FREE TRAVELING LIBRARY SYSTEM. 
For more than a decade past a system of free traveling libraries 
has been maintained under the auspices of the Seaboard Air Line 
Railway, along its lines extending through six Southern States. 
The late E. St. John, vice president and general manager of the 
road, was the originator of the system, and Andrew Carnegie has 
contributed to its support. Mrs. Eugene B. Heard, of ‘‘Rose Hill,” 
Middleton, Ga., is the general superintendent. 
This system of free traveling libraries was the first established in 
the South, and has been a potent factor in bringing about library 
legislation in the six Southern States coming under its influence. 
Hundreds of small towns and hundreds of schools have establislied 
permanent libraries due to the interest created by the use of the 
community and school libraries of the Seaboard Air Line free trav- 
eling library system. The work has a place all its own as one of the 
important educational movements for the rural South. 
From the first, Mr. St. John and Mrs. Heard laid special stress 
upon school betterment, and required that each community under- 
take some work of internal improvement, as guarantee that they 
deserve the use of a library. 
Many letters from principals, pupils, and parents, to the following 
purport, are on file at Rose Hill: ‘‘We are putting glass in the 
schoolhouse windows ourselves; we are cleaning the yard of the 
schoolhouse; we have collected money to paint the schoolhouse.” 
Accompanying this report of improved conditions is always the 
request, ‘‘Will you not now send us a school library? We will take 
good care of the books and not soil them more than we can help.” 
In the year 1909, 50,000 children had the advantage of the Sea- 
board libraries, and the number is constantly increasing. 
In addition to the 150 school libraries now in circulation along 
the Seaboard Air Line, there are some 35 ‘‘community libraries,” 
which are the result of Mrs. Heard’s personal visits to the dreary 
flag stations, to the out-of-the-way places where the families of 
employees were shut off almost entirely from intercourse with the 
outer world.

    One of the most important features of the work is that with maga- 
zines and periodicals, which are shipped to the various stations in 
sacks twice a month, and come as gifts fresh from the publishers. 
In a single year, 1909, 17,000 magazines and periodicals were sent 
to the families of section foremen, while 5,000 copies were sent to 
the negro settlements. Numbers of reading tables for these publi- 
cations have been established in rural communities, and their use 
not only creates a taste for reading but paves the way to a demand 
for the libraries. 
ADDENDA. 
NOTES RELATING TO LIBRARIES. 
Three leading libraries—The number of volumes and pamphlets contained in the 
three largest libraries in the United States was officially reported as follows on the 
dates named: Library of Congress, 1,891,729 volumes and pamphlets, June 30, 1911; 
New York Public Library, 1,110,632 volumes and pamphlets in main collection, 
809,350 in branches, December 31, 1910; Boston Public Library, 987,268 volumes and 
pamphlets, January 31, 1911. 
New York Public Library building —The magnificent new building of the New York 
Public Library was formally dedicated on May 23, 1911, President Taft, Gov. Dix, 
and Mayor Gaynor participating in the exercises. On the following morning the 
library was opened for business. The edifice, designed in the modern Renaissance 
style of architecture and constructed of white marble throughout, has cost more than 
$10,000,000, and was over 12 years in building. Its endowment and collections were 
provided by an amalgamation of three private foundations—the Astor Library, the 
Lenox Library, and the Tilden Foundation—but the city donated the land and paid 
the cost of the building. This great library has accommodations for about 3,000,000 
volumes and over 1,700 readers. One of the most interesting features of this institu- 
tion is the cooperative work accomplished in connection with the public-school sys- 
tem of New York City. 
Other notable buildings.—It is expected that the new building of the St. Louis Public 
Library, now under construction, will be ready for occupancy in 1912. A new Car- 
negie library building for the University of Tennessee, with a capacity of 100,000 
volumes, was dedicated in May, 1911, and new library buildings for the University 
of Chicago and the University of Texas have been under way during the past year. 
Plans for a new library building at Harvard University also, to cost $2,000,000 and 
‘with shelving room for 2,400,000 volumes, have recently been drawn by direction of 
the committee of the board of overseers. Progress during the past year on the building 
for the Connecticut State Library is reported; and new educational buildings, to 
include accommodations for the respective State libraries, are under construction in 
New York and contemplated for Illinois and Indiana. 
Library day.—In West Virginia, the establishment of school libraries is advancing, 
under the supervision of the State department of education, and the pupils’ interest 
fin books and reading is fostered by the observance of an annual Library day in the 
ublic schools. »

This chapter continues the record of current events practically on 
the lines followed in the three previous reports of this office, but 
with modifications rendered necessary by changes in the arrange- 
ment and subject matter of the remaining portions of the report; 
reference is here made, in particular, to the more extended treatment 
of certain departments of education in the United States which have 
been left for several years entirely to the statistical presentations of 
the second volume of the report. 
As regards educational boards and commissions, accounts are 
given in this chapter of those only which are exercising a predomi- 
nant influence upon the general movement of education, or which, 
in their annual meetings for the present year, made some distinctive 
contribution to the discussion of the specialties to which they sev- 
erally pertain. 
I, EDUCATIONAL BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS. 
  
GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD. 
The General Education Board has three main lines of endeavor, 
namely: (1) The promotion of practical farming in the Southern 
States; (2) the development of a system of public high schools in the 
Southern States; and (3) the promotion of higher education through- 
out the United States.

    222 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
The object of the board is not to undertake independent educa- 
tional work, but to secure results through established institutions and 
agencies. The annual report of this office for the year 1910 con- 
tains a complete statement of the policy of the General Education 
Board, prepared by the assistant secretary of the board, Mr. E. C. 
Sage. ; 
The following is a summary of the financial report of the board, 
giving a general view of the principal, income, and expenditures of 
the different funds under the jurisdiction of the board for the year

CARNEGIE FOUNDATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF TEACHING. 
The fifth annual report of the Carnegie Foundation, covering the 
administration of the trust for the year beginning October 1, 1909, 
and terminating September 30, 1910, comprises two parts: Part I, 
relating to the current business of the year; Part II, discussing the 
relation of the college and the secondary school. 
According to the report the trustees had in hand at the end of the 
year funds amounting to $11,114,056.86, consisting of the original 
gift of $10,000,000 par value of 5 per cent bonds and $1,000,000 
accumulated surplus. The total income for the year aggregated
-P-A-G-E-245
EDUCATIONAL BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS. 225 
$543,881.20. Sixty-four retiring allowances were granted during 
the year, of which 46 were in accepted institutions and 18 in insti- 
tutions not on the accepted list. During the year 23 pensioners 
died. Of those admitted to the benefits of the foundation, 39 were 
professors and 7 were widows of professors in accepted institutions; 
13 were professors and 5 widows of professors in institutions not 
accepted. Thirty-six of the number were retired on the basis of 
age and 3 on the basis of disability. The general average of retiring 
allowances for the year was $1,898.85. The total number of bene- 
ficiaries September 36, 1910, was 346, and the total grant in force at 
that date was $521,070. Four institutions have been admitted to 
the accepted list of the foundation during the year, namely, Univer- ~ 
sity of California, Indiana University, and Purdue University, ‘‘as 
component parts of a single State university,” and Wesleyan Uni- 
versity. 
The president of the foundation, Dr. Henry S. Pritchett, in the 
first part of the report, follows up the bulletin on medical education, 
by Mr. Abraham Flexner, by » paper on ‘“‘The college and univer- 
sity in relation tc medical education.” He calls attention to the 
responsibility incurred by any college or university which under- 
takes medical education. These institutions, he says, have ‘no 
longer any excuse for offering the routine medical education current 
during the past 20 years, and it is no humiliation for any college to 
abandon part ef the werk which it has hitherto carried on when 
changed conditions render it impossible to continue that work 
honestly within the financial limitations by which the college is 
bounded. The honest college shouid either offer a medical educa- 
tion consistent with the standards of our day or else should retire 
frankly from the field.” 
The relations of colleges and secondary schools are extensively 
treated in the second part of the report. 
The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching is also 
in charge of the system of exchange of American teachers between 
Prussia and the United States, which is opevated under the same 
arrangement as in previous years. For the scademic vear 1910-11 
eight American teachers were assigned to Prussian schools and five 
Prussian teachers were assigned to schools in this country. 
JOHN F. SLATER FUND. 
At the forty-fourth meeting of the trustees of the fund, held in 
New York City, April 29, 1910, the finance committee recommended 
that $80,000 be designated for appropriations and expenses for the 
fiscal year 1910-11. The educational committee was empowered to 
make appropriations not exceeding the amount avaiiabie. The

report of the educational committee on plan of cooperation with the 
trustees of the Anna T. Jeanes Fund was submitted and approved. 
Bishop William Lawrence, of Boston, Mass., was elected a member 
of the board and Dr. James H. Dillard was elected general agent. 
At the forty-fifth meeting of the trustees, held in Washington, 
D. C., December 13, 1910, the educational committee reported that 
appropriations amounting to $68,400 had been made to 47 schools 
and colleges for the colored race in the Southern States. Supple- 
mentary appropriations amounting to $800 were also made. A 
committee was appointed to act with a similar committee of the 
Anna T. Jeanes Fund in carrying out the plans for cooperation 
between the two boards. Dr. Wallace Buttrick resigned as a member 
of the board, and Dr. James H. Dillard, of New Orleans, and Hon. 
Charles E. Hughes, of Washington, D. C., were elected members. 
The trustees of the fund for 1910 were: William A. Slater, presi- 
dent; Richard H. Williams, vice president; John A. Stewart, Alex- 
ander E. Orr, Cleveland H. Dodge, Seth Low, David F. Houston, 
Wickliffe Rose, Walter H. Page, William Lawrence, James H. Dillard, 
Charles E. Hughes. 
Dr. James H. Dillard, New Orleans, is the general agent and secre- 
tary of the board, and the field agents are B. C. Caldwell, New Orleans, 
and W. T. B. Williams, Hampton Institute, Va. 
PEABODY EDUCATION FUND AND THE SOUTHERN EDUCATION BOARD. 
During the current year the Peabody Education Fund and the 
funds of the Southern Education Board have been administered in 
cooperation with State and county authorities in building up State 
systems of rural schools. Contributions have been made to this work 
in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Ala- 
bama, Mississippi, Texas, Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky, and West 
Virginia. 
The funds have contributed in the main to the maintenance of 
four lines of activity: 
1. The maintenance of a State supervisor of rural schools in each 
of 11 States. This supervisor is appointed in each case by the State 
board of education or proper State authorities, and is thus made a 
State official with all the powers and responsibilities belonging to 
such position. He does his work under the general supervision of the 
State department of education, and devotes his whole time to the 
building up of the rural schools of his State. 
The main work of these men is directed toward the following ends: 
More adequate supervision; more adequate funds by increased local 
taxation; the improvement of rural schoolhouses; the adoption of 
suitable courses of study; the consolidation of small schools into
-P-A-G-E-247
    EDUCATIONAL BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS. 
strong centralized graded schools. They are making in detail an 
educational survey of the several States by counties and exhibiting 
the educational conditions as they are. This record of facts is to serve 
as the starting point for constructive effort to place the rural 
schools on a sound financial basis and to bring them under effective 
supervision. 
2. As an experiment, contributions have been made this year 
toward the maintenance of a small number of county supervisors of 
teaching in country schools. This county supervisor devotes her 
entire time to the improvement of teaching in rural schools. She is to 
show them by demonstration. The work is under the general super- 
vision of the county superintendent of schools and the State super- 
visor of rural schools. 
3. Contributions are made toward the maintenance in each State 
of a State supervisor of school-improvement leagues. These are 
associations of citizens organized about the school as a center. Their 
primary purpose is to improve the schoolhouse and grounds, but this 
frequently leads to a campaign for local taxation and to a larger 
community effort for civic improvement. 
4. Contributions are made from time to time toward the support 
of educational campaigns. This is done when it becomes necessary 
to go before the people of a community, a county, or a State in the 
interest of some definite educational end. 
These activities are reported quarterly to the State departments 
of education, and through these departments to the office of the two 
funds at Washington. Here these reports are manifolded, bound 
together, and a copy sent to the workers in each State. In like 
manner any significant development in one State is reported at once 
to all the other States. The office of the funds is serving as a center 
for collecting and distributing information bearing directly upon the 
work in which these State supervisors are engaged. The State 
supervisors of rural schools have been called together twice during 
the year in special conference, and a group of State superintendents 
nd State supervisors made a tour through the Middle West for the 
urpose of studying the consolidated rural schools in counties that 
nave achieved the best results. A report of this study tour is now 
n. press and will be supplied to each of the workers in these States. 
The chairman of the Southern Education Board is Mr. Robert C. 
gden, of New York City, and the executive secretary Dr. Wickliffe 
ose, Southern Building, Washington, D. C. Dr. Rose is also 
eneral agent of the Peabody Fund.

228 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
STATE EDUCATIONAL COMMISSIONS. 
WISCONSIN COMMISSION ON INDUSTRIAL AND AGRICULTURAL 
EXTENSION. 
The commissicn which was appointed by the Legislature of the 
State of Wisconsin in the year 1909 to investigate the subject of 
industrial and agricultural instruction and formulate plans upon 
which to base legislative action submitted its report to the governor 
eu January 10, 1911. 
The commission urgently recommends continuation schools, with 
compulsory attendance of children from 14 to 16 years of age already 
engaged in industry, supplemented by trade and evening schools. 
It urges the limitation of children’s labor to eight hours, including all 
time occupied in vocational schools, and advises the modernization 
and extension of outgrown apprentice laws and their adaptation to 
the requirements of proposed industrial schools. 
In regard to rural schools, the commission advises the establish- 
ment of a central board of education, elected at large for each county, 
this board to engage a county superintendent and to consolidate 
chool districts and discontinue schools at will. State aid is recom- 
mended for consolidated schools, provided agriculture or agriculture 
and domestic science are introduced, and provided courses of study 
and teachers shall be subject to the approval of the State superinten- 
dent. Additional State aid is recommended for Siate graded schools, 
village and city schools, and township high schools, with the same 
provisions specified for rural schools. 
The commission further proposed that each county agricultural 
school shall receive from the State $6,000 per annum instead of the 
present sum of $4,000, provided that the county contribute not less 
than the State if the State contributes more than $4,000. 
In order to illustrate how continuation schools may be adapted to 
the requirements of the State—in villages as well as in cities—the 
commission presents an elaborate survey of the field of German 
industrial education. The tendency of industrial schools to become 
theoretical instead of practical, and the manner of obviating the 
difficulty, are emphasized. The report says:        
       
  After a long period of trial, the Germans have established almost universaiiy iocai 
committees of business men, manufacturers. and workmen, who control these schools 
wherever they are * * *. 
We believe that the State of Wisconsin, instead of relying upon the establishmenu 
of trade schoois suci: as have been set up in the thickly populated State of Massachu-| 
setts, should begin at once a plan of providing for this period of 14 to 16 years of age| 
by means of continuation schools. In that way we can reach the greatest number at| 
the least cost and we can allow the system to grow gradually and with the best results. 
It is the general agreement of all investigators * * * that boys are not general: 
wanted as apprentices before they are 16 years of age. ‘Therefore, if they leave schoo! 
at 14 they practically waste their time.     
        
   
      
-P-A-G-E-249
EDUCATIONAL BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS. 229 
The recommendations regarding industrial education depend for 
their effectiveness upon the State University, which is relied upon to 
fill the gaps in the system and render it sufficiently elastic to meet 
local requirements without bringing toe heavy burdens upon the 
poorer communities. 
In regard to the training of teachers in industrial and agricuitural 
schools, the report reeommends— 
That a minimum salary law be passed which shall apply to all teachers in indusirial 
and agricultural subjects, and which, while placing emphasis upon thoroughgoing 
general training, shall place an additional premium upon special preparation for the 
teaching of agricultural and industrial subjects. 
That adequate provision be made in some State institution of normal-school grade 
and in the country training schools for the establishment of courses of instruction in 
industrial and agricultural education and the extension of courses already in existence 
of a character that will give proper emphasis to industrial and agricultural training. 
That the high schools in the State other than the free high schools, commonly known 
as the independent high schools, shall receive State aid for manual training, agricul- 
ture, and domestic economy to the same extent that State aid is granted to free high 
schools for these purposes. 
ILLINOIS EDUCATIONAL COMMISSION. 
The Illinois Educational Commission, appointed in 1907 and sub- 
sequently reappointed by Gov. Deneen, submitted a report to the 
forty-seventh general assembly. During the progress of its investi- 
gations, this commission has published nine bulletins embodying the 
results of its examination of the schoo! iaws and school systems of 
other States, and tentative recommendations relative to measures for 
improving the system of [llinois. These bulletins have excited wide 
attention. The report of the commission, and also three bills sub- 
mitted by this body for legislative action, are considered under the 
head of General Laws. chapter 3, pages 71-72. 
INDIANA EDUCATIONAL COMMISSION. 
An act was passed at the sixty-seventh regular session of the 
General Assembly of the State of Indiana providing for ‘‘an investi- 
gation of the needs for and the methods of industrial and agricultural 
education.” By this act, which was approved March 4, 1911, the 
governor was authorized to appoint— 
a suitable commission of seven persons, either from within or without the public ser- 
vice of Indiana, representing the manufacturing, labor, agricultural, and educational 
interests of the State, to be known es the Commission on Industrial and Agricultural 
Education. The commission shaii investigate the needs of education in the different 
industries of Indiana, and how far the needs are met by existing institutions, and shall 
consider what new forms of educational effort may be advisable and shall make such 
investigations as may be practicable through printed reports and the testimony of 
experts as to similar educational work done by other States, by the United States

Government, and by foreign Governments. The commission shall hold hearings in 
at least five different communities of the State and invite the testimony of interested. 
parties and experts, and shall make a report to the governor for transmission to the 
legislature not later than January 1, 1913. 
PENNSYLVANIA EDUCATIONAL COMMISSION. 
The educational commission, constituted by the Legislature of 
Pennsylvania in 1907, to revise and codify the school law of the State, 
submitted a report at the legislative session of 1909. After numerous 
amendments had been made, the code was adopted by the legislature, 
but was vetoed by the governor, principally because the changes had 
introduced contradictory provisions and destroyed the harmony of the 
bill. The members of the commission, however, continued to meet 
at their own expense, and formulated a revised code eliminating the 
features which had failed to meet general approval. The principal 
features of this revised code, which was adopted by the legislature 
in the session of 1911, are presented in the chapter on General Laws, 
page 69. 
SOUTH CAROLINA EDUCATIONAL COMMISSION. 
The report of the commission to examine and revise the school law 
of South Carolina and recommend changes in the same was submitted 
to the general assembly on January 2, 1911. The new code was 
favorably reported in both houses, but final action was not taken. 
It is expected that the code will be adopted at the next session of the 
legislature. 
OTHER COMMISSIONS. 
The results of the labors of the school law commission of Idaho, 
created by legislative act of March 15, 1909, and of the committee 
appointed to investigate the conduct of the public school system of 
New Jersey, and of the special commission appointed for a similar 
purpose by the Legislature of Delaware in 1909, are presented in 
detail in chapter 3, pages 69, 73, 75. 
A pill was passed by the Legislature of Montana authorizing the 
appointment of a commission to codify and collate the school laws. 
The consideration of a bill providing for an educational commission 
to have general supervision and control of public educational institu- 
tions was indefinitely postponed in the Legislature of Minnesota. 
The Forty-seventh General Assembly of the State of Illinois passed 
an act at its regular biennial session, approved May 26, 1911, pro- 
viding for a commission to procure plans and specifications for a 
suitable State building, to be erected by the State, where all the 
property pertaining ‘‘to the history, science, literature, education, 
and patriotism now housed in different departments of the State 
  
-P-A-G-E-251

buildings may be placed.” The department of public instruction is 
at present inadequately housed. 
The General Assembly of Indiana, at its sixty-seventh regular ses- 
sion, passed an act, approved March 1,.1911, appointing a commis- 
sion to formulate plans for the celebration of the admission of Indiana 
into the Union by the erection of a State building and its dedication 
in 1916, to be known as the Indiana Educational Building. The 
State library and museum, public library commission, and the edu- 
cational and scientific offices of the State will be housed in this 
building.

NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION. 
Winona, Minn., August 23, 1911. 
_ Sm: By the provisions of section 4 of the act of incorporation of 
the National Education Association by Congress, approved June 30, 
1906, I am required to render to you, on behalf of the corporation of 
said association, an annual report, stating the amount of property, 
real and personal, held by the corporation and the various receipts 
and expenditures during the past year. 
I am submitting herewith such a report, as follows: 
The association holds as personal property approximately 10,000 
volumes of poceedings in the depository of the association at the 
office of the secretary in Winona, Minn., valued at $10,000; 5,000 
pamphlets and reprints, valued at $800; office furniture, cases, and 
equipment, valued at $500; total personal property at Winona, 
$11,300. 
An office is maintained in the city of Washington, at 662 E Street 
NE., in accordance with'section 8 of the act of incorporation, but the 
association owns no property, real or personal, in the city of 
Washington. 
The business of the association is transacted at the office estab- 
lished by authority of the board of directors at Winona, Minn. 
The association has a permanent invested fund, referred to in sec- 
tion 7 of the act of incorporation, which is in the charge of the board 
of trustees. This fund at the close of the last fiscal year, June 30, 
1911, amounted to $180,000, $9,900 having been added to that fund 
during the fiscal year. 
You will note that the net revenue from this fund amounted to 
$6,797.71, which was transferred to the treasury of the association 
for current expenses. 
The fiscal year of the association is from July 1 to the following 
June 30, the last fiscal year closing June 30, 1911. For this last fiscal
-P-A-G-E-252
  
232 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
year the total receipts for current expenses from all sources were 
$48,909.08; the total expenses for the year were $34,978.95; the 
amount transferred to the permanent fund was $9,900; leaving a bal- 
ance in the treasury June 30, 1911, of $4,030.13. 
The chief sources of revenue are membership fees, proceeds of sale 
of volumes and reports, and revenue from the invested fund. 
- The chief sources of expense of the association are the printing and 
disteibutioti of the annual volumes, the maintenance of thes secretary’s 
office and clerical force at Winona, Minn., and the expense of prepar- 
ing for and conducting the annual convention. 
While a large part of the revenue comes from the associate member- 
ship fees received at the annual convention, a still larger amount 
comes as annual dues of $2 for each member from approximately 
7,500 active (permanent) members of the association. 
In view of the favorable financial condition of the association, the 
board of directors, under the advice of the committee on investiga- 
tions and appropriations of the nationai council, appropriated the 
following sums to the respective committees as named, for investiga- + 
tions and reports: 
   
    Committee on uniform statistics and reports..............-------------------- $500 
Committee on articulation of high schools and colleges 300 
Committee on cosmopolitan high school............-- 2 800, 
Committee on geometry syllabus in secondary schoo 306 
Committee on conservation of vision of school pupils...............--.--.---- 500 
Committee on rural and agricultural education... .. 1, 000 
Committee on economy of time in education...............---.-------+2---- 300 
Worl spe AS Ae Stas s ae eee tt a ae ee * Bowater ees 3, 200 
In addition to the above appropriations, the active members at the 
annual meeting adopted, without discussion, a resolution directing 
the board of directors to appropriate $3,000 for the expenses of a 
committee to be appointed to make an investigation concerning sal- 
aries, tenure, and pensions of teachers, and to make report thereon. 
It is probable that this report will be principally devoted to the rela- 
tions of the increased cost of living to teachers’ salaries and be sup- 
plementary to the report of the committee on teachers’ salaries, 
tenure, and pensions, made in 1905, under the chairmanship of Hon. 
Carroll D. Wright, at that time United States Commissioner of Tabor, 
and for the preparation of which the association expended much more 
than $3,000, in addition to Government aid through gratuitous serv- 
ices of Government statisticians. This report has been extensively 
distributed and is still in active demand and could hardly be 
superseded. 
The last convention of the association, the forty-ninth, held at San 
Francisco, Cal., July 8 to 14, was in every respect successful.
-P-A-G-E-253
EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATIONS, CONFERENCES, ETC. 233 
The total registration was 11,480. This registration was slightly 
less than the registration last year at Boston, which was 12,385, but 
larger than the registration at Denver in 1909, 5,375, and at Cleveland 
in 1908, 8,328. The most prominent feature of the convention was 
the opening session held in the Greek Theater at the University of 
California, in Berkeley. The addresses of welcome were delivered 
by Gov. Hiram W. Johnson, of California, Mayor P. H. McCarthy, of 
San Francisco, and President Benjamin Ide Wheeler, of the Univer- 
sity of California. The introduction of President Ella Flagg Young 
was made by Josiah Little Pickard, of Cupertino, Cal., who was pres- 
ident of the association at its meeting in 1871, and who was asso- 
ciated with President Young in the Chicago public schools in 1865 
and later. 
The other general sessions and the sessions of all the 17 departments 
were successful, as usual. While a great variety of important topics 
were discussed, moral education, industrial education, physical edu- 
cation, school hygiene, the education of subnormal children, and the 
relation of high schoois to colleges received the most attention. 
Probably the most important discussion was that of the report of the 
committee on a system of moral education in public schools, by. a 
committee of the council that had been working on this subject. f for 
several years. This discussion closed with a joint session with the 
Religious Education Association, at which addresses were presented 
by members of that association on various phases of the committee 
report. 
The following associations met with the National Education Asso- 
ciation in convention, each such association holding its own series 
of meetings, as follows: The Federation of State Teachers’ Associa- 
tions, The American School Peace League, The School Garden 
Association of America, The Religious Education Association, The 
Educational Press Association of America, and The American Home 
Economics Association. 
The following generai officers were elected for the ensuing year: 
President, Carroll G. Pearse, of Milwaukee, Wis.; vice president, 
Ella Flagg Young, of Chicago, Ill. (the outgoing president), and 10 
others; treasurer, Katherine Devereux Blake, of New York City. 
There were also elected one director for each State and Territory, 
including Hawaii, the Philippine Islands, and the District of Columbia. 
The executive committee for the ensuing year will be constituted 
as follows: Carroll G. Pearse, president, superintendent of schools, 
Milwaukee, Wis.; Ella Flagg Young, first vice president, superin- 
tendent of schools, Chicago, Ill.; Katherine D. Blake, treasurer, 
principal, public school, New York City; James M. Greenwood, chair-

DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE, NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSO- 
CIATION. F 
The Department of Superintendence, National Education Asso- 
ciation, met in Mobile, Ala., on February 23-25, 1911. The first 
session was devoted to a review of the vigorous educational movement 
in the Southern States. At the second session Mrs. Ella Flagg 
Young, superintendent of schools of Chicago, Ill., and president of 
the National Education Association, discussed the status of present 
elementary school instruction, pointing out the great advance in the 
physical, mental, and vocational training now afforded, as compared 
with the past two decades. 
The program of the second day was given to a discussion of recent 
educational advances in respect to the city, the State, and the Nation. 
Hon. Charles E. Chadsey, superintendent of schools, Denver, Colo., 
spoke from the viewpoint of the city; Supt. Carey, of Wisconsin, dis- 
cussed “the rapid evolution resulting from the assistance which the 
various States are giving to education through the training of teachers, 
better laws for education, and greater funds.’”’ Hon. Elmer E. Brown, 
United States Commissioner of Education, discussed education as a 
national function, emphasizing ‘the necessity for cooperation 
between the various States in fixing a uniform standard of the various 
classes and grades of schools, in the certification of teachers, etc.” 
At the round-table meetings in the afternoon of the second day, 
the problem of economic administration received considerable atten- 
tion. Supt. J. H. Van Sickle, of Baltimore, displayed charts showing 
the actual results obtained from the use of the three-group system in 
reducing the number fo nonpromotions. 
The Saturday sessions were occupied with discussions of the open- 
air schools of Chicago, defective children, etc.

EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATIONS, CONFERENCES, ETC. 235 
At the annual business meeting Prof. George D. Strayer submitted 
a report of the committee on uniform reports and records, and Prof. 
Henry Suzzalo presented the report of the committee on economy 
of time in education. The report of the committee on the uniform 
key alphabet provoked considerable debate. The report was finally 
adopted by a vote of 403 to 368 and the committee was discharged. 
Resolutions were passed commending the work of the United States 
Bureau of Education, and recommending— 
       
   
                      
   
   
                                 
    
   the adoption by school authorities of the forms of record and reports as submitted by 
its committee on uniform school reports, provided that said forms shall be modified and 
improved as may be found expedient from year to year by conference of the United 
States Bureau of Education, the Bureau of the Census, the National Association of 
School Accounting Officers, and the committee on uniform school records and reports 
of the Department of Superintendence, 
The Department of Superintendence recognizes that thé present lack of uniformity 
in nomenclature found in texts in English grammar is confusing and unnecessary. 
It therefore authorizes the president of this department to appoint a committee of five 
to formulate and report at the next annual meeting of this department a system of 
nomenclature for texts in English grammar, and recommends that publishers of such 
texts use this system if adopted by the department. 
AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE: 
SECTION L—EDUCATION. 
At the Minneapolis meeting of the American Association for the 
Advancement of Science, Section L held five sessions. The first was 
a joint session with the American Psychological Association, at which 
reports were made on experimental investigations, as follows: ‘In- 
dividual differences in the correlations of physical growth of elemen- 
tary and high school pupils,’ by Bird T. Baldwin; ‘Experiments 
on the perception of number,” by Frank N. Freeman; ‘‘The genesis 
of attention in the educative process,” by Edgar James Swift; and 
(a) “Periods of work in learning,” (6) “Transference of practice,” 
by Daniel Starch; ‘‘The field of the consulting psychologist,” by 
C. E. Seashore; ‘‘What is educational psychology?’ by. Frederick 
E. Bolton. 
The second session was a joint session with the American Federa- 
tion of Teachers of the Mathematical and the Natural Sciences. At 
the meeting the topic, ‘‘Methods of testing results of science teach- 
ing,’ was discussed by Prof. E. L. Thorndike, of Columbia Uni- 
versity, and Prof. O. W. Caldwell, of the University of Chicago, 
presented reports of an experiment in testing the results of science 
eaching now in progress at his school. 
The third session was the general-interest session at which the 
topic ‘‘University extension teaching’? was discussed by President 
. Ross Hill, of the University of Missouri; President C. R. Van Hise; 
rof. Louis E. Reber, of the University of Wisconsin; and Prof. Albert 
. Rankin, of the University of Minnesota.

236 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
The fourth session was devoted to reports of the investigations in 
education, as follows: ‘‘The causes of elimination from high school,” 
' by J. K. Van Denburg and E. L. Thorndike, Columbia University; 
“The relations between the high schools and the colleges,” by C. H. 
Judd, University of Chicago; ‘‘Experience with the system of grad- 
ing in the University of Missouri,” by Max Meyer, University of 
Missouri; ‘‘New facts concerning retardation,” by G. D. Strayer, 
Columbia University; “A study of retardation in the schools of

F. Dearborn, University of Chicago; ‘‘Transfer of training, with spec- 
ial reference to the factors of rapidity and accuracy,” by S. S. Colvin, 
University of Illinois; ‘‘Some experiments in transfer of discipline,” 
by G. G. Fracker, State Normal School, Marquette, Mich. General 
discussion followed by Messrs. Angell, Cattell, Judd, O’Shea, Seashore, 
Thorndike, and others. 
AMERICAN FEDERATION OF ARTS. 
The American Federation vi Arts met at Washington, D. C., May 
16-18, 1911. Delegates from over 70 chapters—museums, public 
libraries, artists’ and laymen’s organizations—were present. The 
Hon. James Bryce, British ambassador, and the Hon. John Barrett, 
director of the Pan American Union, made brief addresses of wel- 
come. Prof. George P. Baker, of Harvard University, in an address 
on pageantry, showed the advantages to be derived through this 
medium in arousing the interest of the people in “‘the picturesque- 
ness of their own history and the nobility of their own occupations.” 
By the proper employment of pageantry, the natioal holidays would 
take on new significance. Mr. Henry T. Bailey spoke on art in the 
public schools, which, as he pointedly observed, is ‘‘no longer copy- 
ing straight-line figures and vase forms, or the making of abstract 
designs, but the application of the fundamental and unchanging 
principles of art to the daily lie of the child.” The needs and ad- 
vantages of a national schoo! cf industrial art were emphasized by 
Mr. Leslie W. Miller, principal of the Pennsylvania Museum and 
School of Industrial Art, at Philadelphia. Hon. Charles D. Walcott, 
secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, following Mr. Miiler, told 
of the development of a National Museum of Industrial Art as a 
branch of the National Galery. The subject of civic art was dis- 
cussed by Mr. Raymond Unwin, of England, and Mr, Walter G. Page. 
Mr. H. W. Kent, of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, proposed that}
-P-A-G-E-257
  
EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATIONS, CONFERENCES, ETC. 237 
the federation ‘‘should serve as a clearing house for art museums, 
not only circulating exhibitions but correlating and distributing 
information.” 
The secretary reported that lectures on American painting, Ameri- 
can sculpture, and civic art had been in constant circulation; that 
9 exhibitions had been sent to 33 cities. ‘ 
The following officers were elected to serve for two years: Presi- 
dent, Charles L. Hutchinson, of Chicago; secretary, F. D. Millet, of 
New York. 
AMERICAN FEDERATION OF TEACHERS OF THE MATHEMATICAL AND 
THE NATURAL SCIENCES. 
The annual meeting of the council of the American Federation of 
Teachers of the Mathematical and the Natural Sciences was held at 
the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minn., December 28, 1910. 
On December 29, the federation held a joint session with Section 
L, American Association for uae Advancement of Science. 
The committee on college entrance requirements in mathematics 
and science submitted the following resclutions for adoption: 
Resolved, That we urge the colleges to abandon the “unit system” and in its place 
to accept the certificate of the high school at: its face value for such work as it covers, 
and permit this to entitle the student to take up such college work as his preparation 
may warrant, whenever the certificate stands for fuuz years of systematic and thorough 
training in a good high school; and 
Resolved, That we recommend that the merits of the high school for such certifica- 
tion be determined by conference between schools and colleges in such associations 
as the North Central Association of Secondary Schools and Colleges, so that due weight 
may be given both to what the colleges desire and to what the schools can safely 
undertake; and 
Kesoived, That we request the colleges to consider whether the work done by its 
students in college does not in large part furnisn a better basis for testing the effi- 
ciency of school preparation than do the present methods of entrance examination 
and of official inspection; and 
Resolved, That as we consider the larger aud the more important duty of the second- 
ary school is the preparation of the students for immediate entrance upon useful life 
in their own communities, we believe the college should cease to discriminate against 
subjects that the schools find necessary in preparing their pupils for such duties; and 
Resolved, That we invite the college to come into more intimate contact with the 
secondary schools by requiring their professors who give general courses to do some 
visiting of the secondary schools at frequent intervals, sc that they may acquire a 
better personal acquaintance with high-school work and high-school conditions; and 
Resolved, That we urge upon college men that they take a larger part in the work 
of teachers’ associations, so as to secure real acquaintance and earnest cooperation, 
based upon mutual consideration and esteem; and 
Resolved, That we urge the colleges to offer greater facilities for the adequate train- 
ing of teachers; that liberai courses in pedagogy be established and ample oppor- 
tunities be offered tor practice teaching. Such influences for professional training, 
we believe, wili do far more to raise the standard of work in our high schools than the 
present entrance requirements or system of inspection.

  238 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
AMERICAN PHYSICAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION. 
The eighteenth convention of the American Physical Education 
Association was held in Boston, April 11-14, 1911. Dr. George L. 
Meylan, of Columbia University, in his presidential address, cited 
the fact that “the association has exerted a potent influence in bring- 
ing about the remarkable development in physical education which 
has taken place in the United States during the last 25 years.’’ The 
period from 1905 to the present time “‘has been characterized by con- 
siderable progress in various directions; first, the raising of standards 
in the professional schools of physical education. Six years ago, 
less than 10 per cent of the graduates in physical education received 
the bachelor’s degree at graduation, whereas now over 30 per cent 
complete courses leading to the first degree, and an increasing number 
pursue graduate studies for the master’s and doctor’s degrees; and, 
second, during this period has occurred a phenomenal growth of 
interest in all matters pertaining to the conservation of life and health, 
and the normal physical development of children, public and personal 
hygiene, and all matters pertaining to health and healthful living. 
All these interests are related more or less closely to physical educa- 
tion in its broadest sense. Of these new interests those which are 
most directly related to physical education are the playground and 
school hygiene movements.” 
That the value of physical education is now completely recognized 
in American colleges is shown by statistics gathered during the past 
year by the association from 124 of the leading colleges and univer- 
sities. Dr. Meylan said: : 
Ninety-five per cent offer regular courses in physical education and in 87 per cent 
these courses are prescribed. 
The prescription applies to freshmen only in 27 per cent of the colleges, to freshmen 
and sophomores in 44 per cent; in the other institutions the courses are prescribed 
for more than two years or only to students who are belowa certain standard at entrance. 
In more than half of these colleges the courses in physical education were prescribed 
later-than the year 1900. 
The standing of these courses in the college curriculum is shown by the fact that 
positive credit toward the bachelor’s degree is given in 58 per cent of the colleges 
and the students are marked for proficiency as in other courses in 63 per cent of the 
institutions. 
Ninety-eight per cent of the colleges have gymnasium facilities, 96 per cent have 
athletic fields, and 37 per cent have swimming pools. 
The academic standing of the directors of physical education in colleges is steadily 
increasing. Seventy-six per cent have seats in the faculty, 25 per cent have the title 
of professor, and out of 58 per cent who have the title of director of the gymnasium or 
physical director many have professional rank. 
There are no recent figures on the present status of physical education in private 
secondary schools. Nearly all have some form of physical education and many of 
them have a well-organized department in charge of a competent director. 
Dr. Gulick has secured valuable statistics showing the status of physical education 
in normal schools, public high and elementary schools.
-P-A-G-E-259
  
EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATIONS, CONFERENCES, ETC. 239 
Seventy-six per cent of the normal schools have regular instruction in gymnastics 
and 43 per cent in athletics. Courses in gymnastics are prescribed in 68 per cent. of 
the normal schools, and 48 per cent give credit for these courses. 
In the public high schools only 8 per cent offer regular instruction in gymnastics, 
5 per cent prescribe this work, and only 3 per cent give academic credit for it. 
The figures for public high and elementary schools show a very small percentage 
of schools with regular instruction in physical education, but that is due to the very 
large proportion of small rural schools included in the compilation. General obser- 
vation would lead one to believe that the majority of schools in cities of 10,000 
population or more have some form of regular instruction in physical education.    
    
     
    
   
                                              
          Many valuable papers were read. The association at this meeting 
recognized the physical director as an administrator. The larger 
part of the program of the convention was given over to the discus- 
sion of this topic. i 
AMERICAN INSTRUCTORS OF THE DEAF. 
The nineteenth convention of American Instructors of the Deaf 
was held at Delavan, Wis., July 6-13, 1911. The various papers and 
conferences dealt with “the basic conceptions of education in its 
relationships to life preparation, to life ideals, and to democracy.” 
The literary and industrial curricula of the school for the deaf, the 
subjects to be taught, and the pedagogic process were considered at 
length. Papers were read on kindergarten methods, art work, 
physical culture, moral and religious training, and preparation for 
Gallaudet College. Dr. A. L. E. Crouter, in his paper on ‘The pos- 
sibilities of oral methods in the instruction of deaf children,” laid 
stress on the necessity of the careful development of speech and lip 
reading during the first years of the deaf child’s training, and for the 
cultivation of these acquisitions during his entire school life. He 
said in part: : 
I have witnessed the complete success of such efforts with all classes of pupils so 
often that I am fully persuaded that the acquisition of intelligible speech and good 
practical, not to say expert, lip reading is well within the powers of our average pupils. 
Ihave conversed with pupils fully 50 feet away in a very satisfactory manner and upon 
a variety of topics. I have conducted chapel service times without number, speaking 
to 150 to 180 pupils at a time on moral and religious subjects with ample proof that I 
was intelligently understood by the majority of my audience. Indeed, from fre- 
quent experiences of this character, I am led to believe that with proper training and 
under favorable conditions the future will witness results of this nature little dreamed 
lof at thistime. * * * 
It is a striking proof of the advantage gained by presenting language through speech 
nd lip reading that oral classes make as much progress in language during their first 
years in school as was formerly made under manual methods, notwithstanding the 
‘ime spent on articulation drill. * * * 
After an experience of a good many years, covering all phases of the work, I am con- 
inced that there are few deaf children—not more than 2 or 3 per cent of average 
‘apacity—who are not able, under careful, skillful training, to acquire sufficient 
peech and lip reading for all classroom work and for general purposes of communica- 
ion outside the classroom.

  240 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
Indeed, I have come te the conclusion, after careful observation of results, that a 
deaf child that can not thus be instructed can not be instructed at all. 
The speaker added that when the born deaf are educated under 
oral methods, we usually find among them— 
a very large number of cases of highly satisfactory development, while of the adven- 
titious deaf (pupils deaf irom two to four years), the semideaf, and the semimutes, 
constituting fully 66 per cent of the pupilage at the Pennsylvania School, there are 
almost no cases of absolute failure to acquire a good, intelligible command of speech 
and lip reading. 
CATHOLIC EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
The seventh annual meeting of the Catholic Educational Associa- 
tion of the United States was held at Detroit, Mich., July 4-7, 1910. 
Delegates were present from all the States and from the Dominion of 
Canada. The papers read at this convention dealt largely with sub- 
jects of a practical character. Resolutions were passed urging the 
pastors of the Catholic Church in the United States ‘‘to interest them- 
selves more and more seriously and actively and constantly in the 
Catholic institutions of secondary and higher education.” 
Industrial training was discussed at length. Rev. H. C. Boyle 
remarked: 
Either we must equip industrial centers of cur own in the large cities at very con- 
siderable expense, or we must move for the admission of our parish-school children to 
the public-school centers already established. Some of the best industrial schools 
abroad are conducted under Cathoiic auspices—that of the Christien Brothers in the 
Rue de Vaugirard, Paris, is a notable example. * * * It is no strange work to 
which we are asked to set ourselves, but we are asked to undertake it under strange 
and unusual conditions. Shall we do it? is the question that presses for an answer. 
Or shall we take advantage of the public industrial schools, our schools, too, that are 
springing up with such astonishing rapidity in every city and town from Maine to 
California? 
Officers for the year 1910-11 are: President general, Right Rey. 
Mer. T. 3. Shahan, Washington, D. C.; secretary general, Rev. 
Francis W. Howard, Philadelphia, Pa. 
- The eighth annual convention of the Catholic Educational Asso- 
ciation was held in Chicago June 25-29, 1911. The report of the 
committee on secondary education was read by the Very Rev. James 
3. Burns. The present status of Catholic secondary education in the 
United States was set forth with the aid of statistics collected by the 
committee, and ‘‘the means for the development of a system of cen- 
tral Catholic high schools were enthusiastically considered.’”’ A reso- 
lution was passed by the association recognizing and approving of the 
Catholic high-school movement. The parish-school department, in 
one of its resolutions, made the following statement: 
  We desire to emphas' ne fact that the aim of elementary education is discipline— 
the training of the will to habits of virtue, study, and industry. We protest against 
any tendency to replace it by seeking to procure in the first place mere information 
or mere manual cr mental efficiency.

CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION IN THE SOUTH. 
The fourteenth Conference for Education in the South was held at 
Jacksonville, Fla., April 19-21, 1911. Mr. Robert C. Ogden, of New 
York, president of the conference, delivered an address outlining the 
purposes of the meeting. In regard to the educational conditions 
in the South he said: 
The most important advance recently made is the appointment, attached to the 
State office of education, of supervisors of rural schools. This work has been started 
in all save two of the Southern States. It required an open mind, a vivid imagination, 
and high constructive leadership to conceive and to execute this plan. The quarterly 
reports from these supervisors read like apostolic enthusiasm in their expressions of 
hopeful earnestness. They include the visitation of summer schools for teachers, 
conferences with county superintendents that should reveal the attitude of each of 
them toward educational progress, methods of supervision, systems of records, con- 
solidation of schools, and local taxation. Then meetings were called by county super- 
intendents of school trustees for discussion of rural school conditions and problems 
covering the whole range of school buildings, teaching, transportation of scholars, and 
consolidation. The farm-demonstration education has been going on without pause 
on the farms and in the boys’ corn clubs. The professors of secondary education have 
been diligently at work on the high-school problems with varying success but always 
with progress. The school-i -improvement leagues are combining their engiesny 
labors. The crusade for the local tax is fully maintained. 
All the foregoing items have direct relation with and are supported by the General 
Education Board or the Southern Education Board, thus having a close community 
of interest with this conference and therefore are entitled to consideration. 
President E. C. Branson, of the Georgia State Normal School at 
Athens, discussed “The condition of farm life in some Southern 
States.” The speaker made the point that the culture of the farmers 
was more important than the form of agriculture. He said: 
We have been brought to realize keenly that country life is menaced by (1) the 
accelerated growth of cities and the dwindling ratio of country dwellers, (2) farm 
tenancy, (3) the meager share of the farmer in the wealth he creates, and (4) the iso- 
lation of life in the farm regions. In brief, like other nations of the world, we are 
undergoing transformation from an agricultural to an industrial civilization, and we 
have been ill conditioned for the change. The farm has been sacrificed to the indus- 
trial growth of the country. And this is true in England. Denmark, Holland, New 
Zealand, and Germany have been wiser. Their Governments have become gigantic 
institutions for the promotion of national well-being; gigantic business concerns based 
on cooperative principles. In all of them the relation of agriculture to the general 
welfare is legislatively recognized, and farm life is promoted and protected. They 
are wise enough to know that rural decay involves national disaster: 
Our own statesmen need to be reminded that farming is still the biggest business 
in the United States; that the capital invested in it is greater than the capital invested 
in railroads or manufacture; that it is, indeed, nearly four-fifths as great as their com- 
bined capital. 
President Branson declared that the defenses of country life are 
(1) improved public highways, good schools, and good churches; (2) 
better methods in agriculture, better business, and better living on

the farm; (3) ofganization and cooperative enterprise among the 
farmers; and (4) a sympathetic federation of rural-life forces. 
Dr. Paul Ritter, envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary 
from the Republic of Switzerland, delivered an address on “The 
adaptation of education to life in Switzerland.” 
Count Carl Moltke, envoy extraordinary and minister plenipo- 
tentiary from the Kingdom of Denmark, spoke upon the methods of 
education in Denmark. 
Dr. John C. Bay, of Chicago, read a paper on “The folk high 
school and rural life of the Scandinavian countries.” 
Dr. J. N. Hurty, of the Indiana State Board of Health, spoke on 
“The child in the making.” Among other things he called attention 
to ‘the inalienable right of the child to be born free from defects, 
free from disease, and with pure blood.” To secure this right, 
society should see to it that the diseased, the defective, and those of 
impure blood should not have children. He said: 
Acquired defects must be removed early in the child’s life, or corrected when 
removal is not possible. Sickness and disease must be prevented, and to fail to accom- 
plish this when it is so clearly within our power marks us as delinquent. The child 
should receive a generous education, and be trained morally both by parent and by 
the State. 
The paper by Mr. Clarence Poe, editor of The Progressive Farmer, 
Raleigh, N. C., on “Asia’s greatest lesson for the South,” presented 
a graphic contrast between the industrial conditions of the Orient 
and the Occident. He said: > 
The prosperity of every man depends upon the prosperity (and therefore upon the 
efficiency) of the average man. The welfare of every individual depends upon the 
uplift of the great masses of the people. The most impressive fact that I discovered | 
in all my trip through the Orient was the fundamental world-wide importance of this 
too little accepted economic doctrine. It is the biggest lesson that the Old World 
has for the new. The South especially has been too slow to accept it—and has paid 
the penalty of its delay in a tragically belated development. 
The third day’s session was devoted to the annual meeting of the 
Southern State Superintendents’ Association, which always meets in 
conjunction with the conference. A brief summary of the progress 
of education in the South during the year was presented by Mr. J. N. 
Powers, secretary. 
The annual meeting of School Improvement Workers was also held 
in connection with the conference. 
LAKE MOHONK CONFERENCE OF FRIENDS OF THE INDIAN AND OTHER 
DEPENDENT PEOPLES. 
The twenty-eighth annual meeting was held at the Lake Mohonk 
Mountain House, October 19-21, 1910. The topics discussed included 
affairs among the Indians and in the Philippines, Porto Rico, Hawaii,
-P-A-G-E-263
  
EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATIONS, CONFERENCES, ETC. 243 
and Guam, recognizing, however, that the peoples of some of these 
regions can not be classed as ‘‘dependent peoples.” 
The president of the conference, Dr. Elmer Ellsworth Brown, in his 
closing address, summed up the salient features of the meeting. 
Speaking of the Indian, he said: 
So far as the Indian is concerned this twenty-eighth conference has reiterated the 
demand for a steady movement away from the tribal reservation system to the indi- 
vidual citizen system, with separate holdings, taxes, and all the rest. The most 
significant single thing done in that direction this week has undoubtedly been the 
reception of the report on the New York reservations presented by the strong com- 
mittee that was named by this conference a year ago, together with the appointment 
of an additional committee to carry into effect the intent of this report. The end 
in view is the closing out of the reservations, and the allotment of lands in severalty 
to their occupants. 
The first step toward that end is really to determine what is the legal situation of 
these reservations at the present time, and what legislation is necessary to bring about 
their dissolution. That step the new committee is expected to take by enlisting 
the activity of both State and National authorities. 
The Commissioner of Indian Affairs has given us some significant glimpses of the 
Indian Service in its practical working. 
As regards the Philippines, there has appeared an unmistakable sense of uneasiness, 
a fear that the development of the islands may get in ahead of the development of 
the islanders. The difficulties and perplexities of the situation have been clearly 
shown by several speakers, notably by the former secretary of education in these 
islands. No part of the program of this meeting, I am sure, has commanded greater 
interest than the series of impressive papers on Philippine subjects. In sounding 
its note of warning against the spirit of exploitation in the Far East, the conference 
has lent new emphasis to its declarations of other years, its declarations concerning 
the Indians and all other dependent peoples, that the first place in the American 
program is to be given to helping the backward people to self-help and self-govern- 
ment, and that even commercial ambition must pause a little to give right of way 
to this finer Americanism. 
The following resolutions were passed: 
Resolved, That in any reorganization of the Territorial government of Alaska, pro- 
vision should be made for educational service among the Alaskan natives on a plan 
at least as generous and effective as that now in operation. 
Resolved, That this conference regards with favor the movement to organize a 
society for promoting public familiarity with Philippine affairs. 
NATIONAL CONFERENCE ON VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE. 
The first National Conference on Vocational Guidance, called by 
the Boston Chamber of Commerce and the Vocation Bureau of Bos- 
ton, was held in Boston, November 15 and 16, 1910. Forty-five 
cities sent delegates, and great interest was evinced in the meetings. 
Manufacturers, workmen, business men, social workers, and edu- 
cators participated in the discussions. President Bernard J. Roth- 
well, of the chamber of commerce, expressed the interest of the 
business man in the subject of expert vocational counseling at the 
critical period before boys and girls leave school for work.

         Prof. Paul H. Hanus, head of the department of education in Har- 
vard University, outlined the basic principles on which proper 
vocational guidance must rest. He said: 
One large aim in vocational guidance is to develop the methods and material by 
which the public schools may help fit their individual graduates for the work they 
are likely to do, and in this effort to use all the spiritual, economic, educational, 
and other agencies which may cooperate to bring about the fullest information and 
the best suggestions. 
He deprecated the prescribing of vocations, and— 
the curtailing of the child’s privilege to enjoy the most liberal opportunities for 
growth and happiness that the schools can provide. * * * Nevertheless, it has 
become necessary to face the future problems of thousands of boys and girls who 
must leave school at 14, and the time has come for the establishment of a service 
that would help parent, teacher, and child in wisely planning for a life work, and for 
making demands upon commerce and industry in the direction of a better investment 
of youth’s powers in the field of wage earning. 
President Emeritus Eliot, of Harvard, spoke on the adjustment 
required in the common-school education to stimulate the life-career 
motive. 
The activities of vocational guidance, as outlined at the conference, 
fall into four general groups: 
First, giving information about vocations in general and about the 
opportunities for work in the immediate vicinity, and also about 
opportunities for receiving vocational education. 
The second group relates to children, when it is necessary to make 
the transition from school to work, and advising as to the importance 
of wise choice between temporary employment, however remunera- 
tive, and positions which offer opportunity for advancement. 
The third group relates to the guidance and sympathetic counsel- 
ing of the young worker subsequent to his entry into his new duties. 
A fourth group looks to the establishment of vocation bureaus 
for the collection of information about opportunities for boys and 
girls in the trades and stores, as well as the provision for vocational 
training, and the classification of this information in forms available 
for ready reference. 
' The opinion was generally expressed that ultimately this function 
should be taken over by the public schools. The Boston schools, 
it was stated, have now at least one vocational adviser in each of the 
elementary and high schools. 
Addresses were made by Prof. Felix Adler, who spoke on the 
ethical and economic implications of vocational guidance; Dr. David 
Snedden, Prof. Charles Zueblin, Samuel McCune Lindsay, and Dr. 
Richard C. Maclaurin, president of the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology. Dr. Maclaurin said: 
Vocational guidance, as I see it, is to be of inestimable value because it will dis- 
close what we need in vocational schools. We must make modern industry a part

of the liberal education, so as to give it a basis for vocational choice. Vocational 
guidance will react on all our educational systems, the industrial quite as much as 
the nonindustrial, 
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF MANUFACTURERS. 
The sixteenth annual meeting was held in New York, May 15-17, 
1911. A report was presented by the committee on industrial edu- : 
cation, the members of which were: Mr. H. E. Miles (chairman), Mr. 
John L. Ketcham, Mr. Anthony Ittner, Mr. Milton P. Higgins, and 
Mr. E. F. DuBrul. After outlining the changes that have taken 
place in industrial and social conditions in the United States, the re- 
port calls attention to the fact that— 
Almost all of the children who enter the industries enter at the age of 14. The work- 
ing people of the country who wish their children to enter the industries take them out 
of school at 14, knowing from experience that if they stay in school until 16 they will 
have passed the psychological time when industry beckons—will have acquired other 
tastes, and will never enter the industries. The American-born mechanic, then, is 
the boy who entered the shop at 14, grown up. Therefore, as good citizens and as em- 
ployers, it is for us to give especial consideration to the educational problem as it con- 
cerns children of 14 to 16. a 
As stated in the report of the Wisconsin Bureau of Labor for 1910, only 12 per cent 
of the children employed under 16 years of age are in position to learn a trade. Of the 
remainder, a great proportion are employed at such simple routine tasks as are detri- 
mental to both mind and character. The great body of those who enter the cursory 
occupations become newsboys, errand boys, etc. When these boys reach maturity 
and have the aspirations of men, their occupations have made them unfit for the better 
work of the trades. 
The report discusses how Germany and other countries have at- 
tacked the problem of industrial education. It says: 
Germany apparently prefers that the great body of her children shall enter the in- 
dustries at 14. The point is that the state goes into the industry with the child; the 
hand of the child is kept within the hand of the state; the child is led and directed 
continuously from the time of his entrance into the industry at 14 until his seventeenth 
or eighteenth year. Instructors watch the work of the child in the factory, and, upon 
compulsion of law, every child goes back to the school from the factory for a period of 
from 7 to 10 hours per week. The school to which he goes is the industrial school, there 
called the continuation school, for in this school the education of the child worker is 
“‘continued.’’ The shop practice of every trade is secured in the factory. 
The small, almost inconsiderable, investment in apparatus, the dependence upon 
the factories for practice and machinery, enable the German industrial school to teach 
as many industries as are represented in the several communities. Each school teaches 
many industries, so that the children of each community become skilled employees in 
the various industrial institutions of that community; and, per contra, every home in- 
dustry finds skilled, capable, and willing employees in the children of its community. 
The American trade school, as primarily conceived, made a great investment in ma- 
chinery and plant. It was impossible to teach all occupations, for that would require 
as many plants as there are industries in each community. Our trade schools have 
therefore for the most part confined themselves to four occupations only—woodwork- 
ing, bricklaying, plumbing, and metal working. In Germany every trade is taught. 
Wurttemburg, Germany, for instance, has a population less by one-fourth of a million

persons than the State of Wisconsin. It is ‘‘on thewhole a poor, hilly country, with 
very poor transportation facilities.’ ‘It has, besides its splendid system of elementary 
and secondary schools, about 250 industrial schools in its towns and villages.” 
The single city of Munich, Bavaria, has about 47 of these industrial schools.  Con- 
trast the city of Milwaukee, which is about the same size, with its one trade school, rep- 
resenting a great investment, teaching only the four occupations above named, and to 
only half as many students as it was planned to accommodate. These schools of 
Munich are maintained at marvelously little expense per student, and teach all the 
trades of Munich, including the following, for instance: Book printer and typesetter, 
lithographer, photographer and zinc-plate worker, stucco worker or ornamental sculp- 
tor, tinsmith, bather, wig maker, baker, hotel keeper (including hotel carving), wood 
carver, jeweler, gold and silver worker, merchant, confectioner, pastry cook, butcher, 
tailor, clerk and office assistant, shoemaker, turner, druggist, glazier, chimney sweep, 
coachman, saddler and trunk maker, cooper, lockmaker, upholsterer and decorator, 
potter and stove builder, watchmaker, wheelwright. By what right does an American 
community take the money of the whole community and use it only for those children 
who wish to enter the four trades here occasionally taught, and fail to educate the chil- 
dren who select other occupations? How can a community justify itself in raising the 
standards of four trades only and forgetting the dozens of other trades? If the system 
is right it must be applied to all; if it is not right it should be applied to none. 
In conclusion, the committee particularly emphasizes— 
the fact that none of its findings are to be taken as prejudicial to any of the existing 
methods of industrial education. There are private shop schools here and there, like 
those of the General Electric Co., the International Harvester Co., and the Baldwin 
Locomotive Works. There are expensive trade schools like the Milwaukee, with a 
high cost and a small attendance; and better, the Worcester Trade School, which is 
both a full-time school, where about 115 pupils are given continuous all-day instruc- 
tion, a continuation school for another class of boys who are instructed for one day in 
the week, and an evening school for those who can only avail themselves of its privi- 
leges after the day’s work. The Cincinnati system is, in most respects, a continuation 
school with two sets of boys alternating, each having a week in the shop and then a 
week in the school. The Cincinnati University similarly requires only alternate 
weeks of the student’s time, the other weeks being devoted to the shop. It gives the 
highest sort of engineering and polytechnic training at from one-third to one-half the 
expense of the old-time polytechnic institute. All these and other schools are an in- 
finite blessing to such of our youth as are there accommodated. Without these begin- 
nings of a complete, well-digested national system we would be benighted indeed. 
Out of them and the present widespread study of the problem will soon come the 
complete national system which will do for all of our industrial youth what the old 
common-school system is made to do along cultural lines only. 
The time is ripe for action. When the American people really awaken to a great 
public need they usually act quickly. Massachusetts has made a great start. Wis- 
consin is likely to establish at once the continental system, splendidly Americanized 
and adapted. Cities, towns, and associations are acting independently. Our chil- 
dren can neither stand still nor wait. The procedure is simple; action should be 
immediate. 
The association passed a resolution favoring “the establishment 
in every community of continuation schools, wherein the children of 
14 to 18 years of age now in the industries shall be instructed in the 
science and art of their respective industries and in citizenship.”

NATIONAL SOCIETY FOR THE PROMOTION OF INDUSTRIAL 
EDUCATION. 
The fourth annual convention was held in Boston, November 17- 
19, 1910. There were seven sessions, exclusive of the business 
meeting, at which many notable papers were read. The first session 
was devoted to the consideration of the “‘Demands and opportuni- 
ties for girls in trades and stores;” the second session, to ‘The 
training of teachers for girls’ trade schools.” At the banquet, the 
third session, emphasis was laid on the boy to be trained quite as 
much as on the industry to be served by a system of industrial edu- 
cation. Mr. Charles H. Winslow, representative of the American 
Federation of Labor, stated the position of organized labor. The 
fourth session was given over to a discussion of ‘Apprenticeship and 
corporation schools.” Mr. G. M. Basford, summarizing the move- 
ment for such schools, said: 
People are beginning to understand that the industrial progress of Germany is not 
due to her superior technical educational methods so much as it is due to her con- 
sistent adherence to apprenticeship. Technical education has done much in Ger- 
many, but without the substructure of workmen skilled through apprenticeship the 
education would not have brought that country to its present position. We now 
know that Germany does not depend upon trade schools, as we understand the term, 
but upon apprenticeship, upon continuation and improvement schools, for skilled and 
intelligent workmen. These continuation schools are attended by apprentices, and 
the improvement schools by those who have completed apprenticeship. 
We need skilled workmen who understand their work and its relations to the work 
of others, and who are prepared in citizenship to take their places in the organization 
of human life. To supply the need we must train the hands and the minds of our 
recruits. The present emergency seems to compel us to take the school to the boy for 
the training of the mind. Our greatest work is in the shop. The boy is in the shop 
and we must move the school to him, for we can not move him to the school. Wecan 
not wait for the educators to adapt themselves to our problem, but must take it in hand 
ourselves—hence the corporation school. Whether or not the corporation school is 
permanent is a question which may be safely left to the future. At present it meets 
an urgent need and will meet it until cooperation with public schools may be effected. 
It is perfectly safe to accept the proposition that apprenticeship is to be a permanent- 
factor as an American institution. By this is meant the new apprenticeship, involv- 
ing real shoptraining by men who have direct responsibility for teaching trades, and 
have time for this work because they have nothing else todo. Trade schools, unless 
followed by apprenticeship, do not and I believe can not, meet the industrial need of 
the times. Advocates of trade schools do not claim that complete preparation for 
trades may be given in such schools. The boy from the trade school needs apprentice- 
ship for two reasons: First, to provide for his entrance into a manufacturing organi- 
zation, and, second, to complete his trade training. The need is so great as to justify 
encouragement of every possible method of providing relief. It is, however, signifi- 
cant that the number of authorities on this subject who believe that real apprentice- 
ship is the only method of teaching trades is rapidly increasing.

248 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
The fifth session was devoted to ‘‘Part time and evening schools.” 
At the sixth session Dr. Georg Kerschensteiner, superintendent of 
schools, Munich, Bavaria, spoke on the Munich system of industrial 
continuation schools. 
The last session was occupied with the consideration of the social 
meaning of industrial education. 
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE STUDY AND EDUCATION OF EXCEP- 
TIONAL CHILDREN. 
The National Association for the Study and Education of Excep- 
tional Children held its annual meeting in New York City, April 29, 
1911. Dr. Franz J. A. Torek, president, presented a report, calling 
attention to the fact, among other matters, that Dr. Maximilian 
P. E. Groszmann, educational director of the association, had begun 
to take the initial steps for what is termed field work, by suggesting 
a series of intelligence tests in the public-school systems of Plain- 
field, N. J., and near-by communities. Dr. Groszmann reported 
interesting and encouraging developments during the past year, his 
own work being more than ever devoted to the research side of 
problems relating to exceptional children, and to the building up of 
a central information bureau and reference library at the Institute 
for Atypical Children, at Plainfield, N. J., which is conducted under 
the auspices of the national association. 
NATIONAL LEAGUE OF COMPULSORY EDUCATION OFFICERS. 
The first annual convention of the league was held in Chicago 
June 2-3, 1911. The object of the organization is to bring about a 
spirit of cooperation among the heads of compulsory education 
departments throughout the country and to work for uniform com- 
pulsory education laws in each State. The meetings are held for the 
purpose of general discussion of the causes of truancy, the prevention 
and handling of truancy cases, and of a national organization for the 
promotion of school attendance throughout the country. 
SOCIAL CENTER CONFERENCE. 
The first Social Center Conference met at Dallas, Tex., February 
17, 1911, in response to a call issued by Col. Frank P. Holland. 
The sessions were devoted to the study of the civic, social, and 
recreational problems of rural communities and the best methods of 
developing the use of the country schoolhouses as a means of meeting 
them, and the needs of the cities of the Southwest.

TERRITORIAL TEACHERS ASSOCIATION OF HAWAITL. 
The Territorial Teachers Association of Hawaii has a long and 
creditable record and has been a potent factor in raising the ideals of 
service of the teaching profession of Hawaii. 
The association consists of a central organization in Honolulu, with 
branch organizations upon each of the other islands. Any teacher of 
the public or private schools is eligible to membership. There are no 
dues nor fees. The officers consist of a president, vice president, and 
secretary, elected annually. The officers for 1910-11 were Mr. J. C. 
Davis, Miss Ida Ziegler, Mr. Vaughan MacCaughey, of the College of 
Hawaii. An advisory council, consisting of principals of the larger 
schools, assists in planning programs and other executive work of the 
association. Meetings are held monthly, usually in the auditorium 
of the McKinley High School. 
The association expressed its approval of the following plan for 
industrial education in the Territory: 
On each of the four islands, Kauai, Oahu, Maui, and Hawaii, schools shall be estab- 
lished contiguous to important centers of industry. These schools shall give training 
in agriculture, home economics, trades, and industries. Instruction shall be given 
in field, garden, kitchen, and shop and shall be of such practical nature as to enable 
the pupils at the end of the course to take up work in the respective industries at 
remunerative wages. 
The type school for such a system is as follows: A school shall be established in a 
given locality when 25 students can be assured. The attendance of all boys and girls 
between the ages of 14 and 18, both inclusive, who are not otherwise wisely and profit- 
ably employed, shall be required. The equipment of the school shall consist of a

boys attending, at the rate of 24 acres per boy; all essential hand tools; a shop equip- 
ment to meet the needs of the industries of the neighborhood, and residence buildings

           The fiftieth anniversary of the granting of the charter of the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology was celebrated on April 10, 
1911. Asa fitting memorial of the occasion a congress of technology 
was arranged. President R. C. Maclaurin announced the gift of a 
member of the class of 93, who had purchased and presented to the 
institute about 1,000 acres of land in Maine to be used for the summer 
school of civil engineering. On the afternoon of April 10, President 
Maclaurin delivered an address on ‘‘Some factors in the institute’s 
success.” He emphasized the fact that— 
there has never been any uncertainty or indefiniteness as to what the institute is 
aiming at in its scheme of education. Every serious student of education is struck 
by the fact that so many schools and colleges drift around, apparently without com- 
pass or rudder, with no definite idea as to what port they are trying to reach, or how 
they should go to reach it. Here, at any rate, is an institution that, from the very 
outset, has had very definite ideas on these matters, whether those ideas be right 
or wrong. 
He sketched briefly the career of President William B. Rogers, who, 
in his first address to the students, spoke of the value and the dignity 
of the practical professions for which they were to prepare them- 
selves. President Maclaurin’s address was followed by a paper on 
“The spirit of alchemy in modern industry,” by Dr. William H. 
Walker, director of the research laboratory of applied chemistry; and 
by one on “Technology and the public health,” by Prof. C. E. A. 
Winslow, associate professor of biology, College of the City of New 
York. 
The papers delivered on the second day of the congress were 
divided as follows: Section A—Scientific investigation and control of 
industrial processes, under the direction of Prof. William H. Walker, 
chairman; Section B—Technological education in its relations to 
industrial development, in charge of Dr. A. A. Noyes, chairman; 
Section C—Administration and management, in charge of Dr. Davis 
R. Dewey, chairman; Section D—Recent industrial development, in 
charge of Prof. D. C. Jackson, chairman; Section E—Public health 
and sanitation, in charge of Prof. W. T. Sedgwick, chairman; Sec- 
tion F—Architecture, in charge of Prof. F. W. Chandler, chairman. 
Prof. C. F. Park had general supervision of the congress.

UNIVERSITY OF WYOMING. 
The twenty-fifth anniversary of the University of Wyoming was 
held June 10-15, 1911. Among other features was the presentation 
of an alumni play, written and performed by alumni, entitled “The 
Promised Land.” It was a portrayal of several phases of Wyoming 
and. university life. 
VASSAR COLLEGE. 
The fiftieth anniversary of the founding of Vassar College was cele- 
brated April 28-29, 1911. President Taylor delivered an address of 
welcome to the visiting delegates. An interesting feature of the 
exercises was a pageant representing women of culture in five ages: 
Among the speakers were Miss Julia Lovejoy, for the students’ associa- 
tion; Mrs. Mary King Babbitt, for the alumnez; Prof. Laura J. Wylie, 
for the faculty; and President Taylor, who discussed ‘‘The Founder 
and the College.” 
INAUGURATION OF UNIVERSITY PRESIDENTS. 
UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT. 
The first of a series of inaugurations which marked the opening of 
the fall session of the scholastic year 1911-12 was that of Guy Potter 
Benton, A. M., D. D., LL. D., as president of the University of Ver- 
mont. The inaugural ceremony, which occurred October 6, had been 
preceded by an educational conference at the university, and many 
members of the conference remained for the inauguration. The 
ceremony drew together a large concourse of special delegates from 
the principal colleges and universities of this country and Canada, 
including the presidents of no less than 15 institutions. The keys 
and seal of the university were delivered to the new president by Mr. 
Darwin P. Kingsley, on behalf of the university’s board of trustees. 
Mr. Kingsley briefly reviewed the history of the institution from the 
inception of the idea in 1777 to its realization in 1800, and the admin- 
istrations which have preceded that of Dr. Benton, who is the twelfth 
president of the university. He recalled in particular the presidency 
of Dr. James B. Angell from 1866 to 1871, the large statesmanship of 
Justin S. Morrill, a firm friend of the institution, and the unsurpassed 
service of Dr. Matthew H. Buckham, whose recent death ended an 
administration covering more than a quarter of a ceritury. 
The subject of President Benton’s address was “Education and 
the State,” and his discussion indicated that liberal conception of 
this relation natural to one long identified with educational move- 
ments in the Middle West. Dr. Benton came to his present position 
from Miami University, Oxford, Ohio, which he had administered 
with marked success since 1902.
-P-A-G-E-272
  252 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
A large number of honorary degrees were conferred in connection. 
with the inaugural exercises, among the recipients being, in addition 
to a number of college presidents and eminent professors, Dr. Harvey 
W. Wiley, Chief of the Bureau of Chemistry of the United States 
Department of Agriculture; Gov. John A. Mead, of Vermont; and 
Dr. A. E. Winship, editor of the Journal of Education. 
UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA. 
The inauguration of George Edgar Vincent, Ph. D., LL. D., as 
president of the University of Minnesota, took place on October 18, 
1911. The chief addresses were devoted to ‘The leading ideas of 
higher education—culture, vocation, research, and service—and 
were delivered by Presidents A. R. Hill, J. H. Finley, H. P. Judson, 
and C. R. Van Hise. 
The inaugural address of President Vincent laid great stress on 
cooperation, organization, and team play as the keynotes for the 
coming years of the university, whose campus must be as wide as 
the boundaries of the State, and whose one great aim must be “‘to 
find exceptional men and women, to train them for service, to fit 
_ them for leadership, to fill them with zeal for truth and justice.” 
An impressive feature of the ceremonies, notable for the rare 
combination of dignity and enthusiasm, was the participation of the 
two preceding presidents, William W. Folwell and Cyrus Northrop, 
the former speaking for the faculty and the latter presenting the new 
president for installation. 
= BOSTON UNIVERSITY. 
The third president of Boston University, Lemuel Herbert Mur- 
lin, D. D., LL. D., formerly president of Baker University, Baldwin, 
Kans., was inaugurated with elaborate ceremony October 26 in the 
presence of a large concourse of people, including chosen delegates 
from above 100 American and foreign universities and colleges and 
from many learned societies. Ex-Gov. Bates, of Massachusetts, who, 
as president of the university corporation, presented its seal and char- 
ter. to the incoming president, emphasized in his address the distin- 
guishing characteristics of this institution, its progressive and 
cosmopolitan spirit and deep religious motive, which pass as a 
sacred trust to the new administration. 
The subject: of President Murlin’s inaugural address was ‘‘The 
university and the city,” and its central idea was that of university 
leadership in the problem of our civilization, which, in the opinion) 
of the speaker, ‘‘is the problem of the city.” The significance of| 
this idea was emphasized by the presence and participation in the 
exercises of representatives of all the municipal activities of Boston| 
pertaining to education.

NEW YORK UNIVERSITY. 
The public installation of Elmer Ellsworth Brown, LL. D., former 
United States Commissioner of Education, as the seventh chancellor 
of New York University, occurred November 9, 1911, in the presence 
of a distinguished gathering of college men. There were present 
about 150 delegates, representing colleges, universities, and educa- 
tional institutions throughout this country and Europe. 
Among the more important addresses delivered during the day 
were the following: On behalf of the corporation, Hon. Eugene 
Stevenson, vice president of the council; inaugural, Dr. Elmer Ells- 
worth Brown, chancellor; congratulatory, Dr. Henry M. MacCracken, 
chancellor-emeritus; for the alumni, Dr. Henry Bond Eliot, senior 
alumnus, a graduate of the class of 1840. 
Responses were made by delegates as follows: For New York, Dr. 
Andrew S. Draper, State commissioner of education; for the city of 
New York, Hon. William J. Gaynor, mayor; for educational founda- 
tions, Dr. Elihu Root, trustee of the Carnegie Institution, senior 
United States Senator from New York; for American universities, 
Dr. Harry Pratt Judson, president of the University of Chicago; 
Dr. Edmund J. James, president of the University of Illinois; Dr. 
Mary E. Woolley, president of Mount Holyoke College; and Dr. James 
H. Kirkland, chancellor of Vanderbilt University; for foreign uni- 
versities, Dr. James Bryce, British ambassador, honorary fellow 
Oriel and Trinity Colleges, University of Oxford; Dr. Andrew Car- 
negie, lord rector of the University of Aberdeen; and Dr. William R. 
Riddell, justice of the King’s bench, member of the senate of the 
University of Toronto. 
In his address Chancellor Brown emphasized the intimate relation 
existing between the work of the New York University and the 
social, civic, industrial, professional, and cultural life of the city of 
New York, but claimed for the university in addition that broader 
contact with the world which it has constantly enjoyed. He ex- 
pressed an earnest desire to cooperate in every helpful way with the 
authorities of Columbia University and the College of the City of 
New York in advancing the cause of sound education both in the city 
and the nation. 
At a banquet at the Astor Hotel in the evening toasts were pro- 
posed by Rev. George Alexander, and responses were given by Dr. 
Paul H. Hanus for Harvard, President Arthur T. Hadley for Yale, 
Dr. William F. Magie for Princeton, President Nicholas Murray 
Butler for Columbia, and President Jacob G. Schurman for Cornell. 
Telegrams of congratulation were read from President Taft and from 
Dr. P. P. Claxton, United States Commissioner of Education.

WEST VIRGINIA UNIVERSITY. 
Dr. Thomas Edward Hodges was inaugurated as eighth president 
of West Virginia University November 3, 1911. The occasion was 
especially noteworthy on account of the presence of the President of 
the United States. Addresses were made by President Alderman, of 
the University of Virginia; President Judson, of Chicago University; 
President Thompson, of Ohio State University; President Hodges, of 
West Virginia University; and Dr. Fletcher B. Dresslar, of the United 
States Bureau of Education. The subject emphasized most by the 
speakers was’that of making the university of practical use to the 
State. Delegates were present from 50 educational institutions. 
THE INAUGURATION AT WELLESLEY COLLEGE. 
The inauguration of Miss Ellen Fitz Pendleton as the sixth presi- 
dent of Wellesley College was celebrated October 16 with impressive 
ceremony and in the presence of a notable company of educators 
and public officials. The invocation was pronounced by Rey. Wil- 
liam Lawrence, Episcopal bishop of Massachusetts and vice presi- 
dent of the college. Dr. Samuel B. Capen, president of the board 
of trustees, and Mrs. Pauline A. Durant, the surviving founder of the 
college, took part in the installation ceremony. Brief addresses on 
educational topics were made by President Lowell of Harvard, Presi- 
dent Faunce of Brown, President Taylor of Vassar, and President 
King of Oberlin. President Faunce, whose subject was the origin 
and growth of colleges for women, recalling that President Pendle- 
ton was a native of Rhode Island, said, ‘‘Our State has never boasted 
of its size; but we are quite large enough to furnish Massachusetts 
with one president of Mount Holyoke College and two presidents of 
Wellesley College within a dozen years.” 
President Pendleton is a graduate of the college over which she is 
now called to preside, and has already served it as professor, dean, 
and acting president, and is therefore fully possessed of its traditions 
and spirit. The subject of her inaugural address was the twofold 
function of a college—the training for citizenship, and the prepara- 
tion of the scholar. It was noticeable that among the essential fac- 
tors in such training she emphasized the claims of her.own specialty, 
mathematics, as regards both its disciplinary and cultural effects. 
A picturesque feature of the day’s events was the presentation of 
the delegates to President Pendleton by roll call, the delegates, over 
90 in number, being duly summoned in order of the founding of each 
institution represented. 
The brilliant social features of the occasion were completed by a 
reunion of the alumne.

ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES. 
The twelfth annual conference of the Association of American 
Universities was held at the University of Virginia November 10-11, 
1910. Dr. William L. Bryan, of Indiana University, presented a 
paper on “Combined courses in academic and professional work,’ H 
in which he declared— 
(1) The combined arts-professional courses are to be judged in comparison with 
other courses now offered in standard colleges of liberal arts; (2) the various types 
of combined course are attempts to hit the difficult mean between too early and too 
late entrance upon professional studies. There is substantial danger in both 
directions. 
Dr. Calvin Thomas, of Columbia University, read a paper on ‘‘The 
degree of master of arts.’ Among other things, he said: 
The master’s degree is not conferred exclusively by universities that are worthy 
of the name and can be trusted to maintain a high standard under a régime of perfect 
liberty. It is also conferred by a host of institutions which are not properly equipped 
for graduate work of a high grade, but would like to be thought thus equipped. As 
for the bachelor’s degree, it can now be had from all sorts of institutions, some of 
which are virtually high schools. If, then, in the country at large, we are to have 
no standard at all for the master’s degree, if it is to betoken nothing more definite 
than a year’s study following a bachelor’s degree, there is reason to fear that the 
second degree may gradually lose such prestige as it has now acquired at the better 
institutions and become a sort of academic joke. On the other hand, it is at least 
possible, and it seems reasonable to hope, that if our leading universities, as here 
represented, were to unite in a well-considered effort to give the degree a more definite 
significance their influence might gradually prevail over weaker competitors and 
ultimately establish the degree on a firm basis of public regard and public utility. 
President Charles R. Van Hise, of the University of Wisconsin, 
spoke on the subject of ‘‘The appointment and tenure of university 
professors.” Dr. Van Hise emphasized the fact that a difference 
must necessarily exist in methods employed in the western State 
universities and in the older endowed universities of the East. 
ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGES AND PREPARATORY SCHOOLS OF THE 
SOUTHERN STATES. 
The sixteenth annual meeting of the Association of Colleges and 
Preparatory Schools of the Southern States was held at Athens, Ga., 
November 3-4, 1910. Prof. R. E. Blackwell, of Randolph-Macon 
College, Virginia, delivered the presidential address, taking as his 
theme ‘The necessity for conservation of educational energy in the 
South.” He said: 
We need libraries, laboratories, high-priced teachers, and twice as many of them as 
formerly, whereas a comparatively short time ago neither libraries’nor laboratories 
made any demands on the treasuries of our colleges. Now, under the hampering 
conditions in the South, how are we going to make schools that measure up to the 
standard set by the wealthier portions of our country? It is only by the greatest 
economy of means that we can do it. We must conserve every ounce of educational 
energy. There must be no unnecessary duplication of instrumentalities, and no waste.
-P-A-G-E-276
    
256 _ EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
Looking at the situation in the South, what do we find? No well-articulated system 
of education—universities, colleges, and high schools all competing for the same grade 
of student. No university well enough equipped to do genuine research work, and 
twice as many professional and polytechnic schools as are needed, and none of them 
able to give our people the advantages that northern and western institutions offer. 
When we think of the heavy handicap of the South, it is simply disheartening to con- 
template our situation. 
Fortunately our people are beginning to be aroused to the actual state of affairs; 
public sentiment is being molded so that. those in authority are coming to see the 
necessity of some improvement. What we need is to get clearly before our minds that 
the money that we have is not for the purpose of supporting institutions of learning, 
but for the education of our young people. Loyalty to our children comes first; the 
good of individual institutions must be subordinated to the good of those who are to be 
taught. 
The first thing to be done is to complete the work of this association—to makea hard- 
and-fast line between high school and college so that there shall be no overlapping here. 
This would seem to be not so difficult a task, and yet those who have been wrestling 
with it know how much yet has tobedone. Strange to say, the State schools are among 
the most conspicuous sinners in this matter of educational overlapping and waste of 
energy. The State is building up high schools with one hand and with the other is 
appropriating money to institutions of college grade which devote much of that money 
to teaching high-school subjects, having induced students to leave the high school by 
offering them the liberty and the attractions of college life. 
Papers were read by Dr. W. D. Weatherford, Dr. R. H. Whitehead, 
and Dr. N. P. Colwell also. 
The report of the committee on uniform entrance examinations, 
appointed at the preceding meeting of the association, was submitted. 
The subject of the “Administration of the system of admission to 
college by certificate” was discussed at length, and a committee was 
appointed to consider the question of the certificating system and its 
administration, and to “suggest desirable safeguards for use by 
colleges, prepare blanks, and consider the advisability of establishing 
a permanent commission or board as a part of the organization of this 
association, and include in the scope of its inquiry and recommenda- 
tions such further matters as it may deem wise.” 
ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGIATE ALUMNZ. 
The twenty-ninth annual meeting was held October 19-22 at 
Denver, Colo. 
The committee, appointed to make out a list of approved foreign 
universities whose advanced nonprofessional degrees shall be accepted 
for membership in the association, reported that it was unable to 
formulate any fixed standards for the admission of such institutions. 
The committee limited its task in two directions: First, it consid- 
ered ‘only universities which already grant degrees to women, except 
in the case of Germany, where ‘the regulations in regard to women 
are frequently changed”; and second, it considered the universities 
of particular countries only—France, Switzerland, Germany, Great
-P-A-G-E-277
    UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES. 257 
Britain, Ireland, Canada, Scandinavia, Belgium, and Holland. The 
committee reported that it felt “‘quite incompetent to deal with the 
universities of the Latin countries, or of Russia, or of the Orient. 
Austria offers almost no privileges to women. The only countries on 
the list which offer an advanced nonprofessional degree other than 
the doctorate are Great Britain, Ireland, Canada, and France.” 
The officers of the association for 1910-11 are: President, Miss 
Laura Drake Gill, 264 Boylston Street, Boston, Mass.; secretary, 
Mrs. Philip N. Moore, 3125 Lafayette Avenue, St. Louis, Mo. 
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF STATE UNIVERSITIES. 
The fifteenth annual meeting of the association was held in Wash- 
ington, D. C., November 14, 1910. Dr. Brown Ayres, president of 
the University of Tennessee, delivered the presidential address. 
Speaking of extension work, he said: 
The idea has rapidly spread that a State university exists not solely as a teaching 
institution for the pupils within its walls, or even for its influence direct or remote on 
the schools of the State, but that its duty is to serve the State in all possible ways, 
whether in general or special education, in industries, in the investigation of economic 
problems, in the solution of the problems of public health, in the problems of the home, 
the town, or the city. 
Dr. W. O. Thompson, president of Ohio State University, read a 
paper on ‘‘In what sense and to what extent is freedom of teaching in 
State colleges and universities expedient and permissible?” in which 
he stated that— 
the freedom of teaching in State colleges and universities is not only expedient and 
permissible, but a necessity if the university is to reach its highest service. Moreover, 
this freedom will be exercised upon all proper subjects of human inquiry. 
Dr. Thomas F. Kane, of the University of Washington, delivered 
an address on “The maintenance of the college of liberal arts in a 
State university in competition with professional and technical 
colleges in the same institution.” Among other things he said: 
This is peculiarly a materialistic and practical age. The demand for preparation 
for a vocation is strong. The college of liberal arts, to render its most effective service 
and to appeal to men in the midst of the other colleges, must connect with life. The 
bearing of its courses as the broad foundation for vocational training should be kept 
clear at many points. The relation may well be kept clear, for examples, of the work 
in English to a department of journalism or a literary career or to public speaking, of 
the work in economics to a department of commerce, of the work in geology to the 
department of mining, of the work in chemistry to industrial chemistry and pharmacy, 
of the work in botany and zoology to economic botany and zoology, of the work in 
mathematics to engineering, of the work in German, French, and Spanish to inter- 
national diplomacy or foreign commerce, of the relation of history and political science 
to law and legislation, and the relation of the department of physics to electrical 
engineering. ‘This relation of the arts work makes its appeal to men. It tends to give 
the college its proper place with strong students, as the central college of the univer- 
18144°—np 1911—von 1——17 
 
-P-A-G-E-278
    
258 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
sity. All the strong students, regardless of vocation, need the liberal-arts training as 
men. From the vocational standpoint they need the liberal-arts training as the broad 
foundation to prepare for the greatest ultimate growth in their vocation of which they 
are capable. 
The definition of a “unit” adopted by the National Conference on 
Standards of Colleges and Secondary Schools was approved and 
adopted by the association. It is as follows: 
A unit represents a year’s study in any subject in a secondary school, constituting 
approximately a quarter of a full year’s work. 
The following explanation was appended by the committee on 
standards: 
This statement is designed to afford a standard of measurement for the work done in 
secondary schools. It takes the four-year high-school course as a basis, and assumes 
that the length of the school year is from 36 to 40 weeks, that a period is from 40 fo 60 
minutes in length, and that the study is pursued for 4 or. 5 periods a week; but under 
ordinary circumstances a satisfactory year’s work in any subject can not be accom- 
plished in less than 120 sixty-minute hours or their equivalent. Schools organized on 
any other than a four-year basis can, nevertheless, estimate their work in terms of 
this unit. 
NATIONAL CONFERENCE COMMITTEE ON STANDARDS OF COLLEGES 
AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
The fifth annual meeting of this committee was held in New York 
City, January 28, 1911. 
The following organizations were represented: National Associa- 
tion of State Universities, College Entrance Examination Board, 
New. England College Entrance Certificate Board, Association of 
Colleges and Preparatory Schools of the Middle States and Maryland, 
North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools, Asso- 
ciation of Colleges and Preparatory Schools of the Southern States, 
Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, New England 
Association of Colleges and Preparatory Schools, the United States 
Bureau of Education. 
Desirous of assisting in the establishment of “a uniform and con- 
venient terminology,” the committee had appointed a subcommittee 
to prepare for this conference data regarding the use of the terms 
“hour,” “count,” unit,” “period,” “exercise,” “point,” ete., in 
secondary schools and colleges. Mr. Wilson Farrand, chairman of 
the subcommittee, reported the results of the investigation which 
had been made and embodied these results in the following resolu- 
tion, which was unanimously adopted: 
Resolved, That this committee recommends, as a matter of convenience and to 
secure uniformity: 
1. That the term ‘‘unit” be used only as a measure of work done in secondary 
schools, and that the term “period” be used to denote a recitation (or equivalent 
exercise) in a secondary school.
-P-A-G-E-279
UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES. 259 
2. That the term ‘“‘hour” be restricted to use in measuring college work, and that 
the term “‘exercise” be used to denote a recitation, lecture, or laboratory period in a 
college. 
3. That ‘‘unit” be used as defined by this committee, the Carnegie Foundation, 
and the College Entrance Examination Board, and that ‘“‘hour” be used preferably 
in the sense of year-hour. 
4. That the use of other terms, such as “‘count,” “‘point,’’ ‘credit,’ etc., in any of 
these senses be discontinued. 
Following a discussion of the question of a combination of the 
examination and the certification methods of admission to college, 
Dean Ferry presented the following resolution, which was unani- 
mously adopted: 
Resolved, That this committee indorses the movement of various colleges in the 
direction of attaching weight to the school record of each candidate in connection 
with his entrance examination, and recommends to the colleges that such records be 
regularly used as an aid in determining the candidate’s fitness for admission to college. 
The question of the proper use of the term “honorable dismissal” 
was discussed and the secretary was requested to obtain further 
information on the subject and to report at the next meeting. 
Various questions proposed for discussion were laid on the table 
and the subcommittee, consisting of Headmaster Wilson Farrand, 
of Newark Academy, Newark; Principal Bliss, of the University 
School of Detroit; President Henry S. Pritchett, of the Carnegie 
Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching; and Dean Frederick 
C. Ferry, of Williams College, was continued with a request that it 
report again at the next meeting. 
NORTH CENTRAL ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGES AND SECONDARY 
SCHOOLS. 
The sixteenth annual meeting of this association was held in 
Chicago, Ill, March 24-25, 1911. Prof. George W. Benton, of 
Indianapolis, Ind., delivered an address on “Some problems of 
secondary education,” in which he called attention to four problems 
in organization and administration, as follows: 
(1) The elective system must be extended to meet the more varied needs of the 
growing constituency of our secondary schools, but election must have a definite 
purpose and must be controlled by wise and thoughtful consideration of the needs of 
the individual. (2) It is the business of public education to do what it can to render 
efficient every individual, according to his peculiar abilities. To that end his time 
must be conserved, and he must be brought by the most direct route to the par- 
ticular educational opportunity which will best utilize his powers and render them 
subservient to life’s serious purposes. We must avoid trying to spoil a workman in 
the effort to make a scholar, or the reverse. (3) Colleges must either assist the sec- 
ondary school in maintaining standards of efficiency, or they must liberalize their 
estimate of the quality of secondary work, and meet the product of these schools with 
broader opportunities for the cosmopolitan character of their individual tendencies. 
(4) There is an alarming and increasing lack of efficient teachers, especially men, for 
secondary schools. This is particularly true of men prepared for the newer lines of 
work. Colleges are not yet equipped to prepare these teachers, and if they were the  
-P-A-G-E-280
  260 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
meager compensation of the teacher as against the larger expectation of commercial 
life offers small hope of relief. The only solution of this difficulty lies in the recog- 
nition of the high quality of the teacher’s service, and in lifting that service from 
the plane of semiphilanthropy to that of a real profession. 
The special committee appointed to investigate the marking system 
submitted a report. Among other things, a series of results was 
given— 
showing how four different markers in a State department of education differed in 
their evaluation of exactly the same papers. When the papers examined were in 
history and reading the marks differed on an average from 7 to more than 8 per cent. 
In some cases the difference between two markers’ judgments was as high as 20 per 
cent. This shows the ambiguity of percentage marks. 
In summarizing the report the committee declared that it had 
endeavored to show that— 
the thorough-going study of the marking system would be advantageous in clearing 
up the ambiguities which now exist in that system. It has aimed to show further that 
if this material could be collected in a proper way and in sufficient quantities, it could 
be used in comparing institutions with each other. 
Principal Jesse B. Davis, of the Central High School, Grand Rapids, 
Mich., read a paper on ‘Vocational guidance, a function of the public 
school.” He declared that— 
much of the failure and disappointment in life and possibly much of the crime that 
exists is due to the fact that so large a proportion of our youth go out from our public 
schools with but little special preparation for the work which they find themselves 
compelled to enter in order to live, and with no definite aim or ambition dominating 
their lives. On all sides do we find men who are the slaves of uncongenial labor, 
struggling to make out a meager living in an occupation for which they were never 
intended. The number of men and women who can truthfully be called successful 
in life form a very small proportion of the population of our country. Among those 
who in old age have counted themselves successful are many who did not find their 
life work until they were past middle life. 
Going out from our public schools to-day is a vast army of boys and girls, several 
million strong, who will never finish the free education that is offered them, but who 
will enter the field of unskilled labor. The desire to earn a few dollars in a position 
which has no possible future, leads them from their best opportunity to prepare for 
life’s battles. Our annual tribute to the Cretan Minotaur of ‘‘Blind alley employ- 
ments” is increasing from year to year. 
SOUTHERN ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGE WOMEN. 
The eighth annual convention of this association was held at Jack- 
sonville, Fla., April 20-21, 1911. The report of the committee on 
standards of colleges for women contained statistics from five States— 
Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Louisiana. 
Miss Elizabeth A. Colton, chairman of the committee, said: 
In these tabulations I have tried to present the admission requirements of these 
institutions in terms of the standard unit for measuring secondary school work, and 
also to make an approximate estimate of the amount of college work, if any, done 
in each. 
There are in the five States under consideration three of the four colleges for women 
which belong to the Association of Colleges and Preparatory Schools of the Southern
-P-A-G-E-281
  
UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES, 261 
States: Goucher College (Woman’s College of Baltimore), in Maryland; Randolph- 
Macon Woman’s College, in Virginia; and Sophie Newcomb, in Louisiana. There are 
in these States, also, 7 other colleges which, according to their catalogue announce- 
ments, are now requiring the standard 14 entrance units, but which are not eligible to 
membership in the above association on account of their failure to comply with one 
or two important regulations—chiefly the one demanding that preparatory and 
collegiate departments be kept rigidly distinct in faculty, in students, and in disci- 
pline. Three of these are in Maryland—Mount St. Agnes College, Notre Dame of Mary- 
land, and the Woman’s College of Frederick; 2 in Virginia—Hollins and Sweet 
Briar; 1 in North Carolina—Meredith College; and 1 in South Carolina—Converse. 
There are 3 others—Salem College and Greensboro Female College in North 
Carolina, and the College for Women in South Carolina—which require 12 units. But 
in addition to the 3 southern association colleges mentioned above and the 10 which 
seem to have more or less claim to recognition, there are in these 5 States 30 other 
ingtitutes, seminaries, and colleges for girls which confer the degree of bachelor of arts; 
in other words, we have 42 degree-conferring women’s colleges in just one-third of the 
Southern States—more than seven times as many as in the whole of New England. 
When we complete our investigation of colleges for women in the South, we are 
planning to publish our statistics with a view that such information may help colleges 
to state clearly in their catalogues just what they are capable of doing thoroughly. 
It is to be hoped that this data will not encourage any institution to attempt the 
impossible, but that it will discourage any from claiming to be what it isnot. And in 
order that all colleges may have a common standard of comparison, we have presented 
to the committee on resolutions the following recommendations: 
(1) That the Southern Association of College Women request all institutions belong- 
ing to the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching either to designate 
their admission requirements in standard units, or if they use some other terminology 
in all cases to give the equivalent in standard units. A number of colleges on the 
accepted list of the Carnegie Foundation state in their catalogues that they require 3 
“points” in mathematics; but fail to say that these 3 points are equivalent to only 
2.5 units. And since all their other ‘‘points’’ correspond exactly to the standard 
unit, several southern colleges interpret these 3 points in mathematics as 3 units. 
(2) That the Southern Association of College Women request all southern colleges 
for women that confer degrees to state their admission requirements in standard units. 
Since degree-conferring institutions for women in the South vary in standard from 
poor preparatory schools to colleges of recognized standard, it is desirable that some 
distinct basis of comparison be established. The majority of southern ‘‘colleges” do 
not state definitely either the amount of work required in a subject or the length of 
time a subject must be pursued before a candidate is admitted to the freshman class. 
(3) That the Southern Association of College Women request all organizations to 
use the term ‘‘unit” only when it is of standard value. The Virginia Association 
of Colleges and Schools for Girls designates a unit as ‘‘one year’s work with daily class 
meetings for a time not less than 30 minutes.” A Virginia unit is, therefore, equivalent 
only to 0.6 or 0.7 of a standard unit. 
(4) That the Southern Association of College Women request all State high-school 
inspectors in the South in their reports of the work done in the public high schools to 
give credit in units only to subjects recognized either by the Association of Colleges 
and Preparatory Schools of the Southern States or by the College Entrance Examina- 
tion Board. Some high-school inspectors count arithmetic as a high-school subject, 
and give it a credit of one unit in a high-school curriculum; and some give four units 
credit to preparatory work in English, which is counted as three units by the Associa- 
tion of Colleges of the Southern States.

ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN AGRICULTURAL COLLEGES AND EXPERI- 
MENT STATIONS. 
The twenty-fourth annual convention of the association was held - 
at Washington, D. C., November 16-18, 1910. 
The report of the committee on graduate study dealt chiefly with 
the graduate school of agriculture held at the Iowa State College 
July 4-29, 1910. The committee recommended that the fifth gradu- 
ate school be held in 1912. In the opinion of the committee— 
the graduate school by stimulating advanced study will make it necessary for the 
agricultural colleges to differentiate more clearly between undergraduate and post- 
graduate work, and to provide more adequately for the latter. 
Commissioner Elmer Ellsworth Brown, Dr. Kendric C. Babcock, 
and Mr. A. C. Monahan, of the United States Bureau of Education, 
discussed the character of the new work of the bureau in the domain 
of higher education, especially as related to the land-grant colleges. 
The cooperation of the association was requested in this undertaking. 
A resolution approving the projected work of the United States 
Bureau of Education was adopted by the convention. 
The committee on extension work submitted a report, which was 
devoted to a discussion of— 
the problems confronting extension work in agricultural colleges, notably those deal- 
ing with the need cf largely increased funds for the purpose and the source from which 
these should be derived, definitions and nomenclature relating to extension work, 
the types of work to be undertaken, the forms of administrative organization, the 
training requisite for workers, and the problem of social leadership. 
Regarding the method of organization, the committee favored in 
general— 
the plan whereby the work is performed by a director or superintendent of extension 
work, responsible directly to the head of the agricultural work of the institution, and 
a corps of workers made up in part of men giving practically all their time to extension 
teaching and in part of the regular college and station staff. 
The following officers were chosen for the ensuing year: President, 
W. H. Jordan, of New York; secretary treasurer, J. L. Hill, of 
Vermont. 
EXCHANGE OF INSTRUCTORS. 
In accordance with a tentative plan of exchanges, announcement 
is made that Dr. Albert Bushnell Hart, professor of the science of 
government, Harvard University, will divide one-half of the aca- 
demic year 1911-12 between Colorado College, Colorado Springs, 
Colo.; Grinnell College, Grinnell, lowa; Knox College, Galesburg, Ill.; 
and Beloit College, Beloit, Wis. 
In return each one of the four colleges above mentioned will send 
to Harvard for one-half year one of their young instructors to devote 
one-third of his time to teaching in some Harvard course. The 
remaining time he may devote to graduate and research work, as he
-P-A-G-E-283

sees fit. Prof. E. C. Hills has been designated by Colorado College 
as the first return instructor. He will give instruction in Spanish 
literature at Harvard. 
IV. PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION. 
  
ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN LAW SCHOOLS. 
The eleventh annual meeting of the Association of American Law 
Schools was held at Boston, Mass., August 28-29, 1911. Prof. 
William R. Vance, of Yale University, delivered the presidential 
address, taking as his theme, ‘‘The ultimate function of the teacher 
of law.” In the main the address was a discussion of the law 
teacher as an efficient agency in bringing about ‘‘the wise, compre- 
hensive, and prompt adaptation of our law and procedure to the new 
and changing needs of society.’’ Prof. Harlan F. Stone, dean of the 
Columbia University law school, read a paper on ‘The funetion of 
the American university law school.” He called attention to the 
fact that of ‘‘the 81 college or university law schools in the United 
- States, 25, or nearly one-third, maintain a two-year course, and of 
these 9 maintain evening schools only. In the case of a very large 
percentage of college or university law schools, it requires only a slight 
knowledge of their curricula to know that their university relation- 
ship is more nominal than real, so far as any influence is exerted on 
their scholarship.” Prof. Stone further asserted that ‘‘an even larger 
percentage serve no educational purpose beyond the preparation of 
their students for the bar examinations, which in many of their 
respective States are notoriously lax and insufficient.” He advocated 
fewer law schools and higher standards of legal education. Baron 
Uchida, Japanese ambassador to the United States, read a paper on 
“The teaching of jurisprudence in Japan.” 
AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION—SECTION OF LEGAL EDUCATION. 
The section of legal education of the American Bar Association 
met at Boston, August 30-31, 1911. Mr. John B. Sanborn, of Wis- 
consin, read a paper on “‘The advisability of a law school training as 
a prerequisite for admission to the bar.” Among other things, he 
said: 
The office is the place to learn practice. A trial in a justice court gives a much bet- 
ter training in the practice of law than does the best moot court ever organized. The 
student court can in no proper sense be compared to the medical clinic. I have 
become firmly convinced that the law school which tries to give instruction in the art 
as well as the science of practice, which leaves the fundamental principles which 
underlie all practice and attempts to follow the shifting codes and practice acts of 
various States, is wasting the time both of its faculty and its students. This should 
frankly be left to the office.  
-P-A-G-E-284
  264 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
Mr. Frederic R. Coudert, of New York City, delivered an address 
on ‘The crisis of the law and professional incompetency.” 
He deplored the fact that the admission of ‘‘a large number of 
unlearned, unlettered and utterly untrained young lawyers, with no 
esprit de corps and little regard for the traditions of the profession, 
has been having and will continue to have a deleterious effect upon 
the administration of justice.’ Mr. Andrew A. Bruce, of North 
Dakota, read a paper on ‘‘The true mission of State boards of bar 
examiners and their opportunity in legal education,” which was fol- 
lowed by an animated discussion. 
AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. 
The sixty-second annual session of the American Medical Associa- 
tion was held at Los Angeles, Cal., June 26-30, 1911. The report of 
the council on health and public instruction, including all the sub- 
committees of the council, was an important feature of the session. 
The organization work of the council has been in charge of Dr. J. N. 
McCormack. During the year Dr. McCormack has held meetings and 
delivered public addresses in 97 cities in 11 States. The report says: 
The public is eager to be enlightened on sanitary and public-health matters and is 
showing increased appreciation of the efforts of the association in this direction. The 
council is considering the advisability of putting a number of speakers in the field, 
as.the work to be done is far too great for the strength of one man. 
The following officers were elected for the ensuing year: Dr. Abra- 
ham Jacobi, New York City, president; Dr. Alexander R. Craig, 
Chicago, Ill., secretary. 
COUNCIL ON MEDICAL EDUCATION, 
Dr. Arthur D. Bevan, chairman, presented the report of the council 
on medical education and legislation. The seventh annual conference 
of the council was held in Chicago, Ill., March 1-3, 1911. Dr. Bevan 
recommended a simplification of the materia medica examinations. 
Speaking of the American standard of medical education, he said: 
Those of us who are familiar with the situation believe that modern medical edu- 
cation needs a training in a good secondary school; a premedical course in the sciences 
of physics, chemistry, and biology; a thorough four-year course in a medical school; 
and, lastly, a practical year as an interne in a hospital. I think we all agree on that 
as a minimum training necessary to prepare a student for independent practice. 
That would mean essentially a minimum of six years of training from a high school. 
While it is evident that such a requirement could not at once be put in force through 
out the whole country, nevertheless I state without any hesitation that anything 
short of that as the ultimate requirement appears to me to be insufficient. 
Dr. N. P. Colwell read an elaborate paper on ‘‘Progress and needs 
in medical education,” which was well illustrated with graphic sta- 
tistics. He said: ee

PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION. 265. 
Changes for the better in medical education have been particularly rapid since 1904, 
when the Council on Medical Education was organized. Up to that year the number 
of medical colleges, mostly of the proprietary variety, continued to increase, regardless 
of the frequently published references to the overcrowded condition of the profession 
and regardless of reports frequently presented showing the need of better rather than a 
larger number of medical colleges. Since 1904 there has been at first a gradual and 
then a positive decrease in the number of colleges, until now the number has been 
reduced to 129. Itissignificant to note that the positive decline has been since 1907, 
when the classification of medical colleges, based on the council’s first actual inspec- 
tion of all the medical colleges of the United States, was read at the third annual 
conference. Of the 44 colleges closed since 1907, 20 colleges were closed outright 
and 24 by merging with others. 
Dr. Colwell advocated the manifest advantages of the examinations 
held by the College Entrance Examination Board. 
Papers were also read by Dr. T. S. Fiske, Dr. E. P. Lyon, Dr. C; R. 
Bardeen, etc. 
ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN MEDICAL COLLEGES. 
The twenty-first annual meeting of the association was held at 
Chicago, February 27-28, 1911. Dr. John A. Witherspoon, president, 
delivered an address on ‘‘Cooperation in establishing standards of 
medical education,” in which he made the following suggestions: 
(1) This association should, adopt a uniform standard after consultation with all 
forces interested and enforce this standard by frequent inspections of members. 
(2) Inspections of both applicants and members should be placed in the hands of the 
judicial council or a committee appointed for that purpose; at least two men should 
be required for the inspection of any school, and the report should be in writing for 
future reference. (3) The interests of the association demand that the work be 
divided up so as to utilize as many men and their influence as possible, if we would 
broaden our field of usefulness in both higher educational and moral or ethical standing 
sufficiently to make membership an honor so distinctive that all good schools will 
desire the connection. (4) At present the four-year high school, or the 14 units for 
entrance and a four-year strictly graded course of study of 4,000 hours, is as high as 
the conditions of education will permit. (5) If an additional yearis wise, then a fifth 
year, following the present four-year plan, which shall be strictly practical and bed- 
side in hospital wards, is preferable, and this association should insist that a hospital 
controlled by the college is essential to thorough training. 
The secretary-treasurer reported that 46 colleges are now in mem- 
bership in the association. The committee on pedagogics, Dr. George 
H. Hoxie, chairman, submitted a report, in which appeared the fol- 
lowing statement regarding the ‘‘unit of credit:” 
We believe that the average student can not work profitably either in class or by 
himself more than 12 hours a day for 5 days in the week, or if we deprive him of the 
Saturday holiday, for 10 hours for 6 days in the week; that is, we regard 60 hours.a 
week as the optimum number of hours for medical students under average conditions. 
This, for 32 weeks of actual teaching, means 1,920 hours, or for a gross number of 36 
weeks; 2,160 hours. 
In order to-establish a ratio between class work and home acaael we have sent out 
a circular to all of the leading colleges of the country. To this we have received 40 
replies. Of these 40 institutions, 18 have not established a definite ratio, 14 call for
-P-A-G-E-286
  266 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
2 hours of preparation for a recitation or lecture, and 1 hour for a 2-hour labora- 
tory or clinic exercise, and 7 have only 1 hour for the first and about one-half hour 
for the second. In other words, of the 22 institutions that have established a ratio, 
the great majority look on 3 hours as the unit of time allowance for each class 
exercise. Should we interpret our association curriculum of 1,000 hours as equally 
divided between lecture or recitation and laboratory or clinic exercise, we must 
calculate that it calls for a total of 2,500 hours each year—a figure which in the light 
.of the reports made on our schools during the past two years seems rarely attained. 
For this reason your committee is of the opinion that the work of our schools would 
be more efficient if each faculty would establish the ratio we suggest and then hold the 
jnstructors and students up to a standard of work justifying the three-hour unit men- 
tioned above. 
Your committee believe, furthermore, that in the adoption of the new curriculum 
the value of the unit should be determined; and we respectfully recommend that the 
ratio be stated definitely as that of two hours of preparation or after-reading to each 
hour of recitation or lecture, and one hour of preparation or after-reading to each two 
hours of laboratory or clinic teaching. In other words, we believe that it would be of 
distinct advantage to credit work by units instead of hours—each unit representing a 
period of three hours; and that our school announcements should definitely state how 
these hours are to be subdivided in each course. Unless our school announcements 
contain such definitions, some of us will be credited with the intention to deceive even 
though guiltless of such an intention—for even now there is, as we have seen, great dis- 
parity; and the tendency is for this inequality to grow worse rather than better. 
Emphasis was laid on the fact that the simple imparting of informa- 
tion is not real teaching, but that the student must be led to acquire 
logical methods of thought and argument. It was pointed out that 
many medical instructors do not keep this purpose in mind, and even 
if they did, would not understand the principles of pedagogy sufli- 
ciently well to attain the desired result. The report suggested that 
“the regular faculty meetings be utilized for the discussion of these 
principles—best under the guidance of some professional teacher 
brought in for the occasion.” 
The report of the committee on medical education, Dr. William J. 
Means, chairman, was as follows: 
In accordance with a resolution passed at the last meeting of the association your 
committee, after a thorough and full consideration of the question of preliminary edu- 
cation, prepared and submitted amendments to the constitution which were presented 
to each college 30 days previous to this meeting, making more definite the present high- 
school standard. We earnestly recommend that these amendments be passed. 
THE FIVE YEARS’ MEDICAL COURSE. 
After considering the question of a five years’ course, the committee does not deem 
it wise to present a schedule for your consideration. The present unsettled condition 
of medical legislation in the States of the Union, coupled with the uncertainties thag 
exist among the colleges themselves, places the subject in that state of development 
and uncertainty that precludes the presentation of even a tentative schedule. The 
questions that confronted us were: (1) Shall the fifth year be a terminal one to the 
present four years’ course limited to clinical training, or shall a part of the time be 
given to the study of medical sciences in the beginning of the course? (2) In the 
States where legislative enactments have advanced the requirements beyond a high- 
school standard no provision has been made as to whether the course shall be giver 
   
-P-A-G-E-287
  
PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION. 267 
absolutely in a literary college or as a preliminary course in a medical college. The 
trend of legislation, however, has been toward the literary training rather than increas- 
ing the medical curriculum. The difficulties in the way are that but very few of the 
literary colleges are equipped to give a definite premedical course, and very few are 
willing to change their present curricula to accommodate the medical colleges. While, 
therefore, we do not deem it wise for the association to adopt any prescribed schedule 
for a five years’ course, we believe colleges which are members of the association 
should urge on their graduates the necessity for a hospital year before entering practice, 
and that proper inducements should be offered them to take the course. 
DENTAL FACULTIES ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES. 
The third annual meeting of the association was held at Iowa City, 
Towa, March 8, 1911. The committee on education recommended to 
the association that the minimum standard of four years’ high-school 
education now required for admission to the schools of the associa- 
tion— 
shall be as defined by the regents of the University of the State of New York, this to 
include one year of work in chemistry, the requirement in chemistry to take effect in 
1912-13. 
The attention of the committee has been called to the fact that the regents of the 
State of New York issue a special dental certificate on examination, but suggests that 
the scope of examination for the special certificate be further investigated before the 
schools of this association accept such certificates as covering the preliminary educa- 
tional requirements. 
‘Your committee has carefully considered the advisability of adopting a four-year 
curriculum, and as the result of its deliberations we deem it inexpedient at the present 
time to-adopt an obligatory four-year curriculum. We, however, recommend the 
adoption of an elective fourth-year course, the association to prescribe what subjects 
are to be pursued in the fourth year. 
With reference to standardizing the curricula of the schools of this association, we 
have been unable to formulate any definite plan to this end, but recommend that steps 
be taken to standardize the curricula of the schools, and we also recommend that this 
question be referred back to the educational committee, or a special committee 
appointed for the purpose, for further consideration. 
As to the number of conditions which a matriculate may be allowed to carry on 
entrance to the schools of this association, we recommend that this be left to the dis- 
cretion of the different schools. 
The recommendation of the committee regarding ‘‘the extension of 
the graduate phase of instruction in lieu of adopting a four-year cur- 
riculum at the present time’’ was, on motion, adopted by the associa- 
tion. 
The question of the investigation of educational institutions by the 
Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching was discussed, 
and a resolution adopted inviting the Carnegie Foundation to make 
an investigation of the educational conditions in the dental schools 
holding membership in the association, such as was made of the 
medical schools of the United States.

  “268 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
V. RELIGIOUS AND ETHICAL EDUCATION. 
RELIGIOUS EDUCATION ASSOCIATION. 
The eighth general convention of the Religious Education Associa- 
tion met in Providence, R. I., February 14-16, 1911. The general 
theme of discussion was “Religious education and the American 
home.” 
The following declaration of principles was adopted at the meeting: 
We declare it our aim not to rival or supplant any existing organizations, but to 
inspire all existing organizations and undertakings with the great ideal of character 
building as the goal of both education and religion. 
We aim at cooperative and persistent study, at the conference and stimulating of 
leaders, the guidance and service of the people. Such work is more vital to this 
country to-day than ever before in its history. The moral awakening which has come 
to our land in recent years, the swift growth of social consciousness, the new sense of 
responsibility for childhood, these developments emphasize the need of moral and 
religious, as well as intellectual culture. 
It is not enough to give young people the tools of civilization; we must give them 
the will to use those tools aright. We must develop not only eye and ear and hand; 
we must develop also affection and purpose and volition. 
We affirm that while recent economic and industrial changes have deeply affected 
and disturbed American home life, there is in this fact no reason to despair, but rather 
for serious endeavor to reinterpret old ideals in terms of the new situation. 
We affirm that the preservation of the purity and sanctity of the home is essential 
to the preservation of church and school and of civilization itself. We condemn all 
attacks upon the sacred institution of marriage, whether made consciously by restless 
and reckless writers, or unconsciously by those who use the home for merely selfish 
ends. 
In the enduring affection and mutual sacrifice of the true home we see the best 
antidote to exaggerated individualism and social anarchy. We ask the aid of all who 
love their country in the great task of making the home not the minister of pleasure 
but the school of character. 
We affirm the need of instruction in all churches and colleges as to the obligations 
of parenthood and the equal obligation of filial duty. To all clubs formed for purposes 
of general culture we recommend the study of children’s rights and duties. 
To all communities we suggest and urge persistent study of social and moral con- 
ditions in the homes of the people. The home must be set in its true place as the 
central agency in the making of men. All parents must be led to see themselves as 
primarily the educators of their children. 
The conservation of the national health, physical and moral, depends absolutely 
upon the purity, fidelity, and discipline of the home. To the great work of preserving 
the purity, Increasing the fidelity, and promoting the discipline of the American home 
we would devote ourselves for another year. 
MORAL EDUCATION. 
The conference on moral phases of public education, appointed 
early in 1910 by the council of the Religious Education Association, 
met in New York February 16-17, 1911. Its purpose as ‘stated “‘is

   not to further any preconceived propaganda, but to take account of 
existing conditions, and to consider whether any advance move- 
ments can now be agreed upon.” Among other resolutions the 
conference voted that— 
Direct moral instruction, varying in content according to conditions, systematic 
or otherwise according to personal preference be employed as a means of moral educa- 
tion, with the special object of developing the power and habit of moral thoughtfulness. 
That courses in personal and social ethics and moral instruction and training form 
a prominent part in the curriculum of institutions for the training of teachers. 
That we approve of the greatly increased emphasis in the teaching of the biological 
sciences laid upon personal and institutional hygiene and, in particular, upon sex- 
hygiene and eugenics. 
That it is the sense of this conference that the Council of Religious Education be 
requested to call another such conference as soon as may seem advisable, and that at 
such conference the relation of the content of the curriculum to the practical life of 
the pupil receive special consideration. 
Dr. Herman H. Horne, of New York University, was the chair- 
man of the conference. 
The council of the Religious Education Association met at Teachers 
College, Columbia University, New York City, February 16-17, 1910. 
Papers were read on “The moral phases of public education.” 
NATIONAL INSTITUTION FOR MORAL INSTRUCTION. 
The moral education board completed its organization by incor- 
porating on March 29, 1911, under the name of the National Institu- 
tion for Moral Instruction. 
The membership of the moral education board will be continued 
and enlarged as the advisory organization of this incorporated institu- 
tion. 
The national headquarters are at 507° North Charles Street, Balti- 
more, Md. The headquarters officials are: Dr. Milton Fairchild, 
director of instruction; Dr. Edward F. Buchner, chairman, executive 
committee, educational directors; and Mr. Charles H. Torsch, 
treasurer, chairman, finance directors. 
The institution work is to be endowed when the funds can be 
accumulated to the extent of $500,000, and a faculty of seven experts 
is to be set to. work preparing material for moral instruction. The 
distribution of material to schools will be at the expense of the schools, 
a small rental for lessons being charged. 
Distribution centers have been established at Baltimore, Md., at 
the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, Tenn.; at the Principals’ 
Protection Club, Chicago, Ill.; and at the University of California, 
Berkeley, Cal. 
The plan for visual instruction in morals is as follows: Photographs 
f things that actually happen in real life are taken especially for 
oral instruction; lantern slides from these, 70 to 100 for each lesson,

are projected on a screen and thus enlarged to life size before audiences 
of pupils in the school assembly halls; carefully prepared instruction 
as to what is right and fine in conduct is given as an explanation of the 
photographs while the pupils are studying them upon the screen; 
personal discussion, based on the illustrated lessons, between teachers 
and pupils in classrooms, gives application and-fixes the ideals per- 
manently in mind. 
The most important experiment of the year was made in the Chi- 
cago grammar schools. The stereopticon lesson “What I am going 
to do when I am grown up,” was offered for use during April and May 
to the Chicago Principals’ Protection Club. It was put through the 
entire system of grammar schools, the report being favorable. The 
aggregate audience for visual instruction in morals in various cities 
and towns of the United States for the past year was about 100,000 
boys and girls. 
If the endowment can be raised, an annual meeting of directors, 
with invited guests, will be held, at which papers on moral instruction 
will be presented and discussed. It is thought that an advance in the 
psychology of the moral life and in pedagogy of moral instruction and 
training is necessary before the schools can formulate an effective 
moral discipline. 
YOUNG MEN’S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION. 
The educational department of the Young Men’s Christian Associa- 
tion, organized in 1894 by the international committee for the en- 
couragement, promotion, and supervision of educational work among 
the different associations, reports gratifying progress during the year 
1910-11. The annual report of the above-mentioned department, 
published in Educational Notes, September, 1911, says: 
The number of students increased during the 12 months from 52,247 to 61,850, or 
9,603. men and boys, an increase of over 18 per cent, the largest in the history of the 
work. Tuition fees paid by these students advanced to $528,206 with an increase 
during the year of almost 22 per cent; total expenses multiplied by $100,000 and now 
amount to $773,303, an advance of about 17 per cent over the preceding year. The 
number of lectures and talks increased 1,704, or 26 per cent, with practically one-half 
million boys and men in attendance. The number of paid teachers has also grown 
to 2,549; and 22,169 men and boys are enrolled as club members, an increase of 25 
percent. That associations are committed, increasingly, to a better quality of work 
is indicated by an added interest and participation in the international examinations. 
During the year 4,536 examination papers were ordered by 137 associations, an increase 
of 26 per cent. 
Much attention has been given to special forms of industrial train- 
ing, also to vocational guidance. The work of teaching English to 
“New Americans” has advanced during the year, about 10,000 non- 
English-speaking men and boys having been enrolled as students.

Vi. SPECIAL EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES, 
NATIONAL CHILD LABOR CONFERENCE. 
The seventh annual conference on child labor was held at Birming- 
ham, Ala., March 9-12, 1911, under the auspices of the National Child 
Labor Committee. Judge N. B. Feagin, a member of the National 
Child Labor Committee, welcomed the conference, on behalf of the 
mayor of Birmingham. He said: 
We deem your coming auspicious in that you will teach us not to sacrifice the child 
life of this community in a mad eagerness to coin wealth; that life—a well-ordered 
life—is more valuable than material wealth; that the child is father to the man; 
that an educated, well-trained child gives us an honorable manhood and a splendid 
womanhood—a nation’s most valuable asset, its greatest honor and glory. 
Dr. Samuel McCune Lindsay, vice chairman of the national com- 
mittee, responded. He pointed out the fact that the first definitely 
constituted State child labor committee in this country was organized 
in Alabama. ‘The agitation in Alabama spread to other Southern 
States. Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas, and 
Arkansas, in addition to Alabama, passed their first child labor laws 
in 1903. Mr. Lindsay said: 
Then came the fear on the part of the representatives of industry that the coming 
prosperity of the South would be checked by legislative interference. You found also 
that strong opposition to your efforts to secure effective legislation came from non- 
resident capitalists, so that you and Mr. Murphy and his coworkers in those first legis- 
lative struggles in the South soon realized that a national movement must be organ- 
ized before each State could really secure the enactment of effective remedies. 
This is the reason why the National Child Labor Committee was formed in New 
York, in 1904, and it was in answer to this appeal from the South that a most remark- 
able group of distinguished American citizens, representing all sections of the country, 
both political parties, the church—Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish—institutions of 
learning, captains of industry, the labor unions, and social workers united as such 
diverse elements never had united before in the support of any single cause in the 
United States. - With this history fresh in mind, it is difficult to reconcile some recent 
misrepresentations of the work of the national committee by its natural enemies, the 
exploiters of childhood, who have tried to make it appear that it stood for a sectional 
attack upon southern industry, when in reality it stands as a nation-wide response toa 
sectional call for help which came in the first instance from the South but has been 
heard in every State in the Union. 
Dr. Felix Adler, chairman of the national committee, delivered 
an address on ‘Child labor a menace to civilization.” Hon. A. T. 
Stovall spoke on “Standards proposed by the United States com- 
mission on uniform laws.” He said: 
The uniform law will prevent shiftless, impecunious, and drifting parents from 
exploiting their children’s labor; and the manufacturer from removing, or threaten- 
ing to remove, to another State because of more favorable laws; and it will be easier 
of enforcement, because decisions of disputed questions in one State will be per- 
suasive, if not a precedent, in another State. 
 
-P-A-G-E-292
    272 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
The subject of uniform State legislation was first exploited by the 
American Bar Association some 30 years ago. The special com- 
mittee of the association on ‘‘A uniform child-labor law,” of which 
Mr. Stovall is a member, was appointed at the annual conference at 
Detroit, in August, 1909. Mr. Stovall said: 
I desire to thank the National Child Labor Committee for the great assistance ren- 
dered in the preparation of the law we reported to the conference of commissioners 
on uniform State laws at its last annual meeting in Chattanooga, in August, 1910, 
which law will come before the conference for discussion and adoption at its next 
annual meeting in Boston in August, 1911. 
Mr. Owen R. Lovejoy, general secretary of the National Child 
Labor Committee, presented a statement on behalf of the committee 
of seven years’ work for the improvement of child labor conditions in 
America. The outline “Of achievements of the American people 
developing legislation to protect the working child’ may be seen by 
the following schedules: 
1. During seven years five States passed their first law upon this subject: Delaware, 
Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and the District of Columbia. 
2. The eight-hour day has been established in Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Nebraska, 
New York, Wisconsin, Colorado, Oklahoma, North Dakota, Kansas, and the District 
of Columbia. 
3. Night work under 16 years has been made illegal in Alabama, California, Dela- 
ware, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, 
Nebraska, New Jersey, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Carolina, 
Vermont, Washington, and the District of Columbia. 
4, A 14-year-age limit as the minimum for employment in industry has been estab- 
lished in the following States: California, Colorado, Delaware, Idaho, Iowa, Ken- 
tucky, Louisiana, Maine, Missouri, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, North Dakota, New 
Jersey, Tennessee, West Virginia, Rhode Island, Kansas, and the District of Columbia. 
5. Departments of factory inspection have been established in Alabama, Colorado, 
Delaware, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, 
Texas, Tennessee, Virginia, and the District of Columbia. 
6. Methods of proving the age of children seeking employment have been-provided 
in the following States: California, lowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Mary- 
land, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, 
Rhode Island, Washington, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia. 
Meantime, compulsory education laws have been enacted or improved in a large 
number of States. 
SERIOUS DEFECTS. 
It might appear from this record that as much has been accomplished, the public 
could reasonably rest. We are apt to forget how large a country we have. There are 
still seven of our States which have not yet reached the 14-year-age limit, even for 
employment in factories. These States are: North Carolina, Maryland, Alabama, 
Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, and South Carolina. 
Alabama, Florida, Maryland, North Carolina, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, South 
Carolina, and Virginia permit the employment of boys of 12 years in mines. 
Children under 16 are still permitted to work at night in Arizona, Colorado, Con- 
necticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, South 
Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, West Virginia, and Wyoming. 
There are 35 States in the Union in which children under 16 years of ago may work 
more than 8 hours a day. Recently there has been widespread complaint against
-P-A-G-E-293
  SPECIAL EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES. 273 
confinement of children’in.poorly ventilated schoolrooms, where they spend the day 
in physical inactivity. Rapid improvement is coming in our schools through open- 
air classrooms and the development of manual arts; so that the evil complained of is 
decreasing; but if confinement in a schoolroom is injurious, what shall be said of the 
factory, where frequently the labor of the child also compels physical inaction at the 
almost automatic machine? Under the most objectionable conditions, the child is 
confined in school 1,000 hours annually. In Massachusetts the factory child is con- 
fined 2,912 hours a year, and in New York, where the 8-hour day prevails, he is sub- 
jected to 2,496 hours’ confinement. In Alabama a child of 12 years may legally work 
3,120 hours a year, or more than three times as many hours as he can be confined in 
school in States having the 9 or 10 months’ school year; while children of 14 years may 
be employed 78 hours a week or 4,056 hours a year. The total number of hours of 
daylight in the year, exclusive of Sundays, is 3,744; so that the manufacturing indus- 
tries of this State may legally employ their 14-year-old children 312 hours of the night 
besides all the hours of daylight. 
~ In 23 of our States there is up to the present time no method of determining how 
oid the children are who seek work in our industries. Our agents have frequently 
found 8, 9, and 10 year old boys applying for work in glass factories or coal mines, upon 
affidavits certifying them to be 14 or 16 years of age. In all these efforts at reform we 
must keep in mind the honor and dignity of our social institutions, and nothing is 
more fatal to the integrity of the American people than contempt for its own laws. 
When, by the very nature of the problem we lay upon the ignorant, impoverished, 
or greedy parent the temptation to deceive in order to secure employment for a child, 
we are guilty of placing the burden on the weak, where it does not belong, and pro- 
moting perjury by process of law. 
The States in which we do not require any aroae of the child’s age, or at least any 
proof worthy the name, are Colorado, Florida, Louisiana, Nevada, South Dakota, 
Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Wyoming, Alabama, Arkansas, Delivaces Georgia, 
Idaho, Indiana, Missouri, Mississippi, New Hampshire, North Carolina, South Caro- 
lina, and Tennessee. 
It is necessary that the laws to which we have referred shall be in charge of public 
officials clothed with adequate authority to enforce them. At present Arkansas, 
Florida, Georgia, Nevada, North Carolina, Utah, and Wyoming have no department 
intrusted with this duty, while the factory inspector in Missouri has jurisdiction only 
in the large cities, and the factory inspector in Louisiana only in the parish of Orleans; 
the factory inspector in Alabama is also required to visit and report on jails and alms- 
houses; and the governor of South Carolina has within two weeks vetoed the appro- 
priation made by the legislature for the two factory inspectors who, during the past 
two years, have assisted the commissioner of labor in laying the foundation of this 
branch of public service. 
It will be recognized from the foregoing tables that the problem of bringing the 
States of this Union up to a reasonable standard of child protection is complicated 
and difficult. It will be seen also that the lower standards as to age, hours of labor, 
and methods of enforcing the law are, with few exceptions, much inferior in the South 
to the standards attained in Northern and Western States. And while we of the 
North, with shame, confess that the extent of child labor in our great industrial com- 
munities overshadows child labor of the South, the phenomenal industrial develop- 
ment in many of your southern sections indicates that the time is near at hand when 
the South will rival the older industrial communities in the extent of manufacturing 
and commercial operations, and that unless the South speedily improves the laws now 
upon her statute books the curse of child labor will rest more heavily upon her com- 
munities than upon others.

    274 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911, 
The reports of the general secretary and the southern«secretary 
showed progress all along the line. Stress was laid on the fact that 
States and communities of the United States are woefully lacking in 
measures for collecting information concerning child welfare, as a 
basis for the extension and improvement of legislation for children. 
England and Germany are far ahead of us in this regard. 
Among the speakers at the conference was ex-President Roosevelt, 
who dwelt forcibly on the right of the State to interfere on behalf of 
the child, and advocated the abolition of night work for children. He 
favored the establishment of a Federal children’s bureau by the 
National Government for the collection and dissemination of data 
regarding the welfare of children. 
A resolution was adopted indorsing the bill pending in the Legis- 
lature of Alabama making an amendment to the present child-labor 
law as recommended by the governor. 
CHILD-WELFARE EXHIBIT OF NEW YORK. 
The Child-Welfare Exhibit, the first of its kind, was held in the 
Seventy-first Regiment Armory, New York City, January 18 to Feb- 
ruary 12,1911. More than 300 of the leading social workers, investi- 
gators, and persons interested in the well-being of children volunteered 
their time to make the exhibit a success. The cost of the affair 
amounted to $70,000. The chairman of the general committee was 
Mr. John Sherman Hoyt. 
The department of schools was in charge of an expert committee, 
which had been preparing for the exhibit for a year or more. 
The aim of the school exhibit was— 
to show the various aspects of the child’s school life—not only the instruction and 
training he receives during the regular sessions of school, but also the educational 
influences which are brought to bear upon his life, directly and indirectly, through 
the instrumentality of the school, after school hours, in the evening, and during the 
long summer vacation. 
The exhibit was explained by a force of more than 1,000 volunteer 
“explainers,” serving in 2,400 shifts of four hours each, and covering 
each section of the exhibit every hour of the 24 days during which it 
was open. 
There were 13 sections representing associations and clubs; churches, 
temples, and Sunday schools; health, homes, laws, and administra- 
tion; libraries and museums; public and private philanthropy; streets, 
recreations, and amusements; schools; settlements; work and wages. 
The New York City public-school system occupied the largest space 
in the section devoted to education. Two large screens at the entrance 
tabulated the decade of school growth from 1900 to 1910. Charts, 
phetographs, and moving pictures were used to illustrate the school
-P-A-G-E-295

* curriculum. Music and physical and manual training were exempli- 
fied by classes, as were games, folk dances, the fire recess, ete. 
The department of homes, which had a well-arranged display of 
model housefurnishing, clothing, food, etc., emphasized the fact that 
the next generation would be better prepared to cope with the domestic 
problems if all schools, elementary, especially, taught the proper divi- 
sion and control of family expenditures; and, as a part of the sewing 
course, presented a practical knowledge of materials and instructed 
each girl how to care for her own clothing in order to obtain the best 
service from it. 
Among the measures advocated by the section on work and wages 
was the appointing of an officer by the board of education, who should 
have supervisory control of all minors engaged in street trades. The 
effect of home work in the tenements upon school attendance was 
emphasized. It was shown that many of the child workers of the 
tenements lose a third of school time and are often physically unfitted 
to study. 
The need of more vocational schools was strongly urged. 
The educational work of the 88 libraries and the 7 science and art 
museums was demonstrated by classes. A miniature children’s 
library was exhibited, with all its features, such as story telling, cir- 
culation of books from the classroom libraries, as well as circulation 
from the children’s rooms. The latter reached the total of 4,165,887 
in 1909. 
The first five days of the regular afternoon and evening conferences 
of the exposition were occupied with the subject of education. Supt. 
William H. Maxwell presided over the initial conference on the public 
school and the child. 
At the opening conference District Supt. Edward W. Stitt advocated 
the wider use of the school plant. Special stress was laid upon this 
question in the exhibit. 
CHILD-WELFARE EXHIBIT OF CHICAGO. 
- The remarkable success attending the Child-Welfare Exhibit, of 
New York City induced the social workers and educators of Chicago 
to give a similar exhibition in the Coliseum of Chicago, May 11-25, 
1911. The managers of the New York affair generously loaned their 
exhibit to Chicago without charge aside from the transportation 
expenses. But the people of Chicago did not rest content with a 
display of child welfare in New York City, but supplemented it with 
special features showing the life of the child in Chicago. Mrs. Cyrus 
Hall McCormick, jr., donated a large sum of money to finance the 
exposition. Experts in every line were secured. Mrs. Ella Flagg 
Young, superintendent of the Chicago public schools, was chairman 
of the committee on schools. The exhibition of graphic statistics 
 
-P-A-G-E-296
  
  276 “- EDUCATION: REPORT, 1911, 
relating to child labor in Chicago attracted attention. On one wall 
were displayed a number of the certificates-which: are issued in 
Chicago to children over 14 years old. There were 2,918 of these 
issued in 1910 to child workers. ‘‘The age limit is too low,’ explained 
one of the placards. ‘‘Many of these children could barely read and 
write.” 
THE GATZERT FOUNDATION. 
The University of Washington in March, 1911, received a donation 
of $30,000, the income from which is to be devoted to work for defec- 
tive children. The money was given in memory of Bailey and 
Babette Gatzert, who were long residents of Seattle. Mr. Sigmund 
‘Schwabacher, of San Francisco, and the late Mr. Abraham Schwab- 
acher, brothers of the late Mrs. Gatzert, contributed equally to the 
fund. The deed of gift provides that the income of the fund— 
shall be used to maintain a bureau of child-welfare—the work of said bureau to con- 
sist in the promotion in various ways of education forthe better care and treatment of 
children suffering from defects, either physical or mental, especially such defective 
children as can in spite of their defects attend school of some sort and benefit by some 
form of school education and training. 
PLAYGROUND ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA. 
The fifth annual convention of the Playground Association of 
America was held at Washington, D. C., May 10-13, 1911. The 
report of the secretary indicated that playgrounds generally from 
one end of the country to the other had attracted more attention and 
received more financial support than during any previous year of the 
association’s existence. Thirty-two cities now employing 643 workers 
are actively engaged in playground work. In the 12 months pre- 
ceding the convention about $3,000,000 was spent in 184 cities for the 
improvement and establishment of playgrounds. Chicago and Cin- 
cinnati have each voted bond issues of a million dollars for recreation. 
Pittsburgh has voted $800,000 for the extension of its playground 
system and $200,000 for its maintenance. 
By a unanimous vote of the convention the name of the Playground 
Association of America was changed to the Playground and Recrea- 
tion Association of America. The reason given for this change of 
cognomen was that the association had outgrown ‘‘its former limited 
sphere of merely controlling playgrounds and now has halls of recrea- 
tion for both children and grown-ups.” 
THE WILL OF MR. JOSEPH PULITZER. 
Mr. Joseph Pulitzer, the proprietor of the New York World and the 
St. Louis Post-Dispatch, who died on October 29, 1911, made some 
notable gifts to education in his will, which was filed for probate on 
November 14, 1911. The most conspicuous features of the document
-P-A-G-E-297
  
SPECIAL EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES. 277 
are the ratification.of a gift of $1,000,000 to Columbia University for 
the founding of a school of journalism, and an additional sum of 
$1,000,000-for- the-school of journalism and for prizes which it is 
instructed to award. The second gift is to be paid to the university 
if within-seven years of the testator’s death the school shall, in the 
opinion of his executors, have been in successful operation for three 
years. In the meanwhile the income is to be paid to Barnard College, 
for scholarships. In the event that Columbia University fails to com- 
ply with the conditions, the bequest will go to Harvard University. 
A bequest.was also made to the trustees of Columbia University 
of $250,000 to establish a fund to be known as ‘‘The Pulitzer schol- 
arship fund,” the income therefrom to be distributed by the trustees— 
among young men wholly or partly educated in the public schools of the city of New 
York, and who have passed their examinations in such schools with special credit, 
and who wish to receive a college education, but need pecuniary assistance for that 
purpose to give them means of support while fitting for and going through college. 
Other bequests were made, among them being $500,000 to the 
Metropolitan Museum of Art and a like sum to the Philharmonic 
Society of New York City. 
PHELPS-STOKES FUND. 
The Phelps-Stokes Fund was incorporated on May 10, 1911, by 
the Legislature of New York. In addition to maintaining funds for 
erecting and improving tenement-house dwellings in the city of New 
York for the poor families of that metropolis, the corporation is 
further organized for the purpose of educating— 
negroes, both in Africa and the United States, North American Indians, and needy 
and deserving white students, through industrial schools, the founding of scholarships, 
and the erection or endowment of school buildings or chapels. It shall be within the 
purpose of said corporation to use any means to such ends which shall from time to 
time seem expedient to its members or trustees, including research, publication, the 
establishment and maintenance of charitable or benevolent activities, agencies, and 
institutions, already established. 
CARNEGIE CORPORATION OF NEW YORK. 
On June 9, 1911, the Carnegie Corporation of New York was 
incorporated by the Legislature of the State of New York, for— 
the purpose of receiving and maintaining a fund or funds and applying the income 
thereof to promote the advancement and diffusion of knowledge and understanding 
among the people of the United States, by aiding technical schools, institutions 
of higher learning, libraries, scientific research, hero funds, useful publications, and 
by such other agencies and means as shall from time to time be found appropriate 
therefor. 
The incorporators were as follows: Messrs. Andrew Carnegie, 
Elibu Root, William N. Frew, Henry S. Pritchett, Robert S. Wood- 
   
-P-A-G-E-298

ward, Charles L. Taylor, James Bertram, and Robert A. Franks. 
The following officers were subsequently elected: Mr. Carnegie, 
president; Senator Root, vice president; Mr. Franks, treasurer; and 
Mr. Bertram, secretary. 
The Carnegie Corporation has no connection with the previously 
organized bodies bearing the name of the ironmaster and philan- 
thropist except so far as its trustees feel that the objects of the 
corporation will be promoted by aiding one or another of these insti- 
tutions. The work of founding and aiding libraries, which has been 
carried on by Mr. Carnegie as an individual, will eventually be 
turned over to the corporation. 
On November 10, 1911, Mr. Carnegie endowed the corporation 
with the sum of $25,000,000. This gift was in the form of 5 per 
cent first-mortgage bonds of the United States Steel Corporation, 
the bonds being given as at par. The income, of which the incor- 
porators will have the disposal, is estimated at $1,250,000 a year. 
STATE EDUCATION BUILDING, NEW YORK. ° 
The Legislature of New York on June 2, 1911, passed an act author- 
izing the board of trustees of public buildings to contract for furniture, 
equipment, and decoration for the State education building for an 
amount not to exceed the aggregate sum of $75,000, in addition to 
the sum of $625,000 authorized by chapter 513 of the laws of 1910. 
On June 16, 1911, the sum of $250,000, in addition to the $500,000: 
authorized by chapter 13 of the laws of 1910, was appropriated for 
the construction and equipment of a power house, coal pockets, and 
conduits for furnishing heat, light, and power to the State capitol 
and education building at Albany. The legislature on July 29, 1911, 
passed an act authorizing the expenditure of $600,000 for continuing 
the construction of the State education building, also the sum of 
$200,000 for furniture, equipment, and decorating. On October 24, 
1911, the sum of $200,000 was appropriated for furniture and office 
fixtures. It is expected that the edifice will be ready for occupancy 
in whole or in part some time during the year 1912. 
STATE LIBRARY, NEW YORK. 
An act providing for the reestablishment and enlargement of the 
State library was passed by the legislature on October 24, 1911. 
The sum of $1,250,000 was appropriated for this purpose, which 
includes the gathering of suitable books, pamphlets, manuscripts, 
and other materials for the reference, historical, education, law, 
medical, and technological libraries, and the sociological, genealogical, 
and other collections therefor.

SPECIAL EDUCATIONAL AOTIVITIES. 279 
THE WENTWORTH INSTITUTE. 
The Wentworth Institute, of Boston, a new trade school estab- 
lished through the munificence of the late Arioch Wentworth, who 
left three and one-half millions of dollars for the purpose of indus- 
trial education, opened its doors to students on September 25, 1911. 
The buildings already erected include the foundry of the institute, 
main shop building, and a power house. Plans have been made for 
the expansion of the school in the future. For day students the fees 
are $6 per term and for evening students $6 per season of two terms, 
which sums do not pay even any considerable part of the expenses 
of instruction. The directors of the school considered that, if no 
fees at all were charged, some might apply who had little or no real 
interest in the work. 
The courses of education that are to be offered are of two types: 
First, short practical courses, one year in length, for the young man 
who wishes to train himself to become a skilled workman of the 
highest grade. There will be six of these courses—three in manu- 
facturing trades for machinists, patternmakers, and foundrymen, 
and three in the building trades for carpenters, plumbers, and elec- 
tric wiremen. Second, two-year courses; intended for young men 
who have previously had a considerable amount of practical experi- 
ence, but who are ambitious to become master mechanics, foremen, 
or superintendents. There will also be evening classes, in each one 
of the two shops and laboratories, for the benefit of students who are 
already employed during the day and can not afford the time to 
attend a day class. 
SOCIAL ORGANIZATION OF THE UNIVERSITY HIGH SCHOOL. 
_ By Franxuin W. Jounson, Principal. 
The University High School of the School of Education of the 
University of Chicago aims to cultivate the social nature of the pupils 
and has since its organization carried on a series of studies and experi- 
ments with the view of developing the principles and working out the 
means of social education through the medium of school life. The 
method of approach to the problem has been through the organiza- 
tion of the school life and by the incorporation of a new point of 
view into the old activities rather than by the introduction of new 
subjects into the curriculum. The general character of the experi- 
ments is indicated by the following accounts of the social activities, 
all of which are under the immediate supervision of the faculty 
committees. 
Assembly.—The program of the weekly assembly is introduced by 
a brief service of song and responsive reading. The remainder of the 
hour is used in a manner to serve the interests of the school. Matters 
_ of immediate public concern are presented by pupils who have them 
incharge. In this way athletic games, debating contests, the student
-P-A-G-E-300
  280 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911, 
publication, dramatics, etc., are discussed. School activities not so 
easily under observation of all are made the subject of special pro- 
grams. The method of issuing the school daily, embodying a descrip- 
tion of the whole process of bringing out a single issue is an instance 
of a program of this sort. Frequent musical programs are furnished 
by members of the faculty-and pupils. Finally the discussion of 
vital topics by the officers of the school and occasional set lectures and 
addresses make up the varied program which has for its aim the 
development of public standards, and a public spirit which may at 
once express and stimulate the best in the life of the school. 
Athletics.—The athletics of the school are under the direct charge of 
the department: of physical education. The policy governing all 
interscholastic contests, the approval of schedules for each contest, 
the recommendation of rules of eligibility, and the decision as to 
eligibility of individual students are in the hands of the faculty com- 
mittee on athletics and games. In general, it is the policy of the 
school to encourage all pupils to take a reasonable interest in athletics 
rather than to center attention on the production of a few successful 
teams. A suitable playground makes it possible to encourage inter- 
class contests and games. All teams are given adequate instruction, 
interclass schedules are planned for all the school sports, and suitable 
recognition is given the winning class teams. Emblems for pro- 
ficiency in athletics are publicly conferred once each quarter in the 
school assembly, with appropriate exercises designed to bring out 
the social and moral aspects of athletic life, and in particular to 
enphasize the fact that the individual has earned this recognition 
under strict rules guaranteeing the quality of his work. 
Parties —Every Friday during the autumn and winter at the close 
of the afternoon session an informal dance, open to all members of 
the school, is conducted under school supervision. These weekly 
parties have been given for seven years and have proved to be most 
helpful in the school life. Since all pupils of the school receive during 
the regular gymnastic classes the necessary instruction in dancing, 
they eome to the parties able to participate on even terms. It is 
the custom for the boys and girls to come individually. No cards or 
programs are permitted. In form, the dance is a modified cotillion. 
Pupils must be prompt in coming and must remain throughout the 
hour. It has come to be the accepted rule of the afternoon that no 
pupil may refuse to dance with another.. Public courtesy and school 
comradship characterizes these very simple but important ‘social 
gatherings. 
The Boys’ Club.—The University High School Club, a social club 
for boys, occupies a two-story building on the school grounds. It is 
open to all boys and to the men of the faculty each school day from 
12.30 to 6 p. m. on payment of a fee of $2 per semester. The officers
-P-A-G-E-301
  
SPECIAL EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES. 281 
of the club are boys of the school who are under the supervision of 
a member of the faculty. The club provides opportunity for agree- 
able social intercourse among the boys for the entertainment of 
visiting athletic teams. Occasional social events take place in the 
clubhouse on Friday and Saturday evenings. 
The Girls’ Club.—The social and recreation rooms for the girls 
occupy several rooms in a school building. The girls of the school 
are organized into a society known as the Girl’s Club, which has 
charge of these rooms. The object of the Girls’ Club is to promote 
helpful good comradeship among the girls and to give them an oppor- 
tunity to practice hospitality. In the housekeeping of the club, the 
girls are in close touch with the-home economics department. The 
club was furnished by groups of girls working under the supervision 
of this department. Parents and teachers have cooperated to make 
the club a success, two members of the Parents’ Association serving 
on the executive board and each committee having a faculty adviser. 
The very attractive clubrooms have proved a pleasant meeting place 
for the girls. They are open each school day from 12.30 to 4.30 p.m: 
There is no charge for membership. Each girl in the school is con- 
sidered a member of the Girls’ Club and is entitled to all its privileges. 
Other clubs.—The Clay Club, open to boys and girls, holds weekly 
meetings with programs consisting of debating, declamation, extem- 
poraneous speaking, music, and other social and literary features. 
The Engineering Club holds regular meetings throughout the year, 
at which reports are made and papers read, both by members of the 
club and by others. Frequent visits are made to the numerous 
manufacturing plants in the city. The Camera and Sketch Clubs 
interest many and make creditable exhibits of their work at the end 
of the year which attract the attention not only of members of the 
school but of many others. The Dramatic Club supplements regular 
work given to an elective class in connection with the English depart- 
ment. Perhaps the most creditable public performance connected 
with the social work of the school has been the annual dramatic 
entertainment which attracts a large and appreciative audience. 
Various musical clubs, both vocal and instrumental, meet regularly 
and furnish music for the school assemblies and for other public 
occasions. Modern language clubs make agreeable and profitable 
adjuncts to the classroom work in German and French. 
Student publications.—There are three student publications. The 
University High School Daily is a four-page newspaper, which covers 
in a thorough manner the daily happenings of the school, and also 
erves as a bulletin for announcements to pupils and faculty. A 
eparate group of editors has charge of each day’s issue during the 
eek, thus distributing the work so that it is not excessive. The 
Midway is a monthly devoted to literary work. The stories, poems,

and other material used are selected from the regular theme work 
of the English classes. The Correlator is an annual containing 250 
pages of high literary and artistic merit. 
The Students’ Council_—The Students’ Council is a representative 
body, consisting of the presidents and members elected by each class. 
Regular meetings are held at which matters of general interest to 
the school are discussed. Recommendations from the students to the 
faculty are made through the medium of the council. Measures 
under consideration by the faculty are sometimes referred to the coun- 
cil, and their opinion is sought. 
IIonor societies —A group of honor societies presents a unique 
feature of the school. One of these, the Senior Honor Society, is 
based on scholarship, and is open to boys and girls of the senior class 
who have been members of the school at least two years and have 
attained a certain high record of scholarship. Two other societies, 
one for the boys and the other for the girls, are composed of seniors 
who have performed distinguished service in promoting the social, 
as contrasted with the scholastic, life of the school. Membership in 
these honor societies is not secured until the election is approved by 
the faculty. 
Fraternities.—It is felt that such a varied and complete social life 
as the school provides for its members should remove all desire for 
the organization of secret societies among the pupils. However, con- 
sidering the fraternity situation in this and other communities, it is 
regarded necessary to make a formal prohibition of such organizations 
and to require of all applicants for admission to the school a state- 
ment, signed by the applicant and also by a parent or guardian, that 
the pupil is not and will not become a member of any secret organ- 
ization whatever. The responsibility for the keeping of this pledge 
rests upon the pupil and his parents or guardian. The school takes 
every possible step to remove opportunity or temptation to violate 
the pledge, and promptly removes anyone who is known to have 
violated it. 
The Parents’ Association.—The intelligent and substantial coop- 
eration of the Parents’ Association makes possible the extensive 
social organization of the school. The association has taken up for 
its consideration many of the features of the social organization 
described, and each year furnishes the money necessary to maintain) 
these activities. Through committees and individuals they come| 
into very close contact with the social life of the school. Meetings 
of the association are held twice each month during the school year. 
The university settlement.—The social life of the school finds oxpres: 
sion on the altruistic side in various activities connected with th 
university settlement. An effort is made to have these activities 
grow naturally from the normal social life of the school. During th

last two years, the classes in dramatic art have given two plays on 
the settlement stage which they had already given at the school; 
the girls’ gymnastic teams have given a series of drills and games in 
the settlement gymnasium; at Christmas, the students have provided 
useful gifts for the old people of the settlement; the school has also 
provided for summer outings for boys and girls of the settlement by 
money raised from musical and other entertainments. 
      
          
                    
     
            
    
        NATIONAL MUNICIPAL LEAGUE. 
The sixteenth annual meeting of the National Municipal League’ 
was held in Buffalo, N. Y., November 14-17, 1910. The committee 
on school extension, of which Prof. Edward J. Ward is chairman, made 
a report in which the term ‘‘social center” was defined as— 
the public building or group of buildings and grounds which form the capital of the’ 
neighborhood, the focal point of its common educational, recreational, political, and 
social life, the institution which is to the neighborhood, or smaller division of a city, 
as the civic center is to the city as a whole: 
Prof. Charles Zueblin and Dr. Samuel Crothers read papers on’ 
“The historic antecedents of the social center.” The use of the school 
buildings for nonpartisan gatherings of citizens for public discussion 
was strongly emphasized in the report of the committee. Mr. 
Henry C. Campbell, president of the Milwaukee Federation of Civic 
Societies, remarked: 
It is no exaggeration to say that in making the schoolhouse the forum of the people 
lies the chief hope of perpetuating the Republic and of perfecting its institutions. 
_ Mr. L. S. Richards read a paper on ‘‘The public-school building as 
nonpartisan political headquarters.” He compared the benefits 
flowing from this use of the public-school buildings with the present 
results of the use of saloons for this purpose. The advantages to be 
gained from the permanent installation of voting machines in public- 
school edifices were emphasized. The use of these buildings as polling 
places would serve, it was claimed, as an object lesson in civics to the 
children, also to the foreigners in the evening schools. 
The use of schoolhouses for library purposes, free lecture and 
recreation centers, art galleries, ete., was urged. Mr. Clarence A. 
Perry, of the bureau of school plant utilization inquiry of the Sage 
Foundation, presented a survey of the present status of school, 
extension work in the United States. He reported that over 100 
cities are engaged in the movement, in 18 of which there is extensive 
development. é 
The officers of the league for 1910-11 are as follows: President, 
on. William D, Foulke, Richmond, Ind.; secretary, Mr. Clinton R. 
Woodruff, 703 North American, Philadelphia, Pa.

FARMERS’ INSTITUTE WORKERS. 
The fifteenth annual meeting of the American Association of 
Farmers’ Institute Workers was held at Washington, D. C., Novem- 
ber 14-15, 1910. Many reports from committees were read. The 
importance of movable schools of agriculture as adjuncts to farmers’ 
institutes received much attention. An interesting paper was read 
by Mr. P. C. Parks, of Atlanta, Ga., on the ‘‘Conditions ere 
negro-farmers in the South.” He said: 
We are up against the fact that in spite of all we say to the contrary, agricultural 
production must turn in the last analysis upon the negro farm hand, and if the farm- 
ing efficiency of these farm workers can be gradually raised, we will be working at 
the root of the gravest problem now facing the South, and I may say the whole 
country. 
Mr. Parks emphasized the importance of farming education among 
the masses of negroes in the rural districts, stating that to be 
effective— ¢ 
any organized effort to reach and help the negro farmers must be wisely planned 
and judiciously conducted to suit the needs of both the negroes and white farmers 
in the rural districts.. This means State control and a special department of farmers’ 
institutes for negro farmers. 
The officers of the association for 1911 are as follows: President, 
A. M. Soule, Athens, Ga.; secretary-treasurer, Mr, John Hamilton, 
Department of Agriculture, Washington, D. C. ; 
RURAL LIFE CONFERENCE. 
The fourth Rural Life Conference was held in connection with the 
summer school of the University of Virginia, July 17-21, 1911. 
The conference confined itself mainly to the discussion of coopera- 
tion, woman’s work, and the church in rural neighborhoods. Mr. 
B. H. Crocheron, principal of the Agricultural High School, Sparks, 
Baltimore County, Md., delivered an address on ‘‘Six means for 
improvement of rural schools.’”’ He said: 
Industrial teaching is the most obvious phase of rural school improvement. If 
the business of our farm people is agriculture, it would seem but reasonable that 
. the schools should teach that which will help them most in making a living. The 
old discussion of the value of “book learning” on farms has long ago disappeared 
before the blast of the accumulated knowledge built up in the last 50 years. The 
typical farmer no longer doubts the efficiency of agricultural teaching, but rather 
strives to gain for his children the knowledge which could not be his. The average 
rural teacher can, after some preparation in the elements of agriculture, give instruc- 
tion that will help immensely the experiment stations and colleges in their teaching 
of the more advanced problems. Domestic science for girls is the companion of 
the agricultural course for boys. With a one-burner alcohol stove the rural teacher 
can demonstrate good cookery on a pedagogical basis which the child’s mother must 
have lacked. Manual training and simple carpentry, for boys is both popular and 
practical, for the handy boy is very useful on the farm. 
Addresses were made by Dr. John L. Coulter, of the United States 
Department of Commerce and Labor; Hon. O. B. Martin, United 
States Department of Agriculture; Rev. Henry F. Cope, and others.

   The fifth annual congress of the American School Hygiene Asso- 
-ciation was held in New York City, February 2-4, 1911. Mr. Frank 
Irving Cooper delivered an address on ‘‘Schoolhouses and the laws,” 
illustrated by a chart showing the status of compulsory regulation 
of schoolhouse construction in the United States in 1910. He said: 
So far as can be ascertained only eight States have passed laws worthy of the name 
bearing on schoolhouse construction. Of this number only two States have regu- 
+ lations on fireproof construction, and of this number only one State, Massachusetts, 
has passed. regulations on fire-retarding construction. Sixteen States have passed 
-regulations-controlling the plan, but of 48 States of our country 22 States have no 
laws or regulations whatever to prevent school buildings being built as crematories. 
In a majority of cases the laws as they have been passed state that plans for school 
buildings must be submitted to a superintendent or other authority for approval. 
This means a control by men and not by law. Regulations for the construction of 
school buildings should be specific and should be the law of the land. 
Dr. Luther H. Gulick made an address on ‘‘ What our city schools 
are doing for the health of our children.” 
AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR CONSERVATION OF VISION. 
This association was organized March 25, 1911, in New York City. 
The objects of the association as set forth in the constitution are as 
follows: é 
To study and investigate all conditions and causes which result in blindness or 
impaired vision, 
To determine so far as possible the relation of eye strain to physical and mental 
health-and to. human efficiency. 
To devise and provide ways and means for the prevention of blindness and the con- 
servation of vision. 
To disseminate knowledge concerning all matters pertaining to the care and use of 
the eyes. 
The business affairs of the association will be controlled by an 
executive board of nine managers. Six separate departments will 
investigate eye diseases, industrial environments affecting good vision, 
care of the eyes of school children, legislation, statistics, ete. Each 
department will have a director, who will be appointed by the presi- 
dent and approved by the board. 
The following officers were elected: President, Dr. F. Park Lewis, 
uffalo, N. Y.; secretary, Miss Ida B. Hiltz, New York City. 
UBLIC HEALTH EDUCATION COMMITTEE OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL

nating ‘‘accurate information concerning the nature and prevention 
of disease and the general hygienic welfare of the people.” The com- 
mittee reports having given 1,930 lectures, free from technicalities 
and filled with sound teaching regarding public health. Says the 
report: 
The direct administration of the work has been subdivided and carried on by State 
secretaries and county chairmen. The State secretaries and county chairmen have 
gotten in touch with women’s clubs, Y. M. C. A’s, mothers’ and teachers’ clubs, social 
settlement clubs, etc., and have made up lists of those doctors who would cooperate 
with us by giving lectures on health topics. 
The chairman of the central committee is Dr. Rosalie S. Morton, 
6 East Fifty-eighth Street, New York City, and the secretary, Dr. 
Evelyn Garrigue, 616 Madison Avenue, New York City. 
VIIL EDUCATION OF THE COLORED RACE, 
  
TUSKEGEE NEGRO CONFERENCE. 
The twentieth annual Tuskegee Negro Conference, under the aus- 
pices of the Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute, was held at 
Tuskegee, Ala., January 18-19, 1911. Over 2,000 visitors attended 
the exercises. Not only were farmers present in large numbers, repre- 
senting all the Southern States, but also many prominent educators 
of the South. The chief address was made by Dr. Booker T. Wash- 
ington, principal of the Tuskegee Institute. His remarks on the mort- 
gage and lien system aroused interest. Among other things he said: 
The time has now come when the negro farmer should be so thrifty, so industrious, 
so full handed that he can live for a year or longer without having to go to somebody 
to supply him with food, clothing, animals, and implements to be used while he is 
making his year’s crop. 
Colored farmers throughout the Southern States might as well understand that the 
old methods are passing away and new ones are to take their places. I refer especially 
to that old habit of mortgaging the crop, animals, etc., for the money on which to live 
while the crop is being raised. The negro in the South has been free for more than 45 
years, and it ought not to be necessary much longer for any proportion of them to be 
treated as though they were children instead of men. 
He dwelt on the importance of giving negro farmers better educa- 
tional advantages to the end that the whole South might profit 
thereby. He remarked: 
The old crop lien or mortgage system has proven disastrous and costly both to the 
white man and to the black man, and the only way to get rid of this system is for every 
colored farmer to be so industrious, so thrifty and saving that he will save enough out 
of this year’s crop to live on during the next year without going into debt. 
Tospeak roughly, one-fifth of the farming land in the Southern States is occupied or 
controlled by colored people. This means that, unless the negro farmer gets as much
-P-A-G-E-307
EDUCATION OF THE COLORED RACE. 287 
out of this land as any other class of farmers can get out of their land, that in the same 
degree that they fail to do this the South as a whole will be the poorer. 
The time has come when, in my opinion, the white citizens of the South should 
realize that a very liberal policy should be pursued in connection with the education of 
the negro as a farmer. It is too much to expect that the negro farmer will get the 
best results and succeed without having any money spent on him to make him a more 
successful farmer while thousands of dollars are being spent every year throughout 
the South in the education of the white farmers. 
At the termination of the conference a declaration to the public 
was adopted which summed up many of the results of the 20 annual 
conferences that have been held under the auspices of the Tuskegee 
Institute. The negroes were admonished to continue to build school- 
houses and lengthen the school terms; to see that better teachers and 
ministers are secured; to continue to purchase land and improve the 
homes. 
HAMPTON INSTITUTE. 
The forty-third anniversary of Hampton Normal and Agricultural 
Institute, Hampton, Va., was celebrated on April 26-27, 1911. 
The trade-class program was particularly interesting. The class- 
president address was delivered by Madikane Q. Cele, a Zulu prince 
from Natal, South Africa, who worked his way through the institute 
and acquired the trade of a wheelwright. Addresses were made by a 
number of eminent visitors, among them being Dr. William J. 
Schieffelin, Mr. Robert C. Ogden, Rev. Charles E. Parks, and Lord 
Eustace Percy, of the British Embassy, Washington, D. C. 
On a large wooden revolving platform, divided into 6 sections, 
11 sets of Hampton tradesmen carried on their customary work in 
full view of an audience of over 1,500. Some 30 out of 53 boys of 
the senior trade class were actively employed in groups in shingling 2 
roof, nailing on weatherboards, house painting, fitting a coat, using 
a sewing machine, mending shoes, erecting a brick arch, applying 
white plastering, operating a printing press and a turning lathe, con- 
structing a railroad hand truck, tiring a wheel, installing a bathtub, 
wiping lead joints, and making a picture frame.    
    
             
   
     
   HAMPTON NEGRO CONFERENCE. 
The fifteenth annual meeting of the Hampton Negro Conference 
was held at Hampton Institute, July 19-20, 1911, under the direction 
f Dr. Thomas Jesse Jones, of Hampton Institute and the United 
tates Bureau of the Census, Washington, D. C. The aim of the 
onference was ‘‘to suggest practical ideas and methods for improving 
ace conditions.” The following topics were discussed: ‘‘Women’s 
ork for community betterment”; ‘‘Place of the church in rural 
ife”; ‘Improvement of rural life’; ‘‘Negro organization society of 
irginia”’; and ‘“Cooperation in Virginia.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-308
   288 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
Mrs. Harris Barrett, of Hampton, Va., a graduate of the institute, 
and president of the Virginia federation of colored women, outlined the 
story of the growth of the federation, which was organized in 1907 
at the Hampton Negro Conference. Mrs. Barrett’s report demon- 
strated clearly that the negroes of Virginia have been learning to 
work together to uplift community life. The negro women’s clubs 
which had pledged $10 each for an industrial school for wayward 
girls redeemed their pledges. Mrs. I. C. Norcum, of Portsmouth, 
Va., who is chairman of the ways and means committee of the 
federation, read a paper on ‘‘'Women’s community clubs,” which 
showed the relation of the work of colored women’s clubs to improve- 
ment of the welfare and appointment of the home, including well- 
cooked meals, school-improvement societies, sanitary reforms in rural 
life, care of children, and the antituberculosis movement. 
Dr. S. G. Atkins, secretary of education for the African Methodist 
Episcopal Zion Church, urged that one must investigate the condi- 
tions of the colored people in rural communities to understand why 
so many have drifted into the cities. He contended ‘‘that what 
was mere waywardness in the country youth became crime and 
dissipation when they reached the towns and cities.’’ .He then cited 
six reasons for the movement of negroes to the cities, as follows: 
Decline of parental authority, lack of entertainment in country districts, want of 
good school facilities, so-called ‘‘poor wages,’’ and ignorance of what to do with the 
land. 
Dr. Atkins declared that Hampton Institute should establish a 
form of religious demonstration work to help the negro ministers 
check the movement toward the cities. 
Dr. James H. Dillard, of New Orleans, La., president of the Rural 
School Fund Board, said that the country minister must cease 
ignoring problems of better health, better homes, better schools, and 
better churches. 
Rev. C. L. Bonner, of Toccoa, Ga., spoke of the needs of the negro 
along the ordinary lines of farm life. He reported the introduction 
of farm demonstration work by preacher-demonstrators in his own 
community. 
Prof. W. T. B. Williams, field agent of Hampton Institute, 
described the means employed for getting negro organizations to 
cooperate with the Negro Organization Society, which seeks to 
improve education and health conditions among the colored people 
of Virginia. 
Resolutions dealing with the following topics were unanimously 
adopted: Influence of the negro church upon moral, educational, and 
material welfare of rural communities; betterment of school grounds 
and buildings; ministers’ institutes; cooperation of all organizations

for race advancement; crusade against consumption; better prepara- 
tion of negro school teachers; and the need of stimulating public 
interest in colored schools. 
NEGRO RURAL SCHOOL FUND—ANNA T. JEANES FOUNDATION. 
The board of trustees of the Negro Rural School Fund met at the 
White House in Washington, December 12, 1910. The President of 
the United States presided at the meeting. Dr. James H. Dillard, 
president of the board, spoke of the effective work accomplished 
during the year toward the direct improvement of the country schools. 
When the fund was established, the question arose, ‘‘How best to 
spend, how to make count for most, the resources at the command of 
the board.” Dr. Dillard said: 
The simple suggestion of Mr. Jackson Davis, the superintendent of a county in 
Virginia, pointed the way of putting into effect certain ideas which seemed vital to 
the purpose of the fund. * * * The suggestion of Mr. Davis was that we should 
assist him in injecting the influence of a supervising industrial teacher into the work 
of the country schools in his county. The proposition was promptly accepted, and 
the plan thus inaugurated has been welcomed and approved by many other superin- 
tendents throughout the South. 
Prof. B. C. Caldwell, field agent of the board, reported the expend- 
iture of $2,500 of the income of the fund— 
in helping country schools to build and equip houses, mostly industrial rooms, 
kitchens, and shops, and $750 in helping to extend the school term. The rest of the 
money was spent for teachers’ salaries. The calls for Jeanes teachers have been so 
many and so urgent this year that practically the whole available income for the year 
has been appropriated for salaries of teachers. 
The Jeanes teachers are reaching about two thousand rural school 
teachers and about a hundred thousand country children. While 
these instructors are paid by the Jeanes foundation, they are chosen 
and appointed by the county superintendents, and do their work 
under the direction of the county school officers. 
The total number of teachers, supervisors, and organizers for the 
year 1910-11 was 103, distributed as follows:

NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF TEACHERS IN COLORED £CHOOLS. 
The eighth annual session of the association was held at St. Louis, 
Mo., July 26-30, 1911. The meeting emphasized the importance of 
constructive work on the part of the colored people and the whites 
who are interested in their progress. Conditions were set forth 
regarding the short school terms so prevalent in colored schools, the 
inadequate salaries of teachers, the lack of supervision, the wide- 
spread neglect. of proper equipment for schools, and the almost com- 
plete absence of public high schools and real normal schools to prepare 
teachers for the elementary schools. 
The president of the association is Mr. W. T. B. Williams, a field 
agent of Hampton Institute and of the Slater and Jeanes funds. Dr. 
Booker T. Washington delivered the closing address to an audience of 
9,000 people. 
NATIONAL NEGRO BUSINESS LEAGUE. 
The meetings of the National Negro Business League, held at 
Little Rock, Ark., were largely attended. Dr. Booker T. Washington, 
president of the league, delivered an addiess, on August 17, 1911, 
before an audience of 2,000 people, 700 of them white. He estimated 
the value of all products of negro farmers in the South during the 
year 1910 to have been $500,000,000, and the total earnings of negroes 
in other callings at $200,000,000. ‘‘How many of these millions of 
dollars to-day,’’ he asked, ‘“‘remain in our hands?” He declared it the 
paramount duty of the negro minister, the negro teacher, the negro 
business man, of the leaders of the Negro race everywhere, to see to it 
that a larger proportion of the tremendous amount earned by the 
_ race is invested in lands, houses, banks, schools, industrial institu- 
tions, colleges, churches, ‘‘so invested that it will remain for all time 
in the possession of this generation and succeeding generations.” 
If 10 per cent only of our annual earnings were set aside for such investment as J] 
have suggested, the race would have every year $70,000,000 which would go into i 
permanent enrichment and enlightenment. There is another feature of race develop 
ment to which I can not fail to call your attention at this time. This refers to thi 
matter of seeing to it that the youths of the race in a larger measure prepare them. 
selves for service in the fundamental skilled trades. Too large a proportion of youth: 
are content with little odd jobs, or hand-to-mouth callings. 
Dr. Joseph A. Booker, president of the Arkansas Baptist College 
Little Rock, Ark., spoke on ‘‘ Negro school building by negroes.’ Fo 
25 years Dr. Booker has presided over the destinies of a distinctl, 
negro school. He asserted that the Arkansas Baptist College was fo 
the most part erected by the pennies and nickels and dimes of washer

women and laboring men, and was an object lesson of self help among 
the negroes of the South. Twenty-five years ago the college possessed 
nought save the name; it now owns property in Little Rock valued 
at between $60,000 and $70,000 and a $10,000 farm north of the city.

EXCHANGE PROFESSORS. 
An exchange of professors was established in 1904 between Harvard 
University and the University of Berlin, and was extended by the 
action of the Prussian minister of public instruction to other uni- 
versities of the Kingdom. 
The exchange between Columbia University and the University 
of Berlin was instituted in 1906 by the endowment at the latter of 
the Theodore Roosevelt professorship of American history and 
institutions. This was followed by the establishment of the Kaiser 
Wilhelm professorship of German history and institutions, to be 
filled each year by the trustees of Columbia University upon the 
nomination of the Prussian ministry of education. Similar arrange- 
ments have been perfected between the two American universities 
named and the University of Paris. The system of exchanges is 
extending to other universities. It may be noted, also, that several 
universities of this country have lectureships which are either filled 
occasionally by foreign scientific men and scholars, or which are 
annually filled by foreign appointments. The following exchanges 
have been announced for 1911-12: 
Theobold Smith, Ph. B., M. D., A. M., LL. D., professor of com- 
parative pathology, will represent Harvard University at the Uni- 
versity of Breslau. 
Prof. Dr. Willy Kukenthal, director of the zoological institute and - 
museum, University of Breslau, in exchange will lecture at Harvard. 
The lectureship established by Mr. James H. Hyde, of New York 
City, at the Sorbonne, Paris, will be filled by W. M. Davis, M. E., 
S. D., Ph. D., Sturgis-Hooper professor of geology at Harvard 
University. In exchange Prof. Charles Diehl will represent the 
University of Paris at Harvard. The subject of his lectures will be 
Byzantine history. 
The trustees of Columbia University have nominated as the 
Theodore Roosevelt professor at the University of Berlin Paul S. 
Reinsch, Ph. D., professor of political science at the University of 
Wisconsin. 
The Kaiser Wilhelm professor is Josef Schick, Ph. D., professor of 
English philology in the University of Munich. 
 
-P-A-G-E-312
  292 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
The University of Paris will be represented at Columbia University 
by Prof. Gustave Lanson, Litt. D., associate dean of the faculty of 
letters of the University of Paris, member of the Conseil Supérieure 
de L’Instruction Publique. 
Members of the Germanistic Society of Chicago have for several 
years past provided funds which have enabled the University of 
Chicago to carry on an exchange with German institutions. 
In accordance with that plan, Prof. Hermann Oncken, of the Uni- 
versity of Giessen, now of the University of Berlin, lectured in the 
department of history of the University of Chicago for six months, 
during the autumn quarter of 1905 and the winter quarter of 1906. 
Prof. J. Laurence Laughlin, head of the department of political 
economy, gave lectures in Berlin during the spring semester of 1906, 
one before the University of Berlin and seven before “Die Verein- 
igung fir Staatswissenschaftliche Fortbildung,”’ and three lectures 
also before a similar organization in Cologne. 
Dr. Heinrich August Alexander Kraeger, professor of the history of 
literature and art at the Royal Academy of Art in Dusseldorf, 
lectured in the University of Chicago throughout the autumn quarter 
of 1906 and the winter quarter of 1907. 
Prof. Ernst Daenell, Ph. D., professor extraordinarius in the de- 
partment of modern history of the University of Kiel, lectured in 
the University of Chicago throughout the autumn quarter of 1908. 
Prof. John Matthews Manly, head of the department of English, 
University of Chicago, conducted courses in the history of the drama 
during the spring semester of 1909 in the University of Géttingen. 
Prof. Dr. Lorenz Morsbach, professor of English philology in the 
University of Gottingen, lectured in the University of Chicago during 
the autumn quarter of 1910. 
Prof. A. A. Michelson, head of the department of physics (Chicago), 
lectured before the University of Géttingen during the spring semes- 
ter of 1911. 
The matter is arranged between the University of Chicago and the 
Germanistic Society of Chicago on the one hand and the Department 
of Education of Berlin on the other. 
The University of La Plata and the University of Michigan have 
arranged for cooperation in the work of the astronomical observa- 
tories. Prof. W. J. Hussey has been appointed director of La Plata 
Observatory, but is still to remain director of the observatory of the 
University of Michigan. He will divide his time equally between 
the two institutions, spending the second semester of each year at 
Ann Arbor.

RELATIONS BETWEEN AMERICAN AND SCANDINAVIAN UNIVERSITIES. 
Through the influence of the American-Scandinavian Society, the 
“movement for the exchange of professors and students with Scandi- 
navian countries is extending. This work will be fostered by the 
increased resources of the society through a recent bequest made in 
the will of its late president, Mr. Niels Poulson, president of the 
Hecla Iron Works, Brooklyn, N. Y. During his life Mr. Poulson 
donated $100,000 for the purposes of the society, and by his will left 
it the residue of his estate. Shortly before his death, which occurred 
May 3 of the current year, the American-Scandinavian Foundation 
was incorporated by a special act at Albany, N. Y., to handle the 
funds which he had donated. It is understood that the income of 
the foundation will be largely used for student exchange between 
the Scandinavian countries and the United States, and in other ways 
to promote closer relations between those nations. It is not proba- 
ble that the professor exchange will be continued by the organization, 
as that movement seems now to have been taken up by the univer- 
sities themselves. 
PERSIAN-AMERICAN EDUCATIONAL SOCIETY. 
The Persian-American Educational Society, an organization which 
seeks to establish closer relations between Persia and America, met 
in Washington, D. C., June 16-17, 1911. The annual report of the ~ 
society was submitted by Joseph H. Hannen, showing the progress 
that had been made in extending knowledge of Persian art and 
industry in the United States. Addresses were made by Mirza Ali 
Kuli Khan, chargé d’affaires of the Persian Legation in Washington; 
and Dr. ElmerE. Brown, United States Commissioner of Education, and 
others. A resolution was adopted recommending the appointment 
by the Persian Parliament of an educational commission to visit the 
United States to study its public-school system. The following 
officers were elected: William H. Hoar, president, Fanwood, N. J.; 
Joseph H. Hannen, secretary, Washington, D. C. 
EXCHANGE BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND JAPAN. 
An exchange of professors between the United States and Japan 
has been arranged on the following basis: Seven American univer- 
sities—Yale, Columbia, Johns Hopkins, Virginia, Illinois, Brown, 
and Minnesota—are to contribute $500 each in order to send an 
American representative to the University of Japan every other 
year. In exchange Japan will send, biennially, a representative to 
the United States to spend four weeks in each of the participating 
universities. 'The American representative is to be selected by the 
presidents of these institutions, but he may or may not be connected 
with any one of them.
-P-A-G-E-314
  294 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
The Japanese representative for 1911-12 is Dr. Ignazo Nitobe, 
professor of colonial politics in the University of Tokyo, and formerly 
a student at Johns Hopkins University, the University of Bonn, and 
the University of Brussels. 
FOREIGN PROFESSORS AT THE LOWELL INSTITUTE. 
It is of interest to note in this connection that Dr. Franz Cumont, 
president of the Archeological Society of Brussels, has delivered a 
series of lectures before the Lowell Institute on the archeological 
explorations in the Tigris-Euphrates Valley, and before the same 
institution Dr. George A. Reisner, of Cambridge University, Eng- 
land, has delivered a course of lectures on Egyptian archeology. 
THE KAHN FOUNDATION. 
The Kahn Foundation was established several years ago by 
M. Albert Kahn, a prominent banker of Paris, for the purpose of 
sending a few representative teachers into foreign lands for travel, 
in order to increase their knowledge of languages and broaden the 
scope of their acquaintance and sympathies. Funds for this pur- 
pose were established in France, Germany, Japan, and England. 
During the past year the United States was included among the 
beneficiaries of the foundation. The American trustees are as 
follows: Mr. Edward D. Adams, Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler, and 
Dr. Henry F. Osborn, of New York City; Dr. Charles W. Eliot, of 
Cambridge, Mass.; and Dr. Charles D. Walcott, of Washington, D. C. 
On July 1, 1911, the first Bourses de Voyage became available for 
American teachers, and the first two boursiers, or fellows, selected 
were Dr. John H. T. McPherson, professor of history and political 
science at the University of Georgia, Athens, Ga., and Dr. Francis 
Daniels, professor of Romance languages at Wabash College, Craw- 
fordsville, Ind. An absence from home of at least one year, includ- 
ing in the itinerary not only Europe but Egypt, India, Japan, and 
other countries of the Orient, is the suggestion of the founder of the 
trust. Each boursier is expected to submit a written report to the 
trustees, giving his impressions of the places visited. 
ASSOCIATION OF COSMOPOLITAN CLUBS. 
The international or cosmopolitan club movement in many of the 
colleges and universities of the United States is one of world-wide 
significance. The membership is composed chiefly of the foreign- 
born students at our institutions of higher education—students com- 
ing from neighboring American States, from Europe, Asia, Africa, 
and Australasia. The history of the movement is an interesting one. 
The first club of this kind was formed at the University of Wisconsin. 
Mr. Louis P. Lochner, general secretary of the Association of Cosmo-
-P-A-G-E-315
  INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS. 295 
politan Clubs, in an article contributed to the Review of Reviews, 
March, 1908, writes as follows: 
On the evening of March 12, 1903, 16 foreign students of the University of Wisconsin, 
representing 11 different nationalities, gathered in the modest little apartments of 
Karl Kawakami, a Japanese student. An international club was to be organized in 
which all foreigners of the university, rich and poor, were to meet on an equal basis 
of mutual friendship and brotherhood. No similar organization at any other univer- 
sity furnished them a precedent. The action of these 16 men was original, unsolicited, 
and unprecedented. H. Hagopian, an Armenian, headed the organization; a Nor- 
wegian was its first vice president; a Japanese, a South American, and a German, 
respectively, filled the offices of secretary, treasurer, and censor. 
From a nucleus of 16 students in 1903, the cosmopolitan club movement has devel- 
oped to a powerful body of over 2,000 young men, representing almost 60 different 
countries in 1910. 
A writer in the Cosmopolitan Annual, 1908, says: 
In every case the purpose of these international clubs has been to bring closer 
together men from different countries, to learn the customs, viewpoints, and charac- 
teristics of other nationalities, to remove national prejudices, and to establish inter- 
national friendship. 
Cornell University, on November 30, 1904, formed a cosmopolitan 
club. The University of Michigan followed in January, 1906; the 
University of Illinois in October, 1906; Purdue in September, 1907; 
Louisiana in October, 1907; Ohio State in October, 1907; and 
Chicago in November, 1907. Since the year 1907 students of many 
other institutions have organized cosmopolitan clubs. The Harvard 
Cosmopolitan Club, which was founded February 12, 1908, has over 
200 members. The club at Cornell has erected a building which 
cost $50,000. Twenty-six clubs are now affiliated with the national 
organization, one of them a Canadian chapter, and nine are about 
to apply for membership. 
On December 28-30, 1907, delegates from all existing clubs met 
at the University of Wisconsin to organize an association of cosmo- 
politan clubs. A permanent union was effected, and a constitution 
and by-laws were adopted. The University of Wisconsin Interna- 
tional Club was made the executive chapter, and the Cornell Club 
the recording chapter. 
Article II of the constitution declared: 
The object of the association shall be to unite and strengthen the existing chapters, 
to promote the organization of chapters in other colleges and universities, to cultivate 
the arts of peace, to establish strong international friendships, and to carry out the 
motto of the association, ‘‘Above all Nations is Humanity.” 
This association shall be nonpartisan and nonsectarian. 
At the third annual convention of the association, held at Cornell 
University, Ithaca, N. Y., December, 1909, an important step was 
advocated. It was tentatively proposed that an affiliation be formed 
with Corda Fratres, an organization with similar aims to those of the 
American society, and whose membership includes 60,000 students
-P-A-G-E-316
  296 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
in the universities of Europe. At the fourth annual convention, held 
at the University of Illinois, Urbana, Ill., December 28-31, 1910, the 
pros and cons of a world federation under the Corda Fratres banner 
were debated. The final decision was postponed until the fifth 
annual convention in 1911. There is a strong possibility that such 
an amalgamation will be effected. It was decided to send four dele- 
gates of the association to the meeting of the Corda Fratres to take 
place at Rome in 1911, ‘‘for the purpose on the one hand of more 
fully acquainting our European brothers with our aims and purposes, 
and on the other hand of becoming more fully informed with reference 
to Corda Fratres.” 
The cosmopolitan club leaders have already rendered signal service 
to the Corda Fratres. Mrs. Lucia Ames Mead, in a pamphlet pub- 
lished by the International School of Peace, Boston, Mass., entitled 
“Educational organization promoting international friendship,” 
writes as follows concerning the affair: 
At the last biennial meeting of the Corda Fratres, held at The Hague in August, 
1909, representatives of our cosmopolitan clubs, at a critical period in the history of 
Corda Fratres, when two elements were discordant, were asked to act as umpires, and 
succeeded so admirably that the society took a new lease of life. Its central bureau 
is to remain no longer in the hands of one nationality, but must be moved about. In 
1911 the bureau will come to America. This international federation of students, 
whose motto, ‘‘Corda Fratres,’’ gives it its title, was founded at Turin in 1898, but not 
very successfully organized until September, 1905, at Liege, Belgium. At first the 
federation had been divided into national sections, but last year it was reorganized, 
so as to discard national lines and to form self-governing local associations as the units 
of the federation. This has 63 local chapters, with 15,000 members of various Euro- 
pean universities, though few, if any, in Germany and England. With the accession 
of 40,000 French students and our cosmopolitan clubs, their numbers nearly tripled 
in 1909. The principal object of the international federation of students is ‘‘to pro- 
tect and promote the idea of solidarity and fraternity among students.’’ -Any student, 
regardless of his political or religious ideas, has a right to become a member if he is 
registered in an institution of higher learning. Each member pledges himself to pro- 
mote the spirit of international union among the youth and to try to “dissipate the 
prejudices and hatred which render states reciprocally hostile and always on a war 
footing,’’ and to promote the work of peace and arbitration between nations. _ It is 
also the object of the federation “‘to put in correspondence the students themselves’’ 
and-to “insure reciprocally hosts and friends in the large cities upon the occasion of 
travel.’’ The official language of the federation is French, together with the language 
of the country where the congress is held. International congresses are held once 
in two years. Austrians, Italians, and French have hitherto been most in evidence 
in the work of the federation. No practical results have as yet been achieved which 
equal those of the American cosmopolitan clubs. With the cooperation of this able 
body on this side of the Atlantic and with the eloquent Mr. Pierre Julian as president, 
it gives promise of great usefulness. Its executive committee has representatives 
from France, Italy, Hungary, Holland, Sweden, United States, and South America. © 
Every second term an American will be awarded the international presidency. 
The fifth convention of the association will be held at Purdue 
University, La Fayette, Ind., in December, 1911.

    TURKISH STUDENTS IN THE UNITED STATES. 
Through the agency of the American ambassador at Constanti- 
nople, acting in accordance with advices from the State Department, 
the attention of the Turkish Government has been directed to facili- 
ties offered by American universities for the education of students 
whom the Turkish Government has arranged to place in foreign 
universities. Several of the leading universities of this country have 
agreed to give free tuition to a certain number of students from 
Turkey designated by their Government, and in accordance with 
these arrangements three students selected by examinations held at 
Constantinople and two others have already been sent, at the expense 
of the Ottoman Government, to Columbia University, New York 
City. It is understood that four of the number are Moslems and 
one a Greek, but the aim of all is to prepare themselves for usefulness 
in their native country. 
CHINESE STUDENTS IN THE UNITED STATES. 
As a result of agreements between this Government and the Gov- 
ernment of China, growing out of the action of Congress providing for 
the remission of a portion of the Chinese indemnity for losses and 
expenses incurred in the Boxer disturbances of 1900, the policy was 
adopted by the Chinese Government of sending students to the 
United States. This action on the part of the Government was sup- 
plemented by provincial authorities in China, and as a consequence 
the number of Chinese students coming to the United States for edu- 
cation has reached important proportions. Experience showed the 
necessity of insuring that the students selected should be fully able 
to profit by the opportunity thus afforded, and consequently special 
examinations were ordered by the Chinese Government as the basis 
of selection. Recently an institution (the Tsing Hwa-yuan Academy) 
has been established at Pekin, in which the Government has instituted 
a special course of study for students to be sent abroad, and after the 
present year the students sent to the United States will be selected 
from those who have pursued the special course in this academy. 
There are at present between eight and nine hundred Chinese students 
in the higher institutions of the United States, of whom about one- 
half are Government students supported by the different Provinces 
and by the remitted part of the Boxer indemnity fund. It is an 
interesting fact that among the teachers chosen by the Chinese 
overnment for the instruction of students in the Pekin Academy 
10 of the men and 8 of the women are Americans.

CHAPTER VII. 
PROGRESS IN INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION DURING THE 
YEAR 1910-11. 
By Cartes R. RicHarps, 
Director of Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, New York City. 
IMPORTANT EVENTS OF THE YEAR. 
Perhaps the most significant and fruitful happening in the field 
of industrial education during the year 1910-11 was the visit to this 
country under the auspices of the National Society for the Promo- 
tion of Industrial Education of Dr. Georg Kerschensteiner, superin- 
tendent of schools, Munich, Bavaria. Dr. Kerschensteiner’s work 
in developing the remarkable system of industrial continuation 
schools in Munich has received much attention for several years 
from American educators, and his presentation of the history, 
administration, and economic results of these schools before audi- 
ences composed of manufacturers, business men, and teachers in 
six of the largest cities of the country, aroused a high degree of 
interest. The point that undoubtedly made the deepest impression 
upon his audiences is the fact that the central principle of the 
Munich organization is a working cooperation between employers 
and the public-school system, a cooperation that not only makes 
toward the solution of the economic problems involved, but one 
which leads to the highest efficiency in the instruction. Dr. Kersch- 
ensteiner’s visit unquestionably did much to increase the already 
growing conviction as to the great importance and practical value 
of the day continuation or part-time school as an element in the 
future development of industrial education under American con- 
ditions, and it has been increasingly evident since his visit that the 
thought of those concerned with the development of this work in 
the United States is turning more and more in this direction. 
Dr. Kerschensteiner’s visit was followed closely by the fourth 
annual convention of the National Society for the Promotion of 
Industrial Education in Boston, November 17, 18, and 19. This 
convention was extremely encouraging in the interest shown through 
the large attendance and in the high order of the papers presented. 
On the evening of November 17 a banquet was tendered by the 
Boston Chamber of Commerce to those attending the convention; 
299

No. 13. Part I. Trade Education for Girls. 
Part II. Apprenticeship and Corporation Schools. 
Part III. Part-time and Evening Schools. 
Part IV. The Social Significance of Industrial Education. 
No. 14. The Trade Continuation Schools of Munich. 
On account of the great confusion as to the nomenclature used 
in discussions on industrial education, the executive committee of 
the society has felt compelled to attempt the formulation of a brief 
terminology involving the more important distinctions. This 
terminology, which has been adopted by the committee, is as follows: 
Vocational Education includes all forms of specialized education, 
the controlling purposes of which are to fit for useful occupations.
-P-A-G-E-321
  PROGRESS IN INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION IN 1910-11. 301 
Vocational Schools in a broad sense include all commercial, agri- 
cultural, industrial, household arts, and professional schools with 
the above purposes. 
Industrial Education denotes the field of vocational education 
designed to meet the needs of the manual worker in the trades and 
industries, including the occupations of girls and women carried on 
in workshops. 
Agricultural Education is that form of vocational education which 
fits for the occupations connected with the tillage of the soil, the 
care of domestic animals, forestry, and other useful work on the farm. 
Household Arts Education is that form of vocational education 
which fits for occupations connected with the household. 
Manual Training is the training of the hand, especially by means 
of the tools which are used in various industrial processes, employed 
as an agent in general education. 
Manual Training High Schools (Mechanic Arts Schools, sometimes 
called Technical High Schools).—Manual training had its beginning 
30 years ago in secondary schools with four distinct avowed objects 
in view: (1) To educate the whole boy, to develop the entire area of 
his brain; (2) to lay a broad and appropriate foundation for higher 
education; (3) to enable a boy to discover his innate mental and 
physical aptitudes; (4) to furnish a broad basis for an industrial career 
should one’s aptitude lie in the direction of the mechanical arts. It 
admitted only boys of 14 years or more who had finished the gram- 
mar grades—the average was about 15. 
Manual training high schools are defined in the report of the com- 
mittee on the place of industries in public education made to the 
National Education Association in 1910 as follows: 
The manual training high school, or the manual training school, is a school of sec- 
ondary grade in which a greater or less amount of handwork is included in the curricu- 
lum and in which the greater part of the academic instruction is similar to that found 
in other high schools and college-preparatory schools, neither the manual nor the 
academic instruction being especially planned to be of direct vocational service. 
It is evident that manual training schools as represented by the 
above definitions are not vocational schools as previously defined. 
Industrial Schools include all special schools (a) that prepare for 
entrance into industrial employment and schools (6) that give supple- 
mentary instruction to those already engaged in such employment. 
Trade Preparatory Schools (General Industrial Schools, Interme- 
mediate Industrial Schools, Pre-apprenticeship Schools) —Trade 
preparatory schools are schools that offer training for boys and girls 
between 14 and 16 years of age in practical industrial processes, in- 
cluding such drawing, science, and mathematics as will prepare them 
for entrance into the trades or industries as efficient beginners. 
Trade Schools are schools that afford specialized practical training 
in manual trades, with the object of preparing for immediate prac-
-P-A-G-E-322
  802 : EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
tical work at the trade as a wage earner. Such schools aim to take 
the place of apprenticeship in whole or in part. 
Technical Schools are schools giving training in practical indus- 
trial processes and which .at the same time offer advanced instruc- 
tion in the scientific and mathematical principles upon which these 
processes are based. 
Technical High Schools are public schools of secondary grade hay- 
ing the distinct purpose of preparing pupils for industrial careers 
requiring scientific and technical knowledge beyond that needed by 
the skilled mechanic. 
Continuation Schools—1. Evening Continuation Schools. Eve- 
ning continuation schools are schools attended by those already 
engaged in useful employment which provide instruction directly 
related to such employment. Such instruction may consist of either 
practical work, related subjects of study, or both. 
2. Part-time Schools or Day Continuation Schools. Part-time or 
day continuation schools are schools for persons (commonly ap- 
prentices or other learners) engaged in-useful employment, which 
give instruction supplementary to such employment during a por- 
tion of the working time of the pupils. 
Cooperative Schools are schools conducted under an agreement be- 
tween the school and an employing establishment, by which students 
entered in school are given opportunities for practical work in the 
establishment for a portion of their time. 
Another important publication of the year in this field is the 
report of the ‘Place of Industries in Public Education,’’ prepared 
by a committee of the National Education Association and sub- 
mitted to the national council of that body meeting in Boston July, 
1910. This report, after introductory papers on the “Industrial 
Factor in Social Progress,’”’ the ‘Industrial Factor in Education,” 
and ‘Notes on History of Industrial Education in the United States,” 
presents the findings of three subcommittees, as follows: (1) ‘On 
the Place of Industries in the Elementary School,’ (2) ‘On 
Intermediate Industrial Schools,” (3) ‘On Industrial and Tech- 
nical Education in the Secondary School.” This report, which was 
signed by Jesse D. Burks, chairman; Charles R. Richards, secretary; 
Edgar S. Barney, Howard D. Brundage, Flora J. Cooke, Arthur D. 
Dean, William H. Elson, Carleton B. Gibson, Calvin N. Kendall, 
Ernest B. Kent, Charles H. Keyes, E. Euphrosyne Langley, Frank M. 
Leavitt, George A. Merrill, Charles H. Morse, Carroll G. Pearse, 
David S. Snedden, and Charles F. Warner, aimed at a valuation of 
the present tendencies in industrial education and a constructive 
study of the fields of work that lie most clearly within the province 
of public-school administration. Emphasis upon differentiated voca- 
tional work in the upper grades of the grammar schools, importance

of the intermediate industrial schools, and the need for definitely 
vocational high schools stand out as the salient features of the report. 
LEGISLATION FOR INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION. 
The year 1910-11 has witnessed a substantial advance in legisla- 
tive and other practical measures looking to the development of 
industrial education in the United States. In Massachusetts, which 
has taken the lead in State activity in this field, important steps 
were taken during the year. Perhaps first among these was the 
passage of a néw act by the legislature which has materially altered 
the conditions under which State support may be obtained by indus- 
trial schools. By the terms of the original act of 1906, amended in 
1909, a community could obtain the assistance of the State toward 
the maintenance of industrial schools only by constituting an inde- 
pendent board of trustees to manage such schools. By the new act 
industrial schools may hereafter be established under the local school 
board, which has entire freedom to control such schools, provided 
they bear the burden of support. Such schools, however, may 
obtain the benefit of the State’s aid and remain under the direction 
of the local board if they conform to the standards set up by the 
State board of education and are approved by that body. 
Another important legislative action during the year was the 
passage of a resolve appropriating $7,000 for an investigation into 
the possibilities of part-time instruction for the State of Massachu- 
setts. This investigation was placed in the hands of the State board 
of education, who are to make a report by January 1, 1913. 
In January, 1911, the State board of education issued a report upon 
the problem of agricultural education in Massachusetts. The con- 
structive feature of this report was a recommendation that part-time 
schools be established in which the pupil should devote a portion of 
his time to systematic work and tabulation of results upon a part of 
the home farm, leaving the school instruction to deal with the scien- 
tific principles involved, agricultural methods, and a study of the 
student’s experimental results. 
One of the incidental but valuable features of the report was a 
series of definitions as to the terminology of vocational education 
with a view toward an exact interpretation of such terms when used 
in cities of Massachusetts and in rulings of the State board of educa- 
tion. Of still further value in this direction is a bulletin published 
by the State board in September, 1911, defining in exact terms the 
standards as to school organization, courses of study, and methods 
of instruction necessary to secure the approval of proposed schools 
by the board and the award of State moneys. 
Among the independent industrial schools started during the year 
in Massachusetts are the School for Printing in Boston, where another 
 
-P-A-G-E-324

and larger school for several industries is about to be opened; a 
school at Lowell dealing with the textile industry; a school for boys 
and one for girls at Somerville; a school for boys at Springfield; a 
school for boys at Westfield; and one for girls at Worcester. These 
schools are all of the preparatory trade-school type, taking pupils at 
14 years of age, and are in addition to the important schools pre- 
viously established at New Bedford, Beverly, and Worcester. 
In connection with the independent trade school at Worcester, 
part-time classes were inaugurated during the year by which appren- 
tice boys in the machine trade spend one-half a day of four hours 
each week at school. During this time they receive instruction 
according as they elect either in English, shop computations, drawing, 
and lectures on shop practices, or in practical machine work. This 
system has been in operation for about a year and some 57 boys 
have been enrolled in the classes. These classes are held during a 
portion of the working day in time paid for by the employer. 
A number of industrial evening schools were also established under 
the control of the State board during the year in various industrial 
centers. Attendance upon these schools is limited by statute to 
youth over 17 years of age and to those who are employed during the 
working day. 
One of the questions that has exercised the attention of the State 
officers in Massachusetts is that of extending the State supervisory 
control over students in cooperative schools during the period they 
are engaged at work in commercial shops. The State board is of the 
opinion that such control is extremely desirable, if not necessary, in 
order to insure the fullest efficiency of the combined theoretical and 
practical instruction afforded by such schools. 
In New York State the education law has been revised during the 
past year and the law relating to industrial and trade schools passed 
in 1908 has had a section added which concerns ‘‘schools of agricul- 
ture, mechanic arts, and home making,” open to pupils who have com- 
pleted the elementary school course or who have attained the age of 
14 or have met such other requirements as local school authorities 
may have prescribed. 
Syllabi have been developed by the State education department 
for use in intermediate industrial schools covering the subjects of 
industrial and commercial geography, industrial arithmetic, mechan- 
ical drawing, and home making. Syllabiin farm mechanics, dairying, 
animal husbandry, farm crops, etc., have also been developed for the 
agricultural schools. 
There are at present 35 industrial and trade schools in the State, 
employing 145 teachers, with a day enrollment of 3,370 pupils and an 
evening enrollment of 2,933 pupils. 
 
-P-A-G-E-325
  
PROGRESS IN INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION IN 1910-11. 3805 
The State has definitely undertaken to train teachers for vocational 
work. Recognizing the fact that no one type of school is competent 
to deal with the problem, this work is being carried on in three State 
normal schools. One of these institutions has an evening training 
school for mechanics who are fitting themselves as teachers. The 
emphasis in these teachers’ courses is placed upon the planning of 
courses of work and equipment; upon instruction in shop mathe- 
matics, electricity, and mechanics; and, finally, upon methods of 
teaching industrial subjects. One of the normal schools has a course 
in training teachers of agriculture. The work of this school is not 
intended to rival that of the agricultural colleges, but to prepare 
Geachers to carry on any of the scientific work related to agriculture 
outlined in the syllabus of the department. 
Following legislation in Massachusetts, New York, and Connecticut, 
the State of Wisconsin has taken vigorous steps in this direction. In 
this State a commission upon plans for the extension of industrial and 
agricultural education, created by resolution of the legislature in 
1909, submitted its report in January, 1911. In this report the 
commission analyze various practical measures calculated to reach 
and assist the great mass of young workers engaged or about to 
engage in the industries and agriculture. As a result of their inves- 
, tigations and deliberations the commission presented a very earnest 
and emphatic plea for day continuation schools and for compulsory 
attendance upon such schools. Their recommendation in this matter 
is as follows:    
   
                                       
   
              
     
    
   
       
    That as soon as school facilities can be provided for children between 14 and 16 
| years of age already in industry they be compelled to go to school a specified time 
each week; that this time shall be expended as far as possible in industrial training; 
end that the hours of labor for such children shall not exceed eight hours per day 
for six days of each week, which time shall include the time spent by each student 
ia vocational schools. 
Other recommendations of the commission upon this subject are: 
That a temporary State advisory board for industrial education be appointed by 
the governor and that an assistant and other officers whose duty it shall be to super- 
vise and encourage industrial education shall be added to the State superintendent’s 
office, said assistant to be appointed by the State superintendent with the approval. 
of the board of industrial education. That there be established in every community 
where industrial education is undertaken local boards of the same general nature as 
the temporary State advisory board, which board shall have similar control in their 
localities over industrial education and evening schools. That after careful investi- 
gation by the boards established for this purpose continuation schools, trade schools, 
and evening schools shall be gradually established in the State, and that State aid 
shall be given for these Purposes, under strict limitations as to methods and in such 
ja manner that all training given in such schools can be combined into a harmonious 
land economical system.

  806 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
As a result of this report the Legislature of Wisconsin passed a 
number of acts which became laws May 19 of the current year. 
These laws provide that when any school board shall decide to 
establish a trade school or schools a tax not exceeding three-tenths 
of a mill upon the dollar shall be levied upon the total assessed value 
of property in the city and used for the establishment and maintenance 
of the trade school; that the apprenticeship laws of the State shall 
be amended so as to prescribe that every apprentice shall receive 
instruction not less than five hours a week in English, in citizenship, 
business practice, physiology, hygiene, the use of safety devices, and 
such other branches as may be approved by the State board of 
industrial education, and that such instruction may be given in the 
public school; that whenever any evening school, continuation class, 
industrial school or ‘course shall be established for minors between 
the ages of 14 and 16 working under the local board, every such 
child shall attend such school not less than five hours per week for 
six months in each year, and every employer shall allow all minor 
employees over 14 and under 16 years of age a corresponding reduc- 
tion in hours of work; that employers shall allow a reduction of hours 
of work at the time when the classes are held whenever the working 
time and that of the class coincide; that illiterate minors shall attend 
public evening or continuation schools; that no State aid shall be 
granted to any school for instruction in agriculture, domestic 
economy, manual training, or industrial branches unless the salary 
paid to every teacher instructing in such subjects be at least $60 
per month; that a State board of industrial education be created, 
to consist of three designated educators, ex officio, and six appointed 
members, of whom three shall be employers of labor and three shall 
be skilled employees, and that this board shall have control over all 
State aid given under the act; that the State superintendent of 
public instruction shall appoint an assistant in the department. of 
instruction, to be known as assistant for industrial education; that 
in every town or village or city of over 5,000 inhabitants there shall 
be, and in towns, cities, and villages of less than 5,000 inhabitants 
there may be, a ‘local board of industrial education whose duty it 
shall be to foster and establish and maintain industrial, commercial, 
continuation, and evening schools, and that such board shall consist 
of the superintendent of schools and four other members, two 
employers and two employees, who shall be appointed by the local 
board charged with the supervision of the schools and who shall 
serve without pay; that no State aid shall be granted to any school 
under this act without the approval of the local board of education, 
and that no money appropriated by the city, town, or village for 
these schools shall be spent without the approval of ce local board 
of education; that whenever 25 persons qualified to attend an indus-
-P-A-G-E-327

trial, commercial, continuation, or evening school file a petition 
therefor with the local board of education, the board shall establish 
such school or schools or provide other facilities, as authorized in 
this act. 
_. These legal measures represent the most pronounced recognition 
of the part-time continuation schools that has yet entered into 
legislative enactment. It goes without saying that the progress 
made by Wisconsin in developing this particular type of industrial 
education will be watched with great interest by the rest of the 
country. 
Maine is a State not prominent in manufacturing which has also 
adopted measures for industrial education. The legislature of 1911 
passed a “Special Act for the Encouragement of Industrial Educa- 
tion.” Many of the provisions of this act look to the extension of 
manual training, household arts, and agricultural instruction in the 
elementary schools and in normal schools, but section 7 relates 
directly to the establishment of industrial or preparatory trade 
schools: 
The superintending school committee of any town when authorized by vote of the 
town shall establish and maintain as a part of the public-school system of such town 
a general industrial school for the teaching of agriculture, household science, the 
mechanic arts, and the trades. Such general industrial schools shall be open to 
pupils who have completed the elementary school course or who have attained the 
age of fifteen years. Such schools must be supported by funds raised in addition to 
the usual funds for the schools. The State will aid such a school to the amount of 
two-thirds of the cost of instruction, not to exceed $2,000 for any one town in one year. 
The intention of the act seems to be largely to introduce voca- 
tional classes into the regular elementary and secondary schools of the 
State, with a moderate provision for the establishment of true voca- 
tional schools when authorized by a vote of the town. 
In the new school code of the State of Pennsylvania there are certain 
provisions relating to industrial education. Article 4 authorizes 
the board of school directors to— 
establish, equip, furnish, and maintain the following additional schools or depart- 
ments for the education and recreation of persons residing in said district, which said 
additional schools or departments, when established, shall be an integral part of the 
public-school district and shall be so administered, namely: High schools, manual- 
training schools, vocational schools, domestic-science schools, agricultural schools, 
evening schools, kindergartens, libraries, museums, reading rooms, gymnasiums, 
playgrounds, schools for blind, deaf, and mentally deficient, truant schools, parental 
schools, schools for adults, public lectures, together with such other schools or educa- 
tional departments as they, in their wisdom, may see proper to establish. 3 
A further article authorizes the State superintendent of public 
instruction to “appoint one expert assistant in agricultural educa- 
tion, one expert assistant in industrial education, one expert assistant 
in drawing.”

Michigan passed an act during the year which empowers school 
districts to establish and- maintain trade, vocational, industrial, 
marine, and manual-training schools, gymnasiums, and scholarships, 
but makes no provisions for State support. 
Indiana has taken the important step of creating a commission 
for the investigation of industrial and agricultural education. This 
commission of seven was appointed in September by the governor, 
and has already effected an organization. It is to report to the legis- 
lature not later than January 1, 1913. The commission is to inves- 
tigate the needs of education in the different industries of Indiana 
and to see how far these needs: are met by existing institutions. It 
is to consider what new forms: of educational effort are advisable. 
It is to investigate also, by means of printed reports and the testi- 
mony of experts, what has been done in other States and in foreign 
countries in similar educational work. 
In New Jersey a law was passed, taking effect June 30, 1911, by 
which the State board of.education is reorganized and providing that 
a State commissioner of education be appointed by the governor for a 
term of five years. The.commissioner.has-power. under this law to 
appoint four assistant commissioners, one of whom is to devote his 
time to the inspection of industrial education, including agriculture. 
An industrial bill was introduced into the last session of the Cali- 
fornia Legislature providing that ‘special and technical training may 
be given in the mechanical arts, industrial trades, agricultural and 
horticultural pursuits, and. domestic science, in the grammar grades 
of the elementary schools .and.in. the secondary schools of this State.” 
This bill was vetoed by the governor.on.the ground that there was a 
question as to the available..funds.for inaugurating the system pro- 
posed, and, furthermore, that the plans.may. be beneficially matured 
before becoming a law. 
RECENTLY DEVELOPED TENDENCIES. 
There is no question but that the thought of all interested in the 
problem of industrial education is becoming measurably clearer as to 
ways and means best adapted to American-conditions. While the 
question of methods is very far from being settled, it is evident 
that the experience gained during the last five or six years is being 
evaluated and some important deductions drawn. It is being more 
and more appreciated, as actual results are studied, that economic 
quantities are the controlling elements in.the.situation and that only 
those measures are practical for wide application that take full 
account of these quantities. 
In attempting a brief summation of. the experience of the past few 
years and the tendencies .of the: present, .the-writer- would: offer: the | 
following: The institutions that. at present occupy an important
-P-A-G-E-329

place in industrial training in this country are the. intermediate 
industrial or preparatory trade schools; the trade school, the evening 
school, the part-time school, and the corporation or apprenticeship 
school. The economic factors involved in the conduct of these 
institutions are of two kinds: First, the expense of plant, operation, 
and cost of materials; and second, the matter of expense involved in 
attendance on the part of the student. Of these the second is prob- 
ably the more important in determining the practical possibilities of a 
school type. 
The first-mentioned school is a comparatively new type of institu- 
tion aiming to reach some of the large number of boys and girls that 
leave the elementary school at 14 years of age, and to supply a training 
that will give them a better equipment to enter industrial life at 16. 
Such schools take their students at an age when the question of wages 
is not so generally important as later on, and when many parents are 
willing to support their children at school for one or two years if con- 
vinced that practical benefits will follow. There are at present in 
Massachusetts and New York some 10 or 12 of these schools devoted 
to the woodworking, electrical, saab RBS printing, = machine 
trades. 
Taking into account the acess benefits afforded by snd schools 
and the possibilities of attendance by a considerable number of boys 
and girls well fitted to become industrial wage earners, and the not 
prohibitive cost for large communities, it is probable that such 
schools will become an important factor in industrial education in 
towns with-large manufacturing interests and over 50,000 population, 
and.that in time they will reach a considerable fraction of those boys 
and girls that now leave school at the end of the compulsory school 
period. From the character of training required and the close 
articulation with the elementary school, it is apparent that such 
schools are. best fitted for administration by public-school authorities. 
The trade school taking youths at 16 years of age or over, and 
furnishing a training to take the place in whole or in part of the 
apprenticeship system, is an institution which labors under the 
severest economic difficulties, whether considered from the side of 
maintenance or expense of attendance. Figures from schools now 
in operation indicate a grade of expense that obviously makes such 
institutions prohibitive for any except large cities, representing 
exceptional. specialization and concentration of industries; and even 
in such cities it is too early to prophesy that the results obtained will 
be permanently considered in proportion to the expense. 
Evening schools represent the first form of industrial education in 
this country, and they reach to-day by far the largest number of indi- 
viduals under.instructionin this field. As a means of supplementary 
instruction-in mathematics, science, drawing, and technical subjects,     
           
   
    
  
-P-A-G-E-330
  310 EDUCATION. REPORT, 1911. 
they present a simple and effective method of industrial education, at 
least for young men above, say, 18 years of age. Taking the young 
worker after the wage hours of a day are closed, such schools and 
classes represent the most easily available form of industrial educa- 
tion for the great mass of young workingmen and the simplest types 
from the standpoint of organization. Practical evening classes which 
afford an opportunity to broaden the shop experience of the day stand 
in the same relation to the worker, but they offer a more severe 
problem in expense of administration. 
Evening continuation schools were for half a century the backbone 
of the German system of industrial education. To-day that country 
is coming to a realization that for students between 14 and 18 the 
evening is not the best time for instruction, and she is bringing the 
work of her continuation schools into the day period. It will naturally 
require a considerable time for this country to reach the same point 
and to bring about a general agreement among manufacturers to 
allow learners in their establishments to attend industrial improve- 
ment schools during working hours. The positive benefits that result 
when such, a plan is followed, and the close correlation that is made 
between the work of the shop and. that of the classroom, have, how- 
ever, been so strikingly shown that this system of industrial education 
deserves to be increasingly studied by both employers and schoolmen. 
When the time for attendance upon the school work is granted to 
apprentices or other learners by employers and the wages continued 
during this period, the economic problem for the boy is solved, and 
inasmuch as the public school is not called upon to supply the costly 
equipment for practical work, but only that instruction specifically 
fitted to the technical needs of the learners, the administration 
expense is reduced to a minimum. 
In its beginnings such a plan is evidently most readily applied in 
cities and other localities where the concentration of high-grade indus- 
tries gives a large number of apprentices or learners in a compara- 
tively few lines. The application of such a system to low-grade indus- 
tries and to cities of varied manufacture is evidently much more diffi- 
cult both as an educational problem and as a matter of organization, 
but it does not seem unreasonable to expect that with increasing public 
support and cooperation of the employers a gradual and steady exten- 
sion of this plan of education will result. 
Another type of part-time or better cooperative school also demands 
serious attention, viz, the type in which, the initiative is taken from 
the school side and high-school students are given opportunities to 
spend half their time at work in industrial establishments and half 
at school. Such a system gives a larger amount of time to general 
education, but although very promising results have been obtained 
7
-P-A-G-E-331
  PROGRESS IN INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION IN 1910-11. Otel; 
from experiments in Fitchburg and Beverly, Mass., it still remains 
to be seen whether such schools will become an important factor in 
supplying a large number of workers to the industries. 
The apprenticeship or corporation school is a part-time school of the 
first type, in which both practical training and instruction is given 
within the commercial establishment. Where the industrial corpora- 
tion is of great size, it is probable that this method, which allows a 
maximum of coordination between both lines of instruction, will be 
increasingly adopted, but for a great majority of industrial establish- 
ments such a plan is hardly practicable, and division of labor between 
the employer on one hand and the public school on the other is the 
method that seems to make for the greatest efficiency and economy.

CHAPTER VIII. 
A SCHOOL FOR HOME MAKERS. 
By L. D. Harvey, 
President of Stout Institute, Menomonie, Wis. 
The Stout Training School for Teachers of Domestic Science and 
Art was established in Menomonie, Wis., in 1903. The demand for 
the graduates of that institution as teachers of domestic science and 
art in the public schools has shown an awakening of public interest 
to the importance of these subjects and to the necessity for definite 
instruction in them beyond what is afforded in the home. 
The time limit likely to be placed on these subjects in the public- 
school curriculum for some years to come, even under favorable con- 
ditions, will necessarily confine the instruction given to the elemen- 
tary phases, and valuable as it will prove, it will not fully meet 
the needs of those who wish to make thorough preparation for the 
responsibilities imposed by the care of the home. 
Experience in the administration of the training school disclosed 
the fact that there are many young women who do not wish to take 
the technical and professional training necessary to fit them for 
teaching, but who would be glad to avail themselves of the oppor- 
tunity for the acquisition of the practical knowledge and training - 
which a high-grade school for home makers should offer. 
A realization of this demand and a deep-seated conviction of the 
importance of this phase of educational effort, coupled with a recog- 
nition of its close relation to the lines of educational work already 
successfully inaugurated in Menomonie, led to the decision to open 
such a school in that city in September, 1907. The organization of 
the school was made possible through the public spirit of Hon. J. H. 
Stout, whose deep and practical interest in various phases of indus- 
trial education in elementary and secondary schools is well known. 
The character of the work done by the students who have com- 
pleted the course, their estimate of its value, and the favorable judg- 
ment expressed by scores of intelligent men and women from all 
parts of the country who have visited the school, studied its plan 
of organization, .and observed its work, all combine to approve the 
action of its founders in organizing the school. 
No attempt has been made to secure a large attendance, because 
much of the work has been in untried fields, and while it was being 
313  
-P-A-G-E-334
314 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
organized it was felt that better results could be secured by the indi- 
vidual student if the attendance were limited than with a larger 
number of students. This policy must be continued chiefly because 
of the rapid growth of the other departments of the institute and the 
consequent limited accommodations available for the home-makers’ 
school. It is hoped that in the near future new buildings may be 
provided, thus making it possible to remove the limit on attendance. 
BASIC CONSIDERATIONS. 
Economic, scientific, artistic, and ethical conditions are involved 
in the making of a home. Within the home the children are reared; 
its influence and the environment it creates are the potent factors in 
the development and shaping of the life of all members of the 
family and in determining their usefulness as members of society 
and as citizens of the State. The family is a business organization, 
the social unit, and an ethical force. The making of the home tests 
the efliciency of the family as a business organization, fixes its char- 
acter as a social unit, and determines its potency as an ethical force. 
The woman is an administrative officer of the family as a busi- 
ness organization; the man should provide the funds for carrying on 
the business of home-making ; the woman should disburse these funds 
in such a manner as to secure the desired results for the family and 
the home. The best results can not be secured in this organization 
unless both the man and the woman perform their respective func- 
tions with the highest degree of efficiency. The function of neither 
can be performed without adequate preparation. 
Society has provided, and is providing more and more completely, 
the means through which the man may secure proper preparation 
for the successful discharge of his function as provider for the 
family through his skill as a worker in the professional, commercial, 
‘or industrial field of activity. Professional schools, commercial 
schools, technical schools, and trade schools are being organized in 
increasing numbers to provide the training necessary for increasing 
the earning capacity of the man. 
Society has failed to recognize what an important factor the 
woman is in the family as a business organization; has not appre- 
ciated the variety and extent of the demands made upon her in the 
proper administration of household affairs, and therefore has failed 
to realize the importance of providing means for her training for 
efficiency in the home. The schools open to her, however compre- 
hensive in their courses for formal discipline and cultural values, 
have made little or no provision for a consideration of those sub- 
jects which are of vital importance to the woman who is some day 
to assume the responsibility of making a home for herself and her 
family.

If her mother possesses the necessary knowledge of economic, 
scientific, artistic, and ethical principles underlying the wise admin- 
istration of the affairs of the home, the necessary technical skill in 
applying these principles, ability as a teacher, inclination to teach 
her daughter, and time and strength for her teaching; and if her 
daughter, after the discharge of her school and social duties, has the 
strength, time, and inclination to profit by her mother’s instruction, © 
well and good. In very few homes in this country, however, do these 
conditions exist, and therefore few of the girls in these homes are 
getting the training so essential for the success and happiness of 
their lives and of the lives of others in the home. 
In most cases the girl goes from the school with such a stereo- 
typed academic training as opportunity and application have given 
her, but this training has touched but lightly, if at all, upon the 
vital affairs of her life; has fitted her but slightly to enter a new 
home and become an active partner in its business organization; to 
assume at once the cares, duties, and responsibilities of the home 
maker. From a life of limited responsibilities and cares she passes 
at once into another whose responsibilities fail to appall her, solely 
because of her ignorance of what is involved in the change. 
In attempting to set forth the work of this school it is deemed best 
not to give the details of the course of study, but rather general 
statements as to the scope of women’s activities in the home and the 
demand. made by these activities for instruction and training for 
their proper performance. 
In working out the details of the course of study as administered 
in the school the following plan has been pursued: The most im- 
portant activities demanded of a woman because of her position as 
a home maker were enumerated and classified so far as their inter- 
relation made such classification possible. An attempt was then 
made to answer the question, “What does a woman need to know 
and to do for the proper performance of each of these activities?” 
The answer to this question in each field of activity indicated the 
scope and character of the course of study for that field. This plan 
makes it possible to concentrate upon the essential things and to 
eliminate the nonessentials. It is probable that if time permitted 
the course of study in each particular field might be considerably 
elaborated with an addition of cultural value, although it is believed 
that there is high cultural value in every detail of the work regarded 
as necessary. In the main, effort has been concentrated on the 
essentials. The course in home and social economics is perhaps the 
only one in which there has been a development of work beyond the 
essentials into the field of what would be desirable because of its effect 
in broadening interests and giving a wider outlook on woman’s rela-

tion to the home and society and a larger appreciation of her oppor- 
tunities and responsibilities. 
SCOPE OF WORK OFFERED. 
In considering the duties of the home maker it will be seen that they 
are concerned with or group themselves about certain industries in the 
‘home and certain forms of activity. These activities may be classi- 
fied as those connected with the provision and maintenance of a_ 
suitable shelter for the family; those that concern themselves with the 
nutrition of the family; those that provide suitable clothing for the 
comfort of the family; those that have to do with the care of the 
dependent members of the family—children, invalids, and aged per- 
sons; and those that have to do with the social, industrial, and ethical 
relations of the members of the family to each other and to other 
members of society. 
The following general discussions will serve to show the relation 
between the various arts, sciences, and economic features that are 
included in a course of study that of necessity is so comprehensive. 
For convenience in arrangement the subjects are grouped under the 
following heads: The house, food study and cooking, clothing and 
household fabrics, care of children, home nursing and emergencies. 
home and social economics. The details of the course of instruction 
will have to be omitted for lack of space, but the general scope of the 
work as given will show that it is planned for the purpose of fitting 
young women to superintend their homes intelligently in all the rela- 
tions of these homes to the individuals within them and to the 
society of which they are a part. 
THE HOUSE. 
It is impossible to consider the house that shall shelter a family as 
a thing apart from the home that it represents. So intimate is the 
relation between the outward and visible manifestation and the in- 
ward and spiritual grace which seeks expression in the arrangement 
and fitting and management of a home that the real spirit of the 
family is usually shown in the material things of the house. Pos- 
sibly nothing exerts a greater influence upon the intellectual and 
moral development of a people than the character of the homes in 
which they live. When to this is added the physical effects produced 
by correct or incorrect housing, the desirability of having the organi- 
zation and management of the average home supervised by an indi- 
vidual who has initiative power and the ability to plan and direct its 
affairs becomes apparent. 
For convenience of consideration, this general.subject may be sub- 
divided into house sanitation, house decoration. and furnishing, and 
house management.
-P-A-G-E-337

HOUSE SANITATION. 
The study of house sanitation is dependent for its greatest value 
upon an understanding of the sciences of chemistry, physiology, 
physics, and bacteriology, and an appreciation of their application 
to such subjects as the heating, lighting, ventilation, and plumbing 
of the house. The sanitary requirements in the way of house loca- 
tion, in obtaining pure water supply, and in maintaining absolute 
cleanliness of surroundings, as well as the furnishings and materials 
in the house, have their source in scientific principles that should be 
applied in the locating or selecting, planning, and care of the house. 
A definite study of the application of these principles to actual condi- 
tions as they exist will go a long way toward improving the health 
conditions of the country. 
      
               
                    
   
              HOUSE DECORATION AND FURNISHING. 
Flouse decoration and furnishing is a subject that has only re- 
cently claimed the attention of the average individual. The ability 
to create a harmonious environment has been considered a special 
gift to the few. The majority, through lack of training, have had 
to content themselves with existing conditions that have often vio- 
lated -every principle of good furnishing and artistic decoration. 
To-day it is realized that the woman who is to plan and furnish 
a house-needs some instruction that will be of use to her in creating 
a home where beauty and harmony and perfection of form shall 
produce an environment conducive to right living. That this may 
be accomplished a course is offered in design, color, house planning, 
decoration and-furnishing, and the opportunity provided for prac- 
tical application in all lines of art relating directly to home making. 
HOUSE MANAGEMENT. 
The organization of a course of study in house management is 
practically impossible unless there be opportunity for direct appli- 
cation of the principles taught. This application may be obtained 
under existing conditions in the cottages where the young women 
live during the school year. That the full benefit of experience 
may result, there is a definite course of instruction in each of the 
phases of home management and such actual performance of duties 
las may be necessary to a thorough understanding of the principles 
involved.” These duties are so varied that they include most lines 
f activity found in a home, but in the correct organization of such 
raried duties each assumes its proper proportions, and the result is 
well-regulated system for the performance of the business of the 
ousehold.  
-P-A-G-E-338
  318 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
BUSINESS MANAGEMENT IN THE HOME. 
The value of a broad training that will fit women to discharge 
the business of their households, that will assure them adequate 
results for money expended, and give them a better appreciation 
and estimation of values can not. be too strongly urged. The 
proper apportioning of the income among the different lines of 
home expenditures, the systematizing and keeping of household ac- 
counts, the selection of materials for the home, the organization and 
division of labor, the question of domestic service, are all topics 
considered in their economic relations in the theoretical discussions 
of the subjects and in their practical application in the supervision 
and care of the home makers’ cottages which is a part of the regular 
second-year course. 
FOOD STUDY AND PREPARATION. 
The problem of providing suitable food for a family, when solved, 
means approximately perfect nutrition. This should result in nor- 
mal and vigorous physical development, giving a sane and healthy 
outlook upon life and an opportunity for the development of the 
higher powers of the intellectual and moral life. 
This selection of nutritives is the problem that confronts every | 
woman who has others dependent upon her for daily food, and, of 
all- the problems connected with the management of a home, is 
probably the most persistent, the most difficult of solution, and the 
most disastrous in its results if incorrectly solved, or as is often the 
case, its solution is not undertaken at all. There may be a vast dif- 
ference between satisfying the hunger of the members of a family 
and supplying them with the right kinds of food to satisfy the 
various needs of their bodies. That the greatest influence of per- 
fect or imperfect nutrition is operative at a period of life when the 
young person is dependent upon others for care is an added reason 
that those having homes in charge should understand the science of 
nutrition, its practical application, and the influence that it exerts 
upon the welfare of the members of the family. 
The practical situation that presents itself is, how to provide the 
best possible food for the family with the means at hand. In other 
words, how shall she secure for the family the foods best suited to the 
various activities of each individual that will be palatable, attrac- 
tive in appearance, and in cost in accordance with the amount that 
should be expended by that family for food? A theoretical treat- 
ment of the subject which does not result in an answer to this prac- 
tical question does not give to the inquirer the assistance that she 
needs and does not result in any particular elevation of the general 
standards of nutrition. If, however, enough application can be com- 
 
-P-A-G-E-339
  SCHOOL FOR HOME MAKERS. 319 
bined with a thorough understanding of the scientific principles 
underlying correct nutrition to give an idea of the practical value of 
a course in food study, the usableness of the knowledge becomes 
apparent and a better general use of foodstuffs should be the result. 
The subject matter will naturally fall under two main divisions: 
1. The sciences, or fundamental principles. 
2. The arts, or practical application. 
The sciences to be considered are chemistry, biology, physiology, 
and dietetics.     
     
                
    
            
      
   
   CHEMISTRY. 
The course in chemistry includes a study of the simple elements 
of general chemistry necessary to a comprehension of the relation 
of this science to the care of the home and its occupants. This 
relation is shdwn in a study of food composition, food combinations, 
chemical processes in the preparation and digestion of foods, food 
adulterations, the determination of food values, and the chemical 
processes involved in the cleaning operations in the home—soap mak- 
ing, removal of stains, cleaning of metals, woods and wood finishes, 
general laundering processes—in relation to fabrics, in the study of 
dyes and their influence upon quality and durability. 
BIOLOGY. 
A study of the influence of plant and animal life on food material, 
of the production and storage of food material on plant and animal, 
tissue, and of bacteriology in its relation to food preservation and to 
the preservation of health. Household bacteriology invites a study of 
physical and chemical changes induced in food products by the growth 
of molds, yeasts, and bacteria, a study of the conditions necessary for 
this growth, and a consideration of these organisms from the stand- 
point of house sanitation. It also includes a study of bacteria in their 
relation to disease—sources of infection, types of infection, the prin- 
cipal infectious diseases, personal and household disinfection. 
PHYSIOLOGY. 
A. study of the uses of food materials in the body—digestion, as- 
similation, storage of energy, excretion of waste materials; a study 
lof the influence of hygienic living upon physical well-being—correct 
food, exercise, rest, sleep, regularity of habit, cleanliness, correct 
lothing, and proper general habits of life; an application of the 
rinciples of physiology and hygiene to the physical improvement 
£ individuals in the home and to health conditions of the home itself.  
-P-A-G-E-340
  320 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
DIETETICS, 
    
   
    
   
     
                                  
          A study dependent upon a knowledge of chemistry, biology, and 
physiology, in which is considered the suiting of food substances 
to the particular requirements of the body in health and disease, the 
influence of age, climate, and occupation upon the kind and amount 
of food used and upon its manner of preparation. 
The practical application of this course is made in the planning 
of dietaries suited to different conditions, the working out of the 
balance of food materials found in each, the actual weighing, pre- 
paring, and serving of the dietaries to test their practical character 
and to verify the amounts used. 
SELECTION OF FOOD MATERIALS, 
The selection of food materials involves a decision as fo the amount 
of money to be expended upon food, a study of the markets and 
available foodstuffs, a knowledge of manufacture and methods of 
production in their influence upon the character of foods, a knowl- 
edge of the food value of various foods, and the ability to substitute 
less expensive materials, having the same food value, for the more 
expensive ones. A definite course in marketing, combining the selec- 
tion of materials with the keeping of household accounts, will con- 
stitute a part of the course of the senior year. This will be conducted 
in connection with the supervision of the cottages and the planning 
and ordering of the meals, and will continue for such time as is 
necessary to gain some proficiency in this particular line of work. 
CARE OF FOOD MATERIALS AND FOODS, 
The correct care of food materials before preparation, and of foods 
after preparation, means an enormous saving in expenditure for food 
materials and a saving in actual food value in the materials them- 
selves. This involves a knowledge of the action of yeasts, molds, 
ferments, and other forms of bacteria, and the ability to apply the 
scientific principles underlying practical food preservation. 
PREPARATION OF FOOD. 
The actual preparation of food, if it is to be of highest value, must 
be considered with reference to its effect upon the food value of the 
materials used and with reference to the particular use to which 
they are to be put. This naturally requires a consideration of suitable 
food combinations and the actual preparation of foods. This prepa- 
ration includes the application of the principles of cookery to the 
foodstuffs that are in common use in the average American home. 
Special emphasis is placed upon the preparation of palatable and
-P-A-G-E-341
  
SCHOOL FOR HOME MAKERS, 321 
attractive foods from the less expensive materials. The combination 
of these foods into meals gives experience in actual practical prepara- 
tion and is continued until a sufficient degree of efficiency has been 
acquired. A course in invalid cookery, supplementary to the study 
of home nursing, is included in the advanced work in cookery. 
SERVING. 
Serving is supplementary to cookery and in addition to the regular 
serving of simple meals includes the serving of luncheons, dinners, 
and meals of ceremony and entertainment, the decoration of tables, 
duties of host, hostess, and waiter, and the entertainment of guests. 
Opportunity to gain skill in serving is given in connection with the 
discharge of regular duties in the care of the cottages. All such 
work is conducted as regular class exercises and under the direct 
supervision of the director of the department. 
CLOTHING AND HOUSEHOLD FABRICS. 
CLOTHING. 
The problem of selecting fabrics and combining them into gar- 
ments and articles for the use of the household is one that requires 
training in the knowledge of materials, their wearing qualities, their 
real, not their apparent values, their care, and their combination as 
to color and quality. Skill must be developed in the use of materials 
and in making or directing the making of common household articles 
and clothing for the family. 
In considering the clothing for the use of the family such attention 
must be given to hygiene as will result in the selection of materials 
and shape of garments that will aid instead of impeding physical de- 
velopment; attention must be given to color and form, harmony and 
appropriateness, that the clothing may be suited to the physical 
peculiarities of the individual for whom it is planned, adapted to the 
peculiar uses of the individual, and attractive because of its appro- 
priateness for use by the individual. The comparative cost and qual- 
ity of fabrics must also be studied, that the expenditure for clothing 
may be in proportion to the expenditure for other necessities, and that 
correct standards for this particular phase of expenditure may be es- 
tablished. The repair of clothing is also a problem that needs careful 
attention, for, unless proper care is taken of the wearing apparel, 
much money is uselessly expended and little satisfaction and comfort 
result from it. The care of clothing when not in use affects materi- 
ally its durability, correct storing being absolutely necessary to 
secure the full wearing value. The actual cutting, fitting, and mak- 
ing of clothing demands a skill and judgment that come only with 
experience and practice.

-P-A-G-E-342
  322 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
FABRICS USED FOR DECORATIONS AND FURNISHINGS. 
The selection, construction, and care of other fabrics used in the 
household demand attention along the the same lines as the selection 
of clothing, with an additional emphasis upon the possibilities of 
applying a knowledge of design and color to the construction and 
decoration of draperies and other articles of furnishing. 
The course to be effective must include a study of textiles, design, 
and color; practical application in the selection of materials; the 
fundamental principles of sewing, mending, and repairing; the mak- 
ing of plain garments, children’s clothes, etc.; the designing and 
making of dresses and hats; the making and marking of household 
linens; the uses of embroideries and fancy needlework; and the appli- 
cation of needlework to various forms of household decoration. 
THE CARE OF CHILDREN. 
A thoughtful observer must realize that every child who does not 
receive good care during the formative period of his life is seriously 
handicapped physically as well as mentally and morally in after 
years. That this handicap results from the ignorance or indiffer- 
ence of those upon whom he is dependent does not make the struggle 
that he must undergo any less nor the difficulties any easier to sur- 
mount. His competition with others of his kind is keen; and if he 
is not equipped for it, he must suffer from it as surely as though 
through some fault of his own. That the child has a right to the 
care that will prepare him for his life work, whatever it may be, 
everyone will admit. The difficulty is to assure this care to the 
average child in the average home: The one solution of this diffi- 
culty would seem to be a definite and systematic course of instruction 
for young women that will aid them in fitting themselves to dis- 
charge the duties that devolve upon those responsible for the care 
of children. F 
This course includes a study of child nutrition; of the hygiene of 
childhood, including bathing, clothing, amount of sleep, exercise, 
amount of pure air, regularity of habit, absolute cleanliness of the 
individual and the environment; the consideration of infant dis- 
eases and emergencies; and the selection, making, and care of cloth- 
ing. It also includes a definite and distinctive study of child psy- 
chology in order that there may be an understanding of the stages 
and the mental development of the child; of the value of the crea- 
tion of correct ideals; of the force of will power well directed; and 
of the value of the formation of correct mental and moral habits, 
no less than an understanding of the physical necessities of childhood. 
The varying and developing ethical code of the family is noted 
from the time of the primitive family to the present, the training of 
 
-P-A-G-E-343
  
SCHOOL FOR HOME MAKERS. 323 
the primitive child for self-protection only and of the modern child 
for virtue as well. The subject of virtue is considered in so far as it 
requires a certain choice between two lines of conduct and the exer- 
cise of the will to carry out the end chosen. 
The child’s instincts and interests are determined, the child’s 
imagination with its relation to truth telling and deceit, the forma- 
tion of right habits, the development of a child’s will power, the 
question of obedience and of punishment, the child’s play and its 
relation to its mental, moral, and physical development are each 
considered. 
In connection with the ney of children’s literature the following 
topics are studied: 
1. The different classes of children’s books. 
2. The interests and values of each class. 
3. The art of story telling. 
4. A brief sketch of the history of children’s books. 
5. The art of leading the child from a certain interest in reading 
to a related line of reading. 
6. The tests of a wholesome and healthful book for children of 
varying ages. 
        
    
   
         
    
        
    
          
    HOME NURSING AND EMERGENCIES. 
No home training is complete without attention to the care of 
invalids and dependent members of the family in the home. This 
involves a knowledge of simple maladies that may be treated at home 
and of the use of simple household remedies, the care of the sick 
room, care of the bed, care of the patient, giving of baths, the use 
of antiseptics, disinfectants, and deodorants. For emergencies the 
instruction will include the usual requirements in caring for cuts, 
burns, swoons, poisoning, and accidents of various kinds. 
HOME AND SOCIAL ECONOMICS. 
The course in home and social economics has been developed with 
the idea that woman sustains ethical, social, and industrial relations 
with the other members of the family and with the members of soci- 
ety outside her home. These relations exist because the home and 
society exist as distinct organisms with definite functions, and be- 
cause woman is necessarily a part of each of these organisms. These 
relations entail responsibilities. That woman shall effectively dis- 
charge these responsibilities is of the highest importance to her, to 
the home, and to society. 
The first condition of wise and effective action in this field is a 
knowledge of existing conditions, wherein they need modification, 
nd how such modification may be effected. The acquisition of that 
nowledge involves a course of study of social needs and possibilities; 
 
-P-A-G-E-344

   of customs in the family and in society; of industrial organization, 
and. of the relation of the family to this industrial organization; of 
ethics or the moral obligations of the members of the family to each 
other and to society, and especially of the moral obligation of the 
mother to her children and to the community in which she lives. 
The work in this course begins with a discussion of the meaning of 
the term, “home and social economics ; the importance of the study 
of the same; the former low popular estimate of the importance of the 
art and science of homemaking; and the causes and evidences of the 
changing estimate of to-day. 
A discussion of the evolution of the house and home then follows, 
of the evolution of home concepts from that of the home as a tempo- 
rary abode for the purpose of shelter from the elements or of protec- 
tion from wild animals, to the idea of home embodying the concepts of 
comfort, privacy, sanctity; as a place for the development of house- 
hold instincts; of mutual service to those related by the ties of blood, 
as a place best fitted to minister to the physica! needs and the moral 
welfare of child life. 
This is followed with a detailed study of the family. This topic 
includes a consideration of the evolution of the famity or family 
community; of woman’s social and industrial status, and hence her 
duties in the family at various stages of the development of the 
human race; of the early purposes of marriage; of the evolution of 
other and nobler concepts which dignified the marriage bond; of the 
reciprocal duties of the members of the same family; of the effect of 
family life upon the characters of man and woman; of the family as 
a necessary basis of social order; of the old-time ties and the modern 
ties which bind members of the same family together; of modern in- 
dustrial conditions which affect family life; of the modern problems 
of family life. 
The study of the welfare of the child in the family includes the 
problem of the child’s heredity, of his environment and his ethical 
training. 
The question of heredity involves a consideration of the birth rate 
of defective children, and of statistics concerning delinquent chil- 
dren; of infant and child mortality ; of the racial poisons, of inherita- 
ble diseases; of the inheritance of criminal tendencies; and, in conse- 
quence of the above, of the importance of the woman’s rejection of 
an unfit mate or the acceptance of a fit mate who will be a fit father 
for prospective children. 
The matter of environment involves the following: What consti- 
tutes a right home environment; illustrations of wrong conditions o 
home environment; the mother’s ignorance of, indifference to, or help: 
lessness to obviate these conditions. The school life of the child, hi 
reading, his associates, his amusements and the presence or absence o
-P-A-G-E-345
  
SCHOOL FOR HOME MAKERS. 325 
civic cleanliness, of civic beauty, of civic morality make up to a great 
extent the environment of the child aside from his home and family 
life. 
Consequently, consideration follows of actual relations which exist 
between the home and the school, of possible ideal relations, a study 
of places where better relations have been attempted and established. 
Woman’s industrial relations to the community outside of the home 
indicated the selection of the following: Man’s and woman’s place 
in industry in primitive life; the evolution and division of labor on 
sex lines; the passing of certain lines of what was formerly considered 
woman’s work into the hands of men; the specialization and organiza- 
tion of former home industries outside the home; the modern entrance 
of woman into the industrial world outside the home; the effects of 
the entrance of woman into modern industrial life upon. her charac- 
ter, the quality of her work, her relations in her home, and upon child 
life. 
Again, the entrance of woman into modern industrial life has 
affected the standard of wages and man’s choice of occupations, has 
to a certain extent begun to humanize certain industrial conditions, 
has affected the social relations of man and woman, has stimulated 
the public conscience with respect to present lamentable conditions of 
child life, has originated expedients and plans for ameliorating wrong 
conditions, and has stimulated the study of industrial and social 
problems. 
‘Woman’s industrial relations in the home determined the following 
choice of topics: 
(1) Household industries. 
(a) Order of appearance. 
(6) Arrested development and suppressed specialization. 
(c) Consequent effect upon the character of woman. 
(2) Number of arts and crafts involved in the management of the 
primitive household compared with the number of arts, crafts, and 
sciences involved to-day. 
(8) Limitations of a woman’s knowledge of the arts, crafts, and 
sciences in the management of a properly conducted home to-day. 
‘Woman’s industrial relations in her home must also be considered 
from an ethical standpoint in so far as her failure or success in carry- 
ing out the varied lines of her household duties affects the health, the 
happiness, the comfort, and, hence, the character of the various mem- 
bers of her family. This means the selection for study and practice 
of certain sciences and arts for the wife and mother to properly ad- 
minister to the health, happiness, and comfort of the different mem- 
bers of her family. 
The “servant problem,” as it affects the household’s health and com- 
fort to so appreciable extent, is studied under the following heads:  
-P-A-G-E-346
  326 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
(1) What is the “servant problem”? (2) Reasons for prevailing 
conditions of household service from the standpoint of both “ mis- 
tress” and “maid.” (3) Attempts to better these conditions, and 
failure of these attempts. (4) Suggested solutions of the problem. 
As the family is the largest consumer of industrial products, and 
as the wife and mother is the purchaser for the family, the family is 
involved in certain industrial and ethical relations with society. With 
this thought in view the following subjects are considered: (1) The 
growing needs and desires of the family and their effect upon the 
spirit of avarice on the part of the producer, the manufacturer, and 
the merchant. (2) The consequent effect upon the quality and quan- 
tity of products and the relations between employers and employees. 
(8) The unconscious false teaching in the family because of the 
family’s attempt to compete with families of greater means. (4) 
The setting up of false standards of worth and of social success. 
Woman’s chief economic function to-day is the spending of money. 
Woman’s relation to the community as chief purchaser of the world’s 
products is of great and vital importance to her family and to society, 
because she establishes standards of life for the larger part of society, 
and determines to a large extent the quality of commodities produced 
in the industrial world. This topic is discussed with the class in the 
following order: 
(1) Rights of the purchaser— 
(a) To buy articles that are as represented. 
(6) To buy articles uncontaminated by filth and disease 
germs. : 
(ce) To buy articles which are not produced under unhappy 
conditions capable of amelioration. 
(2) Rights of the producer— 
(a) To produce articles under the best conditions possible. 
(6) To produce articles of a high standard of excellence. 
(3) Some typical purchasers— 
(a) Ignorant of conditions of production. 
(6) Indifferent to conditions of production. 
(ce) Unable to find out true condition of production. 
(d) Lacking any intelligent study of the art of buying. 
(4) Principles to guide the purchaser— 
(a) Relations of the cost of living to the various lines of 
outlay. 
(6) Relation of amount of expenditure to the size of the

SCHOOL FOR HOME MAKERS. 827 
Woman’s social relations with the members of her family deter- 
mine the following topics: (1) The different types of the mother and 
wife; for example, the family drudge and servant, the home organ- 
izer and the disciplinarian, the so-called society woman, and the 
sympathetic friend and companion, or the combination of two or 
more of these types in one. (2) The qualities and training necessary 
to fulfill the duties of each of the above types. 
Woman’s ethical and social relations to society at large are receiv- 
ing a large share of the modern woman’s attention. The growing 
wealth of different communities, the application of modern inven- 
tions to home industries, the passing of many of the former lines of 
women’s work into the factory, have brought to many women leisure 
which should be spent in social service. Hence, an attempt has been 
made to select problems in civic life which seem to be a part of the 
duties of women. Civic cleanliness, the humane treatment of chil- 
dren, the “city beautiful” movement, civic morality, which means 
the protection of children from immoral influences, the modern slum 
and tenement, child labor, the organizations to protect neglected 
children and to reform juvenile delinquents—all these questions are 
legitimately within the province of motherhood, and the serious 
study of one or more of them and the attempt to improve conditions 
are among the duties of the modern woman. 
This course then aims to make a serious study of women’s clubs and 
organizations—their history and aims, their development of new 
and nobler purposes and lines of work, their successes and mistakes. 
From the many social problems of interest different topics have 
been selected for special research and study with different classes; 
for example, the work of the consumers’ league in their attempt to 
teach the art and ethics of buying; the work of the State and of 
local communities, of public and private philanthropy to better the 
conditions of child life in slums and tenements; a perspective or 
brief survey of the attempts made to improve social conditions which 
need study and improvement. 
IMPORTANCE OF THIS COURSE. 
As the study of the course outlined in home and social economics 
consumes an appreciable part of the time devoted to the work of the 
school curriculum, the question arises whether this branch of study 
has results commensurate with the amount of time and energy and 
thought expended, in comparison with other branches of the school 
curriculum. 
Homemaking, the bearing, rearing, and training of children will 
be a large share of the life work of the majority of women. Hence 
a question that confronts the woman in the home and requires the 
most serious consideration is how to correctly care for and rear the  
-P-A-G-E-348
  328 EDUGATION REPORT, 1911. 
children in that home. In answering this question she is not respon- 
sible to herself alone nor to her immediate family, but to society at 
large—to the entire social structure. The primary purpose of a home, 
with all that it stands for in the way of opportunity for development 
of moral fineness of fiber, is to definitely provide surroundings and 
conditions conducive to the greatest possible mental and moral 
growth of the inmates of the home, particularly of the children. 
Anything that interferes with this growth interferes with the true 
function of the home. Anything that furthers it is a benefit, not to 
the family alone, but to all mankind. 
Owing to the organization of society, the creation and mainte- 
nance of this environment and the care of the individuals developing 
in it fall largely upon the woman in the home. Considering the 
seriousness of this undertaking and the fact that the responsibility 
of caring for children in their early life usually comes to women 
young in years and experience, it would seem that some preparation 
other than the mere intuition of motherhood should be secured to aid 
in the discharge of this great and vital responsibility. 
‘When we consider that one-tenth of the children born alive are 
defective and that of the remaining 90 per cent, one-third die before 
the age of 5 years, the justice of the child’s right to be well born— 
that is, physically fit—can not be denied. When we consider the 
number of delinquent children, the right of the child to be well 
born—that is, free from criminal tendencies, and to be reared in a fit 
environment—can not be questioned. The girl must be made to 
realize that she can not enter lightly upon the duties attendant upon 
marriage and family life with no conception of her responsibilities 
in the matter of determining a mate to be the fit father of her chil- 
dren; with little motive for marriage but the desire to be protected, or 
to escape the necessity of earning her own livelihood; with no con- 
ception of the gravity of her step in its effect for good or evil upon 
the next generation; with no preparation whatever for her new life 
beyond the so-called instinct of motherhood. Hence, the course in 
home and social economics includes the study of the topics called 
heredity, environment, and the moral training of children. 
The study of the family, its enlarging pantie and purposes, its 
importance as a social unit making for social order, its effect for good 
or evil on the standards and ideals of the community, its effect on the 
development of certain virtues and emotions induced by the relations 
of the members of the family to each other, the conditions affecting 
the stability and purity of modern family life, the duties of the 
father, the mother, and the child in the family will insure the 
woman’s keener realization of the supreme place of the social unit, 
the family, in the life of a child and of a people.
-P-A-G-E-349
    SCHOOL FOR HOME MAKERS. 329 
The girl’s conception of what a home means and of what a home 
should be must not be vague, undefined, or narrow. A comparison 
of the meaning of the word “home” to the primitive man, with the 
varied and noble concepts which were born with the advance of 
civilization and the evolution of ethical ideas may give the home- 
maker a truer and deeper meaning of the term homemaking, a 
broader idea of her duties, a keener realization of their importance. 
A consideration of the causes of the former low popular estimate 
of household duties and industries, and an understanding of the 
causes and evidences of a changing estimate to-day, will enforce the 
growing dignity of woman’s household work. 
Woman has little recognized the influence of her responsibilities as 
a purchasing agent, not only upon the health, the comfort, the happi- 
ness, the standards of her own family, but also upon the standards 
of the community of which she is a member. To many a woman it 
would be a revelation to realize that in her capacity as a purchasing 
agent she determines the quantity and quality of the world’s com- 
modities; that what she purchases and from where she purchases 
determine the very conditions of production, as illustrated in the 
manufacture of sweatshop goods, of adulterated textiles and foods, 
for example. Hence the attempt to make the girl realize that the 
wise expenditure of the family income is not only an art to be studied, 
but a vital question in the field of ethics as well. 
Woman has far more privileges and opportunities to-day than 
ever in the past. She is no longer, in civilized communities, treated 
as a chattel, or a dependent, or a toy, or a drudge with few rights or 
privileges, with little freedom of choice or the liberty of determining 
a line of action. Her social freedom, her added privileges, her oppor- 
tunities to be educated, her greater amount of leisure, due to the 
diminution of the number of the household crafts, have all brought 
with them new opportunities and new responsibilities in her ethical 
and industrial relations to society. The new and increasing prob- 
Iems of social and industrial life need the woman’s point of view as 
well as the man’s, her serious study and earnest work. 
Therefore, topics dealing with modern social problems have been 
selected to influence the girls of to-day to be women with trained 
intelligence, earnest purpose, and active conscience, that they may 
serve to better effect not only their families, but the community in 
which they live. However, in planning this course of study the 
aim has been to keep in mind the fact that woman’s privileges, 
woman’s training, woman’s rights are limited to-day and always 
will be by the rights of the hes child and of the child who is 
now in our midst.

CONTINUED INTEREST IN AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION. 
Agricultural education and agriculture as a means of education 
continue to be predominating topics of discussion at educational con- 
ferences and in professional journals. Special legislation relating to 
elementary or secondary instruction in agriculture was proposed or 
enacted in the general assemblies of 30 of the 40 States whose legis- 
latures have met in session during the past year. State committees 
to investigate the needs of agricultural and industrial education are 
at work or have recently completed their work in 7 States—Illinois, 
Indiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, South Carolina, and 
Wisconsin. 
An organization, the-American Association for the Advancement 
of Agricultural Teaching, was formed in Chicago during the past 
year, largely of representatives of the departments of agricultural 
education of the State colleges of agriculture of the Middle West. 
This organization proposes to hold annual meetings and also through- 
out the year to collect and distribute to its members information 
concerning the developments in agricultural education in schools and 
colleges. The yearbook of the National Society for the Study of Edu- 
cation for 1911 is devoted entirely to a discussion of agriculture in 
331

secondary schools, with chapters by W. R. Hart, of the Massachusetts 
Agricultural College; G. P. Warren, of the New York State College 
of Agriculture; F. R. Crane, principal of the Dunn County School 
of Agriculture, at Menominee, Wis.; W. H. French, Michigan Agri- 
cultural College; R. W. Stimson, agricultural agent of the Massa- 
chusetts State Board of Education; D. J. Crosby, of the United 
States Department of Agriculture; and A. C. Monahan, of the 
Bureau of Education. The special agricultural school, the agricul- 
tural department of the high school, the extension eee of the agri- 
cultural high school, and the preparation of teachers of agriculture 
for secondary schools are all taken up. 
WAKE COUNTY (N. C.) SCHOOL FARM MOVEMENT. 
A unique plan for agricultural education has developed in Wake 
County, N. C., under the leadership of Z. V. Judd, the county super- 
intendent of public instruction. The plan has been called the “School 
farm movement ” and comprehends the establishment of small farms 
of from 2 to 10 acres in connection with every country school. This 
farm is to be cultivated by the children and their parents, working 
together on certain days in what Mr. Judd has termed “ school farm 
working bees.” The working bees are gatherings for social purposes, 
as well as for the cultivation of the school land. Each school farm 
is usually given to one crop. A regular system of rotation is planned. 
The agricultural work is done under the supervision of the best 
farmer in the community, so that. good methods are used. Every 
person, therefore, taking part is given the opportunity to observe 
the most successful systems of raising the crops under cultivation. 
The income received from the sale of the products raised on the school 
farm is used for general school purposes. It is hoped by this move- 
ment to accomplish three things: First, to make money to be used in 
supplementing the school fund; second, to offer an opportunity to 
make the teaching of agriculture in the rural school entirely practical 
and to illustrate how pleasant farm work can be made under proper 
conditions; and, third, to offer rural communities opportunities for 
gatherings to develop the social side of farm life, with the school- 
house the social center of the community and the principal occupa- 
tion of the people—farming—the center of interest. 
The first work was done at Holly Springs, where two years ago 
2 acres of land were planted in cotton. The lighter work was done| 
by the women and children of the community, while the men did| 
the heavy work. A community dinner was a part of the progra 
for each gathering. Two bales of cotton were raised, netting th 
school $119. The next year the plan was tried at 11 schools, th 
crops raised including cotton, corn, tobacco, and wheat. On the 1 
farms 1,200 persons participated in the work. The net profit wa:
-P-A-G-E-353
  
  AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION. 333 
nearly $1,200. Last year 6 additional farms were established, 
making a total of 17 farms. 
The children of the county want these school farms, and the older 
people are in sympathy with the idea. The results have been an 
increased interest in the schools and the school work, an improve- 
inent in the appearance of the buildings and grounds, and the length- 
ening of the school year; also the development of a better community 
spirit and an improvement in general farming in the county. 
COMMISSIONS ON AGRICULTURAL AND INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION. 
The prevailing interest in agricultural education is well shown 
by the creation of commissions in several States by legislative 
enactment to investigate the needs of agricultural and industrial 
education. The recommendations of several such commissions con- 
cerning instruction in agriculture are given in the following para- 
graphs. Considerable space is devoted to the report of the Massa- 
chusetts committee on account of the thoroughness of the survey 
relative to agricultural education that was made in large sections of 
the State, and to the plan proposed of connecting the instruction in 
. the agricultural department of the school with the student’s home 
work on the farm, under the supervision of the school instructor. 
ILLINOIS, 
An educational committee in Illinois, reporting to the legislature 
of. 1911, devoted a large part of its report to the recommendations 
of a subcommittee on industrial education. The subcommittee 
recommended that the high-school curriculum should distinctly 
recognize the vocational -needs of the student, allowing him to devote 
at least one-fourth of his time to work of that character. Six voca- 
tional courses should be offered, including “a course leading to the 
profession of farming, with special reference to the domesticated 
animals and plants, and to the soil as a sustainer of life, supported 
by the physical sciences and by the principles of accounting.” Also: 
The nature-study work of the grades should lead up naturally to the high 
school, and to this end should be so conducted as to follow the evolution of the 
child and develop gradually from the undifferentiated study of the natural 
environment in the lower grades to a differentiation in the upper so clear as 
to establish in the mind of the pupil in the grammar grade a conception of the 
field of the various natural sciences and a well-developed vocational concious- 
ness. * * * By this means the child is prepared for an intelligent choice 
of his vocational course. * * * Schools should be advised to ascertain 
whether and to what extent pupils are engaged in duties outside of school, and 
when it shall appear that such duties are definite and regular, then their value 
should be assessed and proper credit given the student on the progress of his 
course, particularly for work done in direct line with the vocational courses 
of the high school, 
 
-P-A-G-E-354
    
834 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
A course of study in agriculture for a well-equipped 4-year high 
school is suggested. 
MASSACHUSETTS. 
The special committee of the Massachusetts Board of Education, 
appointed to investigate the needs of agricultural education in Massa- 
chusetts, consisted of the State commissioner of education, Dr. David 
Snedden; Deputy Commissioner C. A. Prosser, and Special Agent 
R. W. Stimson. The findings, in brief, of the committee follow: 
1. Farming in Massachusetts is a highly important vocation. 
2. Massachusetts farming, where most profitably practiced, is peculiarly de- 
pendent upon and responsive to scientific knowledge and improved methods. Its 
increasing diversity and specialization, which are such promising elements in 
its progress, make more difficult the task of preparation for it, and make more 
emphatic the duty of the State to the boys and girls who are to follow it. 
8. Agencies for carrying scientific knowledge and improved methods to adults 
and to students of such age and preliminary training as to enable them to meet 
the usual college entrance requirements appear to have been both carefully 
considered and fairly well established. 
4. There is a decided lack of and a pronounced demand for agricultural 
training of a scientific and very practical character, suitable for boys, and 
perhaps for some girls, 14 years of age and older, who expect to gain their 
livelihood from and to spend their lives on Massachusetts farms. 
5. The growing commercial and industrial school facilities open to boys and 
girls 14 years of age and older tend to lure away from the land and into the 
congested centers, in the absence of competent and attractive agricultural 
education, many young people whose natural aptitudes would make them, if. 
properly trained, better and more prosperous citizens in the country. 
6. Financial aid for agricultural education, suitable for adults and for col- 
lege students, has for a half century been furnished by this Commonwealth 
and by the Federal Government. State aid for vocational training of secondary 
grade in agriculture is, moreover, entirely in keeping with State aid for inde- 
pendent industrial school work, and to some extent was provided for by chapter 
505 of the acts of 1906 and chapter 572 of the acts of 1908. 
7. The slow development of secondary agricultural schools, the testimony of 
farmers throughout the State, and the demand for the investigation here 
reported which was. made by the legislature of 1910, are evidence of the need 
of additional legislation providing for this kind of agricultural education. 
8. School committees have long been authorized and empowered to provide 
instruction in agriculture in the public elementary and high schools of the 
State. While this training has been more liberal and cultural than vocational 
in its aims and results, it merits the hearty support of local communities in 
this Commonwealth. 
Instruction in gardening and in other matters relating to the farm should 
be encouraged and guided in all the elementary schools of the State where 
the home environment or the school facilities make productive work and per- 
sonal observation by the pupils practicable. 
As an important aid to liberal education in all of the high schools of the 
State, particularly in those which have a rural environment, guidance and 
encouragement should be given with a view to the incorporation of generous 
proportions of agricultural subject matter in science instruction, and to the 
sympathetic correlation of certain parts of the instruction in English, history, 
civics, and hygiene with rural life and labor, institutions, and progress.
-P-A-G-E-355
AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION. 335 
9. In order that more adequate school facilities may be provided in this 
Commonwealth for preparing those above 14 years of age for productive and 
profitable farming, vocational agricultural departments are proposed in this 
report for establishment in existing high schools. 
10. We recommend that State aid, equal to that granted any town or group 
of towns constituting a district, for industrial schools, be continued as at pres- 
ent provided for in the case of any town or group of towns constituting a 
district, for the establishment and maintenance of an independent agricultural 
school. (See chapter 505, acts of 1906, and chapter 572, acts of 1908.) 
We recommend that provision be made for the establishment of agricultural 
departments in existing high schools, with State aid, and with rigid definition 
and enforcement of vocational standards. 
The methods and vocational standards of instruction suggested 
for the development of such agricultural departments in existing 
high schools have nowhere been tried in the exact form proposed in 
this report. Departments somewhat of this type may be found in 
14 schools in the Province of Ontario. The plan proposes for the 
department at least one teacher, a practical man with an agricultural 
college training, who shall devote his entire time to farming subjects. 
His services should be rendered through the growing and harvesting 
seasons, in part as instructor in agriculture at the school and in part 
as supervisor of school projects at the homes of the students. The 
department should have the exclusive use of a well-lighted class- 
room fitted in such a way as would permit indoor demonstrations of 
farm animals and machinery. The equipment should include garden 
tools and laboratory apparatus, a hotbed and cold frame, a small 
greenhouse, and an acre of land for garden, nursery, and demonstra- 
tion plats. The materials, implements, and animals required for 
demonstration should be brought to the school by the students, or 
should be studied on thrifty farms not too far distant. 
The department should offer training in the science and art of 
agriculture as an elective subject for high school pupils, and also 
open to pupils who intend to be farmers, even though they might not 
be able to pursue successfully certain other branches of study offered 
by the school. The dominant motive of the department should be 
agricultural and vocational. 
As the most promising solution of the problem of securing effective 
vocational training in agriculture, the report recommends that the 
home farms of the pupils be utilized in what may be termed “ part- 
time work” in agriculture. This means that the pupil would do at 
his home productive farm work closely correlated to the study work 
in the school, and under the supervision of the teacher of agriculture. 
The plan suggested calls the home work a “ project.” A “farming 
project” as the term is used in the report “is a thing to be done on 
the farm, which, in the preparation for doing it and in the carry- 
ing of it out to a successful result, would involve a thorough-going
-P-A-G-E-356
336 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
     
     
                         
    
       
                           
   educational process.” Among farm projects suggested are: Keeping 
a pen of poultry, caring for a select part of an orchard, raising a 
specified crop of potatoes, caring for a cow, etc. 
The farmer and his farm must constitute the fundamental-factor in the prac- 
tical training of the boy. * * * In the use of the home time of the pupil 
the fullest value of the agricultural course will come from the fullest possible 
participation of the boy in the ordinary routine of farm work as usually carried 
out by the parent; but the greatest benefit of the school can not be had with- 
out the use of a part of the boy’s time, during the hours spent at home, for 
strictly school purposes. * * * In directing the boy in the discharge of his 
projects, the school must of necessity, it is believed, undertake the supervision 
of a portion of his work at home. Supervision of part-time work in agriculture 
would not be an attempt on the part of the school to interfere with the private 
management of the farms of the parents. Supervision would, nevertheless, be a 
continuous effort by the school to assist, advise, and encourage the student in 
applying under home conditions farm methods which had proved successful 
elsewhere, and thus to cause the practical training of the student to result in 
vocational efficiency. 
The plan provides that the division of time in carrying out the 
school and home-farm cooperative method of training, should be 
about as follows: For the execution of the projects, including work 
during vacations and other out-of-school hours, 50 per cent; for the 
related study, 30 per cent; for systematic courses in English, history, 
civics, mathematics, and other subjects of general culture and good 
citizenship, the remaining 20 per cent. 
MICHIGAN, 
The Michigan State Commission on Industrial and Agricultural 
Education, in a report to the governor of the State under date of 
December 1, 1910, recommend for the State of Michigan, first, the in- 
troduction of courses in agriculture, manual training, and home eco- 
nomics in all high schools; second, the certification of all teachers of 
agricultural and industrial subjects; third, State supervision of all 
agricultural and industrial courses in the public schools; fourth, 
limited State aid for such courses. The commission report in favor 
of agricultural courses in regular high schools, rather than the estab- 
lishment of independent agricultural schools. The State, in 1907, 
authorized the establishment of county agricultural high schools; 
one only had been established previous to the present year, the Me- 
nominee County school, Four-year agricultural courses were given| 
in 6 high schools in 1909-10, and in 10 in 1910-11. This work was in- 
troduced largely through the influence of the department of agri- 
cultural education of the State agricultural college, and the cours 
were carried out under the supervision of that department. The re 
port of the commission is based largely upon the experience wit! 
these two sorts of schools.

   A similar committee in Wisconsin, known as the commission upon 
the plans for the extension of industrial and agricultural training, 
have reported (Jan. 10, 1911) in favor of increasing the amount of 
agriculture taught in the county training schools from one unit to 
two, a unit representing a full one-year course; special State aid to 
consolidated rural schools giving courses in agriculture; also to State 
graded schools, township high schools, and city high schools, pro- 
vided that at least two units of agriculture be given and the courses 
be approved by the State superintendent of public instruction. Act- 
ing upon this recommendation, the legislature has provided for State 
aid of $250 for each department of agriculture established in connec- 
tion with any free high school. 
SOUTH CAROLINA. 
A special commission in South Carolina, appointed to investigate 
and report upon the advisability of establishing and maintaining 
agricultural schools and branch experiment stations, recommend 
that, instead of establishing separate agricultural schools, the State 
create a commission on agricultural education to consist of one mem- 
ber of the board of trustees of Clemson College, the dean of the 
agricultural department of the college, the professor of secondary 
education of the University of South Carolina, and the professors 
of elementary agriculture and elementary education at Winthrop 
Normal and Industrial College. This commission would appoint a 
supervisor of agricultural education, who would be an officer of the 
State department of education and may be a professor in Clemson 
College. The commission would have general charge of the intro- 
uction of agricultural education into the schools of the State. The 
supervisor of agricultural education would prepare and distribute 
ulletins for the public-school teachers, visit schools and aid in the 
tablishment of agricultural instruction, and act as a general ad- 
iser on all that pertains to agricultural education in the public 
chools. The commission recommend that Clemson College, Win- 
hrop College, and the State University offer special courses designed 
© prepare teachers of agriculture for the elementary and secondary 
chools. 
MAINE. 
The Maine Legislature in 1909 authorized the State superintendent 
f public instruction to conduct an investigation of systems of indus- 
rial education in other States and countries. The State superin- 
endent appointed to act for him six representative men of the State.

Their recommendations relative to agricultural education, manual 
training, and domestic science, are, first, the introduction of drawing, 
manual training, and domestic science into all grades of the elemen- 
tary schools; second, greater emphasis on local geography and local 
industries; third, school and home gardens; fourth, special courses 
for training teachers in agriculture, manual training, and domestic 
science; fifth, encouragement by the State of courses in these subjects 
in public high schools and academies; sixth, evening continuation 
courses in industrial and manufacturing centers; seventh, permissive 
legislation for the establishment of separate trade schools. The com- 
mission expresses the belief “ that upon the public school system of 
the rural sections of Maine depends the further development of her 
agricultural interests; ” and it recommends for rural schools: Better- 
equipped and more permanently employed teachers whose minimum 
qualifications and minimum salary shall be fixed by the State; expert 
rural-school supervision; consolidation where possible and seemingly 
advisable; the introduction of instruction in elementary agriculture. 
IMPORTANT LEGISLATION. 
NORTH CAROLINA. 
The Legislature of North Carolina, in an act approved March 3, 
1911, made provision for “ county farm-life schools,” for the training 
and preparation of boys and girls for farm life and home making. 
The course of study, subject to the approval of the State superin- 
tendent of public instruction, shall include practical work on the 
farm by the boys and practical work in all subjects relating to house- 
keeping and home making by the girls. A high-school department 
shall be conducted in connection with these schools, offering the 
course of study prescribed under the public high-school law of the| 
State for first-grade high schools. The farm-life school and the| 
high-school department shall both be under the control and manage- 
ment of a board of trustees, consisting of one member from eacl 
township in the county. The schools may not be located in any cit; 
or town of more than 1,000 inhabitants nor within 2 miles of the cor

quired subjects except Latin, Greek, and modern languages, including 
an additional certificate from the State board of examiners and the 
president of the North Carolina College of Agriculture and Mechanic 
Arts, stating that he has furnished evidence satisfactory to them of 
his qualifications by special training and practical experience for 
said position. A similar certificate is required for teachers for the 
special training of girls for home making and housekeeping. 
In addition to the regular courses these schools shall conduct agri- 
cultural farm-life extension and demonstration work and shall offer 
short courses in farm-life studies for adult men and women. AII of. 
the work of each school shall be under the general supervision of the 
county superintendent of public instruction, the school being in all 
respects an organic part of the county public-school system. 
Craven County voted, during the past summer, to establish a school 
under the provisions of this act. In Guilford County, under a special 
provision of the legislature, the agricultural work began in Septem- 
ber in three public high schools.    
   
      
    
    
      
   
                    
       
    
   
    
    NORTH DAKOTA. 
The Legislature of North Dakota, in the 1911 session, passed sev- 
cral acts of importance relative to agricultural education. “Lessons 
in nature study and elements of agriculture” has been added to the 
branches to be taught in all common schools, and agriculture may be 
offered as an optional subject for a teacher’s certificate. A law to 
provide for the establishment and maintenance of a department of 
agriculture, manual training, and domestic science in State high, 
graded, and consolidated schools provides that any such school hav- 
ling the proper facilities may, upon application to the high-school 
board, be designated to maintain an agricultural department. Each 
such school shall employ trained instructors in agriculture, manual 
raining, and domestic science and provide at least 10 acres of land 
uitable for a school garden. Said department “ shall offer instruc- 
ion in soils, crops, fertilizers, drainage, farm machinery, farm build- 
ngs, breeds of live stock, stock judging, animal diseases and remedies, 
roduction, testing and hauling of milk and cream, the manufacture of 
utter and cheese, the growth of fruit and berries, management of or- 
shards, market garden and vegetable crops, cereal grains, fine seeds, 
okkeeping and farm accounts, and all other matters pertaining to 
eneral practice.” Each school shall receive annually $2,500 State aid. 
his bill will not become effective immediately, as the section ap- 
ropriating money for such schools for 1911-12 was vetoed by the 
overnor for the reason that the revenues of the State had been ex- 
eeded by other appropriations. All other portions of the bill were 
pproved.

   An act, approved March 6, 1911, provides for county agricultural 
and training schools, said schools to give instruction in agriculture, 
domestic economy, manual training, and for training of teachers for 
the rural schools. The schools are to be established by vote of the 
citizens of the county. Buildings and land must be presented by any 
city or village desiring the location of such school. It is the intent 
of the act to establish schools the yearly cost of maintenance of which 
will not exceed $6,000 each, the State to pay one-half and the county 
one-half. 
Each school shall be controlled by a board of trustees, including 
four members appointed by the county commissioners, and the county 
superintendent of schools, who shall in all cases be secretary of the 
board. There is provided “a State agricultural and training school 
board, which shall consist of the president of the State agricultural 
college, the State superintendent of public instruction, and three 
practical farmers, who shall be appointed by the governor.” This 
board shall prescribe the course of study to be pursued in the county 
agricultural and training schools, which shall include, first, instruc- 
tion in the elements of agriculture, including the study of soil, horti- 
culture, and plant life, animal life on the farm, a system of farm 
accounts, and manual training and domestic economy ; second, instruc- 
tion in the common branches and such other branches as are necessary 
for the training of teachers in the rural schools, in methods of school 
management and provisions for observation and practice in the art 
of teaching. 
The State board of agricultural and training schools shall deter- 
mine the qualifications to be required of the principal and other 
teachers in said school, and the president and secretary of said State} 
board shall each have a vote in the election and in fixing the salaries 
of the principals of said schools. The other teachers shall be elected] 
by the board of trustees of each school established under this act. It] 
is provided that the course of study in the department of agriculture} 
shall be so framed as to correlate with the courses of study in th 
State agricultural colleges so that students from the county schools| 
shall be admitted without examination to the class in the State agri- 
cultural college next following that which they have completed i 
the county school. The superintendent of public instruction and th 
president of the Agricultural College shall visit and inspect eac 
school at least once each year, and report to the governor, with ref. 
erence to property, management, instruction, and efficiency of the 
schools, and make such recommendations as in their judgment wil 
further the efficiency and usefulness of any or all such schools.

TEXAS, 
An act of the Legislature of Texas, approved March 6, 1911, pro- 
vides that “it shall be the duty of the State board of education to 
duplicate, by an appropriation out of money provided for by this act, 
an amount not less than $500, nor more than $1,500, that shall have 
been set apart by the trustees of a public high school of the first class 
or of the second class, * * * an amount of not less than $500, 
nor more than $1,000, that shall have been set apart by the trustees of 
a public high school of the third class in a common school district, 
for establishing, equipping, and maintaining a department of agri- 
culture, * * *. Such appropriation shall not be made more than 
twice to the same school.” The board of trustees of.the high school 
applying for State aid for a department of agriculture must provide 
ample room and laboratory for its teaching, at least 3 acres of land, 
conveniently located, which shall be well adapted to the production 
of farm and garden plants, and shall employ a teacher who has 
received special training for giving efficient instruction in the subject. 
Schools must give evidence that after the State aid is withdrawn, the 
department of agriculture will be continued. . No school shall receive 
State aid without the recommendation of the State superintendent of 
public instruction. 
NEW YORK. 
An act in New York State, approved July 26, 1911, provides for 
an advisory board to consider plans for the promotion and direction 
of agricultural education and the advancement of country life. This 
board is to consist of 12 members, including the director of the State 
agricultural college, the director of the State experiment station, the 
deans of the State schools of agriculture at Alfred University, St. 
Lawrence University, and Morrisville, a member of the State fair 
commission, and 3 other persons appointed by the governor. An act, 
approved July 28, 1911, provides for a new State school of agricul- 
ture to be located at Cobleskill, Schoharie County, to be known as the 
Schoharie State School of Agriculture. The school will give instruc- 
tion in agriculture, mechanic arts, and home making, and will engage 
in agricultural extension teaching. It shall be controlled by a board 
of trustees, including the State commissioners of education and agri- 
culture, and 5 others appointed by the governor. For establishing 
the school $50,000 is appropriated. 
Enactments of other legislatures in the 1911 session are given in 
the section on the status of agricultural instruction in the various 
States. Several measures presented and discussed in various legis- 
latures, but which have not yet been enacted, deserve mention.

    842 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
PROPOSED MEASURES IN VARIOUS STATES. 
In California a bill was introduced authorizing instruction in 
manual training, domestic science, agriculture, horticulture, dairying, 
and military training in all of the high schools of the State. In 
Connecticut one proposed measure provided that the State board of 
education should provide for agricultural courses in high schools 
applying for the same, the State to pay $1,000 and the town $500 
toward the salary of the instructor, the State and town to share equally 
the expense of the plant and apparatus. Another would have re- 
quired the State board of education to establish work in agriculture, 
carpentry, blacksmithing, and household arts in rural high schools, 
the State to pay two-thirds of the cost, not to exceed $2,000 to any 
one school; and a third proposed a State agent to supervise agricul- 
tural education, at a salary of $2,500. In Iowa it was proposed to 
require agriculture and home economics in all schools, and for 
teachers’ certificates. A bill was introduced in the Nebraska Legis- 
lature providing for an assistant county superintendent for counties 
having more than 1,000 school population, said assistant to devote his 
entire time to the supervision of instruction in agriculture, manual 
training, and domestic science in rural schools. Many bills have been 
introduced into the Legislature of New York. Additional State 
schools of agriculture at Delphi and at; Keuka College were considered ; 
also a bill to provide for county teachers’ training schools in agricul- 
ture. In Ohio, State aid was considered for departments of agricul- 
ture and domestic science in high schools to equal one-half the cost 
of the department. In South Dakota the advisability of establishing 
“high schools of agriculture, industrial arts, and home making,” 
was considered. Measures were debated in Texas proposing to-estab- 
lish a “ North Texas Agricultural College at McKenney ”, an agri- 
cultural school at Greenville, and also congressional district agricul- 
tural schools. A bill in Utah proposed to require instruction in agri- 
culture in schools of all cities and farming communities. In Wash- 
ington a measure was introduced to create a committee of five to be 
appointed by the governor and to be known as the Washington In- 
dustrial Education Commission to investigate the needs and methods 
of agriculture and industrial education, and to report in 1913. 
In Congress several bills were introduced proposing aid for educa- 
tion in agriculture, but on account of matters of greater interest 
received little attention. On March 3, 1911, Senator Carroll S. Page, 
of Vermont, introduced a bill (S. 10905) “To cooperate with the 
States in encouraging instruction in agriculture, the trades and 
industries, and home economics in secondary schools; in preparing 
teachers for those vocational subjects in State normal schools; and to 
appropriate money therefor and to regulate its expenditure.” The
-P-A-G-E-363
  
AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION, 843 
bill follows very closely the Davis and Dolliver bills of the previous 
years, but it attempts to better the portions of those bills which were 
most severely criticised. Some of the features peculiar to the Page 
bill are the following: 
States and Territories accepting the provisions of this act shall receive for 
the respective lines of education and research only such portions of the full 
amount to which each State and Territory would be entitled of the respective 
funds to be used for the purpose of this act as in the judgment of the Secretary 
of the Interior it has made ample preparation to utilize to advantage, and such 
funds as would otherwise be allotted to the respective States, but as are not by 
him authorized to be used, shall remain in the Treasury. 
That the funds appropriated in this act for instruction in agricultural sec- 
ondary schools in the respective districts provided for in this act shall be used 
only for distinctive studies in agriculture and home economics; the funds appro- 
priated for instruction in public secondary schools shall be used only for dis- 
tinctive instruction in the trades and industries, home economics, and agricul- 
ture, in separate schools organized for that purpose, or in separate units or 
courses organized as departments under a properly qualified head in regular 
secondary schools; the funds appropriated for instruction in State and Territo- 
rial normal schools shall be used only for distinctive studies in agriculture, home 
economics, and the trades and industries in separate units and courses organized 
as departments under a properly qualified head; * * * That all States, 
Territories, and the District of Columbia accepting these funds shall provide 
other funds with which to pay the cost of providing the necessary lands and 
buildings, and to pay the cost of all instruction in such other and general studies 
as shall complete well-rounded courses, the main purposes of which are to give 
vocational as well as general preparation in agriculture, the trades and indus- 
tries, and home making, suited to the needs of the respective sections and com- 
munities of the United States. 
An identical bill (S. 8) was introduced into the Sixty-second 
Congress, first session, by Senator Page, on April 6, 1911. Repre- 
sentative C. R. Davis, of Minnesota, on April 20, 1911, introduced a 
bill (H. R. 6333) which differs in no respect from his bill of Febru- 
ary 8, 1910 (H. R. 20374), reviewed in this report for 1910. Another 
bill (H. R. 2907) very similar to the Davis bill was introduced by 
Representative William B. Wilson, of Pennsylvania, on April 10, 
1911, and a revision of the bill, including provisions for extension 
work in the agricultural colleges, was introduced on June 29, 1911 
(HL R. 12156). 
On April 24, 1911, Senator L. S. Overman, of North Carolina, 
introduced a bill (S. 1563) “To apply a part of the proceeds from 
the sale of public lands to the support and maintenance of farm-life 
schools of 4, and in the rural high schools of 3. It is required for 
of farming.” This measure proposes that there shall be paid to each 
State and Territory for the purpose indicated in the title the sum of 
$25,000 for the year ending June 30, 1911, and an annual increase of 
the amount of such— 
appropriation thereafter for ten years by an additional sum of one thousand 
dollars over the preceding year, and the anneal amount to be paid thereafter to
-P-A-G-E-364
    344 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
each State and Territory shall be thirty-five thousand dollars, to be applied only 
to instruction in agriculture, the English language, and various branches of 
mathematical, physical, natural, and economic science, with special reference to 
their applications in farm life, and to the facilities of such instruction, such as 
“to prepare boys for agricultural pursuits and farm life and girls for home 
making and housekeeping on the farm, including practical work on the farm by 
the boys and practical work in all subjects relating to housekeeping and home 
making by the girls”: Provided, That no State or Territory shall receive any 
of the benefits of this act unless such State or Territory shall appropriate a 
sum at least equal to the amount herein appropriated for a similar purpose. 
STATUS OF INSTRUCTION IN ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY AGRICULTURE. 
The following statements of the status of instruction in agriculture 
in elementary and secondary public schools show that agriculture is 
a required subject in all common schools of 12 States, in the rural 
schools of 5, and in the rural high schools of 8. It is required for 
teachers’ certificates in 16 and is optional in 3. Special agricultural 
schools receiving State aid are established in 16 States and are au- 
thorized in North Dakota. State aid to departments of agriculture 
in high schools is given in 12 States. Secondary schools of agricul- 
ture or secondary courses in agriculture, in addition to the collegiate 
courses, are maintained by the State agricultural colleges of 31 States. 
Summer schools giving elementary agriculture for teachers are con- 
ducted by 34 of these institutions, and short courses for farmers, 
extending from 2 to 12 weeks, are maintained by the majority of them.

cultural schools, which may receive State aid equal to one-half the 
cost of maintenance. Smith’s Agricultural School at Northampton 
is the only one in operation. The Montague Agricultural School, 
after receiving State aid for three years, has been closed. By act 
of the legislature in 1911 State aid equal to two-thirds of the salary 
of a special instructor devoting his entire time to agriculture is 
given to high schools establishing departments of agriculture of the 
type recommended by the State board of education in its report on 
agriculture and industrial education, described on page 334. The 
Petersham Agricultural High School gives a four-year course in agri- 
culture, and now receives State aid under this act. The State boar 
of education has appointed an agent to supervise agricultural depart 
ments so established. Agriculture is taught in at least 18 hig’ 
schools and in the State normal schools at Bridgewater, Hyannis, an 
North Adams. A commission appointed by the State board of edu 
cation to investigate the needs of agricultural éducation in the Stat 
has made an exhaustive study and submitted a valuable report, i 
which they recommend State aid for agricultural departments i 
existing high schools. 
Michigan—Instruction in agriculture is specifically authorized i

lished in 1911 at Sault Ste. Marie. Four-year courses in agriculture 
are given by 10 high schools without State aid. Agriculture is taught 
at the State normal schools at Kalamazoo, Marquette, and Mount 
Pleasant, and in many of the county normal training schools. A 
special commission appointed to investigate the needs of industrial 
and agricultural education has reported to the governor recommend- 
ing the introduction of agriculture, manual training, and home eco- 
nomics in all high schools of the State, with State aid, and the cer- 
tification of teachers of agricultural and industrial subjects. By an 
act of 1909 the State board of agriculture, on recommendation of the 
president of the State agricultural college, is authorized to grant 
agricultural teachers’ certificates to persons who have completed the 
regular four years’ course in agriculture, together with a course in 
pedagogics covering at least a half year’s special instruction in that 
subject. 
Minnesota—Fifty consolidated rural schools were authorized in 
1905, each to have 10 acres of land for instruction in farming; special 
State aid to not more than one such school in each county. County 
agricultural high schools were authorized in 1905. For properly 
equipped high schools maintaining agricultural departments ap- 
proved by the State department of education the State will contribute 
two-thirds the cost of maintenance, not exceeding $2,500 annually. 
Ten such schools are now established, located at Albert Lea, Alexan- 
dria, Canby, Cokato, Glencoe, Hinckley, Lewiston, McIntosh, Red 
Wing, and Wells. A recent act of the legislature permits the estab- 
lishment of 20 more such schools. These schools are to be located at

facts regarding their organization, equipment, and course of study. 
Special schools of agriculture and public high schools. with agri- 
cultural departments are both included. 
Smith’s Agricultural School and Northampton School of Indus- 
tries, located at Northampton, Mass., is an independent agricultural 
and industrial school, opened in 1908, supported in part by the State 
and in part by the income of funds bequeathed to Northampton by 
Oliver Smith. This fund now amounts to about $310,660 and yields 
annually approximately $12,000. The total annual maintenance 
budget of the school is about $20,000. The institution is controlled 
by a local board of trustees elected by the voters of the city of 
Northampton. It has a main building costing $60,000, and farm 
buildings, equipment, and land valued at $25,000. The farm con- 
tains 100 acres. 
A striking feature of the school plant is the main building, which 
consists in fact of four separate buildings arranged in such a way 
as to inclose completely a rectangle one-quarter of an acre in extent 
and about twice as long as wide. At the front, on one of the long 
sides of the rectangle, stands the office building, containing several 
recitation rooms; at the ends are the science building and the trades 
building, respectively; and in the rear is an auditorium with raised 
seats facing the inclosure. The inclosed rectangle is covered with 
a trestle roof, the four buildings with their connecting walls form- 
ing the sides of this inclosed and covered arena, which is well lighted 
from above. The partition between the arena and the auditorium 
is movable, and when pushed aside allows persons seated in the 
auditorium a view of the entire floor space, nearly one-fourth of an 
acre in extent. The buildings are of brick and limestone. The floor 
of the arena is cement. 
Students 14 years of age or over are admitted to the school with- 
out further entrance requirements. They are allowed to remain 
only so long as they continue to show themselves able to do the 
required work. Three four-year courses of study are given, each 
strictly vocational in its purpose, designed respectively to prepare 
for farming, for mechanical work, and for housekeeping and home 
making. The course in agriculture is as follows, the first figures 
given being the number of recitation periods of 40 minutes each per 
year, the figures following in parentheses indicating the additional 
number of periods given to laboratory or practical work.

A fair representative of the congressional district agricultural 
school is the Second District Agricultural School, located at Tifton, 
Ga. This school is one of the 11 institutions established by act of 
the State legislature of 1906. It opened for instruction in 1908, and 
receives annually about $10,000 from the State. Tuition is free to 
citizens of the district. It is equipped with a main building for 
recitation and laboratory purposes, a boys’ dormitory with accom- 
modations for 100 boys, a girls’ building with dormitory rooms for 
80 girls, and appointments for instruction in domestic science, a din- 
ing hall, a barn, and a shop. The main building and the dormitories 
are of brick, and cost together $48,500; the other buildings are of 
wood. The farm contains 315 acres of land, and is well stocked and 
equipped. 
There were 90 boys and 47 girls enrolled during the past year. 
The faculty consists of 3 men and 2 women, all well trained. The 
principal and assistant principal have had special training in agri- 
culture. The course of study is as follows, the figures indicating the 
number of hours per week:

The course in agriculture includes, in the first year, a study of the 
general subject with the use of Duggar’s Agriculture for Southern 
Schools as a text, and a study of plant life as outlined in Atkinson’s 
text. The second year is devoted to soils, including methods of cul- 
tivation, soil moisture, drainage, soil fertility, manures and fertilizers, 
and rotation of crops. Burkett’s textbook on soils is the basis of the 
year’s work. In addition one period a week is given to bacteriology, 
treating the subject as especially related to agriculture and to pub- 
lic health. The third year is given to horticulture and vegetable 
gardening and to agricultural botany. Bailey’s text in botany is 
used in the latter course. In the last year field crops are studied, 
such as cotton, corn, oats, and sweet potatoes; also animal husbandry, 
including feeding, breeds and breeding, dairying, beef and pork pro- 
duction, and sheep, poultry, horse, and mule raising. Economic 
zoology is given in this year also, dealing especially with the farm 
friends and enemies. Little has been done in farm mechanics on ac- 
count of the lack of facilities. A course has just been added including 
instruction and practice in the care of farm tools and machinery, ele- 
mentary carpentry, concrete work, plumbing, blacksmithing, and 
mechanical drawing. Each class will devote two hours a week to this 
course. 
The Farragut School at Concord, Tenn., is a good type of a coun- 
try high school with courses, including agriculture, designed to pre- 
pare boys and girls for life and citizenship in the country. The 
building is located a mile and a half from the village. It is of brick, 
2 stories high, and contains 8 recitation rooms, a small library, 
and a study hall which, when the desks are removed, will seat 300 
people. The domestic-science room is in the basement and is fur- 
nished with individual outfits for a class of 12. The manual-training 
room is also in the basement and is fitted with 12 carpenter benches

and the necessary tools. The rest of the basement is occupied by 
toilet rooms with sanitary closets and shower baths. Three rooms of 
the first floor are used for elementary grades. The fourth room is a 
laboratory for biology, physics, chemistry, and agriculture. The 
school owns 12 acres of land, 6 of which are used for demonstration 
work connected with the instruction in agriculture; also a mare, two 
colts, and a flock of hens. 
Three courses of study are offered: A Latin course, an English- 
science course, and an agricultural course, including manual training 
and home economics. Ninety per cent of the total high-school en- 
rollment, which was about 100 in 1910-11, are taking the agricultural 
course. The work is arranged as follows; the figures being the num- 
ber of recitation and laboratory periods a week:

The instruction in agriculture deals largely with problems con- 
nected with the growth and improvement of plants, including soils 
and soil fertility, methods of cultivation, horticulture, and floricul- 
ture, with a less amount of work in animal husbandry, including 
poultry. For the work in animal husbandry the school makes use of 
the stock on the neighboring farms. Girls take the entire course in 
agriculture in preparation for home-making and for teaching in the 
rural schools. 
A prominent feature of the work of the school is its community 
work in Knox County. For three years a “ moonlight social ” has 
been held monthly at the school, attended by farmers and their fam- 
ilies. A program is given containing music and a discussion of some 
subject of general interest pertaining to farm life. For these meet- 
ings outside speakers are sometimes obtained. No phase of farm and| 
home life is omitted. Once a year an all-day meeting is held, wit
-P-A-G-E-379
  
  AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION. 359 
lectures on farming and home-making, a baseball game, and an op- 
portunity for sociability. The school has a small library of good 
books and a collection of 4,000 agricultural bulletins, which are loaned 
to the farmers of the section. The principal of the school is a grad- 
uate of the New York State College of Agriculture. He teaches the 
sciences and agriculture in the school, leads many of the discussions 
at the moonlight socials, and acts to some extent as adviser to the 
farmers with whom he keeps in close touch by personal visits. 
In September, 1909, four-year courses in agriculture were intro- 
duced into six high schools in Michigan, into four others in 1910, and 
into five additional schools in 1911. The first six are located at Hills- 
dale, Hudson, Lawton, North Adams, Otsego, and St. Louis; the next 
four at Northville, Saline, Union City, and Watervielt. The courses 
introduced at the beginning of the present year were in the high 
schools of Mason, South Haven, St. Johns, Traverse City, and Man- 
chester. None of these schools receives State aid. The agricultural 
work is under the supervision of the professor of agricultural educa- 
tion in the State agricultural college. The courses are taught by 
graduates of the college who in most instances teach other sciences 
as well. The average annual additional cost of maintenance by the 
introduction of such courses was $360. Of the 494 boys enrolled in 
the 10 schools teaching agriculture in 1910-11, 574 per cent elected 
the courses in agriculture. The agricultural work in all of these 
schools requires one-fourth of the student’s time, the course being 
practically the same: First year, agricultural botany; second year, 
farm crops, soils and tillage, horticulture and entomology ; third year, 
live stock, dairying, soils and soil physics; fourth year, live stock im- 
provement and feeding, poultry, farm management, farm mechanics, 
and machinery. The work follows closely a syllabus for the guidance 
of the instructors published by the State agricultural college. 
A private secondary school at Winona Lake, Ind., known as the 
Winona College of Agriculture, is an institution of a distinct type 
among agricultural schools. In this school nothing but agriculture is 
taught and this agriculture is intended to be in the form that can be 
best applied to the actual problems of the farm and its different de- 
velopments. The course requires two years to complete and is given 
below. A choice of one of the three following subjects, each requir- 
ing 12 hours a week, is given in the spring term of the second year: 
Advanced live-stock management, advanced work in soils, and com- 
mercial orchard management. 
About one-fourth of the time in all of these courses is given to lab- 
oratory work, the major portion of which is carried on at the school 
farm where the student works under the direct supervision of the in- 
structor. In addition the curriculum is so arranged as to give each 
student actual work in all phases of farming. The institution has

3 instructors who are graduates of State agricultural colleges. It 
has graduated 5 classes including about 60 boys, nearly all of whom 
are now engaged in actual farming. The enrollment for the past 
year was 67. A common-school education is necessary for admission. 
Students are graded in two divisions according to their ability to do 
more or less difficult work. The course of study is as follows:

PREPARATION OF TEACHERS 1N SECONDARY AND ELEMENTARY 
AGRICULTURE. 
IN STATE AGRICULTURAL COLLEGES. 
The introduction of instruction in agriculture into the school cur- 
riculum has created a greater demand for teachers with special train- 
ing for the work than can at present be supplied. While agriculture 
as a high-school science is being rapidly rounded into pedagogical 
form, it is yet so far in the experimental stage of its development that 
teachers with special training are essential. Probably no factor has 
had more influence in retarding the introduction of instruction in 
this subject into the public schools than the lack of instructors 
properly qualified, with training in both pedagogy and in technical 
and practical agriculture. 
The majority of such teachers must be supplied by the State col- 
leges of agriculture and mechanic arts. To encourage these institu- 
tions to prepare special teachers of agriculture, Congress, in the   
-P-A-G-E-381
  AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION, 361 
Nelson amendment to the appropriation bill for the Department of 
Agriculture, approved March 4, 1907, providing further aid to the 
colleges of agriculture and mechanic arts established under the pro- 
visions of the land-grant act of 1862 and receiving the benefits of 
the act of August 30, 1890, added the proviso “that said colleges 
may use a portion of this money for providing courses for the special 
preparation of instructors for teaching the elements of agriculture 
and the mechanic arts.” Under this act each State is now receiving 
annually for the benefit of its college of agriculture and mechanic 
arts the sum of $25,000. 
A special inquiry was made of these institutions by the Bureau 
of Education during the past summer to determine what each is 
doing to prepare special teachers of agriculture. There are 50 of 
these colleges, not including the separate institutions for colored 
students; 12 of them are offering no special courses for students pre- 
paring to teach, although many of their graduates with no prepara- 
tion but their general college course and technical agricultural courses 
have become instructors in agriculture in secondary schools; 3 of 
these offer summer-school courses in agriculture for elementary 
teachers. Thirteen others, having already a department or school 
of education when the act of Congess was passed, now allow students 
in the agricultural courses to elect certain courses in education. Ten 
others have added courses in psychology and general education, 
and 13 have added departments of agricultural education, which 
give courses in methods of teaching agriculture and in school agri- 
culture as well as in general pedagogy. Nine offer special one 
or two year courses for teachers of agriculture, and 30 conduct 
summer schools offering courses in agriculture for elementary teach- 
lers. The departments of agricultural education in many cases are giv- 
ing special aid to instructors in public schools teaching agriculture, 
nd are also giving special instruction in agricultural pedagogy and 
griculture for teachers in summer schools. Among the 17 institu- 
‘ions for colored students, Hampton Institute (Virginia) is the only 
ne preparing special teachers of agriculture; 8 others require pupils 
m their normal course to take an elementary course in agriculture. 
The following paragraphs give in brief form the names of the 
nstitutions which are offering special preparation for teachers of 
lementary agriculture with the courses in agricultural education 
where such courses are given. All courses are stated in semester- 
ours, a semester-hour being one hour a week for a semester, or half 
bear.

IN STATE NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
The inclusion of agriculture as a required subject for teachers’ cer- 
tificates in many States, and the demand in other States for instruc- 
tion in agriculture in elementary schools, consolidated rural schools, 
-and rural high schools, has forced many of the normal schools into 
offering courses to fill this demand. Of the 185 State normal schools 
in the United States, 104 offered courses in agriculture during the 
past year; 6 others, courses in school gardening; and 12, not counted 
in the 110 preceding, in nature study. 
The majority of the courses offered are brief, extending from 4 
to 12 weeks. A considerable number offer a full year’s course, and 
the North Adams (Mass.) State Normal gives-a 3 years’ course. 
In most instances the courses deal almost wholly with plant life, 
 
-P-A-G-E-388
      368 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
including a study of the problems most closely concerned with the 
growth and improvement of the plant. Some, in addition, are in- 
cluding a special study of horticulture and floriculture, and others 
poultry, animal husbandry, and dairying. The subject is taught in 
the majority of these schools by the instructor of the biological - 
sciences, although at least a score have instructors who are graduates 
of agricultural courses in State colleges of agriculture and are de- 
voting most of their time to the work in agriculture. 
An outline of the agricultural work in a few of the institutions 
selected from various sections of the country is included below. The 
courses selected are fair types of the various courses given by the 
normal schools that are doing substantial work in agricultural edu- 
cation. 
The State Normal School at Jacksonville, Ala., gives 120 hours in 
the fall and spring terms of the first year of the work for teachers’ 
certificates to agriculture. The textbook used is that adopted by the 
State for the public schools. The work covers the principles of main- 
taining and restoring the fertility of the soil, with emphasis on 
methods of cultivation and fertilization; standard breeds of live 
stock; feeds and feeding; cultivation and care of orchards and vine- 
yards, including grafting, pruning, and budding. The school main- 
tains a small experimental and botanical garden, a vineyard, an 
orchard of small fruits, and a flower garden. The subject is taught 
by the teacher of science, who has had no special training in agri- 
culture. 
The Los Angeles (Cal.) State Normal School gives a 48-hour 
course in agricultural nature study. “The object of this course is 
to give students a broad, sympathetic outlook upon agriculture, and 
to prepare them for teaching the essentials of this most fundamental 
occupation in a practical way. Each student is assigned a plot in 
the school garden, and in this are planted and cared for various vege- 
tables and flowers.” The institution is equipped with a greenhouse, 
a lath house, and land for school gardens. The agricultural work is 
confined almost wholly to a study of the many problems connected 
with the successful growing of plants. The instructor is a graduate 
of an agricultural college and gives his entire time to this work. 
The State Teachers College of Colorado, at Greeley, maintains a 
department of agricultural education offering 9 courses. The work 
is arranged especially for rural teachers, and a special diploma in 
elementary agriculture is given to students completing the course. 
The institution is equipped with a farm, nursery, gardens, green- 
house, and stables. The instructor is a graduate of an agricultural 
college. The courses given by the department are as follows, each 
being a 60-hour course: Nature study, elementary agriculture, school 
gardening, soils and crops of the farm, animals of the farm; dairy
-P-A-G-E-389

industry, and poultry husbandry; horticulture on the farm; the 
farm home; and rural sociology and the rural school. 
The State Normal School at Athens, Ga., in the new four-year di- 
ploma course devotes 108 hours to general agriculture the first year 
and 72 hours the third year; also 72 hours to school gardening and 36 
hours to rural economics in the fourth year. In the two-year diploma 
course, in the first year 72 hours are given to agriculture and 36 hours 
to nature study ; in the second year 18 hours are given to nature study 
and 36 hours to school gardening. The teacher of agriculture is 
especially trained for teaching agriculture and devotes his entire time 
to that subject. The nature study also is taught by a graduate of an 
agricultural college. 
The Illinois State Normal University, at Normal, offers 36 hours in 
agricultural nature study in the first year of the four-year course. 
The work is concerned largely with plant life. A course in experi- 
mental agriculture and practice teaching is given in the fourth year; 
this work includes individual experiments in agriculture, horticulture, 
floriculture, and the supervision of children in school gardens. 
These subjects are taught by the instructor in biology. 
The North Adams (Mass.) Normal School offers courses in school 
and home gardening, agriculture, horticulture, and nature study. 
These courses are arranged and conducted with the cooperation of 
the Massachusetts Agricultural College, which adds to the faculty 
of the normal school an instructor and supervisor who gives a por- 
tion of his time:to instruction at the normal school and its three 
training schools, a second portion to the promotion of elementary 
agriculture and nature study in the schools of Berkshire County, and 
the remainder to instruction at the college in the department of 
agricultural education. 
A three years’ agricultural course is offered, which includes all of 
the work in English, psychology, and pedagogy given in the regular 
two-year normal course. The agriculture in this course may be 
taken by a graduate of the regular two-year course, or by college 
graduates, in one year. The course is intended to prepare special 
teachers in agriculture. The strictly agricultural work is given by 
an instructor from the agricultural college; the allied sciences by the 
instructor in the natural sciences of the normal school. The course 
is as follows: 
I. Agriculture: Soils; plant life, structures, functions, and diseases; fertil- 
izers, tillage, crops; hotbeds, cold frames, and greenhouse; farm live stock, 
poultry, bees; dairy. 
' Horticulture: Flower and shrub gardens; window gardens; propagation, 
pruning, and cultivation; orchards and small fruits; forestry. 
Insects and birds: Economic importance; control of injurious insects.

mentary courses together extend through five terms of five hours a 
week and include a study of plant life, soils and soil- fertility, farm 
crops, grain judging, enemies and diseases of plants and their con- 
trol, crop rotation, feeds and feeding, live stock, poultry, dairying, 
and general farm management. The advanced course is a two-year 
course and includes one term’s work in each of the following: Dairy- 
ing, animal husbandry, orcharding, farm management, poultry rais- 
ing, and gardening. The institution has established a two-year 
agricultural high school, in which the students devote one-fourth of 
the time to agriculture or domestic science and one-eighth of the 
time to pedagogy as applied to rural school teaching. The course 
is intended to prepare young men and women for rural school work, 
and graduates will receive a State teacher’s certificate to teach in 
rural schools. The institution owns a model farm and good equip- 
ment for agricultural instruction. The instructor in agriculture is a 
man trained especially for teaching that subject. 
The Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute (colored), at 
Hampton, Va., offers a three years’ vocational course in agriculture 
and a special one-year course to students who have completed the 
vocational course and are preparing to teach agriculture. The one- 
year course includes the chemistry of soils, manures, and fertilizers; 
chemistry of dairy products; fermentation; milk testing; geology in 
its relation to soil formation; biology in its relation to plant and 
animal life; farm engineering, including a study of farm machinery 
and structures; and farm physics, including soil physics, the rela- 
tion of the atmosphere to agriculture, climatology, and the organic 
life in the soil and air. Students taking this course are required to

INTRODUCTION. 
The similarity of the problems of social and of industrial life in 
modern states is illustrated by world movements in education which 
take the same general direction under widely differing social and 
political conditions. The great movement of the present time is that 
for giving practical direction to school training and thus fitting the 
mass of young people more directly for the duties and conditions 
which await them. In the cities the purpose is conveniently termed 
“vocational.” As regards rural districts, it is not so easily defined 
nor so readily brought into systematic form; on the other hand, the 
new educational purpose is there more closely related to the general 
social life and becomes, therefore, a part of the larger rural im- 
provement problem. But, again, the conditions of rural life differ 
more widely in different countries than do the conditions of city life, 
and therefore experiments in rural education in one country are often 
not at all applicable to another. On the contrary, it has already been 
made clear that vocational training in cities may be reduced to a few 
general principles of wide application. This is the service that Dr. 
Kerschensteiner has rendered by his expositions of the movement in 
3871

  872 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
Munich. He emphasizes the universal element in particular experi- 
ments which he discusses. 
The new movement in rural education has spread to the whole 
world, and in almost every country has given rise to special efforts, 
which are instructive either as regards method or organization or 
adaptations. In English-speaking countries these efforts have taken 
one of two courses; they have been from the first either offshoots 
from the organized system of public education or they have arisen 
independently of the system. 
MEASURES FOR IMPROVING RURAL EDUCATION IN SCOTLAND. 
In every measure affecting the public provision for education in 
Scotland, two purposes are evident: (1) That of giving equal oppor- 
tunity to all children; (2) that of keeping all experiments in educa- 
tion within the province of the main system. At the same time there 
is a growing sense of distinctions between communities and individual 
children that must be considered for the highest interest of the in- 
dividual as well as for the general welfare. 
This dual purpose gives character to the supplementary courses 
authorized in elementary schools by a circular of instruction issued 
by the education department in 1903.1 In this circular the depart- 
ment expresses the conviction, based upon a careful consideration of 
facts, “ that the tendency—not confined to any one class of school— 
to make one and the same school with one and the same staff serve 
many different functions is the weak point of educational organiza- 
tion in Scotland as compared with that of other countries, with which, 
in other respects, Scotland might justly challenge comparison, and 
they are satisfied that increasing division of function as between 
different types of schools is an essential condition of further educa- 
tional progress.” 
The supplementary courses, intended to provide for differentia- 
tion at an elementary stage, take the place of the last two or three 
years of the ordinary course; pupils are admitted to them who have 
reached at least the fifth class of the regular course (normal age 11 
years) and who pass the required tests of qualification for the sup- 
plementary work. The authorized subjects of the courses are ar- 
ranged in four groups: (1) Commercial, (2) industrial, (3) course 
for rural schools, (4) household management (for girls). Detailed 
schedules under each division are published by the education depart- 
ment to serve as models, and special grants are allowed for the pupils 
attending. Apart from the conditions mentioned, the school au- 
thorities have large freedom in respect to the work.

Although the supplementary courses are not limited to rural 
schools, it is explicitly stated in the circular above referred to that 
in considering the problem the authorities have had constantly in 
mind the position of the small rural school taught by one teacher. 
The official programs which follow pertain to schools of this char- 
acter. 
SUPPLEMENTARY COURSES FOR RURAL SCHOOLS.’ 
Subjects common to all the supplementary courses, whether in 
cities or in rural districts, are: 
A.—The study of English. 
The main object of this study shall be to create a taste for good literature. 
The chief means of carrying on this study should be— 
(1) Systematic home reading, with properly directed choice of books. 
(2) An efficient system of reviewing, explaining, and testing in school the 
reading done at home. 
(3) The committing to memory, after discussion and explanation, of suit- 
able pieces of verse and of prose. 
(4) Systematic teaching and practice of English composition. 
B.— Certain studies bearing upon matters which it is of concern that all the 
pupils should know, whatever their occupations in after life are to be. 
Under this heading may be specified— 
(1) The laws of health. 
(2) Money matters—thrift, investment, insurance. 
(3) The conditions of trade and employment. 
(4) The institutions of government under which we live. 
(5) The Empire—its history, growth, and trade; our colonies and the 
openings for enterprise which they afford. 
(6) Nature study, drill, and singing. 
It is advised that in connection with civic instruction full use be 
made “of the specially prepared edition of the Ordnance Survey 
map of the district in which the school may be situated.” 
Special for rural schools. 
(1) Nature stwdy.—Continued so as to secure on the part of the pupils 
familiarity with— 
(a) The rocks, soils, and plants of the district ; 
(b) The life histories of weeds and insect pests, with the remedies against 
them ; 
(c) Wind and insect pollination of plants; 
(d) Relations of air, water, and soil to vegetable and animal life. 
Norr.—Instruction in the above subjects must throughout be of a practical 
character. To this end, school gardens should be formed and made use of; 
observations on bees and beekeeping should be made where possible; and 
advantage should be taken of any agricultural experiment stations in the 
neighborhood. 
When the instruction is of a sufficiently practical character, given through 
the medium of a school garden, special grants will be allowed. 
(2) Geometry.—aAs in the industrial course, but more especially in its appli- 
cations to land measuring and surveying.

(3) Study of newspaper market reports.—With exercises and calculations 
based upon them. 
(4) The keeping of accounts. 
(5) Optional_—Woodwork (or ironwork) as above. 
Household management (girls’) course. 
(1) Housekeeping.—Including— 
(a) Care of rooms, furnishings, and clothing; 
(b) Marketing, and the keeping of household accounts; 
(¢) Cookery ; 
(d) Laundry work; 
(e) Needlework—especially mending, darning, and cutting out. 
Notr.—All the above subjects must be taught practically. 
(2) Special extension of such topics as bear upon the health of the individual 
and of the family. 
(8) Arithmetic.—As applied in the calculation of prices and the practical use 
of the common weights and measures. 
(4) Scale drawing.—As applied to the making of diagrams for cutting out 
(optional). 
(5) Dressmaking, and the use and care of the sewing machine (optional). 
PRESENT STATUS OF SUPPLEMENTARY COURSES. 
The following information relative to the general working of this 
important adjunct to the elementary schools is derived from the 
latest report of the Scotch Education Department covering the year 
1909-10. 
In order to assist rural districts in maintaining supplementary 
courses the education committees of several counties, in particular 
Midlothian and West Lothian, have come to the help of the school 
managers by employing, in each case, a staff of special teachers for 
supplementary courses whose services may be obtained by rural school 
boards on reasonable terms. These committees also show every dis- 
position to assist school boards in providing equipment required for 
the supplementary studies, and it is believed that in another year sup- 
plementary courses will be in operation in every parish’ in both 
counties. 
The most satisfactory results have been obtained with school gar- 
dens and with the classes for girls. This is the common experience 
in all sections of Scotland. A subinspector in Fife, commenting on 
this fact, says: 
It is not difficult to arrange practical courses for girls. Everybody sees the 
point of cookery and laundrywork—the mothers especially, and (what is no less 
important) the girls themselves. With the boys it is not so easy. The in- 
dustrial centers in Fife are not large enough for real trades schools, having a 
distinct bearing on the occupation of apprentices. Practical geometry, mensura- 
tion, and woodwork have a real bearing on many trades, but it is not so direct 
and obvious as is the case with practical work of the girls. In the mining 
centers it has been possible to organize courses that bear very directly on min- 
ing, because in these centers 9 boys out of 10 go into the pits. And this is
-P-A-G-E-395
‘RURAL UPLIFT IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. 375 
probably the secret of the comparatively greater success of the boys’ courses 
in these districts. 
The inspector for the western division of Scotland, after comment- 
ing on the success of the supplementary courses in populous in- 
dustrial centers, continues: 
It is, however, particularly gratifying to be able to state that rural districts, 
like Dumfries, Kirkcudbright, and Wagtown, are awakening to the educational 
needs of their localities in this direction. 
Special success attained by the school gardening classes, carried on 
at Kilmarnock, is attributed by the inspector to the thoroughly 
practical and stimulating instruction given by Mr. Hosking, the 
gardening expert appointed by the West of Scotland College of Agri- 
culture. This gentleman holds conferences with the teachers and 
visits the schools in which it is proposed to take up the work, and out- 
lines their methods and plans. 
Many of the school gardens were started originally for the purpose 
of nature study, and they are now turned to the service of practical 
training without loss to the earlier interest. 
The manner in which the school gardens are developed is illustrated 
by the following statement from the inspector’s report:   One of the best gardens that came under my notice was that connected with 
the central public school of Kirkmaiden, the most southerly parish in Scotland. j 
The headmaster was a pupil of Mr. Hosking, at Kilmarnock. Mr. Hosking, I 
understand, paid several visits to the garden in the course of the year, giving 
valuable guidance and stimulus. Through the intelligent sympathy of the 
chairman of the school board, everything needed in the way of tools and 
general equipment had been supplied on the most ample scale. The headmaster 
evidently entered enthusiastically into the work, and the result, as might be 
expected under these conditions, was most successful. The pupils were keenly 
interested. A knowledge of how to grow all ordinary garden vegetables and 
garden flowers had been imparted, and I am convinced that the interest excited 
and the skill acquired could not fail to react beneficially on the whole work of 
the school. Another garden meriting special attention is the one at Wallace 
hall Academy, carried on under the direct superintendence and guidance of the 
rector, Mr. Menzies. 
It may perhaps be objected that it is a somewhat narrow and limited view 
to take of the educational aims of the school garden to grow ordinary vege- 
tables and flowers, and that a wider conception of its functions should include 
experimental testing of the value of different manures on different crops—in 
short, that the school garden should be, as it were, an out-of-door agricultural 
laboratory. The one view, however, does not necessarily exclude’ the other, 
but I think it may be reasonably maintained that it would be well at the 
start to limit the educational aims of school gardening to the most familiar 
and readily learned processes of the ordinary cottage garden. As the scheme 
develops and time goes on, it will, naturally enough, embrace, in greater or 
less measure, the wider conception, and from the first, the judicious teacher 
will constantly turn it to account in connection with the nature study of the 
school. Gardening, indeed, is, in its essence, nature study of the very best type. 
The inspectors and experts interested in the practical side of rural 
supplementary courses generally agree as to the essentials for suc- 
 
-P-A-G-E-396
  3876 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
cess. Teachers, it is declared, must be specially trained for the 
work; counties must aid by maintaining staffs of itinerant teachers 
and by helping in the expense for equipments, such as garden tools, 
workshops, etc., and small parishes must be combined for the sup- 
port of supplementary courses at a common center. It is necessary, 
also, to do a great deal of missionary work to overcome the preference * 
for theoretical studies and the opposition of parish school boards to 
increased expenditures. 
RELATIONS BETWEEN SUPPLEMENTARY COURSES AND CONTINUATION CLASSES. 
The desire to preserve the unity of theschool system and to avoid 
unnecessary expense has led to efforts for utilizing supplementary 
courses as continuation classes—that is, classes intended for young 
people who have passed the age of exemption from day-school at- 
tendance (14 years) and are engaged in industrial pursuits. The 
plan of combining the continuation classes with the supplementary 
courses is encouraged by the offer of special grants from the educa- 
tion department for young people beyond the school age who attend 
the latter courses on certain afternoons of each week in the winter 
session, 
The authority conferred on school boards by the education act of 
1908 to make attendance upon continuation classes compulsory is 
being very cautiously exercised. Meanwhile, the most progressive 
boards are endeavoring by the provision of suitable instruction at 
convenient hours, by conferences with employees and associations of 
workmen, and by cooperation with other agencies, to stimulate volun- 
tary attendance upon the classes. It is specially noted in the official 
report that the first proposal of by-laws for compulsory after-school 
instruction has come from rural boards; to the school board of Hod- 
dam, Dumfriesshire, belongs the distinction of having the first pro- 
visionally approved set of by-laws under this section. Other sets are 
at present under consideration. 
The continuation classes have hitherto been most flourishing in cities 
and centers of technical industries, but under the present interest in 
rural education, plansare rapidly being formed for the provision of 
agricultural classes. In addition to short-term classes, continuation 
courses of three years’ duration have been organized in a few counties, 
which prepare pupils to enter some one of the central institutions, tech- 
nical or agricultural. These central institutions are a development 
from the provision of evening classes fostered originally by the 
science and art department in the interests of adults desirous of in- 
struction in science and in the technique of various trades. In 1900, 
when the administration of the grants for science and art passed to 
the Scotch Education Department, the policy was adopted of se- 
lecting certain institutions for the continuance of the work of the
-P-A-G-E-397
  
  
RURAL UPLIFT IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. 3T% 
evening classes. The selection in each case is made by the depart- 
ment with reference to the general standing of the institution and 
its convenient location for the purposes intended. As a condition of 
receiving the Government grants, which are made practically on the 
basis of meeting any deficiency in current expenditures, the institu- 
tions selected, on their part, submit to official supervision and in- 
spection and report annually to the department. In addition to the 
evening classes, maintained as explained, these institutions also have 
well-organized day classes in technical, scientific, and trade subjects. 
They are, in fact, developing great importance as technical institu- 
tions; the day courses of instruction are maintained at university 
standards and lead to a diploma. These institutions, to which the 
term central is applied, form thus a link between the public-school 
system and the universities, and by the arrangements above explained 
. there is the possibility that a pupil beginning with the supplementary 
course of an elementary school may make steady advance to a high 
order of scientific and technical training. 
As regards rural communities, the system in its entirety has hardly 
yet been put into operation. Even in the most progressive districts 
it has been found impossible to secure the attendance at continuation 
classes of more than 25 per cent of the youth between 14 and 18 
years of age, and the conviction is very strong that without com- 
pulsion little more can be accomplished. 
From the table of central institutions, given below, it will be seen 
that 3 only out of a total of 16 are special to agriculture; the 3, 
however, are so placed as to meet the requirements of the entire 
county.

    MEASURES FOR IMPROVING HOME LIFE IN, RURAL PARISHES, IRELAND. 
Treland presents the extreme example of an extended work in agri- 
cultural education entirely separate from the elementary schools of 
the country. This system is carried on under the auspices of the 
department of agriculture and technical instruction at Dublin, and 
its main features, as developed under the vigorous influence of Mr. 
(now Sir) Horace Plunkett, have attracted universal attention and 
have been very fully discussed in reports of this office. The effect 
has been wonderful upon the agricultural prosperity of the coun- 
try, but something more was needed to improve the home life of 
the country people. Recently efforts have been made, under the 
stimulating guidance of the department of agriculture, to sup- 
plement the work already carried on by provision for the domestic 
training of young women. The instruction of this order given in 
secondary and special schools reaches the better classes or trains 
teachers of the subject. 
ITINERANT INSTRUCTION IN DOMESTIC ECONOMY, 
In order to reach the poorer classes of young women in the coun- 
try, a system of itinerant instruction in domestic economy has been 
organized in every county of Ireland under the general plan out- 
lined as follows:* 
Short courses of instruction in cookery, laundry work, and sewing are pro- 
vided continuously throughout each session by itinerant instructresses working 
under the direction of county committees of technical instruction, such courses 
being held where technical schools or permanent classes are impossible. 
Applications are made for these courses at the commencement of the session 
by the localities in which the instruction is considered desirable. These appli- 
cations are discussed by the county committees of technical instruction, who, as 
a rule, are only able to grant a fraction of the applications. So highly is the 
instruction valued that it is no uncommon experience for a committee to receive 
a fourth or fifth application from one center. 
On the receipt of a letter from the county secretary for technical instruction, 
notifying the applicant that the services of the instructress will be at his disposal 
for the period arranged by the county committee, a local committee is formed’ 
and a local honorary secretary chosen. The details of the course as to time| 
and place having been arranged, the local secretary is supplied with suitable 
bills for distribution, announcing the date of commencement, duration, place, 
time, and scope of the course. 
Success or failure depends to a very large extent on the encourage- 
ment and help that the individual members of the committee give t 
the students. 
The manner in which this plan is carried out is illustrated by thi 
following particulars of a single itinerant course reported in th 
official journal referred to.

    This course was held at Clonaslee, a small village of 240 inhabit- 
ants, situated in Queen’s County. The industries of the village people 
are purely agricultural. 
The instruction at this center was confined to: Cookery (20 les- 
sons); home sewing and dressmaking (10 lessons). Owing to the 
paucity of suitable students, only one class a day was found to be 
necessary. The cookery lessons consisted of instruction and practice 
in preparing and cooking plain and ordinary dishes, and included 
such useful information as the management of the range, choice and 
selection of foods for meals, and the utilization of scraps; recipes for 
foods, etc., required by sick persons. The course also included simple 
instruction in hygiene, as, for example, the impurities common in 
water and “ prevention is better than cure.” 
Instruction was also given in simple household accounts and the 
use of the post-office savings bank, and five-minute lectures were given 
on such subjects as cleanliness in dairies, the cultivation of vegetables, 
etc., use being made of the leaflets issued by the agricultural branch 
of the department. 
Seventeen names had been enrolled for this class, which was held 
from 4 to 6 p. m.; an average attendance of 15 was secured. 
The course in home sewing included lessons in darning, mending, 
and patching; the construction, use, and care of the sewing machine; 
the making of patterns and cutting out. The garments made were 
chiefly such as are worn by children. Only 14 students were enrolled 
in this class, and the average attendance was about 9. 
The ages of the students varied from 14 to 30 years, the average 
being about 20 years. Ten of the students were attending for the 
first time, 5 for the second, and 2 (schoolmistresses) for the third 
time. The majority of the students were engaged during the day 
at farm work, but several housekeepers were among the most regular 
of those who attended, as also were the school teachers. 
Some of the county committees stipulate that the net cost of con- 
ducting one of these courses should not exceed £5. It is now found 
by the more experienced instructresses that the cost may be kept well 
within this limit. Judiciously made contracts with the local trades- 
men and a careful supervision of the bills of supply have done much 
to reduce the cost of these courses. The cost of the course which has 
just been described was £5 2s. ($24.78); the fees from 16 students 
and the sale of products supplied $11, or nearly half the cost. 
In other centers, where a larger population exists, it is usual to 
form two classes, one meeting from 4 to 6 p. m. and the other from 
7 to 9 p.m. The number of students admitted to each class is lim- 
ited to 20 for practical instruction, and the course consists of 30  
-P-A-G-E-400
  3890 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
When a course is completed, the instructress submits to the county 
committee a report dealing with the nature of the accommodation 
provided and the attendance of her students, and giving such infor- 
mation as is likely to be of use to the committee in forming an opinion 
of the value of the work. So far all reports have been very encourag- 
ing, both as to the interest of the people and the permanent results of 
the instruction. 
CENTRAL SCHOOLS OF HOUSEWIFERY. 
Provision for a higher order of domestic training has been made 
by the establishment of two central schools providing courses of 
instruction in housewifery, covering the entire range of domestic 
duties. The first of these schools was started some four years ago 
in the south of Ireland under the immediate direction of the nuns of 
the Ursuline Convent of Waterford. More recently the second 
school was opened in the north of Ireland at Northlands, London- 
derry, through the cooperation of the principal of the Victoria 
High School, Londonderry, a school which had already gained an 
enviable reputation for its successful instruction in domestic subjects. 
In order to realize fully the end proposed for the new institution, 
it was decided, under the advice of the principal of the Victoria 
school, to erect a building and fit it up as an ordinary dwelling 
house, where the actual conditions of home life would be daily met. 
The program of the school, which covers one year, includes, in 
addition to some literary work and the subjects which enter into the 
management of a house, a course of instruction in home hygiene and 
home nursing. The number of hours devoted each week to class 
instruction in the domestic subjects is as follows:

In addition to the practical work done during class instruction, the 
students in rotation undertake the following daily household duties: 
Cleaning of rooms and staircases, kitchen, range, and stoves. 
Preparation of kitchen and laundry for classes, marketing, etc. 
Preparation of meals. 
The course at Northlands is somewhat unique in that it combines 
the daily continuous work of a real household, including the unex- 
pected and troublesome matters which of necessity arise, with the 
formal class lessons in all household subjects. 
 
-P-A-G-E-401
RURAL UPLIFT IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. 381 
For the informal or practical management, the foundation was laid 
at the beginning of the course by the lessons in housewifery, and the 
test was given at the end by making each student responsible for a 
given time for the entire management of the house, which was fur- 
nished by the department in accordance with the advice of the prin- 
cipal of the school. 
The diploma course of Northlands is sufficiently exhaustive for a 
girl to devote her entire time to it with due regard to recreation and 
fair leisure, but it is so arranged that a student may (by leaving out 
some of the subjects of housewifery proper) pursue some subject of 
art or literature. 
_ There is also a combined course by which girls may proceed with 
their ordinary education at Victoria High School. 
The two central schools are indispensable in the general system of 
domestic training; they give importance to the work, furnish trained 
teachers to the cause, and present concrete examples of the art of 
home management. The influence of these special provisions is felt 
in the elementary schools. The number of schools giving instruction 
in cookery and laundry work steadily increases and the quality of 
the work improves. 
On this subject the commissioners of national education, in their 
latest report, say: 
       
                                                                      
    
   
   We have pleasure in reporting a very considerable increase in the number of 
schools in which courses in cookery and laundry work are taught to girls. On 
the 31st December, 1907, cookery was taught in 936 schools and Jaundry work in 
167; on the 31st December, 1908, cookery was taken in 1,596 schools and 
Jaundry work in 227. During the school year now commencing (1909-10) we 
anticipate that these numbers will be substantially increased. Since we have 
taken steps to press for the inclusion of these subjects, and particularly the 
former, in the school program, we are gratified to be able to testify to the zeal 
and energy shown by a large majority of the managers and national teachers in 
seconding our wishes. We attach very great importance to the teaching of 
cookery to girls of 11 years of age and upward. Our programs of instruction are 
carefully designed to afford a series of practical lessons of a simple character 
adapted to the means and actual circumstances of the pupils. It is not our 
aim to give an elaborate course of lessons fitted to produce finished cooks or 
domestic servants, but rather to improve the habits of living of the people by 
training the pupils in the preparation of such simple dishes as may easily be 
produced from the ordinary foodstuffs that are available. The inculcation of 
cleanliness, order, economy, and thrift also plays a leading part in our programs 
of instruction in cookery. We recognize that many of our schoolrooms are not 
well fitted for the best teaching of this kind, and whilst we admit that such 
teaching as can be provided in our schools will not be so valuable as that which 
is to be got by attending the courses of instruction given by the county in- 
structresses under the technical education committees of the several counties, 
we are satisfied that, unless some provision for the teaching of this subject be

made in our schools, the great mass of the rural population must remain in 
ignorance of this vital subject. 
THE MOVEMENT FOR AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN ENGLAND. 
As a result of the “Small Holdings and Allotments Act of 1907,” 
the educational needs of rural communities have assumed great 
economic importance in England, and the uplift of rural life and the 
improvement of agricultural processes are advocated with a zeal 
comparable to that which brought about the Elementary Education 
Act of 1870. 
PRACTICAL INSTRUCTION IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. 
The importance of early instruction in subjects pertaining to the 
home life and work of pupils, whether in city or county schools, was 
recognized by the inclusion of cookery, laundry work, dairy work, 
and cottage gardening in the code of 1882, with the offer of a special 
grant for pupils passing the required tests in the subjects. Many 
of the former school boards made extensive provision for this prac- 
tical training, and it has been carried on with great enthusiasm and 
excellent results by individual teachers. In fact, England furnishes 
admirable illustrations of the coordination, of training in these arts 
with the ordinary subjects of instruction. The president of the board 
of education, in his speech on the education estimates for the current 
year, dwelt upon several such examples, which fact, alone, indicates 
their national importance. One of the typical cases which he cited 
was that of a school in Cheshire. having 200 boys on the register, 
classified in five forms, with a head master, three trained certificated 
teachers, and one uncertificated. The school is in the country, but 
is located where it can be attended by town children. This school 
provides for the ordinary subjects, and, in addition, it has organized 
beekeeping, woodwork, gardening, and practical nature study; metal 
work and glasswork have just been introduced. The subjects of the 
general course of study, mathematics, drawing, elementary science, 
are all conducted with reference to the practical interest of the local- 
ity; for instance, to quote from the statement made to Parliament: 
Gardening is correlated with arithmetic and with English, for they have to 
write an account of all they have done, with nature study and with what is 
known as hand and eye work. Beekeeping is taught to all the boys; they re- 
gard it as very great fun, and 14 of them are known as “beekeepers.” Seed 
testing is also conducted under the same rules. When my inspector first drew 
my attention to this he said he found in the workshop there was a garden 
frame being made. They were finishing off the garden gate. One scholar had 
been making a model of a weighbridge out of his own head. A good deal of 
attention was paid to nature study and drawing, and the school garden was 
planned by themselves, containing a number of beehives. There was every 
kind of experiment work, and the boys were cooperating in making a wind

pump from their own design, pumping water out of their own well. This is a 
really intelligent school, and what is remarkable in it is that in the ordinary 
dry subjects, the A B C of elementary school work, the children are more effi- 
cient than in any of the surrounding schools. I thought the head’ master had 
done good work there. I thought he had done such good work that I might 
have him on my staff, and I appointed him two months ago. The managers of 
the school, I believe, disapprove of the appointment, but I am going to use him, 
as soon as he has learned the ordinary routine of his work, to act as a mis- 
sionary and to carry out in other parts of the country the results of his own 
experiment. 
WORK OF RURAL EDUCATION COMMITTEE. 
The present effort in regard to rural education in England has, 
however, a much broader purpose than that of imparting elementary 
notions of home and rural industries to children. It is concerned, 
more particularly, with the instruction of farmers and other persons 
engaged in agricultural pursuits, and with the improvement of agri- 
cultural processes throughout the Kingdom. It was with reference 
to these purposes that the rural education conference of 1909 was 
called, by the combined action of the County Councils Association, 
the Central Land Association, the Central Chamber of Agricul- 
ture, and the Farmers’ Club. 
Experts from other countries were invited to participate, among 
them Dr. James W. Robertson, organizer and director of the move- 
ment for rural education in Canada.* 
The conference led to the formation of a permanent committee, 
which has entered upon an exhaustive inquiry into the conditions 
bearing upon the subject. This committee has already conducted an 
investigation into the means of promoting economy in the county sys- 
tems of agricultural education by combinations of counties for the 
maintenance of directors, lecturers, etc., or by combinations between 
the county staffs and the staffs of central institutions, i. e., colleges or 
university departments of agriculture. : 
As a result of this preliminary investigation, the committee report 
the general situation in England in respect to county organization as 
follows: “ The great majority of counties have some separate staff of 
their own, and the only grouping of counties is for the purpose of - 
establishing or assisting to maintain a joint college or institute or 
(more often) arises out of association with such a center for agricul- 
tural education and research. 
“The independent staff of the county is often supplemented, and 
their work often supervised by the staff of the center with which the 
county is in association.” 
The committee express the opinion that “as a general principle 
every county either should be associated, in combination with other

counties, with an efficient center, or, if not in combination, should 
have a minimum efficient staff of its own ”; further, that “ in view of 
the difficulty of obtaining qualified teachers and organizers ” it is de- 
sirable “ to concentrate higher agricultural education, as far as possi- 
ble, in a few really efficient centers.” 
The effect of the discussions and investigations here referred to, 
covering the entire problem of rural life and industries, is plainly 
seen in the increased attention to the educational side of the problem. 
Here, also, the organization of agencies is at present the chief concern. 
SCHEME OF COUNTY ORGANIZATION. 
The board of education, in the report for 1908-9, presents the fol- 
lowing as a complete scheme of agencies for a county or a combina- 
tion of counties: 
1. Evening continuation schools for lads of 14 to 17 who have completed their 
day-school education at a public elementary school. 
2. Local classes for young farmers which meet every day for a period of two 
to six weeks, or in the evening for two hours weekly throughout the winter. 
8. Longer continuous courses for young farmers, lasting for two to six 
months, held at the county agricultural institute. 
4, Series of from four to six lectures by the county staff instructors in special 
subjects such as manures, feeding stuffs, grasses and clovers, first aid to farm 
animals, poultry keeping, horticulture, rural cooperation. 
5. Agricultural colleges serving as a rule more than one county area. 
6. Classes, with competitions, in manual processes of the farm, such as 
plowing, hedging, thatching, hurdle making, sheepshearing. 
7. Local demonstrations by the county staff in pruning, grafting, spraying, 
demonstration: plots, advice by correspondence, county bulletins describing the 
results of county experimental work, methods of combating plant pests and 
diseases, new feeding stuffs, and manures. 
The above is an ideal toward which the attention of counties is 
directed, but, in general, emphasis is placed upon one element of the 
scheme in one county and upon a different element in another, so that, 
taking the Kingdom as a whole, the work is partial and experi- 
mental. 
In his review of the situation in a statement before the House of 
* Commons, the president of the board thus touched upon the chief 
obstacle to the realization of a comprehensive scheme of rural edu- 
cation: 
The agricultural work conducted under the board in the West Riding has 
resulted in a great spread of agricultural education in the evening schools. At 
Bedford they have an excellent farm school. In Wiltshire they have an itin- 
erant instructor, or more than one, in manual farm processes. In Lindsey, 
one of the greatest of the agricultural areas, they have agricultural scholarships 
which carry their scholars right up to our universities. In Nottinghamshire 
they train elementary-school teachers in rural,subjects. All this is good work 
and is the growth of the last few years. But it is impossible that it should go 
on and be well done unless our instructors are paid good salaries. At present,
-P-A-G-E-405
  
RURAL UPLIFT IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. 385 
I am sorry to say, I find the best of the agricultural instructors, trained in the 
agricultural department at Cambridge, instead of finding employment under our 
own county councils, go out to the colonies. 
The movement for a new order of rural education as it is develop- 
ing in the English-speaking countries has a purpose far deeper than 
that of increasing the efficiency of one class of laborers; it looks to 
the entire life of communities, with emphasis on cooperative ac- 
tivity, the creation of social sympathies, community pride, and pros- 
perity; restoration, in short, of unifying and humanizing influences 
that are wanting where labor and profit strike the keynote of the 
social order. It is noticeable that while the countries of central and 
western Europe preceded the British in provision for agricultural 
training, in perfecting its methods and systematizing its agencies, 
the work is taken up de novo, as it were, in Great Britain and Ire- 
land. These countries have profited by continental experience, but 
do not blindly follow the same course. This fact emphasizes the rela- 
tion that the educational effort bears to all the conditions—climatic, 
social, and commercial—affecting the industry itself. Above all, 
it emphasizes the relation of the movement to that local independence 
which makes public opinion the sustaining force of every cause in 
Great Britain. At that point English policy is identical with that 
of the United States, and English experience is therefore full of 
suggestion to legislators and educational authorities in this country. 
SUGGESTIVE LESSONS FROM OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. 
The countries of central and western Europe have all made abun- 
dant provision for the special training of agriculturists and teachers 
of agriculture, both as regards theory and practice. Further, the 
official courses of study for elementary schools, though uniform in 
respect to essential branches, comprise also subjects selected for their 
local adaptations. On account, however, of wide differences in 
political and social conditions, the organized systems of education 
and the auxiliary agencies by which popular instruction is reenforced 
in these countries do not offer to America models for imitation, but 
simply fruitful suggestions.     
   
       
   
    TRAINING OF SPECIAL TEACHERS IN GERMANY. 
In Germany the training of teachers is a fundamental requirement 
for every order of instruction, and the teacher of any practical 
branch must add to professional training experience in the art be- 
fore he can secure recognition. The staff of itinerant lecturers mam- 
tained by the agricultural department in the interests of the farmers 
must add to the usual qualifications ability as popular speakers and 
readiness in discussion. The official regulations in regard to the 
13144°—np 1911—vo, 1——25
-P-A-G-E-406
    386 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
preparation of teachers of agriculture in the schools devoted to that 
specialty are very explicit, and there are in Prussia two well-known 
pedagogical seminaries for training teachers for this work—one at 
Hildesheim and the other at Weilburg. The latest official regulations 
on the subject provide that after April 1, 1911, no one shall be ap- 
pointed as professor of agriculture, even in the elementary schools of 
agriculture subventioned by the State, unless he possesses certificates 
proving (1) that he has at least the general education required for 
those who are admitted to the military service of one year; (2) that 
he has had four years of practical work in agriculture under proper 
supervision; (3) that he has pursued for three years the higher 
course in agricultural studies in a university or in a higher technical 
school, and that he has passed the examination for a professor of 
agriculture; (4) that he has successfully followed a professional 
course in a normal school.t 
ITINERANT HOUSEKEEPING SCHOOLS IN PRUSSIA. 
There is in Germany, as elsewhere, a rural-upiift movement at 
the present time, supported largely by women’s clubs. Through 
the instrumentality of these associations itinerant or peripatetic 
housekeeping schools have been maintained for the service of rural 
communities with occasional aid from public funds. In Prussia 
the Government is now taking an active interest in the work, for 
which, according to consular advices, a subsidy will probably be 
included in the next budget. 
ORGANIZED SYSTEM OF AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN FRANCE. 
The system of agricultural education in France has been care- 
fully organized in elementary schools and in normal schools, ac- 
cording to the provisions of the law of March 28, 1882, and many 
higher primary and modern secondary schools include a special sec- 
tion of agriculture. Apart from the provision for this branch as an 
integral part of general education, France is abundantly supplied with 
special schools of agriculture—schools that are models of organiza- 
tion, equipment, and method—and, as elsewhere noted in this report, 
the reorganized universities are zealously turning their resources 
to the service of agriculture. Notwithstanding this record bitter 
complaint is made that these elaborate provisions have failed to 
stop the exodus of young men from the farms under the alluring 
temptations of city life.

DISTINCTION BETWEEN AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION AND RURAL UPLIFT. 
The experience of France emphasizes the distinction between the 
development of agriculture and the uplift of rural life. For the 
former purpose two conditions are essential: Provision for special- 
ized training and provision for scientific instruction and research. 
Both conditions are fully supplied in France; the first, by the 
regional schools of agriculture, which rank with the secondary schools 
of commerce and of arts and trades; the second, by the university 
laboratories and experimental stations. It is admitted that the 
teaching of agriculture in the elementary schools has proved of little 
advantage. The general inspector of the branch, M. Leblanc, com- 
plains that the lesson is too often a mere memoriter repetition of 
principles and rules; occasionally a teacher is found who turns the 
plot of ground belonging to the school or to the teacher’s house into 
a garden for practical instruction and experimentation. Various 
causes are assigned for this unsatisfactory condition, such as the 
crowded programs and the brief period of school life, evils which 
can only be overcome by prolonging the ordinary period of school 
attendance. The law of January 11, 1910, raised the minimum 
age at which pupils may enter the examination for the certificate 
of primary studies from 11 to 12 years, and a bill is pending 
which provides for compulsory attendance upon continuation classes. 
A complete revision of the practical studies in the elementary pro- 
gram would be possible should this bill become law. 
MOVEMENT FOR POPULAR ENLIGHTENMENT. 
It is noticeable, however, that the great movement for the uplift 
of rural life in France is not directed to the work of elementary 
schools, but toward provision for the instruction, enlightenment, and 
social improvement of the adult population. Under the name of 
@uvres post scolaire this movement has assumed large proportions 
and definite direction throughout France. University professors 
and elementary teachers are united in the work which is fostered 
by Government and communal appropriations as well as by private 
subscriptions. Courses of instruction, illustrated lectures, dramatic 
representations, social reunions, and circulating libraries are all 
brought to the service of the cause. The Government agency for 
this work, the Musée pédagogique, in 1910 distributed 31,679 series 
of slides for the illustration of popular lectures, scientific, historic, 
etc. The same year the experiment of circulating libraries was 
attempted in seven cantons comprised in three departments. The 
number of volumes loaned was 3,000, and. these were distributed 
mainly by the agency of teachers who volunteered for the work. In 
fact, the school is the center of the effort in every commune or dis- 
 
-P-A-G-E-408
  388 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
trict, and the school teacher, who knows every family in the district, 
its indispensable agent. 
The movement for popular enlightenment in France is carried on 
alike in cities and in rural communities, and by its universality helps 
to break down distinctions between the two and to create a sense of 
national unity and common civic interests. At the same time care 
is taken to adapt the lectures, the lessons, and the books selected 
for circulation to those distinctive conditions that grow out of the 
prevailing industry. This is especially noticeable in the choice of 
subjects for scientific lectures and in the courses of instruction 
planned for regular continuation classes; it is in these divisions of 
the work that the cooperation of the professors of secondary schools 
(the local colleges and the State lycées) is most valuable. Through 
the efforts of these professors, all of whom are university graduates, 
the latest discoveries and the best scientific knowledge bearing upon 
agricultural processes are brought to the attention of small holders 
and farm agents, and thus an interest is awakened in the improve- 
ment of agriculture, as well as in the economic importance of the 
industry. The effect is seen in the increased attendance upon schools 
of agriculture and the growing tendency to appropriate local funds 
for the maintenance of laboratories and experiment stations as ad- 
juncts of the provincial universities. 
Thus, France is reaching a fundamental principle of rural de- 
velopment. It involves all the elements of community life—intellec- 
tual, industrial, and social—and in this movement the elementary 
school is important, not because of the meager knowledge that can 
be acquired there, but as a center of parental hopes and community 
interests.

CHAPTER XI. 
TRAINING OF VOCATIONAL TEACHERS IN GERMANY. 
By Epwin G. Cooney. 
INTRODUCTION. 
This article describes the training given to teachers of German 
vocational schools of middle and lower rank, including the con- 
tinuation schools and the various special trade schools, the building 
and machine trades, the industrial arts, the commercial schools, 
and vocational schools for women. No mention is made of the 
training of teachers for the highest class of vocational schools, as 
there is no proposal for the training of such teachers. Selection in 
these cases is made directly on the basis of scholarship and person- 
ality, qualities that are invaluable in all grades of teachers. When, 
however, schools and teachers become numerous, teachers must 
be employed who are not to the manner born; who are not especially 
distinguished by profound scholarship or strong personality, but 
who must be trained. 
In the beginning of any movement for a new class of schools 
trained teachers are lacking, and positions in such schools are quite 
commonly filled by persons with more enthusiasm than knowledge 
of the business, as well as by inefficient persons from other occupa- 
tions who seek an asylum in the public-school service. In Germany, 
as in other countries beginning to install vocational schools, the 
instructors have been largely part-time teachers from other schools, 
or from industrial. vocations, to whom the vocational teaching 
has been a side issue. This is almost invariably the case in America, 
where our evening schools are taught either by elementary and 
secondary day-school teachers or by persons struggling to gain 
professional standing in some other field. In some cities, as in 
Chicago, would-be lawyers, doctors, etc., are no longer eligible to 
positions, but these positions are reserved for trained teachers. 
This, however, is only the first step. These professional teachers 
should be technically trained as well for the vocations followed by 
their pupils and employed for full time in the continuation-school 
work. Under no other condition can we secure the esprit de corps so 
necessary to the complete success of a system of schools. 
389  
-P-A-G-E-410
  890 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
In Germany great emphasis is laid, and in my opinion rightly, on 
what they call ‘‘corporate [or school] spirit’’—the feeling that one’s 
school is an independent and important organism, worth while for its 
own sake, and not merely an appendage to something else. Accord- 
ingly there is now a general movement toward organizing vocational 
schools on an independent basis with their own corps of teachers, their 
own special school buildings, and, finally, their own arrangements for 
training teachers for this class of work. 
The standard for such teachers is constantly rising in Germany, 
and at the present time the teaching of vocational subjects there has 
been elevated to the dignity of a profession, demanding thorough 
- preparation, general and special. The situation is different in differ- 
ent parts of Germany, the south German States being distinctly in 
advance of their northern neighbors. Everywhere, however, it will 
be found that people are discussing the question of securing better 
trained and more efficient teachers for the vocational schools. 
VOCATIONAL SCHOOLS IN PRUSSIA. 
The vocational schools, except the technical high schools, in 
Prussia are under the management of the Ministry of Commerce and 
Industry. For a number of years the Prussian authorities have 
been struggling with the question of training vocational teachers 
for the continuation and middle schools. The measures they have 
taken, with the exception of those for training teachers for women’s 
work, seem to me fragmentary and insuflicient. They are interesting, 
however, to Americans who are just beginning to think about the 
problem, and may furnish helpful suggestions as to first ways of 
meeting emergencies. The fundamental need in Prussia was to 
induce persons to accept teaching positions who were trained in the 
theory of their subjects and familiar also with the practical side of 
industrial life. In the first instance such persons were very rare, 
and it became necessary to make provision for having teachers 
adequately prepared. The Government has endeavored to fix the 
standards for this preparation, as well as to provide for the internal 
management of training schools. 
In 1885 only a few teachers in the vocational schools of Prussia 
could lay claim to a pension. Their average salary was very small, 
and their social position was inferior to that of teachers in other 
schools. The Prussian Government has endeavored to change this, 
and to-day not only are the salaries of the principals and teachers of 
the schools paid wholly by the State but the city vocational-school 
teachers are appointed for life, with the right to a pension for them- 
selves as well as for their widows and orphans. Those teachers of 
the State‘vocational schools who have a university education receive 
also a dwelling or a cash compensation for rent. While the salaries
-P-A-G-E-411
  TRAINING OF VOCATIONAL TEACHERS IN GERMANY. 391 
are smaller than those paid in America, they approximate those given 
in the best academic institutions of Prussia. The Prussian Govern- 
ment has also undertaken to award titles and official positions to 
teachers in vocational schools, especially to teachers of State insti- 
tutions of this kind. The effect of these two regulations is to make 
it easier to induce a high class of persons to undertake the training 
necessary for successful service in the vocational schools. 
The difficulty, however, in Prussia has been only partly overcome. 
The training of vocational teachers for girls’ industrial schools seems 
to have advanced the most. The steady progress of the movement 
for the emancipation of women in Germany and the increasing diffi- 
culty of preparing them for self-support under modern social condi- 
tions have finally induced the Prussian Government to make systematic 
arrangements for the training of women for work. In January, 1907, 
it was decreed that a normal department should be established in 
connection with every school of domestic science subsidized by the 
State. The decree also prescribed the course of study in the depart- 
ment. A detailed account of this organization will be given later. 
In the Prussian schools for the building trades and schools of 
mechanical engineering, no special arrangement for the preparation of 
teachers has been made so far. There is no institution in Prussia for 
training such teachers, and, as far as I know, no system of examina- 
tions to test whether. applicants have the requisite knowledge and 
skill. It seems to be quite the fashion to employ in such schools 
graduates of higher technical institutes who have seen successful 
service in the industries and have an interest in teaching. Very few 
of the ordinary academic teachers are to be found in these schools, 
even as teachers of the academic subjects. In the effort. to keep in 
touch with modern industrial conditions the school authorities have 
almost invariably selected practical men from the industries as 
teachers. As a further measure for securing this close relation with 
industrial life many of these men have been encouraged to devote a 
part of their time to work in the industries. This is in striking con- 
trast to the regulations of many school boards in America, which 
penalize any teacher who endeavors to engage in practical work outside 
of the schoolroom. 
It must not be assumed that the Prussian authorities utterly neglect 
the matter of industrial training for this class of teachers. As already 
stated, such teachers are required to have an advanced education 
obtained in the university and the technical school, and especially 
to have had adequate experience in industrial life. Additional 
opportunities are given for the professional education of such teachers 
by means of visits to other cities, leaves of absence (with pay) for 
further study, and permission to engage in private occupations along 
the general lines of their teaching activities. The younger teachers
-P-A-G-E-412
392 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
are also encouraged to employ their summer vacations in further 
special preparation. 
The Prussian Government is especially concerned about the train- 
ing of teachers for the industrial art schools. Such teachers must 
keep in touch with the progress of art; for example, by becoming 
familiar with new fields of activity in industrial design. Courses of 
instruction have been arranged for teachers in different fields of 
industrial art during the last few years. As for instance, the courses 
given by Architect Riermerschmidt, of Munich, dealing with designs 
for furniture and interior architecture; courses in flat ornamentation 
at the Industrial Art and Trade School of Magdeburg; in lettering in 
the school of design at Dusseldorf under Prof. Behrens; in mura] 
painting and decorating for teachers of technical schools under the 
direction of Prof. Mohrbutter, at Charlottenburg; and finally a course 
in mural decoration under Prof. Hammel, at Hanover. Mention 
may also be made of courses in plant designs in 1901-2 and in 1909, 
conducted by Prof. Meurer at Rome and Berlin, which were attended 
by 50 Prussian teachers and directors. Such teachers are assisted 
by grants given by the State or municipality for teachers’ study 
journeys. Similar journeys are encouraged by grants to teachers of 
the textile branches. 
TRAINING FOR TEACHERS OF CONTINUATION SCHOOLS. 
The professional preparation of teachers for continuation schools 
is more urgent and more important than for schools of any other class. 
In earlier times these schools were generally intrusted to teachers of 
elementary schools, who were seldom sufficiently prepared to give 
the proper instruction. It has been found necessary to give special 
training to all teachers employed in the continuation schools, and 
very thorough training to those employed to teach drawing and 
technology. When the whole continuation school system of Prussia 
was transferred to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry 25 years 
ago, efforts were at once made to provide for the training of teachers 
for continuation schools. During the years from 1886 to 1894 
professional drawing courses were given at Berlin, Dusseldorf, and 
Hannover, where the sum of $2,284 was set aside annually for these 
courses. About 400 teachers had the benefit of the training. In 
consequence of the steadily increasing number of continuation schools, 
the number of courses in drawing increased; and courses in com- 
mercial subjects, language, and arithmetic were added. In 1905 the 
sum applied to this purpose amounted to $30,940, and in 1909 to 
$47,600. The number of teachers employed in the continuation 
schools in 1904 was 11,517, of whom 549 were employed in day con- 
tinuation schools and, therefore, were compelled to sever their 
connection with the elementary schools. The number of such day 
 
-P-A-G-E-413
  TRAINING OF VOCATIONAL TEACHERS IN GERMANY. 393 
continuation schools is rapidly increasing, and with it the necessity 
of making larger provision for the preparation of teachers for this 
work. The Prussian Government recognizes this necessity fully and 
also the scope of the preparation which should include both pedagog- 
ical and technical training, completed by industrial experience, but 
the Government is still struggling with the problem, and, so far as the 
writer can see, has not worked out a thorough system for meeting 
~ the demands of the present-day vocational or continuation school. 
TRAINING OF VOCATIONAL TEACHERS FOR GIRLS’ SCHOOLS. 
As has been pointed out, this class of vocational schools is in 
better condition, so far as the training of teachers is concerned, 
than the other vocational schools of Prussia. Since 1907 the Gov- 
ernment has endeavored to deal directly and adequately with the 
problem. In this connection the following details are of interest: 
There are three groups of teachers for vocational work for women 
in Prussia: (1) Teachers of women’s handiwork; (2) teachers of 
household arts; (3) vocational teachers for the industries. Careful 
provision is made for training teachers of each of these classes. 
Teachers of the first group are specially prepared for the work of 
teaching children in elementary, middle, and higher schools to do 
some handiwork, such as knitting, crocheting, sewing, and embroid- 
ery. Teachers of the second group are trained to give instruction 
in school kitchens of the elementary schools where cooking and ordi- 
nary housework are taught. Teachers of the third class are pre- 
pared to teach older girls in the special continuation schools the 
finer handiwork required in tailoring, dressmaking, and millinery. 
It has been usual, but not universal, for the vocational teacher of 
the industry to qualify first as a teacher of women’s handiwork and 
household arts and then build upon this for the higher position of a 
teacher of an industry. 
At first vocational teachers were trained in private schools. Since 
1890 three State schools for girls have been founded, one at Posen, 
one at Rheydt, and a third at Potsdam. One of the main purposes 
of these State schools is the preparation of women teachers of voca- 
tional work. These teachers are required to have a thorough train- 
ing in several special subjects, based upon the general education 
given in a fully developed higher girls’ school or girls’ middle school 
of Prussia or equivalent education. After this comes the mastery 
of the technique of women’s handiwork in special vocational schools. 
The course of study for the teachers of women’s handiwork is a good 
preparation for the training of teachers for schools of special indus- 
tries. Such teachers in the future must have a year’s practice in 
handiwork and household arts as a preliminary in order that they
-P-A-G-E-414
  394 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
may not be inferior in their technical knowledge and dexterity to 
the ordinary teacher of these branches. 
The decree for the training of industrial teachers issued in January, 
1907, provides that industrial teachers must not only attend an 
institution for the training of such teachers, but must also serve at 
least a half year in actual industrial life and a probationary year in 
teaching before receiving the certificate of an industrial teacher. 
The knowledge provided by the theoretical training is not considered 
sufficient. This must be supplemented by practical application of 
the theory in the industries themselves, which no school training 
can replace. Finally, the training in methods of instruction can be 
successfully pursued only when a candidate is both trained in theory 
and has had experience in the industry itself. To sum up, the 
entire training consists of three stages: Theoretical instruction in 
the training school, practical experience in the industry, and pro- 
bationary teaching. 
The Government permits the experience in the industries to be 
gained either before or after attendance at the training school. On 
the contrary, the probationary year must follow the instruction in 
the school, and in no case can the probationary year be used for 
ordinary teaching; it must be reserved for the vocational training 
of the young teacher. For this reason only a small number of pro- 
bationary students are sent to any one school. 
Several different kinds of certificates are given to teachers, depend- 
ing upon the specialty they select. As has been stated, an industrial 
teacher is qualified to teach a class in handiwork or in household arts, 
A teacher of millinery must be able to give instruction in other voca- 
tional subjects. In order to accustom themselves to the various 
types and sizes of schools, every teacher must be able to handle more 
than one vocational subject. 
The ministry exercises great care in the admission to the training 
school of candidates from middle schools. Only schools of equal 
grade with the higher-grade schools are accepted. 
The policy of basing the training of industrial teachers upon the 
training of teachers of handiwork and household arts has given rise 
to many questions. There is some doubt as to whether such candi- 
dates should be required to pass the examination of teacher of handi- 
work and household arts before entering upon the advanced courses. 
It seemed to many that the time taken in preparation for such exami- 
nations could be better employed for further training. On the other 
hand, some girls might be able to pass the first examination who 
would fail in the second and would therefore be required to give up 
study before the completion of their training. If they had passed 
the first examination, all would not be lost, as they could teach handi- 
work and household arts in the elementary or higher girls’ school.
-P-A-G-E-415
    
TRAINING OF VOCATIONAL TEACHERS IN GERMANY. 395 
The interests of the girls themselves then seemed to demand that 
they be required to take the first examination before entering upon 
the advanced courses. 
Admission into the seminary (or training school) for industrial 
teachers requires not only the passing of an examination as teacher 
of household arts and women’s handiwork, but also that prepara- 
tion be made in a women’s institute, approved by the Ministry of 
Commerce and Industry. The school conducted by the Lette 
Verein is permitted to prepare teachers for everything except draw- 
ing. The Pestalozzi-Froebel House trains teachers for cooking and 
household arts. The Victoria School in Berlin trains teachers for 
dressmaking and millinery. 
The three State institutions at Posen, Rheydt, and Potsdam all 
undertake the training of teachers for women’s vocational work. 
Each of these three schools has four divisions: A school of house- 
hold arts, an industrial school, a commercial school, and a seminary 
for training teachers. Everyone is urged to take the course in house- 
hold arts, which includes an outline of all that a good housekeeper 
must know. The students receive instruction in cleaning and other 
household tasks, cooking, baking, sewing, mending, science of nour- 
ishment, care of children, and care of the sick. Special optional 
courses are given, such as courses for continuation school work and 
simple handiwork, dressmaking, sewing, millinery, drawing and paint- 
ing, cooking, baking, washing and ironing. It is proposed to add 
also a training course in kindergarten work. 
The hour plan for the various teachers’ courses in these State 
schools follows:

  898 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
The Prussian plan of preparing vocational teachers is followed in 
most parts of Germany, academic teachers and men trained for the 
industries being employed in varying proportions with more or less 
special preparation for their vocational teaching. Nothing, however, 
that can be called a system exists in Prussia, or anywhere else in 
Germany outside of Munich, Wurttemberg, and Baden. Classes 
may be found suffering from instruction by a teacher who does not 
know the industries he attempts to teach, and others becoming 
demoralized under a mechanic who can not teach or govern. 
MUNICH PLAN. 
At the annual conference of the Association of Teachers in Tech- 
nical Institutions of Great Britain held in Southport, 1911, Thomas 
J. Bernett, M. A., master of method for the Edinburgh School Board, 
discussed the question Of training of teachers for the continuation 
schools. In his address he gave a translation of a communication 
he had received from Dr. Georg Kerchensteiner, director of education 
of Munich. In this communication Dr. Kerchensteiner says: 
The training of trade teachers in Germany goes on, properly speaking, in only two 
towns, Karlsruhe and Munich. In the rest of Germany trade teachers are mainly 
chosen from the certified students of the different technical day schools. Vienna has 
an excellent school for trade teachers in its Technological Industrial Museum. 
In regard to Munich in particular, the town in which trade teachers are more 
employed in continuation schools than in all Germany and Austria, we train our trade 
teachers ourselves. Every year, when need arises, we issue a notice that first-class 
men engaged in trade are wanted for the different branches of woodwork and metal 
work. As soon as applications have been received, we decide whether the candidates 
are to be admitted to the examination. The examination includes the execution of 
a piece of practical work, the drawing of the plans of that work, an estimate of the 
expense entailed, and a written description of the steps involved. If the examination 
is passed, the candidates must next practice for six months, without pay, in the work~ 
shops for instruction provided for that purpose. In the second half year he must 
continue his practice, but receives a wage of 75 cents per day. In the meantime he 
has also to complete his training by attending a course of lectures on the theory of 
education, on technology, on tool-and-machine construction. After the course of a 
year he has another examination to pass, which includes the same subjects as the first 
examination, and in addition the lectures heard in the course of the year. Besides, 
he has to stand a test of his teaching powers before a class of pupils. If this examina- 
tion is passed, he is appointed trade teacher at a salary of about $535. It may be added 
that excellent candidates come from the metal and timber industries. 
As trade teachers for other different trades we choose direct from the workshop 
men who can show very good testimonials, and we watch whether they are successful 
in teaching. At first they get but a few lessons to teach at so much per lesson; if they 
prove themselves they get more and more, and if they do very well, are then finally 
placed in a responsible position. This policy has throughout proved successful. 
In Wurttemberg and Baden the Governments have grappled with 
the problem and have evolved a method of training vocational 
teachers that can claim to be systematic and thorough. I begin with 
an account of the organization of the Wurttemberg system.
-P-A-G-E-419
    TRAINING OF VOCATIONAL TEACHERS IN GERMANY. 399 
WURTTEMBERG PLAN. 
Wurttemberg has had vocational schools of both high, middle, and 
‘lower rank for many years. The lower schools were reorganized by 
the law of July, 1906, which provides for— 
(1) Placing the entire organization of such schools on a vocational 
basis; (2) special support of these schools independent of the general 
system; (3) compulsory attendance between the ages of 14 and 18; 
(4) time and duration of instruction given to apprentices; (5) train- 
ing of teachers and inspection of these schools; (6) obligations of 
employers with reference to these schools; (7) discipline and regular 
attendance; (8) an industrial school council to manage them. 
In the vocational schools the vocation dominates not only the course 
of study, but also the entire organization and administration, includ- 
ing the special training of the teachers. The law prescribes three 
successive years of instruction in continuation schools for apprentices 
between the ages of 14 and 18, paralleling the years of apprenticeship. 
Within these limits the school is to be organized in the way that seems 
best adapted to secure training for the vocation. 
The vocational school works under difficulties, greater compara- 
tively than those of the elementary school. The pupils of the ele- 
mentary school are all prepared in the same general way, and advance 
through successive grades without a break. In the vocational school 
the pupils are not all trained in the same way nor to the same degree, 
many of them having left the elementary school after finishing the 
fifth, sixth, or seventh grade, and 80 per cent of them before complet- 
ing the entire eight grades. The vocational school must, therefore, 
build upon the somewhat narrow basis of experience, must deepen 
and widen this experience, and develop a habit of thought that will 
extend beyond immediate observation, and aim at the understanding 
of both the ‘‘how” and ‘‘why”’ of the practice in the vocation. The 
teacher is compelled to give up the ordinary notion of progress 
through the various subjects, and must constantly repeat his instruc- 
tion in the essentials with an ever wider application to the experience 
gained in vocational life. In other words he must employ what used 
to be called in America ‘‘the spiral method.” : 
In the vocational school, correlation of subjects is especially impor- 
tant. The subjects of instruction must grow out of each other. 
Industrial work and a certain amount of commercial work must be 
taken together. Technical instruction must be given in the closest 
connection with everything else in the course. All the work of the 
chool is related to the vocation and tested by its usefulness in the 
ocation. In most cases this close correlation among all the subjects 
iven in the school can be best secured by having teachers each of 
hom can teach all the compulsory subjects of the general division 
       
                           
    
       
   
-P-A-G-E-420
   
       400 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
to which he is assigned. Four divisions are recognized in the Wurt- 
temberg plan: The machine trades division, the building trades 
division, the industrial arts division, and the commercial division. 
Every teacher must be prepared to teach all the subjects included in 
one of these divisions. Such an arrangement is inevitable in all but 
the largest places, but in any event is best suited to securing the corre- 
lation of subjects necessary in a vocational school. The organization 
for the large places only might be different, but there are advantages 
in having all of the vocational schools organized on one general plan. 
The vocational teacher must therefore possess a wide and extended 
training in technology, commerce, industrial art, and pedagogy. 
Such teachers, engaged all the time in their own divisions, can do 
more to build up an esprit de corps than any number of teachers of 
special subjects. ’ 
The effort to secure teachers by the ordinary methods of advertis- 
ing and examination has failed. Teachers must be trained for this 
special task. Now, the two classes of persons who can be trained are 
the experienced academic teacher and the trained technical man from 
the industries. Of the two, the academic teacher lacks technical and 
business knowledge and must be trained technically and commerci- 
ally; the technical man has technical knowledge, but must gain power 
of control and skill in presentation. Every well-organized school 
should have representatives of both classes. Only those who have 
mastered one of the vocational groups technically, commercially, 
and pedagogically are permitted to teach in a vocational school in — 
Wurttemberg. 
Briefly then, the work of the vocational schools may be divided 
into four groups: (1) The machine trades group, (2) the building 
trades group, (3) the industrial arts group, (4) the commercial group. 
The Wurttemberg plan provides for the training of technical teachers, 
thoroughly equipped in some one of the four main groups and in the 
rudiments of business theory and methods of instruction. The 
employment of teachers whose technical knowledge is limited to one 
of these groups, or a part of it would be possible only in the largest 
schools, and their employment even there would be bad for the school 
system. 
In small places, where perhaps only a single vocational teacher is 
employed, that one should be thoroughly trained in the leading 
industry of the locality; and he must know in addition the rudiments 
of other trades or vocations if he is to perform his function fully. In 
larger places some division of labor among the teachers is possible. 
In Feunbach, a suburb of Stuttgart, with about 13,000 inhabitants, 
- the writer visited a vocational day school with two divisions, one for 
the building trades group and one for the machine trades group. 
One of the teachers had been trained in the building trades school at
-P-A-G-E-421
  TRAINING OF VOCATIONAL TEACHERS IN GERMANY. 401 
Karlsruhe and one in the machine trades courses at Stuttgart,» 
described later in this’article. In still larger places visited, the divi- 
sion of labor among the teachers was carried much further. In one 
instance a teacher was caring for a division consisting of printer’s 
apprentives only. In each case the division of labor did not extend 
within the main group of subjects, but one teacher was required to 
care for his entire division, and often was promoted with it at the end 
of the year. Part-time teachers were employed usually to teach the 
optional subjects only, full-time teachers caring for the compulsory 
ones. Such teachers of optional subjects are not included in the gen- 
eral scheme for training teachers, but take short special courses of 
from two to six weeks’ duration. 
The full-time vocational teachers of Wurttemberg are trained in 
extended courses maintained in special schools for training teachers of 
this class of work. The teachers who specialize in the building 
trades are now sent to Karlsruhe in Baden, the best school for voca- 
tional teachers in Germany. Here they take a course of three and 
one-half years. The students in this course are drawn from the class 
of experienced and efficient elementary and secondary teachers, who 
have already had the pedagogical training of the teacher’s training 
school. They have been through at least six years of a secondary 
school before going to the training school, so that they are well 
grounded in ordinary cultural subjects. Wurttemberg grants them 
an allowance of $240 per year while they are at Karlsruhe. After 
finishing the course there, they are required to spend from six months 
to a year in actual shop practice in the industries. In 1907 there were 
some 40 or 50 candidates from Wurttemberg in the Karlsruhe train- 
ing school; the course of this school will be described in the discus- 
sion of the subject for Baden. 
The teachers for the commercial continuation schools of Wurttem- 
berg are sent to commercial high schools where special courses for 
training such teachers are provided. Leipzig, Mannheim, Cologne, 
Berlin, and other cities have similar courses, the one at Leipzig being 
especially good for this purpose. Besides this, preparatory courses of 
one and one-half years’ duration were established in Stuttgart in 
1907. Candidates for such courses are selected from elementary and 
secondary teachers of exceptional ability. 
Similar provisions are made for candidates for positions in the 
industrial arts group of trades, who are usually sent for their training 
to an industrial arts school, such as the one at Stuttgart or at Munich. 
The selection of so many elementary teachers for these courses is, 
for the most part, based on reasons of expediency. Skilled technical 
and business men are equally desirable, but harder to get. In fact, 
most authorities regard them as better material for teachers of voca- 
13144°—xp 1911—vo1n 1——26  
-P-A-G-E-422
    
402 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
tions. It is, however, difficult to attract efficient architects and engi- 
neers to the teaching profession, while it is dangerous, as we know in 
America, to employ men from the industries who have been misfits 
in a profession and who seek an asylum in the industrial school serv- 
ice. Wurttemberg is, however, finding it necessary to train some 
men from the industries for its service, and has organized special 
courses for the purpose. 
Candidates admitted to the courses must have had the training of 
an industrial school of middle or higher rank and successful experi- 
ence in their profession, but for the special course they receive no 
scholarship allowance, as many are likely to fail to meet the demands 
of the new profession. 
On account of the demand for vocational teachers it has been 
urged that such practical men be allowed to teach their own special- 
ties without much preparatory training, at least in the larger cities, 
where it would be possible to find places for men who can teach only 
one subject. This proposition has been rejected for several reasons: 
It would prevent the formation of an institutional interest and pride 
in the vocational school, a general interest in training boys rather 
than in teaching subjects. It would destroy esprit de corps in the 
teaching force by filling the most important positions (those in the 
larger cities) with teachers of the least special preparation, and thus 
lead to indifference on the part of better-trained teachers whose 
opportunity for advancement would be cut off. Merit would cease 
to rule, and lack of training would bring special privileges. Wurt- 
temberg preferred to wait, and frowned upon all attempts to organize 
industrial schools before properly trained teachers could be provided. 
The law of 1906 was, therefore, to be put into operation in 1909, after 
teachers had been trained, special buildings erected, and a complete 
organization perfected. This is not the American system, where in 
our haste to reach the end we are apt to overlook the means necessary 
for success. The requirements for students at the Karlsruhe training 
school have been adopted for the training courses for technical men 
at Stuttgart. 
Mastery of the subject matter is not a sufficient preparation for 
teaching it. Highly trained technical men often fail when put before 
aclass. While the Wurttemberg school takes all possible care to make 
sure that the teacher knows his subject, it also insists upon a training 
in theory and in the practice of classroom work. The teacher must 
be taught how to use his material, how to sift out essentials and treat 
them in a systematic way, and how to handle a class, secure attention, 
and preserve discipline. 
The lecture method is not employed in these courses, except in a 
very few subjects, the seminary method being the favorite one. 
Observation of good teaching in vocational schools is one of the
-P-A-G-E-423
  TRAINING OF VOCATIONAL TEACHERS IN GERMANY. 403 
features, and students make excursions to the best industrial schools 
of Baden to observe the work done there. Characteristic problems 
are worked out in the seminar and students are encouraged to attack 
similar problems themselves. The seminar attempts careful treat- 
ment of the subjects of the ‘‘question”’ and the “explanation.” 
The instruction is not, however, limited to mere matters of detail, 
but goes into the general theory of education, with a historical sur- 
vey of its development and of its leading representatives. Special 
divisions of the general subject are given thorough treatment. The 
technical man is shown the interworking of social science and peda- 
gogy and the necessity of a knowledge of methods of instruction. He 
is made to feel the responsibility of the teacher and encouraged to 
make a wider research into the educational questions of the time. 
The course for such technical men is shown by the following general 
requirements and programs: 
1. The course is one and a quarter years in length, of which one 
year is devoted to the study of pedgogical questions and three months 
to a review before the service examination. Those who pass the 
examination are immediately assigned to temporary work in the 
schools. 
2. The number of participants in each course is 20. This allows 
for the dropping out of some before the end of the course. 
There was at first some disposition to lighten these requirements in 
view of the great demand for vocational teachers. The authorities, 
keeping in mind the importance of the function these teachers. per- 
formed, decided not to place the minimum too low. The vocational 
teachers must form a contingent of the public service equal in rank 
to the general body of officials if these schools are not to lose the 
confidence of the people. This is important in view of the prominent 
position accorded to the German teacher. The vocational teacher 
must be the equal of the academic teacher in culture, salary, and pro- 
fessional ability if the vocational schools are to sustain themselves. 
High demands as to general culture are made upon the vocational 
teacher. They teach business and cultural subjects as well as tech- 
nology, and therefore must possess the general training indicated by 
the completion of the first six classes in a secondary school. 
Along technical lines these technical men must have had training 
equivalent to that required of an architect for the State master 
builder’s certificate, or, in the case of the mechanical engineer, to that 
required for the diploma examination. In the case of an industrial 
art teacher he must show the qualifications necessary for the drawing 
teacher’s examination. Technical men who wish to become voca- 
tional teachers and who have passed none of these examinations must 
prove their technical qualifications by a preliminary examination.

404 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
The course requires 36 hours per week, which is less than the time 
required at Karlsruhe, where technical students spend an average of 
45 hours a week and commercial students 28 hours a week. More can 
be exacted of the technical men than of the commercial students, 
because a large part of the time in the former courses is employed in 
drawing and in practice, which do not require so much work.

  It is apparent that the above course is planned for mechanical 
engineers who are preparing to become vocational teachers. For this 
reason, a comparatively short time is given to technical instruction 
in engineering, as it would offer nothing new for the candidate. If 
men from the building trades or industrial art trades enter these 
courses, the number of hours in 12 C 6 or ¢ can be reduced in favor of 
more work in the mechanical engineering subjects. If the technical 
man is especially qualified in one division, he can give special atten- 
tion to some other in his vocational course. 
The management and supervision of the course is in the hands of 
the Royal Industrial Council. ‘Teaching halls are opened in localities 
requiring a course of this sort. Such halls are well lighted, provided 
with the necessary equipment, and with drawing rooms and labora- 
tories. As instruction in technique and drawing demands the use of 
material which exists only in special technical institutions, it is  
-P-A-G-E-425
    
TRAINING OF VOCATIONAL TEACHERS IN GERMANY. 405 
expected that courses will be offered in the Royal Building Trades 
School of Stuttgart, and that the teachers of this institution will 
be avilable to conduct them. 
As already stated, it has not seemed wise to make State grants to 
technical men carrying on studies to prepare for work as teachers in 
vocational schools. The situation is not the same as with the teachers 
studying in Karlsruhe. The Karlsruhe candidates are already in the 
State teaching service, and are on a leave of absence for advanced 
work. The State support is only a partial compensation for their loss 
of salary. These teachers have already proved their qualifications in 
work for the State, and it is reasonably sure that they will be suc- 
cessful in their new school work at Karlsruhe. They have already 
demonstrated their ability in the classroom. With the technical man 
the case is different. He is required to change his calling, and enter 
into a profession, not knowing whether he will ‘make good” or not. 
No one can guarantee that a State scholarship awarded to such per- 
sons will be a good investment. It seems, therefore, not to be wise 
to encourage such men to enter the profession by a money scholar- 
ship, except in the special case of unusually capable men who have 
already demonstrated their ability in the classroom of an ordinary 
continuation school. 
TRAINING OF VOCATIONAL TEACHERS IN BADEN. 
The Grand Duchy of Baden was one of the earliest European States 
to take up the systematic training of its youth for a vocation. The 
vocational schools are well organized and the teachers are exception- 
ally well trained for their work. Baden has had, since 1882, a well- 
organized school in the city of Karlsruhe for the training of voca- 
tional teachers. For this reason, a full statement of the requirements 
for such teachers in the Grand Duchy of Baden, together with a 
transcript of the program of work carried on in the school for the 
training of vocational teachers, may be of interest and value. I 
shall omit unimportant details. 
TRAINING OF COMMERCIAL TEACHERS. 
The ordinance of 1907 with reference to the training and examina- 
tion of commercial teachers provides as follows: 
An appointment as a commercial or industrial teacher depends upon passing an 
examination which is given every year by a committee of the National Industrial 
Commission. Admission to the examination depends upon proof of— 
1. Citizenship of Baden. 2. Acceptance as a candidate for the position of teacher 
in the elementary schools or the completion of the seventh year of a secondary school. 
8. A certain amount of experience in the mercantile business, as given below. 4. At 
least two years’ attendance at an educational institution designated by the ministry 
of the interior for the training of commercial teachers.  
-P-A-G-E-426
    
406 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
Elementary school teachers must furnish evidence of practical service in a mercan- 
tile business of at least one year, and candidates who have finished the seventh year 
of a secondary school must spend two years in such service, all of which service must 
be completed before attendance at the school for training commercial teachers. 
‘The examination is divided into a written and an oral part. It covers the following 
subjects:

nation may be taken after the candidate passes the examination as a 
commercial teacher. 
 
-P-A-G-E-427
  
  TRAINING OF VOCATIONAL TEACHERS IN GERMANY. 407 
A candidate who fails may repeat the examination after the expira- 
tion of a year; if he“does not pass at the second trial he will not be 
permitted to try again. 
The fee for the examination is 20 marks, and for the further exami- 
nation on special languages, 5 marks. Upon request the fee of 
persons without means may be wholly or partly remitted. 
The ordinance contains an emergency clause to the effect that so 
long as Baden does not have a sufficient number of teachers at its 
disposal measuring up to these requirements persons may be em- 
ployed as commercial teachers who have gained the necessary 
knowledge in other ways and have proven their fitness by instruction 
in a commercial school. 
TRAINING OF INDUSTRIAL TEACHERS, 
The ordinance concerning the preparation and examination of 
teachers for industrial schools is as follows: 
Applicants for appointment as teachers in industrial schools must pass a special 
examination. This is divided into a preliminary examination and a principal exami- 
nation. The examination is held every year under the direction of a committee of the 
National Industrial Commission. Admission to the preliminary examination depends 
upon the proof of (1) citizenship of Baden; (2) acceptance as a candidate for the posi- 
tion of teacher in the elementary school or the completion of the seventh year of a 
secondary school; (3) attendance in the first three classes in the industrial teachers’ 
division of the Building Trades School of Karlsruhe. 
To be admitted to the principal examination, candidates must have passed the 
introductory examination, must have attended from the fourth to the seventh class in 
the industrial teachers’ division of the Building Trades School in Karlsruhe, and 
must bring proof of the prescribed practical experience in industrial life. This prac- 
tical experience must amount in the case of elementary teachers to at least one year 
and in case of candidates who have finished the seventh class of a middle school to at 
least two years. It must be finished before the candidate enters upon the fourth class 
in the industrial teachers’ division of the Building Trades School in Karlsruhe. The 
time spent in industrial operations, or in vacation work for the Building Trades School, 
will not be reckoned in this practical experience. A more detailed account of the 
nature of the practical work will be given later. 
The examination is divided into an oral and a written part. In the preliminary 
examination there is also a test of the teaching ability of the candidate. 
The preliminary examination covers the following subjects: (1) German compo- 
sition; (2) mathematics; (3) descriptive geometry; (4) physics; (5) chemistry; (6) 
elements of mechanics; (7) free-hand drawing and painting. 
The principal examination includes the following: 
I. For the building trades department: (1) Theory and design of building construc- 
tion in stone, wood, and iron; (2) elements of the theory of mechanics. 
II. For the machine trades department: (1) Theory of mechanics; (2) elements of 
electrotechnology; (3) elements of the theory of building construction. 
Ill. For both architectural and machine trades department: (1) Grammar of form

It is recommended that voluntary work be done in one of the 
following trades: Stonecutting, glazing, plumbing, paper hanging, 
electrowork, lithographing, bookbinding. It is not expected that 
candidates will acquire great mechanical dexterity by means of this 
practical activity in industrial life, but it is hoped that a clear and 
comprehensive survey of the whole industrial field can be made, 
and attention be paid to the different processes of work. During 
the time of practical work in the industry, which is included in the 
preparation for the profession of industrial teacher, it is especially 
important that the candidates comply exactly with the same methods 
of business and times of work as the ordinary worker in the industry. 
At the close of this work the candidate must present a certificate 
from the manager of the business in which he has been engaged. In 
some cases State support will be granted to facilitate this training 
in the industries. 
A certain amount of vacation employment is demanded of students 
in the Karlsruhe school, although this is not reckoned as practical 
experience in the industries. This vacation employment includes—

The director of the school prescribes the kind of drawing and 
practical work to be done during the vacation. 
Those attending the industrial teachers’ department of the Building 
Trades School of Karlsruhe are further required to attend all excur- 
sions prescribed by the director of the school to industrial plants of 
the neighborhood. When necessary some pecuniary assistance will 
be given to those employed during the vacations or taking part in 
the excursions. All students in the school are required to take part 
in the seminary practice. Each one in the department must prepare 
one or two tasks each semester and, after the expiration of the time 
given for working it out, must present it for approval. 
         
                                                       
   
   
   
    
    
   THE KARLSRUHE BUILDING TRADES SCHOOL. 
The following description of the Karlsruhe Building Trades School 
includes the general purpose of the institution and a detailed account 
of the work of the department for the training of industrial teachers: 
The Karlsruhe Building Trades School was founded in the year 
1878 as a State institution. Its purpose is to train men for the 
building, machine, and electrical trades, to prepare for the work of 
building and the factory, as well is to prepare artisans of middle rank 
to act as officials in the State and community. For this reason the 
instruction in theory must depend upon the practical needs of the 
industries. 
The Building Trades School also undertakes the education of 
industrial teachers. Learning industrial handicraft depends upon 
the practice of the building operations and the workshop, and must, 
for all pupils, precede their admission into the institution. Accord- 
ingly the practical exercises which are carried on in a few classes in 
the institution are handled so as to lay the principal emphasis upon 
the theoretical development of the trade and upon the solution of 
difficult problems. The successive classes last one-half year each. 
They may, with few exceptions, be attended either in summer or 
winter, according to the personal convenience of the pupils. 
AIM AND ORGANIZATION OF THE INSTITUTION. 
The school consists of the following five divisions: 
I. The building trades division—This division has the task of 
training State master builders for the city and country, superin- 
tendents of buildings, draftsmen, and master workmen certificated 
by the State, as well as engineers of middle rank for the State and 
community offices. The instruction is imparted in six classes, each 
of one-half year’s duration. The sixth class is attended mainly by 
those who wish to undertake the State master builder’s examina- 
tion, and is maintained only in winter.  
-P-A-G-E-432
  412 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
Il. Road-building and hydraulic engineering division.—The training 
of pupils in this division takes place in six successive classes of one- 
half year’s duration each. This division aims, first, at training 
engineers in the road and hydraulic service as officials for both State 
and community, as well as for industrial undertakings. While those 
finishing this division of the school are admitted to the State master 
builder’s examination, the under classes provide the necessary train- 
ing for passing the road master’s theoretical examination. The 
building superintendents and draftsmen, as well as the street and 
dike masters, find suitable opportunities for vocational education 
as soon as the introductory training and practice complies with the 
conditions of admission to the examination. The fifth class is car- 
ried on in summer; the sixth in winter only. 
Ill. The machine trades division—This division undertakes to 
train machine engineers for the State bureau of construction and 
for the workshop. ‘The instruction is given in five classes, each of 
one-half year’s duration. Those attending this division as a rule 
enter later into private industrial plants or the railway service, and 
eventually become railway engineers, foremen, or master workmen. 
Those finishing this course are qualified to take the State foreman’s 
examination. 
IV. Electrical division—The training of students in this division 
also falls into five successive classes, each of one-half year’s duration, 
and during the first three semesters the course is the same as that 
of the machine trades division. The purpose of this division is to 
train electrical engineers for the bureau of construction and for the 
workshop, as well as for conducting the business of smaller electrical 
establishments and individual plants. After finishing this division 
they go either into the production of electrotechnical products, or 
into the State or community offices or into private electrical business. 
This division also offers to young people the instruction necessary 
to enable them to establish themselves as independent workers in 
electrical installation. Those finishing this division are qualified to 
take the State foreman’s or master builder’s examination. 
V. Division for the training of industrial teachers.—This division 
aims at preparing teachers to give the industrial and technical 
instruction prescribed by the laws of the country for the industrial 
schools, and is, of course, attended mainly by students who intend 
to devote themselves to the teaching profession. Candidates for 
positions as industrial teachers must attend the institution seven 
semesters, and then pass the regular State teacher’s examination. 
Candidates who seek admission into the lower classes of the first 
four divisions of the Karlsruhe Building Trades School must have 
finished their sixteenth year. At the time of admission candidates 
must pass an examination in German, arithmetic, and the theory of
-P-A-G-E-433
TRAINING OF VOCATIONAL TEACHERS IN GERMANY. 413 
projection. Besides this, previous practical experience in the indus- 
tries is demanded under all circumsatnces for admission into the 
lowest classes of any one of the four divisions. This practical expe- 
rience must amount to at least 2 full years (24 months), in which 
service in an office is not to be counted. The experience must be 
obtained as follows: (4) For the architectural division, in actual 
building operations; (2) for the road building and hydraulic division, 
in actual work of this class; (3) for the machine engineer, in the 
machine shop; (4) for the electrical division, also in the machine 
shop in the following proportions: Students with predominatingly 
machine-engineering training must take from the minimum require- 
ments of 2 years’ experience at least 9 months in an electro-technical 
manufactory, in electro-technical business, or in fitting up electrical 
plants; students who attend this division with predominatingly elec- 
tro-technical experience must complete at least 9 months’ practice 
in general machine building trades. 
Besides this 2 years’ practice or apprenticeship the candidate 
for admission must produce proof that he has either attended an indus- 
trial school or completed the fifth class of a middle school. In excep- 
tional cases only and on account of especially good work students 
from an industrial continuation school may gain admission. It is 
important that pupils who possess the certificate for 1 year’s mili- 
tary service or who have finished the classes of a middle school, men- 
tioned above, should receive additional instruction in an industrial 
school in addition to their practical work before their entrance into 
the building-trades school. 
If a candidate for admission into the first class has taken some other 
preparatory course he must prove a corresponding degree of knowl- 
edge by the passing of a special entrance examination. If students 
who enter the first class of the architectural division (or who expect 
to enter the profession of building contractor, superintendent of 
buildings, or the like) have only had practice as stonecutters or car- 
penters, they are urged in their own interest to arrange for a longer 
period of practical experience in the mason trade before entering the 
business. Those, on the contrary, who have worked as cabinet- 
makers, glaziers, and the like must, before entering the second or 
third class, show a longer practical experience in masonry. 
In general it is recommended that no long interruption of school 
attendance be permitted. Students who have dropped out of the 
institution for a longer period than 3 semesters and who wish to 
reenter by reason of the new course of study must pass an examina- 
tion in mathematics and constructional subjects to prove that they 
are qualified to attend higher classes. 
The division for the training of industrial teachers is open only to 
those who bring proof of having been accepted as elementary school 
. 
 
-P-A-G-E-434
  414 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
candidates or of having finished 7 classes of a middle school. The 
completion of the seventeenth year marks the earliest period for 
admission into this division. Besides this, it is required that one 
entering this division shall have finished at-least 3 months’ prac- 
tical activity in some large building business, and that before attend- 
ing the fourth class elementary schoolteachers shall undertake at 
least a year of further practice, while those coming from the seventh 
class of a middle school must complete 2 years in practical work. 
It is recommended that students of the middle school finish 1 year 
of this practice before they enter, instead of the minimum 3 months’ 
practice. 
During their vacations, or during the period of their absence from 
school, in order that they may advance in their education and increase 
their understanding of national methods of building, students of the 
architectural division are directed to prepare photographs and draw- 
ings of fine old buildings and their parts. This serves as a prepara- 
tion for subjects of instruction which form the substance of the course 
in the next higher class. The examples chosen are sketched under 
the direction of the teacher. 
The students of the industrial teachers’ division are required to 
make use of the autumn vacation for learning some of the industrial 
handwork mentioned above. The Easter holidays, on the other 
hand, are used for the taking of photographs of buildings and artistic 
objects of all kinds. State assistance is at the disposal of both divi- 
sions to defray the expenses of visits to manufactories and the like, 
as well as to pay for well-prepared photographs. 
Candidates in this division pay a matriculation fee of 5 marks 
($1.19). The tuition fee is 40 marks ($9.52) for citizens of the Em- 
pire and 80 marks ($19.04) for foreigners. 
At the opening of every semester, instruction in hygiene is given to 
the new students by the conductor of the so-called Samaritan course. 
This course covers the principal points a student should know in order 
to preserve health of body and mind. 
In order to promote acquaintance with graphic subjects, all stu- 
dents, from the lowest classes on, have to prepare sketchbooks in an 
orderly way. The sketches in these books and photographs are as 
far as possible used in instruction. 
EXCURSIONS. 
For the encouragement of nature studies and for securing a sys- 
tematic training in observation, excursions to investigate suitable 
subjects are undertaken, and wherever possible graphic. representa- 
tions are prepared, to be worked out later in the classes. 
Saturday afternoons are free from classroom work, both in summer 
and winter. On these afternoons, as occasion arises, excursions are 
.
-P-A-G-E-435
  
  TRAINING OF VOCATIONAL TEACHERS IN GERMANY. 415 
undertaken by all divisions and classes in the school for the purpose 
of inspecting buildings in course of construction, workshops, manu- 
factories, roads, exhibits, and the like, as well as for practice in 
drawing in the open and in photographing agricultural buildings, 
monuments, and other objects worth reproducing. 
Students of all divisions and classes take part in excursions in the 
week after Whitsuntide, which, as far as possible, cover all subjects 
in the course of study. These excursions are as far as possible in the 
neighborhood of Karlsruhe, and, as a rule, extend over two days. In 
case of greater distances three days are used. State aid is given to 
students to meet the cost of these excursions, and considerable reduc- 
tion is made in transportation rates. All students concerned must 
take part-in these general excursions.

  These demands upon vocational teachers in Wurttemberg and 
Baden will seem very high to an American. Our American demands 
are not as a rule as exacting even as those of Prussia. In both Prussia 
and America practical men and academic teachers are prepared for 
service in vocational schools by means of short courses. On the whole, 
I believe that Prussia demands more of such teachers than America. 
In South Germany the vocational work for the lower grades is more 
highly developed than in Prussia or anywhere else in the world. 
These States have passed through the period when half-prepared

  TRAINING OF VOCATIONAL TEACHERS IN GERMANY. 417 
teachers were permitted to undertake educational work of any sort. 
They have experienced the results of permitting misfit mechanics 
with little or no pedagogical training, and ordinary academic teach- 
ers with no technical training worth mentioning to undertake the 
preparation of youth for practical life. It is now realized that neither 
the half-trained mechanic nor the mere academic teacher can be in 
touch with actual industrial conditions. They endeavor, therefore, 
by their courses to train the teachers technically and the mechanics 
pedagogically. They encourage these vocational teachers to keep 
in touch with actual industrial business conditions, both by constant 
visits to industrial plants and business operations, and by permitting 
them to carry on industrial and business occupations as a side issue. 
This practice is usually discountenanced in America, but in Germany 
it is believed that it will aid in keeping these schools practical; will 
prevent them from crystallizing into institutions completely out of 
touch with the needs of the time.

  CHAPTER XII. 
EDUCATION IN PORTO RICO. 
[An abridgment of the report of 1910-11 of E. G. Dewter, Commissioner of Education for 
Porto Rico.] 
ORGANIZATION. 
The commissioner of education for Porto Rico, appointed by the 
President, is the head of the Department of Education. With the 
exception of certain classes of teachers, he appoints all subordinates 
in the department, prescribes courses of study, fixes the length of 
the school year within legal limits, directs the examination and cer- 
tification of teachers, and controls the expenditure of all school 
moneys. He is a member of the Executive Council, the upper house 
of the legislature, and is ex officio president of the University of 
Porto Rico and of the trustees of the Insular Library. Associated 
with him are an assistant commissioner, the secretary of the depart- 
ment, 3 general superintendents of schools, 40 supervising principals, 
and the necessary business and clerical assistants. 
The island of Porto Rico contains 66 units of political organiza- 
tion, termed “ municipalities,” in each of which is elected a school 
board consisting of three members. These boards have charge of 
the common-school buildings, hold title to property, negotiate loans 
under certain conditions, supervise the discipline of the schools, and, 
subject to the approval of the commissioner, appoint teachers. They 
annually submit to the commissioner a detailed statement of the ex- 
penditures they desire to make during the coming year, and the 
approval of that budget is the warrant for the expenditure of the 
funds listed therein. 
Teachers of rural schools enter the service at $30 per school month, 
and may be promoted to $35 a month after three years’ successful 
experience, and to $40 after five years. Rural teachers receive also 
an allowance in lieu of house rent, varying from $3 to $8 per month. 
Teachers in graded schools in the cities and smaller centers of 
population receive $45, $50, or $55 per month, according to their 
classification based upon successful experience. Those who are cer- 
tified as competent to use the English language as the medium of 
419
-P-A-G-E-440
  420 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
instruction receive $5 per month additional. The number of these 
is rapidly increasing, and within a few years the classification of 
“Spanish graded teachers” will no longer exist. Graded-school 
teachers receive from $8 to $20 per month in lieu of house rent in _ 
addition to their respective salaries. 
The rural and graded school teachers comprise the great mass of 
teachers in the common schools of the island, and are all chosen by 
the local school boards, with the approval of the commissioner of 
education. In addition to them, however, five classes of teachers 
are appointed directly by the commissioner of education, namely, 
teachers of English, special teachers in continuation schools, special 
teachers, agricultural teachers, and high-school teachers. 
At least one “teacher of English” must be assigned to each mu- 
nicipality having a graded-school system. One hundred and twelve 
are included in the provisions for the present school year, at a salary 
of $75 per month each. They now serve as grade teachers in the 
higher grades, giving instruction in all the subjects of their respec- 
tive grades, excepting the Spanish language. The former plan of 
requiring them to go from room to room, giving instruction in Eng- 
lish to all pupils, proved unsatisfactory, for all the other subjects 
were taught in Spanish and little progress was made in the acquisi- 
tion of the English language. Nearly all the teachers of English are 
Americans, and a large proportion were graduated from colleges and 
normal schools. 
Special manual training and trade schools have been established 
in 12 municipalities, and in each school there must be at least two 
specialists, one in manual training and one in domestic science, and 
each must be competent to teach also the academic subjects of the 
first two years of the high-school course. The budget for the com- 
ing year provides for 20 such specialists in continuation schools at 
a salary of $83.33 per month each. 
“ Special teachers” are teachers of music and art and kindergarten 
teachers, and are employed only for the larger towns. The budget 
provides for 16 of them at $75 per month each. 
Agricultural teachers are assigned to elementary agricultural 
schools, and are employed throughout the entire year at $60 per 
calendar month each. 
High-school teachers receive from $750 to $1,500 each per school 
year. 
The island is divided for purposes of administration into 40 dis- 
tricts, in each of which is a supervising principal who is the imme- 
diate representative of the commissioner of education. The salaries 
of these officers vary from $1,200 to $1,500, depending upon the num- 
ber of-schools under their supervision. An allowance of $240 per 
 
-P-A-G-E-441
    EDUCATION IN PORTO RICO. 421 
annum is granted to each of them for house rent, and those who 
supervise more than one municipality are allowed $200 annually in 
addition. 
RURAL SCHOOLS. 
With few exceptions rural schools are located in the country dis- 
tricts wherever needed and where funds are available for their main- 
tenance, and they are often reached only by long, hard climbs up 
the mountain trails. During the school year 1910-11, 1,648 of these 
schools were maintained, counting as two schools each school build- 
ing where different groups of pupils attend in the morning and in 
the afternoon. 
Although the number of rural schools equipped with modern fur- 
niture and appliances is increasing year by year, still many remind 
one of the primitive red schoolhouse of New England, with its tables 
and backless benches. The rural schéolhouses vary greatly in their 
style of architecture. ‘Some are simply thatched-roof structures of 
the simplest native construction, while others are substantial cement 
buildings. Only. a comparatively small proportion of these build- 
ings have been constructed by the Government for school purposes, 
the majority being rented. In no instance, however, is the same 
structure used for school and for residence purposes. At present 
854 different buildings are used for rural schools in addition to the 
207 graded-school buildings. 
In nearly every instance the surroundings of the rural-school 
buildings have been beautified by trees and school gardens. This 
work is done almost entirely by the pupils themselves, and is in- 
spired largely by the Department of Education by offering annually 
a diploma to the school in each of the 40 school districts which has 
done most during the year to beautify its surroundings. In fact, as 
one journeys through the island, the most attractive spots in the 
landscape are usually the school buildings, with their pretty gar- 
dens and the Stars and Stripes floating above them. 
Considering the fact that at the time of the American occupation 
there was but one building within the island used exclusively for 
school purposes, the progress which has been made is little short 
of marvelous. With 1,061 buildings used exclusively for school 
purposes, there is one such structure for each 3.4 square miles through- 
out the island. Only in a very few States of the United States is 
the territory tributary to a schoolhouse so small as in Porto Rico, 
and those States are among the most thickly populated of the north- 
eastern tier. But because of the density of the population there is 
only one school building for each 1,053 people, while for the United 
States there is one school building for each 345 inhabitants.
-P-A-G-E-442
  422 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
The course of study for the rural schools covers a six-year period, 
although not all of the rural schools have students in all the grades. 
Up to the year 1907-8, none of the rural schools of the island carried 
its pupils beyond the third year. Conditions are, however, rapidly 
changing and it seems probable that within a few years no one of the 
schools of this class will be offering less than a full six-year course. 
GRADED SCHOOLS, 
Graded-school systems are maintained in each of the 68 munici- 
palities of the island. In each instance such a system is found in the 
principal center of population of the municipality, and in a con- 
siderable number of municipalities in the more populous barrios. 
The course of study of the graded schools covers the full eight grades 
of the common-school course, although in a few municipalities no 
students have as yet reached the upper grades. Students who com- 
plete the full eight-year course and pass an examination set by the 
department, which is uniform for the island, receive a common- 
school diploma. For the school year 1910-11 the number of candi- 
dates passing this examination was 967. The number of persons 
receiving a common-school diploma has increased very rapidly during 
recent years. 
Persons from other countries visiting the graded schools of the 
island are impressed by the favorable conditions under which the 
work is carried on. The buildings, mostly of a modified Spanish 
type of architecture and nearly all constructed of cement, are pleas- 
ing in appearance, well lighted, and well ventilated. With the cli- 
matic conditions prevailing in Porto Rico the problem of heating 
is entirely eliminated and the problems of ventilation are reduced 
to a minimum by the prevailing custom of constructing buildings 
with windows extending practically from the ceiling to the floor. 
These windows are entirely without glass and are open throughout 
the school session, except when occasional showers make it neces- 
sary to close the shutters. The ceilings in all schoolrooms are high, 
usually between 12 and 14 feet from the floor, all of which conditions 
make for perfect ventilation. In fact more healthful surroundings 
in school work could hardly be found than those enjoyed by the 
graded-school pupils in Porto Rico. Almost without exception the 
school equipment is as complete and perfect as can be found any- 
where. Adjustable desks of modern type of construction are used 
for the pupils, the teachers are provided with adequate desks, the 
blackboards are in many instances of slate and ample in amount, 
while charts, maps, and globes are provided as needed. Great pride 
is taken by both teachers and pupils in schoolroom decoration, and 
classrcoms are rare in which framed portraits of Washington, Lin-

coln, or some of the more recent Presidents of the United States are 
not to be found, and frequently well-selected engravings or other pic- 
tures find places on the walls. The graded-school buildings are 
usually named after some prominent personage—the names of Wash- 
ington, Jefferson, Lincoln, McKinley, and Roosevelt, and of other 
prominent Americans being frequently used. In some instances 
schools are named for Porto Rican patriots, but in no case has the 
name of a living Porto Rican still in active political life been ap- 
proved for this purpose by the Department of Education. Among 
the more pretentious graded-school buildings of the island are the 
Jefferson School of Arecibo, with 22 rooms; the San Juan Public 
School No. 1, with 21 rooms; the Caguas Public School, with 16 
rooms, and the Roosevelt and McKinley Schools of Ponce, each with 
12 rooms. 
The course of study for the graded schools is quite abreast of that 
of the best public-school systems in the United States. In fact in 
not a few instances pupils have removed to the States after having 
completed in part the graded-school course of the island, and have 
entered grades in advance of those in which they were enrolled while 
in Porto Rico. In addition, moreover, to the academic accomplish- 
ments required by equivalent grades in the United States, the pupils 
from the Porto Rican schools were bilingual, having approximately 
equal proficiency in the Spanish and English languages. 
In a considerable number of the larger towns of the island instruc- 
tion is given to pupils in the upper grades in manual training and 
domestic science, though not in a sufficient number of towns to make 
it possible as yet to include these subjects in the required course of 
these grades. 
SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
High schools —Fully organized high schools with four-year courses 
are in successful operation at San Juan, Ponce, and Mayaguez. In 
each of them is to be found a fully equipped commercial department, 
in addition to classical and scientific courses, which are equal to those 
of moderately well-equipped high schools of the United States. Their 
graduates enter any college or university in the United States without 
difficulty. 
No student is admitted to any of the high schools of the island who 
has not completed the eighth year of work in the graded schools, or 
its equivalent. The requirements for graduation and the course of 
study are the same for all the schools. The requirements for entrance 
to the commercial courses are the same as for the other courses, but 
the time required to complete them is but two years, at the end of 
which time a certificate is granted. These courses include all the 
 
-P-A-G-E-444
  
  424 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
subjects necessary to preparation for the work of a stenographer, 
typewriter, and bookkeeper. 
The Central High School at San Juan has never been provided with 
adequate quarters, and is at present occupying what has been known 
as “Las Palmas Hotel,” in Santurce. The building is beautifully 
situated, with large and attractive grounds, and answers very well the 
purpose for which it is used. The instructional force of the school 
consists of a principal and nine assistants, including special instruc- 
tors in music, drawing, and domestic science. The last-named depart- 
ment is well equipped for the present needs of the school. The enroll- 
ment for this year is 140. 
The Ponce High School, with an enrollment of 236, is the largest in 
Porto Rico. It provides, in addition to the high-school courses, 
courses for teachers, under the supervision of the normal department. 
of the University of Porto Rico. The normal students take their 
diplomas from the normal department of the University, and 33 
received licenses to teach in the public schools of the island. Most of 
the graduates of the four-year course continue their studies in the 
north, and the school has representatives at Cornell, Syracuse, Wes- 
leyan, University of Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania State College, 
Stevens Institute, Wellesley, Woman’s College of Baltimore, Swarth- 
more, Wilson, University of Louisiana, etc., all of which institutions 
they enter on the certificate of the school. All graduates of the com- 
mercial course have secured positions, and most of them secure places 
before completing the course, so great is the demand. 
The Mayaguez High School opened the school year of 1910-11 
with an enrollment of 100 pupils. There is a faculty of five instruc- 
tors, which will be increased for the next year in order to meet the 
demand which the increase in enrollment will necessitate. 
During the past year ninth, tenth, and eleventh grade work has 
been offered at Arecibo, and the budget for the year 1911-12 makes 
provision for a fully equipped high school at that place, with four 
teachers. 
Continuation schools.—The continuation schools of the island are 
only in their inception, the first having been established less than two 
years. These schools take pupils who have received the eighth-grade 
diploma, and carry them two years further in their educational career, 
the basis of the course being manual training, domestic science, and 
sewing. At the end of this two-year period the pupils are prepared 
to go out with a fair knowledge of the practical side of life, or they 
may enter the high schools, receiving full credit for all work done in 
the continuation school. With the beginning of the school year 
1911-12 each one of the 12 schools of this description will have 
benches and full manual training equipment for from 12 to 24 boys, 
and domestic science equipment for an equal number of girls, as well 
 
-P-A-G-E-445
  EDUCATION IN PORTO RICO. 425 
as all the requisites for courses in sewing and other branches of 
household economy. 
The total enrollment for the high and continuation schools for 
1910-11 was 905, as compared with 711 for the previous year. The 
average daily enrollment was 788 for the past year, and the average 
daily attendance, 738. 
AGRICULTURAL INSTRUCTION. 
One of the main difficulties which have prevented more rapid exten- 
sion of the work in agriculture has been the impossibility of securing 
teachers competent to give instruction in the subject. In the early 
days of the American school in Porto Rico there were 19 so-called 
agricultural schools scattered over the island. These schools were 
planned to combine instruction in agriculture with the ordinary in- 
struction given in the rural schools, but the results obtained were far 
from satisfactory, as it was not possible to differentiate these schools 
sufficiently from other rural schools, obtain competent teachers, and 
“secure pupils who, by reason of age and physical development, were 
fitted for agricultural labor. 
As a result of discussions, the teachers of agriculture during the 
past year have not been placed in charge of schools and have not 
been obliged to teach any branch other than their specialty. They 
have been assigned to different towns, and have given instruction to 
all pupils enrolled in the graded schools who were old enough and 
who were physically able to benefit by such instruction. Due to 
budgetary limitations but five teachers of agriculture were appointed 
for the past year. 
According to reports received, a total of 1,663 pupils, an increase 
of almost 500 as compared with the preceding year, received practical 
and theoretical instruction in agriculture. Generally speaking, pupils 
from the fourth grade and upward received instruction for four 
periods of 30 minutes each week in the theory of agriculture, and 
practical instruction was given for one or two hours once a week. 
In developing the practical side of agriculture emphasis has been 
placed not only on beautifying the school surroundings, but also on 
beautifying the public plazas and the homes. In nature study, which 
is a required subject in all first, second, and third grades in the island, 
emphasis is laid on elementary agriculture and school gardening. 
Flower gardens have been cultivated by the girls, while individual 
vegetable gardens occupied the attention of the boys. In some mu- 
nicipalities each pupil had a plot averaging about 10 by 10 feet, and 
tomatoes, lettuce, potatoes, corn, beets, peppers, beans, peas, gandules, 
okra, eggplant, melons, etc., were raised. The fact that the girls in 
many instances made use of the pick and shovel, the long-handled 
spade, and even the wheelbarrow, leaves no room to doubt the interest  
-P-A-G-E-446
  
426 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
aroused. The smaller children were taught to use only the lighter 
implements, such as hoes and rakes, but the larger ones built fences, 
laid paths, opened ditches, mixed fertilizer, and applied manure and 
lime. 
The proper value and full dignity of manual labor have been em- 
phatically impressed on pupils and parents as well, and the small 
children and young men and women alike have not hesitated to soil 
their hands in the various field and garden operations entrusted to 
them. 
Tn at least one town an agricultural exhibit was held toward the 
close of the school year. This exhibit was a complete success and was 
attended by such numbers that many had to wait outside the build- 
ing until there was room to enter. 
For the present school year 10 special teachers of agriculture are 
included in the budget, and these will receive pay for the 12 calendar 
months instead of for the 9 school months, as heretofore. At the 
present time these teachers are conducting summer schools in agri- 
culture in the towns to which they are assigned, and pupils of the 
upper grades, teachers, and any others able to profit by the courses 
are allowed to enroll. These teachers are to hold conferences of a 
practical nature with the parents and farmers and in every possible 
way arouse the interest and enthusiasm of the general public. 
Wherever possible during this year the teachers of agriculture will 
meet the rural teachers once a week for the purpose of giving them 
practical lessons in agriculture and of explaining the best methods 
to be used in teaching this subject to their pupils. All teachers and 
others who attended the Insular Fair saw what could be done with 
comparatively little labor and expense in the beautification of school 
grounds. The department was granted the use of a piece of marsh 
land adjoining the model rural school building, and this was con- 
verted into one of the beauty spots of the fair. The land was drained 
and artistically laid out in plots for flowers and vegetables. It was 
not an infrequent sight to see teachers with paper and pencil in hand 
making a sketch of the model school garden in order to carry out in 
their own schools the ideas suggested. 
Training in agriculture is essential and is adapted to the children 
of Porto Rico, and as soon as a sufficient number of competent teach- 
ers can be secured it should be made obligatory in all the schools of 
the island. 
INDUSTRIAL WORK FOR BOYS. 
Previous to the year 1907 there was in operation a system of trade 
schools in the larger cities of the island, but the legislature of 1907 
failed to make appropriations for their continuance and they were 
discontinued. 
 
-P-A-G-E-447
  
EDUCATION IN PORTO RICO. 427 
With no appropriation specifically for the work in the manual 
arts in the public schools in general, it has not been possible to accom- 
plish much along those lines. However, in some instances teachers 
have been found with special aptitude for constructive work in wood 
and iron, and such teachers have been encouraged to devote time dur- 
ing the school hours to such work. In this way hundreds of pupils 
have been receiving instruction in woodworking and in the construc- 
tion of various articles from such native products as bamboo, cala- 
baza, and various fibers. 
At the Insular Fair there was a surprising display, especially from 
the rural schools, of products of this kind. In many instances real 
artistic ability was expressed in the objects constructed, and under 
better organized and more specific instruction it would seem that 
there are great economic possibilities in such work. 
In addition to this semiofficial manual instruction regular manual 
training shops are in operation in connection with the schools of nine 
towns, with about 500 pupils receiving instruction. The work varies 
from clay modeling and whittling to regular bench work. In one 
town, Rio Piedras, the boys built a two-room house for a carpenter 
shop and domestic-science room, and made their own: tables, besides 
other articles for the use of the school. In another town playground 
apparatus was built, repairs were made on school buildings, and a 
fence was constructed in the plaza. A further indication of the in- 
terest in this work is the fact that there are 48 students enrolled in the 
‘manual-training classes in the two summer institutes now in session. 
From the indications here given it would seem that there is a suffi- 
ciently strong desire on the part of the people of Porto Rico to war- 
rant more decided steps in this direction in the future. Such advance 
has been partly provided for in the new course of study for the con- 
tinuation schools, and will be prosecuted in lower grades wherever 
practicable. A special teacher, experienced in giving manual train- 
ing, will be assigned to each continuation school next year, and in- 
struction in this work will be offered to as many boys of the graded 
schools as can be accommodated. 
SEWING. 
In 1909-10 instruction in sewing was offered in but one town of 
the island, but the interest of parents and pupils was such that it was 
decided to offer such instruction in as many towns as possible during 
the past year. As no provision was made in the budget for this 
phase of work an appeal was made to the school boards, urging them, 
if possible, to provide the necessary equipment to establish the classes 
and to vote a small amount as compensation to the teachers. The 
school boards responded in a way that was exceedingly encouraging, 
and as a result work in sewing was offered in 56 of the 66 towns of 
 
-P-A-G-E-448
    
428 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
the island, and 5,241 girls, or almost 76 per cent of those enrolled in 
the grades and schools in which sewing was offered, took advantage 
of the instruction. 
Needles, pins, thimbles, scissors, paper for drafting patterns, 
and cotton, muslin, and linen cloth were provided by the school 
boards in many instances, while in others the equipment was sup- 
plied by either the pupils or parents. 
The Porto Rican girls are very apt in making embroidery, fancy 
lace, and drawn work, but are not so efficient in plain sewing, mend- 
ing, darning, and patching. Therefore great stress was laid on the 
teaching of the elementary stitches on heavy cloth and on the appli- 
cation of the principles of the art of needlework to the requirements 
of the home. At first practically all the pupils wished instruction 
in fancywork rather than in plain sewing, but the interest in the 
latter increased very gratifyingly during the year. 
The exhibit at the First Insular Fair of work done in the sewing 
classes was of exceptional interest and value. About 1,000 different 
pieces were displayed, including practically everything from samples 
of the different stitches, patches, etc., to the most beautiful laces and 
drawn work. P 
In some towns the garments made in the sewing classes were given 
to poor children in order that they might attend school, and in others 
they were given to hospitals and other charitable institutions. 
Whenever the materials were furnished by the parents the articles _ 
made were taken home. In several instances where the local board 
furnished the materials the articles made have been sold and the 
proceeds devoted to the purchase of more material or to help to 
support the school libraries, bands, or playgrounds. 
COOKING. 
Instruction in cooking was continued in the high and grammar 
schools at San Juan and extended to three other municipalities, viz, 
Rio Piedras, Juncos, and Yauco, during the past year. The total 
number of girls enrolled for this work in the above-mentioned towns 
was 159. Teachers with special preparation have had charge of the 
work at each place and, with the exception of San Juan, the equip- 
ment has been furnished by the local school board. 
In each town where cooking classes were established the attitude 
of the general public was highly satisfactory, and as a result many 
pupils reported that their parents had bought ovens and other 
utensils used in the schools in order to prepare their food at home as 
taught in the classes. 
One town reported that for the next year a class in cooking would 
be held early in the morning before school begins, in order to pre- 
pare coffee and bread to be sold at cost to the children who come to
-P-A-G-E-449
EDUCATION IN PORTO RICO, 429 
school without sufficient nourishment. Not infrequently children 
become faint in school for lack of food, and poor children who can 
not afford to pay for a cup of coffee will be given work after school 
hours. 
The little that has been done along this line is sufficient to prove 
the necessity of extending this kind of instruction as “rapidly as 
possible. The number of teachers able to give instruction in this 
branch will be greatly augmented by the large number of young 
ladies who are taking the courses in domestic science offered in the 
normal department of the University of Porto Rico. 
To each of the continuation schools allotted for the coming year 
a teacher will be appointed who is capable to teach cooking and 
sewing to the girls, and this work will be made obligatory. It is 
also hoped that the school boards in all towns where competent 
teachers are to be found will provide the necessary equipment in 
order that as large a proportion as possible of the girls enrolled in 
the graded school system may receive instruction in both cooking 
and sewing. 
      
     
   
                      
                        
   
    
             
   MUSICAL INSTRUCTION. 
Special teachers of music have had charge of the musical educa- 
tion of all the pupils enrolled in the graded schools of San Juan, 
Ponce, and Arecibo. In all other schools of the island the regular 
room teacher gives instruction in this branch, but instruction is 
confined to the teaching of patriotic songs in both English and Span- 
ish and many rote songs for use in connection with the opening and 
closing exercises and school festivals. 
In 29 towns of the island school bands are maintained by the local 
school boards. Each band is under the direction of a competent 
instructor, who gives instruction not only to members of the band, 
but also to as many other boys as possible. As a rule the school 
bands play while the pupils march in and out of school and at all 
school entertainments. Not infrequently the bands give evening 
concerts on the public plazas. 
During the past year the school boards have spent over $7,800 for 
music, instruments, and salaries of instructors, and a sum equal to 
or greater than that amount has been raised by public subscription 
and donations from municipal councils. 
The excellence of the school bands was demonstrated at the com- 
petitive contest of school bands held during the First Insular Fair, 
at which 11 different bands were entered. 
NIGHT SCHOOLS. 
These schools have been maintained during the past year in every 
nunicipality of the island. The school law provides that the com- 
missioner, upon application from 20 or more young persons unable 
 
-P-A-G-E-450
  430 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
to attend day school, may establish a night school, and that adults 
may be admitted to such school when, in the judgment of the local 
school authorities, they are able to profit by the instruction offered 
and their presence in the school does not operate to the exclusion 
of eligible young persons who desire admission. The night schools 
are intrusted to the care of day-school teachers, who receive extra 
compensation for this additional service. 
As night schools can be conducted at a relatively small expense, it 
has been the policy of the department to establish them wherever 
there was reasonable prospect of success. In light of the results 
obtained in the night schools established in the rural sections during 
the past year and due to the repeated requests from young people 
in the country many more schools of this class have been in opera- 
tion during that year than ever before. 
A few night schools in the larger cities of the island have been con- 
ducted exclusively in English and the number of night schools in 
which English has been taught as a special subject has been greatly 
increased. 
In Ponce a night school in mechanical drawing has been in opera- 
tion during the past year, but as it did not appeal to many persons 
outside the student body of the high school, the attendance was small 
and the results accomplished were not very satisfactory. Several 
supervising principals have recommended that sewing and manual 
training be introduced into the night school next year, and wherever 
possible it will be done. 
During the first term of 1910-11 there were 262 night schools in 
operation, 273 in the second term, and 245 in the third term. On | 
March 1, 1911, when the annual school census was taken, there were 
8,780 pupils enrolled in the night schools as compared with 4,962 on 
the same date of the year preceding.    
   
   
   
        
   
   
   
        
   
    
     
      
   
   MILITARY DRILL. 
Largely as the result of the interest aroused by a letter from the 
Department of Education, military drill was established in not less 
than 21 municipalities of the island, with a regiment of 1,089 boys 
under drill. The military organization has always been familiar to 
the people of Porto Rico and they seem to have an innate aptness for 
military tactics. The pupils as a rule have made very rapid progress 
in drill, with marked results so far as erectness of carriage and gen- 
eral tidiness of person are concerned. 
Of the 21 companies in the island, 13 are uniformed, while 7 are} 
provided with guns. In some instances these are but wooden arms, 
not infrequently made by members of the companies themselves, but 
answering every purpose.

   It is hoped that before the end of another school year companies 
will have been established in other towns of the island, and that the 
benefits of a summer encampment may be had. 
In addition to the companies here mentioned, many of ‘is towns 
have companies of boy scouts, with one of the teachers as scout 
master.” 
SCHOLARSHIPS. 
The Legislative Assembly of Porto Rico has at various times 
made provision for the maintenance of deserving students at differ- 
ent educational institutions through the establishment of scholarships, 
and at present it is doubtful if there is a more complete system of 
scholarship support in vogue in any country. In fact, it is possible 
for a bright pupil in the remotest barrio within the island to be car- 
ried through to graduation at the best university in the United States 
entirely as a Government scholarship student. 
Through legislation passed in 1908 school boards are empowered 
to use not to exceed 5 per cent of their total funds for the purpose of 
maintaining at the graded schools of the urban center of the munic- 
ipality pupils who have completed with credit the work of the rural 
schools. During the past year 28 such scholarship students have been 
maintained by 11 school boards, at a total expense of $2,124.63. This 
makes it possible for a bright child in the barrio to secure his eighth- 
grade diploma as a scholarship student in the urban center. Having 
received his eighth-grade diploma, there are open to him, through 
appointment by the commissioner of education, 80 scholarships, of an 
annual value of $108 each, in the high schools of the island. Since 
the amount mentioned is actually paid to the scholarship student in 
cash and since there are no charges for tuition, textbooks, or supplies, 
it is quite possible for the student to maintain himself entirely upon 
his scholarship allotment. 
In case the preference of the eighth-grade graduate leads him in 
another direction, there are open to him 40 scholarships in the agricul- 
tural department of the University of Porto Rico of the same value 
s the high-school scholarships. Deserving students hold these 
cholarships for the full four-year course of the Agricultural College 
nd are graduated as scientific agriculturists. 
To students who have completed the first year in the high schools 
r continuation schools of the island—that is, have completed the 
inth- ‘grade work in the school system—there are open 75 scholar- 
hips in the normal department of the University of Porto Rico, each 
f a value of $200 annually. Graduation from this department of 
the university means immediate entrance into the corps of public- 
chool teachers of the island with a practically assured income during 
‘ood behavior.  
-P-A-G-E-452
  
  432 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
To students completing the common-school course is also open an- 
other class of scholarships for study in Tuskegee Institute, Hampton 
Institute, or other institutions of a similar character in the United 
States. Twenty scholarship students are maintained in this class, 
each receiving an annual income from the Government of $250. 
The most desirable of all the scholarships maintained by the Goy- 
ernment of Porto Rico are those providing for study in the colleges 
and universities of the United States, such scholarships being of an 
annual value of $500. The law establishing these scholarships pro- 
vided for 25 for men and 14 for women, though of recent years the 
annual appropriations have not provided for so large a number of - 
either sex. The law requires that the commission intrusted with the 
appointment of such scholarship students shall in the case of men 
give preference to the students who wish to fit themselves as scientific 
agriculturists, engineers, or foresters. At present scholarship students 
of this class are pursuing courses in Columbia University, Cornell 
University, University of Pennsylvania, University of linois, Uni- 
versity of Louisiana, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and 
other prominent institutions of the United States. 
Besides the foregoing classes of scholarship students maintained 
by the Central Government of Porto Rico, the legislative assembly, 
at its last session, empowered the municipalities of the island, under 
certain restrictions, to maintain scholarship students in the colleges 
and universities of the United States out of their own funds. As 
yet no students have been sent to the United States under this law, 
but a list of the higher institutions in the United States giving the 
courses prescribed by the bill has been sent to the municipal councils 
by the commissioner of education, and it seems probable that some 
students may be sent to the United States under this bill during the 
coming school year.    
   
        
               
                   
      
   
       TEACHERS’ CONFERENCES. 
During the past year 179 conferences of teachers have been held 
throughout the island, with an average attendance of 989 teachers, 
an average of 4.3 conferences per district, with 23 teachers in attend- 
ance at each. In addition there have been held a large number of 
smaller meetings of teachers for the purpose of discussing in greater 
detail the work of certain grades. 
The programs sent in to the department denote a distinct tendency 
to avoid pedantic discussions and to get down to the real problems 
that confront teachers in classroom work. The topics are few enough 
in number, so that each one may receive thorough consideration. 
Especial interest has been aroused this year by the introduction of 
experience meetings, question boxes, and round-table discussions.
-P-A-G-E-453
  EDUCATION IN PORTO RICO. 433 
An important feature of this year’s teachers’ conferences has been 
the continuance of the model class conducted by a normal graduate 
or by one of the stronger teachers. Weaker and less experienced 
teachers thus have an opportunity to observe the practical application 
of the best methods and to learn how to improve their own work. 
As a rule the conferences are conducted wholly in English, for the 
majority of the teachers are steadily acquiring facility in the use of 
the language and welcome every opportunity for practice. There is, 
however, no requirement as to the language to be used. The greatest 
importance is attached in these conferences to the interchange of 
ideas in a free and thorough discussion, regardless of the medium of 
expression. 
Whenever it has been possible a member of the department has 
been present at the teachers’ conferences to assist in the discussions 
and to promote the sentiment of solidarity throughout the school 
system. Athletic contests, competitive drill of the cadets, baseball 
games, picnics, and informal social functions have frequently been 
held during the year at the time of the'conferences. The meetings 
sometimes take the form of a literary contest between different towns 
and include speeches by representative citizens, 
INSTRUCTION IN ENGLISH. 
English as a medium of instruction in the various branches of the 
common-school curriculum was first introduced during the year 
1905-6, when 74 schools were taught entirely in this language. Since 
its introduction there has been a widespread interest in the English 
language and a very general desire on the part of both pupils and 
parents to have the schools conducted entirely in English wherever 
possible. In accordance with this desire the number of schools to 
be taught with English as a medium of instruction has increased 
gradually year by year. This growth is evident from the following 
statement :

Before the opening of the school year 1909-10 no rural schools were 
taught wholly in English. During that year 124 rural teachers, at 
their own request, were given permission by their supervising princi-

-P-A-G-E-454
    
434 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
pals to conduct all their classes in English. The results were so 
satisfactory that during the past year the number of rural schools 
conducted wholly in English was increased to 154. 
During the coming school year over 550 Porto Rican teachers who 
hold the English graded license will impart instruction in the various 
branches of the graded-school curriculum entirely in English, as com- 
pared with 449 the preceding year. The use of English as a medium 
of instruction has developed to such an extent in the graded schools 
that at the present time there is not a single one in the island in 
which no English is taught, and only three in which instruction in the 
different branches is given in Spanish with English as a special 
subject. 
The result obtained in the use of English in our schools is all the 
more noteworthy as it has been brought about largely through the 
efforts of the Porto Rican teachers, who have rapidly qualified them- 
selves to teach in English through constant effort, attendance at the 
summer institutes, and by ‘ahins: the course of English offered by the 
department during the school year. 
SCHOOL CELEBRATIONS. 
The custom of celebrating legal and school holidays has always 
been observed in the Porto Rican schools and during the past year 
the celebrations were unusually successful. Parents do not visit the 
schools as a rule, especially since the instruction in graded schools is 
in English and not intelligible to the most of them. The school enter- 
tainments, however, serve not only to impress upon the children the 
ideas and ideals inherent in the day itself but also to provide a suit- 
able occasion for parents to come into closer contact with school work 
and its motives. 
Thanksgiving Day, Arbor Day, celebrated the day following 
Thanksgiving, and Washington’s Birthday, are observed as holidays 
in all the schools. To these have been added Tuberculosis Day, the 
Friday before the day designated by the governor as Tuberculosis 
Sunday, and Memorial Day. Parents’ Day is celebrated at some 
time near the close of the year, no special date being fixed by the 
department. On this day model classes and exhibits of work are 
given special prominence, the intention being to let the parents see 
the actual progress the pupils have made in their work. Parents’ 
Day has been well received and now has its recognized place among 
school celebrations. 
The celebration of the other holidays was carried on in the usual 
manner, the exercises consisting of selections, songs, and addresses 
by prominent citizens.

SUMMER INSTITUTES. 
The experience of this summer has proved that there is a real 
demand for summer institutes. The teachers have responded in 
large numbers and the enrollment this year is larger than ever be- 
fore; in fact is too large to be handled well with the equipment and 
corps of teachers available. The enrollment at Rio Piedras on July 
31 was 391 and at Ponce 333. 
One of the most encouraging features of the institutes this sum- 
mer is the attitude of deep interest and industry with which the 
teachers view their work. They have come to work, and the differ- 
ence is felt by both teacher and student. 
Another encouraging feature is the large proportion of teachers 
with graded or English graded licenses who are enrolled. It was 
feared at first that these institutes might develop into a sort of 
training school for those who were preparing to pass examinations 
for a higher grade of license. The English graded teachers consti- 
tute about one-fourth of the number enrolled this summer, and a 
very small per cent of them are planning to take the examination for 
the principal’s license. The great majority are there simply for the 
sake of self-improvement. 
SCHOOL LIBRARIES. 
The library movement, inaugurated about January 1, 1909, had 
resulted by the end of that year in a total of 81 libraries with 9,038 
volumes in rural and graded schools. The figures for the year just 
closed are 239 libraries with a total of 39,716 volumes. Only seven 
municipalities are without libraries in their graded schools, and only 
four without libraries in either graded or rural schools. In addition 
to school libraries, there are in the island 10 libraries open to the gen- 
eral public, containing 23,297 volumes. The largest of these is the 
Insular Library in San Juan, supported by insular funds and con- 
taining about 15,000 volumes. This makes a grand total of 65,013 
volumes accessible to the school children throughout the island. In 
a number of towns funds have been raised for school libraries by giv- 
ing school fiestas or entertainments. 
The graded-school libraries are in most cases kept in one of the 
schoolrooms, which is open to the pupils for reading and study for a 
couple of hours each evening, usually in charge of a teacher. This 
has had a decided influence in securing better school work as well as 
in keeping the children off the streets at night. The careful reading 
of a story book in English can but ‘result in a more rapid acquisition 
of the language and a better understanding of school work.

436 - EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
SCHOOL PLAYGROUNDS. 
Since the playground movement in the various towns of the island 
was instituted by the Department of Education in 1908 steady prog- 
ress has been made. The municipal councils have very generously co- 
operated in the movement by donating land to the school boards in 
many instances and by providing funds for equipment. In many 
instances private individuals and corporations have demonstrated 
their desire to give the Porto Rican children an opportunity for spon- 
taneous play by giving either apparatus or money and donating or 
giving the use of land so that the children could enjoy free out-door 
exercise without danger from passing vehicles. In several towns the 
school boards bought land for the playground. The public plazas in 
a few towns have been changed into recreation centers through the 
kindness of the municipal authorities. At the present time very few 
towns of the island have not provided in some way a place for the 
boys and girls to play, and more or less apparatus. 
For the most part the apparatus used in the playgrounds has been 
made of native wood by local carpenters. This has made the first 
cost of the equipment very low as compared with the prices of steel 
apparatus, and also reduced the cost of transportation to a minimum. 
A number of school boards have, however, provided large play- 
grounds fully equipped with the most modern steel apparatus, and, 
as the cost of keeping the home-made apparatus in repair is consid- 
erable, it would seem advisable to purchase steel equipment wherever 
the school boards have sufficient available money. 
In six towns—San Juan, Rio Piedras, Humacao, Santa Isabel, 
Yauco, and Manati—teachers with special training have supervised 
the children while at play. In all other muicipalities acting princi- 
pals, teachers of English, or graded-school teachers have cooperated 
heartily in providing a pleasant and profitable pastime for their 
pupils outside of class hours. 
The playgrounds have been open, as a rule, before and after school 
hours and during recesses. In at least one town the children are 
allowed to utilize the playground during the evening on moonlight 
nights. 
The establishment of playgrounds in connection with the country 
rural schools is an encouraging feature of the movement in favor of 
the physical welfare of the Porto Rican children. In several munici- 
palities playgrounds with good equipment have been provided for all 
rural schools in the district, and the number of rural playgrounds 
will increase rapidly in the next few years. As most rural schools 
have double enrollment, the children who receive instruction in the 
forenoon can devote the afternoon hours to natural play in the open  
-P-A-G-E-457
    EDUCATION IN PORTO RICO. 437 
air, and those who attend school in the afternoon have the forenoon 
hours for exercising their muscles. 
Our national game of baseball continues to hold first place as a 
group game for the Porto Rican boys. There is hardly a town with- 
out its baseball team, and in some districts teams have been formed 
by boys in the rural schools and interesting games are played with 
the graded-school team. Contests between teams of adjoining mu- 
nicipalities have been more frequent during the past year than in 
former years, and in every instance a hearty spirit of rivalry has 
prevailed. 
The annual athletic meet for boys of the high and grammar schools 
of the island was held March 24 and 25, 1911, at the new athletic 
field at Ponce. Thousands of parents and children occupied the 
grand stands, and great enthusiasm was displayed during the two 
days’ contest. The Ponce school band furnished music throughout 
the contests, and winners and losers alike left the field in the best 
of spirits. 
SCHOOL BUILDINGS. 
There has been no decrease in the interest shown in past years by 
the school boards and the department in the erection of school build- 
ings. Every effort is made to lessen the number of rented school- 
rooms, and as rapidly as the resources of the school boards permit new 
buildings are erected. In the past year some half dozen school boards 
have taken the steps necessary to obtain a loan from the Insular Gov- 
ernment with which to build schools and in this manner do away 
with the payment of excessive rents. 
At the present time there are owned by the people of Porto Rico 
and used exclusively for school purposes 89 graded and 234 rural 
schoolhouses, as compared with 64 graded and 174 rural schoolhouses 
in 1907. 
At the last legislative session there was appropriated another 
$40,000 to further the work begun by the appropriation of a like 
amount in 1908. From this “school-building fund” school boards 
may obtain a sufficient amount to pay for the cost of a building of 
the size warranted by the school population and repay half or other 
proportion of the cost at a low rate of interest. The construction of 
the cheaper buildings of the price of $250 is still carried on, and of the 
$40,000 set aside for this purpose $30,833.86 has been spent to date. 
There is a promising outlook for the construction of a great num- 
ber of good houses during the coming year, and it is hoped that 
within the next three years every one of the 68 municipalities will 
own its own school buildings.

438 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
ORIGINAL RESEARCH. 
For the first time in its history the Department of Education has 
given its attention in a modest way to certain studies in the field of 
original research—first, to a study of ethnology, and, second, to a 
study of folklore. So far nothing has been accomplished along the 
line, and perhaps will not be, by the Department of Education, yet a 
mass of material is being collected which, placed in the hands of com- 
petent students, can not fail to be of great value. The department is 
in official touch directly with 2,000 or more teachers and, through 
them, with 150,000 pupils, representing practically every family in 
the island. It is not strange, then, that with such an advantage the 
department is able, more perhaps than any other organization, to 
come in touch with the people as a whole and learn from them con- 
ditions and customs in even the remotest part of the island. The 
first step in the ethnological study was the issue of a circular letter 
to supervising principals of the island directing them to report: 
First. The exact location and a more or less detailed description of any evi- 
dences in situ of Indian occupation or activity within your district. Such evi- 
dences would consist of burial mounds, playgrounds or athletic fields, shell 
heaps, pictographs, excavations, or any other Indian construction which because 
of its character has been too large to remove and is consequently still in posi- 
tion. Under.these headings please report the slightest traces or the most im- 
perfect examples as well as the best. 
Second. As complete a list as possible of Indian relics now owned by individ- 
uals within your district, and, if possible, a statement as to whether the pieces 
thus owned— 
1. Would be donated to the Insular Library and Museum. 
2. Would be loaned. 
8. Could be purchased; and if so, what would be the price. Such relics could 
consist of axes, spearheads, knives, collars, idols, balls, or any other piece plainly 
of Indian origin. 
  As the result of the circular letter, reports have been received from 
the 40 supervising principals, and the returns are being tabulated 
and a map constructed showing the existence of ethnological evi- 
dences throughout the island. 
The second study mentioned, that of folklore, in the form of songs 
and ballads, was made possible through the generosity of Mrs. F. R. 
Hoisington, of New York City, which enabled the department to 
offer prizes to the pupils of the public schools for the largest and 
most meritorious collections of “canciones antiguas de Espaiia y 
Puerto Rico.” The prizes are of $25, $15, $10, and $5, respectively, 
for the four leading collections. The following are desired: 
1. The ballads that are old and of Porto Rican or Spanish origin. 
2. The name of the person signing them or telling them, and as much infor- 
mation as possible as to the origin of both. words and music. For instance,
-P-A-G-E-459
    
EDUCATION IN PORTO RICO. 439 
whether the song is founded on fact or whether the air is by a Porto Rican 
musician, and if the author of the words is known. 
3. Especially wanted are the songs sung by the blind men of Porto Rico, to 
the guitar and guichero accompaniment. 
4, Songs sung by mothers and nurses to children. 
Already many of the districts of the island have signified their 
intention to enter this competition, and it seems probable that much 
valuable material will be forthcoming.

  CHAPTER XIII. 
EDUCATION IN THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS. 
[An abridgment of the annual report for 1909-10 of Frank R. White, Director of Education for the Philippine Islands.] 
The plan of action of the Philippine Bureau of Education contem- 
plates the constant attendance in school of at least one-third the school 
population of the islands, in the belief that by normal rotation of 
attendance the present generation may be made literate and given 
the first essentials of an education within 10 years. Maturity is 
reached at an early age in the Philippines, and of the present total 
Christian population of 7,293,997, about one-sixth, or 1,215,666, may 
be said to represent the legitimate school population. The average 
monthly enrollment for the year was 427,165—considerably in excess 
of the proposed average. An effective compulsory attendance law is 
necessary to prevent irregularity of attendance, but no extension of 
the school system to provide for a greater number than the present 
enrollment is possible with the money now available. 
The irregular attendance is due, not to an absence of real interest 
or confidence in the schools, but to a lack of appreciation of the neces- 
sity of punctuality and regularity, resulting in part from the con- 
ditions that prevailed in Spanish times. Instruction then was given 
in small schools and teaching was individual rather than by class. A 
child might enter or leave school at will without apparent loss. Un- 
der the present organization, however, a pupil who is irregular fails 
to advance with the others. The people are coming to realize the 
desirability of regular attendance and the statistics show steady im- 
provement, but a well-formulated compulsory law is nevertheless 
needed. 
AMERICAN TEACHERS. 
Seven hundred and thirty-two American teachers are in the employ 
of the bureau, and 283 of them are serving as supervising principals. 
The area assigned to each principal varies greatly, but averages over 
800 square miles; the number of Filipino teachers under each varies 
as much as the territory and may be from 5 or 6 to 40 or 50. The 
present policy is to confine the attention of the American supervisors 
to districts of such extent that they will be able not only to super- 
vise, but to give considerable actual instruction to teachers and to do 
some model teaching. Their districts are growing larger, however, 
441
-P-A-G-E-462
    
442 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
because the number of competent men is limited, and it is considered 
wiser to increase their area rather than to lower the standard of work 
by designating mediocre or inefficient men for such positions. 
The method of selecting teachers upon written recommendations 
has not proved satisfactory, and in every group of new teachers 
arriving from the States several—sometimes as many as one-fifth 
the whole number—have shown themselves at once to be incapable 
of success, either because of personal uncouthness or some crudity: 
amounting in individual cases to simple ignorance. It is contem- 
plated therefore to send a trusted official of the bureau to the United ~ 
States to act as appointing agent. All appointments will then be 
made as a result of personal investigation and inspection, and it is 
expected that only men and women of superior qualifications will be 
brought into the service. 
FILIPINO TEACHERS. 
Of the 8,275 Filipino teachers employed, 1,010 are paid by the 
Insular Government, 7,120 by municipalities, and 145 are appren- 
tices without pay. The average compensation of the insular teachers 
is 44.66 pesos per month; of municipal teachers, 18.29 pesos. The 
legislature has authorized a more liberal salary schedule for the 
teachers on the insular rolls, and their number will be reduced by 
eliminating those who are least worthy of the distinction. Very 
interesting and valuable data have been gathered relating to the 
qualifications of the Filipino teachers, and it is evident that they 
are advancing in efficiency. It will be the policy of the Bureau of 
Education in the future to assign to the Filipino teachers with special 
preparation the most responsible work of which they are capable. 
Those especially who have been educated in the United States and in 
the insular normal and trade schools will have the widest possible 
opportunity to exercise all the ability that they possess. 
COURSES OF INSTRUCTION. 
The primary and intermediate courses have been revised during 
the year, and the practical trend of the primary courses has been 
extended with even greater stress to the higher grades. 
The primary course covers 4 years, and from the first emphasis is 
laid upon industrial work. Each pupil must take in each grade two 
industrial courses, which include weaving, gardening, woodworking, 
modeling, lace making, basketry, pottery, sewing, embroidery, poultry 
raising, and domestic science. The usual scholastic branches are not

EDUCATION IN THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS. 443 
neglected, for the industrial work requires only from 30 to 60 
minutes daily, according to grade. 
The intermediate course occupies the fifth, sixth, and seventh years. 
The daily session is of 6 hours, divided usually into 8 periods of 40 
minutes each, with rest periods. Six courses are arranged, namely, 
a general course, a course for teaching, a course in farming, a trade 
course, a course in housekeeping and household arts, and a course for 
business. 
In the general course, industrial subjects similar to those of the 
primary grades receive three double periods per week in each grade, 
the remaining time being given to academic instruction, drawing, and 
agriculture. 
The course for training teachers contains in addition to the aca- 
demic branches, one year’s work in the native arts which form the 
basis of the industrial work in the primary schools, one year’s work 
in agriculture anid gardening, and one year of elementary normal 
instruction. This course, pursued by a sufficiently mature student, is 
expected to produce a competent primary school teacher. 
The course in farming is, with a few modifications, the course pre- 
scribed for the various ehitol farms that are conducted by the Bureau 
of Education. The academic studies are substantially the same as 
for the general course, but are correlated in every way possible with 
farm work and farm life. In Grade VI two double periods each 
week are given to carpentry, and in Grade VII similar time is allot- 
ted to blacksmithing. Three periods daily are given to farm work 
in Grade V and VI, and four periods daily in Grade VII. 
In the trade course almost half the time is devoted to work in the 
shops. For the present the academic work is similar to that of the 
general course. 
The course in housekeeping and household arts is given to girls in 
the schools in which the trade course is given to boys, and may be 
given elsewhere if the facilities permit. The essential subjects of 
the course are coyered in an elementary way in the general course, 
and to a small extent in the course for teaching. 
The course for business was outlined to meet the incessant demand 
for young men and women who can speak and write English, keep 
accounts, and use a typewriter. 
The secondary course, covering four years, is now undergoing 
revision, particularly with respect to English, science, and economics. 
The Philippine Normal School, while similar in standard to the 
general high-school course, gives preparation for teaching. Second- 
ary instruction is given in the School of Arts and Trades also, in 
coordination with shopwork.

444 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
TEXTBOOKS AND BULLETINS. 
The textbook problem is a perennial one in Philippine school ad- 
ministration. In the early years of American occupation the only 
English tests available for school use were such as are ordinarily em- 
ployed in the public schools of the United States. For many reasons 
they are wholly unsuited to use in these islands. 
The primer and readers contain much of the changes of seasons of 
a temperate country, and of fruits and flowers and birds which have 
never been seen or heard of there; of a home life and social customs 
which are beyond the experience and comprehension of children of the 
Tropics. The arithmetics deal with weights and measures unknown 
in the Orient; their problems are based on the buying and selling of 
products in which these pupils have no interest. The geographies 
are descriptive of North America and the States of the Union; they 
ignore the home of the Filipino, and give scant treatment to the 
Orient in general. The histories deal with America and Europe, 
making no mention of the Philippine Islands, and little of China, 
Japan, and Malaysia. The texts on nature study and animal life 
tell the child of a vegetation and a fauna which are as strange to the 
Filipino as German script is to a boy or girl in an American primary 
school. However, in course of years, by selecting the best books pre- 
sented the bureau has finally secured a consistent system of primary 
texts, well printed, well illustrated, strongly bound, attractive in 
general appearance, and admirably adapted to the experience and 
needs of the Filipino children. Several very excellent intermediate 
books have also been prepared. 
During the past year the need for other texts and manuals in cer- 
tain special lines has been evident. In the absence of any other suit- 
able source of supply, several bulletins or manuals have been pre- 
pared, or are in process of preparation, by the bureau, after extended 
consultation by committees of superintendents and teachers best 
qualified to work. These manuals relate to school and home garden- 
ing, freehand and mechanical drawing, embroidery and lace making, 
domestic science, accounting, etc. 
INDUSTRIAL INSTRUCTION. 
The most important work to which the Bureau of Education has 
addressed itself during the past year has been the organization, pro- 
motion, and proper supervision of industrial instruction. 
In the Philippines, while various lines of industrial work have 
been introduced into the schools in the past, the present administra- 
tion, with the effectual assistance of a large portion of the field per- 
sonnel of the bureau, has been devoting itself to formulating and 
putting into operation a program of industrial instruction which

     shall be at once logical in its sequence from grade to grade and in 
close harmony with the industrial needs of the country. 
Considerable progress has been made in the introduction of indus- 
trial instruction. The present effort is in the direction of putting 
method and purpose into this teaching. So far as possible, the hand- 
work of every school is being commercialized; instruction in the 
minor industries will have in view the training of the pupil to make 
always a serviceable and salable article. The aim is to operate 
every trade school and every school farm on a business basis. Hand- 
work doubtless has considerable educative value in itself as a class 
exercise, but the present policy of the Bureau of Education in this 
connection is not so much to secure mere pedagogical results as it is 
to make the relation between this instruction and everyday industrial 
life as immediate and evident as possible. 
Industrial work of the schools as at present organized falls into 
four general divisions; namely, minor industries, gardening and field 
agriculture, trade and manual training work, and housekeeping and 
household arts. Some of these lines are followed through the sev- 
eral years of the elementary course. By reason of the expensiveness 
of equipment necessary in certain branches of the work and the lack 
of a sufficient force of trained teachers, the standard of instruction 
has not been fully attained or the desired results accomplished. 
However, in view of all conditions, the recent advance has been very 
satisfactory. 
Minor industries.—The opportunity for doing an interesting and 
original piece of work is perhaps greater in the development of local 
native industries than in any other line. Hand weaving can be un- 
dertaken by the pupils at a very early age; even those enrolled in 
first grades may learn to make articles of real value. The possibili- 
ties of Philippine fibers are quite unknown. Unlimited quantities of 
various straws, grasses, and sedges, and different varieties of rattan 
and bamboo are available almost everywhere; abacé, maguey, cotton, 
pifia, kapok, coir, cabo-negro, pasao, buri balangot, and ticog can be 
obtained by little labor and frequently with no expenditure of money. 
Articles of simple workmanship may be produced from these com- 
mon materials with wide opportunity for the exercise of taste in 
selection. Baskets of bamboo and buri can be made even by the 
youngest pupils. Through the normal progress from simple to more 
difficult weaves and patterns, pupils proceed to the manufacture of 
hats, mats, slippers, book covers, book satchels, baskets, hand bags, 
rays, hammocks, picture frames, curtains, cushions, and other use- 
ul and salable products. It is believed that in time this plan will 
esult in the development of a large body of skilled workers who will 
e able not only to improve the facilities and attractiveness of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-466
    446 — EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
home, but also to promote local industries which will enter into the 
world’s trade. 
As an illustration of the possibilities of this situation, attention is 
invited to the hat-making industry as it now exists in the Philippines. 
Four valuable varieties of hats are manufactured—the Buntal, the 
Sabutan, the Baliuag, and the Calasiao—all of which require the 
exercise of great patience and skill in the making. They are made 
from fibers which are common throughout the islands, but each 
variety of hat is produced in only a single community or within a 
restricted area. All of these hats, if made in acceptable styles, would 
find a large market in the United States. A single Manila dealer 
has recently received orders for a million Philippine hats. He is 
absolutely unable to fill these orders in any measure, simply because 
the product is inadequate in quantity. The public schools are giving 
constant attention to this matter of hat weaving, and there is no 
question that within a comparatively brief period the number of 
persons skilled in this art may be so increased as to materially affect 
the trade of the country. 
Gardening and field agriculture-—Gardening is prescribed for 
every primary school. In nearly all divisions a serious effort has 
been made to meet this requirement, and an increase in the number of 
school gardens has resulted, 1,684 being reported for the year—an 
average of about 50 for each Province. Among the varied products 
are corn, gabi, colis, onions, tomatoes, radishes, eggplants, beans, 
peppers, sweet potatoes, lettuce, cabbage, garlic, squashes, and 
pechay. In many communities the product of the school and home 
gardens has become a considerable factor in the daily ration of the 
people. Vegetables are now commonly grown in larger quantities 
and greater variety than formerly, a fact which indicates that this 
particular phase of industrial work has been productive of good 
results. 
The experience of the bureau with school farms has not been exten- 
sive, nor have the results been altogether satisfactory. Twelve sites 
in all have been surveyed for such institutions, comprising 1,634 hec- 
tares. Many of these are admirably situated, fertile, and adapted 
to the cultivation of the varied products of the islands. On these 
sites are 26 temporary buildings used as classrooms, tool sheds, and 
dormitories. 
The task of standardizing school farms is still in the experimental 
stage; no type has yet been fixed upon as wholly satisfactory. One 
of the most promising is that which is being developed at Batac, 
Tlocos Norte. This farm consists of 6} hectares and is operated i 
connection with an intermediate school. Last year 80 boys worke 
on the land an average of about 24 hours daily. They maintain 
52 garden plots and planted and harvested creditable amounts o:

   rice, tobacco, peanuts, and corn. The equipment of this farm is 
inexpensive. 
Steps have been taken toward the introduction of sericulture in 
several Provinces. During the year Filipino teachers from various 
divisions were sent to the Bureau of Science in Manila for a brief 
course of instruction in the several processes of silk production. 
Mulberry cuttings have been, and are still being, sent by that bureau 
and the Bureau of Agriculture to favorable points in various parts 
of the islands for planting. At the Batac school farm a substantial 
building with cement floor has been constructed for use in this con- 
nection, and the necessary racks, trays, and other equipment have 
been provided. Five hundred mulberry trees are growing on the 
premises. In Cavite, Cagayan, Cebu, Pampanga, and Pangasinan 
this industry is also receiving attention in the schools. 
The Bureau of Education recognizes as one of its legitimate func- 
tions the teaching of practical agriculture, but it is not an experi- 
mental bureau. It is not its business to undertake to demonstrate 
when there is any doubt as to the successful result of the demonstra- 
tion. As to what to plant in this country and how to plant it, care 
for it, and harvest it, the Bureau of Education may properly, and 
does, look to the Bureau of Agriculture for advice and instruction. 
The Bureau of Agriculture is the agency of the Government which 
is supposed to understand best all the difficulties of this peculiar 
situation and to be best able to advise as to how those difficulties may 
be met in a practical way. - 
Trade and manual training schools——During the past year a some- 
what close distinction has been drawn between the terms “manual 
training school” and “trade school.” It is believed that the trade 
school is the type of institution needed here rather than the manual 
training school. As rapidly as possible the woodworking shops con- 
mected with provincial high schools are being reorganized and estab- 
lished as practical institutions upon a business basis. The trade 
school of Hoilo is typical of what the bureau is undertaking in this 
ine. It is a self-supporting institution where students earn enough 
o support themselves while securing their training by manufacturing 
rticles of commercial value. House building has recently been 
dded to the course of instruction of that school, and certain advanced 
upils are now constructing, under contract, a bungalow to cost 
bout 3,000 pesos. 
Preliminary and preparatory to the work of both these classes of 
mstruction is tool work in the primary grades. The number of pri- 
ary schools in which woodworking was offered during the past year 
as 158, with 6,335 pupils engaged in the work. It is the purpose to 
Itimately introduce it into all higher primary grades throughout the 
lands. In the intermediate grades the boys are required to com- 
 
-P-A-G-E-468
    448 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
plete a series of prescribed exercises in woodworking. When a 
measure of proficiency has been attained school furniture and equip- 
ment for the home are commonly manufactured. 
There are now 35 provincial trade and manual training schools 
equipped with woodworking tools; 25 of these have been supplied 
with woodworking machinery, a few are provided with blacksmithing 
outfits, and 1 with a small set of ironworking machinery. These 
equipments are sufficiently complete to warrant the placing of the 
schools upon a commercial footing when the pupils have reached the 
required standard of proficiency and provincial funds are available 
for the support of the institution upon the preferred basis. About 
6,126 boys received regular instruction last year in these institutions. 
Housekeeping and household arts—In the primary course instruc- 
tion in so-called domestic science includes elementary sewing and 
the cooking of simple dishes of the country upon native stoves. This 
instruction was given last year in 527 schools to 12,603 girls. Lace 
making and embroidery have recently been added to the course of 
study as optional subjects. These latter industries are believed to be 
susceptible of very extensive and profitable development in the 
Philippines. Many of the women and girls throughout the Proy- 
inces have received some instruction in these lines in the convents. 
Because of their great natural aptitude for this sort of work, their 
patience, and delicacy of execution, the Filipino women are consid- 
ered among the most skillful workers in the world in these arts, their 
product being classed by experts as even superior to that of the French 
and the Swiss. These are essentially household arts, however, carried 
on independently under crude conditions, without system, and fre- 
quently following ancient models with no attention to modern de- 
mands. The work needs to be systematized, the girls instructed with 
reference to modern style and trained to use suitable materials. 
Indeed, much has already been accomplished -in this direction in the 
schools of Manila, Albay, and one or two other divisions. 
In the intermediate course instruction in housekeeping and house- 
hold arts was given in 117 schools to 3,857 girls. The course includes 
sewing, cooking, house sanitation, use of disinfectants, introduction 
of new and better food elements, care of the sick, and care of in- 
fants. In several Provinces model homes have been constructed in 
connection with the provincial high schools, and theoretical instruc- 
tion in housekeeping has been given in connection with actual train- 
ing in household duties. 
Industrial. teachers—The corps of American teachers in manual- 
training and trade schools is somewhat larger and more efficient tha 
it was a year ago, and the teachers of domestic science have also in 
creased in number and in familiarity with the requirements of th 
service. Instruction in the minor industries can be generally intro

duced into primary schools only through the medium of trained 
Filipino teachers. The work of manual-training and trade schools 
and domestic-science classes must be execedingly limited in scope 
if it is to be handled by Americans only. One of the most impor- 
tant obligations of the bureau at the present time is evidently the 
training of Filipino teachers in these special lines. The Philippine 
School of Arts and Trades, the Philippine Normal School, both in 
Manila, the various industrial schools throughout the islands, and the 
annual teachers’ institutes in all divisions are making it one of their 
chief aims to accomplish this purpose as speedily and efficiently as 
possible. 
SCHOOLHOUSE CONSTRUCTION. 
To meet the demand for permanent, sanitary schoolhouses the Bu- 
reau of Education last year adopted a set of standard plans for pro- 
vincial, central, and barrio schools of a type peculiarly adapted to the 
Tropics. 
The basic material of construction, as contemplated in the stand- 
ard plans, is reenforced concrete. With foundations and walls of 
concrete, the remaining parts of the building may be made up largely 
of local materials; the roof must be of iron. Reenforced concrete is 
now generally used in the construction of public buildings in the 
Philippines; for schoolhouses it offers advantages with which other 
materials can not compete. It makes the most permanent of build- 
ings, withstanding earthquakes and the severest storms; it can be 
handled, with proper supervision, by unskilled workmen; it offers a 
clean surface against disease germs and resists better than stone and 
mortar the attacks of termites and other insects. 
During the past few years appropriations have been made from 
time to time for the construction of intermediate, secondary, and 
trade schools, and the buildings for which the funds were allotted are 
all either finished or nearing completion. 
An appropriation has been secured for the construction of a new 
building for the academic work of the Philippine Normal School. 
Plans have been completed, and a splendid building will be con- 
structed in the central part of the city of Manila. This building is to 
be three stories in height, of reenforced concrete, and when completed 
will be one of the finest structures in the Philippine Islands. 
A large amount of construction has been made possible by Act No. 
1801 of the Philippine Legislature, passed on December 20, 1907, ap- 
propriating the sum of 1,000,000 pesos for primary-school buildings 
throughout the islands. To secure an allotment a sum equal to one- 
half of the amount apportioned from insular funds must be made up 
from municipal resources. As a matter of fact the municipalities 
13144°—xp 1911—vor 1——29 
   
-P-A-G-E-470
  450 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
have far exceeded the required municipal donation, .When this ap- 
propriation has been expended there will have been erected over 800 
modern school buildings of permanent construction, perfectly adapted 
to the climatic conditions of the Philippines—a system extending 
throughout the archipelago, from the capital to remote barrios, 
SCHOOLS OF GENERAL SCOPE. 
The Philippine Normal School has undergone reorganization dur- 
ing the past year. That institution was established in the early days 
of the Bureau of Education, and has been continuously under intelli- 
gent direction of competent superintendents. However, the aims of 
the school, over a period of years, gradually came to comprise the 
training of young men and women for various professional and 
academic careers other than teaching. Courses were established in 
preparation for the study of medicine, law, engineering, agriculture, 
and nursing, as well as for entrance into general collegiate work. 
In this field the institution doubtless served a good end, as there was 
no other school in the islands devoted to preparing students for 
these various professional studies. But the school reached such a 
state that its graduating classes included very few pupils prepared 
for teaching, but large and increasing numbers who were expecting 
to engage in other pursuits. The legitimate function of the normal 
school was in a measure overlooked. 
In effecting the needed reorganization the normal school proper, 
with its primary and intermediate training departments, its indus- 
trial classes for young men and women, and its academic work of high- 
school standard, was set apart as an independent institution with a 
separate corps of teachers; and the large number: of special students 
were grouped under another organization and faculty, known as the 
Junior College. Only such students were continued in the normal 
- school as were definitely intending to devote their lives to teaching, 
and the instructors were advised to turn their whole effort to improv- 
ing the native teaching corps of the islands. The field has been 
brought into touch with the school, which, as reorganized, constitutes 
a far more effective department of the Bureau of Education than 
ever before. : 
The Philippine School of Arts and Trades, an insular institution 
coordinate with the normal school, has likewise experienced a growth 
in the past year, but it has not been subjected to any general reor- 
ganization. It comprises departments .of bench woodworking, ma- 
chine woodworking, wood finishing, machine ironworking, black- 
smithing, wheelwrighting, automobile repairing, mechanical draw- 
ing, and academic work. The value of the manufactured product of 
the students of this institution for the year ending June 30, 1910, was 
21,837.72 pesos. 
 
-P-A-G-E-471
    EDUCATION IN THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS. 451 
In the normal schcol, the trade school, and the college of agricul- 
ture, the Bureau of Education maintained last year 222 scholarship 
students. Of this number 88 were so-called “student pensionados,” 
who, before appointment, had advanced in academic qualifications to 
at least the third year of the prescribed high-school course. They 
were all enrolled in the normal school. The remaining number were 
distributed among the three institutions above named and were so- 
called “teacher pensionados;” that is, each must have taught fer a 
pericd of two years in the public schools before appointment to Gov- 
ernment pension. Ail of these scholarship students accept appoint- 
ment under contract to serve the Government as teachers for a time 
equal to the period during which they are maintained as students 
at Government expense. This scholarship system is a very advan- 
tageous arrangement for the Bureau of Education in the present 
status of its work. It provides means for the training of a large 
number of selected young men and women for the teaching profession. 
It gives opportunity to many faithful and efficient Filipino teachers 
to continue their studies and so increase their value to the Govern- 
ment, when otherwise they would in time necessarily be replaced by 
younger men and women more advanced in scholarship but inex- 
perienced in teaching. Furthermore, this system will enable the 
Bureau of Education to develop various lines of industrial instrue- 
tion much more rapidly than would otherwise be possible. Every 
scholarship student in the normal school, in addition to receiving 
needed instruction in academic and normal subjects, is trained in some 
specialty, as loom weaving, hat weaving, sewing, cooking, lace mak- 
ing, embroidery, or music; those in the trade school are given definite 
preparation for service in the field as teachers of woodworking in 
primary schools and as assistants in provincial school shops; those de- 
tailed to the college of agriculture receive training both technical and 
practical, in preparation for teaching the subject of their specialty in 
intermediate and high schools. 
The Insular School of Commerce, at Manila, was transferred early 
in the year from inadequate quarters to a large, finely situated build- 
ing on Calle General Solano. The enrollment for the school year was 
395. One of its departments has undertaken what promises to be an 
exceedingly valuable work in collaboration with the general office in 
the collecting of accurate and extensive data on present industria 
conditions throughout the Philippines. 
The Scheol for Deaf and Blind enrolled 19 pupils, as many as could 
well be cared for. 
CONVENTIONS AND ASSEMBLIES. 
The Teachers’ Vacation Assembly, with its eamp in the Baguio 
hills, has become an established institution. The session of the assem- 
bly proper began on April 11 and clesed on May 7, but the camp 
   
-P-A-G-E-472
    
452 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
was not broken until May 21. During the session 215 superintend- 
ents, teachers, and others: connected with the bureau enjoyed the 
benefits of the invigorating climate of this mountain country and of 
the lectures, entertainments, and conferences which made up the pro- 
gram of the assembly. Classes were conducted by competent instruc- 
tors in lace making, embroidery, science of education, Spanish, and 
Philippine history. Probably the most valuable feature of the year’s 
session was comprised in the series of conferences of supervising 
teachers, high-school principals, and industrial instructors. There 
have been in former years conventions of division superintendents, 
in which the problems of the field have been discussed by them and 
the directors of education from the standpoint of the superintending 
and directing force. Opportunity for discussion of these problems 
by the teachers themselves was never before officially offered, how- 
ever. Most of the conferences were largely attended; the benefits 
both to the instructors and to the directors present were of undoubted 
value. 
A number of Filipino teachers from the schools of the city of 
Manila attended the assembly at Baguio, entering largely into the 
life of the camp and apparently enjoying its benefits. 
There was convened in Manila an institute for Filipino teachers 
at the Normal School from April 18 to May 18. It was attended by 
785 teachers, representing nearly every Province in the archipelago. 
The instruction was made as*practical as possible, industrial sub- 
jects being taken up in a more business-like manner and with far 
better results than in any former gathering of teachers in the history 
of the bureau. In vacation classes of-the Philippine School of Arts 
and Trades, from April 11 to June 3, 105 teachers were enrolled, all 
being engaged in preparing themselves to-offer instruction in wood- 
working in primary classes. Large-summer institutes were convened 
also in Dumaguete and Iloilo for the benefit of teachers in the Visayan 
Islands. The aims and methods of these assemblies were similar to 
those of the institutes held in Manila. 
ATHLETICS. 
The year just passed witnessed a growing interest in school ath- 
letics; three interprovincial track and baseball meets took place. 
Such contests are now becoming well-organized annual events in 
various parts of the islands. The enthusiasm and good fellowship 
which characterize them have done much to bring about more cordial 
relations among neighboring Provinces. Everywhere they are train- 
ing into the Filipino youth a spirit of friendly rivalry and are dis- 
placing former questionable pastimes. 
Careful training for these meets is producing a better showing in 
all events, and in some the records are approaching standard athletic 
 
-P-A-G-E-473
    
EDUCATION IN THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS. 453 
marks. Aside from the organized meets, progressive schools in all 
divisions have their baseball teams and on their own initiative 
arrange and play games with neighboring schools. 
In intermediate classes, tennis for boys and girls and basket ball 
for girls are gaining favor as school recreations. For the coming 
year more ambitious gatherings are planned, and the carnival events 
for 1911 will doubtless include entries of well-organized teams from 
several sections of the archipelago, 
FILIPINO STUDENTS IN THE UNITED STATES. 
The number of students sent to the United States on Government 
scholarship is decreasing. The chief reason for this decrease lies in 
the fact that several institutions of higher education have now been 
established in the Philippines. In former years superior instruction 
could only be obtained abroad, but since the organization of the 
several branches of the university of the Philippines and certain 
special schools the needs of the higher student body can be better met 
in insular institutions than in the United States, where many of the 
conditions bearing directly upon instruction appropriate for these 
islands are unknown. 
AIMS OF THE BUREAU. 
The principal and most immediate aim of the bureau is, and prob- 
ably always will be, to make the largest possible number of the 
youth of the country literate in a common language. However, 
there are certain phases of the work of the bureau upon which espe- 
cial emphasis is to be placed during the coming year. 
In the development of industrial instruction the administration of 
the bureau is hampered by no embarrassing precedents; it has rea- 
sonably ample funds with which to execute its plans, and, best of all, 
it has in a most gratifying measure the moral support of both Ameri- 
cans and Filipinos in its attempt to build up a system of instruction 
which will promote the industrial efficiency and material well-being 
of the population. Such another opportunity probably never existed 
anywhere. It is perhaps not going too far to venture the assertion 
that within two or three years no State or National Government will 
have in practical operation a system of industrial instruction more 
consistent than that of the Philippines in its sequence through the 
various grades or more closely adapted to the material conditions 
and requirements of the country. 
With respect to schoolhouse construction the year 1910-11 is going 
to mark a greater advance than any preceding year in the history 
of the bureau. -The directing and superintending force of the bureau 
is devoting its energies most seriously to the building problem. Even  
-P-A-G-E-474
    454 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
if funds continue to be available as at present, it will take a decade 
to erect a system of buildings adequate to properly house the nearly 
5,000 schools now in operation. A large advance over the present 
situation can be effected, however, in a single year. It is desired to 
establish such a standard that the people of the provincial capital, 
the municipality, and the barrio shall look to the buildings of the 
public school as the most substantial and attractive structures in 
their respective districts. 
The Bureau of Education occupies a unique position among all 
the branches of the Government in that with its corps of superin- 
tendents, supervisors, and teachers it has nearly 10,000 employees in 
daily touch with almost half a million children, through whom its 
influence reaches into every town and every important barrio in the 
archipelago and touches every day, directly or indirectly, the major 
portion of the population of the islands. 
As a medium for dispensing general information with respect to 
the policies of the Government or upon any other subject of common 
interest this bureau is a valuable agency. 
Its cooperation has been freely given and with good effect: (1) To 
the Bureau of Health, in advising and instructing the people as to 
precautions against epidemics and upon sanitary measures generally. 
Especially earnest has been its participation in an organized cam- 
paign against tuberculosis. (2) To the Bureau of Agriculture, in 
advising the people as to the proper method of soil cultivation and 
as to the varieties of plants best adapted to the Philippines. (3) To 
the Bureau of Posts, in the establishment of the Postal Savings Bank. 
(4) To the Department of Justice, in spreading knowledge of the 
rights and duties of citizens in their relations to the Government and 
to each other. (5) To all the bureaus, in supplying them with young 
men and women trained as clerical assistants. The Bureau of Edu- 
cation has thus rendered valuable assistance to other departments of 
the Government, and it is now coming into a position where it can 
be of much greater help to them than ever before.

GOVERNMENT AND PUBLIC INSTRUCTION IN NETHER- 
LANDS-INDIA. 
By Davi P. Barrows, 
Professor of Political Science in the University of California. 
INTRODUCTION.” 
In the future administration of dependent peoples the public in- 
struction of the native population will overshadow other problems 
of empire. Colonial policies directed exclusively at material achieve- 
ment, and resting on the assumption that industrial development 
alone is sufficient to secure the contentment of the subject race, are 
representative of the past century rather than of the present.. The 
decades immediately before us will see such policies end either in 
disaster, as was the case with the reactionary Spanish policy in the 
Philippines, or in such thoroughgoing reorganization as will guar- 
antee the spiritual enlightenment of the colony and the preparation 
of its people for leadership. 
One of the first colonial powers to recognize the changed spirit 
of colonial undertakings was Holland. In the administration of her 
magnificent Empire of Netherlands-India there has begun an educa- 
tional expansion that promises to be one of the most significant fac- 
tors in the present history of colonial empire. For many years Hol- 
land has been the stock illustration of a colonial power that success- 
fully pursues a policy of commercial exploitation without regard to 
the intellectual and political advancement of the native peoples under 
domination. Recently—in fact, within five years—Holland has.so 
  1 Published information on the government of Netherlands-India, outside cf the Dutch 
language, is meager. M. Chailley-Bert's Java et ses habitants contains a suggestive and 
careful discussion of native instruction, written, however, before the recent significant 
changes in educational policy. Prof. Clive Day, in T’he Dutch in Java, skillfully sum- 
marizes the economic policy and disposes of current misconceptions of the “ culture 
system,” but barcly touches the question of native enlightenment. The Dutch public is 
served by able periodicals and reports devoted to colonial administration but the 
information there furnished rarely makes its way to English readers, The observations 
and statistics herein presented were, for the most part, furnished directly to the writer 
during a visit to Java in the fall of 1909. Grateful acknowledgment of information 
and invaluable assistance is made to His Excellency, Gov. Gen. Van Heutsz; to Dr. M. 8. 
Koster, director cf the department of instruction, worship, and industry; and to Mr. 
N. J. Verweij.

vadically modified her attitude on the subject of native instruction as 
to make her one of the leading countries with an educational program 
for her subject population. 
THE ISLANDS AND PEOPLES OF NETHERLANDS-INDIA. 
Next to the British Empire of India, the colonial possessions of the 
Dutch in Malaysia impress one as the greatest empire of dependent 
peoples in the world. The Dutch power in the East Indies extends 
unbrokenly from west to east for more than 3,000 miles. From the 
northwesterly point of Sumatra to the heart of New Guinea, where 
the sovereignty of Holland ends, is farther than from San Francisco 
to Baltimore. This territory embraces most of the important islands 
of the world that are held as colonial possessions. It includes the 
major part.of the two largest islands of the world, New Guinea and 
Borneo; the richest and most populous island in the world, Java; and 
the famed and long-coveted “Spice Islands,” the Moluccas, whose 
lure drew the Portuguese around Africa, launched the caravels of 
Columbus, and tempted the daring Magellan to find a new way 
around the world. These islands have been for more than 300 years 
in the tenacious grasp of Dutchmen and are still held without evi- 
dence of weakening power. 
Four-fifths of the Malay race inhabit islands under Dutch rule. 
Of the four colonial powers holding Malayan possessions, Great 
Britain governs 600,000 in the Malay Peninsula; France, approxi- 
mately 1,000,000 in Madagascar, with allied native races in Indo- 
China; the United States, 8,500,000 in the Philippines; and Hol- 
land, 40,000,000 in her Empire of Netherlands-India, of which num- 
ber nearly three-quarters, or 30,000,000, are on the single island of 
Java. Java has from the beginning been the seat of Dutch power. 
The most highly developed and most successfully administered of 
any part of the East Indies, the importance of this island in the 
Dutch system is shown by the organization of the Empire into two 
parts—Java and the “ Outer Possessions ” (Buitenbezittigen). The 
latter include the islands of Sumatra, with Banka, Billiton, and the 
little archipelago of Rhio south of Singapore, the greater part of 
Borneo, Bali, Lombok, Sumbawa, the western half of Timor, the 
island of Celebes, the Molukkas, Gilolo, Western New Guinea, and the 
small islands like the Ke and Aru groups, inhabited by black peoples, 
lying to the westward of New Guinea. These black or Papuan 
peoples add a second race to the natives under Dutch rule, but as their 
numbers are few and their culture low they present no problem of 
government such as is afforded by the numerous and diverse peoples 
of Malayan stock.

é DUTCH ADMINISTRATION. 
The administration of this vast Empire is strongly centralized. 
The executive and legislative authority over the entire Indies is 
vested in the Governor General, whose residence is at Batavia or at 
Buitenzorg, on the island of Java. The “Council of the Indies,” 
consisting of five men of high qualifications and long experience, acts 
as an advisory body. Native regents and rulers are appointed and 
may be deposed by the Governor General. He appoints Dutch regents 
and controleurs and all other officials, as well as the heads of the 
various departments which administer the affairs of the Empire. 
His legislative authority, under advice of the Council of the Indies, 
is limited only by the fundamental law of Netherlands-India, ie 
Regeerings-Reglement of 1848, or by other legislation of the States! 
General of Holland. 
Dutch administration has been developed to a remarkable degree of 
thoroughness and efficiency. A complete system of packet boats con- 
nects every port of the Indies, and flat-bottom steamers penetrate 
the shallow rivers even to the interior of Borneo. AI parts of this 
vast territory have regular communications with Batavia or Soura-. 
baya. The Dutch ale appears extremely effective. It is evident! 
everywhere. Its presence means the suppression of native feuds and 
violence, the opening of communications, the encouragement of agri> 
culture, and the protection of the native from injustice. For some 
years the peace of Netherlands-India has been undisturbed by rebel- 
lion. On the island of Celebes there have been some recent minor 
troubles with the still barbarous people, but elsewhere, since the sup- 
pression of the Achinese of northern Sumatra, Dutch rule has been 
peaceably enforced. 
EUROPEAN COLONISTS.* 
   
    
        
          
        
        
          Few colonies of the world can equal Netherlands-India in’ out- 
ward appearances of prosperity and well-being. The important 
towns of Java are beautifully situated, durably built, and splendidly 
furnished with public services. So considerable is the foreign popu+ 
lation in many of them that they seem in fact to be European com- 
munities set in the midst of tropical scenery and surroundings. They 
have comfortable hotels, clubs, parks, and private homes. 
The best newspapers of the Far East are published in Java in the 
Dutch language. They are excellently served by cable dispatches and 
correspondence from the countries of Europe and from the United 
States. The number of Dutch people resident in Netherlands-India 
is far larger than that of any other European nationality in the

Orient, even without the considerable element that is of mixed Dutch 
and Malay descent. Outside of the official class this population is 
mostly devoted to commerce and to planting, and in both pursuits 
its success compares more than favorably with that of residents in 
other European colonies. 
CHINESE AND ARABS. 
In addition to native Malay inhabitants there are two other non. 
European elements in the population. One of these is the Arab. 
Since the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, when Mohammedanism 
gained its first spiritual triumphs in Malaysia, there have been con- 
siderable numbers of Arab and kindred Mohammedan peoples in the 
confines of the Malay Archipelago. They are found settled in the 
Arab quarters of important ports like Batavia, Semarang, Soura- 
baya or Makassar, or journeying as traders and proselyters among 
the less important regions of the archipelago. Through their faith, 
which they have communicated to most of the Malay race, they 
possess an amount of influence over the population of Netherlands- 
India which is a source of some uneasiness to the Government. 
The other important foreign element is the Chinese, who are 
settling in nearly all the towns of the archipelago, although restricted 
as to dwelling and place of business to certain quarters. They num- 
ber about half a million, the majority of them residents of Java. 
A large proportion of them are married to native Malay women, or 
are the offspring of such marriages, and although the Chinese descent 
of a man may be remote and almost unapparent through predomi- 
nance of Malay blood, he remains in the legal status of the Chinese 
and subject to the disabilities of that race. In spite of restrictions 
placed upon them the Chinese have been immensely prosperous in 
Netherlands-India, and among their merchants and planters are to be 
found some of the wealthiest inhabitants of the colony. Much of the 
privately owned land of Java is in their possession. They own com- 
mercial establishments, banks, steamship lines, and other productive 
sources of wealth.    
     
          
   
          THR MALAYAN PEOPLES. 
The Malayan peoples, while of the common race, present. great 
differences of culture. The typical warlike, independent Malay finds 
his best type on the island of Sumatra, where the fertile and im- 
portant districts of Palembang and Menangkabau represent probably 
the centers of dispersal of the Mohammedanized Malays who founded| 
colonies and effected conquests in nearly all parts of the East Indies. 
Brunei, the Sulu Archipelago, and Manila had been settled by them 
previous to the arrival of the Spaniards. The northern part o 
Sumatra, as before stated, is inhabited by the warlike people, th
-P-A-G-E-479
  
INSTRUCTION IN NETHERLANDS-INDIA. 459 
Achinese. The island of Java is inhabited by three closely related 
Malayan peoples who speak different languages—the Sundanese in 
the western part of the island, particularly in the rich, elevated 
plateau of the Preanger Regencies; the Javanese in the center of the 
island; and the Madurese in the east and on the island of Madura. 
It was among the Javanese that the ancient Hindu civilization 
reached its highest development. The native kingdom of Majapahit 
flourished for centuries previous to the Mohammedan conquest, and 
finds its historic descendants in the present sultanates of Solo and 
Djokjakarta. This part of Java is covered with remarkable ruins 
of temples and shrines, which date from a thousand and more years 
ago. The most splendid of these is the famous Buddhist structure of 
Boro-Budur. 
The influence of this Hindu culture, which prevailed for-so long 
in Malaysia, is still present in the peoples of the Indian Archi; pelago 
and peta even to the Philippines. A considerable element in 
nearly all Malayan language is of Sanskrit origin. The religions 
of even the wild peoples are permeated with conceptions and deities 
that are clearly of Indian derivation, while many of the arts of life 
show an origin from India. The triumph of Mohammedanism on 
Java in the fourteenth century, and its unrelenting campaign against 
paganism of every kind, accomplished the suppression of Brahman- 
ism and Buddhism except upon the islands of Bali and Lombok. 
The population of Borneo is divided between primitive, pagan 
peoples and the Mohammedan Malays who dwell along the coast 
and on the banks of the rivers. In the southern part of Celebes are 
the Makassarese and the Bugis, who are Mohammedan, while in the 
extreme north, in the district of Minahasa, the natives are converts 
to Protestant Christianity, are exceptionally prosperous and docile, 
and have made great advances in civilization. Elsewhere on Celebes 
are peoples of different degrees of culture, including some of ex- 
ceedingly primitive life. On Amboyna the population is Christian, 
and on other islands of the Moluccas it has reached a state that may 
fairly be described as civilized. Further eastward the population 
is a mixed black and brown stock, loosely described as “Alfuros,” 
and from this type it merges into ne ‘relatively pure black Papuan 
or Melanesian. 
It will be seen from this brief Seca how diverse are the ele- 
ments which the Dutch Government must control and seek to advance 
in enlightenment and prosperity; a multiplicity of languages and 
dialects; a wide range of culture representing stages from savagery 
to civilization; the surviving influences of the civilizations of India, 
Islam, and Portugal, mingled with the early results of Dutch mis- 
sionaries and traders. Over practically all of this area standard 
“Malay,” a language of remarkable simplicity and flexibility, is     
             
         
  
-P-A-G-E-480

spoken by most natives, in addition to their local dialects. A knowl- 
edge of this “lingua franca” is indispensable to every European 
resident, and in addition every Dutch official and teacher must learn 
the dominant native dialect of the district in which his work lies. 
Thus a man will know Malay and also Sundanese, Bugis or Sangir, 
according as his work is in western Java, southern Celebes, or on the 
small but well-developed little islands north of Minahasa and south 
of the American possession of Mindanao.     
     
     
                                 
   
                 
       
   THE DUTCH COLONIAL SERVICE. 
The administrative force of Dutchmen who rule the destinies of 
these millions of brown people is, in every way, an exceptionally 
trained and experienced body. It is a profession for which are de- 
manded high qualifications, thorough training, and special prepara- 
tion. To this work a man devotes his life and powers unreservedly. 
The service is almost entirely recruited in Holland, as men of Dutch 
parentage in Netherlands-India seem generally to prefer the promis- 
ing opportunities afforded by planting or by business. Entrance to 
the service is through the “Great Functionary’s Examination,” and 
includes studies which have to do with the languages, geography, 
anthropology, resources, productions, economic conditions, adminis- 
trative system, civil law, and penal procedure of Netherlands-India. 
The examinations in native languages include the Malay and Java- 
nese. The candidates are graduates of a Dutch gymnasium or higher 
burgher school, who have had special technical preparation for the 
examination. The necessity for such special preparation for colonial 
service is thoroughly recognized in the Netherlands, as it is in Eng- 
land and in France, and the practice must be followed by every nation 
which expects to engage successfully in the government of dependent 
peoples. 
The first danger to every colonial service is the corruption and de- 
terioration of the official class. Against this tendency Holland ap- 
pears to be taking rigorous care. She selects her officers on the basis 
of a high and rigid civil-service examination. She puts great re- 
sponsibilities upon them, but she compensates them well, and seeks 
to provide them with associations and surroundings which will 
maintain their self-respect and their morale. The devotion of these 
men to their task appears to one experienced in observing men in 
similar situations to be of the highest order. Contrary to what is 
frequently stated, it appears that the official is taught to observe 
a kindly and considerate attitude toward the natives. 
The moral standard of the Dutch representatives in the Indies 
has greatly improved in recent years. Employees are encouraged 
to bring their families with them to the Indies. The Government 
pays all traveling expenses of wives and children and expenses of

      return on retirement and on the decennial furlough. Dutch officers 
are as temperate, certainly in the use of intoxicants, as are Americans 
or British representatives in the Orient. 
THE HISTORY OF DUTCH ENTERPRISE IN MALAYSIA. 
The history of the Dutch administration in Malaysia is not easy to 
present in brief summary. It covers more than 300 years. It began 
in the government of a chartered company, then became subject to 
personal rule of the monarch, and finally to the constitutional legis- 
lature of Holland. There have been sharp contrasts of policy. The 
motive behind the enterprise has changed from one period to an- 
other. The temper and policy of the administration of Netherlands- 
India to-day can not be judged from any description of 50 or 25 
years ago. 
Down nearly to the close of the eighteenth century Netherlands- 
India, while governed by the Dutch East India Co., was frankly 
the object of commercial gain. Wars were waged against native 
sultans and chieftains with the mere purpose of reducing them to 
a dependent and tributary position, but little interference was made 
in the local government, nor were the people protected from the ra- 
pacity and oppression of native rulers, whose tyranny increased in 
severity with the increased demands for tribute or “subsidies.” In 
spite of enormous profits gained during two centuries of enterprise 
under the chartered company, the end was financial bankruptcy and 
the assumption by the State of the power and responsibilities of em- 
pire. The reorganization of the colonial administration had not had 
time to assume-definite character when Holland was invaded by the 
forces of Napoleon, and for a term of years Netherlands and Nether- 
lands-India were elements of French Empire. There was sent out 
for the government of Java in 1807 a man whose name is still remem- 
bered by the Javanese for harsh and effective rule, Gen. Daendels. 
It was Daendels who first reorganized the colonial administration 
and made it a career. He built at heavy cost to native life the great 
military road that traverses the highlands of Java from one end of 
the island to the other, and which still stands as a monument to his 
ruthIss energy. He was more or less a type of the Napoleonic period. 
J. i811, Java and the other East Indian possessions fell before 
the invading forces of Lord Minto, the Governor General of India, 
land for a brief but very important period of six years were admin- 
istered by the remarkable young Englishman, Stamford Raffles. 
either Raffles’s character nor the quality of his service can be esti- 
ated here. Suffice it to say that whatever his defects, he supplied 
lements- previously lacking in the administration—humanity and 
ympathy forthe native population. His reforms have become per- 
nanent elements in the Government, and it is said that the Dutch
-P-A-G-E-482
    462 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
are still working to fully realize some of his advanced ideas. British 
rule ended in 1816, when Java was returned to Holland. The com- 
mission appointed by the Dutch Government to take back again 
the administration continued in a liberal spirit to carry forward the 
principles for which Rafiles’s administration had contended, but soon 
after, under pressure of economic needs at home, this system was 
changed by Lieut. Gen. van den Bosch (1830-1839) to a policy of 
exploitation, the central feature of which was the famed institution 
of compulsory cultivation known as the “ Culture system.”     
    
    
   
                                   
   
                        THE CULTURE SYSTEM. 
The inauguration of the Culture System (Kultuur-Stelsel) was a 
frank return to the policy of the old East India Company, the policy 
of securing the largest possible profit from the lands and industry of 
the natives. Instead, however, of requiring from each chief the 
payment of a certain subsidy or portion of the harvests, the natives 
were required to put at the disposal of the Government a part of 
their land and of their time. This was theoretically fixed at one- 
fifth, but in the actual operation of the system, even one-third or 
one-half of the native resources and labor were required. The 
system was never put into general operation; its most extensive 
practice being found on Java, West Sumatra, and northern Celebes, 
and it was not conducted under identical regulations in all places. 
Tts success was likewise uneven. Many of the crops with which the 
Government experimented, and which it required the natives to 
produce, were failures; coffee, sugar, and indigo being the only 
products from which any considerable income was ever derived. 
There was, however, a strong pressure from the home Government 
to secure all the proceeds that the system would bear, and between 
1840 and 1874 a total profit of about 781,000,000 guilders or over 
$312,000,000 was remitted to Holland. 
Rather curiously this Culture System has received almost universal 
approval from English students of colonial administration, and among 
Americans also there is a widespread understanding that the system 
was beneficial and effective in increasing the industry and well-being 
of the natives. There is, moreover, a general impression that the 
Culture System is still in full operation. All of these views are 
opposed to the facts and to the best judgment of Dutchmen them- 
selves, who visit upon the system the severest condemnation. In 
1848 the States-General by the constitutional change in the Govern- 
ment of Holland obtained control of the colonies which up to that 
time had been governed under royal prerogative. That date saw 
the passing of the organic law for the government of Netherlands- 
India called the Regeerings-Reglement, and from that day the 
Culture System was subjected to continual assault from the liberal]

members of the States-General. Advocates of a more just.and gen- 
erous policy toward the natives had their cause greatly strengthened 
about 1859 by the writing of a novel which bears the title of “Max 
Havellar, or the Coffee Auctions of the Dutch Trading Company.” 
From this time on the bitterness of the attacks on the Culture System 
increased until in 1870 the so-called Agrarian Law was passed, which 
marks the definite abandonment of the policy. Since that date a 
liberal policy of free culture with corresponding opportunities for 
Dutch planters has been followed. 
There are a few remnants or vestiges of the old Culture System 
still. On the high slopes of the active volcano of Tangkoeban Prahoe 
two years ago I saw patches of old deteriorated coffee, the crop from 
which must still be sold to the Government at a price lower than the 
market value.     
           
       
   
                    
   
   
   
   
    
        
    
   CHARACTER OF ADMINISTRATION SINCE 1870. 
Over the whole extent of Netherlands-India, a policy of paternal 
care has taken the place of the policy of exploitation. Since the 
year 1870 the Netherlands have derived no economic profit whatever 
from the Indies, and all taxation or profits to the Government from 
its mines, salt works, and other public sources of income have been 
devoted exclusively to the upbuilding of the colony. Watchful and 
jealous solicitude for the native’s protection has taken the place of 
the old indifference toward his oppression. The Government through 
its trained officials watches over native welfare at every point. The 
village elections, at which the “loera” or headman is chosen, takes 
place in the presence of a trained Dutch official, who sees that the 
actual majority preference prevails, Contracts between Dutch 
planters and the village communities for the lease of their lands are 
overseen and approved by the Dutch Resident. Everything possible 
and practicable has been done to increase the productivity of the soil. 
Probably nowhere in the world do native communities possess such 
unfailing irrigation systems, such adequate public communications 
and such healthful and well-kept villages as in Java. While the~ 
population is very dense, and the standard of living low, there is 
mevertheless every evidence of plenty, of contentment, and of health. 
In the last 80 or 40 years the Dutch have built up their adminis- 
tration until it is an example of efliciency, experience, and upright- 
The islands are prosperous, the native population is increasing, 
he opportunities for white men or actual Dutch colonialists are 
nviting. Coffee planting received a heavy blow some years ago, 
ut the profitable raising of sugar and quinine on Java and the 
rulture of tobacco on Sumatra have more than taken its place.

_ THE PERMANENCY OF DUTCH RULE. 
After three centuries of devotion to tropical service the Dutch 
show no decline in the virility and will necessary for the management 
of their vast affairs. 
Among many dangers that threaten the permanency of Dutch rule 
in Netherlands-India is the revival of the Mohammedan faith. Of 
the 40,000,000 Malay subjects of Netherlands, all but a small minority 
are followers of Islam. Curiously and interestingly, the opening of 
this century is witnessing a drawing together and a new wakening 
of the fires of unrest among the diverse peoples who profess the faith 
of the Great Arabian. One of the undoubted causes is the improved 
education which vast numbers of Mohammedans under French, 
British, or Turkish rule are obtaining. Mohammedans are contrast- 
ing their own civilization with that of Christian nations, and without 
abatement of their confidence in the truth of their own faith they 
see the higher morality and the greater political efficiency of Chris- 
tianity. In spite of the assumed inertia and rigidity of Mohammedan 
thought, something like a leaven of progress is moving in the Moham- 
medan world. Steam communications now unite all parts of Islam. 
The pilgrimage to Mecca, at one time taken with risk and expense, 
is open to thousands. More than 8,000 Malay subjects of Netherlands 
sailed on pilgrim ships for Arabia in 1908. Everywhere throughout 
Malaysia to-day one finds the Arabian missionary and proselyter. 
It is hardly necessary to say that the Dutch do not fail to study 
this great phenomenon with the attention which it deserves. Every 
candidate for the civil service studies not only the native languages 
of Malaysia, the history of native peoples and their ethnology, but 
he makes a special study of Mohammedanism as well. One of the 
remarkable offices in the Dutch administrative system is the position 
of “counselor for native affairs.” For many years this position was 
filled by a man, now a professor in the University of Leiden, who is, 
I suppose, one of the most eminent authorities on Mohammedanism in 
the world—Dr. Snoucke-Hurgronje. Yor years he sustained sympa- 
thetic acquaintance with Malayan peoples. They knew him as a 
friend as well as an official. He is one of the very few men, perhaps 
the only living man, who has imitated Sir Richard Burton in accom- 
plishing the religious journey to Mecca in the guise of a pilgrim. 
It is significant that this man, preeminent for his understanding of 
Malay character, has been a consistent upholder of the possibilities 
of the Malay, and the advocate of a generous policy. To his influence] 
are due some of the most significant changes in the Dutch system 
looking to a larger participation of the natives in the administration. 
Against all possibilities of foreign attack the Dutch oppose a far. 
sighted watchfulness and care. Every little cloud on the horizon.

albeit no larger than a man’s hand, is watched with attention and 
adequate apprehension. No difficulty is permitted to reach the state 
of actual disturbance. A high official, after discussing one of the 
minor causes of Dutch uneasiness, remarked, “You Americans do 
not have to take great care of such small things, because your size 
protects you, and a difficulty of this sort may become acute without 
alarming you, but we are few in number, we have great responsi- 
bilities, and we can not afford to let any difficulty progress to the 
point where it may affect the good will between ourselves and other 
nations.” 
The whole Dutch nation gives its closest attention to colonial 
affairs. Every intelligent Dutchman is informed upon ‘Netherlands 
India. There is a bewildering number of substantial periodicals de- 
voted to different phases of the colonies. They are unsparing critics 
of their own institutions, and it is safe to say that after their great 
triumphs in removing colonial abuses they will not easily permit 
lower standards to prevail. 
The essential factor in the permanence of Dutch rule, however, is 
still to be stated. It is the attitude of the native peoples. If Holland 
possessed in her 40,000,000 brown subjects in Malaysia a population 
sufficiently enlightened and sufficiently devoted to her rule to fight 
for its permanence, she might face the future with equanimity. But 
this assurance she does not have. 
How is the Dutch Government to meet the rapidly growing unrest 
which has filled the minds of dependent and backward peoples 
throughout the Far East—the unrest which for 40 years Spain faced 
in the Philippines and failed to satisfy; the unrest which spreads 
more widely in British India each day? The Javanese peasantry 
exhibit little evidence of it as yet, but in the large cities and ports, like 
Batavia or Sourabaya, there is an element which gives the Dutch 
Government great concern. Like the same element elsewhere, it is 
only partly native; it contains a considerable amount of Eurasian and 
Chinese blood. It is filled with dissatisfaction at the inferior position 
in society which it is forced to occupy, and, as in Manila or Calcutta 
or Cairo, its weapons are a furtive propaganda and a discontented 
press. It is only a question of time when this revolutionary spirit 
will permeate large numbers of the population. What is the Dutch 
Government doing to meet it? It is of great interest to Americans, 
in view of our own policy in the Philippines; that the Dutch seem tobe 
turning for a solution, as have we, to native education. All over the 
Indies they are building schools of the most substantial kind—schools 
for the training of native officials, schools for native teachers, a school 
in Batavia for the education of native doctors, a new school recently 
incorporated for the making of native judges, a comprehensive sys- 
13144°—xp 1911—vor 1——30 
 
-P-A-G-E-486
    466 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
tem of higher and lower elementary schools for natives in all larger 
places, and finally a plan for rural village schools, like the “ barrio” 
schools in the Philippines, accessible to the natives of every hamlet. 
The Dutch Government has already brought out over 1,000 trained 
Dutch teachers, and is adding to its force at the rate of some 250 a 
year. Though not yet as widely extended nor as highly developed 
as the American system of schools in the Philippines, the Dutch 
school system is its nearest rival among dependent. peoples. 
EDUCATION UNTIL 1894. 
Until near the middle of the last century the education of the native 
received scaft attention. But in 1848, after the Dutch States-General 
obtained control of the government of the colonies, an appropriation 
of 25,000 guilders was made for native education. This act is signifi- 
cant rather for its intent than for any considerable practical results 
which followed. In 1854 the “ regeerings reglement ” provided that 
the Governor General undertake the creation of schools for the native 
population, but these provisions were vague, and in the absence of a 
sympathetic official element and of a native demand for instruction, 
were practically inoperative for many years. At last interest awoke; 
the Department of Education, Worship, and Industries was created 
in 1868, and about 1872 the organization of schools for the native 
peoples proceeded with enthusiasm. All sorts of schools were estab- 
lished—schools for sons of chiefs, private schools, normal schools, 
professional schools—‘ Ce fut une rage,” says Chailley-Bert. Be- 
tween 1873 and 1882, 249 new schools were opened in the Indies, 
making a total of 512, with a budget of 1,250,000 guilders. 
It is interesting to observe that this general movement was con- 
temporaneous with a similar development of public instruction in the 
Philippine Islands under the Spanish Government. The public- 
school system of the Philippines was decreed in 1863, and begin- 
ning a few years later, schools were gradually established in nearly 
every pueblo of the islands. The results of these two movements, 
however, have been very dissimilar. In the Philippines the native 
population was considerably in advance of the natives of Java in 
intellectual training and ambition. There was an important well- 
to-do class who possessed property and commercial interests, and the 
mestizo element, both Spanish and Chinese, was identified (as it is 
not-in the Dutch Indies) with the natives. Thus, in the Philippines 
the Spanish system of public instruction accomplished really great 
results. In a few decades it produced a class having some educa- 
tion in the Spanish language in practically every town of the archi- 
pelago. It prepared the way for the revolutionary movement which 
has placed the Filipinos far in the lead of other Malayan peoples. 
In the Dutch Indies, however, no such native support existed. Mis- 
   
-P-A-G-E-487
  INSTRUCTION IN NETHERLANDS-INDIA. 467 
givings seem to have seized the Dutch administration, criticisms of 
so liberal a plan of native education multiplied, economy was felt 
to be necessary, and in 1884 came a reaction. The development was 
arrested, no new schools were founded, and a considerahle propor- 
tion of public schools already established were turned over to private 
er missionary societies. Of the nine normal schools which had been 
ereated five were suppressed, the teaching of Dutch to the natives 
was discontinued, and in 1896 the Netherlands-India had over a 
hundred fewer schools than it had 14 years earlier. 
Dutch critics of the educational movement of 1872-1884 say that 
the plan of studies was too occidental in character and did not sufli- 
ciently take into account the native needs and the native mind; that 
it was unpractical and too closely modeled on the educational ideals 
of Holland. All this may be true, and yet the reaction which lasted 
for nearly a decade seriously retarded the native development which 
Dutch statesmen have now come to feel is essential to the further 
development of the Indies and the permanence of their own power. 
A similar, but more intense, reaction occurred in the Philippines in 
1888, when the Spanish Government, becoming alarmed at the prog- 
ress of liberal ideas, attempted to suppress the rapidly increasing 
enlightenment of the population. In the Philippines, however, the 
popular movement had then become too strong, and when suppression 
was attempted revolution followed. 
In Netherlands-India a reorganization of the educational werk 
was finally seen to be necessary, and in 1892 and 1893 there was 
sanctioned and put into effect a scheme of native instruction which 
lad been proposed some years earlier by the director of education, 
Mr. W. P. Groeneveldt. This, with certain important additions 
of recent date, is the existing system. Under it two kinds of public 
instruction are maintained, one patterned upon the European system 
(Europeesch Onderwijs), the other native education (Onderwijs 
voor Inlanders). However, as the “ European schools” are open 
on terms of equality to children of partly European blood and to 
children of pure native parentage also, they are an important ele- 
ment in the public instruction of the natives. 
THE SCHOOLS FOR EUROPEANS. 
The Dutch have taken commendable pains for the proper instruc- 
tion of their own children in the colonies. The system is patterned 
on that of Holland itself. Dutch education is divided into lower 
(Lager Onderwijs), secondary (Middelbaar Onderwijs), and higher 
or university (Hooger Onderwijs). In Holland the lower schools 
(lagere scholen) give instruction in the Dutch language and the 
fundamental branches. This instruction occupies six years, or two
-P-A-G-E-488
  
  468 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911, 
less than the work of similar schools in the United States. Quite 
as much, however, appears to be accomplished for the child as in the 
more protracted American course. At the end of this elementary 
instruction the pupil may enter the “gymnasium” and pursue a 
classical course of studies for six years, which would correspond to 
our college course, or he may enter what is called the “higher 
burgher school,” which gives a five years’ course. This school offers 
no instruction in Latin or Greek, but thorough, practical instruction 
jn modern languages—Dutch, French, German, and English.” The 
mathematical work leads into elements of engineering. There is 
instruction in scientific branches, in history, and in political economy. 
Following graduation from the gymnasium, or the higher burgher 
school, the student enters the university or a higher technical school 
for his professional training. 
_In Netherlands-India there is no higher or university education, 
“properly speaking, but secondary education is provided. At Bata- 
via is a large and admirable school, founded in 1860, the “Gym- 
nasium Willem III.” Although founded as a gymnasium, and so 
named, the instruction corresponds to that of the hjgher burgher 
school. Its course embraces five years and includes higher arithmetic, 
geometry, mechanics, chemistry, botany, zoology, and cosmography ; 
public law and institutions, political economy, bookkeeping and ac- 
counts, history, geography, Dutch language and literature, French, 
German, English, writing, and drawing. The work in modern lan- 
guages is especially emphasized, and extends for each language over 
the entire course of five years. So considerable a number of subjects 
being pursued, the number of weekly recitations is relatively great, 
being 36 in the first two years and 42 in the last three. To an 
American the course would seem to be overheavy and possible of 
improvement by lengthening to six years. The corps of instructors, 
who number over. 40, are very competent and well-trained men, sey- 
eral being university doctors. They are well paid. 
The Gymnasium Willem ITT also conducts a special kind of instrue- 
tion (Afdeeling B) in which qualified students are prepared for the 
civil-service examination. The studies have to do with the languages, 
geography, and anthropology of Netherlands-India. The work in the 
history of Netherlands-India includes the methods and results of 
missionary propaganda and the work in anthropology lays great stress 
upon the religions of the native people and on Mohammedanism. 
There is also a second course in the history of Islam. The geography 
of Netherlands-India includes courses in the administrative system, 
resources, productions, and economic conditions. The work in native 
languages includes Malay and Javanese. Two years’ instruction is 
given in the general principles of modern law and in the penal law 
and penal procedure of Netherlands-India. These subjects of study 
   
-P-A-G-E-489
  
  INSTRUCTION IN) NETHERLANDS-INDIA. 469 
cover in a general way the program of the Higher Functionary’s Ex- 
amination (het Groot-Ambternaars-Examen) necessary for appoint- 
ment to the higher posts of the colonial service. 
Besides the Gymnasium Willem TIT, there are comparable institu- 
tions doing the work of a Dutch higher burgher school at Surabaya 
and. Samarang. ‘The Queen Wilhelmina School at Batavia is in 
effect a group of schools giving secondary instruction, much of it of a 
technical character. 
Lower European schools are found not only on Java but in all 
parts of the Indies. In 1908 there were 190 public lower schools with 
732 European teachers and 21,714 pupils, of whom 9,120 were boys 
of European birth and 7,371 girls of European birth; 3,693 were 
natives, 3,190 being male; and 1,530 were Asiatic foreigners, largely 
Chinese, 1,301 being male. There were also 40 private European 
lower schools aided by the Government, with over 5,000 pupils, mostly 
girls. The very considerable proportion of native children attending 
these schools is to be noted. In 1903 entrance was made easier for 
natives and the tuition for them was lowered. These steps were 
taken by the then director of education, Mr. Abondanon, now one of 
the foremost authorities on colonial matters in Holland. 
The rapid increase of native attendance in the European schools 
was one of the considerations which have led the Dutch within the 
last few years to reintroduce the Dutch language into native lower 
schools, and thereby divert from the European schools the unduly 
large proportion of native pupils desiring Dutch education. 
The Government is generous in its policy of organizing new public 
schools for the European population. The presence of 20 pupils in a 
locality on Java and of only 15 in the outer possessions is sufficient 
for the establishment of a school with one teacher; for 60 pupils two 
teachers are furnished; and for 90, three. A moderate tuition is 
charged, which is carefully graded in accordance with the income of 
the child’s parents and in no case exceeds 10 florins a month; in cer- 
tain cases the instruction is gratuitous. 
Religious teaching in all the public schools is forbidden. There 
are separate schools for boys and girls, but the present tendency is 
toward coeducation. The subjects of study embrace reading, writing, 
arithmetic, Dutch grammar, history of Netherlands and Netherlands- 
India, geography, nature study, singing, drawing, gymnastics, and 
sewing for girls. There are also additional subjects which are offered 
when possible and which include the elements of French, English, 
and High Dutch, general history, further work in mathematics, 
elementary land surveying, etc. The course, as in nearly all Dutch 
schools, seems very full and perhaps too ambitious, but it is made 
exceedingly practical.  
-P-A-G-E-490
  470 : EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
Compared to the number of European or mixed European people 
for whom these schools were created, the system must be regarded as 
exceedingly liberal. This population was reckoned a few years ago at 
at 80,000, and its children were in public or private primary schools to 
the number of over 20,000, or more than 25 per cent, the highest. per- 
centage of school attendance perhaps in any community in the world. 
Wherever a settlement of Dutch people grows up the Government 
sees to it that their children receive the elements of a substantial 
European education. Their solicitude in this matter is in contrast to 
the policy of other colonizing peoples. The children of English 
families in the Indies seem invariably to be sent home for their edu- 
cation, usually at a tender age. In certain important British colonies 
of the Far East there is not a single school providing an education 
for foreign children. The Dutch do not believe in the separation of 
the child from his home; they usually bring their families with them 
to the Indies, and they have developed a system which guarantees to 
these children an education certainly not inferior, and probably in 
some respects superior, to that afforded children in most parts of 
Europe. 
DUTCH SCHOOLS FOR CHINESE. 
Tn 1908 the Government made an important addition to its school 
system in establishing the “Duteh Chinese Schools” (Hollandsch 
Chinesche Scholen), to give an education in the Dutch language to 
the children of the extensive Chinese population. The Chinese in 
Netherlands-India are now estimated to number about 700,000, and 
they play a part in commercial and industrial life very similar to 
that of their countrymen in the Philippines, but there is an important 
difference. Chinese born in Netherlands-India, including the children 
of mixed Chinese and native parentage, by Dutch law remain Chinese 
and are not assimilated to the population of the country. As for 
many years Chinese have been marrying native wives, it has resulted 
that the population legally termed “ Chinese” is in considerable de- 
gree Malayan. In a private school I visited there was a classroom 
filled with boys, all of whom were termed “Chinese,” but. only two 
wore queues, and in most of them Malayan inheritance appeared to 
predominate over Chinese. These Chinese born in Netherlands-India 
do not speak any Chinese language. Their native tongue is Malay. 
They are subjects of the Dutch Government and for generations have 
been expatriated from China. At all times important to the business 
of the country, many have amassed great wealth and risen to positions 
of social influence. There is one wealthy Chinese of Samarang whose 
wealth I was informed is calculated at $20,000,000 gold. In spite of 
their thorough identification with the country and their Malayan 
blood, Chinese are subjected to certain disabilities. Except where 
   
-P-A-G-E-491
    
_INSTRUCTION IN NETHERLANDS-INDIA. 471 
special permission is given them, they are obliged to reside in Chinese 
quarters and are not free to travel or to accept employment as the 
native or European may do. Perhaps in part as a result of this illib- 
eral attitude of the Dutch Government toward them, there seems to 
be a disposition among the Chinese to turn toward the British pos- 
sessions, and particularly Singapore, which is virtually a Chinese 
city. 
The Dutch Government has come to realize that its past attitude 
toward the Chinese is not working out a satisfactory solution of their 
status. There is a recent disposition to recognize an obligation for 
their education and to seek their affection and allegiance. Chinese 
everywhere realize the practical value of education and are the best 
supporters of public schools in British Malaysia. Within the last 
four years they have entered the European schools in considerable 
numbers so far as the opportunities have permitted. In 1905 there 
were 470 boys and 55 girls of Chinese and other Asiatic origin in the 
European lower schools, but at the end of 1908 this number had 
nearly tripled. 
These considerations led to the first Holland Chinese schools, or- 
ganized in 1908, and located at Batavia, Samarang, Surabaya, and 
Macassar. In 1909 seven more were opened, at Menado (Celebes), 
Bandjermassin (Borneo), Singaraja (Bali), Padang (Sumatra), and 
at Malang, Surakarta, and Bandoeng on Java. These schools have 
the same organization and offer the same course as European lower 
schools. Educationally they promise to be successful, and their po- 
litical influence may be marked, especially if it leads to the modifica- 
tion of Dutch law liberalizing the status of Chinese subjects. 
Comparing the present status of the Chinese in Netherlands-India 
. with that of Chinese residents in the Philippines, one can hardly fail 
to be impressed with the great advantage of the policy which iden- 
tifies the descendants of an immigrant with the people of the country. 
Anyone born in the Philippines is regarded and accepted as a Filipino 
if he chooses to identify himself with the Filipino people. The sons 
of Chinese in the Philippines encounter little or no prejudice and 
often obtain high political preferment as the choice of Filipino 
electors. 
EDUCATION OF NATIVES. 
Bearing in mind that the European schools are open to children 
of native parentage we may pass to that system of instruction organ- 
ized solely for the native inhabitants (Onderwijs voor Inlanders). 
The history of this system and its reorganization in 1892-93 has been 
briefly outlined. It consists, first, of lower schools (lagere scholen) 
of two kinds, first class and second class. The second-class school 
course has four years and gives instruction in the common branches, 
but only in the native dialect and Malay. The first-class lower school  
-P-A-G-E-492
  
  472 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
now offers a six years’ course and besides instruction in the native dia- 
lect and Malay gives three years’ instruction in Dutch. The intro- 
duction of the Dutch language into these schools is very recent, but 
there were already in 1909 62 first-class lower schools with Dutch 
instructors, and 5 new ones for the island of Java will be organized 
each year in addition to similar schools in the outer possessions. The 
other subjects of study of the first-class lower school are arithmetic, 
drawing, geography of Netherlands-India, singing, elements of nat- 
ural sciences, land measuring, and local history.t 
The introduction of Dutch into these schools is seen to be a final 
return to the policy abandoned 20 years ago. The requirement of 
this language as the basis of instruction seems to have been brought 
about by several considerations. First, experience has shown that 
the native languages do not offer the necessary basis for higher train- 
ing, especially in administrative, technical, and professional lines. 
The possession of a European language is recognized as essential for 
the intellectual development of the native. In the second place, 
Netherlands-India presents the same multiplicity of languages with 
which we are familiar in the Philippines. On the island of Java the 
population is divided into three native peoples, each speaking a dis- 
tinct language—Sundanese, Javanese, and Madurese. On most of 
Sumatra Malay is the language of the people. Elsewhere the Lesser 
Sundas, the Moluccas, and Amboina have their special language, while 
Celebes has numerous languages. Through all of this territory, as 
well as in Borneo and the Sulu Archipelago, Malay, though not of 
the literary type, furnishes a lingua franca. But even this useful 
and widely spread language does not offer a satisfactory linguistic 
bond for the development of the peoples of the Indies. In the third 
place, I believe that Dutch statesmen have come to the deliberate con- 
clusion that the diffusion of the Dutch language among the peoples 
of their great Empire will be a political factor of the highest value. 
Thus Holland has deliberately forsaken its previous policy of dis- 
couraging the native education in Dutch and upon this important 
matter of the dissemination of its own language is now associated in 
policy with America in the Philippines and France in Indo-China. 
One of the other notable steps of the Dutch Government for ele- 
mentary native education is of especial significance to us, because it 
resembles the emphasis which the American school system in the 
Philippines places upon the education of the peasant or rural popula- 
tion. In 1906 the Governor General, Lieut. Gen. Van Heutsz, out- 
lined a plan for a new type of school, the “ dessa school.” The course 
is brief—three or four years—and in the local dialect. These schools 
are to be established in sufficient numbers to supply an elementary 
  
1The course differs a little in the outer possessions, i. e., Sumat: 
ete., and is detailed in a recent report of the department (‘‘ Voorseh 
Inlandsch Onderwijs,” 1908, p. 385).

education to the entire native population of Netherlands-India.. The 
thirty-odd millions of people who inhabit Java live in about 30,000 
villages, known as “ dessas” or “kampongs.” They are so grouped 
that a third of this number of schools will place primary facilities 
within the reach of the entire population. Gov. Gen. Van Heutsz 
himself assured me that 10,000 dessa schools will be established on 
the island of Java alone. These schools are at present under the 
Department of the Interior, but will be transferred to the Department 
of Education. At the end: of 1908, 367 “dessa” schools had been 
organized, and for 1909 410 additional schools were approved. The 
number will be increased with the utmost practical rapidity, not only 
in Java, but in the outer possessions as well. 
The often-expressed arguments against such a plan as this—that 
the native will be trained away from industry ; that he will be spoiled 
for toil; that he will be stimulated to unwise and dangerous ambi- 
tions—have certainly had full consideration from the Dutch and ap- 
parently they have been dismissed as theoretical and shortsighted. 
Gov. Gen. Van Heutsz in conversation expressed the conviction that 
has been felt in the Philippines—that until the rural population is 
taught to read, write, and keep accounts it will remain incapable of 
further advance. 
NORMAL SCHOOLS FOR NATIVE TEACHERS, 
Tt has already been stated that in the contraction of school work 
jn 1884 the normal schools were reduced to four. These were at 
Bandoeng and Probolinggo in Java, Fort de Kock in Sumatra, and 
at Amboina. <A fifth normal school was opened at Djokjakarta in 
1897 and a sixth at Oenarang in the residency of Samarang in 1905, 
The course of study in these schools was at first four years, but in 
1896 it was lengthened to six years, with the exception of Amboina, 
and at the same time the Dutch language was reintroduced. In these 
schools the Government furnishes free instruction to pupils and pro- 
vides them with furnished rooms and an allowance of 10 guilders a 
month for food and clothing. The buildings of the normal school 
at Bandoeng, the only one I visited, are handsome and well con- 
structed. ‘They are arranged on the pavilion plan. The central 
building has recitation rooms, office, dining and social halls. It is 
flanked by houses for the director and for the second teacher, who 
reside at the school with their families. Behind and connected by 
covered porticos are the dormitories of pupils. Beautiful grounds 
surround the school. 
A few years ago, in spite of the liberal terms of admission, it was 
somewhat difficult to maintain a full attendance at these schools; 
now they are crowded beyond their capacities, an indication of a 
change in native interest. Admission is by examination after the

boy has completed the lower-school course. The plan of studies im- 
pressed me as excellent. It embraces five years of Dutch from 5 to 
18 hours weekly, five years of Malay and of another native language 
(Javanese, Sundanese, or Bugis), arithmetic, geometry, land measur- 
ing and surveying, including leveling and waterways; geography, 
history of Netherlands-India, natural sciences, including elementary 
physics and meteorology; plant and animal life, writing in Arabic, 
in Javanese, or other native characters, and in Roman letters, music, 
and very thorough work in drawing, which is pursued for five years. 
In the fourth and fifth years instruction is given in pedagogy and 
school administration; the sixth and last year is devoted to a general 
review and to practice teaching in a well-organized training school. 
Each normal school has five European instructors and two, three, or 
four native instructors, according to the number of native languages 
taught. 
TRAINING SCHOOLS FOR NATIVE FUNCTIONARIES. 
As is generally understood, the native royalty and aristocracy play 
an important part in the administration of the Indies. In the devel- 
opment of Dutch rule, the native sultans, princes, and chiefs of dif- 
ferent degrees were gradually brought under control and into de- 
pendence on the Dutch Government and were required to aid the 
administration in its exploitation of the islands. For a long time the 
Dutch concerned themselves very little about the way these native 
chiefs ruled their subjects, provided they remained loyal and fur- 
nished the required contribution. Gradually, in recent decades, they 
have been moved to protect the native population against the rapacity 
and cruelty of their own rulers. A European administration was in- 
troduced, charged with the responsibility of insuring justice and 
well-being to the natives, and in this way the present Government 
received its character. For more than a generation the Dutch have 
been giving to the native population an undoubtedly equitable and 
most carefully conducted government. In the exercise of their sur- 
veillance over native chieftains they have worked out a truly re- 
markable system. It appears to be based upon two judgments of 
native character—first, that the natives to be content and obedient 
must be governed, or believe themselves to be governed, by rulers of 
their own race; second, these rulers, owing to a special peculiarity of 
Malay character, are content with the semblance of power, though 
deprived of its actuality. Dutch experience seems to justify the 
truth of these generalizations. Give the native the office, the title, 
the formal recognition, and he cares little if a higher but unobtrusive 
authority directs and controls him. 
In fulfillment of these principles Java and most other parts of 
the Dutch Indies are divided into “regencies,’ which correspond 
 
-P-A-G-E-495
  
INSTRUCTION IN NETHERLANDS-INDIA. 475 
somewhat to former native states. At the head of each is a native 
“regent ”—a prince or an aristocrat, appointed and removable by 
the Governor General. The regent has come to be simply a salaried 
officer of the Government. His orders are issued and his business 
conducted by a native minister, or “adipati.” At the regent’s side 
is the Dutch “resident,” an officer of life-long experience in the 
Indies, popularly known as the “elder brother” of the regent. It is 
the resident who actually controls the administration in every detail. 
The regency itself is divided into districts, administered for the re- 
gents by a corps of native officers known as the “ wedono,” but these 
“wedono” are in all respects amenable to a highly trained corps of 
Dutch district officers known as “controleurs.” These are the men 
whose business it is to see that the local government goes on efficiently 
and fairly; that agriculture is properly attended to; that local irri- 
gation systems and roads are maintained; and that the relations be- 
tween the native communities and Dutch planters are harmonious and 
helpful. The unit of administration is the little hamlet already 
referred to, known sometimes by the Malay word “ kampong,” but 
more often in Java by the name of “dessa.” It is in large measure 
self-governed. The people in an open-air, meeting, supervised by 
the “ controleur,” elect their headman, usually called the “ loera.” 
These local headmen, as well as the various “mandoers” or over- 
seers, are wholly or in large part uneducated natives, but “ wedonos,” 
“mantris,” or subordinate officials, clerks, and accountants are, wher- 
ever possible, educated. The number of such native employees is 
large. As early as 1878 there were opened at Bandoeng, Magelang, 
and Probolinggo on Java, and at Tondano in northern Celebes, four 
schools for the sons of native chiefs and other well-to-do natives. 
These schools were called “ Scholen voor de zonen van Inlandsche 
hoofden en andere aanzienlijke Inlanders,” or “ Hoofdenscholen.” 
The course in these schools was originally four years. In 1893 they 
were reorganized, the course extended to five years, and instruction 
in Dutch was abandoned. Since that date the schools have been 
reorganized again; Dutch has been reintroduced as the principal 
subject and as the medium of instruction, and the name of all of them 
except the one at Tondano changed to “ Training Schools for Native 
Functionaries”” (Opleidingsscholen voor Inlandsche Ambternaren). 
Three additional such schools—at Serang (Bantam), at Madioen, 
and at Bliter, in Kediri—opened in October, 1910, each with accom- 
modations for 140 pupils. In 1911, at Macassar, a training school 
with a normal department will be opened to train teachers and civil 
servants for Celebes and Borneo. Similar instruction is given at the 
normal school at Fort de Kock, Sumatra. The course of study is 
divided into three sections: A preparatory of two years, a first of 
three years, and a second of two years. The preparatory section has

476 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
been recently. introduced in order to give the entering student a 
better preparation in the Dutch language than he receives in the first- 
class lower school from which he comes. 
The subjects of study embrace the Dutch and Malay languages 
and the native language of the district in which the school is situ- 
ated, geography, arithmetic, nature study, writing, grammar, history 
of Netherlands-India, and algebra. In the advanced section of the 
school the pupil studies jurisprudence, public and administrative law 
of the Indies, political economy, land surveying, waterways, line 
and map drawing. The instruction in jurisprudence is given in every 
instance by a doctor of laws of a European university. 
I visited the “ Opleidingsschool”” at Bandoeng and was impressed 
by the excellence of buildings and equipment, the character and the 
enthusiasm of teachers, and the fine appearance and behavior of stu- 
dents. These young men are selected youths, coming of the best 
native families not only of Java but of the outer possessions. Among 
the students was the son of the deposed Sultan of Atjeh, who is kept 
in confinement on the island of Amboina. My impression was that 
these schools should produce a corps of native officials extremely well 
prepared for the duties of local administration, to which many of 
them will be assigned. 
Under the present system they would hold only subordinate posi- 
tions, in which their work would be subjected to the inspection of 
European officials, but some change in this matter is apparently con- 
templated. The present tendency seems to be to train the native for 
actual power, in place of that semblance of authority which the Dutch 
have ever carefully preserved. Much of this changed attitude is 
attributed, I believe, to the former counsellor for native affairs, Dr. 
Snoucke-Hurgronje. He was long an advocate not only of the intel- 
lectual powers of native Javanese or other Malayans, but of their 
reliability and trustworthiness. Due to his efforts, a plan was formu- 
lated by the former Gov. Gen. Rooseboom and accomplished under 
his suecessor, Gov. Gen. Van Heutsz, to train natives to be judges. 
A committee, consisting of Dr. Snoucke-Hurgronje, the procurator 
general, and Dr. Koster, the present director of education, framed the 
organization of a new training school for native magistrates, which 
was opened in July of 1909 at Batavia and is known as the “ Oplei- 
dingsschool yoor Inlandsche Rechtskundigen.” Seventy-two pupils 
are admitted to this law school; the instructors are all Dutch doctors 
of law. The course promises to be thorough in all branches of law 
and administration. At the end of the course the graduate will take 
a public examination and will then be appointed to the position of 
“ oviffier,” a sort of recorder or clerk to the president of a “landraad,” 
or district court. The president of a landraad is at present always 
a Dutch doctor of laws. He alone determines the decision, but is

    advised by a number of native assistants or assessors. The candidate, 
after a thorough training as a recorder of this court, will be ad- 
vanced to the position of member of the landraad, vice president, 
and eventually to that of president—a position now held exclusively 
by Europeans. 
THE “ DOKTER DJAWA.” 
Another professional training school of note is the medical school 
at Batavia, commonly known as the “ Dokter Djawa.” This insti- 
tution was founded in-1869 and its success up to 1900 is spoken of 
slightingly by M. Chailley-Bert. In 1902, however, it was reorgan- 
ized, and-its course extended to three years preparatory and six 
medical. It now has 150 students, to whom it appears to give a 
thoroughly modern course in medicine. These students have three 
years of dissecting, attend school clinics in which 4,000 patients are 
treated yearly, and in addition to thorough instruction in Dutch are 
given three years of German language. The chemical and pharma- 
cological laboratories seem to be adequate. There are students in 
attendance not only of Java, but from Amboina, Bornéo, and Su- 
matra, There are living accommodations and a very attractive club- 
room in the institution.. The graduating class in 1909 numbered 17; 
and I was assured by the director that the graduates encounter no 
difficulty in the practice of their profession and that many of them 
obtain positions as medical officers on plantations at monthly salaries 
ranging from 200 to 500 guilders. 
In addition to the above schools there are various special schools 
in a number of places, of which little needs to be said here. Mention 
should be made, however, of the effort of the Dutch Government to 
establish industrial education. This important subject has not had 
as much success in the Dutch schools as it has in the Philippines, 
where industrial arts are pursued from the beinning of the primary 
course and where there are already a large number of well-equipped 
industrial schools. It seems more difficult in Java to familiarize the 
native with the purpose of these schools and to prevail upon the 
graduate to seek an independent practice of his trade. Students are 
inclined to look to the Government for employment and to expect an 
official position upon graduation. There is, however, a need of skilled 
native labor, especially in the machine shops of Surabaya and the 
railway shops at Bandoeng, where skilled workers obtain from 30 to 
00 guilders a month. There have been decreed three trade schools 
(“Ambachtsscholen”) for Surabaya, Samarang, and Batavia. That 
n Samarang was opened in October, 1910. It offers instruction in 
carpentry, masonry, blacksmithing, boiler making, wagon making, 
achine-shop practice, furniture making, tinsmithing, etc. The cost 
f establishing these schools is estimated at 100,000 guilders and the 
nnual expense of conducting them at 37,000 guilders each.

  478 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
AID TO PRIVATE SCHOOLS. 
Grants-in-aid were limited originally to European higher schools 
and for a long time the Government preserved a strict neutrality on 
religious matters, giving its aid only to those schools which were sup- 
ported by secular societies and taught no religion. In 1900, however, 
freedom of religious instruction in subsidized schools was allowed, 
since which date many new schools have been established by both 
Protestants and Roman Catholics. In 1905 grants-in-aid were ex- 
tended to lower schools for natives, and in 1908 the States General 
of Holland enacted legislation of a still more liberal character, grant- 
ing subsidies generally to schools established and maintained by 
missionary organizations. This step has not commanded entire ap- 
proval either in Java or among legislators in Holland, but is due to 
the triumph in the Dutch States General of the Clerical Party, a 
combination of Protestant and Roman Catholic members, over the 
Liberal Party, whose educational program is secular. 
The Dutch Government exercises inspection over these schools and 
they constitute a very important element in the education of the . 
Indies. 
The number of pupils instructed in private lower schools for 
natives is very large, more than twice that of public schools of the 
same class. Most of these private schools are supported by Protes- 
tant missionary societies and are in the outer possessions. The figures 
for lower schools in Java are 468 that are subsidized and 93 that are 
not subsidized; in the outer possessions, 257 subsidized and 891 not 
subsidized. These private schools have an attendance of over 30,000 
in Java and nearly 50,000 pupils in the outer possessions, or about 
80,000 out of a total of 190,000 pupils in both public and private lower 
native schools in Netherlands-India. The total number of teachers 
in lower native schools, both public and private, was 5,612 in 1907; 
of these, 1,382 were in public schools of Java and 1,465 in public 
schools in the outer possessions.     
                  
    
    
                  
        
   
       
    
   TERMS OF SERVICE FOR DUTCH TEACHERS, 
The force of Dutch teachers for Netherlands-India is secured from 
Holland. There are opportunities for normal training for young 
Dutchmen in Java, but the attractions of commercial employment are 
too alluring, and the Government practically secures no teachers 
among them. As stated elsewhere, there are over a thousand Dutch 
teachers and the number is annually increasing. Ultimately the force 
will probably be at least 2,000. Most of these teachers are men, but 
there are women teachers for instruction in the schools exclusively 
for girls or admitting girls. The terms of service are liberal and| 
attractive compared with the Philippines, yet I was assured by offi

cials of the Department of Education that considerable diffieulty is 
experienced in securing as large a number as is desired. 
In the Philippine school service it has been the practice to appoint 
a large proportion of teachers from among university graduates with 
or without special pedagogical training and experience, but the Dutch 
force seems to be recruited entirely from those who have taken teach- 
ers’ training courses in Holland. 
The normal schools of Holland admit students who have completed 
the lower schools. The normal course is four years. Pupils receive 
from the Government an annuity of 300 guilders for their support. 
At the end of a four years’ course they pass a State teacher’s examina- 
tion. Their education does not stop, however, with this examination. 
Two years later the “ head master’s” examination may be taken and 
also State secondary examinations to qualify for teaching a special 
subject, such as modern languages, higher mathematics, drawing, or 
engineering. 
Teachers appointed for Netherlands-India are divided into three 
classes—first, second, and‘ third—the first being highest. They are 
promoted for capacity and length of service. A male teacher holding 
a head master’s certificate receives on original appointment 150 
guilders ($60 gold) a month, with an allowance of 50 guilders ($20) 
for house rent. Even though he may not receive promotion to a 
second or first class position, he will receive an automatic increase of 
50 guilders monthly at the end of each three years until he has been 
so increased six times. Normal-school teachers receive these increases 
every two years. Second-class teachers are appointed at 200 guilders, 
with 60 guilders a month for house rent, and increases of 50 guilders 
a month every three years. First-class teachers receive 250 guilders 
a month and 70 guilders allowance for lodgings, with similar incre- 
ments of 50 guilders a month after each three years of service until 
they have received this advance six times. Thus at the end of 18 
years the first-class Dutch teacher receives $220 (550 guilders) 
monthly and an allowance of $28 (70 guilders) for quarters. Women 
who are appointed to the position of third-class teacher receive 125 
guilders, with 50 guilders for lodgings, but on promotion to the 
second or first class they receive the same compensation as men. 
Upon appointment each teacher is given a gratuity of 700 guilders for 
is outfit, and if he has a special certificate for teaching a modern 
anguage or other subject an additional gratuity of 100 guilders if 
¢ is a bachelor or 200 if he is a married man. This latter gratuity 
he teacher is expected to devote to his own insurance, the Govern- 
ment maintaining an insurance system for its employees. On disa- 
ility or death the teacher of his family will receive an annuity of not 
nore than 170 guilders a month, with additional sums for children. 
he children on the death of their mother will receive two-thirds of

the amount that she drew as the widow of a deceased employee. 
After 10 years of service teachers receive 1 year of furlough, with 
about one-half pay during the year. The Government bears all their 
traveling expenses from India to Holland and return, both on ap- 
pointment and on furlough. If teachers are married and have chil- 
dren, the Government likewise bears the expenses of every member 
of the family. It will be seen from this that the contemplated period 
of service is 20 years, broken by 1 year of leave, although the proba- 
bility is that this will shortly be increased to 1 year of leave in 7 
making two periods of leave for the entire 20 years. After 
these 20 years of service the teacher may retire on one-fourth pay, 
with certain additions. 
The above salaries do not include those which are paid to directors 
of normal and training schools nor the salaries of teachers in the 
higher schools, all of which are very much better. Teachers in the 
secondary schools receive an entrance salary of 450 guilders a month, 
which gradually increases to 750 guilders at the end of 12 years. 
Salaries of such teachers are raised also for certificates of profi- 
ciency in certain subjects, which include ethnology, native languages, 
surveying, higher mathematics, drawing, ete. For each certificate 
obtained by examination the teacher’s salary is increased 50 guilders 
monthly. 
Taking all of these facts into consideration, the teacher’s compen- 
sation may be very good indeed. For example, I met a director of a 
normal school who receives a salary of 500 guilders ($200) a month, 
plus four increases due to two years’ service each in the normal school, 
making an addition of 200 guilders, and 50 guilders each for certifi- 
cates of competency to teach Sudanese and engineering, or a total 
monthly salary of 800 guilders ($320) ; besides this, he is furnished 
with a comfortable house of seven large rooms. 
  PUBLIC EXPENDITURES FOR SCHOOLS. 
Under the strictly centralized system of administration which pre-" 
vails in the Dutch Indies all taxes are turned into the general treas- 
ury and redistributed for local administration according to estimated 
needs. The expenditures in 1897 for public schools and private schools 
amounted to 1,255,630 guilders ($502,252), and in 1907 to 2,678,353 
guilders, an increase of more than 100 per cent. The estimate for ex- 
penses of education during the year 1910 indicates a still greater devel- 
opment of school work and expenditure. The total estimated cost was 
3,570,200 guilders ($1,428,080) , divided between the following branches 
of instruction: For the support of public lower and special schools, 
for general education on Java and Madura and popular instructio: 
in Atjeh, 2,438,000 guilders; for training schools for native official

and sons of chiefs and for the training school for magistrates, 
216,300 guilders; for normal schools, 219,500 guilders; for trade 
schools, 83,000 guilders; for administration, 143,600 guilders; for 
subsidies or grants in aid, 418,600 guilders; for miscellaneous expendi- 
tures, 51,200 guilders. Income from tuitions is estimated at 296,200 
guilders, leaving a balance to be appropriated by the State of 
8,274,000 guilders. The above figures do not include the cost of con- 
struction of new buildings, which, except for “dessa” schools, is 
borne by the State, and will amount in the next few years to very 
large sums annually.

  CHAPTER XV. 
RECENT EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS IN MEXICO. 
By L. S. Rowe, 
Research Assistant, Carnegie Institution, Washington, D. C. 
The educational history of Mexico forms one of the most remark- 
able chapters in the history of Latin civilization on the American 
Continent. In Mexico the Spanish conquerors adopted a more 
enlightened policy than in any other portion of the Spanish domin- 
ion. It is true of Mexico, as of the Argentine Republic, Chile, 
and Peru, that special attention was directed to higher education. 
Although primary instruction was almost totally neglected in the 
far southern countries, the Spanish authorities in Mexico showed 
some appreciation of the necessity of improving the condition of the 
native Indians. As early as 1532 the Spanish conquerors had made 
provision for primary instruction in Mexico City for 1,000 pupils. 
In 1553 the University of Mexico was opened, offering courses in 
theology, civil law, canon law, medicine, and the native languages. 
As in all the higher institutions of learning in the countries of Latin 
America, the University of Mexico was under the direct control of 
the Catholic Church, and remained so until the relation was abolished 
in the struggle between church and state in the sixties. With the 
confiscation of all ecclesiastical property, the university organization, 
which had gradually declined until it was hardly more than a mere 
shadow, disappeared. 
The systematic development of public education entered upon a 
new era with the inauguration of President Juarez. Under the con- 
stitution of 1857 the Federal Government controls the system of 
primary education in the Federal District and in the organized ter- 
ritories, but it has no power over primary education within the 
States. At the time of the formation of the constitution, there was 
a movement to place the entire system of public instruction under 
the authority of the Federal Government. Sectional feeling at the 
time was so strong that it was not possible to secure the acceptance 
of this plan. 
There is but little doubt that had the Federal Government been 
able to secure complete control of publié education, the system would 
have made far greater advances during the last half century. This 
is due primarily to the fact that the revenues and credit of the 
483  
-P-A-G-E-504

central Government are far in advance of those of the individual 
States. Furthermore, the fact that the States have failed to develop 
a distinctive and vigorous political life and that their administrative 
system is not thoroughly organized makes it difficult for them to 
secure the expert direction necessary for the growth of a vigorous 
system of public education. 
The magnitude of the problem confronting the country can best 
be seen from an examination of the data relating to illiteracy. Sig- 
nificant as they are, it is likely that they underestimate rather than 
exaggerate the degree of illiteracy that prevails.

    PRIMARY INSTRUCTION. 
  Although the Federal Government exercises no direct control over 
public education within the States of the Union, there exists through- 
out the Republic practical uniformity in organization. 
Primary instruction includes five years of elementary grades and 
two years of advanced grades. The course of study in these schools 
has been carefully worked out, but the greatest obstacle in the way 
of efficient service is the failure to pay anything approaching adequate 
‘compensation to teachers. Even in the Federal District, where sal- 
aries are much higher than in the States, the principals of primary 
schools receive but $730 per annum. The compensation of teachers 
ranges from $328.50 to $547.50 per annum, depending upon the de- 
 
-P-A-G-E-506
  486 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
gree of preparation and term of service. It is evident that with such 
low salaries teaching as a profession does not offer much to allure 
young men and women, and it is not surprising that the Government 
should find great difficulty in securing competent candidates for the 
available positions. 
TRAINING FOR TEACHERS. 
During the past few years a strong effort has been made in all the 
States, but especially in the Federal District, to improve the training 
schools for teachers. The improvement has been due in large part to 
the influence of the National Department of Public Education, and 
to the example set by the two excellent normal schools of the Federal 
District. The new building which has been erected for the Men’s 
Normal School is thoroughly equipped and modern in every respect. 
In order to induce young men to enter the teaching profession the 
Government has provided liberally for scholarships and stipends. 
The Normal School for Women in the Federal District occupies an 
old building which is not adapted to its purposes. In spite of the 
inadequate accommodations, however, the school is doing excellent 
work, and compares favorably with most of the normal schools in the 
United States. 
The course of study in the normal schools covers a period of five 
years and includes the following subjects: 
  First year,

RECENT EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS IN MEXICO. 487 
MANUAL, TECHNICAL, AND VOCATIONAL TRAINING. 
During the last 10 years the movement for the introduction of 
manual training into primary schools, both in the Federal District 
and in the States, has acquired considerable force. The late Minister 
of Public Instruction, Dr. Justo Sierra, as well as the Assistant 
Secretary, Dr. Ezequiel A. Chavez, saw clearly that the fundamental 
need of the great mass of the Indian population was the kind of 
training that would turn the attention of the younger men to the 
mechanic arts. Mexico lacks a native artisan class. The over- 
crowding of the legal and medical professions has become a serious 
problem in all the Latin-American countries, and is traceable to the 
continuance of the old Spanish prejudice against trade and commerce. 
This tendency has been strengthened by the purely dialectic charac- 
ter of the curriculum of the secondary schools, which are molded 
after the French system. The introduction of manual training, 
therefore, into the primary schools of the Federal District possessed 
a significance in Mexico far greater than in many other countries. 
The influence of the change in the primary schools of the Federal 
District has been felt in all the States. Although but a beginning 
has been made in this direction, the important fact is that emphasis 
is now being laid on this type of training. 
In the matter of vocational training, a beginning has been made in 
the Federal District, and also in some of the States, notably Chihua- 
hua, but it is true that this movement is still in its infancy. In the 
Federal District there is an excellent trade school for boys and 
another for girls. 
The school for boys prepares for the following trades: Carpenter- 
ing, woodworking, ironwork, decorative painting and sculpture, elec- 
trical and industrial mechanics. For each of these, special courses 
are prescribed. 
The School of Industrial Arts for Girls includes the -following 
courses: Typewriting, bookkeeping, stenography, sewing, dressmak- 
ing, hat making, artificial-flower making, embroidery, lace making, 
wig making, hair-dressing, and domestic science. In addition there 
are a number of courses taken by all pupils in natural history, physics, 
and chemistry. In this school over a thousand pupils are registered. 
It is the purpose of the Federal authorities to increase the number of 
these schools as rapidly as the resources of the Government will 
permit. 
COMMERCIAL EDUCATION. 
The introduction of commercial education, especially in its higher 
grades, is another of the recent changes in the system of public edu- 
cation. The first step in this direction was taken through the intro- 
duction of commercial courses in the higher grades of the primary 
 
-P-A-G-E-508
  
488 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
schools of the Federal District.. The next step was the establishment 
of a commercial section in the National Secondary School, and the 
final step in this movement was the establishment of a higher school 
of commercial education in the national capital. In the States but 
little has been done in this respect. Through the influence of the 
former governor of Chihuahua, the Hon. Enrique Creel, a commercial 
school was established in the capital of that State. If the plans 
formulated by Gov. Creel are carried out, this school will serve as a 
model for the other States for institutions of a similar character. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION, 
The instruction corresponding more or less closely to the high 
schools of our American system is given in the so-called “ escuelas 
preparatorias” or preparatory schools. The organization, as well as 
the curriculum of these schools, is patterned after the French 
“Lycée” (modern course), and is designed to prepare students for 
the professional schools of the university. The system of secondary 
instruction is well organized in the Federal District, but constitutes 
the weakest link in the chain of education in most of the States. 
The most serious criticism to be made is the undue emphasis laid on 
examinations and the failure to keep in close touch with the work 
of the pupil during the course of the scholastic year. In every sub- 
ject a series of printed questions is furnished the pupil, and in most 
cases his preparation consists in an attempt to memorize the answers 
to a disconnected series of questions, rather than to secure a broad 
grasp of any of the subjects. The result is that pupils pass through 
the “escuela preparatoria ” with but a smattering of a great number 
of subjects, many of which are entirely beyond his mental grasp. 
A serious attempt is now making to reducé the number of subjects 
taught and to require a more thorough training in a few fundamental 
courses. If this change is made it will constitute a marked improve- 
ment over the present system. The course of study covers a period 
of five years and includes the following subjects: 
  First year. Third year.

HIGHER EDUCATION. 
The movement for the establishment of a university in Mexico 
was initiated by Charles V in 1551, but no courses were offered until 
1553. From that time until the final abolition of this institution by 
the Juarez Government in 1867, the only university organization 
existing in Mexico was under the direct control of the Catholic 
Church. As the demand for higher education, and especially for 
professional training, became more insistent the Government estab- 
lished a series of independent professional institutions. The medical 
school, the law school, and the engineering school grew up inde- 
pendently, each with its own director responsible to the Minister of 
Public Instruction. 
This form of organization proved unsatisfactory for many reasons, 
but especially because it prevented the development of any unity of 
purpose in higher education and was a permanent obstacle to the 
growth of that university spirit which exerts so marked an influence 
on the life and thought of the student body. 
The necessity for closer coordination of university instruction 
became so pressing that the Government finally decided to correlate 
the work of the several independent faculties in a university organi- 
zation. The centennial anniversary of Mexican independence was 
made the occasion for the inauguration of this plan. Under the law 
of May 26, 1910, the existing schools of law, medicine, engineering, 
and architecture were made integral parts of the new National 
University of Mexico. To this a graduate school was added, in- 
tended for the conduct of special research in every field of science. 
The national preparatory school in the city of Mexico was also made 
lan integral part of the new university organization. 3 
The university is placed under the control of a president, desig- 
ated as the “ Rector,” and a university council. This council is 
omposed of the president of the university, the deans of the pro- 
essional schools, and the director general of primary instruction. 
n addition, four members are designated by the Minister of Public 
nstruction and two representatives from each of the professional 
chools are elected by the respective faculties. The student body is 
Jso given representation on the university council by a provision 
hich gives to the students in each of the professional schools the 
ight to elect one of their number as their representative on the 
louncil. The council is given wide powers over university organiza-

    tion and administration, but the final authority in all important 
questions is vested in the Minister of Public Instruction. 
The official inauguration of the university took place on the 22d of 
September, 1910. It is, of course, too early to express any opinion 
on the operation of the new system. The results thus far attained, 
however, are sufficient to indicate the importance of the step that has 
been taken. A spirit of solidarity among the students, as well as in 
the teaching staff is rapidly developing. The cooperation that has 
been established between the various faculties is improving not only 
the content of the courses but also the spirit of university instruction. 
PRESENT NEEDS OF THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. 
The experience of the last 25 years points clearly to the necessity 
of increasing the authority of the Federal Government in all matters 
relating to public education. It was generally supposed that the 
late Minister of Public Instruction, the Hon. Justo Sierra, would 
inaugurate a movement for the nationalization of primary and sec- 
ondary education. His long experience, first as Assistant Secretary 
and then as Secretary of Public Instruction, had convinced him that 
the resources of the individual States were inadequate to meet the 
requirements of public education, especially in view of the alarming 
percentage of illiteracy that prevailed throughout the Republic. It 
is true that through a reorganization of the system of State taxation 
it would be possible greatly to inerease the income available for 
educational purposes, but the political influence of the large-landed 
proprietors is so great that it is not likely that any considerable 
increase in the taxation of real estate will be made. Furthermore, 
owing in large part to the prevailing illiteracy, there is no well- 
organized public opinion within the States demanding an increase 
in educational facilities. Mexico needs a great national system o 
public education, organized, supervised, and directly controlled b. 
the Federal Government. 
In order to adapt any system of public education, whether Stat 
or National, to the needs of the country, it will be necessary to plac 
greater emphasis on vocational and technical training. There has 
been a tendency to regard the Indian as incapable of industrial o 
mechanical efficiency. It is a notable fact, however, that wherever 
serious attempt has been made at industrial training it has prove 
successful, at least to the extent of making of the Indian a fairl, 
efficient artisan, and thus increasing his earning capacity. It is mos 
important that the earning capacity of the mass of the Mexicay 
population be raised as preliminary to the raising of the standard o 
life, and this can only be done through increasing their industri 
efficiency.

The first effect of the political and sccial upheaval consequent upon 
the recent revolutionary movement has been a disorganization of the 
system of public instruction throughout the country, both in its lower 
and higher grades. The complete change of administrative per- 
sonnel has involved the dismissal of many teachers and has led to 
the growth of a feeling of uncertainty on the part of those now 
holding positions in the public schools. It is true that both Presi- 
dent Madero and the members of his cabinet have expressed_ their 
determination to concentrate effort on public instruction, but as yet 
no definite plans have been formulated to effect this purpose.

    CHAPTER XVI. 
EDUCATION IN PERU. 
By J. A. MacKnieur, 
President of the Men’s Normal School, Lima.            
    
    
      
    
    
    
    
               
    
       
     
   
     
   
   
    
   GEOGRAPHICAL AND SOCIOLOGICAL CONDITIONS. 
In order to understand the educational situation in Peru it is 
necessary to take into account certain physical and sociological con- 
ditions, such as the sharp contrasts in physical features, resulting 
in an extremely variable climate, and a strange mingling of races 
giving rise to certain pronounced ethnical and social characteristics, 
Peru extends from within 2° of the equator to nearly 20° south 
latitude, or a distance equal to that from New York to St. Louis. 
This fact in itself would tend to produce great variation of climate, a 
condition which is complicated by the further fact that the country 
is divided by the narrow and high Andean cordillera into three well- 
marked parallel regions: The coast, the sierra, and the montafia. 
The first is from 10 to 50 miles wide and has a warm climate through- 
out the entire length of the State; from June to September, the 
winter season, one rarely sees the sun, and the continual ‘‘Scotch 
mist”’ amounts at times almost to a light shower; in the remaining 
months it is rather hot and without rain. The sierra embraces a 
region from 50 to 200 miles wide, is very high, and has a bracing but 
mot intensely cold climate, which varies but slightly throughout the 
year. The montafia is the eastern slope of the mountains, rich in 
vegetable and mineral products, but inhabited mostly by half-civilized 
ndians, and in very few places have attempts been made to establish 
chools. 
The climatic conditions are not more variable than the races of the 
ountry. The monthly school report calls for racial data under the 
ollowing heads: Whites, Indians, mestizos, and negroes. The 
whites, chiefly of Spanish descent with a sprinkling of foreigners, are 
ound principally in the coast region, the Indians and mestizos in the 
jerra and the montafia, and the negroes in the north, but one meets 
vith a goodly number of all three races in every part of the country. 
t is worth noting that, except in the case of very well-marked types, 
lhe classification according to race is a rather arbitrary matter, so

        494 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
that two equally well-informed teachers might easily classify many 
of the same pupils of a school differently. 
Whether due to the climatic conditions or the intermingling of 
races, or both, one is soon impressed with certain national character- 
istics which are so deeply ingrained that it is necessary to keep them 
well in mind in order to understand the attitude of the people 
toward public education. It must not be supposed that these traits 
are to be found only among Peruvians. 
European education was introduced into Peru as in other Spanish 
colonies by ecclesiastics and the teaching orders of the Roman Cath- 
olic Church who followed in the wake of the Spanish conquerors. 
Until the eighteenth century the Jesuits practically controlled the 
work and were active in maintaining missions among the native 
population. 
The University of San Marcos, ‘‘the oldest on the Western Conti- 
nent,’’ was established in Lima by papal bull in 1571 and confirmed 
by royal decree the following year; that of Cuzco in like manner in 
1692. Besides these higher institutions, which still exist, the religious 
orders maintained nine colleges for the education of their novitiates. 
THE MODERN PERIOD. 
With the declaration of independence in 1821 came the provision 
of a free public school in the capital of each Department, the religious 
orders being obliged at the same time to maintain one such school for 
the education of the poor of each parish. In 1822 a normal school 
was established in Lima on the Lancasterian plan, and three years 
later one was ordered established on the same basis in the capital of 
each Department. In 1823 it was declared that the Republic owed 
free education to everybody, and a Central Bureau of Education was 
established with the purpose of administering the schools to that end. 
In Lima in 1833 four schools were established for each sex, o 
Lancasterian lines. The course of study embraced reading, writing, 
arithmetic, grammar, and religion, with instruction in sewing for th 
girls. 
Some idea of the character of secondary education of that time ma; 
be gathered from the curriculum of the college of San Carlos, one o 
the principal secondary schools of Lima, which was as follows

EDUCATION IN PERU. 495 
The normal schools having fallen into decline, two. were reestab 
lished in Lima in 1836. The Universities of Trujillo and Arequipa 
were founded in 1824 and 1835, respectively. 
The period from 1821 to 1907 was marked by successive changes 
in the system of administration with little steady progress in the 
actual work of education. The most decisive forward movement 
began in 1904 under the administration of Don Jose Pardo. The 
complete reorganization of the school system was provided by the 
law of December 5, 1905, and in March, 1910, the administration of 
the three grades of instruction, primary, secondary, and higher, was 
consolidated and placed in charge of the Central Directorate of 
Public Education. The National Council of Education was revived 
in 1907 and was constituted as follows: 
The minister as presiding officer, the director general of public 
education,.the rector of the University of San Carlos, of Lima, a 
delegate elected by each of the faculties of this university, the director 
of the National College of Guadaloupe, of Lima, the director of the 
Men’s Normal School, the three directors of the Schools of Engineer- 
ing, Agriculture, and Arts and Trades, respectively, and a delegate 
named by the private schools. This council, which works through 
its respective committees, has the right of initiative in all school 
matters 
       
   
                                 
    
              
   
   
    
   
    
   
    THE PRESENT ORGANIZATION OF THE SCHOOLS. 
The present highly centralized system of school administration in 
Peru follows very closely the political organization, and depends 
very largely for its successful operation upon the efficiency and 
impartiality of the political authorities. The Republic of Peru is 
divided into 19 Departments and 2 constitutional Provinces. These 
Departments are the centers of political administration, the highest 
authority in each being the prefect, who is appointed by the execu- 
tive; the Departments are divided into from 2 to 10 Provinces, over 
each of which is a subprefect, and the Provinces are in turn divided 
into districts, usually corresponding to the towns and villages, over 
each of which is a gobernador (governor). Besides this hierarchy of 
national authorities there is a municipal organization in each city. 
For school purposes there is a similar hierarchy of administrative 
officials: The highest school authority in the Department is the de- 
partmental inspector, who is at the same time inspector of the Proy- 
ince in which the capital of the Department is situated; under him 
are the provincial inspectors of the remaining Provinces; below 
these are the district inspectors, who look after the several schools of 
their respective districts. In general, these inspectors are responsi- 
le to the Central Directorate of Public Instruction, as are also the 
irectors of the secondary schools and universities.

   The Central Directorate of Public Instruction, at the head of which 
stands the Director General, is charged with the administration of the 
educational institutions of the country, subject to the ‘‘reglamento” 
(regulations) and the directions of the minister and the national 
council. Its work is divided into five sections, as follows: Primary 
education, secondary and higher instruction, statistics, supplies, and 
properties and incomes. This directorate exercises only administra- 
tive functions, operating through the inspectors of primary schools 
and the directors of the middle and higher schools. Each grade of 
instruction has its own ‘‘reglamento” and course of study. 
PRIMARY EDUCATION. 
Organization.—According to article 24 of the Constitution, the 
State guarantees the maintenance and diffusion of free primary 
education, and by the same article makes it compulsory. In prac- 
tice, only the first two years are compulsory, although primary edu- 
cation comprises five years of study; this is divided into two grades 
of two and three years, respectively, so that the first grade only is 
compulsory. Instruction of the second grade, which is optional, is 
offered only in central schools (centros escolares), which exist in the 
capitals of all Provinces and in some of the other more important 
towns. The reglamento provides for at least a mixed school in all 
plantations, mining settlements, and villages of less than 200 inhab- 
itants; those of more than 200 are entitled to a central school. Un- 
fortunately the funds available have not permitted the fulfillment of 
this provision in many cases; by a supreme order of March, 1908, all 
schools in operation the year previous with an average attendance of 
less than 15 were closed. 
In general, the schools are separated according to sex, though in 
spite of the widespread prejudice against mixed schools a number of 
separate schools were converted into mixed schools at the beginning 
of the present year, chiefly for economical reasons. The relation of 
the sexes here is not very different from what one finds in southern 
Europe, and on account of the fears and prejudices of parents a 
“mixed school’ is very rarely coeducational in fact; for in most 
communities the sex that happens to predominate will attend, the 
other remaining at home; generally this is the lot of the girls. Even 
when both sexes attend, they are seated in different rooms and are 
instructed separately. Although the school age is from 6 to 12 for 
girls and 6 to 14 for boys, mixed schools can not legally receive boys 
over 10 years of age or girls of more than 12; still in many “mixed 
schools” where one sex is crowded out pupils are found over 15 years 
of age. 
The principals of boys’ schools are always men, though wome: 
teachers are frequently employed in the grades, while only women ma
-P-A-G-E-517
  EDUCATION IN PERU. 497 
have charge of or teach in mixed schools. Outside the larger cities 
not much interest has been awakened in the education of the girls, 
and it is no unusual thing to find, even in towns of from five to ten 
thousand inhabitants, no public provision whatever for the educa- 
tion of girls after completing the primary school. 
The ‘“‘reglamento’”’ provides for infant schools, or kindergartens, in 
the capitals of Provinces, but so far they have been organized in not 
more than a half dozen of the larger cities. They admit children 
from 4 to 6 years of age, who receive attention and instruction accord- 
ing to the principles of Frébel. 
School support.—Unfortunately no permanent funds have been set 
apart for the support of primary: education, although the Govern- 
ment still has numerous tracts of land in almost every Department 
that could be applied to that end. The organic law declares that 
5 per cent of the national revenues, 30 per cent of the departmental 
revenues, and all the excises placed on liquors shall be devoted to 
the maintenance of primary schools. On the whole this arrange- 
ment has not provided sufficient funds, but this may be due to the 
failure to collect and turn over all these funds. In any case the 
question of adequate school funds constitutes one of the problems of 
the proposed reorganization of the system. 
The total receipts were as follows:

1, 400, 000     1909 (estimated) ... 
  The course of study.—Although primary education comprises ac- 
cording to law but five years—two grades of two and three years, 
respectively—in practice it amounts to six years at least, since it is 
the custom to have a “complete” and an “incomplete’’ section in 
the first year of the first grade. Not infrequently the kindergarten 
as it is conducted is nothing else than a first year of school work. 
In the first grade the chief stress is naturally laid on the three R’s, 
the exact prescription being, for the first year, reading, writing, 
arithmetic, nature study, and religion (recitation of the catechism); 
in the second year, the same with elementary geography and the 
history of Peru, while moral instruction takes the place of religion. 
The second grade, comprising the third, fourth, and fifth years of 
instruction, continues these subjects, taking up besides in the third 
year Spanish, physics, chemistry, natural history, manual training 
(consisting of handwork with inventive geometry and drawing), music, 
physical exercises and hygiene; nature study being superseded by 
elementary agriculture and arboriculture; the moral instruction con- 
sists of the Christian dogma and sacred history and social duties. In

   the fourth year horticulture and drawing from nature are added to 
the preceding subjects, while the manual training begins to differ- 
entiate according to the sex of pupils, the girls taking up weaving, 
sewing, embroidering, and laundering, while the boys have elementary 
work in carpentering, blacksmithing, tailoring, shoemaking, and 
printing, according to the trades most in demand in the community. 
The fifth year is a continuation on the lines of the fourth, civic educa- 
tion taking the place of moral and religious instruction. 
It will be recognized that this course as it appears in print leaves” 
little to be desired, but in practice there are few schools that carry 
it out at all satisfactorily. The chief reason for this is that so few 
of the teachers are prepared to teach all these subjects, supplying 
the material and adapting it to the needs of the class (there are no 
good textbooks), so that many teach only the common branches and 
those not infrequently in the most indifferent manner. Again, it 
must be said that the course, as it is printed, is so condensed and 
abstractly presented, consisting of the barest outlines, that it is of 
very little help to the teachers, very few of them being able to elabo- 
rate the topics indicated. 
Although it is prohibited by the reglamento to teach reading by the 
letter and syllable methods, it is safe to say that in four-fiftlis of the 
schools these are the methods employed. It is also declared that 
arithmetic shall be taught by the objective method, but relatively 
few of the teachers really know what the objective method is and fewer 
still actually employ it successfully in their schools. All of which 
only shows that a competent person can soon make an excellent 
course of study, but it takes time to secure a body of teachers capable 
of making it a reality in the schools. ‘ 
Schoolhouses and supplies.—Public education is declared to be not 
only compulsory but free; the Government provides the schoolhouse 
and furniture and furnishes free of cost to the pupils of the first two 
years (the compulsory period) textbooks, pencils, tablets, pens, ete. 
This fact, together with the aim of the Government to provide a home 
for each teacher holding a permanent appointment, a gradual increase 
of salary, and retirement with a pension after 20 years of service, 
indicates something of the scope of the reforms initiated by the for- 
mer President Pardo in 1905. Owing to the lean years through 
which the Government is now passing, it has not been possible to 
fulfill to the letter all these aims. 
By a certain interpretation of the Organic Law of 1905, the school- 
houses provided by the municipalities during the period of decen- 
tralization preceding were to become the property of the Gov: 
ment, to be used for school purposes; yet in many towns the munici 
palities refuse to surrender the buildings, though generally permitting
-P-A-G-E-519
  
  EDUCATION IN PERU. 499 
their use by the schools. Unfortunately this matter has not been 
finally determined with the promptness its importance demands. 
Of the 1908 school buildings in use in 1909, 550 belonged to the 
Government and were valued at $410,199. Many buildings belonging 
to the Government and formerly used as prisons or barracks have 
been converted into schoolhouses, and too often without those modi- 
fications necessary to render them suitable for such purpose. The new 
buildings that have been constructed in Lima and Callao are models 
in arrangement and sanitary conditions, and it is regrettable that 
more. such buildings have not been constructed in all parts of the 
country. Owing to the straitened financial conditions all building 
has for the present ceased, and even the securing of suitable sites, 
which are fast doubling in value. The following table will be of 
interest as showing the amount spent in the construction and rent 
of schoolhouses:

In renting buildings the Government has unfortunately been 
obliged to sanction the use of a great many that are entirely unfitted 
for school purposes. In harmony with the recommendations of the 
Congress of Health and Hygiene, which met in Lima in 1899, the 
reglamento prescribes modern requirements as to the ventilation, 
lighting, and sanitation of schoolrooms, but, like numerous other 
excellent prescriptions, they have been realized in so few schools 
that the reglamento represents a goal toward which the education 
of the country is tending rather than a reality achieved. 
In the Department of Puno, situated in the sierra on Lake Titicaca, 
where the writer is familiar with conditions, there are 98 schools in 
session; of these, not more than 12 are in Government buildings, and 
a smaller number still possess the sanitary conditions required by the 
reglamento. In the rural schools, where nearly all the pupils are 
Indians or mestizos, it is no uncommon thing to find the one-room 
adobe building so small that the pupils do not pretend to enter, but 
study and recite in the open air. * * * 
To sum up, not one of these 98 buildings was constructed for school 
purposes, not over 10 have water-closets, and only a slightly larger 
number meet the commonest hygienic conditions demanded by tho 
reglamento. Practically all are constructed of adobe and have dirt 
floors, a few being provided with tiling or wooden floors. There are 
a few with sheet-iron roofs, and a considerable number with tiling,
-P-A-G-E-520
  500 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
while a great majority are covered with straw. There is no means of 
heating the buildings, as is the case in private houses also, the need not 
being very great, while the expense would be very high on account 
of the scarcity of fuel. 
In point of school furniture, maps, and other material, the schools 
are fairly well provided; at least a sufficient supply has been pur- 
chased by the central directorate, though often, on account of the 
negligence of local inspectors, the articles fail to reach their destination 
until years have passed, or never. In the last four years the follow- 
ing sums have been spent in purchasing and keeping in repair school 
material: 1906, $117,750; 1907, $66,530; 1908, $99,485;- 1909, 
$100,000 (estimated). * * * 
Statistics of attendance, etc.—There can be no doubt that in many 
respects decided improvements have resulted from the régime of 
centralization inaugurated five years ago, while at the same time 
difficulties almost insurmountable have been met, especially on 
account of the distance of many districts from Lima and the time lost 
in communicating with the central directorate. The following table, 
based upon the reports of the department of statistics, reveals the 
most important facts of the new movement in education during the 
last five years:

The distribution of the pupils of the elementary schools according 
to sex, age, race, and grade for the year 1909 was as follows: Boys, 
98,445; girls, 55,456; less than 6 years of age (both sexes), 5,489; 
between 6 and 14, 140,767; over 14 years of age, 7,645; white, 29,540; 
Indians, 50,959; mestizos, 78,720; negroes, 1,682. In the first grade 
(the first two years, the compulsory period), 146,461; in the second 
grade (the last three years of primary instruction), 7,440. 
There are many private schools, especially in the larger cities, of 
kindergarten, primary, and secondary grades. The number of pupils 
enrolled in such schools during the year 1909 was 24,202. 
Compulsory education.—For various reasons, chief among which is 
the predominance of the Indian element, the compulsory school law 
has remained almost a dead letter in Peru. In the first place, the 
enforcement of such a law requires an annual-register or census of
-P-A-G-E-521
EDUCATION IN PERU. 501 
children of school ‘age as a working basis for teachers and school 
authorities. Such a census has not been taken since 1902, so that 
the registration of school children from year to year has been far 
from complete. There being no systematic effort to enforce attend- 
ance, the number who have voluntarily received the elements of an 
education is small indeed, in many of the better towns not exceeding 
30 per cent of the children of school age. 
In the mountain districts, where the Indians constitute almost 
the entire population, conditions are worse still. The sowing and 
harvesting.seasons, .as they are managed, extend over months, so that 
the one furnishes an excuse for not sending the children during the 
summer semester and the other during the winter term. Taking into 
account that their scanty living depends entirely on the crops raised, 
it is almost impossible to enforce the fines the law provides. In 
other parts, where they could with greater justice be imposed, the 
political authorities on whom this depends fail in their duties and 
the inspector who insists on the enforcement of the law is in a fair 
way to get himself thoroughly disliked. 
The last school census, taken in 1902, showed 351,484 children 
of school age, or about one-half what it should have been, calculating 
the total population at 4,000,000, as it is claimed (no general census 
has been taken since 1872). Of these 351,484 children, in 1906, 
135,480 were enrolled in Government and 22,824 in private schools, 
or, together, 45 per cent of the school population. By the preceding 
table the average attendance is seen to be about one-half the enroll- 
ment, so that not over 23 per cent of the children of school age are 
actually in school. 
Teachers, certificates, salaries, etc.—Teachers are of three classes, 
according to the manner of appointment; that is, whether appointed 
by the provincial inspector, by the prefect of the Department from 
a list of three proposed by such inspector, or by the minister in Lima. 
The first class of appointment is temporary, the teachers being subject 
to removal or transfer at the will of the inspector; only the minister 
can remove or transfer a teacher of the second class, while those of 
the third class receive their appointments as the result of a competi- 
tive examination or on the basis of successful experience, and hold 
their position for life or until they are retired, except for flagrant 
misconduct. * * * 
Anyone who can read, write, and cipher a little may be appointed 
teacher of an elementary school, and not infrequently it is charged 
that the majority of the teachers of some remote Province are entirely 
illiterate, such a charge having just been made in the Congress against 
the teachers of the province of which the present minister of educa- 
tion is at the same time senator. Through the country, and espec- 
ially in the interior, persons competent to teach are scarce, and at 
 
-P-A-G-E-522
   
   502 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
times it is impossible to find such at all. The chief reason is the 
backwardness of education in general and the low salaries paid. 
During the years 1906, 1907, and 1908 the average salaries were 
$234, $235, $237, respectively; the few graduates of the men’s nor- 
mal school get $600 a year, those of the women’s normal schools from 
$270 to $480. Living expenses are about the same as in the United 
States, while imported articles cost nearly double what they do there. 
Under these conditions it is no great wonder that teaching is so little 
attractive to promising young men and women, most of the former 
entering the legal and medical professions in constantly increasing 
numbers. 
There are three grades of teachers’ certificates or diplomas, as they 
are called, but the majority of teachers are without certificates of any 
kind. The following data, taken from an article recently published 
by the head of the department of statistics, are to the point: ‘If we 
examine the conditions of the teachers of our schools, we see that 
according to the statistics of 1906, of the 2,768 in service in that 
year, 331 held certificates permitting them to teach in the first two 
years of elementary school and 736 were certificated for teaching in 
the next three years, 37 with university diplomas, and 1,674 without 
any certificate at all, or 60 per cent of the whole number.” 
The examination for teacher’s diploma is held by the departmental 
inspector, applicants being required to present certificates of having 
completed the primary school. In this work the inspector is assisted 
by two of the foremost teachers of the departmental capital. The 
examination consists of two parts, written and oral, the latter being 
based on the common branches, while in the first part the applicant 
writes on a topic related to teaching. It not infrequently happens 
that on account of the incompetence of the examiners, or of favor- 
itism, candidates are passed who really know very little of the sub- 
jects they propose to teach and less of correct methods. However, 
under the present régime the written work of the applicant is revised 
in Lima, which gives a certain uniformity and standard before 
unknown. All certificates are granted by the minister and without 
-term limit. * * * 
One of the reforms most urgently needed is in the certification and 
appointment of teachers in such a way as to discover and reward 
merit and stimulate all to improve themselves constantly and devote 
themselves exclusively to teaching. In the secondary schools the 
great majority of the teachers are lawyers, whose interests are not in 
teaching, but who are obliged to do that or something else in order to 
live while they are awaiting a clientele. Itis needless to suggest how 
unsatisfactory the results of such a practice must be. 
According to the law of 1905, any teacher who holds his school 
by permanent appointment, after serving 20 years, may be retired on     
 
-P-A-G-E-523
  
  EDUCATION IN PERU. 503 
half pay, provided that during that period he has contributed to 
the pension fund 4 per cent of his salary, which must be at least $25 
a month. : 
Inspection of schools—Provincial inspectors are appointed by the 
minister, the inspector of the Province in which the capital of the 
Department is located being ipso facto departmental inspector... By 
an official order last March, the number of inspectors was dimin- 
ished from more than 100 to 60, so that now nearly all have two or 
three Provinces each; at the same time the number of obligatory 
annual visits to each school was increased from two to three, which, 
considering the distances to be covered in the mountain section, is a 
physical impossibility or leaves no time for other work which is no 
less exacting. 
The chief duties of inspectors are appointing provincial teachers, 
supervising the instruction in the schools, setting the dates of the 
semiannual examinations, making up the annual budget which must 
be sent to Lima for final modification and approval, and presenting 
a detailed review once a year of the state of education in his depend- 
ey te * 
Without diminishing the importance and need of a thorough reor- 
ganization of the administrative system in harmony with the lessons 
learned by the experience of other countries and of ample provision 
of school funds, * * * it must be admitted that a fundamental 
need of the school system, and one that can not be quickly or easily 
supplied, is a body of competent and devoted teachers, together 
with a similar corps of inspectors or supervisors. 
NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
There are three normal schools in the country: One for each sex in 
Lima and one for women in Arequipa. The Men’s Normal of Lima 
has a two-years course, admits only pupils from 18 to 22 years of age 
who have finished secondary education; last year there were only 
42 students enrolled and only 11 were graduated. ‘There is also a 
preparatory section. The Women’s Normal of Lima has a three- 
year course and a preparatory section; the enrollment last year was 
100 students, and the number finishing the course, 12. The Women’s 
Normal in Arequipa has a two-year course with a preparatory sec- 
tion; the enrollment the past year was 89 and the number of gradu- 
ates 16. By way of summary, the whole number of graduates last 
year was 39, only slightly more than the number of teachers employed. 
At this rate, granting that the number of teachers in the country, 
about 3,000, would not increase, it would take three-quarters of a 
century to supply normal graduates as teachers. There is an out- 
spoken feeling that the number of graduates of these schools is not 
commensurate with their cost of maintenance, especially with refer-
-P-A-G-E-524
    504 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
ence to the Men’s Normal in Lima. Both normals in Lima are board- 
ing schools, the Government paying practically all living expenses of 
pupils in the Men’s Normal, by means of competitive scholarships. 
The director of the Men’s Normal in Lima and the directress of the 
normal in Arequipa are Belgians, are very competent, and have per- 
formed valuable service to the country. The director of the former 
school has just resigned in order to return home.* 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTE. 
The writer, who spent one year as inspector of schools of the 
Department of Puno, was soon convinced as a result of visits to the 
schools that the only way to reach the teachers and improve their 
work was to get them together during the vacation and give them a 
series of lectures on teaching, along with model lessons. A plan was 
presented to the minister of education and approved, and the first 
teachers’ institute in Peru was held in Puno, on the shore of Lake 
Titicaca in March, 1910. The attendance of teachers was voluntary, 
yet out of 102, 57 were enrolled, although some of them came over 
100 miles on horseback, paying ail their expenses, and on a salary of 
$15 a month. * * * 
I was informed by a number of persons that the institute would 
amount to nothing, that the few teachers who might come the first 
day would hardly return the next, and even the Directorate in Lima 
was very reluctant in approving such an unheard of venture, and in 
the end did so with certain limitations. But the institute proved a 
great success from the first day, the attendance increasing along with 
the enthusiasm until the last day, closing with a demonstration of 
entire satisfaction, and the desire was unanimous that another be 
held in the following vacation. The method of teaching reading by 
letters and syllables was completely routed in that six days’ work, 
the advantages of the sentence word method being demonstrated to 
the satisfaction of all. Naturally it devolved upon the writer to pre- 
pare a series of reading lessons suited to the new method, which in 
company with one of the leading normal graduates, was done; these 
lessons with copious instructions—for the change of method was like 
that of the Ptolemaic for the Copernican system of astronomy—were 
printed and sent regularly to the teachers of the Department. The 
results, considering the absolute lack of professional preparation on 
the part of many of the teachers, were far more satisfactory than 
I thought possible to achieve in ‘so short a time, thanks to the 
good will and determination of the teachers to follow instructions 
fegiuly. ** *

   The idea has found such acceptance with the authorities that at — 
least three institutes will be held in the leading departments in the 
following summer vacation, which occurs in January and February. 
Doubtless some means will be found to reward or compel attendance, 
which could be done with justice, since teachers receive their salaries 
during the vacation months. 
SECONDARY, HIGH, AND SPECIAL EDUCATION. 
Pupils who finish the five years of elementary education are pre- 
pared to enter the four-year course of intermediate education, which 
corresponds somewhat closely to our high school course, though 
pupils enter one or two years younger. 
This education is carried on in 27 Government schools called ‘“Cole- 
gios,” 3 of which are for girls exclusively, located in Cuzco, Trujillo, 
and Ayucucho, respectively. Only recently the others may admit 
young ladies, but so far it is safe to say that not over 1 per cent of 
the students are girls, so strong is the prejudice against coeducation 
in any form. The number of teachers in these secondary schools for 
last year (1909) was 551, and the number of pupils enrolled was 3,872. 
The course of study is uniform throughout the country. It pro- 
vides 25 recitation periods a week, besides three additional hours of 
physical drill during the last year. The first year (or pupils from 
12 to 13 years of age) comprises the following subjects: Spanish, 
geography, fundamentals of dogma, English or French, arithmetic, 
penmanship, general history, zoology, drawing and music. 
The second year is the same except that the five weekly periods 
for mathematics are distributed in the proportion of one, two, and 
two among arithmetic, algebra, and geometry, while botany takes 
the place of zoology. 
In the third year the four hours of mathematics are divided equally 
between algebra and geometry, while in place of botany, mineralogy 
land geology receive two hours, physics three hours, and chemistry 
three hours with one hour of laboratory work. 
In the fourth year (students from 15 to 16 years of age) the 
athematics consists of trigonometry and surveying; anatomy and 
hysiology take the place of geology and mineralogy; physics and 
hhemistry continue with reduced periods, while five hours of philoso- 
hy and one of civics are added. The only option is between English 
nd French, to which three weekly periods are devoted in each of 
he first three years and two periods the last year. 
On the whole the subjects are well outlined in the course, but the 
umber of subjects is obviously excessive.

    Of universities there are four: San Marcos, in Lima;' San Antonio 
Abad, in Cuzco; San Augustin, in Arequipa; and San Thomas and 
Santa Rosa, in Trujillo. The first is called a major university, the 
rest minor. In all four there were in 1909, professors, 149; students, 
1,088. 
At the end of three years’ study one may receive the A. B. degree; 
the faculties represented in the University of Lima and the number 
of years required for graduation are as follows: Medicine, 7 years; 
pharmacy, 3; theology, 6; law, 5; political sciences, 3; philosophy 
and. letters, 3; and mathematics and natural sciences, 3.. In the 
Universities of Arequipa and Cuzco there are faculties of law, polit- 
ical science, letters, and natural science; in that of Trujillo, only let- 
ters and law. 
The middle schools are supported by national and departmental 
subsidies, income from their properties, and tuition of the pupils, the 
last source furnishing about 25 per cent of the entire income, which 
in 1907 amounted to $271,675; in 1908. to $306,220. The universi- 
ties are supported by national subsidies, incomes from their proper- 
ties, and the tuition of students, which latter item amounts in Lima 
to 10 per cent of all incomes; in Arequipa to 15 per cent; in Cuzco 
to 25 per cent; and in Trujillo to 30 per cent. The latest total 
income reported for the universities was for the year 1906, the amount 
being $179,820. : 
The special schools are those of arts and trades, engineering, and 
agriculture and veterinary science, all of which are located in Lima. 
The first comprises the furniture and carpet trades, mechanics, elec- 
tricity, city and industrial constructions, and the graphic arts. - Th 
school of engineering has a preparatory section of two years, followed 
by others of different length, as constructions, two years; mines, 
three years; industries, three years; and electricity, one year. Th 
school of agriculture and veterinary science has a preparatory sec 
tion of one year, followed by another and special section of thre 
years. These schools are not subject to the minister of education bu 
to the minister of propagandas. 
FOREIGN TEACHERS IN PERU. 
South American countries have long been accustomed to emplo: 
foreign teachers, chiefly with the hope of overcoming the inheren 
inertia of the races. Chile owes much to the influence of a numbe 
of German teachers whom she has maintained at the head 
  
1A recent report from Mr. W. Henry Robertson, American consul general at Callao, includes the fo} 
lowing: ‘‘ The few lectures given during the past year by Prof. Felipe Barreda Laos, of the faculty of le 
ters of the University of San Marcos of Lima, on the literature of the United States, proved so populj 
that the university faculty have just voted that he give a regular, prescribed course of instruction 
this subject in the ensuing scholastic year. This is said to be the first time such a course has been mas 
a part of the curriculum of a South American univei Ep.

her educational institutions; likewise Argentina owes much of her 
educational glory to a band of American teachers brought down a 
little more than a generation ago. For more than 40 years Peru 
has employed in a number of her middle schools, German teachers, 
who have rendered excellent service. At the present time two of 
her three normal schools are in charge of Belgian directors, as is also 
the Agricultural School. There are also a number of Frenchmen in 
teaching positions under the Government, while the director of the 
principal secondary school of the country is a Swiss. 
About three years ago some of the educational leaders of the 
country began to turn their gaze toward the Grand Republic of the 
North, as the United States is frequently called, believing firmly that 
the type of education so rapidly developed there in recent years was 
what was needed to put new life blood into the anemic school system 
of Peru. At first a lady inspector was employed for the girls’ schools 
of Lima and Callao, Miss Grace Carnahan, of St. Louis. Miss Carna- 
han is a young woman of ability and energy, who had served in Porto 
Rico and knew Spanish; consequently from the start her work was 
_ very successful and rightly appreciated. 
In May, 1909, the Peruvian Government sent a special educa- 
tional agent to the United States to engage a number of teachers 
and inspectors, as also a specialist in educational administration. 
For this post Dr. H. E. Bard, who had seen service in the Philippines, 
was selected; and Mr. J. B. Lockey, of Florida, and the writer, then 
students in Teachers’ College, New York, were employed es inspec- 
tors. Shortly afterwards three young women were engaged for teach- 
ing positions; for various reasons these have since returned to the 
“States.” Dr. Bard, who was consulting expert to the minister of 
education, had also acted as inspector of the boys’ schools of Lima 
and Callao. He was relieved of the latter function in July last in 
order that he might devote all his time to: the study of the educa- 
tional situation of the country. He was made secretary of a special 
educational commission, appointed last May, to prepare a bill for 
submission to the next Congress which shall have for its object the 
reorganization of the school system. Mr. Lockey, who had served 
as inspector in Trujillo, was called to Lima as departmental inspector. 
Whether the American educational mission will meet expectations 
fully remains yet to be seen, as much of the year and a half that has 
elapsed has been necessary. to learn the language and get acquainted 
with conditions. In spite of the difficulties to be overcome and the 
immense amount of work that is to be done, there is every reason to 
be encouraged. From the President of the Republic down to the 
last teacher or district inspector, there is the best of good will for our 
undertaking and a sincere desire to cooperate in the reforms that 
are to be inaugurated.

I. GENERAL CONDITIONS. 
[A recent report of this office presents an extended survey of educa- 
tion in the Argentine Republic, comprising statistics of primary 
education derived from oflicial reports for 1907.1. For the following 
later information, based upon the educational census of 1909, the 
Office is indebted to Mr. Charles Lyon Chandler, vice consul at 
Buenos Aires. | 
The first Argentine educational census was taken in 1884, and the 
national census of 1895 was also an educational one. That of May 
25, 1909, however, is not merely far more concise and complete than 
any of its predecessors, but is said to be the most complete statement 
of its educational status ever issued by a Latin-American country. 
In 1881, $33,295 (United States currency) was spent on primary 
education by the Argentine Government; in 1907 it was $3,566,403, 
lor over 100 times as much. The average at present is $3,500,000 a 
year. In all, the Government spent $10,898,674 on education in 
909—as much as on the Army and Navy combined. Of all sums 
pent by the Government in 1908, 11.84 per cent was on education, a 
roportion only exceeded by that on the public debt (18.08 per cent) 
nd on public works (12.96 per cent). On primary education alone 
29,276,090 has been spent since 1881. In 1895 there were 3,325 
rimary schools, with 285,854 pupils; in 1909 there were 5,321, with 
14,680, an increase of 60 per cent and of 115 per cent, respectively. 
here were 18,571 primary teachers in 1909, and 42 normal schools 
ith 2,186 teachers.

HIGHER SCHOOLS AND SPECIAL EDUCATION. 
As for secondary instruction, there were 26 “ colegios nacionales,” 
preparing for the three national universities, with 812 teachers. 
They are well distributed over the Republic. About $400,000 a year 
is spent on the 6 commercial high schools, which had 1,921 students in 
1909. These schools are very popular, and their attendance is rapidly. 
increasing; 850 graduates leave the four professional schools for 
women yearly. 
There are in addition schools for deaf-mutes, a national school of 
chemistry at San Juan, a normal school of physical education, a 
national lycée for girls, and a national institution for training teach- 
ers for secondary instruction. There is said to be more provision for 
the education cf women in Argentina than in any other South Ameri- 
can country, and too much credit can not be given to the devoted 
army of ladies brought from the United States to Argentina by 
President Sarmiento (1868-1874 and subsequently) who, with the 
constant encouragement and assistance of the Argentine Government 
and people, have made this possible. 
The Latin-American States are all esseftially agricultural; and in 
the general movement for the spread of education in its most effec- 
tive forms, provision for agricultural training commands attention. 
This is especially true in respect to the Argentine Republic. 
The first law relating to the subject was promulgated in 1870, and 
the following year a course of instruction in agriculture was estab- 
lished in the three national colleges, Tucuman, Salta, and Mendoza. 
The course at Mendoza was maintained for several years, but very 
little was accomplished by this early effort, and in 1907 a commission, 
was appointed under the minister of agriculture to inquire into the| 
subject and to advise as to means of promoting this important form 
of education throughout the Republic. The outcome of the work 
of the commission was the law of December 27, 1907, providing fo: 
the establishment of central schools of agriculture; by a decree o: 
February 19, 1908, five practical schools of agriculture were author 
ized. These were soon established and well equipped for their pur: 
pose. ‘The final stage in this development was the transfer in 190! 
of the higher school of agriculture and veterinary science, which 
had been organized at Buenos Aires in 1904, to the control of th 
University of Buenos Aires. In its new relation the school was in 
vested with the character of a university faculty. The faculty has a 
its disposal a large experimental farm. 
In 1906 a provincial institute of agronomy and veterinary medi 
cine, which, as early as 1870, had been established and endowed wit 
a valuable property in Santa Catalina, was incorporated with th 
National University of La Plata, and became the experimental ir

stitute of the faculty of agronomy in that. institution. This high 
recognition of the importance of agriculture and its scientific rela- 
_tions has had a stimulating effect upon the regional schools, which 
are operating effectually and with valuable results. 
       
   
                                                  
      
   
     
    II. LA PLATA UNIVERSITY. 
By Ernesto. NELSON, 
Head master of the La Plata University School. 
All through South America the universities are more or less shaped 
after the old style, both in regard to the curriculum and to material 
equipment. 
La Plata U: niversity, in kerpdittine Republic, the newest South 
American university, is shaped rather after the modern American 
idea of a university. It occupies an extended area, far from the big 
cities, which heretofore have been the location more commonly sought 
for by the large institutions of this kind. 
The sites, buildings, and collections of this university represent 
about $10,000,000, and its yearly expenditure is about $1,000,000. 
The grounds cover an aggregate of 2,000 acres, distributed at La 
Plata and Santa Catalina, in the State of Buenos Aires. 
The principal departments of the institution are the law school, 
agricultural school, school of mathematics, school of biology, peda- 
gogical department, and a secondary or preparatory school. 
The law school makes a departure from the old idea that this part 
of the university is concerned only with the training of lawyers for 
the bar and with the discussion of codes and existing legislation. At 
La Plata the emphasis is laid upon the study of sociology and his- 
tory, rather than of existing legislation. 
Following this policy, the University of La Plata has secured the 
cooperation of Europeans who are recognized authorities in respect 
to sociological questions. Prof. Ferri, the great Italian reformer, 
whose teachings, together with those of Lombroso, have revolution- 
ized penal systems throughout the civilized world, has given two 
series of lectures at the University of La Plata, in which he presented 
his views on penal law. Prof. Altamira, of Spain, a leader in the 
movement for university extension and popular education, is also a 
familiar presence at the University of La Plata, in which he has 
recently given a series of lectures on the teaching of history. 
Among other savants from Europe who have given courses at 
ua Plata are Prof. Vallee, the eminent bacteriologist, and Prof. 
osada, distinguished by his studies on sociology. 
The astronomical department of the university has shared in the 
mportant work concerning the study of the southern sky. It has 
iven a great impetus to the study of physical phenomena in the  
-P-A-G-E-532

southern part of this continent and has established meteorological 
and magnetic stations in different parts of Argentine, at the same 
time cooperating with scientific institutions of Europe and the United 
States. 
The pedagogical department aims at scientific research in educa- 
tion and child study, and has well equipped laboratories and an 
experimental primary school. 
The secondary department bridges the gap between the university 
and the elementary grades and so completes the whole educational 
cycle. This is the only instance in South America of a university 
universal in its scope and work. 
The secondary department has also developed the modern idea that 
boys should live with boys while they are educated, and by so doing 
the university has upset the current ideas about boarding-school life 
in Latin America. It is a fact that while religion is not taught in 
schools, the Catholic boarding schools, both for young men and young 
women, are much in favor and patronized by the wealthy classes. 
At La Plata the boys live in pleasant surroundings, have plenty of 
opportunities for sport and physical exercises, and are given a full 
share in the enjoyments of life. 
Instead of following the American idea of having separate build- 
ings for dormitories and dining halls, the University of La Plata 
has developed the home-unit idea by having separate residences, each 
of which accommodates about 35 students, and contains a dining hall, 
a kitchen, a clubroom, a library, etc., besides individual bedrooms for 
each of the inmates. It is also this department of the university that 
had the novel idea of sending a group of boy students on a vacation 
trip through Europe and the United States. As this was a tentative 
experiment, the group consisted of five students only, but this number 
will be increased in following years. 
Ill. PUBLIC INSTRUCTION.' 
[Translation of passage concerning public instruction in the message of the 
President of the Argentine Republic read before the national assembly on 
May 12, 1911.) 
The Executive Power regards public instruction under two com- 
plementary aspects, to wit: The reform of the general plans of edu- 
cation, and the proper management of national institutes and col- 
leges. It is fair to acknowledge, in regard to the first question, thai 
the multiplicity of provisions in force concerning secondary instruc: 
tion is detrimental to the directing unity of these studies. It i 
necessary to make them uniform by means of logical and _lastin,   
1 Furnished for the Commissioner’s report by the Pan-American Union.
-P-A-G-E-533
  
  EDUCATION IN ARGENTINE REPUBLIC. 513 
legislation, leaving the details requiring constant innovations to be 
governed by regulations. As soon as the first symptoms indicating 
the existence of irregularities were noticed a careful investigation was 
started under a spirit of strict severity and justice, and in this respect 
the President assures that all causes, as well as all factors, of disturb- 
ance, shall be eliminated. 
The decree of December last, placing the normal schools under the 
jurisdiction of the National Council of Education, is equivalent to 
returning them to the situation created by the law of July, 1884, and 
the decree of April, 1893. Nothing is more logical than placing the 
institutions where teachers are trained under the care of the depart- 
ment which watches over elementary instruction. The curricula, the 
pedagogic ideas, the disciplinary regulations, the mental and moral . 
supervision over the teaching personnel should be centralized so as to 
respond to the same orientation and purpose of primary instruction 
that the unity of thought requires. 
In October last there were inaugurated 468 primary schools, mak- 
ing a total of 2,067 institutions of this kind; but this number is far 
below the demands of the people, and every effort should be made to 
increase the number of schools and colleges.

EDUCATION IN CHILE. 
    
     
                     
           
     
   
    
   
         
      [Derived from report by A. A. Winslow, American consul at Valparaiso.) 
The public schools of Chile are under the direct supervision of the 
Government, and all appropriations for public instruction are made 
from the general funds of the Government, and are apportioned by 
an act of Congress. There is a Minister of Public Instruction, with 
a seat in the President’s cabinet, aided by a Council of Public Instruc- 
tion, and surrounded by a corps of inspectors and assistants at 
Santiago, with local organizations in the principal cities and capitals 
of Provinces. 
Much has been accomplished during the past five years by the Gov- 
ernment in advancing educational interests and in bringing the pub- 
lic schools to a higher standard. Many new buildings have been 
erected and old ones remodeled and refurnished. At present there 
are a large number of new buildings under construction. 
The first free public school was opened in Santiago in 1813. Chile 
mow has 2,475 primary schools, 72 high schools, and 16 normal schools, 
ito say nothing of the several Government institutions for higher edu- 
cation. At first the progress was rather slow, for during 1850 the 
overnment expended only $224,662 (U.S. gold) for public educa- 
‘ion, and for 1900 the amount reached but $2,681,719, while for 1909 
he total appropriation amounted to $9,000,156, with a total attend- 
nee of 240,591 children. 
Of the 2,475 primary schools in 1909, there were 787 city and town 
chools, attended by 69,413 children, and 1,688 country schools, at- 
ended by 138,326 children. Of the schools, 355 were held in build- 
ngs owned by the Government, 1,839 in rented buildings, and 281 in 
coms provided by the patrons of the schools. 
The following table gives a very fair idea of the course covered in 
e primary public schools of Chile.* 
  
1The number of subjects and the total hours a week, as given in the above table and 
the corresponding tables for secondary and normal schools, are excessive and give 
ound for the constant complaint of teachers and school authorities in Chile that the 
‘ograms are overcrowded and can not be carried out. Reform in this respect is recog- 
ized as indispensable. [Ed.]

Children may enter the primary schools at the age of 5 years; but 
few are found in these schools at the age of 14, and many pass to the 
high schools after reaching the age of 10, the minimum age at which 
children are allowed to enter. During 1909 there were 26,875 boys 
and 29,864 girls in the primary schools from 5 to 7 years, 42,150 boys 
and 42,451 girls from 8 to 10, with 31,832 boys and 37,640 girls from 
11 to 13, while there were but 5,723 boys and 9,727 girls in the schools 
over 18 years of age. 
The 2,475 primary schools have 591 male and 1,926 female teachers, 
with 607 male and 1,546 female assistants. Of the 787 city schools, 
166 are for boys, 184 for girls, and 201 for both boys and girls, while 
of the 1,688 country schools, 330 are for boys, 133 for girls, and 1,225 
for both boys and girls. 
SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
The 39 secondary schools for boys (liceos) were in charge of 598 
teachers, of whom 31 were German, 10 French, 7 English, 7 Italian, 
2 American, and 518 Chilean. The following table, showing the num- 
ber of hours a week for each study, covers quite fully the work in th

There are 6 normal schools for men, with an attendance of 883 in 
1909, and a corps of 115 teachers, of whom 7 were German, 1 Aus- 
trian, and 1 French. From the beginning, German methods have 
predominated in the normal schools of the country. The following

The 10 normal schools for women had an attendance during 1909 
of 1,316, with a corps of 35 male teachers, of whom 5 were German, 
2 Spanish, and 1 French; and 147 female teachers, of whom 6 were 
German, 1 French, 4 English, 1 American, and 2 Swiss. The at- 
tendance at the normal school for women is better during the last 
two years of the course than at the normal for men. Below is given

COMMERCIAL EDUCATION. 
The interest in commercial education, which has been noted in 
former reports of this series, continues, and schools of this character 
have been established in 10 cities of Chile through the combined

efforts of the Government and of municipal and private enterprise. 
In 1909 the staff of these schools comprised foreign teachers as fol- 
lows: Six German, 1 Spanish, 1 Swiss, 6 English, and 3 from the 
United States. The following table and context comprised in the 
report by Mr. Winslow shows a week’s program for each year of the 
course in the commercial schools:

The principal instructors in the military school at Santiago are 
German, and German methods prevail. In the naval school at Val- 
paraiso nearly everything is English The Government has just 
engaged four English instructors for this school for the coming year, 
1911. 
The public schools of Chile are ably supplemented by a number 
of private schools conducted by foreigners, where many boys and 
girls from the best Chilean families receive most of their education. 
Many of the graduates from these private schools become teachers in 
the public schools. Several of the private schools are mission schools, 
and among them are a girls’ college at Santiago, sustained by the 
Methodist Episcopal foreign mission board, and a large college for 
boys, supported by the Presbyterian foreign mission board. These, 
with others of lesser importance, are accomplishing much, and are 
greatly appreciated by the Chileans.

I. GREAT BRITAIN. 
WIDESPREAD ACTIVITY. 
The year has been marked by decided activity in regard’ to educa- 
tion in both divisions of Great Britain and on the part of all the 
agencies by which the progress of this public interest is promoted. 
In Scotland this activity has been directed mainly toward carrying 
out the provisions of the law of 1908 in respect to new responsibili- 
ties placed upon school boards. These provisions related to the ex- 
tension of the period of compulsory school attendance and to care 
for the physical welfare of school children. The latter purpose 
has for some time engaged the efforts of the principai school boards, 
and these are furnishing important lessons in the conduct of the 
521 
   
-P-A-G-E-542
  522 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
medical and hygienic inspection of schools. This work has developed 
not in cities alone, but in entire counties. 
Scotland has also led in measures for helping pupils at the end of 
their school life to find suitable employment, a movement which has 
spread throughout the Kingdom and is proving of great economic, 
as well as humanitarian, importance. 
In England the movement in education is deeply involved with 
vested interests and political antagonisms, and as every important 
measure affecting the interest is discussed in Parliament, where all 
the controlling forces—the local authorities, the great educational 
associations, as well as political parties—have representation, the con- 
troversy becomes intense at every stage of progress. In no other 
country of the world is the educational situation so complete a reflex 
of political life. ; 
The growth of Government activity in education is a striking fact 
in the social development now taking place in Great Britain. It is 
shown by the treasury grants for education, which are steadily in- 
creasing, with a corresponding increase in the directive and super- 
visory work of the Government. The education vote for the year 
1910-11 carried a total grant of £16,843,356 and for 1911-12 a total 
of £17,296,608, or, expressed in United States equivalents, $81,858,710 
and $84,061,514. These totals include grants to universities and col- 
leges and grants for the promotion of science and art, but the greater 
part of the money, above 96 per cent, is for public, or elementary, 
schools. England, with its population of 36,075,000, absorbed for 
this purpose above fourteen millions in 1910-11 ($68,353,967). The 
grant for public education in Scotland the same year was £2,253,725 
($10,953,104). 
The treasury appropriations quoted cover about half the expendi- 
ture for public education; local taxes contribute nearly the same 
amount, and, with receipts from miscellaneous sources, make up a 
little more than half the entire cost of public schools in both divisions 
of the Kingdom. 
In England the growing force of democracy is indicated by the 
breaking down of barriers between the public elementary schools and 
the older secondary schools, through their common participation in 
public funds. As will be seen by reference to details comprised in 
this chapter, particularly by Tables 4—6, inclusive, the financial rec- 
ords of elementary education and of the higher departments are still 
kept separate, but in the discussions of the vital matter of income 
the two interests are rapidly becoming inseparable. 
It is interesting to recall, in this connection, that in 1902, when the 
new education act was passed for England, the Government was

   appropriating for its elementary schools a little over £8,000,000; 
hence in less than a decade the treasury appropriation tor this pur- 
pose has increased by nearly 75 per cent. 
The Government grants do not indicate simply, as in earlier years, 
awakened convictions of national need on the part of a few earnest 
leaders, but insistent public demands which Parliament must heed. 
The change in this respect in England, the growth of a strong and 
diffused public opinion in support of popular education, is much 
more striking than the enlarged appropriations for the service. 
Public opinion in England tends always to organize itself around 
established interests, whence arise the number of educational associ- 
ations, all vigorously engaged in advancing the special services which 
they represent. There-is no common arena of discussion like that of 
the Educational Institute of Scotland, which covers the whole field. 
But it is noticeable that with the increasing conviction in England 
that education must have free course among the people, there is a 
growing sense of the oneness of its purposes and processes. This 
feeling has given rise to the many recent conferences touching aspects 
of the subject that transcend the limits of particular grades of 
instruction. The most important of such conferences during the cur- 
rent year were the rural education conference, held July 14 under the 
auspices of the board of agriculture and the board of education, and 
the imperial education conference. The latter was convened by the 
Government in April, preceding by two months the coronation cere- 
monies. The arrangements for the conference were made through 
the combined agency of the board of education, the colonial office, and 
the India office, in accordance with plans outlined at the close of the 
Federal Education Conference of 1907. 
The imposing assembly, which met for the opening session April 
25 of the present year, comprised representatives of every division of 
the Kingdom, including the colonies and overseas dominions. The 
significance of the conference lies chiefly in the fact of its assembly 
and in the indications it gave of the presence of similar forces work- 
ing out by subtle processes a union of peoples stronger than the mere 
bonds of government. The morning sessions of the conference were 
private; for the afternoon sessions, which were devoted to the open 
discussion of educational problems, the participation of represent- 
atives of 14 universities and 55 educational associations of Great 
Britain was invited. Among matters which received general assent 
the most important were propositions looking to “arrangements for 
the mutual recognition of teachers’ certificates,” for the “ recruiting 
lof candidates for educational appointments in the overseas domin- 
ions, including India,” and for “promoting uniform schemes for 
reporting similar data.” A motion for the establishment of an 
 
-P-A-G-E-544

524 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
“Imperial Education Bureau” was modified to a request for “such 
extension ” of the services of the board of education “as will meet the 
needs of the various education departments of His Majesty’s domin- 
ions.” It was also recommended that the several education depart- 
ments of the Empire should prepare and print monographs on cur- 
ricula, training of teachers, compulsory attendance, education of 
children in sparsely populated districts, and medical inspecticn, 
accompanied by an “ accurate record of the exact meaning attached to 
the several technical terms used by the various education departments 
| in the presentation of their statistics.” 
The last recommendation bears upon a well-recognized need; with- 
out common terms and statistical uniformity, exact comparative 
| studies of education are impossible, but the interchange of experiences 
| is certainly not less important as a stimulus to new and renewed 
exertions. This is the conviction that furnishes the motive for edu- 
cational congresses and conferences which crowd rapidly upon each 
other, and among which the Imperial Conference has preeminent po- 
litical significance for the different members of the Empire. 
| The political entanglements of the English system of education 
serve to emphasize what may be called its national as distinguished 
from its local and professional bearing. Hence its special interest to 
our own country, where there are great problems of education yet to 
be settled which must be approached from the standpoint of national 
welfare. 
Among the events of the year must be included the “ Tercentenary 
of the King James’s version of the English Bible,” which was cele- 
brated in all English-speaking countries. A feature of the celebra- 
tion in England was the gathering of a delegation at Buckingham 
Palace, March 21, for the presentation of a Bible to King George. 
The schools of the country were represented in that assembly by the 
president of the National Union of Teachers and by the chairman of 
the Head Masters’ Conference. The significance of the event for 
those engaged in the work of education was expressed by the Arch- 
bishop of Canterbury, who, in the presentation address, character- 
ized the Bible as an “ inestimable blessing bestowed upon the Englis 
speaking people by its translation into our mother-tongue and its 
influence in the molding of our national life.” Of that influence    
he said: 
It has sweetened home life; it has set a standard of pure speech; it has per- 
meated literature and art; it has helped to remove social wrongs and to amelio- 
rate conditions of labor; it has modified the laws of the realm and shaped the 
national character, and it has fostered international comity and good will among 
men.

  EDUCATIONAL MOVEMENTS IN GREAT BRITAIN. 525 
The educational section of the British Association, which met at 
Portsmouth in the month of August, maintained the high level which 
has characterized the proceedings of this section since its organization 
in 1906. The opening address was delivered by the Right Rev. J. E. C. 
Welldon, Dean of Manchester, whose theme, “ Educational Prob- 
lems of the Day,” was treated with constant reference to a democratic 
conception of education in modern States. The principles on which 
such a conception is based were enunciated by him briefly as follows: 
That every child shall enjoy the opportunity of developing in full measure 
the intellectual and moral faculties with which God has endowed him or her. 
That no difference of opportunity, or as little difference as possible, shall 
exist between the richer and the poorer classes of society. 
That the supreme object of education is to provide good citizens—citizens who, 
in Milton’s stately language, will be able to “perform justly, skillfully, and 
magnanimously all the offices, both public and private, of peace and war.” 
That as the personal influence of the teacher is a potent factor in education, 
it is the business of the State to insure the highest possible efficiency, not only 
of intelligence, but of character, in the men and women who adopt the educa- 
tional profession as their life work. 
EXPANDING SCOPE OF THE ENGLISH SYSTEM. 
A closer examination of the details of the year’s record emphasizes 
the main distinction between the two divisions of the United King- 
dom. In Scotland the foundations of a broad national system were 
firmly laid on the lines of the older parish system by the education 
act of 1872. On the contrary, the English act of 1870 was concerned 
only with elementary education of a narrow scope, and it was by a 
liberal construction of its terms that the school boards of the large 
cities broke through its bounds. The act of 1902 provided for an 
upward expansion that is limited only by the disposition of the local 
authorities and by the restriction of the tax they may levy for edu- 
cation other than elementary. The variety of schools and higher 
institutions that have been drawn within one administrative system 
by this later act and the growth of the different divisions for the last 
three years reported are indicated by the data given in Table 1.1

PUBLIC ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. 
The different classes of schools comprised in the foregoing table 
are not closely coordinated, and elementary education forms, as it 
were, a division within a system rather than the basis of a system. 
At the same time the bonds of union between the different divisions 
are increasing, and the main problems of elementary education which 
will claim attention here are more and more complicated with those 
of secondary and technical education. 
The schools termed “ public elementary ” in Table 1 are now classed 
“council or provided ”—that is, provided by the councils, munici- 
pal and county—which have taken the place of the former board 
schools and voluntary or nonprovided schools. The boards of man- 
agers for the latter must include, in addition to the foundation 
managers, a number of members appointed by the local authorities 
in the proportion of 2 to 4. (Act 1902, Pt. III, sec. 6 (2).) The 
nonprovided schools share in the Government grant, and also in the 
local taxes on the same terms as the provided schools. The number 
of public elementary schools (England and Wales) in 1910 was, in 
round numbers, 21,700, having an enrollment of about 6,000,000 
pupils and employing a force of 161,000 adult teachers. (See Tables 
2 and 4.) The Government grant meets 49 per cent of the cost of 
the schools (Tables 5 and 6), and local sources, chiefly rates (taxes), 
and borough appropriations the remaining 51 per cent. The ex- 
penditure for elementary education reached in 1909 the total of 
$110,784,545. (See Table 7.)
-P-A-G-E-547
  
    EDUCATIONAL MOVEMENTS IN GREAT BRITAIN. 527 
The distribution of pupils under the different types of local authori- 
ties, as shown in Table 3, emphasizes the excess of urban populations 
in England. Cities and urban districts furnish about 64 per cent 
of the school enrollment and a much larger proportionate share of 
the school expenditures. (See Table 8.)

528 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
THE FINANCIAL PROBLEM. 
Local authorities are obliged by law to establish and maintain 
schools; they engage and pay the teachers and have absolute control 
of the schools, excepting as regards conditions for sharing in the 
Government grant. These conditions are determined by the board 
of education, which thus makes its power felt in the internal conduct 
of the schools. When the conditions impose extra duties upon school 
authorities the claim is made that the Government should increase its 
aid; at the same time, additional duties, for instance those of med- 
ical inspection, bear more heavily upon some local authorities than 
upon others; so that to the complaint of the financial burden on the 
part of the local authorities is added that of financial inequality. 
In the debate on the education estimates for 1911, as submitted 
to the House of Commons, the fact was brought out that, whereas 
in the decade ending in 1902 the Government grant bore 61 per cent 
of the expenditure on elementary education, the preportion has since 
fallen to 49 per cent. By the relative decline in the grants and the 
increase in expenditure, the local authorities in 1909 were “ £1,000,000 
worse off than they were two years before.” 
It was urged that Government should increase its proportion of the 
cost and that measures should be taken to equalize the burden of the 
school tax. The differences in this respect are great. In some places 
the rates (local taxes) contribute only 15 per cent of the school ex- 
penditure; in London they contribute 70 per cent. Often, where the 
rates are least the wealth is greatest and the need is least; and again, 
where the rates are highest the wealth is least; and yet, in the latter 
communities there is immense demand for the work the education 
authorities have to do for the general child welfare. The official 
report shows that the education rate varies from 24 pence (5 cents) 
in the pound to 27.6 pence (56 cents). The average for different 
types of local authorities in 1909 was as follows: 
Average rate for education

  530 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
THE PROBLEM OF THE TRAINED TEACHER. 
The problem of securing trained and competent teachers for ele- 
mentary schools, always a difficult one to solve, has reached an acute 
stage in England at the present time. The official regulations require 
that the head teacher of a school shall be certificated, and efforts are 
constantly put forth by the board of education to increase the pro- 
portion of certificated or trained teachers in the lower positions. 
But the number of duly trained candidates increases more rapidly 
‘than appointments can be secured. Two causes are assigned for 
this inequality between supply and demand. (1) The multiplica- 
tion, of training colleges; (2) the narrow policy of local authori- 
ties, indicated by exclusive employment of local candidates and by 
the meager salaries offered. During the debate over the budget the 
president of the board strongly defended the policy of the Govern- 
ment in encouraging an increase in the number of training colleges. 
In this connection, he declared that the new colleges had taken up 
the work with enthusiasm; that the universities by their provision for 
the training of teachers had imparted an entirely new spirit to the 
profession, while, at the same time, the religious restrictions imposed 
by the old denominational colleges had been broken down by the re- 
quirement that half the number of their places must be free to all 
suitable candidates as a condition for sharing in the parliamentary 
grants. Out of a total of 4,800 places in denominational colleges, 
half are free, a change which has been made without detriment to 
the religious character of the colleges, and this number, together with 
something over 7,000 in undenominational colleges, makes a total of 
10,000 free places open to intending teachers. 
With regard to the number of certificated teachers looking in vain 
for positions, Mr. Runciman attributed this to the fact that the 
“local education authorities are drawing far too much from their own 
districts.” He urged also that the new training colleges, which are 
mostly provided by municipal authorities, should endeavor to give a 
definite rural bias to their training, so that students could be pre- 
pared in them for places in rural districts. In this connection he 
said:     
                                          
    
   
        
      
     
      Two years ago I offered grants for an extra year if any students wer 
willing to stay on to obtain horticulture, agricultural, or some other like in- 
struction—something closely in touch with the tastes and principles of rural 
schools and rural teachers. I suggested that that should be done at the Swan. 
ley College. I am sorry to say that not one single person applied for it. Wi 
shall have to find out how it is that teachers are carefully avoiding the sp 
cialized instruction for giving a rural bias to their training. If that offer i: 
not availed of in the future, I will not say that I will withdraw it, but I musi 
modify it. It shows how difficult it is for a teacher to devote part of his tim: 
to purely rural training. Perhaps it is rather due to a mistaken idea on thy 
part of many teachers to go as soon as possible into the towns.

   EDUCATIONAL MOVEMENTS IN GREAT BRITAIN. 531 
Several members of the House continued the discussion of this 
problem. Mr. William Anson, member for Oxford University, called 
attention to the fact that, whereas formerly graduates of the training 
colleges were appointed as soon as they left the college, in 1909 out 
of a total of 4,836 who graduated in July 1,500 were still out of 
employment in October. But in spite of this excessive supply over 
demand, training colleges are being built very rapidly. The board, 
by a contribution of 75 per cent of the cost, assists local authorities 
to build new colleges, and £100,000 is allocated this year in aid of such 
colleges. 
With regard to the narrow view of professional training thus en- 
couraged, Mr. Anson said: 
Local authorities are justly proud of their own educational appliances, and 
now what happens? The local education authority first of all sends its chil- 
dren who are going into the teaching profession from their elementary school 
to their own secondary school, where they are prepared for that profession. 
They are sent from the local authority’s secondary school to the local au- 
thority’s training college, and then the local authority to teacherships within 
its area is disposed to give the preference to the teachers from its own training 
colleges. Therefore, the teacher moves in this narrow circle—from the ele- 
mentary school to the secondary school, and from the secondary school to the 
training colleges, from the training college back to the elementary school, 
possibly within the compass of one urban area. One can not think that that 
gives to the teacher that variety of experience and breadth of view which 
we desire to teach in our elementary school to possess. 
Having reference to the serious agitation excited in London over 
the conditions of unemployed graduates, Mr. Anson explained that 
the London education authorities are very desirous of drawing their 
teachers from all quarters and have announced that they will not 
take more than a certain number of teachers from out of their own 
training colleges. Consequently, many of their graduates will get 
no employment in London, and unfortunately they are looked upon 
askance if they try to get employment elsewhere. 
Mr. Anson was followed by Sir James Yoxall, formerly secretary 
of the National Union of Teachers, who strongly opposed the notion 
that there are too many training colleges. The crux of the problem, 
in his opinion, did not lie in that direction. On this point he said: 
I am not in favor, and the teachers with whom I am associated and for 
whom I speak are not in favor, of checking the number of training college 
laces. They are anxious, and have been all along, that certain modifications 
should be made in the training college system, but to pursue the policy of 
ultiplying college places while at the same time increasing the number of 
eachers who have never been to training colleges at all is surely madness, 
nd that is the policy of the board of education. 
The remedy is not to narrow the number of places in training colleges or 
0 attack critics who put their finger upon this weak spot. The remedy lies 
in the Board of Education, as early as may be, and as gradually as is fair  
-P-A-G-E-552

       and proper and practicable, preventing the entrance into the profession, as cer- 
tificated teachers, of young men and young women who have not been to a train- 
ing college. If the board of education had, in times past, when they were insti- 
tuting these training college places, similarly. narrowed what is called the 
acting teachers’ list and adjusted more carefully the demand. and the supply, 
this difficulty would never have arisen. 
The present provision of training colleges classified by their con- 
trolling authorities, as shown in Table 7, serves to emphasize the 
main contention in the foregoing discussion.

THE UNEMPLOYED GRADUATES. 
The public excitement with respect to the unemployed graduates 
from teachers’ colleges was increased by the publication during the 
year of a circular on the subject bearing the title “ The tragedy of 
the unemployed.” According to this circular there were at the time 
“thousands of young men and women who, after being trained for 
7 years at a cost to the State of some £300, are unable to find em- 
ployment in their own profession, and are without any prospect of 
doing so.” In proof of this statement the following facts were 
presented in graphic form:

From the above statistics it was inferred that half the children 
in the schools were “taught by unqualified and often incompetent 
teachers; and that “at least 15,000 teachers have no other quali- 
fications than that they are over 18 years of age and ‘have been| 
vaccinated.” 
This condition was attributed to the parsimony of county council 
and the maintenance of excessively large classes. The circular sta

that “in the metropolis of London alone there are 2,000 classes of 
more than 60 children, and a similar state of things obtains in the 
provinces. Everybody who knows anything about schools knows 
that the ablest teacher in the world with a class of more than 60 
can not possibly educate them.” 
MEASURES FOR RAISING THE STANDARD OF THE TEACHING FORCE. 
Among measures recently adopted by the Board of Education for 
the improvement of elementary schools special importance attaches, 
at this time, to those directed to the improvement of the teaching 
force. These measures relate to the preliminary education of intend- 
ing teachers and to the official requirements as to staff for schools 
participating in the Government grant. With regard to the former 
matter, the action of the board is chiefly advisory, local authorities 
being, in this case, the determining factor; but as regards the staff, 
the regulations of the board are decisive. 
The latest regulations on the subject, which were issued in 1909, 
were directed against the two evils of large classes and untrained 
teachers. The standard adopted and its advance over that which 
it replaces are indicated by the following schedule showing the classi- 
fication of teachers and the number of pupils allowed by the regula- 
tions for one teacher of each class. The first column gives the scale 
that was in effect at the time the latest regulations were issued and

CONFLICT OF AUTHORITIES IN THE MATTER OF THE INSPECTORATE. 
At every step in the progress of the national system the interaction 
of the central and local authorities is evident; the influence of the 
education associations, though less immediate, is even greater. The 
present year has furnished a striking illustration of checks and 
counterchecks growing out of this relation in the case of a confiden- 
tial circular pertaining to the inspection service which was sent out 
by an officer of the board of education. 
For an understanding of the matter it should be explained that 
the Government maintains a corps of inspectors responsible to the 
board of education who annually visit and report upon the indi- 
vidual schools in respect to the particulars covered by the grant 
regulations. Local authorities also employ school inspectors who 
have no relation to the central board. The circular in question was 
in the form of a memorandum entitled “ The status and duties of 
It set forth 
certain opinions concerning the local inspectors, based upon the 
results of previous inquiries touching their antecedents, social, pro- 
fessional, and academic, the nature of their duties, and the value of 
their services, and in plain terms discredited the work of ex-elemen- 
tary teachers who had been advanced to these posts. 
quiry in the House of Commons it developed that the circular had 
been drawn up by the Chief Inspector of Schools in pursuance of 
the general policy which left trusted officers of the board free to inspectors employed by local education authorities.” 
From an in- 
secure the knowledge required in the discharge of their functions by
-P-A-G-E-555
  EDUCATIONAL MOVEMENTS IN GREAT BRITAIN. 535 
such means as they might deem advisable. In the course of the dis- 
cussion the fact was brought out that the circular had been marked 
confidential by its author, from whom it had passed to the secretary 
of the board. It had the sign of this officer’s approval and was dis- 
tributed to the entire force of the board’s inspectors. It was, how- 
ever, distinctly stated in the House that the circular had not been 
signed by the president of the board and did not express the senti- 
ments or purposes that controlled its official actions. 
The tenor of the memorandum may be inferred from passages 
cited in the House of Commons. After reference to the inquiries 
that had been sent out and to the number of ex-elementary teachers 
serving as local inspectors, the circular states that of the entire 
number— 
not more than two or three have had the antecedents which were usually 
looked for in candidates for junior inspectorships, namely, that they had been 
educated first at a public school and then at Oxford or Cambridge. 
The difference in respect to efficiency between ex-elementary teacher in- 
spectors and those who have had a more liberal education is very great. Very 
few of our inspectors have a good word to say for local inspectors of the former 
type, whereas those of the latter type are, with three exceptions, well spoken of. 
* * * * * * * 
Apart from the fact that elementary teachers are as a rule uncultured and 
imperfectly educated, and though many, if not most, of them are creatures of 
tradition and routine, there are special reasons why the bulk of the local 
inspectors in this country should be unequal to the discharge of their responsi- 
ble duties. It is in the large towns which had school boards before the ap- 
pointed day that the majority of local inspectors are to be found. 
* * * * * * * 
In these towns the local authorities have inherited from the school board 
not merely a vicious system of local inspection, but also a large number of 
vicious local inspectors. 
* * * * * * * 
As compared with the ex-elementary teacher usually engaged in the hopeless 
task of surveying or trying to survey a wide field of action from a well-worn 
groove, the inspector of public schools of the ’varsity type has the advantage 
of being able to look at elementary education from a point of view of complete 
detachment, and therefore of being able to handle its problems with freshness 
and originality. 
The general interpretation put upon this document was voiced by 
Sir Philip Magnus in the course of the discussion in the House. 
After pointing out the impossibility of distinguishing between a 
circular signed by the chief officer of the board of education and one 
which expresses the deliberate opinion of the board itself, Mr. Mag- 
nus said: 
What happens when a Jocal authority is thinking of appointing a local 
inspector? The local authority is very often advised by His Majesty’s inspector, 
who frequently visits the schools. They would ask his opinion as to the various 
qualifications of the persons from amongst whom they wished to make the 
   
-P-A-G-E-556
  536 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
appointment. The district inspector, under the board of education, would have 
received from the chief inspector under the board a letter not asking only 
questions, but distinctly stating that all other persons except Oxford and 
Cambridge graduates are unfit to act as local inspectors under the local au- 
thority. Therefore, it can not be said for one moment that the president of 
the board, through his officer, was not interfering in the appointment of those 
local inspectors by local committees. That is really a very serious matter. 
* * * * * * * 
Surely it is not only the elementary teachers who have been affected by this 
expression of opinion on the part of the chief inspector, but it affects all the 
local universities throughout the Kingdom. We are told that only Oxford and 
Cambridge graduates are fitted to be appointed to these positions of inspectors. 
Representing another university, I should be very much surprised if graduates 
of London University, some of whom have been expressly trained for the 
function of inspectors and teachers in these schools, were not considered 
competent to act as local inspectors or chief inspectors. London University 
has a training college of its own absolutely incorporated with the university. 
Surely the students of such a training college can be regarded as competent to 
act as inspectors if they attain a sufficiently high degree. But the opinion of 
the chief inspector is that none but graduates of Oxford and Cambridge are 
competent. Of course I have the greatest possible appreciation for the course 
of study pursued in those older universities, but at the same time I do think 
it right to say a word not only for the University of London, but also for the 
provincial universities and for the universities of Scotland and Ireland. 
The excitement caused by the circular was greatly due to the 
conviction that it was part of a determined purpose to “crush down 
elementary education; to lop off all its natural growths and exten- 
sions.” This view was strongly expressed by Sir James Yoxall, 
the representative of the elementary teachers in Parliament. After 
rehearsing the course of events which gave color to this view of the 
document, he said: 
In fact, at every possible stage and turn the policy of the chief permanent 
officials of the board, other than those of the elementary school branch of it, 
has been inimical to a popular and democratic spirit in education. 
Intense opposition to this action on the part of the board was 
manifested by local authorities and by associations of teachers 
throughout the country. 
The National Union of Teachers, one of the largest associations in 
the world, having a membership of 69,000, on the second day of its 
annual meeting suspended the standing orders to give place to a 
discussion of the circular. The conference joined in the universal 
condemnation of the circular, which was declared to be part “of a 
whole administrative system intended to discredit schools, scholars, 
teachers, and inspectors not belonging to a certain social class.” 
Satisfaction was expressed that Mr. Runciman had repudiated and 
withdrawn the circular, but nevertheless a resolution was adopted 
calling for a parliamentary inquiry into the board’s administration. 
Subsequently a demonstration was held under the auspices of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-557
  
  
EDUCATIONAL MOVEMENTS IN GREAT BRITAIN. 537 
National Union at Royal Albert Hall, London, to protest against “ the 
slander on the teaching profession contained in the circular.” At 
this demonstration passages were read from the circular more ob- 
jectionable than those presented before the House of Commons, and 
amid intense excitement it was resolved that an appeal should be made 
to the prime minister “to appoint a select committee to inquire into 
the whole question of appointment and promotion in the inspectorate 
of the board of education and other branches of the civil service; 
that a copy of this resolution be sent to the prime minister, the 
leader of the opposition, the chairman of the Labor Party, the presi- 
dent of the board of education, and other members of Parliament.” 
The prime minister on his part waived an immediate hearing on 
the matter, but requested that the desires of the association should be 
submitted in writing. Meanwhile the event has given vigorous 
impulse to the demand for a teachers’ professional council, advisory 
to the central board, and an official register of teachers as a means 
of discriminating between the qualified and the incompetent. 
The London Journal of Education, in a dispassionate review of the 
matter, notes that both parties to the contest appear to have fallen 
into extremes with regard to qualifications that should weigh most 
in the choice of school inspectors. The Journal strikes the essentials 
of the service in a question,:“Is it not possible, we ask, to combine 
the two desiderata, experience and culture?” As to the means of 
securing this result, the Journal continues: “ If the president would 
announce in future no one shall be appointed to a primary inspector- 
ate who has not taken an honor degree’ (not necessarily at Oxford or 
Cambridge) and had besides at least one year’s experience of teach- 
ing in an elementary school, there would before long be no lack of 
candidates thus doubly qualified.” 
The question of values thus raised is pertinent to the service of 
school supervision under any and all of its varied forms. 
     
     
        
   
      
   
                  
   
   
    
        
     SCHOOL-ATTENDANCE BILL. 
The most important educational measure submitted to Parliament 
the present year is a bill for prolonging the period of school attend- 
lance. This bill is the culmination of efforts persistently renewed for 
he last two decades and urged upon the board of education the pres- 
nt year with irresistible force by a delegation from the Association 
£ Education Committees, representing 177 local authorities in the 
ountry and one-third the entire population. 
This association reaffirms its opinion that no child under 14 years of age 
should be exempt either partially or wholly from school attendance, and that 
the Government be urged to raise the age for half time, or partial exemption, 
‘rom 12 to 13 now, with provision for a further increase to 14 after 2 years.
-P-A-G-E-558
    538 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
In support of the resolution the president of the committee de- 
nounced the legal provision for half-time attendance, which he de- 
clared was “ bad educationally, physically, and morally.” 
As showing the wide consensus of opinion as to the need of pro- 
longing the period of compulsory attendance, the president called 
attention to the following facts: 
    
         
                                                
    
       
   
     
     An inter-departmental committee, the trade unions, the poor-law commis- 
sion, and nearly every education. authority in the Kingdom had pronounced in 
favor of some step being taken immediately to raise the age at which children 
should leave school, either partially or wholly, and the last resolution passed 
by the Association of Education Committees was that the age should be raised 
from 12 to 13 now, with provision for a further increase to 14 after 2 years. 
The pronounced opinion of their association was that the proper age for chil- 
dren to leave school was 16, but they felt that this, at present, was not within 
the realms of practical politics, and they must be satisfied with less. Certainly, 
however, the time had now come when, without any friction, the age could be 
raised to 13, with the promise that in 12 months or 2 years it should be raised 
to 14. It was true that when, about four years ago, a poll was taken in the 
textile manufactures, there was a majority against raising the age, but those 
who lived in the district and knew how that majority was obtained would agree 
with him that it was not a real test. The majority came from the workers 
in the card rooms, who were mostly young girls in their teens and were nearly 
all unmarried, and these, for some reason best known to themselves, voted 
against raising the age at all. Possibly as they had come to the mills themselves 
under the existing conditions, they did not see why their brothers and sisters 
should not do the same. There was also another fact which put a different 
complexion on the poll. It was very generally supposed that the half-timers 
were employed by the manufacturers or by the boards of directors of the mill 
companies, but there was a class of men employed in the mills who dealt with 
these half-timers and made a living out of them, and therefore they could not 
expect such men to vote in any other way than to maintain the existing state 
of things, because it was so much to their advantage. He believed that if a 
poll was taken again to-morrow, even including the elements he had mentioned, 
the result would be very different. He did not know anything on which there 
had been such a strong reversion of opinion during the last few years as on 
education, and on all hands they found that men who four years ago were 
willing to see something against raising the age of half-timers were now of 
the opinion that it would be beneficial to them and their children.* 
In response, Mr. Runciman assured the delegation that the depart- 
ment was at work on a measure for dealing with the attendance of 
half-timers, which would be introduced shortly into the House o 
Commons. 
This assurance was realized by the education (school and continua 
tion class attendance) bill, which was presented to the House earl 
in June. The bill comprises four main points, namely: First, th 
abolition of the yet lingering remnants of the half-time system 
second, the permissive adoption by a local authority of compulso: 
continuative education up to the age of 16 for boys and girls wh

have left the day school; third, the raising of the minimum age 
of exemption from compulsory school attendance to the age of 13 
where compulsory continuative education is locally adopted; and, 
fourth, the locally permissive adoption of day-school attendance 
by-laws, extending to age 15. If this measure is enacted all day- 
school attendance will be full-time attendance, and from age 13 to 
14 (or 15 at local option) exemption may be granted on condition 
of attendance at continuation classes. 
The need of the proposed legislation with respect to school attend- 
ance is further indicated by the following statistics showing the 
number of pupils by age groups in the total enrollment for 1908-9:

NORMAL PROGRESS IN SCOTLAND. 
In Scotland there is little to record from year to year in regard to 
the essential conditions of a school system, save normal progress, 
which is illustrated by the steady increase in the enrollment in the 
schools as shown in the following table:

The number of adult teachers employed in the schools in 1910 was 
18,024, of whom 12,200 were trained and certificated. The current 
expenditure for the schools amounted to £3,713,629 ($18,048,237), 
being at the rate of £4 19s. 11d. ($24.15) per capita of average 
attendance.

    The expenditure for the schools supported by the elected school 
boards, which enrolled 87 per cent of all the pupils, was £2,167,401 
($10,533,569), of which amount the Government grant furnished 48} 
per cent and local taxes 444 per cent, leaving a small balance from 
other sources. The denominational schools, which are found chiefly 
in the large cities, derive 75 per cent of their support from the 
treasury grant. 
The system of public education (in Scotland) was not materially 
changed by the act of 1908, but its scope was greatly extended, and 
Scotland is now offering important lessons in provision for the phys- 
ical and social well-being of school children through the agency of 
public schools. 
HIGHER GRADE SCHOOLS. 
In both divisions of Great Britain particular efforts are being 
made at the present time to develop what are termed in England 
higher elementary schools and in Scotland higher grade or inter- 
mediate schools. This effort illustrates in a striking manner the 
difference in the prevailing conception of popular education in the 
two divisions. In England the schools of this grade form an in- 
tegral part of the elementary system, and their programs are simply an 
extension of those of the elementary grades, arranged in a three-years’ 
course, and providing for vocational training according to local con- 
ditions; qualified pupils are admitted to the higher elementary 
schools at 12 years of age. The local educational authorities estab- 
lish the schools and must provide equipment and staff as required 
by the official regulations. 
In many cases, especially in the larger municipalities, there is 
much friction between the central and local authorities in regard to 
these schools, and the London county council has recently withdrawn 
its 22 schools of this class from the extra grant list in order to de- 
velop them freely, according to their fuller understanding of the 
needs of the city. On the other hand, the supervision and aid ex- 
tended by the Government is welcome and necessary in smaller towns 
and in districts in which it is difficult to maintain schools of this 
special character, from the lack both of means and of strong public 
support. The special place which these schools are intended to fill 
in the English system is clearly indicated by the efforts for drawing 
off the more promising pupils of the elementary schools into secondary 
schools. The scope of the higher elementary schools as compared 
with the elementary grades and with secondary schools is illustrated 
by the appended programs. 
The higher elementary schools on the grant list numbered 51 in 
1910, with an enrollment of 10,765 pupils; of these, 9,377 were above
-P-A-G-E-561
  
EDUCATIONAL MOVEMENTS IN GREAT BRITAIN. 541 
12 years of age. So far little progress has been made in developing 
the schools on the vocational side. 
In Scotland the higher grade schools are closely articulated with 
the elementary schools below them and with the secondary schools 
and all three are treated as integral parts of a unified system. Hence 
in Scotland, the higher grade schools correspond very closely to 
the manual training high schools of our own country. The educa- 
tion of the children is carried forward on broad lines; English, 
mathematics, modern languages, science, and drawing forming part 
of the curriculum. The goal of this course of study is the inter- 
mediate certificate, which is proof that the pupil has had at least 
three years’ instruction beyond the elementary stage. In many in- 
stances a desire for further advancement is created by this success 
and pupils continue to the close of the full secondary course of study. 
The rapid increase in the higher grade schools of Scotland is indi- 
cated by the following statistics:

  Notwithstanding the different purposes toward which this class 
of intermediate schools in England and Scotland is directed, forces 
quite apart from the official authorities are at work which tend to 
assimilate them to a common type. On account of their relation to 
the industrial problem as it affects the majority of school children, 
these schools represent the most interesting field of experiment in 
the system of which they are a part. 
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN SECONDARY EDUCATION IN ENGLAND. 
By the Education Act of 1902 the province of the local education 
authorities in England and Wales was extended far beyond the 
limits set by the act of 1870. In the terms of the Education Act, 
“The local education authority shall consider the educational needs 
of their area and take such steps as seem to them desirable, after 
consultation with the board of education, to supply or aid the supply 
of education other than elementary and to promote the general coor- 
dination of all forms of education.” [Part II, Clause 2 (1).] 
   
-P-A-G-E-562
    542 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
The term “higher education,” as thus used, applies to a variety of 
agencies, including secondary schools, technical institutions, schools 
of art, and teachers’ training colleges. There is, as yet, little co- 
herence between the different orders of schools thus brought within 
the same administrative province, but every year new bonds of 
unity and continuity are formed between them. 
The functions of the board of education are substantially the same 
for all the various classes of schools comprised under the general 
head of “higher education.” They are exercised by means of official 
regulations determining the conditions on which grants will be 
allowed for such schools, and by a service of inspection and exami- 
nation. 
In the case of secondary schools the board’s requirements have had 
the effect of raising the average standard of the schools, systema- 
tizing their courses of instruction, and improving the quality and 
methods of teaching. As a consequence, the teachers claim and se- 
cure better salaries. The fear that official regulations would be 
prejudicial to the free initiative and flexible programs which have 
given force and varied adaptations to the secondary schools of Eng- 
land in the past has been allayed by the increased elasticity of the 
board’s requirements and by special encouragement given to educa- 
tional experiments conducted in individual schools under favorable 
circumstances. The local authorities, on their part, have entered 
earnestly upon the work of extending and equalizing the provision 
for secondary education, and several of the chief boroughs and the 
larger counties have sought expert guidance in respect to plans for 
the improvement of existing schools and the establishment of new 
schools. Through this double stimulus the number of secondary 
schools under some degree of public control is rapidly increasing. 
In 1905 there were 122 secondary schools in England provided by 
the local authorities; in 1910 out of a ‘total of 841 secondary schools 
on the grant list 325 were provided. This number included schools 
originally established by the local authorities and former endowed 
and proprietary (stock company) schools which have been trans- 
ferred to the authorities. The remaining schools on the list (num- 
bering 516) have popular representatives upon their governing 
bodies. In addition to the secondary schools on the grant list there 
were 87 secondary schools not receiving public aid but recognized as 
_ efficient, making, with 109 schools in Wales, a total of 1,037 second- 
ary schools under Government inspection. They registered 172,244 
pupils (boys, 92,743; girls, 79,501). Of this total more than one- 
fourth were on a free basis. 
As a condition of receiving grant aid, the board of education re- 
quires that a secondary school not managed by the local education 
 
-P-A-G-E-563
    EDUCATIONAL MOVEMENTS IN GREAT BRITAIN. 543 
authority shall have on its governing board a majority of members 
representing a popular constituency, and further that a certain 
number of free places, ordinarily 25 per cent of the total accommo- 
dation, shall be reserved for pupils selected for transfer from the 
public elementary schools. Through these conditions private con- 
trol and social exclusiveness are broken up in the secondary schools 
which have the benefit of public funds, and they are brought within 
the reach of young people who formerly had access only to public 
elementary schools. 
The effort to preserve the traditional character of secondary edu- 
cation in England, and at the same time to meet the very insistent 
demand for its wider diffusion and closer adaptations to modern 
conditions, is shown by the conditions pertaining to the transfer of 
pupils from elementary to secondary schools. In this connection 
the official regulations explain that: 
An important though subsidiary object of the elementary schools is to 
discover individual children who show promise of exceptional capacity and to 
develop their special gifts (so far as this can be done without sacrificing the 
interests of the majority of the children), so that they may be qualified to 
pass at the proper age into secondary schools, and be able to derive the maxi- 
mum of benefit from the education there offered. 
The transfer of pupils from elementary to secondary schools must 
take place not later than the twelfth year of age; but an earlier age 
is encouraged by a grant paid on transferred pupils between the 
ages of 10 and 12 years equivalent to the grant allowed for pupils 
in the public elementary schools. The main grant in secondary 
schools is paid in respect of pupils between the ages of 12 and 18 
years. 
The secondary schools are also being utilized for the academic 
training of young persons intending to become elementary teachers. 
They are carefully selected and are aided in their effort by a system 
of scholarships arranged between the board of education and local 
authorities. 
The distinction between elementary and secondary education is 
illustrated by the courses of study for the two classes of schools, 
comprised in the appended prospectuses. 
It should be explained that the secondary schools affected by these 
recent measures are for the most part intended for pupils whose 
school life ends at about 16 years of age. The higher order of sec- 
ondary schools, which carry the education of their students up to 
the age of 18 years, maintain close relations with the older univer- 
sities and offer with the latter a continuous and elaborate scheme 
of liberal education.

ordinary routine of lessons, or (2) be given systematically and as a course of graduate instruction. 
3 A course of instruction in combined domestic subjects must include cookery, laundry work, and house- 
wifery. In each of these subjects at least half the time must be given to practical work by the scholars 
with their own hands. The number of scholars registered in a class must not exceed 18, and they must be

The private preparatory schools, whose work is illustrated by the 
last two of the above programs, prepare pupils for the entrance 
examinations to the endowed secondary schools, including the great 
“ public schools.” The age for admission to these schools and col- 
leges, as some are termed, ranges from 12 to 14. Secondary schools 
of this type are generally organized in a classical and a modern side, 
both courses of study being regulated by the requirements for en- 
trance at Oxford or Cambridge. The principal schools of this 
class include also an army section in which boys are prepared for 
Woolwich and Sandhurst. 
As ew rule, it is not expected that pupils from the public elementary 
schools will enter this higher order of secondary schools, although 
there is no impassable gulf between the elementary schools and the 
modern side of the schools here considered. 
The standards and general scholastic purposes of this class of 
institutions may be inferred, (1) from their common entrance re- 
quirements; (2) from the daily programs given on pages following.

CHELTENHAM COLLEGE." 
The school contains a senior and junior department. The studies of the 
junior department are so arranged that it may serve as a preparation for the 
senior department. The’ senior department is divided into three sides, classical, 
military and civil, and the modern side. The boys of the modern side start 
by taking all the subjects of the classical side, except that they substitute 
German and extra French for Greek. As they rise in the school the number 
of their Latin lessons is gradually reduced in favor of more mathematics, 
science, etc., until, in the upper fifth and sixth forms, they are able to specialize 
in modern languages, mathematics, science, or engineering.

DULWICH COLLEGE." 
Organization—The college is divided into the senior and junior 
sections, and as a boy rises to a higher place in the senior sevtion, he 
has an increasing opportunity-of devoting his time to special subjects. 
The senior school is divided into four sides: Classical, modern, 
science, and engineering. 
Boys on the classical side follow the ordinary classical routine, 
which is intended mainly as a preparation for professional life and 
for the universities. 
Boys on the modern side are taught chiefly mathematics, modern 
languages, and science. Arrangements are also made on this side 
for teaching Latin to those who contemplate standing for exami- 
nations in which it is required. 
There are special classes for boys preparing for the army exami- 
nations. 
The science side prepares boys for the universities, for the prelim- 
inary medical examinations, and for examinations where pure science 
is the main subject. Boys enter for the London University matricu- 
lation examination from any part of the school. 
The engineering side gives boys who are destined to become engi- 
neers instruction in the rudiments of their future profession, and 
prepares them for the engineer’s office or workshop. 
The college has been recognized by the Royal College of Physicians 
and the Royal College of Surgeons as an institution from which boys 
may enter for the first conjoint board examination in chemistry, 
physics, and elementary biology. This examination must be passed 
by everyone who enters the medical profession. This recognition has 
been obtained with a view of making it possible for a boy entering 
the medical profession to remain at school until he has passed this 
examination in the above subjects, which seems advisable for many 
reasons. It is possible for a boy, if he is sufficiently proficient, to take 
at the same time the preliminary scientific examination at the London 
University. A boy who has passed the first conjoint board exami- 
nation at school obtains a certain remission of fees at the hospitals, 
and is able to devote the whole of his time at the hospitals to purely 
professional studies. 
Regulations as to age-—A boy is not allowed to remain in the col- 
lege after the end of the term in which he completes his nineteenth 
year, or to remain in the junior section after the end of the term in 
which he completes his sixteenth year, without special permission.

DEVELOPMENTS IN SECONDARY EDUCATION IN SCOTLAND. 
The changes taking place in the secondary schools of Scotland are 
similar to those in the high schools of our own country. Special 
efforts are made by the Scotch Education Department to encourage 
the teaching of modern languages and the provision of equipment 
for practical instruction in science, with the result that modern sides 
are rapidly developing in the secondary schools. 
According to the official report for 1909-10 the supply of centers 
of secondary education is now about complete for the country. These 
centers, the report says— 
have not been selected in any arbitrary manner according to a prearranged 
scheme for covering the country as a whole. They represent a natural out- 
growth, and yet they are, as a matter of fact, well distributed, and do bring the 
opportunity of secondary education within reach of practically every capable 
child in Scotland. That this should have been achieved without artificial stim- 
ulation is a most satisfactory feature. 
It is not, of course, the case that every child has a center of higher education 
within convenient walking distance of his home. ‘ Such an ideal is impossible 
of realization in a country containing so extensive a series of thinly populated 
districts as Scotland does. But the establishment and maintenance of a sufli- 
cient number of well-equipped and well-staffed centers placed in suitable situ- 
ations has had as its complement and corollary the institution of a bursary 
system on a scale ample enough to render it certain that, where transference 
is inevitable, a lack of means will not be an obstacle. The Act of 1908 empow- 
ered the secondary education committees to make payment out of the district 
funds of such sums as they deemed necessary to enable properly qualified pupils 
to proceed from primary to intermediate or secondary schools. And the com- 
mittees have not been slow to avail themselves of the opportunity. The esti- 
mated expenditure upon bursaries by the secondary education committees from 
the district fund alone has been, during the financial year just ended, £84,800. 
If to this be added an approximate expenditure upon bursaries of £65,000 from 
separate endowment funds administered by the committees or by the governors 
of the endowments a total of £149,800 is reached. 
In the most sparsely populated parts of the country the transporta- 
tion of pupils at public expense is the only alternative to providing 
at great cost an increased number of secondary centers; in districts 
which are not easily accessible to an organized intermediate or a sec- 
ondary school preparation is offered in the elementary schools by 
which apt pupils are enabled to enter the second or even the third 
year of the center school.

  EDUCATIONAL MOVEMENTS IN GREAT BRITAIN. 551 
The increasing complexity of the problems of secondary education, 
with the consequent necessity of readjustments, was emphasized 
during the year by a congress on secondary education called at Glas- 
gow University May 13, 1911. 
The relation between secondary schools and universities, which has 
always been closely maintained in Scotland, was a prominent subject 
of discussion, and the promotion of even closer relations was advo- 
cated. The conditions bearing upon this particular point were briefly 
rehearsed by Mr. Fyfe, chairman of the congress, whose presentation 
of this subject was reported as follows: 
For nearly 20 years—that is to say, since the foundation of the leaving certifi- 
cate and the establishment of the preliminary examinations—secondary has been 
marked off from university education, to the great benefit of both. Indeed, 
there is perhaps no more marked feature in the history of Scottish education 
during these years than the enormous advance that has been made in secondary 
education, not only with regard to its standard and quality, but also to the 
number participating in it. 
But while it is generally admitted that the two agencies to which I have just 
referred have done great things in the past to standardize and elevate secondary 
school education and to delimit the scope of its operation, the question is now 
being asked. whether the preliminary examination, in its present form, and 
particularly in relation to secondary schools, should not be revised. Under the 
benevolent despotism of the education department, well-balanced courses of 
related studies have been, or are being, substituted for detached and isolated 
subjects taken in an unconnected and haphazard way. The modern tendency 
in school education is to look to general fitness rather than to special knowledge 
in particular subjects. Therefore, it is the opinion of many, that the link 
between the university and the secondary schools would be greatly strengthened 
if the university were prepared to accept the new school leaving certificate, 
based, as it presumably will be, on the satisfactory completion of a broad and 
generous course of secondary education, tested and appraised on the general 
lines of the abiturienten examen of the German universitiés as a guaranty of 
general fitness to begin any of the higher studies which the university provides. 
The idea thus advanced met with approval in the congress, and it 
was eventually embodied in a motion submitted by Dr. John C. Kerr, 
vice president of the secondary association. The motion was as 
follows: 
That the congress, while recognizing the advances which have been made in 
secondary education in Scotland, affirms its conviction that the realization of 
the ideals of the primary schools on the one hand, and of the universities and 
central institutions on the other, is dependent on a generous conception of the 
treatment to be accorded to the secondary schools in respect of maintenance, 
organization, and control. 
In support of the motion Mr. Kerr, a high authority on educa- 
tional conditions in Scotland, called attention to the effects of recent 
movements upon secondary schools. Among these he noted, in par- 
ticular, the important fact that the secondary schools are now pro- 
viding primary teachers, and therefore the character and aspirations 
   
-P-A-G-E-572
  
  552 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
of these schools have a vital influence on the education of the people 
as a whole. The secondary school, however, he declared, had more 
to do than the training of future teachers, nor was its main purpose 
to eliminate and select and prepare for university work. “It has to 
give an environment in which our youth may ‘find themselves’ and 
be helped to discern how their highest possibilities may be realized.” 
This involves “a liberal conception of the curriculum and of the 
methods of classification.” A liberal treatment of maintenance was 
needed, Mr. Kerr maintained, “if for no other reason than that 
ability could not be obtained without good salaries. The liberal con- 
ception of control which appealed to them involved freedom to work 
within the law.” He acknowledged “the lofty ideals of the central 
authority and the able, earnest, self-denying work of the local authori- 
ties,” but in his opinion there was “a risk that the intricate machinery 
which had been evolved for educational reforms was becoming dan- 
gerously dominating.” He emphasized the point by quoting the 
words of the late Prof. James, “ When a living want of mankind has 
got itself officially protected and organized in an institution, one of 
the things which the institution most surely tends to do is to stand 
in the way of the natural gratification of the want itself.” 
The efforts for promoting a liberal conception of secondary educa- 
tion have culminated in a proposition, now before the education de- 
partment, for replacing the single scheme of examination for the 
leaving certificate, which marks the completion of a full secondary 
course, by schemes for several orders of leaving certificates. ~The 
following courses have received the indorsement of many of the lead- 
ing schoolmasters of Scotland, and with some modifications would, 
it is believed, be approved by the university councils.

With respect. to this typical scheme Principal A. P. Laurie, of the 
Heriott-Watt College, Edinburgh, says: 
Perhaps the most interesting fact to notice about these groups is that it is 
possible, in more than one of them, to leave out the study of Latin altogether. 
The proposal is therefore definitely made that a boy should be able to enter 
the university not only for a medical, scientific, or technical course, without 
Latin, but also that he should be able to enter upon his course for the degree 
of M. A., without Latin. * * * It is worth noting the reasons that are 
given why these head masters have come to this decision. They point out that 
under the present regulations of the university it is possible for a student to 
take the M. A. degree without including among his subjects the study of Latin, 
and consequently that the only demand made upon him is that he should pass 
an examination in Latin at the university preliminary examination of a stand- 
ard no higher than the pass in Latin required by the Scotch Education Depart- 
ment for the intermediate certificate. That is to say, that the university on 
the one hand requires from the student for the M. A. degree an amount of 
Latin that can be easily learned by a boy who ceases to study the subject after 
the age of 15, and that it requires no more. Under these circumstances, these 
head masters think it would be far better to make Latin optional. It is 
unlikely that the universities will accept this suggestion, but it is significant 
of the general tendencies underlying secondary education in Scotland that such 
a proposal should be made by those in responsible positions.     
                                    
     
            
   The survey of current educational events in Great Britain shows 
a movement of transformation and expansion extending over both 
divisions of the Kingdom. In England the movement is disturbed 
by conflicts of opinion which are suppressed for the moment by the 
general belief that a resettlement of essentials simply awaits the 
results of the recent crisis in Parliament. The enlarging conception 
of education as a factor in industrial efficiency and a bond of union 
between peoples is even more marked in England than in Scotland, 
partly perhaps because it is a doctrine to which England has been 
lately converted. It was signally emphasized by the Imperial Edu- 
cation Conference.

education in the island Kingdom. Oxford and Cambridge and the 
universities of Scotland, separated in their origin by many centuries 
from the later universities, have borne an important part in modern 
progress and have in turn been modified or invigorated by modern 
influences. Durham University, founded in 1832, was the pioneer 
in the movement for providing the north of England with university 
facilities, and, although the original Durham College followed closely 
the curricula of the older universities, the claims of the technical pro- 
fessions were recognized by temporary provision as early as 1837. 
By the incorporation of the Medical College of Newcastle, in 1852, 
and the North of England Institute of Mining and Mechanical Engi- 
neering, in 1874, this university was brought into the sweep of the 
modern movement. 
The University of London was created as an examining body in 
1837 as a protest against the religious restriction which prevailed at 
Oxford and Cambridge until 1854. The new university stood, there- 
fore, from its beginning for the full meaning of the modern move- 
ment—expanded curriculum and universal opportunity.

EDUCATIONAL MOVEMENTS. IN GREAT BRITAIN. 555 
DEVELOPMENTS AT OXFORD AND CAMBRIDGE. 
The popular demands for education which in England marked the 
latter half of the nineteenth century were felt in the older universi- 
ties. In response to this impulse extension lectures were started 
by Cambridge in 1872, followed in 1877 by similar action on the part 
of Oxford. The scheme of examinations for secondary schools and 
scholars, the encouragement given by the two universities to the 
higher education of women, and the provision made by them for 
noncollegiate resident students bore witness to the strength of the 
popular movement. New scholastic aims were also encouraged by 
the institution of diplomas for the promotion of research in special 
subjects, of which recent examples are diplomas in forestry, public 
health, education, and economics. Before the nineteenth century 
closed) all these activities were in full operation, and as the social and 
scientific interests to which they pertain have assumed more and more 
definite character and purpose they have, in turn, reenforced the 
modern departures in the older centers of learning. This reflex 
influence is plainly seen in the scheme for the reform of Oxford pro- 
posed in 1909 by the chancellor, Lord Curzon. Apart from the 
internal affairs of the university itself the proposals bear upon three 
subjects of more general importance; the first of these subjects 
relates to the extension work of the university. The time is oppor- 
tune for giving more definite organization to this service on account 
of the changed attitude of the working classes toward the university; 
more and more they are looking to it for economic and civic instruc- 
tion. This is plainly indicated by the relation with the Workers’ 
Educational Association which was formed at Oxford in 1903. 
Through the efforts of this association above 1,300 organizations 
desirous of promoting the education of the working classes have been 
federated and their independent efforts coordinated to some degree. 
The greatest achievement of the association so far is the establishment 
under Oxford’s lead of what are known as tutorial classes. Beginning 
with 8 Oxford classes in 1908, the number was increased to 12 in 1909, 
and only lack of funds has prevented further increase. Cambridge, 
(London, and all the local universities have joined in the work, bring- 
ing the total number of the classes to 63 in 1910, with 2,000 students. 
The tutorial classes differ essentially from the old form of university 
xtension work. They are limited in each case to groups of about 
0 students, and every student is bound to attend for a full course of 
years. Every class meets once a week during 24 weeks for a two 
ours’ session. The first hour is devoted to a lecture, the second to 
discussion of the principal points presented. The class exercise is 
upplemented by reading and the preparation of theses. Thus con- 
inuity and concentration are insured. The choice of tutors is in 
lhe hands of a tutorial class committee on which both the Workers’

Educational Association (W. E. A.) and the respective universities 
are represented. All the arrangements for the classes, times and 
places of meeting, books to be used, fees, etc., are also made by the 
committee.' 
In November, 1910, the proposal to make Greek optional at 
“‘Responsions”’ (the equivalent in Oxford of entrance examination) 
was rejected by ‘‘Congregation,” the vote standing 188 to 152. In 
May, 1911, the proposition was again submitted to “Congregation” 
and carried by a vote of 153 to 79. The privilege of omitting Greek 
was intended only for students who enter for degrees in science and 
mathematics. On November 28 the statute was rejected by Convo- 
cation, the final court of appeal, by a vote of 595 in a total of 955. 
The slowly advancing position of women students at Oxford is 
indicated by the statute which came into effect in October, 1910, 
establishing a ‘‘Delegacy for the control of resident women students. 
The names of all women students in residence who are candidates 
for university examinations must be presented to the university by 
a ‘recognized society’ and entered on a register by the delegates.” 
This measure has no relation to the discipline or control of students; 
it is the first official recognition by the university of the presence of 
women students. 
It may be recalled here that provision is made for women students 
at Lady Margaret Hall, Somerville College, St. Hugh’s College, and St. 
Hilda’s Hall, which, like Newnham College and Girton College, Cam- 
bridge, have no organic relation to the university. The students 
resident at these four colleges, numbering in 1911 about 600, are 
admitted to lectures at the two universities and also to examinations, 
but not to degrees. The large number of the women students from 
the colleges named who applied for degrees at Trinity College, Dublin, 
after that foundation threw open all its privileges to women, gave a 
new impulse to the movement for securing the same privilege for 
women at Oxford and Cambridge. Meanwhile Dublin University 
adopted a statute (1907) restricting its degrees to resident students.” 
At Cambridge University reforms are discussed, though less openly 
than at Oxford and, as a rule, with more restricted reference to th 
administration and business affairs of the university. In a curren 
review of these discussions, two subjects of general interest ar 
emphasized, namely, degrees for women and compulsory Greek. 
With respect to the former, the reviewer states that the time is no 
ripe for reopening the question. With respect to compulsory Gree 
he says: 
The time has already arrived for a satisfactory settlement of this question. Thi 
university can not compromise her reputation for humanity and sincerity by granti

   a degree in arts to Greekless students, but the solution lies along a bifurcation of studies. 
There are at present at least two bachelor degrees—in law and medicine—which are 
taken along with the B.A. In futureit will be necessary to add to these a bachelor of 
science, open to the mathematician as well as to the man of science strictly so called, 
but with the difference that with it the B. A. will only be taken by those students who 
have originally passed the classical part of the previous examination. Those who are 
unable to manage the Greek will be content with the B. Sc., which will lead to the 
M. Sc. and membership of the Senate, just as the B. A. leads to the M. A., and that 
without, of course, additional expense. At the present time the degree of LL. M. isin 
every way equivalent to that of M. A.? 
The position of Cambridge University as a ‘‘world center” of 
mathematical and physical research was emphasized during the 
present year by the publication of a volume giving a history of 
Cavendish Laboratory from the date of its establishment in 1871 to 
the present time. In that period of 40 years the laboratory has had 
three directors, all men of great distinction in the physical sciences. 
The first of these, J. Clerk-Maxwell, filled the position from 1871 till 
his death in 1879. He was succeeded by Lord Rayleigh, who retained 
the position until 1884, when he retired, pursuing his researches 
thenceforth in his private laboratory. During his incumbency regular 
courses for students were established and women were admitted to the 
laboratory. 
The successor of Lord Rayleigh was Prof. Joseph John Thomson 
(now Sir Joseph), who completed 25 years of service in the position 
in 1909. It was to commemorate this term of service, distin- 
guished by brilliant achievements, that the history of the laboratory 
was prepared by his colleagues. 
THE UNIVERSITY OF LONDON. 
The constitution of a teaching university for London is one of the 
most important events in the past decade. As an examining and 
degree-conferring institution the University of London dates from the 
charter of November 28, 1836. On the same day a charter was 
granted to University College, which was intended to provide for 
students desirous of matriculating for the university degrees. Kings 
College, founded in 1829, was also named in the university charter, 
together with several other colleges, as institutions whose students 
might present themselves for the degree examinations of the new 
university. In 1858 these examinations were opened to a great 
number of nonresident students, both men and women, and a London 
degree became a coveted sanction for many of the most aspiring and 
able students in Great Britain. By the University of London act of 
1898 this examining body was transformed into a complete university, 
nd in 1900 entered upon the larger responsibility of organizing and . 
xercising the highest order of teaching.

558 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
Through the principle of federation, which is working great changes 
in many parts of the British Empire, colleges and research centers 
hitherto existing as isolated units have been combined in one system. 
At the inception of the idea the interests of the metropolis, with its 
population of seven and a half millions, were uppermost, but these are 
already overshadowed by the sense of imperial relations. 
The university corporation includes at present no less than 15 
enierninty coleee and 13 medical schools, whose studets are classed as 
‘““internal.’”’ In addition to these there are several institutions having 
teachers recognized by the university and students preparing for the 
London examinations. In this second group are included about a 
dozen polytechnics, seven training colléges for teachers, three musical 
colleges, seven minor medical schools, and a number of pharmaceu- 
tical and veterinary colleges. The ‘‘external”’ students are not 
included in the registration given in Table 11. 
The interrelations and privileges of the several asa of this 
assemblage are defined by statute, and while innumerable details are 
yet to be worked out the formative principles of the organization are 
already indicated. Among these are the central control of examina- 
tions and the concentration of studies. The second principle has 
determined the present grouping of the federated bodies under eight 
faculties, namely, arts, law, medicine, theology, science, engineering, 
economics, and music. 
Plans for concentrating the highest order of instruction and research 
pertaining to each faculty have been discussed, but for the present 
this subject has been merged into that of a possible recasting of the 
entire system. This question, which has been constantly agitated 
since the passage of the act of 1898, was forced to an issue by the 
adoption of the ‘‘Imperial College of Science and Technology,” as a 
school of the university in 1908. The Imperial College was incor- 
porated in 1907 ‘‘to make provision for the most advanced training 
and research in science, especially in its application to industry.” 
Like the university, it is a federated body, including the Royal College 
of Science, the Royal School of Mines (originally maintained by the 
Science and Art Department), and the City and Guilds of London 
Institute, the latter supported by the city and the ancient guilds, 
henceforth to be known as ‘‘City and Guilds College.” 
It has been strongly urged that the Imperial College should be 
made an independent center for coordinating the various agencies 
equipped for the study of scientific problems in their bearing on indus- 
try. Thus Dr. Glazebrooks, the director of the National Physical 
Laboratory, in a recent address advised that the Imperial College 
should ‘‘possess the power itself of granting degrees in technological 
science to its students who have gone through its course and passed 
the proper tests without reference to any external academic body.”

EDUCATIONAL MOVEMENTS IN GREAT BRITAIN. 559 
As a consequence of opposing views, a royal commission was 
appointed in 1909 to examine into the federation system and into 
other facilities for higher education in London, with a view to advising 
desirable changes in their organization. It may be said, therefore, 
that the present University of London stands for a conviction and a 
purpose which have not yet been cast into permanent form. 
     
            
                                 
   
    
   
    
      
          
    THE LOCAL UNIVERSITIES. 
The local universities of England, like the national system of ele- 
mentary education, are the outcome of democratic impulses and 
industrial needs. They have been formed in part by the federation 
of technical schools, scientific institutions, and university extension 
centers; their history as universities belongs almost entirely to the 
first decade of the twentieth century. Exception may be made of 
Victoria University, Manchester, which received a charter in 1880, 
the constituent parts being Owens College and the Royal School of 
Medicine, both in Manchester. To these were added later University 
College, Liverpool, and Yorkshire College, Leeds. The former was 
incorporated with the University of Liverpool in 1903, and the latter 
was chartered as an independent university in 1904. As a conse- 
quence of these changes a new charter was obtained in 1903 for the 
Victoria University of Manchester, which, therefore, as at present 
constituted belongs to the decade covered by the table. 
The purposes in higher education which Victoria University em- 
phasized from the first, namely, those of service in the industrial 
world and of benefit to the physical welfare of mankind, characterize 
the entire group of modern universities. Their local relations and 
rapid increase are indicated by the cities whose names they bear and 
their dates of incorporation. These particulars are as follows: Bir- 
mingham, 1900; Bristol, 1909; Leeds, 1904; Liverpool, 1903; Shef- 
field, 1905. 
Like Victoria University, the University of Leeds was formed by 
the union of an existing scientific school—Yorkshire College—which 
dates from 1874, and the Leeds School of Medicine, founded in 1831. 
he nuclei of the other members of the group were also preexisting 
ocal societies and institutions, so that the university organization in 
ach case is the outcome of experience and matured plans. Situated 
n great manufacturing and commercial centers, the courses of study 
aintained by these universities have been planned to meet the 
emands of their environment, and while offering a modicum of 
lassical studies they give large place to modern languages and sci- 
mces and to the various branches of engineering, technology, and 
griculture. The technological department of the University of 
anchester is the most highly developed in England. At Leéds, the  
-P-A-G-E-580
    560 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
eenter of the wool industry, attention is given to mechanical engi- 
neering and industrial chemistry. Special provision is made by sev- 
eral institutions of this group fer commercial training, and the Uni- 
versity of Birmingham comprises a separate faculty of commerce. 
By reason of their origin these universities have naturally kept in 
close relation to the public elementary schools and have recognized 
the training of teachers as an important part of their work. For 
this, among many reasons, their facilities are open to women on the 
same terms as tomen. The standard of their education departments 
was set by Owens College, Manchester, in which a chair of education, 
the earliest in England, was endowed in 1900. The first to occupy 
the chair was Mr. H. L. Withers, a graduate of Oxford, who gained 
great distinction as a teacher and organizer. The vacancy caused 
by his sudden death was filled by Dr. J. J. Findlay, well known by 
his writings on education. Subsequently a professorship of the 
history and administration of education was established, to which 
Dr. Michael E. Sadler was appointed. 
At the outset these modern universities were more concerned in 
reaching the classes of students who were eager for their privileges 
than in the mere question of standards, and in pursuance of this 
purpose made liberal provision for evening classes. Their present 
scope is indicated by the following table, which includes also the local 
colleges and the colleges of London University participating in the 
annual grant made by Parliament for ‘‘universities and university 
colleges’ in England. The table includes, further, the constituent 
colleges of the University of Wales, which also receive annual appro- 
priations from the public treasury.

     Of the total grants from the treasury, £185,027 (about $900,000), 
_ nearly 24 per cent was allowed for the training of teachers of ele- 
mentary and secondary schools. This work is carried on in accord- | 
ance with regulations issued by the board of education. The total 
includes also a small amount, £6,800 ($34,000), from the board of 
agriculture for researches pertaining to agriculture in several of the 
institutions. é 
From a detailed statement of the incomes of the colleges included 
in Table 12, it appears that in the case of the English colleges 33 per 
cent of their total income is derived from fees, about 15 per cent 
from endowments, 144 per cent from local authorities, and 28 per 
cent from the public treasury. In the case of the Welsh colleges, 25 
per cent is derived from fees, about 6 per cent from endowments and 
the same proportion from local authorities, and 534 per cent from 
the public treasury. There remains about 10 per cent in each case 
to be supplied by private donations. 
The board of education, in its latest report on the university and 
university colleges, dwells upon the difficulty of securing private 
funds for the promotion of higher education in England. During 
the current year University College, Reading, has been singularly 
favored in this respect, an endowment fund of £200,000 ($1,000,000) 
having been presented, with the object of transforming the college 
into a university. Among other bequests for the current year are 
£30,000 to the University of London from the estate of Sir Francis 
Galton, for a department of national eugenics; £35,000 for mechanical 
engineering at Liverpool; and £30,000 to the same university for the 
endowment of a professorship of chemistry. The ‘‘City Companies” 
of London have given, as usual, large sums for promoting scientific 
research. Notwithstanding these donations, the official report notes 
that England is behind other countries in respect to the endowment 
of education by private benefactions. It calls attention to the fact 
that— 
within a year of its foundation the Kaiser Wilhelm Society for the Promotion of Science 
in Germany had at its disposal a capital of half a million sterling, which is being 
devoted to the equipment of institutes at which men already eminent in their respec- 
tive subjects will be installed. In France Monsieur Auguste Loutreuil left a sum 
of £284,000 toward the promotion of science in that country. In the United States 
Mr. Rockefeller handed over the sum of £764,000 to the Rockefeller Institute for| 
Medical Research, which he had previously endowed with large sums. 
The importance of the universities in the increasing scope of publi 
education and of national responsibility in the matter has bee’ 
recognized by the recent establishment of the Universities Branch o 
the Board of Education, which was organized in April, 1910. Mr. 
H. F. Heath, director of special inquiries and reports, was appointe
-P-A-G-E-583
  
EDUCATIONAL MOVEMENTS IN GREAT BRITAIN, 563 
to the office of principal assistant secretary for the new division. 
In respect to this special division it is officially stated—- 
that the technological and professional instruction (including the training of teachers 
for elementary and secondary schools) given by the universities and aided by grants 
from the board could not be properly dealt with as part of the ordinary administration 
of the board as applied to institutions which have less autonomy, responsibility, and 
prestige than the universities. The universities need the greatest possible degree 
of freedom in organizing and carrying out their important national and international 
functions. 
THE QUINCENTENARY OF ST, ANDREWS. 
The most interesting event of the year in university circles of Scot- 
land was the celebration of the five-hundredth anniversary of the 
foundation of the University of St. Andrews. As set forth in the 
university calendar: 
In the year of our Lord 1410, after the Feast of Pentecost, a university had its 
beginning in the city of St. Andrews of Kilrymont in Scotland, in the time of Henry 
de Wardlaw, Bishop, and James Biset, Prior of the same St. Andrews. A year anda 
half later, on 28th February 1412, Bishop Wardlaw, one of the best and wisest states- 
men of the old Scottish Church, granted a charter of Foundation. The Bishop and 
his Chapter petitioned Pope Benedict XIII for confirmation of the Charter, and 
King James I, then a prisoner in England, and afterwards a wise patron of the Univer- 
sity, which he honoured with the title of his ‘‘beloved daughter,”’ warmly joined in 
their request, and with such effect that on 28th August 1413, at Pefliscola in Spain, 
Benedict XIII confirmed the charter by several Bulls. These were duly taken to 
Scotland by Henry Ogilvy, Master of Arts, whose arrival in St. Andrews on 3rd February 
1414 was hailed with joy by all classes of the citizens. 
It is further recorded that— 
from 1410 to the present time, amid many changes in Church and State, the Univer- 
sity has carried on its work without a break. 
In the arrangements for the centennial celebration efforts were 
made to emphasize the historic traditions of the university, especially 
as related to the ancient colleges of St. Salvator, founded in 1450; 
St. Leonard’s, founded in 1512; and St. Mary’s, founded in 1537, 
all included in the university corporation. 
The relation of the university to the municipal life of the ancient 
city was also kept in mind, and in view of the fact that it is the oldest 
seat of learning in Scotland it was determined to make the assembly 
on this occasion ‘‘widely representative of Scotland and Scotsmen,” 
as well as the means of drawing together representatives of the prin- 
cipal learned societies and universities of the Old and the New World. 
These arrangements, as described by participants, were carried out 
with great effect. 
The principal academic events of the celebration, which occupied 
four days, were as follows: 
September 12.—The presentation of his portrait to Mr. Carnegie. 
This was a gift of the students, senate, and university court in recognition of their 
former rector’s munificence to the university, for to him it owes, amongst other things,

its fine Carnegie Park, pavilions, library, andgymnasium. The picture represents Dr. 
Carnegie in his robes as rector. Principal Sir James Donaldson made the presenta- 
tion on behalf of the subscribers, and Dr. Carnegie made a notable acknowledgment. 
     
        
    
                           
         
   
            September 13.—Commemoration service in Holy Trinity, the 
ancient town church, recently restored. To this service the officers 
and students of the university and the great company of delegates 
marched in imposing procession from the university quadrangle. 
The afternoon of the same day was occupied by the presentation of 
congratulatory addresses, to which eloquent response was made by 
the chancellor, Lord Balfour, of Burleigh. 
September 14.—The installation of the rector of the university, who 
is the chosen representative of the students. The choice had fallen 
upon the Earl of Roseberry, who now has held the rectorship in 
every Scottish university. His popularity was evidenced by the vast 
concourse of people which packed the assembly hall, still leaving an 
immense number outside. The address of the rector excited great 
enthusiasm, especially when he counseled the students to maintain— 
that self-reliance, that frugality, that resolute application to work, and that master- 
ful surmounting of difficulties which have made their countrymen thrive even under 
neglect and have won for them the respect of the world.' 
The rector’s address was followed by congratulations addressed to 
Sir James Donaldson, on the completion of his 25th year as principal 
of the university, and by the graduation ceremonies. The honorary 
degree of LL. D. was conferred upon 90 distinguished graduates, 
including both men and women, and the degree of D. D. upon 14 
men. 
September 15.—The closing exercises of the quincentenary were 
celebrated at Dundee in connection with University College, founded 
in 1880 by private endowment ‘‘to promote the higher education 
of the commercial and industrial classes,’”’ and affiliated to the uni- 
versity January 15, 1897. 
These more serious exercises were interpersed with historic pag- 
eants and brilliant social festivities. 
Il. THE STATE UNIVERSITIES OF FRANCE. 
In a recent sketch of the French universities, a professor at the 
Sorbonne says: ‘‘Twelve years of autonomous life in the full exercise 
of their rights and their scientific activity have given assurance of 
the success and the future of the young French universities.” The 
word young is significant, since the independent life of the univer- 
sities dates from the law of 1896; but in a sense, thus reconstructed, 
they are revivals of the universities of ancient France, and in the 
vigor and pride of their new life they cherish the traditions and the 
memorials of a glorious past.

It is proposed to consider here evidences of the progress of these 
institutions during the past decade, as disclosed in official reports 
and in the current literature of the subject, and confirmed by direct 
inquiry and correspondence on the part of this office. 
INCREASE IN THE STUDENT BODY. 
First among the signs of progress to be noted is the increase in the 
number of students. As shown by Table 13, this increase has been 
steady and marked during the decade, excepting in the case of one 
or two of the universities. At these smaller centers a process of 
scholastic specialization has been going on which promises to give 
them distinctive place in the general system.

In the decade covered by the foregoing table the total number of

the University of Paris alone the increase was above the average, 
amounting to 43 per cent; for the provincial universities taken to- 
gether, the increase was 33 per cent. The contingent of foreign stu- 
dents has contributed in a marked degree to this advance; in 1900

they numbered 1,770; in 1910, 5,241, a gain of 196.6 per cent during 
the decade. These numbers pertain to the winter sessions; in the 
summer sessions the number of foreigners is always greater; for in- 
stance, in 1910, it was 5,800, or 559 more than in the winter session 
of the same year. The numbers quoted relate solely to regularly 
inscribed students. There is also a large attendance of foreign stu- 
dents at the vacation courses maintained by several universities; 
in 1909, for instance, they numbered 1,399. Further, no account is 
here taken of students attending public lectures at the Collége de 
France, the Muséum, or the Conservatoire des Arts et Métiers. This 
proof of the extending reputation of the universities affords just 
gratification to the French authorities, who dwell also upon the 
evidence that it affects nearly every country. Russia has the largest 
representation in the student body, and the German Empire, exclu- 
sive of Alsace-Lorraine, stands second in this respect. 
It is interesting to note that the United States is comprised in a 
group of nine nations which contribute more than 100 students each. 
These nations are as follows:

INFLUENCES AFFECTING FOREIGN PATRONAGE. 
Among the various interests that draw foreign students to France, 
the value of the French language as a world medium is undoubtedly 
greatest; second only to this consideration is that of the facilities 
offered for scientific study and research, and the logical clearness of 
French expositions. To these inducements must be added special 
conditions made in the interests of foreign students; the most impor- 
tant of these was the institution-by decree of July 21, 1897, of a 
university doctorate. The regular French doctorate, it should be 
explained, is not only a scholastic title but a State diploma, carrying 
certain professional rights and privileges. The university doctorate 
 
-P-A-G-E-587
    THE STATE UNIVERSITIES OF FRANCE. 567 
created in 1897, carries full scholastic sanction but confers no civic 
or professional advantages in France, and, hence, does not place 
the foreigner in competition with his French comrades, neither does 
it require antecedent conditions that can be met only by natives. 
While the matter of the new doctorate was pending, a spontaneous 
movement led to the formation at Paris of a ‘‘Committee of Patron- 
age of Foreign Students,” comprising professors, students, and a 
number of high officials. The committee subsequently established 
branches in several university centers, its general purpose being to 
promote the welfare of foreign students by directing them to suitable 
residences, and in many ways drawing them into social relations. 
Especially helpful to the foreigners are the courses in the French 
language maintained by members of the committee. A correspond- 
ence bureau is conducted by the committee at Paris, which receives a 
subvention from the city council. Outside of Paris, the branches at 
Grenoble, Nancy, and Montpellier have been most active in this social 
effort. 
The attention of American students has been more and more 
drawn toward the French universities by the system of exchange pro- 
fessors, in which Harvard and Columbia participate. By a some- 
what similar arrangement very intimate relations have been estab- 
lished between the universities of France and those of Spain and 
Italy. The Ligue franco-écossaise has been eminently successful in 
exciting cordial sympathy between the student bodies of the two 
countries; the more recent Ligue franco-italao-rowmaine has for its 
special object the promotion of commercial and political relations, 
but it also increases the intellectual bonds between the three nations. 
The Franco-American committee, created in 1898, bore a very 
important part in the efforts that resulted in the special doctorate 
and has been constantly engaged in the endeavor to interest Ameri- 
can students in the facilities offered at the French universities. Fol- 
lowing this precedent, a union of the universities and special schools of 
France was organized in 1908 to establish relations with the Latin- 
American countries. 
During the present year the permanent secretary of the Franco- 
Latin union made a tour of Mexico, Chile, Brazil, and the Argentine 
Republic, with the purpose of promoting its interests; and in order 
to extend the knowledge of these countries in France, the union has 
founded a library of books and periodicals devoted to this subject. 
A special review, the Bulletin mensuel de la bibliotheque Americaine is 
maintained by the collaboration of savants of France and of the 
South American States. The Argentine Government has also 
created at the Sorbonne a chair of the economic and political history 
of Argentina.

In this widening circle of influence special interest attaches to the 
relations formed with the universities of southern Europe. Professors 
from the University of Bordeaux have at different times given courses 
of lectures at the Spanish universities, Madrid, Salamanca, Valladolid, 
Saragossa, and Oviedo, and during the present year Madrid and 
Oviedo have been represented at Bordeaux. From this intercourse 
sprang the idea of a permanent organ of intellectual exchange between 
the two nations, which has been realized by the establishment of the 
Institut frangais in Spain, through the united action of the Universities 
of Bordeaux, Toulouse, and Montpellier. In like manner, as a result 
of the exchange of lecturers and visiting delegates, Grenoble has estab- 
lished an Institut frangais at Florence. Undoubtedly these efforts 
have been inspired by the example of the long-existing French schools 
at Rome and at Athens, but the immediate purpose of the recent 
institutes is the formation of centers of influence and the diffusion of 
modern science and social doctrines. Thus the French universities 
are giving practical effect to the movement for international solidar- 
ity, long advocated by M. Bourgeois, eminent diplomat and former 
minister of public instruction. 
DISTRIBUTION OF STUDENTS BY FACULTIES. 
The universities of France, like those of Germany, are highly special- 
ized institutions in which students are prepared for professional or 
official careers. General education is the province of the lycées and 
colleges which prepare students for the bachelor’s degree, a prerequisite 
for matriculation at the universities. The term “ university” has, 
therefore, more restricted and more definite meaning than in the United 
States, where, under the prevailing influence of English traditions, 
liberal education forms an important, often the essential, part of the 
university system. Hence, also, the distribution of students by facul- 
ties serves as an index to the changing currents of intellectual life and 
of university demands in France.

THE STATH UNIVERSITIES OF FRANCE. 569 
From the distribution of the students among the different faculties, 
as shown in Table 15, it is seen that law attracts nearly 40 per cent of 
the entire number, and, further, that the faculty of letters has gained 
upon the faculty of sciences, which at the beginning of the decade had 
the larger registration. This increasing attendance upon the faculty 
of letters is due in great measure to the changing requirements of the 
teaching force of the secondary schools, which is recruited chiefly 
from the two faculties considered. Among other causes for the gain in 
letters is the preference of foreign students. The number of foreigners 
in the faculties of science rose in the decade from 278 to 1,208, an in- 
crease of 334 per cent; in letters, from 215 to 1,708, an increase of 694 
per cent. This very large advance justifies the claim on the part of 
the French authorities that the demand for the language and, as a 
consequence, the influence of the nation are increasing in the world. 
The faculty of letters, it may be said, especially the Paris faculty, is 
a nursery of liberal ideas. 
The increased attendance upon the faculties of letters and science 
is due in part to the system of bourses (scholarship funds) adopted by 
the Government in the early days of the Republic, with the purpose 
of assuring a sufficient number of candidates for the teaching service of 
secondary schools. At that time the faculties were purely examin- 
ing juries and few candidates were forthcoming for the licence (diploma 
required for regular professorships) or for the agrégation (examination 
for special professors). In order to induce young men of promise, but. 
of limited means, to enter the service, Government bourses were 
created to be awarded upon competitive examination. The number 
of candidates admitted to this provision each year is, however, strictly 
limited, and at present the boursiers form a very small proportion of 
the entire number of students in the two faculties named. 
By the reorganization of secondary studies (decree of May 31, 1902) 
a road is opened from primary schools to the scientific faculties 
through the assimilation of the modern course in the lycées to that of 
the higher primaries. This arrangement was made both in the in- 
terests of the teaching service of primary schools and:also as a means 
lof enabling ambitious youths among the industrial classes to prepare 
themselves for more effective service in the practical affairs of life. 
The increase in the attendance upon the faculties of law has taken 
lace chiefly in the Paris faculty, which comprises at the present time 
8 chairs or full professorships with a large corps of subordinate in- 
tructors (chargés de cours et d’agrégés). The Paris faculty registers 
,000 students, or nearly half the number in the law faculties of the 
6 universities. 
Legal studies in France are the direct preparation for official posi- 
ions, which explains, in part, the excess of students in the law faculties. 
additional cause is found. in the recent extensions of the curricula

to provide for new problems of law arising from industrial progress 
and international relations. In provincial universities, for example, 
may be mentioned a course in the history of law and of juridical in- 
stitutions of the East at Nancy, and a course in industrial legislation 
and economy at Montpellier. 
The increase in the attendance upon the medical faculty is relatively 
less than in the other faculties. This is due largely to the extension 
of the preparatory studies, with a consequent advance in the entrance 
requirements, and further to the increased severity of the medical 
course itself. It may be recalled here, that by a decree of 1893 a 
special certificate in the scientific studies—physics, chemistry, and 
natural sciences (the ‘‘P. C.N.”’), as related to the medical course— 
wasinstituted, requiring a year’s study in a faculty of science. From 
that time, the need of a complete reform of the medical course itself was 
urged by professors and physicians, and in 1907 a Government com- 
mission was appointed to investigate and report upon the subject. 
The outcome of their recommendations was the decree of January 11, 
1909, providing for radical changes in the course of medical instruction 
and in the examinations for the diploma. This decree required that 
all candidates for admission to the medical faculties should have 
obtained the bachelor’s degree. In addition to the preparatory year 
of study in the faculty of sciences leading to the special certificate in 
physics, chemistry, and natural sciences (the “P.C. N.’’), the student 
of medicine must complete the full five-year course, each year being 
nine months in duration. Every student is also required to assist at 
the appointed clinics and to make up the full hospital term.t 
Complaint is still made that these reforms can not be completely 
carried out from lack of adequate equipment, especially in regard to 
laboratory and clinical facilities. In a few centers, particularly Paris, 
Lyon, and Nancy, municipal appropriations and private donations 
have contributed materially to this work. 
        
     
                                  
       
     
   WOMEN STUDENTS. 
A noticeable feature of the university record for the decade is the 
increasing number of women students, their distribution among the 
faculties, and the nationalities which they represent. 
The number and distribution of women students in 1905 and 1909 
respectively, were as follows:

Thus in four years the contingent of women students was in- 
creased by nearly 90 per cent. The total for 1909 included 2,916 
native French women. Russia had the largest representation 
among the 680 foreigners. As to the equality accorded women in 
university circles, it will suffice to recall the impartial appreciation 
of their graduating theses, illustrated the present year by the note 
“very honorable” inscribed on the doctor’s diploma accorded to a 
Polish student, Mme. Lipinska, by the Paris faculty of letters.    
   
       
    
                                           
       
    
    
   
   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SPECIAL DIPLOMAS. 
As a consequence of the restored independence of the French 
universities, their energies have been turned more and more to the 
vital interests of modern life. An index to the growth in this re- 
spect is furnished by the special diplomas awarded by the different 
faculties in accordance with a decree of July 21, 1897. In the last 
three years alone, 24 of these restricted diplomas have been insti- 
tuted, representing 12 of the 15 universities, and illustrating by 
their titles distinguishing specialties of each. Among these recent 
sanctions are the diploma for special courses in philosophy, history, 
geography, philology, and the certificate for financial and adminis- 
trative studies authorized at Paris in 1908; diploma for foreigners 
in French language and literature, given at Grenoble; diploma of 
electrical engineer, and a special diploma in agriculture at Toulouse 
In this turning of the energies and resources of the universities 
toward the service of industry, particular prominence is given to the 
sciences applicable to agriculture. The University of Besangon, 
for example, maintains a laboratory for agricultural analysis, a 
laboratory of agricultural bacteriology, and two stations, one for 
experiments with seeds, the other for the culture of conifers and 
of the most fruitful plants; Bordeaux, with the cooperation of the 
Departments of the Gironde and Landes and the Chambers of Com- 
merce of Bordeaux and Mont-de-Marsan, has provided special equip- 
ment for the study of resin and its industrial applications; the 
University of Nancy, supplied during the past decade with the finest 
assemblage of industrial institutes to be found in France, added at 
the beginning of the present decade an agricultural institute of the 
highest order. It comprises, as courses of instruction common to 
all students, agricultural botany, agricultural zoology and zoo- 
technics, and agricultural chemistry and geology, and, as special 
courses of instruction, economic branches, forestry, physics, and 
practical agriculture. 
OFFICIAL CHARACTER OF THE UNIVERSITIES. 
The autonomy conferred upon the universities by the law of 1896 
restricted by their official relations to the Government. The 
umber of professors for each university is determined by law, and  
-P-A-G-E-592

they are appointed by the minister of public instruction, acting in 
advice with the university councils. The salaries of the professors 
are fixed by law and paid by the State. The universities are also 
charged with the duty of conferring the degrees or State diplomas. 
The bachelor’s degree is the goal of ‘‘secondary education” and is 
required for matriculation in the university faculties. The ordinary 
degrees conferred in course by the faculties are as follows: Faculty 
of letters and of science, the diploma of licencié and of doctor; also 
by the faculty of science, the special certificate of scientific studies 
required for admission to the medical faculty; faculty of law, degree 
of bachelor, of licencié, and of doctor; faculty of medicine, degree 
of doctor. The diploma examinations are regulated by. official 
decrees and they practically determine the courses of instruction in 
the several faculties. The burden imposed upon the professors 
appointed on the examining juries may be inferred from the number 
of diplomas annually awarded. For the year 1909, the latest for 
which the data are available, there were conferred 6,973 diplomas 
of bachelor, marking the close of “secondary education.” The 
number of diplomas conferred in the faculty courses were as follows: 
In law, 360 certificates of capacity, 2,291 diplomas of bachelor, 
2,201 of licentiate, 559 of doctor; in medicine, 909 diplomas of 
doctor, 267 of dental surgery, and 360 midwife certificates; in phar- 
macy, 366 diplomas and 157 herbalist licenses; in sciences, 484 
diplomas of licentiate (licencié), 39 of doctor, and 1,370 special cer- 
tificates (P. C. N.) required in addition to the bachelor’s degree for 
admission to the medical faculties; in the faculty of letters, 531 
diplomas of licentiate and 31 of doctor. 
The above numbers pertain only to successful candidates who 
form, perhaps, two-thirds of the total number examined. 
       
                                  
      
         
     
       UNIVERSITY INCOMES. 
In the reports of the financial status of the several universities 
the receipts are classified as the ordinary and the extraordinary 
income. The former comprises the revenues from property and 
the interest of invested funds, the fees for matriculation, lecture 
fees, library and laboratory fees, the receipts from university publi- 
cations, the State appropriations for current expenditures, appro- 
priations by the Departments and cities, and all other sources of 
permanent character. The extraordinary income includes gifts an 
legacies, loans, appropriations for building or other special purposes, 
and all other funds intended to meet temporary demands. Eac 
faculty comprised within a university has its own separate budget,

may, however, make arrangements for additional service to be paid 
for out of its own resources. 
In giving up to the universities the receipts from fees, which were 
formerly turned over to the State treasury, it was decided that they 
must be applied wholly to objects of immediate advantage to the 
students, such as the equipment of laboratories, libraries, new 
buildings, ete. Apart from these specific limitations, the universities 
have free disposal of their resources.

From Table 16 it appears that the combined incomes of the 15 
universities in France, excluding Algiers, in 1906 aggregated 
$2,650,095, of which amount Paris received $1,363,787, or a little 
more than half the total. In 1909 the amount was $2,242,290, of 
which Paris received less than half, namely, $945,153. Partial 
statements for intervening years indicate that the decline in the 
incomes, total and particular, in 1909, as compared with 1906, is due 
to fluctuations in the amounts received from gifts, legacies, etc., 
or what are termed extraordinary sources, rather than to a falling 
off in the receipts from ordinary sources. The latter include fees 
and State and local appropriations, which, as a rule, increase from 
ryear to year. From official statements for the years intervening 
between 1906 and 1909 it appears that Paris reached its maximum 
income in 1908, namely, $1,567,132. This was also the most profit- 
lable year for Nancy and Lyon. 
It should be recalled in this connection that in the years immedi- 
tely preceding and following the passage of the law of 1896 the 
ork of providing suitable buildings and equipments for the uni-

versities was pushed with great vigor, and as the need arises special 
appropriations are made for these purposes. The large sums 
expended by the municipalities and Departments in aid of these_ 
material appliances raised the expectation of liberal support from 
the same source as the reconstituted universities should develop 
their local adaptations. In a measure this hope has been realized, 
but there is still urgent need for increased resources. It is a need 
which has been repeatedly urged upon the Chamber of Deputies by 
M. Steeg, who has recently been appointed minister of public instruc- 
tion. 
     
     
    
   
                                    
   
    
   
    
   
    
   
   CENTRAL IMPORTANCE OF PARIS. 
The development of the provincial universities of France is an 
important feature of the recent progress of higher education. It has 
not only increased the intellectual life of the country, but it has 
multiplied its scientific forces. At the same time Paris remains 
the chief center of learning and research. The new Sorbonne, 
whose completion was celebrated in 1909, endowed the university 
with an edifice worthy of its ancient prestige and of its renewed 
vigor. The influence of this central university upon the general 
system of higher education was increased by the fusion of the Ecole 
Normale Supérieure with the university, which was accomplished 
in 1907. The function of this school has been the preparation of a 
select body of young men for professorships in the higher classes of 
the State lycées. The candidates are selected by competitive 
examinations, and their expenses during the four years’ training 
are at the charge of the State. In its new rn the Ce 
serves the university as a professional faculty or “‘seminar.’ 
The latest addition to the University of Paris is the Aerotechnic 
Institut, founded by M. Henry Deutsch (de la Meurthe), who donated 
for the purpose 500,000 francs ($100,000) and an annual income of 
15,000 francs ($3,000) for its maintenance during his life. The 
building erected for this new establishment occupies a site adjoining 
. the drill campus of the military school Saint-Cyr, about 25 kilo- 
meters from Paris. It is equipped for researches and experiments 
bearing upon aerial locomotion, with a constant view to the practical 
mastery of the art and. the perfection of aerial machines. The 
institut will be under the direction of the dean of the faculty of 
sciences, of which it is an adjunct. It was officially inaugurated 
with brilliant ceremony July 8, 1911.1 
Notwithstanding recent transformations it has proved difficult to 
overcome the specialized character stamped upon the faculties unde 
the old system, and complaint is made that the universities are stil

wanting in the true spirit of corporate life. It was in part as a 
means of correcting the tendency to isolated activity on the part of 
the Paris faculties that. the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes was 
created by a decree of July 31, 1868. Its purpose, as explained in 
the decree, is that of ‘‘maintaining side by side with the theoretic 
instructions (given by faculties) the applications which fortify and 
extend them.” The school is divided into four sections: Mathematics, 
physics and chemistry, natural history and physiology, historical 
and philological sciences. It has no building of its own nor definite 
program; but all the resources of the Sorbonne, libraries and labora- 
tories, are at its disposal, and the professors and savants in charge 
of its sections conduct their little groups of special students to the 
one or the other of these centers, or meet them in rooms assigned for 
lectures and conference, as circumstances demand. This arrange- 
ment has emphasized the unity of the sciences, but it has not in- 
creased the organic unity of the faculties. The sense of this unity 
has been preserved in some measure at the Paris University by its 
historic continuity. Similar traditional influences form a bond of 
union in the provincial universities which is strong in proportion to 
their ancient renown. : 
The University of Paris, itself, is the central body in a group of 
higher institutions devoted to the humanities which are included in 
Table 17. They are supplemented by technical and art schools of 
world-wide distinction which pertain to other ministries than that of 
public instruction. To this public provision for liberal and technical 
education at the capital is added the most important of the private 
universities of France, which includes a faculty of Catholic theology. 
A private faculty of Protestant theology was also established in 1906. 
The increasing provision for modern studies at the French capital 
is illustrated by the Ecole libre des sciences politiques, the Collége 
des libre des sciences sociales, the Ecole des hautes sociales, and the 
Ecole de journalisme, all founded within the decade by private bene- 
factions. 
Higher education in Paris and, it may be said, in the world, has 
suffered great loss by the recent deaths of M. Pierre-Emile Levasseur 
and M. Alfred Binet. The former had very nearly completed his 
eighty-third year and maintained up to the time of his death those 
researches which had placed him at the head of social and statisti- 
cal sciences in France. He was administrative chief of the Collége 
de France and vice president of the Commission supérieure de statis- 
tique of France and also of the Institut international de statistique. 
M. Binet was a recognized leader in the field of experimental psy- 
chology and the director of the investigations in this subject carried 
on in the laboratory of the Sorbonne, which are effecting radical 
fhanges in the current philosophy of education.

CHAPTER XX. 
RECENT MOVEMENTS IN HIGHER AND SECONDARY 
EDUCATION IN GERMANY. : 
By WitHetm Minou, 
Professor of Pedagogy in the University of Berlin. 
The development of the German universities during the last 
hundred years has undeniably raised them in the eyes of the scientific 
world, but at the same time it has given rise to practical difficulties 
which are more and more felt and, here and there, much deplored. 
German professors regard scientific research rather than teaching 
as their distinguishing task, or at least their teaching mostly takes 
the shape of initiation into the methods of research. Their lecturing 
has thus assumed such an abstract character that the student coming 
from a higher school in the proud possession of a ‘‘certificate of 
maturity,” usually finds the transition to the new atmosphere of 
thought very hard, and commonly wastes more than one term merely 
in finding a footing. At the other end, the step from the university 
into a profession is the reverse of easy; the medical faculty, with its 
clinical hospitals and similar arrangements, is really the only one 
which offers a direct training for the future, though the theological, 
with its homiletic-catechetical seminaries, might be classed with the 
medical. Only after the portals of the university have closed behind 
them do law students begin their practical work in a course lasting 
several years. Aspirants to higher posts in schools long had only one 
year’s preliminary exercise. The need of a more thorough pedagogical 
training, however, gradually made itself felt; at first, in Prussia, 
as far back as 20 years ago, and afterwards in other German States 
a two years’ theoretical and practical course was made generally 
compulsory. Even those States which still hold to the one-year 
system have made the course much more difficult than before. The 
universities for their part aim exclusively, or almost exclusively, at 
merely supplying an introduction to the subjects which are after- 
wards to be taught in the professional schools. The way this knowl-

   A more adequate view of the matter seems, however, to be spread- 
ing. In the meantime a year’s practical training, complementary to 
the studies and examinations, has been added to the medical course, 
and a similar provision has been made for evangelical theology. In 
the university itself the importance of mental intercourse between 
the professors and their students is more widely recognized, due to 
the further development of the university seminaries; even those | 
professors and ‘‘privatdocents’”’ who do not conduct official semina- 
ries usually hold so-called ‘‘exercises” in addition to their lectures. 
The throng of students is great on all such occasions; they themselves 
feel strongly how much less they gain in mental culture from mere 
listening to lectures.1_ Nevertheless the institution must be regarded 
as in some respects very incomplete. In many subjects the seminary 
deals only with strictly scientific questions (from which the themes 
for dissertations are frequently drawn), whereas more practical 
discussions are equally desirable. Besides this the number of those 
admitted is usually rather small, and indeed not unwisely so, because 
it is only then that a lively debate becomes possible; a too numerous 
membership easily tends to make thé individuals embarrassed and 
silent. In most cases, too, only those students are admitted who have 
-already been several terms in the university, whereas it is precisely 
the freshman who is most in need of help. The whole system is in 
fact capable of much development; for younger lecturers and for older 
and proved students, a field of useful labor is here opened. 
The absence of all unifying personal guidance of the student’s 
course of study is not infrequently felt to be a weakness in German 
university life, yet few people wish for definite or printed curricula, 
even if these should be only for the sake of suggestion. Full ‘‘aca- 
demic freedom” proves, as a matter of fact, a benefit only to students 
of much intelligence and firm character. It was glorified into a 
principle in a period of idealism, is still defended by the idealists, 
and, to say the least, presupposes approximately ideal students. But 
the time is long past when only a small body of young men pressed 
to the university and when one could generally take mental gifts and 
independent initiative for granted. The crowds nowadays are grow- 
ing beyond all calculation, multiplying from one year to another. 
What wonder if the productivity of the average student decreases on| 
that account. The less gifted spirits demand fuller guidance. 
Although very few of the scholars in the last class of the higher schools} 
fail in their final examination, four or five years later only the smalle 
part can show really good results of their independent study. It isi 
fact only the more distinguished who rise; the ordinary individual   
1 For instance, the number of those taking part in the seminary exercises of the national economy schoo} 
in the University of Berlin has risen during the last 10 years from not more than 50 to about 300. Th 
exercises consist of short accounts by the students of appointed subjects, criticisms, and debates; but essays 
are also written, adjudged, and corrected.

    HIGHER AND SECONDARY. EDUCATION IN GERMANY. 579 
fall back. Some now declare that the lecture system has lived its day 
and that a method in which dialogue should predominate ought to 
take its place; others—and such a conspicuous thinker as the late 
Friedrich Paulsen was among their number—regard the lecture 
system as the most effective, to be surpassed and replaced by no 
other. As a matter of fact, it will doubtless remain the preferred 
form, and reasons for that would not be hard to find. One must not 
regard the mere listening to a great variety of lectures as the student’s 
main business, especially, as too often happens, when the listening is 
of a fragmentary nature; much time and strength are thus wasted. 
On the whole it is not strange that the demand should at intervals 
have arisen for a special ‘academic pedagogy” as a new science. 
In an age when all questions of preuniversity education are carefully 
considered and measures taken in accordance, indifference ought not 
to prevail toward the succeeding years and their educational claims. 
The academic chair also claims its principles and regulations. There 
should be no shrinking from a discussion of the problem, for the psy- 
chology of the student period deserves an exhaustive observation 
which it has not yet received. A former privatdocent of Munich, 
Dr. Schmidkunz, has made the furtherance of this view his mission for 
some years past, and has won over several important university lights 
tohis Union of Academic Pedagogy (Verband fiir Hochschulpadagogik). 
On the whole, however, not much attention is paid to the movement. 
People are afraid of losing, or at least limiting, the foundation of the 
fame of German universities, namely, the complete personal liberty 
of the students and the effect of their being in immediate touch with 
greater minds. 
If it was already hard enough for the freshman to gain a footing 
in the new mental atmosphere, to understand the abstract language, 
and to follow the closer line of thought; and if it was at the same time 
not exactly easy for the professor to find the right way of fascinating 
the cleverer spirits without repelling the weaker, the difficulty has 
become still greater for both parties, because pupils have been ad- 
mitted to the university, not only from the classical schools (human- 
istischen Gymnasien), but also indiscriminately from the various 
chools which have a nine years’ curriculum.1 This has been the 
ase in Prussia for the last 10 years and with some variations has been 
radually adopted by most of the other German States. The procla- 
ation of the Kaiser, or rather King of Prussia, which approved this 
nnovation (November, 1900), was only the sanction of a resolution 
assed at a general conference of professional men and confidential 
dvisers. This resolution was founded on the determination of the   
1 There are four kinds of higher schools with the nine years’ course in Germany, the Gymnasium, in which 
lho main attention is given to classical languages, the Realgymnasium in which classical and modern ten- 
encies are balanced, and the Oberrealschule and Realschule in which the modern or scientific side vastly 
redominates.

   supporters of the classical schools not to oppose the admission of 
pupils from the modern schools (Oberrealschulen), or from schools of 
the mixed system (Realgymnasien), in the hope that the superiority 
of the classical schools would be the more clearly proved by the free 
competition, and especially also that they would be released from the 
incubus of such pupils as in quality, or degree of ability, were out of 
place there. Now, it had never been intended that the modern and 
mixed schools should regard themselves thenceforward chiefly as 
preliminary stages to the university. It was expected that only 
those few pupils from them who felt a special call to higher scientific 
studies would take advantage of the new privilege, while the majority 
would devote themselves as before to more everyday ends. It is, 
however, undeniable, that a much greater percentage of the students 
in these more practical institutions is streaming into the university 
than is desirable; and what is worse, they enter, not for the sake of 
working in those subjects for which they had been chiefly trained 
(which were already free to them in the university), but in almost. 
all other subjects as well, with the exception perhaps of theology. 
The allurement of the new liberty has clearly taken effect here, but 
just as clearly also the idea of the social distinction which accom- 
panies the academic calling. For in Germany, particular industrial 
districts excepted, university men are still regarded socially as an 
upper class, to which, in the eyes of the public, only the nobility, the 
official class, and perhaps the most distinguished artists are superior. 
Convincing statistics of the results of the university work of 
students from modern schools in comparison with that of students 
from classical schools are at present not attainable. Great im- 
portance is not laid on figures and average results; the examinations, 
which must after all be the chief means of information, are affected| 
by many different factors which can not be weighed and measured, 
the addiction of the examiners to the method in which they them 
selves were schooled being possibly one of them. On the whole 
however, judging from a number of personal opinions, the result 
certainly do not seem to denote a triumph for the modern schools 
From the classical schools also, it is true, the number of those is no 
small whose mental capacity does not mark them for scientific study 
and on the other side there are always to be found among the student: 
from the modern schools individuals of conspicuous talent and th 
highest aspirations who do creditable work in each subject. Th 
students coming from the modern schools can indeed always b 
praised for their steady industry, to which several causes tend. Bu 
still the predominating impression is that the foundation gained doe| 
not fit them well for the study of science, and that in the great d 
mand for training in exact sciences, a sense does not develop itse 
for other departments. Though the fact that Latin is necessary f
-P-A-G-E-601
    HIGHER ANY SECONDARY EDUCATION IN GERMANY. 581 
anyone who wants to be at home in the world of scientific terminology 
is perhaps of minor importance, many modern schools (Oberreal- 
schulen) have already introduced Latin into their curricula, to the 
great burdening of the pupils. The Realgymnasien, though the most 
of their time is devoted to the exact sciences and modern languages, 
have Latin in common with the classical schools and turn out pupils 
some of whom are similar in mental caliber to those from the classical, 
and some to those from the modern schools. Naturally it will always 
be the case that in the schools in which the exact sciences predomi- 
nate, pupils who wish to devote themselves to higher study will go 
to the schools of technology (technische Hochschulen), which—a 
further important feature of our civilization—are in the midst of a 
progressive development. 
It may here be mentioned that two new institutions of this sort 
have been recently added in Prussia to the three already existent, viz, 
in Breslau and Danzig; there is the same number, namely, five, scat- 
vered over the rest of Germany. The Kaiser, who, as is well known, 
takes a lively interest in modern technical education, has elevated 
the schools of technology in his own Kingdom to the level of the 
universities, by conferring on the rectors the same honors and privi- 
leges. The student life in these institutions, as is not surprising, 
has formed itself after that in the older universities, though the 
students in the former are tied much more to definite courses of 
studies and each session to fixed tasks. They have to work thor- 
oughly hard; the exact sciences, and especially technical subjects, 
admit of no disconnectedness of knowledge, scarcely even of sub- 
jectivity of choice. 
A further change during the last few years is the right conferred 
on women to study at universities in full equality with men, whereas 
formerly they could only attend as hearers. Their number is grow- 
ing from year to year. Up to the present time it has been almost 
impossible to compare their working capacity with that of the men 
students. Almost all have come to the university at a maturer age 
and with a different preparatory education, and usually only those 
of really good talent and ardent ambition have made the attempt. 
Things will, however, be different in a few years, especially, for exam- 
ple, as women teachers in the higher schools in the future will have 
the chance of good posts only when they have gone through exactly 
the same studies and examinations as the male teachers. On this 
account, many find themselves driven to study whose mental gifts 
are by no means eminent and whose physical powers are doubtful. 
It 1s already strikingly clear that women holding fixed appointments 
require leave of absence on account of weak health much oftener 
than men.

       582 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
The increase in the number of foreigners at the German. universities 
steadily continues, but has recently had to be checked. Too many 
individuals of doubtful education, and frequently also leading very 
questionable lives, forced themselves in, particularly from the eastern 
European countries, and took up the space and the best seats at the 
practical exercises, crowding aside the German students. Visitors 
from America or England will hardly be likely to find the recent 
measures of restriction an obstacle; their previous education is often 
excellent. It is of course the natural and desirable thing that only 
those students of a nation should be sent abroad who have distin- 
guished themselves above the average. The dark sides of the Ger- 
man university system above mentioned apply but little to such; 
the lectures of the most distinguished professors are precisely what 
they have come for, and the arrangement of their studies can be con- 
fidently left to themselves. There are, by the way, many things 
going on to make the stay in Germany more fruitful for foreigners. 
There is a prospect that the so-called Béttinger House, a home for 
English and American students in Germany, will soon be removed 
from Gdttingen to Berlin, and its facilities greatly extended. It 
stands to reason that Berlin, with its many means of education, can 
offer all sorts of valuable opportunities to strangers; but from certain 
other points of view other universities might be better, especially at 
first. Medical students, for instance, find it difficult to carry out 
their aims at Berlin, on account of the crowds which throng the 
laboratories. Wiirzburg, Freiburg, and probably Giessen also would 
be more suitable. For theology, in the same way, Halle, along with 
Berlin, is suitable; for philosophy as well as for jurisprudence, Heidel- 
berg; for ancient languages, Géttingen; for modern, Géttingen, Bonn, 
and Marburg; for pedagogy, Jena and Leipzig; for experimental 
psychology, Breslau and Leipzig; for art, Munich; for agriculture, 
once more Halle. These hints, however, must be taken as incom- 
plete, and conditions easily change. 
As is only natural, the various branches of learning differentiate 
themselves more and more from one another, and thus, through 
the splitting up of departments already existing and through the 
extension of study over quite new fields, new chairs become needed. 
As recent examples may be mentioned the creation or revival at 
the University of Berlin of professorships in the history of religions, 
colonial science, and Persian, while a variety of foreign languages 
have long been practically taught at the oriental seminary here. 
On the other hand, various well-justified demands still remain 
unfulfilled. Thus, while classical languages are everywhere repre- 
sented by several professors (especially when one counts archeology, 
epigraphy, the history of ancient constitutions and culture along 
with them), only the most necessary chairs have heretofore been     
    
   
        
                      
-P-A-G-E-603
  HIGHER AND SECONDARY EDUCATION IN GERMANY. 583 
created for modern languages, usually only one for the entire romance 
philology (even at Berlin it is no better) and one for English, in 
spite of its wide range and importance. Some casual assistance is 
given chiefly by privatdocents. Undoubtedly this state of things 
can not last. Further, there are lacking (in sharp contrast particu- 
larly to North America) the much-needed chairs of pedagogy, to 
which people in many quarters still refuse the title of a science, 
though their objections have often enough been confuted. It is 
usually regarded only as a sort of minor division’ in the department 
of psychology, although several other sciences, like ethics, political 
science, and the history of civilization, trench on that subject just 
as much. Only very gradually is progress being made here, A 
pedagogical seminary on a grand scale is expected to be organized 
soon at Halle University, and at Berlin, too, a seminary is no longer 
to be completely wanting. Such institutions have long existed at 
Jena and Leipzig, outside of Prussia. In the latter place especially 
it is made possible, even comparatively easy, for the teachers of 
the elementary schools to finish their university studies with the 
.Fh. D., and much advantage is taken of this. Among this class 
of teachers there is a strong movement to have the teacher’s profes- 
sional training removed from the present organizations, teachers’ 
‘seminaries, to the university, but against this many objections 
have been urged with success. * 
Of greater interest for foreign readers are perhaps the movements 
which are going on in the German student world. To put it briefly, 
the students’ clubs (Corps, Landsmannschaften, etc.) of the older 
form are losing ground to those which are founded on newer princi- 
ples. The essential basis of the older corporations was and is the 
firm formation of a powerful community for the cultivation of bold- 
ness and courage, steadfast friendship, social and light-hearted 
enjoyment of youth; in practice, however, this is combined with 
considerable love of fighting and drinking, preservation of outworn 
ceremonies, and thoughtless pursuit of pleasure. Many of these 
bodies have at present but few members. At the same time the 
spirit which inspired them is by no means dead and in certain uni- 
versities, chiefly smaller ones, their characteristic way of life remains 
to this day. More prosperous, however, are the scientific societies, 
the athletic organizations, and those based on national, ethical, or 
Christian principles. And it is in keeping with the spirit of the 
time as well as with academic tradition that the societies of similar 
aims at the various universities bind themselves together into united 
bodies. Even for the students who are not in favor of special clubs 
  
1 In university circles there isa movement also to raise the whole academic position of the “additional” 
(ausserordentlich) professors, who have gradually become very numerous and wish to be more fully incor= 
porated into the organism oi the faculties, instead of figuring, as has been the case heretofore, only on th¢ 
outside, wichout possessing any rights worth mentioning.
-P-A-G-E-604
  584 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
a kind of organization (the Freie Studentenschaft) has been formed, 
in which smaller groups are always being arranged for mutual studies, 
various kinds of sport, good fellowship, the cultivation of political 
and social interests, and other educative purposes. The erection 
of student homes—badly needed it must be acknowledged—has 
here and there been begun; for example, in Charlottenburg.t 
The relationship of the university to the school has been repeatedly 
and publicly discussed during the last years, and prominent repre- 
sentatives of both, and especially of the former, have taken part. 
“What should be the ideal of the higher schools in order to fit their 
pupils best for the advanced studies?” the university professors 
ask, and answer according to their own bias. On the other side 
it is asked, “What ought the university to do in order to produce 
really well-trained teachers for the higher schools?” and criticism 
of the present means is not wanting. Space is lacking here for 
discussion of details. The universities have up to the present 
time enjoyed the confidence of the nation much more generally 
than have the schools, although this is not wholly justified. 
The number of pupils attending the higher schools, and the number- 
of these schools themselves, has increased within recent years. 
For Prussia the total number of male pupils in these institutions, 
apart from the primary schools and preparatory classes frequently 
linked to them, rose from 162,057 in 1901 to 226,693 in 1910. With 
the girls it is similar. As for the boys’ higher schools themselves, 
the number of complete schools, those with a nine-year course, 
increased during the same time from 408 to 586. It is here note- 
worthy that in 1901 the majority of these still represented the 
classical type; in 1910, this type had only 47 per cent. The Real- 
gymnasien and Oberrealschulen have thus experienced a big increase, 
not difficult to explain from the cultural tendency of the age. This 
change will apparently go considerably farther. The allowances 
which the Prussian State grants to the above-mentioned schools 
increased in the same period (1901-1910) from a little more than 
  
1 Mention may be made of the “Academic Olympia” held this summer in Drésden, at which student 
clubs from all sorts of universities competed in rowing, fencing, swimming, athletics, etc. 
2State grants, especially for the further scientific training of teachers, have been steadily increased. 
On traveling scholarships abroad (for archeologists, students of modern languages, etc.), on holiday courses, 
and such arrangements more than 100,000 marksare spent yearly. To this belongs also the further develop- 
ment of the international exchange of young teachers. 
# The number of so-called reform schools (which begin Latin not until the fourth year) has gradually 
risen to 130 in Prussia; the arrangement is steadily growing more frequent, not in connection with the 
properly classical schools, but chiefly in connection with the mixed system, the ‘“Realgymnasien.” The 
junction of several kinds of schools into one system under the same principal (e. g., the Gymnasium with 
the Realschule, etc.) ismuch commoner than formerly. The variety of school species officially recognized 
is altogether on the increase. The lower schools, or elementary classes, joined to the higher schools (which 
are, however, only found in a number of them) have also increased within the last 10 years corresponding 
to the increase of the schools in general. At the same time there exists in many parts of the country a 
strong movement against the continuation of such special schools for the higher social class and for the 
sending of all children to the common elementary school. It is of course only to be expected that as soon     as these lower schools are dissolved private schools will be opened and much used.

   12,000,000 marks to nearly 18,000,000. In addition to this must 
be reckoned the very extensive grants of the towns for their higher 
schools. 
The position of the German higher schools as regards the public, 
notwithstanding their rapid development, is somewhat unpleasant. 
After many years had been zealously occupied in the inner perfecting 
of the schools, and much progress had been made with the organiza- 
tion of school life, the technic of teaching, the cooperation of the 
teachers, the discipline (and this in the humane direction), hygiene, 
fairness in judging the young, and the improvement of means of 
recreation, an opinion began to gain ground that there was almost 
nothing good in these higher establishments. The claims upon the 
pupils had, people said, become stricter and stricter (as a matter of 
fact the opposite is the case); their time and strength were taken up 
in cramming, memorizing, and repeating thousands of unnecessary 
and useless things; individuality had no show among the many, and 
no rights; and a deep state of depression was produced among the 
young, the horror-exciting evidence of which was the not infrequent 
suicides.of school children. This last disturbing feature, however, is 
proved by statistics to be not commoner among the pupils of the 
higher schools than among other classes of humanity of the same age 
nowadays; and much more general causes belonging to the times, 
modern life, and home education, work together to produce it. 
The public, or at least the enthusiastic and unreflecting public, 
now demand that the young should be allowed to develop themselves, 
to live their lives out as much as possible unhindered; that one 
should regard each individual aptitude as legitimate and valuable; 
that one should not rob the young of their happiest days, either by 
hard home lessons, examinations, or anything else; that all learning 
should be turned as far as possible into play, and the actual play made 
at least an equally important part of the education. But all this 
and much more of the same sort has been heard in the past, and 
similar ideas are not wanting at present in France and elsewhere. 
It is in Germany, however, that these assertions are most passionately 
and confidently made, clearly as a reaction from the tightly inter- 
woven organization of the school system, but they are none the less 
xaggerated, distorted, and unjustifiable on that account. Then 
ain a special movement is on foot for the allotment to art of an és- 
ential place in the education course. It is hoped thus to create an 
vigorating and elevating influence, which is scarcely any longer 
xpected from the religious and ethical side. The attainment of 
eater depth in this latter respect is the evangel of Dr. Friedrich 
ilhelm Férster, at present in Zurich, an educator who has become 
idely known during the last few years. The writings published by . 
im with this object, for example, ‘“Jugendlehre,” have certainly   
 
-P-A-G-E-606
  586 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
enjoyed an extraordinary circulation and, it is to be hoped, will 
prove effective. The question of religion and the higher school is, 
unfortunately, immensely more difficult than in England and 
America.* 
Germany, by the way, is not at all above adopting some of America’s 
valuable reforms in pedagogy. At the same time it will not be found 
easy to go quite so far with the organization of self-government by 
the pupils as has been partly accomplished there; but the ex- 
periment with similar arrangements has nevertheless already been 
made at a number of schools (for example, in Frankfort on the Main, 
and on the lower Rhine), and a continuance of the movement is 
hoped for. The freedom of choice in subjects allowed to the American 
pupil is as little liked in Germany as in France, at least in the earlier 
- classes; but that a certain amount of choice ought to be gradually 
allowed to the scholars of the upper classes, those between 16 and 18 
years, has been already well recognized, and experiments to carry 
it into practice have been made. As is well known, caution in under- 
taking new steps is a fundamental principle of German school ad- 
ministration, and existing institutions are so tightly interlocked with 
one another that reforms are more difficult to introduce than else- 
where. It must at the same time be added that the range of view 
of the teachers in the higher schools is filled much more with details 
of method, the particular lessons, and the firm organization of school 
life than with the more general or deeper questions of the education 
of humanity. It is indeed in urging their greater attention to this 
side of the question that the present writer, in his quality as teacher 
at the University of Berlin and writer on pedagogy, sees his mission. 
Coeducation has had no success in Germany at all corresponding to 
recent wishes. The doubts of its value, which have by some been 
recently expressed in America, have had the upper hand here from 
the very beginning. It is indeed no longer impossible for girls to 
attend boys’ higher schools, but this is allowed only under special 
and exceptional circumstances. On the other hand, a new arrange- 
ment of the entire system of education for girls was made a few years 
ago, chiefly in Prussia, which opens up all sorts of fair possibilities to 
them, shapes their course in many ways after more modern and kindly 
principles than exist in the boys’ schools, and gives, particularly to 
thdse women who have no ambition either for higher academi 
studies or to become teachers, a solid training, by initiating the 
into those high domains in which women’s life and rule find highl 
significant exercise, such as social service, the cultivation of th 
beautiful, and a many-sided understanding of the human soul.

The new organization of higher education for women in Prussia 
has now been carried out in such a way that, out of 426 girls’ higher 
schools, 92 have training seminaries for teachers connected with 
them, and 63 (partially the same) the department called ‘‘ Women’s 
school.’”’ In Leipzig a plan has recently been formed to create a 
special ‘‘High school for women” as a pedagogical and social train- 
ing establishment of the highest class. ° 
Many other new forms of organization have been carried out in the 
sphere of the higher schools. The ‘‘reform schools,’”’ in which Latin 
is begun at 12 years instead of at 9, while French or English takes its 
place at the earlier age, are increasing every year. In Prussia they 
number 130. As they have still, however, to attain the same end as 
the gymnasien and realgymnasien of the older style, they are not 
without their troubles. They are regarded with favor by the public, 
since people want to save the young all avoidable overstrain, and find 
Latin too hard for the earlier years. To meet the need of relief also 
the lessons are being shortened more and more, the intervals between 
them lengthened, and the afternoon classes everywhere are gradually 
being abolished; at any rate, those in scientific subjects. More 
attention is paid in many ways to hygienic considerations—for exam- 
ple, in the provision of new school seats. The interest in games and 
athletics has very much increased; rowing clubs, for instance, exist 
almost universally where a river or lake makes the exercise possible. 
There is, nevertheless, no inclination to abandon the systematic 
German gymnastics for the freer athletic exercises, however uncon- 
genial the former may be to certain other nations. 
The introduction of manual training into the curricula of the higher 
schools has continued, and the work is now established in about 40 
higher schools for boys in Prussia, with as many more desiring it. 
Modeling for the youngest classes has been introduced, at least in some 
schools; drawing has been taught with quite other aims and objects 
during the past decade than formerly; and in natural science, labora- 
tory work is increasing. No single subject of the school course but 
has its problems, has aroused conflict of opinion, and is the object of 
earnest experimenting. Perhaps most difficult of all are the demands 
for provisions for religious instruction which will in the noblest way 
cultivate the feelings without injustice to the scientific knowledge of 
to-day. Further demands are made for the inclusion and develop- 
ent of a preparatory course in philosophy fitted to the school hours 
nd work; for granting to biology a central position and more space 
n the curriculum (demanded by the naturalists); and, lastly (as is 
igorously demanded from other quarters as a main subject), for the     
    
          1 Of school clubs for the purpose of physical exercise (rowing and swimming, rambling, athletics), 776 are 
iow to be found in the higher schools of Prussia, besides 559 for definite scientific, esthetic, and technical 
uurposes. These clubs, which are divided among 550 schools, possess a membership of about 32,000, drawn, 
f course, only from the upper classes. Only a quarter of the schools are without clubs.

institution of a thorough grounding in citizenship in order to as far as 
possible develop a genuine civic sense. 
Rather original is the claim for special schools, or at least special 
classes, for particularly gifted pupils, just as auxiliary schools and 
classes have for some time past existed for those of insufficient powers. 
This claim—at first made in one quarter, but since more widespread— 
is founded on the fact that the more talented pupils, so long as they 
remain among the average members of the class, can not reach their 
highest possible development and sometimes even degenerate. It is 
to the interest of the nation to train to their part in life those natures 
which are meant for intellectual leaders, if only on account of the 
ever-increasing international competition. The demand has, how- 
ever, won no ground as yet in actual practice; the opposing peda- 
gogical scruples are not slight. On the other hand, the movement 
for new educational institutions is on the increase and the ‘‘country 
school homes” (Landerziehungsheime), which approach their English 
model at Abbotsholme, or similar institutions, are gladly taken 
advantage of. The number of city parents who recognize how unfay- 
orable the city environment or the home atmosphere is for the educa- 
tion of their children, or who are themselves actually incapable, has 
become very large. Even the Prussian Government is making 
experiments in this direction. The Arndt Gymnasium at Dahlem, 
in the neighborhood of Berlin, and the century-old Joachimsthalische 
Gymnasium, now in Wilmersdorf-Berlin but shortly to be removed 
into the country, are examples. 
In addition to the not very numerous old foundations (Stiftungen), 
fairly many ‘‘Alumnate” have been created in connection with higher 
schools—i. e., homes officially countenanced and patronized, under 
the conduct of a trustworthy uppermaster and cultured housekeeper, 
in which children from a distance are offered a kind of family life as 
well as furtherance of their studies. These ‘‘Alumnate” are dis- 
tributed over all the Prussian Provinces and already number between 
50 and 60. 
“Forest schools” for weakly children of the people’s schools having 
existed in different parts of Germany for some time past, the town of 
Charlottenburg has now erected the first school of this kind for 
children of the higher schools. Here, in the first year, about 100 
children, boys and girls, were taught together according to the curri- 
culum of the three lower classes. 
Germans can not, at any rate, be accused of stagnation, though the 
mobility of German education perhaps seems comparatively slight to 
those who are accustomed to much freer studies and a looser frame 
work in their own country. But surely it is one of the best recog. 
nized principles in the educational world of to-day to keep the eye 
wide open to the movements which go on in other lands and so pr 
vent self-complacency and torpor at home.

AMERIKA INSTITUT. 
The Amerika Institut, which occupies rooms in the Royal Library 
building at Berlin, was formally organized in October, 1910, with Dr. 
Hugo Minsterberg, of Harvard University, as its first director, acting 
in an honorary capacity during the year of his exchange professorship 
at the University of Berlin. ‘The institut is a foundation of the 
German Government, and its financial support comes chiefly from 
the banking house of Koppel, in Berlin, and from Mr. James Speyer, 
of New York. The office is indebted to Dr. Minsterberg for the 
following information concerning the purpose and scope of this 
organization: 
The general aim of the institut is the systematic furthering of the 
cultural relations between Germany and the United States. Strictly 
political and commercial affairs lie outside of its realm, but everything 
which refers to education and scholarship, to literature and art, 
to technique and social welfare, to travel and public interests, to 
peace and international understanding, will be the fit object of its 
efforts. While the political relations of the countries have always 
been organized, the cultural connections have been the results of 
chance influences which have brought about a wasteful scattering of 
energies, and often a disappointing and even harmful outcome. The 
institut is the first effort to organize and forward these mutual 
interests of two great nations. It is hoped that the enterprise may 
lead to the founding of similar governmental institutions for cul- 
tural relations to foreign countries among all the leading nations of 
the world. 
In confining the work to Germany and America, the institut 
will aid Americans who seek contact with German institutions and 
scholars, libraries and archives, laboratories and museums, hospitals 
and academies, industrial establishments and municipal works, and 
in a corresponding way Germans who need connections with American

institutions or personalities. It will endeavor to further international 
congresses and researches, exhibitions and expeditions, statistical 
inquiries and historical investigations, and to increase the circulation 
of American books in Germany and of German books in America. 
The whole exchange between the Smithsonian Institution in Wash- 
ington and its correspondents in Germany, the transmission of official 
documents and the arrangements for copyrights will be undertaken 
by the institut, which will also have its own extensive American 
library. The officers of the institut will systematically encourage 
the translation of American books into German and of German books 
into English. An important part of its functions will be furnishing in- 
formation to institutions; for instance, in the interest of the American 
students it will advise the German universities concerning the relative 
value of the degrees of the 600 American colleges. In short, the 
services of the institut will include everything which removes possible 
misunderstandings and promotes the cultural friendship, which indi- 
rectly may also work toward harmonious political and commercial 
relations. : 
The staff comprises at present, ‘besides the director, scientific 
workers, librarians, translators, and American and German secre- 
taries. 
     
                   
      
                                       CARNEGIE ENDOWMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL PEACE. 
A noteworthy nonacademic movement for general education is 
a part of the work of the Carnegie Endowment for International 
Peace. Its division of intercourse and education, coordinate with 
the divisions of international law, and of economics and history, has 
set for itself a task authoritatively described by President Nicholas 
Murray Butler, of Columbia University, a member of the board of 
trustees, as follows: 
It will be the function of this division to supplement the work of the two divisions, 
which may be called, perhaps, the scientific ones, by carrying forward vigorously, 
and in cooperation with existing agencies, the educational work of propaganda, of 
international hospitality, and of promoting international friendship. It will be the 
purpose of this division to diffuse information and to educate public opinion regarding 
the causes, nature, and effects of war, and the means for its prevention and avoidance; 
to establish a better understanding of international rights and duties and a more 
perfect sense of international justice among the inhabitants of civilized nations; 
cultivate friendly feelings between the inhabitants of different countries, and increase 
the knowledge and understanding of each other of the several nations; to promote 
a general acceptance of peaceable methods in the settlement of international disputes; 
and to maintain, promote, and assist such establishments, organizations, associations, 
and agencies as shall be deemed necessary or useful in the accomplishment of the 
purposes for which the endowment exists. In other words, this division will make 
practical application of the teachings and findings of the divisions of international 
law and of economics and history. -

EVENTS OF INTERNATIONAL INTEREST. ¢ 593 
CELEBRATION OF THE ONE-HUNDREDTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUN- 
DATION OF THE UNIVERSITY OF BERLIN. 
By Rupotr Tomso, Jr., 
Assistant Professor of the Germanic Languages and Literatures in Columbia University. 
It is exactly 25 years ago that the University of Heidelberg 
celebrated the five-hundredth anniversary of its foundation, and a 
similar event was celebrated by the University of Leipzig only two 
yearsago. Compared with these venerable institutions the University 
of Berlin seems a mere infant, and yet in the century of its existence 
it has forged to the front with giant strides, and to-day occupies the 
foremost position among the score of famous German seats of higher 
learning. Only two German universities, viz, Bonn, established in 
1818, and Munich, founded in 1826, are younger than Berlin, and yet 
the Royal Frederick William University, as it is named in honor of 
its founder, King Frederick William III of Prussia, has, in a com- 
paratively brief period of time, outstripped all of its rivals, not only 
in point of size of faculty and student body and in the number and 
diversity of its institutes, but also in the depth and range of its 
influence. Established in an era of political storm and stress, when 
the heterogeneous and disjointed mass of German states and prin- 
cipalities lay in humble subjection at Napoleon’s feet, it furnished 
eloquent testimony of the inability of the ruthless conqueror to crush 
that love of learning and the desire to discover ultimate principles 
and great truths which had been marked characteristics of German 
scholarship for centuries. In spite of opposition on the part of the 
near-by University of Frankfort (on the Oder) and of certain quarters 
of the Berlin Academy of Science, a series of lectures was inaugurated 
in the winter of 1809, which was followed by the formal opening of 
the institution in 1810 with an enrollment of 256 students and a 
teaching staff of 58. To-day the university has over 10,000 students 
and more than twice as many instructors as there were then students. 
From its very inception the university attracted some of the foremost 
scholars of the land, who aided mightily in winning prestige for the 
new institution; the number of these has increased constantly, but 
since the rehabilitation of the German Empire and the establishment 
of Berlin as its political and social center, the marvelous growth of 
the city and the unqualified advantages it offers to men of letters 
and of science and to those in search of knowledge have combined to 
produce a progress that has proceeded by leaps and bounds. The 
University of Berlin to-day is stamping its impress not only upon the 
municipality, toward the solution of whose problems it is furnishing 
constant aid, nor merely upon the country at large; its radius of 
influence reaches out much farther in all directions, for there is no

   594 oo EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
civilized corner of the globe which has not been, or is not, represented 
among its student body. Berlin, in fact, attracts more foreigners 
than any other German university, and the tide of American student 
immigration, which turned from Géttingen to Leipzig some years ago, 
is now flowing into the Kaiser’s capital. There is another reason why 
American educators should take a special interest in Berlin, and this 
is found in the fact that the university welcomes two American men 
of learning to its halls annually, the Harvard exchange and the 
Theodore Roosevelt professors, not the least important of whose 
missions is to promote a spirit of intellectual good will and mutual 
understanding between two great sister nations. 
Especial interest therefore attaches to the celebration of the one- 
hundredth anniversary of the foundation of the University of Berlin, 
which took place October 10-12, 1910, in the presence of a most 
distinguished company of scholars from all parts of the world, 
representing over a hundred German and foreign institutions of 
higher learning and almost a score of academies, including the 
American Philosophical Society and the Smithsonian Institution; 
from England they came and from Russia, from Greece and from 
Turkey, from China and from Japan, from the United States and 
from Canada, from Australia and from South Africa, and from a score 
of other lands. The reception to the foreign delegates and guests of 
honor took place in the rooms of the university at 8 o’clock on the 
evening of October 10, after an impressive festival service had been 
held in the Cathedral, at which the sermon was preached by Prof. 
Kaftan, the dean of the faculty of theology. A torchlight procession 
arranged by the student body took place the same evening, probably 
the most imposing ever witnessed in the German capital. Over 3,000 
students and numerous alumni marched through the Tiergarten and 
down Unter den Linden, then assembled in front of the brilliantly 
illuminated main building of the university, where‘a committee 
presented the congratulations of the student body to the rector, the 
students having joined previously in the academic song of songs— 
Gaudeamus Igitur. 
The climax of the festivities was reached in the first Festakt, on 
the morning of October 11. This, like the second formal ceremony 
on the following day, was held in the new Aula, which the minister of| 
public instruction dedicated as the jubilee gift of the Prussian Gov- 
ernment. The new assembly hall of the university is located in th 
old Royal Library, the entire building having been remodeled i 
the interior, and it furnished an unwontedly festive appearance in it: 
new garb. The hall was filled with a representative assemblage whe: 
the rector of the university, Prof. Erich Schmidt, entered with thi 
deans of the four faculties. These academic dignitaries were followe

by the Emperor and Empress, Princess Victoria Louise, and Prince 
Ruprecht of Bavaria, who were assigned to seats in the front of the 
hall, while the representatives of the student societies saluted and 
lowered their flags. 
At the conclusion of the opening remarks by the rector the Emperor 
ascended the rostrum and read his congratulatory address in loud 
and clear tones. Of special interest was the announcement of the 
gift of a fund of about 10,000,000 marks, which had been collected 
by His Majesty for the purpose of founding and maintaining a series 
of research institutes in the city of Berlin, the preliminary plans for 
which had been outlined by Prof. Adolf Harnack and Geheimrat 
Friedrich Schmidt, of the ministry of public instruction. The project 
itself is an old one, going back to the days of Director Friedrich 
Althoff, but the first definite steps were taken at the instigation of 
the Emperor himself. The institutes are to be managed by a society 
for the promotion of science in Berlin; this society has since been 
organized, and arrangements have been made for the establishment 
of a chemical institute, to which Prof. Ernst Bechmann, of the 
University of Leipzig, and Prof. Fritz Haber, of the Technological 
School of Karlsruhe, have been called. 
The Emperor was followed by the minister of public instruction, 
Von Trott zu Solz, and later by the chief burgomaster, Martin 
Kirschner, who referred to the fact that honorary citizenship had 
been conferred by the city of Berlin upon five members of the faculty 
of the university, viz, Alexander von Humboldt, August Boeckh, 
Leopold von Ranke, Robert Koch, and Rudolf Virchow, and in the 
name of the city presented to the university a fund of 200,000 marks 
for the establishment of a series of traveling stipends of at least 1,500 
marks in value. 
. The opening speeches were followed by the presentation of con- 
gratulatory addresses by the representatives of institutions of higher 
learning and learned societies from all sections of the world, the 
representatives of each nation or group of nations having previously 
selected a spokesman, who addressed the rector, while the other - 
delegates filed by and deposited their scrolls or parchments, which in 
many instances were beautifully illuminated. Marked applause was 
given to Prof. Poincaré, of the University of Paris, who was one of the 
two spokesmen of the Romance group, the other being Prof. Brugi, of 
the University of Padua. England, with her colonies, was represented 
by Lord Strathcona, and President Arthur T. Hadley, of Yale, 
epresented the American universities. In his response the rector 
eferred to the close intellectual ties uniting Germany and the United 
tates and read a passage from President Wheeler’s letter of regret: 
‘You are still my rector and I feel my loyalty reaching out instinc-

          tively to your support; and I feel Berlin still my university, for I 
can never lose out of my life the memory of the kindness of last 
winter’s welcome.” At the conclusion of the exercises the audience 
rose and all, including His Majesty, joined heartily in a stirring 
Gaudeamus Igitur. 
In addition to the endowments mentioned above announcement 
was made by the prorector of the following gifts: A minimum of 
100,000 marks to the student body of the university; 150,000 marks 
for the establishment of a chair of colonial geography; by the Philo- 
sophical Society of Berlin, the proceeds of a collection for a Fichte 
monument; by the Legal Society, funds for the erection of a Savigny 
monument; and by the holders of the Berlin doctorate, 18,000 marks 
toward a student-aid fund. Various gifts were also received from 
the merchants of Berlin and a number of Leipzig publishing houses. 
The ceremony in the Aula was followed by a dinner in the large 
“White Hall” of the Landesausstellungs Park. 
. In the evening a festival performance of Mozart’s ‘Die Hochzeit 
des Figaro,’ with Richard Strauss conducting, was given in the 
Royal Schauspielhaus, as the Royal Opera House was undergoing 
extensive alterations at the time. . 
The second Festakt took place in the new Aula on the morning of 
October 12. The exercises began with the delivery of an historical 
sketch of the university by its historian, Max Lenz, forming a 
synopsis, as it were, of his monumental four-volume history of the 
institution, which had just appeared. Of greater interest to the for- 
eign delegates, however, was the awarding of the honorary degrees, 
the first person to be honored with the degree of doctor of laws being 
His Majesty the Emperor. Among the Americans receiving honor- 
ary degrees were Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, of the United States 
Supreme Court; Prof. John William Burgess, of Columbia University, 
who received the degree of doctor of laws; Prof. Theodore William 
Richards, of Harvard University, doctor of medicine honoris causa; 
President Arthur T. Hadley, of Yale University, and President 
Abbott Lawrence Lowell, of Harvard University, doctor of philosophy 
honoris causa. 
The afternoon of October 12 was given over to a student garden 
festival in the Landesausstellungs Park, which was filled to the gates 
with a happy and noisy throng. The festival proper partook of the 
nature of a country fair, living pictures illustrating student lif 
between 1600 and 1810, etc., the keynote of the affair, so far as th 
student actors were concerned, being a reproduction of the academi 
costumes and customs of the year 1810. The Kommers, which close 
the official celebration, took place in the evening in the large exhi 
bition halls at the Zoological Gardens, no less than 8,000 student:

and alumni participating and joining in the singing of student songs 
accompanied by a splendid military band. 
On the following evening a number of foreign visitors, together 
with several ‘prominent members of the faculty as well as several 
student representatives, were invited by the Emperor to a gala 
dinner in the palace. 
In view of the commanding influence of Germany in the world of 
science and intellect the visiting delegates were deeply impressed by 
the note of universality that was struck again and again in the 
course of these elaborate and imposing ceremonies.

FIFTH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS FOR THE AMELIORATION OF THE 
LOT OF THE BLIND. EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
HELD AT CAIRO, EGYPT, FEBRUARY 2 TO 25, 1911. 
REPORT BY MISS ETTA JOSSELYN GIFFIN, ACCREDITED AS A NATIONAL 
DELEGATE TO THE CONGRESS.* 
In pursuance of instructions I proceeded to Cairo as a national 
delegate, also representing the Library of Congress, presented my 
credentials, and was cordially welcomed and given numerous oppor- 
tunities to improve the great advantages offered to the ‘“congres- 
sionists” for the study of the work in behalf of the blind. 
Representatives from 10 nations of the Old and the New World 
were in attendance,-_many of whom were celebrated oculists and well- 
known specialists in the care and treatment of the blind. The debates 
were thoroughly practical and were accompanied by many useful 
illustrations. 
February 20 the congress was formally opened at 10.30 a. m., in 
the Khedivial Opera House, under the patronage of His Highness the 
Khedive, Abbas II, in the presence of the cabinet ministers, the 
diplomatic agents of the powers, and a great number of high officials 
and notables. 
Prince Ahmed Pasha Fouad, uncle of the Khedive, who was dele- 
gated by him to preside at the ceremony, was accompanied by the- 
prime minister and members of the cabinet. He delivered an eloquent 
speech of welcome to the official delegates and members, and in the 
name of His Highness Abbas II, Khedive of Egypt, declared the 
congress open. 
His Excellency Hussein Pasha Roushdi, minister of foreign affairs, 
made an interesting address in which he expressed Egypt’s gratitude 
to the countries that sent delegates to the congress, and greeted the 
men and women who responded to the invitation of the Government. 
He said that although Egypt is still far from equal to certain European 
‘countries in the development of institutions for improving the con- 
ditions of the blind, it has the will to achieve this end, and the solici- 
tude shown by the Government in organizing the congress and found-. 
ing hospitals for combating eye diseases is sufficient proof thas it 
will succeed and will attain a worthy position among philanthropic 
nations. 
The procureur general Abdel Khalek Pasha Sarwat made a speech 
in Arabic in which, after paying a warm tribute to the Khedive, he 
lauded the merits of the philanthropic congress.

He was followed by Abbe Rohat, one of the delegates from France, 
and by Miss Etta Josselyn Giffin, one of the delegates from the United 
States of America, who in brief speeches conveyed the greetings of 
their respective Governments, and the educators, specialists, and the 
blind in their countries to the Khedive, his Government and the “con- 
gressionists.”’ 
The object of the congress and its official program were set forth by 
Dr. Eloui Pasha, one of the chief promoters of the congress. 
The subsequent meetings of the congress were held at the Egyptian 
University. His Excellency Abbate Pasha, now in his ninety-first 
year, presided at the first session, and recalled the Ophthalmic Con- 
gress which met in 1862 when he was delegate of the Egyptian Gov- 
ernment, at which time the first landmarks were placed toward the 
amelioration of the lot of the blind. He spoke of the unhappy efforts 
of the first school for the blind, founded 30 years ago by Orissi Bey. 
The school unfortunately succumbed through lack of resources. The 
contrast is great between the first effort and the excellent school now 
prospering at Zeitoun, which was founded in 1901 through the gener- 
osity of the late Mrs. '’. R. Armitage, of London. 
The proceedings were arranged under several heads or subjects, 
viz: 
First question.—What definition shall be given to cecity, and what 
is the degree of sight below which an individual may be considered 
blind ? 
In the discussion of this question the congress listened successively 
to Rev. Amadeus Stockmans, president general of the Brothers of 
Charity, Belgium; Dr. Louis Dor, Lyons, ‘France; Dr. Mohamed 
Tahir Bey, Cairo; and Luigi Salina. So many members treated this 
subject exhaustively that the discussion engrossed the entire session. 
Second question.—What are the best measures to adopt to avoid 
the spread of the forms of ophthalmia which may lead to blindness ? 
Carefully prepared papers were read by Dr. Eloui Pasha, secretary 
general of the permanent committee of Cairo, who made the suggestion 
that the treatment of ophthalmia be obligatory, and the operations 
recognized as necessary be made compulsory, as is vaccination. This 
was so radical that no immediate action could be taken. 
Dr. A. F. MacCallan, chief ophthalmic inspector of public health, 
Cairo, gave a detailed account of the good work that is already being 
done and outlined a plan for further organized work for the cure and 
prevention of blindness. 
M. Jules Van den Heuval, minister of justice, Belgium, urged the 
necessity of aiding the blind in Egypt, not alone with words and good 
intentions but in a financial way and with the united effort of all. 
He exhorted the wealthy Egyptians to give their charity to the work 
of caring for the blind, and also asked the tourists to bestow some of  
-P-A-G-E-620
  600 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
that gold, so useful in seeing the beauties of Egypt, on the same good 
-work. He recommended to the people of all nations the advantage 
of instructing young women in the care of their children’s eyes, that 
being the first step toward prevention of disease, and he made a strong 
appeal to the religious bodies, exhorting them to preach hygienic 
principles and to impose them on their people. 
His Excellency Dr. Comanos Pasha, of Athens, added: 
Minister Van den Heuval has most wisely said that the priests should advise women 
at the time of their marriage to give the most scientific care to their children. I wish to 
add my voice to his in persuading our colleagues in this congress who belong to the Mus- 
sulman faith to join us in endeavoring to convince the imans and the sheiks of Islam 
of the necessity, in the interest of their country, of preaching plainly in the mosques 
and in the school of Cadiz the dogmas of their religion concerning hygiene, because 
there is no religion in the world in which hygiene and the care of the sick are more 
highly prized than in the Mussulman. This expedient which I propose is a powerful 
one and would be of enormous value in the prevention of the blindness so prevalent in 
this country. 
The proposal was applauded and carried immediately. 
Third question.—Has the adoption of Esperanto as the universal 
language for the blind been applied, and in the affirmative case, what 
are the practical results it has produced ? 
Interesting papers in favor of teaching Esperanto to the blind were 
read by Prof. Dor, of Lyon, and Brother Isadore Clé, of Woluve St. 
Lambert, Brussels. Miss Giffin said in America Esperanto is con- 
sidered a recreation rather than a practical aid to the blind. It 
broadens the horizon, through correspondence in Esperanto with 
people of different nations, and is therefore greatly enjoyed. 
Fourth question.—Stenography being useful to the blind, what is 
the preferable method, applicable to all languages, for them to learn? 
Brother Isadore Clé spoke in favor of stenography for the blind, and 
Miss Giffin told of the successful use of stenography by the blind of 
England, who become expert enough to have offices at the railway 
stations where business men can dictate letters before going to the 
city, and upon their return receive the correctly typewritten letters. 
This practice is also growing in America. 
Fifth question.—What are the best professions and trades to enable 
the blind to earn their living ? 
Rev. Amadeus Stockmans suggested music in many forms, i. e., 
organists in churches, teachers of musical instruments, artist musi- 
cians for concerts and soirées, and composers; also teachers of 
languages. The following trades and occupations were mentioned in 
the discussion: Making brooms and mattresses, manufacturing 
chairs, sofas, tea tables, baskets, etc., of willow and rattan; weaving 
portiéres, draperies, curtains, sofa-pillow covers, rugs, and carpets; 
shoe making and mending; cigar making; knitting and crochet; and 
sewing by machine and by hand. Massage is taught very thoroughly

     in London and positions secured for graduates in numerous hospitals 
or as hydropathists. In Japan massage is one of the principal occu- 
pations of the blind. 
Sizth question.—What are the best games and physical exercises to 
introduce in schools for the blind ? 
Brother Isadore Clé read a paper on the necessity for outdoor 
games that will develop the muscles and lungs. Through these 
exercises the brain will be strengthened. Indoor games, for inclem- 
ent weather, were numerous, only a few of them being mentioned 
here, i. e., dominos, cards, game of authors, hide and seek (game of 
Shakesperean characters), chess and checkers, alphabet cards for 
word building, parcheesi, billiards, dancing, roller skating, swimming, 
puss in the corner, blind man’s buff, ete. 
The delegate from the United States told about the meeting of the 
Inter-Blind School: Athletic Association at the Pennsylvania school 
at Overbrook, where teams from the schools for the blind at Boston, 
Batavia, Pittsburgh, and Overbrook competed in running and swim- 
ming races, the broad and high jump, throwing the hammer and 
putting the shot, exercises on the trapeze, vaulting poles and horse, 
and in tumbling, wrestling, etc. The Baltimore and Overbrook 
schools for the blind have closely contested football games which are 
as greatly enjoyed as those of Harvard and Yale Universities. 
Seventh question.—Is it advisable to make any modifications in the 
Braille system now in general use through Europe and the Orient ? 
Brother Isadore Clé explained the excellence of the Braille system, 
which is systematically arranged and is easy to read and write. The 
sense of the congress was that the alphabet should remain intact, as 
any changes would prevent the unity of writing by the blind in all 
countries. Attention was called to the fact that the nations are 
trying to adopt one system (Roman letter) for the seeing people, i: e., 
the Germans are permitting the use of both kinds of type and both 
kinds of script, and the Russians and Japanese are considering a 
similar move in the near future. 
Eighth question.—May not the blind replace the seeing in telephone 
and telegraph bureaus ? 
Rey. Amadeus Stockmans voiced the opinion of the congress by 
saying it was impractical for the blind to replace those with sight in 
uch positions. In the discussion, mention was made of successful 
perators in New York City and several English cities. 
During this session Ahmed Bey Zaki, the secretary of the council of 
inisters, made an interesting address and showed a specimen of an 
phabet in raised Arabic characters, by which blind Arabs read. 
e said: 
This method of writing and reading has been employed by Arabs for six centuries. 
e say that it is to a son of the Orient that the honor is due for having conceived and 
 
-P-A-G-E-622
  602 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
executed a raised alphabet for the blind. This celebrated blind man, the forerunner 
of Braille, was Aly Ben Ahmed El Amidi, naive of Mesopotamia. Being very intel- 
ligent, he gave himself up to science and left to posterity some astonishingly well- 
composed works. He was a professor at the Moustanarieh University, founded orig- 
inally at Bagdad. He was an accomplished linguist, speaking fluently Mongolian, 
Turkish, Persian, and Greek. 
_ To prevent the raised characters from flattening he was careful to stick on the same 
page a card of the same thickness, thanks to which the letters were entirely preserved. 
The good fortune of the propagation and spread of the system of Al-Amidi is due to 
Louis Braille, the immortal blind Frenchman, whose glory will certainly not be 
lessened because he had in Al-Amidi an Arabic forerunner. 
      
   
    
    
        
   
   
                          
    
    
    
   
     In conclusion, Zaki Bey proposed that the last session of the Fifth 
International Congress for the Amelioration of the Lot of the Blind, 
gathered on the:banks of the Nile, under the auspices of His Highness 
the Khedive, Abbas II, be considered a féte of the sixth centenary of 
Al-Amidi, the veritable inventor of embosséd writing for the blind. 
At the close of the session a copy of the Biographical Dictionary of 
the Blind was presented to each delegate and member of the congress 
by Zaki Bey. 
M. Amine Bozari, a blind musician, presented a paper urging the 
establishment of a school for teaching the blind to play the flute and 
the oud (oriental mandolin). Another blind man, N. Sabh Antoum, 
exhibited a device for writing in straight lines by the blind. Mr. 
Walter C. Holmes exhibited a typewriter which can be easily used by 
the blind. Mention was made by Miss Giffin of the State commis- 
sions and associations for the prevention of blindness, which are most 
useful in educating the public by illustrated lectures and literature 
on this important subject in the United State of America. M. Van 
den Heuval, president of the congress, proposed the organization of 
an international bureau of information, with the object of bringing 
nearer and putting into closer relation the schools and institutions for 
the blind and to make public the progressive methods employed by 
each. This proposition was immediately accepted. 
Rey. Amadeus Stockmans then congratulated all his colleagues on 
their united efforts. He regretted that the short period of the con-| 
gress had made it impossible to go deeply into many important ques- 
tions. In conclusion he thanked the “congressionists’’ for the work 
executed in common. 
In conclusion I would state that the curse of Egypt is blindness, one 
of the most fruitful causes of which is the innumerable flies, which are 
never brushed from the eyes of babies, and are allowed to die in the} 
eye. In former times, it is said, the mothers, to prevent conscription 
into the army, would pierce one of the eyes of their boy children, 
Under the present régime they may enlist for a term of years, afte’ 
which time they can return to their homes, so the practice of blindin; 
one eye is decreasing. There is also a superstition about childre: 
 
-P-A-G-E-623
   EVENTS OF INTERNATIONAL INTEREST. 603 
being admired by strangers, and the mother often injures one eye 
of the child to prevent the Evil Spirit from wanting him. 
The census of 1907 gives 148,280 blind of both sexes, but it is 
stated that the number should probably be doubled. There are 
39,000 blind children, and the work of prevention of blindness is 
greatly needed. 
Under the excellent supervision and direction of Dr. MacCallan, 
chief ophthalmic inspector, public health, splendid work is being done 
through traveling hospitals which sail up the Nile in picturesque 
dahabeahs, camping along the route in tents pitched beneath the 
feathery palms. The Arab seems to prefer being treated by oculists 
and surgeons who employ primitive modes of travel and domicile 
rather than going to the best equipped hospitals. 
At the close of the opening ceremony at the Khedivial Opera House 
the ‘“congressionists”’ were escorted to Zeitoun for a visit to the insti- 
tution for the blind, and were escorted through the buildings and 
palm garden where the pupils were engaged in various lessons and 
occupations. The Institution for the Blind, Zeitoun, Cairo, was 
founded in 1901 through the generosity of the late Mrs. T. R. Armitage. 
of London, whose son and daughter continued to maintain it during 
its earlier years. In October, 1905, the institution passed under the 
control of a representative committee in Cairo, of which Mr. Arthur 
D. Alban, H. B. M. consul, is chairman. The institution is non- 
sectarian and has received valuable help from His Highness the 
Khedive and Lord Cromer (while resident in Egypt). Its usefulness 
is recognized by the Egyptian Government, the Administration of 
Moslem Wakfs, and the Orthodox Coptic Patriarchate, each of which 
has granted an annual contribution towards its support. 
Blind boys of any religious persuasion are received and educated. 
The course of study includes instruction in reading, writing, grammar, 
arithmetic, geography, and history. These are all Arabic studies. 
English is taught, partly as a mental discipline, though it is believed 
that a knowledge of the language will be of use to the boys. The 
English studies include reading, writing, and conversation. Moslems 
are taught to recite the Koran and also receive instruction in the 
principles of their religion. The Copts likewise receive religious 
instruction and are taught to chant the service of the Coptic Orthodox 
Church. This leads to lucrative positions in mosques and churches 
and at weddings and funerals. 
It is the object of the institution to make pupils wholly, or in part, 
self-supporting, and they are taught chair caning as soon as possible 
after their entrance, as it has been found that the sooner the pupils 
can be set at this work the quicker they are to learn to use their hands. 
t teaches them perseverance and method and from the beginning 
leads them to regard their training as a means of self-support. The

trades besides chair caning are basket and chair making and making 
brushes of all kinds and sizes. 
The institution also produces books in Braille character, embossed 
by machinery, and is the only producer of such books for the Arabic- 
speaking blind of Egypt. 
REPORT OF THE SAME CONGRESS BY MR. WALTER G. HOLMES, MANAGER 
OF THE MATILDA ZIEGLER MAGAZINE FOR THE BLIND, ACCREDITED 
AS A NATIONAL DELEGATE TO THE CONGRESS. 
The work of the convention was largely of an informal character, 
and the benefits derived by the visitors from other countries than 
Egypt at this meeting came more from the individual exchange of 
ideas than from the direct work of the meeting itself, for the work of 
the meeting was devoted largely to discussing means for the pre- 
vention and cure of blindness in Egypt, in which country there are 
about 30 times as many blind persons in proportion to population 
as this and other western countries have. 
The great problem in Egypt, therefore, is prevention and cure, 
especially in view of the fact that it is considered in Egypt that any- 
thing more than a limited education of the blind would result in 
more harm than good in educating the blind away from their families 
and, surroundings. 
The farming classes of Egypt live in a most simple way, in mud 
huts without flooring, the chickens, sheep, and other cattle often 
occupying the same rooms with the people. 
The School for the Blind at Zeitoun, a suburb of Cairo, has about 
40 pupils, who are housed and cared for during the school term, 
The effort is made to maintain these children in such a way that 
they will not become dissatisfied after returning to the simple lives 
which they will have to lead in their homes. For instance, the bed 
on which the children sleep is a little wooden platform, raised at 
one end, covered by a strip of Japanese matting. They lie on this, 
having one blanket for covering. At first this seems harsh treat- 
ment, but, everything considered, it may be best for the child and its 
future. It is stated that many a blind child educated at the State 
institutions has been rendered very unhappy on returning to his 
simple rural life after years of comfort and refined surroundings at 
the school. 
A number of causes contribute to the great number of blind in 
Egypt, but the main cause is probably a lack of cleanliness. There 
is a superstition among the mothers that if a child is bathed it will 
die, and their rule is never to bathe a child until it is 2 years old. 
At the meeting educational matters were not so much discussed 
as were the general problems pertaining to the blind, such as what 
employment is best for them in earning a livelihood, games, ete., for

their amusement. It was the sense of the meeting that in those 
countries which use what is known as European or Universal Braille, 
it should not be changed or interfered with, and the meeting decided 
that Esperanto had not progressed far enough as a world language to 
recommend the blind taking it up, except as a pastime and diversion. 
So far as Egypt is concerned the meeting should prove very help- 
ful to the cause of the blind, especially in that it aroused the whole 
country to an interest in the blind. The fact that the meeting was 
under the auspices of His Highness, the Khedive, gave it a promi- 
nence which attracted attention of the entire country, and most of 
the high officials of Egypt participated in the proceedings of the 
meeting. 
The Khedive gave a special reception to the national representa- 
tives attending the congress and, addressing them in French, 
thanked them for the interest they had taken in the matter. As 
the American delegates retired from the room, the Khedive addressed 
them in English, expressing especial gratification that the United 
States had sent representatives to the meeting to advise and help 
them in their great problem of helping their blind. Most of the 
leading countries in the world were represented at the meeting, and 
several of the South American countries sent representatives. 
The resolutions adopted by the congress included the following 
declaration of purposes: 
The committee will endeavor to organize an international bureau, 
with the object of bringing nearer and putting into closer relation the 
schools and institutions for the blind and to make public the pro- 
gressive methods employed by each. 
The bureau will publish a periodical for the interchange of ideas, 
with the concurrence of schools, institutions, and persons interested 
in the welfare of the blind.

    EVENTS OF INTERNATIONAL INTEREST. 607 
INTERNATIONAL HYGIENE EXHIBITION, DRESDEN, 1911. 
An International Hygiene Exhibition was held at Dresden during 
the present year, beginning May 1 and continuing till October 1. 
The object of the exhibition, as set forth in the official announcement, 
was to bring ‘‘before the professional world and the general public 
the acquisitions of modern hygiene in the form of a comprehensive 
and universal exhibition, an ideal which for years had been warmly 
agitated in hygienic circles.” The project assumed definite shape 
at Dresden in 1906, on the occasion of a convention of persons promi- 
nently identified with efforts for the promotion of public health. In 
this convention the motion to hold a hygiene exhibition was unani- 
mously carried, and it was also voted that it should be international; 
the choice of a locality fell upon Dresden. 
The success of the enterprise was assured from the outset. The 
King of Saxony gave it the full weight of his name and influence, and 
eminent officials, among them, the chancellor of the empire, and the 
minister of the interior for Saxony accepted the title of honorary 
president Under these favoring circumstances, liberal responses 
were obtained to the appeal for the financial guaranty of the under- 
taking, the State government and the city of Dresden contributing 
freely and the citizens pledging 1,000,000 marks ($238,000) for the 
fund. The city also offered the free use of a spacious building for the 
exhibition. The entire arrangements were in charge of a strong 
committee under the presidency of K. A. Lingner, privy counselor 
for commercial affairs, Dresden. With him were associated a number 
of men, distinguished as specialists or administrators. An elaborate 
plan for the exhibition was formulated, comprising nine well-defined 
sections or groups, together with five additional special groups, and 
a, historical department. : 
The introduction to the official circular called attention to the 
extraordinary development in hygiene in the quarter of a century 
that has elapsed since the last general hygiene exhibition was organ- 
ized in Germany. 
At that time hygiene was still an infant science for which as yet no chair was provided 
in most universities, a science in modest attire, which was considered by many as 
hardly complete. 
* * * * * * * 
Not only does every university of to-day possess its own hygienic department, but 
also in all eivilized states numerous stations have been established for the science of 
hygiene. Grand discoveries, especially in the province of bacteriology, enable us 
to save thousands and thousands of precious human lives. Technics and industry 
vie with each other in all fields in the application of hygiene to practice. In many 
cases legislation feels compelled to observe in its measures the precepts of hygiene; 
and the social ideas of our century have been led by hygiene into new paths, to those 
imposing movements which aim to increase the pleasure of living and the working 
strength of mankind and to preserve nations from the dissipation of high values. 
Trresistibly, hygiene penetrates all phenomena of human life and its realm expands 
from day to day.
-P-A-G-E-628
  608 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
Because of this development it is impossible for even the specialist 
in hygiene to keep informed as to the total province of the subject, 
and it is, therefore, of great service to him to have brought before him 
“the results and acquisitions of recent investigation displayed as a 
well-ordered, systematic whole, in the form of an exhibition.” 
In the general plan of the exhibit, Group VIII was assigned to 
children and adolescents, arid here school hygiene was brought into 
relation with the entire environment of the young, beginning with 
the earliest stage of infancy and continuing to the conditions affecting 
minors after the school period is closed. It is noticeable that the 
intellectual side of school life was included in this presentation as well 
as the sanitary requirements of school buildings, provision for physical 
training, recreation, etc. 
The thoroughness of the preparation for this important exhibition 
is indicated by the establishment of a ‘‘News Bureau,” from which 
was issued a leaflet entitled Hygieia. One number of this leaflet 
stated that the collection of statistics alone, brought together by the 
German Government for this occasion, cost approximately $70,000. 
According to fragmentary reports of the exhibit, which have 
appeared in the current journals, the original plans were fully carried 
“out and on a magnificent scale. School hygiene was well represented 
both in the general sections and in special national exhibits, All 
divisions of the subject were fully illustrated by models, photographs, 
plans, and exhibits of apparatus. 
-Among features of interest to specialists were the presentations 
relative to humidity in schoolrooms and the problems of fatigue- 
With reference to the former one reporter notes: 
It was shown by numerous diagrams that symptoms of heat collapse and fatigue are 
liable to occur in a room the temperature of which is above 68° F. or the relative humid- 
ity in excess of 50 per cent, although there may be little carbonic acid in the air; 
though, if the temperature and moisture be low, as much as 15 parts per 1,000 of carbon 
dioxide may pass unnoticed. * * * ‘The general conclusion reached is that the 
temperature in a classroom at the beginning of lessons should not exceed 61° F., and 
that at no time should it exceed 67° F.1 
In relation to the effects of fatigue, the work of Lorentz and Weich- 
ardt on the fatigue toxin received prominent notice. From the 
diagrams presented, ‘‘an apparent gain in working capacity appeared 
in classes working in rooms which had been sprayed with the fatigue 
antitoxin.” ? 
It is the purpose of the organizing committee to set forth the total 
results of the exhibition in extensive publications, so that specialists

   CHAPTER XXII. 
REPORT OF THE FIRST UNIVERSAL: RACES CONGRESS, 
HELD AT LONDON JULY 26-29, 1911. 
By Fevrx ADLER, 
Delegate representing the, United States Bureau of Education. 
This congress was held in London from July 26 to July 30, in- 
clusive, of the present year. The object of the congress was, in a 
broad and deep sense, educational. The ends of the earth came to- 
gether for the purpose of considering how the antagonisms and an- 
tipathies that breed hate between different races might be lessened 
and eventually overcome; and this question it was proposed to dis- 
cuss, not on sentimental grounds, but on the basis of science and with 
the help of the experience of practical statesmen and educators. 
The sessions were held in the large hall of London University. 
Lord Weardale was president of the congress, Hon. William Pember 
Reeves, chairman of the executive council, the writer of the present 
article, president of the general committee, and Dr. G. Spiller was the 
organizer and secretary. To his extraordinary administrative capac- 
ity and his remarkable devotion the actual success of the congress 
was largely due. There were 2,100 members—1,200 active and 900 
passive members. Seventeen Governments were officially represented. 
Hindus were present in considerable numbers, such splendid figures 
as that of Principal Brajendranath Seal among them. 
The Maharajah of Baroda presided at one of the meetings. Hadji- 
Mirza Yahyah represented Persia with oriental dignity and charm 
of manner. The Chinese delegate impressed the audiences as one of 
the brainiest and most energetic personalities of the congress. The 
Turkish delegation was conspicuous. The Government of Turkey 
finds itself face to face with problems created by the juxtaposition 
of alien races within the Empire, and hence the Young Turks are 
supremely interested in the very questions on which the congress was 
engaged. Gen. Légitime represented Haiti; Dr. de Lacerda, Brazil. 
The first colored member of the South African Parliament was 
resent, a man of coal-black skin, tall, well built, highly intel-

    ligent, belonging to a tribe that not so long ago were reputed to be 
fiercer than even the Zulus. Many negroes of the United States were 
also present, with Dr. Du Bois at their head. Russia, Germany, 
France, Italy, Spain, Greece were all represented by distinguished 
personalities. It will thus be seen that the congress was not only a 
congress for the races, that is, for their benefit, but a congress of the 
races, and this indeed was one of its characteristic features. The ends 
of the earth were called together to deliberate how one of the greatest 
obstacles to the progress of mankind as a whole might be removed. 
REASONS FOR THE ASSEMBLING OF THE CONGRESS AT THIS TIME. 
Race antipathies have always existed within the borders of occi- 
dental civilization, as, for instance, between the Czechs and Germans, 
the Poles and their neighbors, the Jews and Gentiles; and the diffi- 
culties created by such antagonisms is an ever-present danger within 
the bosom of western civilization. But aside from this constant 
source of difficulty, there are at present two outstanding reasons why 
the problem of inter-racial relations demands attention. One is the 
near approach to one another of the Occident and the Orient, due to 
greatly increased facilities of transportation and communication. 
The other lies in the fact that the nations of Europe and America are 
assuming to an unprecedented extent the responsibility of ruling 
races less advanced than themselves or wholly backward races. In the 
one case there is the danger, not only of war, or of the so-called yel- 
low peril, but also danger that the influx of western civilization may 
undermine the basis upon which the civilizations of the East have 
been built, without supplying any adequate substitute. In the other 
relation of the civilized to the primitive races there is the danger of 
ruthless exploitation (the cruelties attending the rubber trade on the 
Kongo are still fresh in everyone’s memory, and of the virtual en- 
slavement of the subject peoples. 
It should be noted that the spirit in which the congress met was 
not that of oversanguine optimism. The prevailing mood was not 
that of persons believing that mankind is on the homestretch toward 
the millenium. Nor did the illusion prevail in the minds of the 
leaders of the congress that a meeting of this sort or of a few others| 
like it could change enmities into universal amity. It was rathe 
under the heavy pressure of the sense of great and novel perils threat 
ening mankind that the congress met. An entirely new situation ha 
been created by the conditions now existing in the Far East, and b: 
the partition of Africa. How shall this situation be met? What re 
demptive agencies can be set in operation, however gradually, 
modify the forces that make for mutual distrust? Something mus 
be done; something must at least be begun to diminish if not wholl:
-P-A-G-E-631
  
  THE FIRST UNIVERSAL RACES CONGRESS. 611 
to avert the peril. Such reflections as these determined the temper 
by which the deliberations of the delegates were colored. And the 
subjects discussed, the measures considered, were, as under the cir- 
cumstances they could not but be, in the broad sense educational. 
Science, it was generally agreed, might be of great service. The 
majority of anthropologists, for instance, now favor the monogenetic 
theory of the origin of the different races. Differences which were 
at one time supposed to be radical, such as the difference in the 
shape of the skull or the color of the skin, are regarded as modifi- 
cations of the same paleolithic type, due to causes acting from 
without rather than to intrinsic dissimilarities. If the different 
races are so many branches of the same stock, if there is no reason for 
supposing that the essential human faculties are lacking even in the 
most primitive groups of human beings, if, in particular, the obvious 
unlikenesses, as of color, thickness of the lips, etc., can not be viewed 
as signs of inherent inferiority, then at least one of the principal 
arguments, or rather pretexts, for the proud scorn of one race by 
another is destroyed. Those whose passion or whose greed leads 
them to violent and oppressive conduct toward millions of their 
fellow beings can no longer justify their proceedings by the plea 
that those whom they misuse are less than human or perhaps half 
human, or that they represent at any rate a baser type of the human 
species, and that therefore they may properly be assigned to the 
function of hewers of wood and drawers of water. The congress from . 
beginning to end reiterated the dictum of the essential unity of the 
races of mankind. The chief addresses were so many variations of 
this single theme. It was felt that the greatest step forward would 
be taken if this one idea could be driven home so as to become common 
property, and, of all the practical measures which it was proposed 
that the congress initiate, the same idea was the foundation. The 
thesis of the essential unity of mankind, however, was not taken in 
the sense of universal sameness, it was not understood to mean that 
each of the several component groups of humanity is capable of 
reaching the same degree of excellence along every line. The unity 
spoken of is an organic unity. It implies that the same essential 
faculties are present in all, and that it is to be assumed that every 
group is capable of contributing to the common stock something 
uniquely its own, something that in the full fruition of civilization 
can not be spared. 
The papers contributed to the congress were published in book 
form and were ready for distribution a week or two before the first 
session.t Among these papers, those emanating from men of science

-P-A-G-E-632
  
  612 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
and: those contributed by British proconsuls attracted, perhaps, 
the widest attention. Sir Charles Bruce, ex-governor of Mauritius, 
in writing on “The modern conscience in relation to treatment of 
dependent peoples and communities,” goes on record as saying that 
“the modern conscience demands the extension of the principles which 
have established. this (occidental) civilization in its relations with the 
East.” And, again, “The conflict between West and East must be 
adjusted on the same principle that has adjusted the conflicts of race 
and creed in the West. * * * History, reason, and recent experi- 
ence in Japan warn us that the adjustment must be made not in the 
spirit of the popular refrain ‘ East is east and west is west,’ but 
in the spirit of a nobler poetic formula: 
““God’s is the Occident, 
God’s is the Orient. 
“This is the spirit of modern conscience in the treatment of 
dependent peoples and communities.” 
Sir Sydney Oliver, governor of Jamaica, points out the heavy 
burden imposed on African peoples by the taxes required to support 
the kind of civilization which the white man seeks to impose among 
them and he plainly intimates his doubt whether the social, indus- 
trial, and religious ideals of the West are destined to prove suitable 
to the races.to whose molding they are applied. This, of course, need 
not imply radical inferiority on the part of the African peoples, but 
rather differences of environment and possibly of preponderant nat- 
ural endowment which may render adequate development impossible 
along the lines arbitrarily prescribed. The distinction which was 
once drawn between “day races” and “night races” and “ twilight 
races” presupposes that there are certain human beings who repre- 
sent the supreme type to which all others may more nearly or more 
distantly approximate. It presupposes that there are children of the 
sun and children of the night and between them those who represent 
the dim approach, the faint ascent, from the lower level to the highest. 
The proposition that the social, industrial, and religious ideals of 
Europe are not suitable to African peoples involves no such diserim- 
ination as this, for they may develop, and under the right influences 
will assuredly develop, social, industrial, and religious ideals of their 
own. 
Attention should also be directed to the paper of Sir Charles W. 
Dilke, which was written shortly before his death, in which he issues 
an impressive warning on the subject of recrudescence of slavery 
under more or less disguised forms: “ It is, indeed, not easy,” he says, 
“to feel certain whether the antislavery cause has lost or gained 
ground in our time. * * * The moment is one at which there is a 
real risk of general recrudescence of slave conditions in disguise.”

  THE FIRST UNIVERSAL RACES CONGRESS. 613 
THE RESULTS OF THE CONGRESS. 
The most important of these was the appointment of a committee 
instructed to bring about the establishment of an international insti- 
tute having for its aim to continue in systematic fashion the efforts 
begun by the congress. 
The objects of this institute are the following: 
I. To educate the public opinion of the world on the subject of the 
essential unity of mankind by encouraging the production of scien- 
tific papers similar to those published in the book of the congress and 
larger monographs and treatises on kindred subjects. The institute 
is to do strictly scientific work. Further, the institute is to pursue 
the same end by spreading the results achieved by the scientists in 
the form of popular tracts or of articles disseminated through the 
newspaper press. Also the writing of books and articles is to be 
encouraged which have for their aim to popularize the knowledge of 
the best traits of the peoples of the East among the nations of the 
West, and conversely, in order to engender mutual respect on the 
basis of mutual discriminating appreciation. It is also hoped that 
influence may be exerted to introduce the benevolent study of foreign 
types of civilization, especially among persons who are preparing to 
enter the diplomatic and colonial service. A friendly attitude toward 
foreigners and an understanding of the excellent qualities of the litera- 
ture, art, and institutions of the people to whom they are sent would 
not only render them more useful to their own nation, but would make 
their influence more beneficial to those with whom they come in 
contact. 
II. The International Institute is intended to a certain extent to 
fill a gap left vacant by The Hague Tribunal. The Hague Tribunal 
concerns itself only with complications which arise between sovereign 
nations. It can not intervene to remedy or even take cognizance of 
instances of crying injustice that may occur within a sovereign na- 
tion, as between the ruling and the subject classes of the population. 
But, the world over, the relations between oppressed groups within 
independent states, or groups which regard themselves as oppressed, 
with their oppressors are becoming more and more strained, and this 
is undoubtedly one of the causes of the universal unrest of which 
Lord Cromer speaks in his book on Ancient and Modern Imperialism. 
There is plainly needed a new kind of forum in which the griefs and 
grievances of those millions of human beings who are impotent to 
help themselves may be considered from the standpoint of right and 
truth. This forum can not be a court; no court could possibly be 
devised which shall exercise jurisdiction in the domestic affairs of 
sovereign states; but a bureau of information may well be created   
 
-P-A-G-E-634
  614 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
which shall impartially investigate the conflicting claims of parties 
to controversies of this kind, publishing authorized statements from 
both sides, and perhaps sending investigators of its own to collect 
the best available information on the spot. The ideal purpose of such 
a bureau would again be educational, namely: To instruct public 
opinion. And public opinion, especially the concentrated public 
opinion of the world to-day, is a force which, if rightly directed, will 
prove well-nigh irresistible, even in those cases where the situation 
seems at first most unpromising. The obvious reason why at present 
public opinion does not actually exercise its complete effect is because 
it is not sure of itself and therefore hesitant. The sources from which 
it is derived are often impure; the press especially is frequently em- 
ployed by those whose interest it is to misrepresent the facts. 
Thoughtful people everywhere know that this is the case and there- 
fore shrink from expressing themselves with decision, when if they 
felt they had the right to do so on the basis of reliable information 
their voices would be heard with no uncertain sound and carry the 
greatest weight. I cite as one instance the attitude of the world’s 
public opinion toward the Young Turks to-day. Are the statements 
in the newspapers which put them in a bad light inspired by the 
sinister influences of those whose selfish interest it is to see the reform 
movement in Turkey miscarry, or are the Young Turks in fact fol- 
lowing in the evil footsteps of their predecessors? Outside of the 
few who have access to first-class information, who to-day would 
venture an opinion? An international bureau of information having 
at its head responsible men of undoubted character and ability, and 
with abundant resources at its command, might be expected to secure 
information which in such and similar cases would put us all in a 
better position to judge. 
III. The third object of the International Institute is to encourage 
and if necessary to subsidize what may be called experiments in the 
pedagogy of backward races. An example of what this means may 
be found in the account of the Batak Institute, at Leyden, by Dr. 
Nieuwenhuis, on page 259 of the Proceedings of the Congress. 
“Colonial powers,” says Dr. Nieuwenhuis, “know, as a rule, far too 
little of the people of different races under their sway to be able to 
maintain an intercourse with them that may be called rational in all 
respects or to establish a rule in harmony with the opinions of the 
subject-race and the popular institutions based on them.” The Bataks 
are a tribe living in the northern part of Sumatra. The work of the 
Batak Institute has been carried on from 1905 to 1911. Its aim is to 
collect as complete a body of information as possible about the Batak 
people, its local conditions and needs, and then to undertake practical 
measures intended to promote the economic and general progress of 
the natives. In the season of 1911 practical agriculturalists were 
 
-P-A-G-E-635
    THE FIRST UNIVERSAL RACES CONGRESS. 615 
sent to the Karo Plateau, in the district of the east coast of Sumatra, 
jin order to assist in improving the cultivation of rice and to stimulate 
the growth of produce such as is likely to find market in the low- . 
lands. 
Similar institutions with perhaps somewhat wider aims might be 
established in the interests of other peoples and tribes. 
Mention also should here be made of the excellent work which the 
United States Bureau of Education is doing in developing the rein- 
deer industry of the Eskimos in Alaska; that is, in assisting the eco- 
nomic development of a backward people in such a way as to take 
due account of their surroundings and opportunities, of their needs 
and capabilities. 
The International Institute is to be established at London; both 
because that city more than any other capital is in intimate touch 
with all the different quarters of the globe, and because it will be 
easier there than elsewhere to find representatives of different coun- 
tries permanently or temporarily resident, and, consequently, able to 
take part in the councils of an international organization. The nu- 
cleus of the governing body of the International Institute will un- 
doubtedly consist of Englishmen, but the composition of the institute 
will nevertheless be broadly international. The practical success of 
the program above outlined will depend on our finding men of great 
probity and eminence who will be willing to accept membership on 
the governing body, and also on the possibility that persons of very 
great wealth may come to realize the far-reaching benefits which such 
an institute is competent to confer and may be ready to place abun- 
dant means at its disposal. 
Enough has now been said to give a general idea of the scope and 
animating spirit of the meetings, and especially to dispel the suspi- 
cion of sentimentalism, if it has existed in the mind of the reader of 
these pages. For those who are interested in education, special allu- 
sion may perhaps be made to Prof. Mackenzie’s paper on “ Ethical 
Teaching in Schools with Regard to Races,” pages 433-439. He dis- 
cusses the subject under five heads: 
1. How may moral education cultivate the conception of human 
personality and its rights? 
2. Moral education should lead to an appreciation of the essential 
likeness of the various races and classes, in spite of their points of 
superficial differences. 
8. It is qualities of character that form the real basis of superiority 
in men or nations. 
4. That different peoples, different classes, different sexes, and so 
on, have each a distinctive type of personality with a distinctive 
value of its own.  
-P-A-G-E-636
  616 EDUCATION REPORT, 1911. 
5. The identity and the comprehensive character of the human 
ideal as evolved in a number of different forms. 
In conclusion, a word should be said of the educative effect of the 
congress upon those who participated in it. This, if the writer is to 
judge from his own observation, was exceptionally deep and is likely 
to prove lasting. At one of the preliminary conferences that pre~ 
ceded the opening session there were gathered in a committee room 
some 50 delegates of different color and coming from Asia, Africa, 
Europe, and America. Merely to find oneself a part of such a body 
of human beings was a most impressive experience. And then to 
listen to what was said; to see the Persian, Hindoo, the Chinaman, 
the Turk, the dark-skinned South African Negro arise one after an- 
other and express in the language of cultured men the thoughts and 
ideals of one’s own belief and aspiration could not but convert the 
bare theoretical notion of humanity which we all harbor into a potent 
realized conviction. And the mere contact during eight consecutive 
sessions and on equal terms with men and women of such dissimilar 
origin who yet shared a common outlook could not but have a prac- 
tically educative effect of the greatest value. Such congresses, there- 
fore, ought to be repeated. If the changes they effect in the outside 
world can only be slow, the good they would do to those who take 
part in them would be immeasurable. 
Again, those who came to the congress smarting under the sense 
of wrong could not fail to have their moral horizon widened as they 
followed the proceedings. For they could not but recogriize that 
their specific grievance is but one item in the sum of evil which man 
suffers at the hands of his fellow man—one manifestation of that 
spirit which the progress of civilization must cast out. The griev- 
ance of a single group, no matter how justly resented, is apt to pro- 
duce a certain collective selfishness in the members of that group, 
concentration on their own sufferings, and comparative indifference 
to equal or greater suffering afflicting other groups. The congress 
was, as it were, a theater of humanity. The curtain rose and dis- 
played a vast scene; one after another there appeared dimly-outlined 
ghosts of men, sorrow bowed and making mute appeal. We peered, 
as it were, into the depth of great realms of darkness. But we saw 
also the light and the standard bearers of it beginning to penetrate 
into that realm. 
One may be sure that such a spectacle as this could not but tend 
somewhat to counteract that collective selfishness of which I have 
just spoken. The American Negro, for example, preoccupied with the 
disabilities of the ten millions of his own race living in the United 
States, could hardly fail to gain a new perspective by thinking of the 
condition of one hundred and twenty million negroes of Africa. 
   
-P-A-G-E-637
    THE FIRST UNIVERSAL RACES CONGRESS. 617 
Similar reflections must have obtruded themselves on the mind of 
the Russian Jew; and even the socialist and the social reformer, 
whose whole mind is concentrated on bringing about economic 
changes within civilized lands and who is always tempted to con- 
found the interests of the wage earners in civilized lands with the 
interests of humanity at large, will perhaps have been compelled to 
pause and acknowledge to himself how immense is the problem with 
the fringe of which, and only a fringe, he is dealing. I do not, of 
course, for an instant imply that we should therefore be less zealous 
and less concentrated upon that portion of the field which it is ap- 
pointed to us to till, or that we should feel less earnestly that in 
attempting to solve a fraction of the problem we are contributing 
what we can to the solution of the whole. I only mean that we should 
see our work sub specie humanitatis, and I venture to express the 
belief that such undertakings as the Universal Races Congress help 
us to do so. :

DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, 
BUREAU OF EDUCATION, 
Washington, D. C., November 8, 1888. 
The Honorable ihe SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR, 
Washington, D, C.: 
Sir: I have the honor to forward herewith a monograph upon the 
History of Education in Florida, by Prof. George Gary Bush, Ph. D. 
(Heidelberg). 
This is one of the series of Coitivitiations to American Educational | 
History, edited by Prof. Herbert B. Adams, Ph. D., of Johns Hopkins 
University, the preparation of which you approved by your letter of 
. March 29, 1888. 
This monograph, though written to accompany the series of histor- 
ical papers upon higher education in the United States, treats not alone 
of higher education in Florida. Its purpose is to set forth, in addition, 
the growth and development of the school system of the State, and to 
emphasize particularly the rapid advance made in all educational matters 
during the past decade. 
Beginning with the earliest organized efforts to furnish instruction 
under the auspices of educational societies, and the attempt to intro- 
duce the system of Fellenberg, a review is given of the journals of the 
Legislature previous to the adoption of the Constitution of 1868, and 
such facts are presented as bear upon the subject of education. The 
legal organization of the school system, as it existed previous to the 
Civil War, is thus shown, together with the history of the school lands 
donated to the State, and the funds by which the schools were in part 
or wholly sustained. 
The point is made that the early legislation with reference to schools, 
though effected largely by men of wealth, was for the benefit princi- 
pally of the children of the poor. 
Attention is called to the establishment in 1852 of the first public 
school to be sustained by a tax levied upon individual property, and 
_(though no uniform system had been secured) to the great improvement 
made during this decade in the condition of the schools.

  4 HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN FLORIDA. 
The War era passed, the elaborate system of common schools provided 
for in the State Constitution of 1868, and by legislative acts in 1869, is 
reviewed at length, and the substance of these provisions embodied in 
the monograph. 
The favor with which the system was apparently received, and the 
rapidity with which the State board and the county boards were organ- 
ized and entered upon their duties, are touched upon, and then a his- 
tory is given of the development of the system, of the opposition which 
it later encountered, of the lack of competent teachers, as also of school 
buildings and school funds, until an era of brighter promise is reached. 
From that period, less than a decade ago, the progress made in public 
school education has been most satisfactory, and it is shown that the 
aggregate results will bear favorable comparison with the educational 
statistics of any of the States. Statistics are given which place in con- 
trast the earlier and later years, and exhibit the rapid increase in the 
number of schools, in pupils, and funds. Mention is made of the valua- 
ble aid rendered to the State by annual contributions from the Peabody 
Fund and other agencies organized for like purposes. 
The duties of the State Superintendent of Instruction and of the 
Board of Education, of the county boards and county superintendent, 
of the local trustees, and the teachers employed in the common schools 
are defined, and the relations they sustain to one another indicated. 
The admirable work done by Northern societies, by the State, and 
by the agent of the Peabody Fund for the education of the freedmen, 
from the year in which the War closed until schools for colored chil- 
dren were placed upon an equal footing with the other schools of the 
State, is traced at some length, while the eagerness of the freedmen to 
learn and the progress they have made is noted, and a history of some 
of the more important schools established for them is briefly given. 
During the past five years nothing else has done so much to elevate 
the standard of education in Florida as the efficient aid rendered by 
teachers’ institutes and normal schools. These instrumentalities, which 
owe their success, in large measure, to the earnest labors and wise 
supervision of the present Superintendent of Public Instruction, are 
described and their importance to the existing educational system ac- 
knowledged. 
Reference is next made to the academies established before the War, 
and to the present condition of the high schools, which, with a single 
exception, do not compare favorably with schools of like name in the 
older States. 
With a statement of the public lands received from the National 
Government for the establishment of “two seminaries of learning” 
and an agricultural college and university, the paper takes up the his- 
tory of secondary and higher education. This begins with an act of 
the Legislature in 1851, in which it is provided that “Two seminaries of 
learning shall be established, one upon the east, the other upon the 
 
-P-A-G-E-5
  LETTER OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. - 6 
west side of the Suwannee River.” These seminaries were located, the 
one at Ocala (later removed to Gainesville), the other at Tallahassee, 
and long remained the only public high schools in Florida. Historical 
sketches of these institutions are introduced, showing the work accom- 
plished by them, their financial resources, the condition of the academic 
buildings and grounds, their educational appliances, and the character 
and attainments of their boards of instruction, 
No public institution of Florida has passed through so many vicissi- | 
tudes or suffered so much for the lack of friends as the State Agricult- 
ural College. The endeavor has been made in this monograph to present 
with impartiality the facts of its history, including the acts of various 
Legislatures with reference to its location, establishment, board of man- 
agement, and finances; and evidence is adduced to show that it is now 
well worthy of the patronage of the State, possessing as it does an able 
and energetic faculty, commodious buildings and grounds, collectionsin 
natural history, mineralogy, and geology, a well-equipped laboratory, 
anexperimental station furnished with excellent appliances for the study 
of agriculture, and a manual training school, which affords practice in 
working in wood and metal and the best facilities for draughting and de- 
signing. A page is devoted to the Florida University, with its meteoric 
appearance and brief history. 
The remainder of the paper is devoted to a description of the colleges 
founded and sustained by various religious societies, to which are added 
a brief mention of the State Institute for the Blind and Deaf, and ref- 
erences to certain schools whose aim is to furnish a good secondary edu- 
cation. 
Of the denominational colleges, Rollins College at Winter Park and 
De Land University at De Land, are placed in the first rank of the higher 
educational institutions of the State, and their history, as herewith pre- 
sented, shows that in the quality of their work, the devotion of friends, 
and increasing resources, promise is given of a successful future. 
I beg leave to recommend the publication of this paper as a Circular 
of Information, and to subscribe myself, ~ 
Very respectfully. your obedient servant, 
N. H. R. Dawson, 
Commissioner.

HISTORY OF HDUCATION Te 
FLORIDA. 
The present educational system of Florida has been created since the 
formation of the Constitution of 1868. Previous to that period there 
was lack of organization, and the facilities afforded for obtaining an 
education were inadequate to meet the demands of a rapidly increasing 
population. During the past twenty years the material progress of the 
State, though very great, has not kept pace with the advance in all 
matters pertaining to education. This statement finds its confirmation 
principally in the history of the pa&st five years, during which, not alone 
the public school system has been perfected, but educational advan- 
, tages of the highest order have been placed within the reach of all. 
The question may well be asked why, after the close of the Civil War, 
Florida did not, proceed more quickly to the establishment of schools. 
It is not enough to say that it was due to her poverty, or to the vast- 
ness of her undeveloped territory and the sparseness of her population. 
There were other reasons of greater import, which grew out of the in- 
heritance received from the established order before the War. This 
led the people to adopt ideas respecting education that had prevailed 
in the earlier history of the State. Moreover, it blinded their eyes to 
the fact that the leaven of a new spirit was at work, and, though many 
barriers were in the way of its rapid development, that nothing would be 
able to arrest permanently its progress. Here again was the old battle 
of age with impetuous but clear-sighted youth. The adherents of the 
new order were sure to win, but their success was greatly promoted by 
the addition to their number of a large body of settlers from other States, 
who brought with them broad views of the importance to the State of 
affording the opportunity for the highest intellectual training. 
Thus the entire system of education was changed, and the benefits 
resulting therefrom have since continued to receive wide acknowledg- 
ment. The old order was well-nigh void of any system ; the new order 
has adopted the most advanced methods known to our time. It has 
learned that the only way to have efficient schools is to provide efficient 
teachers. Hence, normal schools for both the white and colored popu- 
lation have been established and supported by the State, and teachers’ 
institutes, under the supervision of the Superintendent of Public In- 
struction, are regularly held in many of the counties.

  12 HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN FLORIDA. 
Until within a very brief period there were no studies pursued in the 
schools that would be classed under the higher education. By the strict- 
est definition there is doubtless still very little collegiate instruction ; 
but so great has been the advance in all educational work, and so hope- 
fal is the promise for the future, that Florida well deserves to have her 
progress in this respect placed beside that of other and more favored 
States of the Union. More than in most other States is the history of 
higher education intertwined with that of the secondary and common 
schools, and very unsuccessful, as it appears to the writer, would be 
the attempt at the present time to write a history of the first which 
should not include a history of all. 
FLORIDA EDUCATION SOCIETY. 
In Volume I of the American Annals of Education, published in Bos- 
ton in 1831, the following notice appears with reference to one of the 
earliest literary movements in Florida: “ An important step has been 
taken by some friends of education—the organization of a society, ar- 
ranged upon substantially the same plan asa State lyceum.” This was 
called the Florida Education Society, and was organized at Tallahas- 
see, January 23, 1831. Its object was to collect and diffuse information 
on the subject of education, and endeavor to procure the establishment 
of such a general system of instruction as would be suited to the wants 
and condition of the Territory. A membership fee was required, direct- 
ors appointed, and monthly and tri-monthly meetings arranged for. 
Steps were also taken to organize branch societies, and the delegates 
and secretaries of the latter were required to report to the parent soci- 
ety all the information they could obtain relative to education in their 
respective districts. Later in the year the Governor of the Territory 
was authorized by law to appoint three commissioners, whose duty was 
to inquire into the condition of schools, the wants of the people re- 
specting education, and ascertain the number of schools, qualifications 
of teachers, branches taught, mode of instruction, and the number of 
children favored with and destitute of the means of education. They 
were to report upon the “ best system of education and the best meaps 
of carrying the system into full effect.” 
In the same year and as an outgrowth of the Florida Education Society, 
which had awakened such general interest throughout the State, a 
ladies’ educational society was formed and a zeal for intellectual im- 
provement manifested, such as is rarely seen in’a newly settled region. 
At this time the agricultural or manual labor schools established by 
Fellenberg in Switzerland were finding many admirers in America. 
Through the recommendation of the education society a few of the 
citizens of Tallahassee decided to organize a ‘‘Fellenberg” school. In 
the American Quarterly Register for May, 1832, appears this record: 
“Five individuals have.agreed, if it can be done at an expense within 
their means, to purchase a small tract of land and form a small manual

labor school somewhere in the neighborhood of Tallahassee. A teacher 
is to be employed to take charge of the limited number of pupils; suita- 
ble buildings are to be erected for the accommodation of the teacher 
and pupils, who are to board together, with as little connection as possi- 
ble with the inhabitants in the vicinity. The pupils will be required to 
devote a certain number of hours daily to agricultural and mechanical 
employments of the simplest kinds. No pupil will be admitted except 
with the consent of the teacher and each of the proprietors, nor suffered 
to remain in the school unless he submits to all its regulations. The 
studies, at the commencement, are to be confined to the usual branches 
of a good English education, including mechanics, botany, chemistry, 
etc.” 
This project met with such favor that between six and seven hundred 
dollars were subscribed, to be paid annually, besides a free offering of 
as much land as might be needed. It was thought that, if the lands 
set apart by Congress for a seminary and for common schools could be 
appropriated to the use of the Fellenberg schools, ample funds would 
soon be in hand to inaugurate suecessfully the new system. 
The branch of the educational society established in St. Augustine 
reported an “alarming neglect of education in the Territory since the 
cession ;” that by most the matter was viewed with indifference; and 
that the obstacles which the scattered population presented rendered 
the establishing of even a limited system of common schools extremely 
difficult, if not impracticable. There were then (1832) 341 children be- 
tween the ages of five and fifteen, but only 137 of these were receiving 
any school instruction. An attempt was made to establish a free 
school, and though at first greatly encouraged, there is no evidence that 
either this project or the more important one at Tallahassee was ever 
carried toa successful termination. At this time meetings resembling 
lyceums were held in St. Augustine for discussion and mutual improve- 
ment, which called forth “the resources of every individual for the 
benefit of the community.” 
Unfortunately the ardor of this progressive spirit of which we have 
spoken seems to have been soon quenched. In a brief time the Florida 
Education Society and its auxiliaries ceased to exist, and no others 
were established in their place.!' Could some wise system of education 
have found encouragement and been developed so as to have kept pace 
with the growth of the, Territory and State, it might have secured for 
Florida an educational rank not inferior to that of any commonwealth 
in the Union. 
EARLY LEGISLATION AFFECTING PRIMARY EDUCATION. 
A review of the journals of the Legislature, previous to the adoption 
of the Constitution of 1868, will help us to form a just estimate of the 
1A Historical Society was organized in St. Augustine in 1856, but it was short-lived. 
This is much to be regretted, as Florida furnishes a fruitful field for historical re- 
search,

interest taken by the people of Florida in the matter of education. In 
December, 1835, while Florida was still a Territory, ‘the register of 
the land office was charged with the duty of selecting and securing the 
various lands granted by Congress for schools, seminaries, and other 
purposes.” By act of March 2, 1839, three school trustees were or- 
dered to be chosen in each township. They were to have the care of the 
sixteenth section lands in their township, lease the’ same, and apply the 
rents or profits for the benefit of the common schools; and, in case such 
schools did not exist, it was their duty to organize and support them. 
In March, 1843, these duties were intrusted to the sheriffs of counties, 
who were commissioned to give special care to the education of the 
poor children of the county. But the legal organization of the school 
system, as it existed previous to the Civil War, was substantially ef- 
fected by the act of 1839, already referred to, to which amendments 
were made in 1840, 1844, and 1845. As amended, the old school law 
provided not only for township trustees to look after the raising of a 
revenue from the sixteenth section school lands, and its application to 
the establishment and support of common schools, but also for at least 
a partial supervision of the acts of these trustees by the judges of pro. 
bate, who were to serve as superintendents of common schools in their 
respective counties. They were to see that the sixteenth section lands 
were held inviolate for the use of schools; to receive and appropriate the 
money derived from them; and attend to all matters connected with 
the advancement of education. The trustees were required to report to 
the judges, on or before the first Monday in December of each year, 
the number of teachers employed in the township, the number of 
children of both sexes, the different branches taught, and such other 
information as might pertain to the welfare of the schools. The judges 
were to consolidate the returns and forward their report to the Secre- 
tary of State, by whom it was laid before the General Assembly of 
Florida. Beyond the revising of these reports by the Secretary it does 
not appear that the State exercised any supervision over her schools, 
or that there was any law which required that the schools established 
out of the proceeds of the township school lands should be free to all, 
or any provision for a tax on property or persons for their support. It 
is probable that they were of brief annual duration, and attended 
mainly, if not wholly, by children of the poor, except in those cases 
where the latter were placed. in other schools and their tuition fees paid 
out of the public school fund. ¢ 
In 1849 an act was passed to provide for the establishment of com- 
mon schools, whose doors should be open only to white children. In 
the.same year the Legislature provided that the school fund should con- 
sist of the proceeds from the school lands, and five per cent. of the net re- 
ceipts from other lands granted by Congress; also the proceeds from all 
estates, real or personal, escheating to the State, and from all property 
found on the coast or shores of the State, In 1850 the counties were.

authorized to provide by taxation for the support of schools, but the 
amount levied could not exceed four dollars annually for each child of 
school age. The school fund was also enlarged by all moneys received 
by the State from the sale of slaves under the act of 1829. 
’ 
THE SCHOOL LANDS. 
It was not the original intention that the sixteenth section lands should 
be sold and merged into a common fund, but rather that by rental, or 
by the interest on the purchase-money if sold, such section should con- 
fer its benefits upon the township alone to which it belonged. Ac- 
cordingly the Governor and Legislative Council were authorized by act of 
Congress to take possession of the school lands thus reserved, and rent 
or lease them for the support of common schools in the township ; but 
as far as can be ascertained only one township ever organized to get 
the benefit of theact. As the sixteenth section lands that were valuable 
were, in the days preceding the abolition of slavery, mostly in the hands 
of men who had no need of assistance in educating their children, and 
who were, as a rule, too proud to receive it; and as, in other townships 
less fertile, where the population was sparse and the settlers generally 
poor, these lands had little intrinsic value, and no value at all for the 
purpose named in the act, the result was that this law wrought injus- 
tice, since its benefits accrued to the rich and not to the poor. The Leg- 
islature, therefore, directed that the lands thus reserved should be sold 
and the fund consolidated. This act, done in most part by men of 
wealth, was highly commendable, as it was practically a concession by 
them for the benefit of the poor. Though considerable time was con- 
sumed in making the transfer and patenting these lands to the State, 
yet as early as the years 1852-54, on the journals of the Legislature, 
will be found the biennial report of the State Superintendent of Public 
Instruction, with full statistics respecting the school fund, the sales of 
school lands, the investment of the proceeds, and the apportionment of 
the interest among the counties according to the number of children 
of school age. The apportionment, however, was so small, amounting . 
to only thirty cents per capita, that it was probably of little practical ben- 
efit anywhere. At first few counties organized so as to put the school 
system into operation, and only two contributed anything from the 
county treasury to augment the sum received from the State. By a re- 
vision of the common school law in 1853 the apportionments were placed 
in the hands of county commissioners, who were authorized to take 
from the county treasury such sum as they might deem necessary for 
the support of the schools. As these officials were not required to ac- 
eount to any one for their disposition of the fund, it generally happened 
that it was distributed among the teachers of private schools according 
as their necessities demanded. It may readily be inferred that in the 
midst of this chaos of affairs with respect to administration, there was 
as yet no common school system. But still, even in these years there

16 HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN FLORIDA. 
was some progress, for though the sales of land might be small, yet they 
formed the basis of a fund, inviolate and perpetual, which was to in- 
crease from year to year and lend more and more help towards the edu- 
cation of the children of the State. 
TAXATION FOR THE SUPPORT OF SCHOOLS. 
As early as 1852 another movement had been set on foot by the Hon. 
D. S. Walker, since Governor of the State, and now Judge of the Cir- 
cuit Court. By him the idea was conceived of a public school for white 
children that should be sustained by a tax levied upon the property of 
the city where he resided (Tallahassee). Through his influence such a 
school was established and successfully conducted, and this is worthy 
of mention, since it was among the earliest attempts in the South to 
support schools by taxation. 
In 1858 the Superintendent reports that there were 20,855 children of 
school age; that the amount of interest apportioned to the counties was 
$6,542.60; and that “a few of the counties were taking hold of the matter 
of schools and engaging teachers, but usually for a term of only three 
months.” He states it as his conviction that public schools supported by 
taxation were not only superior to private ones heretofore patronized, but 
that the cost to the individual tax-payer did not equal half the amount of 
his former tuition fees; and that in addition to this, and of even greater 
value, was the fact that nearly all the children werein school. It is evi- 
dent from the history of Florida during the decade ending with 1860, that a 
‘sentiment favorable to free public schools was developing, and that it 
was in great part checked, or its further growth rendered impossible, 
by the events of the following years. Still, even during the Civil War, 
the State and its officers earnestly devised plans and labored for the 
perfecting of a system of public schools; yet little progress could be 
made, as the thoughts and energies of the people were absorbed in the 
conflict impending. In the Constitution of the State framed immedi- 
ately after the close of the War an article was incorporated which was 
designed to secure to the schools of the State the income derived from 
the “school lands.” But the turbulent days of reconstruction were un- 
favorable to the development of any deep interest in education, and, 
accordingly, no effective legislation with reference to schools was secured. 
until the adoption of the Gonstitution of 1868, and the passage of the 
school law of 1869. 
THE NEW SCHOOL LAW. 
According to this law the State assumed the education of all her chil- 
dren without distinction or preference. The Legislature, as authorized 
by the Constitution, established a uniform system of common schools. 
It provided for asuperintendent of public instruction, whose term of office 
should be four years. It ordered the forming of a school fund out of the 
following sources: “The proceeds of all lands that have been or may
-P-A-G-E-19
  
THE NEW SCHOOL LAW. 17 
hereafter be granted the State by the United States for educational 
purposes; appropriations by the State; the proceeds of lands or other 
property which may acerue to the State by escheat or forfeiture; the 
proceeds of all property granted to the State when the purpose of such 
grant shall not be specified; all moneys which may be paid as an exemp- 
tion from military duties; all fines collected under the penal laws of 
the State; such portion of the per capita tax! as may be prescribed by 
law for educational purposes; and 25 per centum of the sales of public 
lands which are now or may hereafter be owned by the State.” Only 
the income derived from this fund could be used, and this must be ap- 
plied to aid in the maintenance of common schools and to the purchase 
of books and suitable apparatus. The law further provided that there 
should be an annual school tax of not less than one mill on the dollar of 
all taxable property in the State; moreover, that each county should be 
required to add to this for the support of schools a sum not less than 
one-half the amount apportioned to each county for that year from the 
income of the common school fund.? The income of the fund was or- 
dered to be distributed among the several counties in proportion to the 
number of children residing therein between the ages of four? and 
twenty-one years;* but the neglect of any school district (7. ¢., of any 
county) to maintain a school or schools for at least three months in the 
year should work a forfeiture of its portion of the common school fund 
during such neglect. It provided also for a board of education, whose 
duties were to be prescribed by the Legislature.® 
The school law of 1869 was received with great favor, and no time 
was lost in putting it into operation. Nearly every member of the Leg- 
islature had been, or now became, its earnest advocate, and even before 
they left for their homes they took steps to initiate the work of organ- 
ization in every county. The law required that State and county super- 
intendents be appointed by the Governor and approved by the Senate ; 
1 By the Constitution of 1886 the fines and the per capita tax, in addition to the 
county’s proportion of the income from the State school fund and the ‘mill tax,” 
are ordered to form a part of the county school fund, to be disbursed by the county 
board of public instruction ‘solely for the maintenance and support of public free 
schools.” . 
2 Art. XU, Sec. 8, of the Constitution of 1886 orders that each county be required to 
“assess and collect annually for the support of public free schools therein a tax of not 
Jess than 3 mills nor more than 5 mills on the dollar of all taxable property in the 
same.” 
8 By the new Constitution six and twenty-one years. 
4Exception was to be made “in favor of small schools in neighborhoods where the 
number of youth who should attend is small aud their average attendance at school 
ranges high.” ; 
*This, with a few modifications, is still in force, having proved itself one of the 
best school laws of this country. It was largely framed by Hon. C. Thurston Chase, 
State Superintendent of Schools, after he had made a study of the different school sys- 
tems of the older States, and consulted with some of their most eminent educators and 
school officers. .

that the board of instruction for each county, to consist of five members, 
be recommended by the representatives of the county and appointed 
by the State Board of Education on the nomination of the State Super- 
intendent. As soon, therefore, as recommendations for boards of public 
instruction were received, as provided by law, the appointments were 
made. Where county superintendents had been appointed and had 
qualified, organizations were speedily effected. In other cases tempo- 
rary organizations were formed, and the names of persons suitable for 
superintendents sent in to the Governor for appointment. Thus, in a 
brief time, after long years of waiting, Florida inaugurated a system of © 
education. ‘ 
TIME NEEDED TO DEVELOP THE NEW SYSTEM. 
But it must not be supposed that this important movement met with 
no opposition. To some, any system, or lack of system, when shielded 
by the usage of years, comes to have a value and sacredness out of all 
’ proportion toits rightful claims. Thus it happened that, through bitter 
opposition on the part of a few, the benefits to be derived from the 
school law were not speedily realized. The Commissioner for 1870 re- 
ports that the new system “has made little or no progress, notwith- 
standing the ability and utmost endeavors of the newly-appointed Su- 
perintendent ;” and adds that “‘education encounters fearful obstacles.” 
Less than one-fifth of the children and youth between four and twenty- 
one years were then enrolled in the public schools. The Superintendent, 
in a more hopeful spirit, says that the schools are rapidly gaining favor 
with the people, and “ there is every reason to believe that the system 
will triumph, and, becoming a part of the permanent policy of the State, 
will endure to bless through party changes and successive administra- 
tions.” The agent of the Peabody Fund says of it in 1872: “ During 
the three years of its history it has had unusual difficulties to contend 
with, but a great advance has been made, and it is gaining rapidly in 
popularesteem. Whatsome of those difficulties were can be understood 
when itis known that in many counties in 1869 there was an almost 
total lack of school-houses ; added to this was the small number of com- 
petent teachers and the insufficiency of the school funds. One county 
reports that previous to 1869 “ the schéols were kept in small cabins, 
out-houses, and sometimes in dwellings, by itinerant teachers who 
scarcely ever professed to teach anything higher than Webster’s Spell- 
ing-Book, and arithmetic as far as compound numbers.” 
During the years 1868 and 1869 the General Government, at an ex- 
pense of $52,600, caused some twenty school. buildings to be built, which 
accommodated about 2,500 pupils. In the decade beginning with the ~ 
year 1870 many of the more prominent towns of the State of Florida 
(reaching one year to the number of sixteen) received from the Peabody 
Fund donations for the support of schools, varying in amount from two 
hundred to one thousand four hundred dollars each.

STATISTICS. a9 
In the report of schools for 1874 (a very able and suggestive paper 
by the Secretary of State, the Hon. Samuel B, McLin, who was acting 
Superintendent), the school question is very fully considered.  “ Half 
a decade ago,” he says, ‘there were no schools outside a few of the 
larger towns or cities. We have now nearly six hundred, scattered 
throughout the State. They are springing up by the highways and by- 
ways as pledges of future improvement and progress. * * * This is 
a revolution that cannot go backward. It creates its own momentum. 
It moves by a power within itself, and strikes out the light and heat of its 
own vitality.” A law enactedin 1872 provided that all elementary schools 
should be graded, and divided into primary, intermediate, and gram- 
mar, and that the branches taught be confined to spelling, reading, 
writing, arithmetic, geography, and history; but up to 1877 little re- 
gard had been paid to the. law, except by such schools as were aided 
by the Peabody Fund. These were uniformly graded and the school 
year lengthened to ten months. In the years following 1877 the system 
of grading was rapidly adopted, and it now generally prevails. 
The record of the progress made by the public schools, more particu- 
larly since 1880, forms a very bright page in the history of Florida. 
Each year has chronicled a steady advance, and the aggregate results 
will bear favorable comparison with the educational statistics of any 
other State. The Superintendent has been able to report a gratifying 
progress in nearly every particular; in the growth of the schools in pub- 
lic favor ; in the increased number of schools and school children ; in im- 
proved buildings and enlarged funds; in a more intelligent ‘ed better 
instructed body of teachers ; in a lengthened school year; and in a ratio 
of daily attendance which, if correctly reported, probably can not be 
surpassed in any of the older States.) 
STATISTICS.” 
The school statistics during the earlier history of Florida are not very 
satisfactory, being apparently very incomplete. In 1840, five years be- 
fore the admission of the State into the Union, there were 18 academies 
and grammar schools, with 732 pupils, and 51 common schools, with 925 
pupils. The census report of 1850 gives the population of Florida as 
87,000, of whom 47,000 were whites, and states that there were then 10 
academies and 69 common schools, with 3,129 pupils. In 1860 (popula- 
tion 140,000) there were 97 public schools, with 2,032 pupils, and 138 
1The school year consists properly of three terms of three months each, each month 
having twenty-two teaching days. In order to receive aid from the State fund the 
school must be in session for at least three months. Where schools are kept only for 
this short period in the year (and this until recently has been very generally the case 
outside of the villages) the ratio of daily attendance is doubtless much encney than it 
would be if the school were continued throughout the year.

Reports of the Commissioner of Education since 1867,

academies and other schools, with 4,486 pupils. The income from the 
school fund was $22,386. In 1872, three years after the inauguration 
of the school system, with a population of about 195,000, the number 
of public schools was 400, and the expenditures in support of them 
$80,000. The permanent school fund amounted to $300,000. In 1880 
the population had increased to 269,493 and the number of public 
schools to 1,131. In 1883-84 there were:

By the close of 1888 the number of public schools had increased to 
. 2,249, the number of teachers to 2,413, of whom 620 were black and 
1,793 white, while the number enrolled and the average daily attend- 
ance remained about the same as stated for the year 1887. The 
amount received from the school tax, from the common school fund, 
and from the State one-mill tax, and expended for the support of schools 
during the year, was $484,110.23. The number of private schools and 
colleges in the State, as reported by the counties, is 137. 
Tt will be seen that the increase in the number of schools since 1884 
is 745. The gain for the same period in the total attendance is over 
24,000, and the increase in the value of school property (not reported. 
above for 1888) is not less than $335,000. 
1 The enumeration of children and youth between the ages of four and twenty-one 
years and also between the ages of six and twenty-one years must be taken every 
four years by the county tax assessor. 
2Jn addition to this there remain 400,000 acres of the lands donated to the State for 
common schools, which have an estimated value of $1.25 per acre. It should be re- 
membered also that Florida expended, during the Civil War, the principal of her 
common school fund and seminary funds for ‘‘arms, ammunition, and other purposes,” 
and that she came out of the great struggle without other means for the reorganiza~ 
tion of her schools than what could be derived from the lands remaining unsold and 
from the taxatiou of the people for purposes of education. 
   
-P-A-G-E-23
  
  PRESENT OUTLOOK. 21 
As an indication of the interest taken in education, it may be said 
that thirty-four out of the forty-five counties in the State levy the mag- 
imum tax of five mills toward the support of schools. 
PRESENT OUTLOOK. 
Much of the’eredit for this remarkable advance in public school ed- 
ucation since the beginning of 1884 is due to the Hon. A. J. Russell, 
the present efficient Superintendent of Public Instruction. In a paper 
prepared by him in 1886, he makes use of the following language: 
“Thus we have reached a climax of which the people may be grate- 
fully proud, and confidently hope for the very best results upon the 
next generation of its citizens. School-houses, suitably furnished, are 
now scattered in neighborhoods in most of the counties, while there is 
not a county in the State not organized in accordance with the school 
law, having good schools in operation for both white and colored chil- 
dren, the latter receiving the self-same provisions for their tuition as 
the former.” 
In his annual report for 1887 to the Governor he says: “There has 
been a steady growth of interest throughout the State in the public 
schools, a constant advance in their efficiency, while a most health- 
ful esprit de corps animates the teachers as a rule, a result of which is 
that much better work has been accomplished. Patrons are becoming 
more identified with the schools and manifest a deep and lively inter- 
est in their encouragement and success. - 
“Tt can be safely said there are but few children who live in isolated 
places now in the State to whom the door of the school is not opened 
without fee or hinderance, of any race or condition of the population, 
and there is every reason for believing there are comparatively very few 
of the youth of school age who are not able to read. 
* * * * * * * 
“¢ While the people of Florida may congratulate themselves upon their 
school system, there are localities where great room exists for improve- 
ments and progress, but I find the spirit and desire for such advance- 
ment present with all concerned, and I have no fear but in a short time 
these counties will move upon the line and take their places in the front 
rank. 
“The increase in the number of schools is very gratifying, also the © 
increase in the number,of teachers employed. New and neat, comfort- 
able school-houses have been built all over the State, new and modern 
improved sittings have been supplied, and much closer attention is given 
in many parts of the State to the hygiene, ventilation, and light of the 
school-room and grounds.” 
SCHOOL OFFICERS AND THEIR DUTIES. 
The State Superintendent of Public Instruction, who was formerly ap- 
pointed by the Governor with the consent of the Senate, is now elected.
-P-A-G-E-24
  22 HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN FLORIDA. 
quadrennially by the qualified voters of the State. He is required to 
have the oversight, management, and charge of all matters pertaining 
to the public schools, school buildings, grounds, furniture, libraries, 
. text-books, and apparatus; to furnish school officers with the necessary 
blanks for official returns; to provide plans and specifications for con- 
structing and furnishing school buildings; to call meetings of county 
superintendents and other school officers; to grant certificates to. teach- 
ers, and fix the grades and standards of qualifications ; to apportion to 
each county its share! of the school funds of the State; to decide ques- 
tions of appeal, or refer the same to the Board of Education; and also to 
preserve educational and historical documents and specimens of natural 
history. : 
The State Board of Hducation is a corporate body, with full power to 
perform all corporate acts for educational purposes. It is composed of 
the Governor, Secretary of State, Attorney-General, State Treasurer, and 
State Superintendent of Public Instruction,—the Governor being presi- 
dent and. the Superintendent of Public Instruction, secretary. It has 
charge of the school lands and school funds of the State; to it is in- 
trusted the organization of the State University; it audits the accounts 
of the Superintendent, removes subordinate officers; and to it the Su- 
perintendent refers questions and appeals. It has also a co-operative 
power in the organization of the départment of instruction for the dif- 
fusion of knowledge throughout the State. 
Each county board of public instruction, of which the county superin- 
tendent is secretary and agent, is also a body corporate, and may take 
and hold real and personal property for educational purposes. It has 
charge of all school property in the county; locates and maintains 
schools when needed; examines candidates, and grants teachers’ cer- 
tificates which are valid in the county. 
The county superintendent, who is now chosen by the people, is “ the 
necessary agent between the State Superintendent and the county 
schools, and in his hands are the details of the whole organization. 
He is the medium through which all the operations of the entire system 
are carried on.” He must familiarize himself with the needs of all the 
schools in the county, confer with and aid the teachers in their work, 
advise with the patrons of each school about the selection of suitable 
persons for trustees, over whom also his supervision extends. He is 
required to visit the schools in the county at Jeast once during each 
term, and to him is often delegated by the county board the examina- 
tion of teachers and other duties belonging to said board. 
District trustees are appointed by the county boards, and have like 
charge and responsibility within their narrower spheres. It is their

according to the number of children of school age, but the county boards apportion 
according to the average attendance of pupils between the ages of six and twenty- 
one years. By law of February, 1885, the tax collector pays over to the county 
treasurer the “mill tax,” to be disbursed with the other school funds.

duty to visit the schools within their jurisdiction at least once in each 
month, and make quarterly reports to the county superintendent of their 
condition and efficiency; to co-operate with the teacher in maintaining 
order, and to suspend or expel pupils for misconduct. Usually a single 
school selects three trustees, but ofttimes but one, and for. groups of 
schools from two to five trustees are sometimes appointed. Their ap- 
pointment is made on the recommendation of patrons, and their term 
of office cannot exceed four years.! 
In choosing teachers, whenever the selection is not made By the 
trustees, it is customary to give notice to the patrons of the school that 
an election for that purpose is to be held. The candidate who receives 
the most votes is selected, unless he or she is found to lack the requisite 
qualifications. In cases where differences arise between school officers 
and teachers the matters in dispute are submitted to arbitration, or an 
appeal is taken to the county board, from which an appeal may be made 
to the State Board. The authority to grant teachers’ certificates is 
vested in the State Board, Superintendent of Public Instruction, county 
boards, and county superintendents when authorized by county boards. 
The certificates received from the county boards are valid for one year 
in the county in which they are granted. Certificates issued by the 
State Superintendent are of three grades, and are valid in any part ot 
the State for the time specified therein. A diploma from a normal col- 
lege confers equal privileges and power. The laws of Florida require 
that “teachers licensed by State or county authorities must teach de- 
portment and morals, and must inculcate the principles of truth, hon- 
' esty, and patriotism, and the practice of every Christian virtue, and 
they may give instruction one half-day in each week in some branches 
of needle-work and manual labor.” 
HE EDUCATION OF THE FREEDMEN. 
Among the first agencies employed in the effort to educate the freed- 
men were two which were under the control of colored people in the 
Northern States, and were known as the African Civilization Society, 
and the Home Missionary Society of the African M. E. Church. These 
societies established schools at different points in the Southern States, 
a few of which were opened in Florida, and were of much value in lay- 
ing the foundation for the education of the colored race. Other north- 
ern societies had their representatives here, the New York branch of 
the American Freedmen’s Union Commission being foremost. Through 
these different agencies about half of the colored schools of this period   
1 According to the Constitution of 1886, ‘‘the Legislature may provide for the divis- 
ion of any county or counties into convenient school districts; and for the election 
biennially of three school trustees, who shall hold their office for two years, and who 
shall have the supervision of all the schools within the district.” It may provide, 
also, for the levying of a limited district school-tax whenever the qualified electors 
who pay a tax on real or personal property shall vote in favor of such levy. ‘Any 
incorporated town or city may constitute a school district.”
-P-A-G-E-26
24 HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN FLORIDA. 
were sustained. Nearly as many more were taught by freed persons 
who had acquired a little learning in their bondage, and were anxious 
to elevate the condition of theirrace. Inall,some thirty colored schools 
were in successful operation at the close of 1865. In January, 1866, a 
bill was introduced into the Legislature providing for the education of 
the children of the freedmen, and levying a tax of one dollar each upon 
“call male persons of color between the ages of 21 and 45” years, and a tui- 
tion fee of fifty cents a month to be collected from each pupil. As soon 
as this became a law, a commissioner was appointed by the Governor 
with authority to organize colored schools, and enlist in his work the 
co-operation of all good citizens. This officer was everywhere welcomed 
and aided by the planters of the State; and during the first year he 
organized twenty day schools and thirty night schools. The latter 
were intended specially for adults, who often formed weird groups as 
they studied their books around the changing and uncertain light of 
the pine fire. There were enrolled in these schools 2,726 pupils, and, in 
addition, as many as 2,000 were thought to be receiving private instruc- 
tion. In this movement for the education of the freedmen Florida is 
believed to have taken precedence of all the other Southern States. 
During 1866 and 1867 the number of colored schools rapidly increased. 
The freedmen, in many instances, erected school-houses at their own 
expense, and heartily seconded the action of the Legislature. And just 
at this point the Freedmen’s Bureau proved itself the efficient friend 
and ally of the colored people. This it did, principally, by aiding in 
the promotion of “school societies,” whose object was to acquire by 
gift or purchase the perfect title to eligible lots of ground for school 
purposes. Each of these lots, not less than an acre in extent, was to be 
vested in a board of trustees. The Bureau also supplied lumber and 
other materials necessary to the construction of school buildings. This 
work was ably seconded by many landed proprietors, who furnished 
school lots and otherwise rendered moral and material support. But this 
prosperity was soon checked by reason of the “ hard times,” and the un- 
settled political condition of the State which followed after the War. 
For the four years from 1865 to 1869 the largest number of schools was 
seventy-one and the largest number of teachers sixty-four. Of the 
teachers one-half were white. The average number of pupils in attend- 
ance was thought to be about 2,000. The studies were “ the alphabet, 
easy reading, advanced reading, writing, geography, arithmetic, and 
higher branches. The cost of these schools was reported to be, for 1867, 
$21,000, and for 1868, $19,200, of which amounts $600 were contributed 
each year by the freedmen. At a later period we find the Freedmen’s 
Bureau rendering aid by paying a rental of ten dollars each on seventy- 
five school-houses, which were scattered through nine counties. In 
reality this money was devoted to the payment of teachers’ salaries. 
In the common school law of 1869 no reference is made to the com- 
plexion of the children for whom it was framed, and henceforth it be-

came the business of the State to see that equal school privileges were 
accorded to the two races. That progress among the colored peo- 
ple was for many years slow is evident from the annual school reports. 
The teachers employed were largely men and women of their own race, 
who, having had very inadequate opportunities for education, often 
brought the schools into disrepute. But, as the years passed, one im- 
provement fgllowed another, until, as early as 1878, the Superintendent 
reports that the colored people expressed themselves satisfied that jus- 
tice had been done them. ‘To-day their children are taught in separate 
schools, but they have the same help from the school funds, the same 
supervision, and are subject to the same regulations as those of the 
whiterace. Teachers’ institutes and normal schools have been provided 
for both, but it is yet too soon to expect that in general the qualifica- 
tions of the colored man will compare favorably with those of the white 
man. As the former is still the teacher of the colored children, these 
must to a certain extent suffer loss. It is to be hoped, however, and 
from the superior advantages now offered to colored teachers it is fair to 
conjecture, that this inequality will ere long be remedied. 
Secondary Colored Schools—Lincoln Academy at Tallahassee and 
Union Academy at Gainesville were the first schools established with 
the view of furnishing instruction to colored youth in advanced studies. 
Some time after their organization an appeal was made to the agent of 
the Peabody Fund to contribute to their support. This was granted, 
and at first $300 was given annually to each academy, but on the con- 
dition that it should be used principally for the training of teachers. 
After 1879 the amount was increased to $400, and this, or the former 
sum, continued to be donated for many years. In 1881 Lincoln Academy 
had an efficient corps of teachers, consisting of a principal and four as- 
sistants, with two hundred and fifty pupils, and the school year ex- 
tended through nine months. 
The Legislature of 1886 ordered the establishment of a normal col- 
lege for colored youth. This was opened in Tallahassee in 1887. Its 
history will be given in connection with the normal college for whites. 
Probably the best equipped colored school in Florida is the public 
school in Jacksonville. In addition to its regular work an industrial 
department has been recentlyadded. This was brought aboutas follows: 
During 1887, through the earnest efforts of the State Superintendent, 
seconded by the county board of Duval County and the colored people 
of the City of Jacksonville, the necessary steps were taken to secure 
from the agent of the Slater Fund an annual appropriation of $1,000 to 
be used for the teaching of the industrial arts. Through the commend- 
able enterprise of the colored people a suitable building was speedily 
erected on the grounds of the graded school above referred to, and this 
was ‘opened for instruction in October a year ago. “Hight sets of 
wood-working tools were procured, work benches built, and everything 
in readiness.: A teacher was employed, a white man, a practical archi-

tect and draughtsman, and mechanic and builder, and of excellent 
character and qualification. Instruction in the nature and use of the 
various tools, and in the working of wood was commenced for the boys 
on the first floor; and the girls were taken to the second floor, where 
needle-work, cutting, darning, and other needful work of the kind are 
taught, and where it is designed that cooking, laundry work, and other 
things qualifying the good housewife shall be taught.” To hours each 
day, so appointed as not to interfere with his studies in the school, 
are spent in this way by each pupil, and the results have already been 
most satisfactory. This, it is hoped, will be but the beginning of the 
adoption of industrial training in the schools of the State. 
Cookman Institute— A normal and biblical school for colored students.—- 
This Institute was founded and is sustained by the Freedmen’s Aid 
Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church. Its mission is set forth in 
the following language: “The public schools need a better class of 
teachers, and the pulpits a more- intelligent ministry. * * * Cook- 
man Institute supplies a great want of many of the colored people whose 
future largely depends upon our efforts. We have enlarged our plans 
to meet the demand and hope to fill teachers’ positions and pulpits with 
more efficient workmen.” The president of the school says: ‘“ Our grad- © 
uates honor themselves in their success in life, and show what education 
will do for the people when extended courses of study are pursued. The 
lawyer, the doctor, the minister, comes to be a man of power when he 
avails himself of such facilities for study.” 
The school, which is open to both sexes, was founded in 1872, in Jack- 
sonville, and had as its object the education and elevation of the needy 
and neglected masses among the freed people. Since its founding it 
has made a great advance in the quality of the instruction given and 
in its courses of study. The growth of its material interests has been 
no less pleasing. Beginning in a “little old church,” it finds itself 
to-day in a commodious brick building, free of debt, which is capable 
of accommodating 50 boarders and 150 day pupils. ‘The school year 
continues through nearly seven months, viz, from the second week in 
October to the close of April. The number of pupils in attendance 
during the year 1886-87 in the academic and normal departments was 
167. The courses ef study seem well adapted to the needs of the pupils. 
» There is a thorough course in English, a course in history, and a four 
years’ course in the following branches: In mathematics, ending with 
the sixth book in geometry ; in Latin, in which the most advanced au- 
thors read are Cicero and Virgil; and in descriptive and physical 
geography, to which latter are to be added the primary principles of 
botany, geology, mineralogy, and natural history. Besides these studies 
there are in the curriculum political economy, pedagogy, mental science, 
philosophy, and rhetoric. The necessary expenses for tuition and board 
are very small, and none who have an ambition to obtain an education 
ought to feel debarred on this account. The president, Rev. 8. B. Dar-
-P-A-G-E-29
  TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. Ft 
nell, has been at the head of the Institute during the whole of its 
history, and deserves much credit for his wise management of its affairs. 
There are seven others associated with him in the board of instruction. 
A college for colored youth has also been established, by the Bap- 
tist Missionary Society of the North, at Live Oak, in Savannah County, 
which is said to be doing good work. Besides its aim to furnish a lit- 
erary education, it insists that its students shall pursue an industrial 
course of study. * 
The Congregational Church has interested itself in a like work, and 
has established near Lake City the “Florida Normal and Industrial ~ 
College.” This school was opened in 1886, and a colored man placed at 
its head. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
The training of teachers is now recognized as one of the most im- 
portant educational agencies in the State. Since the organization in 
1879 of the first teachers’ institute they have rapidly grown in favor, 
and their beneficent effects are seen in a greatly improved corps of 
teachers, whose laudable ambition is “ to excel in everything that tends 
to make a real teacher.” Generous appropriations have been made by 
the Legislatures to defray the expenses incident to holding the insti- 
tutes, and the State Superintendent has, since 1880, visited annually 
many of the counties and personally organized and conducted them. 
In February, 1886, a State Teachers’ Institute was held and a State 
association organized. At the Florida Chautauqua, held each year since 
1885 at De Funiak Springs, much profitable instruction has been given 
to a large body of the teachers of the State. The subjects have related 
to the most important methods of teaching, and the lecturers have been 
some of the most eminent men who to-day adorn the teachers’ profes- 
sion. 
In June, 1887, the State Superintendent organized a corps of five in- 
structors, who for a period of sixteen weeks successfully conducted 
teachers’ institutes in thirteen counties. At the head of these instruct- 
ors was Prof. H. N. Felkel, and in his report to the Superintendent he 
states that their work “ has resulted in giving a new impetus to educa- 
tional thought in our State;” that the citizens generally are disposed 
to foster it, and that “the trustees and patrons by attending these in- 
stitutes will better understand what a teacher’s qualifications should 
be, and in this way it will come that only true merit will be recognized. 
* * * These teachers receive in the institutes suggestions on the most 
approved methods of instruction, and are thus enabled to incorporate 
them in their work. In the second place, by this means, a uniformity 
in school-room work is secured throughout the State, a fact which can 
but result in benefit. And lastly, but most important perhaps, these 
meetings attract attention to the schools and thereby stimulate that in- 
terest in education which is so much to be desired, and which could 
not be accomplished so well in any other way.” :

NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
In taking the initiatory steps for the training of teachers Florida was 
greatly assisted by the Peabody Fund. In 1877, through aid from this 
fund, provision was made for three scholarships in the normal depart- 
ment of the Nashville University. Two years later five scholarships 
were added, and in 1886 the number was increased to ten, each scholar- 
ship drawing an annual income of $200. These were for the benefit of 
white students. In addition aid was offered to schools that would 
maintain a normal department. In the course of ten years $52,650 were 
donated by the agent of the Peabody Fund to schools in Florida, a large 
portion of which was definitely set apart for the training of teachers.! 
All schools receiving this aid were required to have an enrolment of a 
hundred pupils, with a teacler for every fifty. The average attendance 
must be not less than eighty per cent. of the whole number enrolled, and 
the school year must continue through ten months. 
The first normal class for whites appears to have been formed in the 
East Florida Seminary at the close of 1879 or beginning of 1880. In 
. the latter year the seminary was organized as a State normal school. 
It offered free tuition to one student from each legislative district- In 
1831-82 forty students were enrolled in the normal course. In 1883-84 
there were normal departments in both the East and West Florida 
Seminaries, besides the normal schools for colored teachers at Tallahas- 
see and Gainesville. 
A very flourishing Normal School and Business Institute has been 
established at White Springs, in Hamilton County, of which Professor 
J. L. Skipworth is president. This is an incorporated institution (act 
of June, 1887), and it has already an attendance of one hundred and 
fifty pupils. 
Normal classes are now conducted in a large number of the colleges 
and secondary schools, and instruction is given in the most improved 
methods by experienced teachers. At the session of the Legislature 
in 1887 provision was made for the organization of two normal col- 
leges—one for each race. In October of the same year these colleges 
were opened and put in operation, the one for white students at De 
Funiak, in Walton County, and the one for colored students at Talla- 
hassee. The president of the former, Prof. H. N. Felkel, writes that 
“ the initial term began October 5, 1887, with an attendance of sixteen 
students. There were accessions from time to time until, at the end of the 
fifth month, there were fifty-seven matriculates. * * * There are 
  
1In 1884 the sum of $1,500 was given from this fund on the condition that it 
should be expended upon teachers’ institutes and public schools. But at the meeting 
of the trustees of the fund in 1885 the usual donation to Florida was denied ‘upon 
the alleged ground that the State refused to pay either principal or interest on cer- 
tain funds held by the trustees, said to be bonds of the State of Florida.” 
A full statement of the position taken by the State is given in the report of Hon. 
Henry R. Jackson to the Trustees of the Peabody Fund, a copy of which appeared in , 
the ‘Annual Trade Number, 1886,” of the Jacksonville Times-Union.

at present three instructors—a president and two’assistants.” A year 
later it is reported to have seventy-five students and to be doing most 
excellent work. 
The president of the colored normal, Prof. T. De 8. Tucker, gives the 
following history of the college: ‘ Up to the assembling of the conven. 
tion of 1885, which framed the present organic law of the State, there 
was a growing conviction in the public mind that the colored people of 
the State should be given the advantages of an education higher than 
that furnished in the common schools. This found expression in an 
article in the Constitution providing for the establishment of a normal 
school fortherace. * * * The benefits of the institution are open to 
persons of both sexes ranging from sixteen yearsand upwards. The first 
session began on the 3d of October last with an attendance of fifteen schol- 
ars, who had successfully passed the examination requisite to admission. 
There are now (February, 1888) enrolled thirty-nine,! with an average 
daily attendance of thirty. About half as many as the enrolled number 
have been rejected, owing to failure to pass the examination. In every - 
respect the school promises splendid results. The race for whom it is 
established not only prize it, but have already learned to esteem it asa 
potent factor to their elevation. The scholars are delighted with the 
facilities for higher training which they enjoy, and are making very 
commendable progress in their studies. As yet we have representatives 
from only six counties, but the indications are that by next session we 
shall have students from nearly every section of the State.” 
The Superintendent in his report speaks very highly of the heads of 
these colleges, and says of the latter that he understands fully “the | 
needs of his race.” 
The course “ consists of two years in the art of teaching and impart- 
ing instruction.” Diplomas are granted to the graduates, who are thus 
made licentiates of instruction. ‘These diplomas constitute life certifi- 
cates of the first class in the State of Florida. An academic, or prepar- 
atory course, which is the same in both institutions, is also given, so 
that students who have not been well prepared in their academic work 
may be thoroughly prepared to enter upon the college course.” 
"The studies in the colored normal college, though equivalent, differ 
in some respects from those pursued in the normal at De Funiak. Be- 
sides being qualified educationally to enter upon school work, the grad- 
uates from both colleges will be well versed in improved methods of - 
teaching, in hygiene, in ventilating, lighting, and beautifying the school- 
room, and in “making it a place to win the esteem and affection of the 
pupil.and command the respect of the patrons.” 
Both of these schools have been supplied with modern furniture, “with 
globes, atlases, blackboards, and all other requirements for first-class 
work. A new building has been erected for the use of the colored nor- 
mal, a simple Grecian temple, cruciform in shape, having three distinct

departments for study and recitation. A college building was furnished 
the white school at De Funiak.” 
ACADEMIES AND HIGH SCHOOLS. 
At the close of the War, or soon thereafter, most of the old acade- 
mies, which were formerly managed by boards of five to nine trustees, 
ceased to exist. Subsequently some of them were revived and con- 
ducted as free schools, though not always with success. Jefferson 
Academy, at Monticello, which survived the War, adopted the free school 
system and so continued for ten years (being aided by the Peabody 
Fund), but in 1877 it reverted to the old system of tuition fees. 
In 1875 there were reported to be twelve high schools, aside from 
the East and West Florida Seminaries. Their curriculum embraced 
“ Greek, Latin, chemistry, natural philosophy, astronomy, physiology, 
botany, and the higher branches of arithmetic.” In the annual report 
for 1878 the number of high schools is placed at fifteen, It is doubtful 
if more than one or two of these compared favorably with schools of 
like name in the older States. Exception should be made in the case 
of the high school at Jacksonville. This was established in 1877, and 
has now an enrolment of about one hundred pupils. It has two courses 
of study, an English and a classical, each extending through four 
years, and in the quality of instruction, and in the advanced studies 
pursued, it is searcely inferior to the colleges of the State. Still, it does 
not affect a college course. The most advanced branches taugkt are, 
in mathematics, trigonometry; in Latin, Virgil’s Au‘neid and Cicero’s 
Orations ; in Greek, Xenophon’s Anabasis and Homer’s Iliad. It hasa 
course of one year in history and of two years in French. To all who 
complete either course of study and obtain an average of excellence 
equal to 75 per cent, diplomas are awarded. Two honors are also as- 
signed, and two medals awarded each year for excellence in scholar- 
ship and deportment. Free tuition is given to all pupils resident in the 
county; others are admitted by the payment of forty dollars annually. 
PUBLIC SCHOOL LANDS. 
In the famous Ordinance of 1787, setting ‘apart “ Section 16 of every 
township” for the maintenance of public schools, there is this memora- 
ple declaration: ‘‘Religion, morality, and knowledge being necessary to good 
government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education 
. shall be forever encowraged.” By this ordinance there was also set apart 
not more than two complete townships of land in each State, to be given 
perpetually for the purposes of a university. 
Besides the sixteenth-section lands which Florida received, Congress 
enacted in 1823 “ that an entire township in each of the districts of east 
and. west Florida shall be reserved from sale for the use of a seminary 
of learning, to be located by the Secretary of the Treasury.” Again, in | 
1845, when Florida became a State, Congress voted “ two entire town-
-P-A-G-E-33
  
HISTORY OF THE SEMINARIES AND COLLEGES. 31 
ships of land in addition to the two townships already reserved,” in 
consideration “of the concessions made by the State of Florida in re- 
spect to the public lands.” By act of Congress, in 1841, five hundred 
thousand acres of the public lands were added to her school fund. In 
1862 Congress appropriated to the several States thirty thousand acres 
of the public lands for each Senator and Representative in Congress, 
for the purpose of establishing a fund for the endowment of Semone 
ural colleges. 
In the Constitution of Florida adopted in 1865, we find under “Edu- 
eation” the following: 
“Sno. 1. The proceeds of all lands for the use of schools and: a semi- 
nary or seminaries of learning shall be and remain a perpetual fund, the 
interest of which, together with all moneys accrued from any other 
source applicable to the same object, shall be irrecoverably appropri- 
ated to the use of schools and seminaries of learning, respectively, 
and to no other purpose. 
“Sxo. 2. The General Assembly shail take such measures as may be 
necessary to preserve from waste or damage all lands so granted or ap- 
propriated for the purpose of education.” 
Altogether there have been donated.out of the public domain in 
Florida, for the benefit of common schools, 908,503 acres; for the endow- 
ment of a State college or university, 92.160: acres; and for the endow- 
ment of two seminaries, 85,714 acres. 
HISTORY OF THE SEMINARIES AND COLLEGES. 
“The men who laid the foundations of our institutions were not 
guilty of the absurdity of supposing that any system of elementary edu- 
cation, however excellent, could long thrive, unless there were vitally 
joined with it, as part of the same system, provisions for a — and 
generous higher education.”! 
The first step taken by Florida towards the establishment of schools 
for higher education is found in the act of the Legislature January 24, 
1851, in which it is provided that “ Two seminaries of learning shall so 
established, one upon the east, the other upon the west side of the 
Suwannee River, the first purpose of which shall be the instruction of 
persons, both male and female, in the art of teaching all the various 
branches that pertain to a good common school education; and next, to 
give instruction in the mechanic arts, in husbandry, and agricultura} 
chemistry, in the fundamental laws, and in what regards the rights and 
duties of citizenship.” “ Lectures on chemistry, comparative anatomy, 
astronomy, and the mechanic arts, agricultural chemistry, and on any 
other science or any branch of literature that the board of education 
may direct, may be delivered to those attending the seminary in such 
manner, at such time, and on such conditions as the board of education 
may prescribe. g

    32 HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN FLORIDA. 
This act was followed by others in 1853, 1857, 1861, 1862, and 1866—all 
having reference to provisions for these schools which were established, 
the one at Tallahassee, the other at Ocala,! and which continued up to 
the formation of the State Constitution of 1868, and practically for a dec- 
ade following, the only public educational institutions of higher grade 
than common schools. In 1862 the Governor was authorized to create 
a board of education consisting of six persons besides the county super- 
intendent of schools, who was to be secretary and member. ew officio. 
This law has since been modified and now reads substantially as follows: 
There shall be appointed by the Governor, by and with the consent of the 
Senate, seven persons, not more than three of whom shall be residents of 
the town or county in which the seminary is located, for each of the 
two seminaries of learning as members of a board of education, who 
shall hold their office for four years, and the members of said board of 
education shall annually elect one of their number as secretary, and one 
as president. The treasurers of the counties in which the seminaries are 
situated shall be, respectively, by virtue of their office, treasurers of the 
board, and each shall give such security for the faithful performance of 
his duty as the board for which he is treasurer may require of him. 
Among the powers intrusted to this board were the following: The 
appointment of principal and assistants; the establishment of an ex- 
perimental school in connection with the seminary; the purchasing of 
grounds and the erection of suitable buildings, and furnishing them with 
apparatus, books, and all necessary appliances, and the providing in. 
struments of husbandry and mechanical tools. They were to establish 
rules and regulations for the admission of pupils; appoint annually a © 
board of visitors, who were to report to the State superintendent; pro- 
vide courses of lectures upon chemistry, comparative anatomy, etc., and 
upon any science or branch of literature that they might think best 
adapted to advance the interests of the seminary. The control of all 
funds belonging to the seminary was placed in their hands, and no 
money was to be drawn from the treasury except “upon the warrant of 
the comptroller, issued in pursuance of a certificate of the board of 
education, signed by their secretary and countersigned by their presi- 
dent.” Other and enlarged powers were conferred upon this board, 
making it a body corporate and empowered to ‘purchase, have, hold, 
possess, and enjoy” goods, chattels, and effects of every kind, and grant, 
alien, sell, invest, and dispose of the same; ‘provided the same be not 
repugnant to the Constitution and laws of this State or of the United 
States.” In brief, to this board was intrusted the supervision of ~ 
entire interests of the seminary. 
It is made the duty of the county commissioners of each county to se- 
lect the candidates for admission to the seminaries. The number of 
these is in proportion to its representatives in the State Assembly, each 
county being ‘‘entitled to as many free students as it has members in

the tower house of the Legislature.” Other pupils are admitted at a 
reasonable rate of tuition.! The State Superintendent is required te 
visit each seminary at least once a year, and embody in his annual re- 
port to the Governor a statement of its condition, its “prospects, prog- 
ress, and usefulness,” in order that this may be laid before the Legis- 
lature at each regular session thereof. 
EAST FLORIDA SEMINARY. 
In 1848 the Governor of Florida requested the citizens within each 
county east of the Suwannee River to say how much in lands, build- 
ings, or funds they would give to secure the location of the seminary 
within their bounds. In reply, the citizens of Marion County agreed 
to give sixteen lots, located in the city of Ocala, witha building erected 
thereon, and $1,600 in money. Accordingly, by act of 1852 Ocala was 
selected, and the seminary was opened in the following year. Here it 
remained until 1866, when by act of Legislature it was removed to 
Gainesville The object designed by this removal seems hardly to 
have been attained, for the fact still remained that the income of the 
seminary fund was expended in maintaining a local high school, the 
counties within the legal territory of the seminary very rarely taking 
advantage of the privilege accorded to them of sending pupils free of 
charge for tuition. 
Superintendent Edwin P. Cater, A. M., who has for many years been 
the efiicient head of the seminary, makes the following contribution to 
its history : 
“During the period of Florida’s territorial organization the General 
Government donated two townships of land for the purpose of estab- 
lishing a seminary of learning, and, when the Territory became a State, 
two other townships were added to the original donation. * * * 
About three-fifths of these lands have been.sold and the proceeds 
($91,000) invested in State bonds, the interest of these bonds consti- 
tuting the present income of the two seminaries. * * * *Up to the 
year 1877 the seminary was little more than a public school for Gaines- 
ville. At that time certain improvements were inaugurated, the school 
was thoroughly graded, and the foundation laid for steady progress in 
all respects. ‘The age of the students ranged from four to twenty-four 
years, and the range of studies was correspondingly great. Since then 
the policy has been to gradually drop the lower classes and in the same   
1See below in regard to tuition in the West Florida Seminary. 
*The Constitutional convention of 1885 decreed that Ocala should be reimbursed 
for the damage to her interests occasioned by the removal of the seminary, and the 
Legislature of 1887, in order to settle and pay this claim, made an appropriation of 
$5,400, and directed that it should be used ‘‘ for the erection of public school build- 
ings and the purchase of apparatus necessary for carrying on graded schools.” One 
thousand six hundred dollars of this appropriation was voted by the town of Ocala 
to assist in defraying the expense of a building for the colored school, now known as 
the Howard Academy. The balance is invested, and is to be used iti maintaining a 
high school for white pupils.

proportion raise the age limit, so that at present no students are re- 
ceived under thirteen years of age. The number of classes is now lim- 
ited to four, and the course of study embraces the following branches, 
viz: In mathematics, arithmetic, commercial arithmetic, algebra, book- 
keeping, and plane geometry ; in science, descriptive geography, his- 
tory of the United States, physiology, physical geography, elementary 
physics, and elementary chemistry ; in English, spelling, reading, gram- 
mar, elocution (including the study of authors), and rhetoric; in ancient 
languages, a three years’ course in Latin and a two years’ course in 
Greek. In writing and drawing there are daily lessons. There are 
also in the curriculum, as stated in the annual calendar, general history, 
plane trigonometry and surveying, geology, and botany. 
“There are three examinations during the annual session: (1) The 
entrance examination at the beginning of the session, to determine the 
classification of candidates for matriculation ; (2) the intermediate ex- 
amination of classes at the close of the first term; (3) the final exami- 
nation at the close of the session. 
“Since 1883 the school has been strictly military in its organization 
and government, and the military department has been under the 
charge of an officer of the United States Army, detailed for that pur. 
pose by the Secretary of War. At the same time the military duties 
of the students are not allowed to interfere with their academic work, 
but all drills, ete., occur in the afternoon at the close of the regular 
school work. The hours spent at Northern military schools in the 
heated drill-rooms are here spent in the open air, with all nature’s re- 
sources supplementing the art of man. 
“The seminary has a full equipment of infantry arms and accoutre- 
ments; and also twothree-inch steel rifled guns for instruction in artillery 
drill. : 
“ This institution is a school, not a college. The design of its course of 
study is to prepare boys and ycung men for admission into university 
classes, or for entrance at once upon the active duties of life. 
“Of the twenty-eight counties which constitute its legal territory, 
twenty-one have representatives now in school. 
“ Up to 1883 the building consisted of a wooden structure badly de- 
signed and poorly constructed. There are now two buildings, one a 
handsome brick edifice, of the most approved style of school architect- 
ure, the other of wood, 197 feet long and 92 feet wide, built in the form 
of a quadrangle, enclosing an open court 150 feet long and 50 feet wide. 
This latter building is the barracks, or dormitory, and all teachers and 
non-resident male students are required to live in it. 
“The seminary is entitled by law to grant diplomas and to confer de- 
grees. On completion of the English course the English diploma is given, 
and on completion of the other courses, viz, the commercial, classical, and 
scientific, appropriate diplomas are given. In 1882, when these diplo- 
mas were first granted, there were three graduates; in 1883, five; in 1884, 
one; in 1885, four; in 1886, seven; 1m 1587, seven; and in 1888, eleven.

“The seminary has maintained for a number of years a normal depart- 
ment, the State making a special appropriation therefor. In this any 
white person of sufficient educational attainments and sixteen years of 
age, by agreeing to make teaching a profession, has been granted free 
tuition in classes which were independent of the regular seminary 
course. As the new Constitution of the State provides for ia tie 
normal schools this department has been discontinued. 
“In consequence of the increased requirements for admission there 
has been a marked reduction in the number of pupils in attendance at 
he seminary, but full compensation in the age and advancement of 
those enrolled. During the past academic year—the 35th since its 
founding—the average of the actual daily attendance was 75.30, and 
the whole number enrolled ninety-three. The average age of the sey- 
enty-nine male students was seventeen years, and of the fourteen 
female students sixteen years. 
“Notwithstanding the epidemic of 1888, which delayed for two 
months the opening of the school year of 1888-89, the superintendent 
reports in March, 1889, that the institution is prospering beyond their 
expectations; that there is a slight decrease in the number enrolled, 
but that among the students there are representatives from South Car- 
olina and Texas. 
“In the academic building there is a room devoted to the library.! 
This now contains between 800 and 1,000 volumes, all said to be works 
of solid merit.” 
The board of instruction and government consists of seven members, 
who have proved themselves very efficient in their several departments. 
To the president the prosperity of theseminary is eminently due. Colonel 
Cater was born in Columbia, 8. C., and is a descendant on both ancestral 
lines from clergymen of the Presbyterian Church. Ie was graduated 
from Oglethorpe University, Georgia, in May, 1861, and a month later en- 
tered the Confederate army, in which he served until theclose of the War, 
From that time on he has devoted his life to teaching, meeting with uni- 
form success, first as principal for four years of academies in Tennessee, 
and then for seven years at the head of higher or collegiate institutions 
in Georgia. In June, 1887, he was called to the principalship of the 
East Florida Seminary, which position he has since held. Throughout 
his career as a teacher he has so distinguished himself as to win from — 
the most eminent friends of each institution over which he has presided   
1 There has been and is still a great lack of good public libraries in Florida. In 
1850 there were no college libraries, no student libraries, only one public school li- 
*brary with a list of 200 volumes, and two State libraries with an aggregate collection 
of 4,000 volumes. During the next twenty years a gratifying advance was made, so 
that in 1872 there were reported to be seventy-five public libraries with 25,374 vol- 
umes, and one hundred and seventy-eight private libraries with 87,554 volumes. In 
Bowker’s Library List, published in 1887, the number of volumes in the public libra- 
ries is stated to be 26,660; but this publication eliminates minor libraries of under a 
thousand volumes.

the highest encomiums respecting his character, scholarship, and ability 
as a manager and disciplinarian. His most important work has been 
done in connection with the East Florida Seminary. He found it merely 
an ungraded public school without reputation, and miserably housed. 
It has now commodious and suitable buildings, and is patronized by the 
entire State; and, as the record shows, is doing excellent educational 
work. 
WEST FLORIDA SEMINARY.! 
On November 24, 1856, it was resolved by the board of trustees 
of the Florida Institute (owned by the city of Tallahassee) that the 
intendant address a letter to the President of the Senate and Speaker 
‘of the House of Representatives of the State of Florida, offering to the 
said Legislature on and in behalf of the city of Tallahassee $10,000 
as an inducement for the location of the State seminary in said city, the 
seminary edifice (then in use of the Florida Institute) with its appliances 
to be given at an appraised value, and the rest to be paid in money. 
The city also agreed to pay $2,000 annually for the tuition of the chil- 
dren of Tallahassee. 
The tender was made and accepted, and on the 27th of March, 1857, 
the property and school, known as the Florida Institute, was turned ' 
over to the board of education chosen for “the Seminary West of the 
Suwannee River.” On December 23, 1857, this board authorized the pur- 
chase of the lots adjoining the seminary property. The property above 
enumerated embraces about nineteen acres, on which there is a two- 
story brick building, the whole being worti about $10,000. 
Up to June 14, 1858, only males had received instruction. On that 
day it was resolved, “‘That the Board provide for the instruction of 
females from and after the 1st day of October next.” August 28, 1858, 
the board accepted a deed of conveyance from the president of Leon 
Female Academy of two lots in the north addition of the city of Talla- 
hassee, and the seminary has ever since maintained a female depart- 
ment. This department was conducted in the building just referred to, 
separately from the male department, until October, 1882, when the two 
were merged. From that date to the present time the males and females 
have been taught in the same building and classes. This “ Seminary 
West of the Suwanneg River” (popularly known as the West Florida 
Seminary) has been in operation from February, 1857, except that the 
male department was suspended about one year during 1862-63. Sup- 
ported by the interest from the seminary fund and a fund given by 
the city of Tallahassee, as also by tuition fees until 1869, it was’ 
able to offer good facilities for instruction, and did in fact for many 
years sustain an excellent local reputation. For some time after the 
War aid was given to it from the Peabody Fund, and occasionally, as 
ry is collated from a paper fur- 
nished me by its president, Col. George M. Edgar, LL. D.

would appear from the report of 1878, the county board of public in- 
struction contributed towards the payment of the teachers’ salaries. 
In 1877-78 there were one hundred and twenty students of both sexes 
in attendance, but in 1880, by reason of the increased requirements for 
admission, the number was greatly reduced. During the year 1883-84 
there was a corps of seven professors and seventy-four matriculated 
students, only eighteen of the latter being beneficiaries, who had been 
sent from seven counties within the legal territory. At that time the 
academic buildings were enlarged, new school furniture procured, and 
the appointments of the school in many ways improved. It was in the 
above named year that the West Florida Seminary was organized as. 
the literary college of the Florida University, but this coalition was of 
brief duration. 
“The assets of the seminary are as follows: $45,000 in bonds, draw- 
ing interest at the rate of 6 and 7 percent., and about $15,000in real es- 
tate. Besides this, it is the residuary legatee of the late Judge J. D. 
Westcott. It is not known yet what amount will be realized from this 
source, but I should say not less than $30,000. Six per cent. on that 
amount has been received the past year, and we expect to receive more 
nextyear. Further, the seminary owns a half interest (the East Florida 
Seminary owning the other half) in 30,000 acres of land, much of which 
is valued at $5 per acre. The institution may be safely estimated to be 
worth from $115,000 to $120,000. 'The $45,000 to which I refer is half of 
theproceeds from thesale of the seminary lands donated to the State by 
Congress in 1823 and 1845, of which grants 30,000 acres remain unsold. 
“or several years the institution did not flourish, but recently it has 
revived, and the attendance in 1887-88 was 50 per cent. greater than in 
the preceding year, viz: seventy-four pupils. It is expected that there 
will be a still greater increase in the near future. The appliances of the 
seminary for instruction are not adequate to its wants, but the manage- 
ment hope to be able soon to add to them. Tuition in the seminary is 
free to all-Florida youth. The institution has power to confer degrees, 
and its charter is ample in its provisions for the maintenance of a uni- 
versity. We have now two college classes and two high school classes.” 
Dr. Edgar was called to the presidency of the institution in August, 
1887, and from a report made by him to the Superintendent of Public 
Instruction in the ensuing December I extract the following : 
“After a careful examination into the condition of the seminary it 
seemed to me that the institution was neither subserving the main pur- 
poses for which it was established, nor was it, in a proper sense, organized. 
upon a ‘collegiate basis,’ as authorized by the act of 1861, though teach- 
ing a nominal collegiate course in connection with the common school 
branches. It appears, however, from the secretary’s books that the 
annuity of the institution had never been adequate to provide for effi- 
cient technical instruction in the mechanic arts and husbandry, and 
that instruction in pedagogies had only been maintained by legislative 
appropriations which the last Legislature discontinued.  
-P-A-G-E-42
  38 HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN FLORIDA. 
“Under these circumstances I recommended to the board of education 
to limit the scope of instruction in the seminary for the present to high 
school and collegiate courses, and, in view of the fact that in the past 
five years special schools have been founded for promoting technical 
training, to leave open the question of its development in the technical 
departments * * * and to discontinue training in the primary 
branches, for which ample provision is already made in all of the 
counties of the State. Further, desiring that the institution should be 
characterized by its high standard of instruction and graduation, rather 
than by any non-essential feature, like the military, * * * I recom- 
mended that this feature be not adopted for the present at least. The 
board of education adopted the above recommendation, and I accord- 
ingly outlined a high school course and two collegiate courses leading 
to appropriate degrees. 
“The board of education completed the reorganization of the institu- 
tion by the election of Prof. A. F. Lewis, A. M., of the College of New 
Jersey, Princeton, and of Miss Elizabeth Bangs, A. B., of the University 
of Michigan, as my associates,! teachers of superior qualifications and 
successful experience.” ‘ 
The buildings of the seminary are unpretentious and ill adapted to 
meet the wants of the school under its present management. Plans, 
however, have already been drawn, and it is proposed, with hopeful au- 
gury of success, to erect within the coming year (1889-90) two commo- 
dious and ornate buildings upon the present campus ; or, in lieu of that, 
to choose a new and more central site and build thereon. 
President Edgar, whose management has already given new life to 
the seminary and added many to the number of its friends, is a gradu- 
ate from the Virginia Military Institute, and has now for more than 
twenty years devoted himself to the teacher’s profession. Besides other 
prominent positions with which he has been honored, he was for some 
years the successful president of Oakland College, in Mississippi, and 
later of the Arkansas Industrial University. 
So satisfactory is the present management of the seminary, that 
within the past year the Governor of the State and the Superintendent 
of Public Instruction have taken occasion to express their good opinion 
of it, and to recommend the institution to the people of west Florida. 
The following, which is taken from the catalogue of 1888, gives an 
exhibit of the courses of study.and the work which the seminary hopes 
to accomplish : 
“Tn the collegiate department two courses are taught,—the classical 
course, leading to the degree of bachelor of arts (B. A.), and the liter- 
ary course, leading to the degree of bachelor of letters (B. Let.). 
“The classical course embraces Latin, Greek (or French and German), 
mathematics, English, history, philosophy, and natural science. 
“The literary course embraces Latin (or French and German), mathe- 
matics, English, history, philosophy, and natural science. 
1 Another instrnetor has since been added.
-P-A-G-E-43
  WEST FLORIDA SEMINARY. 30 
“In Latin the following authors, or their equivalents, are read: Caesar, 
Sallust, Cicero’s orations against Catiline, Cicero de Amicitia, Virgil, 
Livy, Tacitus, Horace, and Juvenal. 
“In Greek, Xenophon’s Anabasis, Lysias (three orations), Homer’s 
Iliad, Demosthenes, Plato’s Crito and Apology, and Sophocles. 
“In both Latin and Greek the grammar and idioms are carefully 
studied, frequent exercises are required in rendering English into Latin 
and Greek, and due prominence is given to the study of the Latin and 
Greek metres. 
“In teaching French and German the ‘ natural method’ is combined 
with the grammatical. Both oral and written translations are required, 
and frequent exercises given in translating English into these languages. 
The more difficult principles of the grammar are discussed only with 
advanced students. 
“The course in mathematics embraces algebra, geometry, plane and 
spherical trigonometry, surveying, mensuration, analytical geometry. 
Calculus will be substituted for other studies in the curriculum for those 
desiring it. 
“The aim in the department of English is to make the study of the 
language of disciplinary value ; to promote correct, clear, and elegant 
expression; to teach the science of discourse and correct “prinefplés of 
criticism; and to lead the student to a just appreciation of the richness 
of our iter ares 
“With this view, the drilling in grammar and analysis in the high 
school course is followed by the study of rhetoric, both as an art and 
science, of the masterpieces of. English literature, its history and 
growth; the whole being interspersed by frequent practical exercises 
requiring original investigation, comparison, and thought. 
“In history and political science the purpose is to study the moral, so- ~ 
cial, and political forces which have operated in the development of na- 
tional life, and to apply the lessons thus learned to the solution of the 
social problems of our time. Appropriate text-books in history, gov- 
ernment, and economic science form the basis of instruction, which must 
necessarily be amplified by lectures and reference to the larger works 
on these subjects and to standard reviews and other periodicals. _ 
“The department of philosophy embraces psychology, ethics, logic, 
and the history of philosophy. In the study of the mind, no theory or 
doctrine is urged for acceptance which is not based upor a philosophical 
induction from the facts of consciousness. The freest and fullest dis- 
cussion of opposing views is encouraged.” 
In natural science the aim is to give a good summary of the facts and 
principles of the leading sciences. The sciences of observation, such 
as physiology, zodlogy, and botany, are taught chiefly in the high school 
course, both because they are easily acquired by young students and to 
gain more time for the study of the more difficult sciences—physics, 
chemistry, astronomy, and geology—in the collegiate course.

In addition to these courses, drawing has recently been introduced 
as one of the regular studies of each class. 4 
An examination is held at the close of each term. All examinations 
are chiefly in writing, though oral illustrations and manipulations may 
be called for by the examiner to satisfy himself that a student under- 
stands his answers, and has a practical knowledge of the subject. For 
the present, the time required to take a degree will depend upon the 
stage of advancemént, aptitude, and diligence of the student. 
Besides the degrees of bachelor of arts and bachelor of letters to be 
conferred upon the students who complete the two regular courses, cer- 
tificates of proficiency will be conferred upon those who satisfactorily 
complete any one of the departments or schools. 
The following prizes are offered for the ensuing session: A gold medal 
to cost not less than $10 is offered to the student who shall attain to 
the highest grade in scholarship and deportment combined. A gold 
medal of equal value to the above is offered by the board of education 
to the student of each of the regular classes who shall attain to the 
highest average in his class after examination. 
Candidates for admission into the seminary must be well grounded 
in the branches usually embraced in the highest grade of the common 
schools. Allowances will be made for the differences in the standard 
of these schools, but it is the desire of the board of education to con- 
fine the teaching in the seminary, as far as possible, to high school and 
collegiate studies. 
The school year begins on the first Monday in October, and continues 
thirty-six weeks, being divided into two terms. 
THE STATE AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE. 
By act passed July 2, 1862, Congress appropriated to the several 
States “land scrip to the amount of 30,000 acres of the public lands 
for each Senator and Representative in Congress, on condition that 
within five years! each State or Territory claiming the’ benefit of the 
act proceed to the establishment of a college. The intent was that the 
lands thus donated should be sold and the proceeds invested in such a 
way as to form a permanent endowment. The object of the colleges to 
be established is thus set forth: “To teach such branches of learning 
as are related to agriculture and the mechanic arts, without excluding 
other scientific and classical studies, and including military tactics, in 
such way as the Legislatures of the States may respectively prescribe, 
in order to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial 
classes in the several pursuits and professions in life.” 
Rarely has Congress legislated more wisely. For twenty years this 
act has been of incalculable benefit to the youth of the nation. The 
schools established under it have been the “colleges of the people,”   
1 This condition appears to have been modified.
-P-A-G-E-45
  THE STATE AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE. 41 
since they are the natural outgrowth and completion of the free com- 
mon school system of the country, 
In 1870 the Legislature of Florida voted to establish an agricultural 
college under the provisions of this act. It provided for a board of 
trustees who should be authorized to claim and receive from the Secre- 
‘tary of the Interior the “land scrip” voted by Congress, and to “sell 
and assign this scrip, or locate and thereafter transfer and convey the 
lands,” and use ten per cent. of the proceeds from the sales for the pur- 
chase of a site for an experimental farm. The balance of the proceeds 
was to form a permanent fund, and the trustees were directed to invest 
it “in the stocks of the United States, or of some of the States of the 
Union, bearing an annual interest of not less than six per cent. on the 
par value.” The interest was to be applied to the purposes set forth in 
the statement of the design of the college. Neither prigicipal nor in- 
terest could be devoted to the purchase, erection, or repairs of any 
building, nor for any other purpose than that expressed in the design 
of establishment. The college was to be located as near the centre of 
the State as possible, and the trustees were required to secure by gift 
or purchase a tract of land of not less than 100 acres, “ to be used as 
an experimental farm, or for the location of workshops, or otherwise to 
promote the objects of the institution.” 
The president, professors, and superintendents of the college were to 
be chosen by the board of trustees, and they, with the secretary of the 
board, were to constitute the faculty of the college. Each county was 
to have the right to send as many students to the co!lege, who were to 
have free tuition, as it had representatives in the General Assembly; 
and these were to be selected by the county board of public instruction 
“from among the most advanced pupils in the common and high schools 
who shall present themselves as candidates.” The pupils selected must 
be “ those best qualified as to scholastic attainments, good health, and 
upright moral character.” Before admission to college they were, 
howeyer, to be re-examined and approved by the faculty. In case the 
county board failed to make selections, as the law required, pupils hold- 
ing high rank in the schools of the county could apply in person to the 
faculty for examination and admission. 
It was made the duty of the board of trustees to report annually to 
the Superintendent of Public Instruction, and this officer was required 
to transmit said report to all other colleges endowed by said act of Con- 
gress creating agricultural college lands. A copy also was required 
to be sent to the Secretary of the Interior, and one to each House of 
Congress. It was further provided that “the Legislature may add other 
departments of learning to this college when the endowments of such 
departments shall have been provided for;” and also that “the Jus- 
tices of the Supreme Court shall constitute an examining committee 
with power to investigate the affairs of the college and the corporation, 
and to appoint proxies to act in their stead.”
-P-A-G-E-46
  
42 HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN FLORIDA. 
In 1872, the Legislature made it the duty of each State Senator during 
his term of office to nominate and send one student from his senatorial 
district to the college, who should be entitled to receive the benefits of 
a full course of instruction without cost for tuition. 
The next year a site was chosen in Alachua County, a course of col-_ 
legiate studies agreed upon, and steps were taken towards the organ- 
ization of a corps of instructors. The friends of education in Florida 
were not, however, to see these plans consummated. We find in the 
annual report of 1874 that “the State Agricultural College was still 
in abeyance; its funds locked up in State securities about which there 
was litigation.” The fund of the college then amounted to $80,000, with 
which the trastees had bought $100,000 worth of State bonds. In May, 
1875, another location for the college was chosen. This was at Eau 
Gallie, at a ffoint on the Indian River in south-eastern Florida. The 
next year a college building was erected, but before it reached com- 
pletion it was felt that the location was ill-chosen. The building was 
never opened for students, and the project of establishing the college 
here was soon after abandoned. 
The act establishing the Agricultural College was, in March, 1877, 
amended, and by this amendment a new board of trustees with corpor- 
ate powers was created. The board as reconstituted was to consist of 
nine members, of which the Superintendent of Public Instruction and 
the State Treasurer were to be president and treasurer. Besides these 
the board was to elect a vice-president and secretary and an executive 
committee of five members. This committee was to act in behalf and 
under directions of the board between the regular meetings of the same, 
and determine all matters relating to officers and committees, and make 
all needful rules and regulations for the management of its affairs. 
The trustees were made competent to fill vacancies in their board, 
“ subject to the approval of the Judges of the Supreme Court.” In other 
respects the college was to be governed according to the act of 1870. 
With the creation of the new board authority was given to remove 
the college from Hau Gallie to any point that in their judgment would 
be for the best interests of the State of Florida: Provided, That the loca- 
tion selected should be easily accessible and as near the centre of the 
State as practicable. The transfer of the college property to the new 
trustees was made in July, 1878, and in the November following they 
resolved to effect the removal to some central and attractive location, 
where the largest available fund for buildings and lands could be se- 
cured, “80 soon as suitable buildings are in readiness to receive the 
teachers and pupils.” But the time had not yet come for the establish- 
ment of the college. So slight was the interest taken in it that for four 
years nothing of importance was done. In 1881 it was even proposed 
to appropriate the fund, then amounting to $120,000, to common school 
purposes, or to the endowment of a normal seminary with an agricult- 
ural department. 4
-P-A-G-E-47
THE STATE AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE. 43 
The place finally chosen, and upon which the college has been built, 
was Lake City, the county seat of Columbia County and fifty-nine miles 
west of Jacksonville. This site was selected principally because “ of its 
well-known healthfulness and accessibility,” as well as for the beauty of 
its environs and the equability of its climate. One hundred and twelve 
acres pf land, ‘suitable for agricultural, horticultural, and ornamental 
purposes,” were secured within and near the limits of Lake City, 
nearly all of which was the gift of the citizens. In addition there was 
contributed from the same source $15,000 towards the erection of the 
college buildings. During the year 1883-84 an attractive building was 
completed, the faculty chosen, and a curriculum of study provided. 
There have since been built upon the college grounds a dormitory for 
the students and residences for the president and Bro out of funds 
appropriated by the Legislature. 
In the first catalogue, published in June, 1886, the object of the col- 
lege is set forth as follows: 
“The trustees * * * have foundeda school in which liberal culture 
and practical education shall proceed together—a school in which the 
arts and sciences shall be thoroughly taught and diligently studied in 
their theoretical as well as in their applied forms. Florida has not 
heretofore had within her borders a coliege in which to educate her 
youth, and has intrusted to distant States a work which it is her own 
duty to perform.” 
The school year opens the first Monday in October, and is divided 
into semesters of eighteen weeks each. Candidates for admission into 
the Freshman class must be fifteen years of age, furnish satisfactory tes- 
timonials of good character, and pass an examination in all the third 
year studies of the sub-collegiate course. The design is to furnish a 
curriculum which will lead to three appropriate degrees, viz: a classical 
course and a literary course, leading to the degree of bachelor of arts; a: 
general course in science, a course in engineering, and acourse in agricult- 
ure, leading to the degree of bachelor of science; and a philosophical 
course, or course in letters and political science, leading to the degree 
of bachelor of philosophy. Students in’ the literary course are allowed 
to substitute proficiency in French or German for the Greek of the classical 
course. The trustees, believing “ that elementary work in the physical 
sciences and in the modern languages is delayed too long, offer instrue- 
tion in these departments of knowledge early in the student’s career, 
and for this purpose have made temporary provision for thorough pre- 
paratory discipline in the sub-collegiate classes. These will be discon- 
tinued as soon as private enterprise or the increased efficiency of the 
' public school system shall furnish the preparation demanded for entrance 
upon collegiate work.”   
“Ib might be justly questioned avhether the presept retention of the sub-collegiate 
department is not a mistake, as the college thus becomes a rival of another State 
institution, viz, the East Florida Seminary.
-P-A-G-E-48
44 HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN FLORIDA. 
The methods of instruction are those approved by the highest insti- 
tutions of learning, and only proficiency, as attested by rigorous exam- 
inations, entitles a student to the honor of a degree. In the department 
of agriculture and horticulture instruction is imparted “by means of 
lectures, explanations in the field, and the use of text-books when avail- 
able for the purpose.” In addition to witnessing the operations in farm, 
garden, and orchard, each student receives a training in the use of tools 
and implements used in wood, metal, and stone. At the present time 
this is one of the most popular departments of the college. All regular 
students, unless excused, are required to take this course. For others 
who can remain only a year a shorter course is provided. This is de- 
signed specially for farmers, gardeners, and fruit-growers, and for those 
desiring to qualify themselves practically for such pursuits as a perma- 
nent business. There is also a printing office, fully equipped. with two 
good presses, a large cutting machine, and a full line of plain and or- 
namental type, so-that any pupil may become a practical printer in a 
short time without expense. 
Under the requirements of Congress military tactics are to be 
thoroughly taught, giving to each student the advantage of a discipline 
peculiar to a military organization. This is now a marked feature of 
the school. : 
The college has a new library and well-furnished reading room, and, 
though lacking a complete reference library and some scientific instru- 
ments, it is otherwise supplied with all the necessary equipments. It 
has a fine mineral and geological museum, a well-equipped laboratory, 
a fine collection of natural history, and is collecting an exhibit of ‘the 
State geology, woods, birds, and animals. 
Within the year past the college grounds have been greatly beautified 
by the cultivation of grasses, shrubs, and flowers, and a general arrange- 
ment of walksand avenues. A model barn and a cottage home for farm 
hands have been built, and the farm has been inclosed by a neat and 
substantial fence. Here some valuable work has been done in connec- 
tion with the experimental station. Under the eye of the ipstructor, 
every vegetable product which it is supposed will thrive in this soil 
and climate, or which it is desirable, if possible, to raise, is thoroughly 
tested, and frequent bulletins are sent out announcing the results of 
these experiments. 
Numerous improvements have been made since the close of the last 
collegiate year. Besides a building for a manual training school, a new 
chemical laboratory has recently been erected. This is the finest build- 
ing of the kind in the State, and said to be equal to any in the South. 
The laboratory will be furnished with every convenience in the way of 
apparatus necessary to do first-class work. It will afford the means of 
giving thoreugh courses in theoretical and practical chemistry, and, in 
connection with it, there will be a private laboratory fitted up with

the special view of executing every kind of analysis and investigation © 
known to the science of chemistry. 
The faculty of the State Agricultural College for the year 1888-89 is 
as follows : 
F. L. Kern,! A. M., President. 
Col. A. Q. idtilleatsy (of the Universities of aver and Berlin), 
Professor of History, English Literature, and Latin. 
Capt. L. H. Orleman, U. 8S. Army (of the Royal Military College, 
Darmstadt, Germany), Professor of Mathematics and Commandant of 
Cadets. 
J. N. Whitner, A. M. (of the University of Georgia), Protect of Ag- 
riculture, Horticulture, and Greek. 
J. M. Pickel, A. M. {Furman University, 8S. C.), Ph. D. (Gottingen, 
Germany), Professor of Chemistry and Chemist to the Experiment Sta- 
tion. 
J. J. Earle, Assistant in Chemistry, chosen by the Professor of Chem- 
istry. 
George Chatterton, Jr., Professor of Manual Training, Draughting, 
and Designing. 
James P. De Pass, Professor of Pomology, and Director of the Ex- 
periment Station. 
J. C. Neal, Professor of Entomology and Veterinary Pathology. 
H. P. Baya, Assistant Tutor. 
These are energetic and able men, who are serving with great fidelity 
the interests of the college and State. Of them and their work the Su- 
perintendent of Instruction says: ‘Graduates of the universities and 
colleges of this country and of Europe, they bring with-them great learn- 
ing and experience, and are devoted to their profession, and especially 
to the building up and perfection of this Florida institution of learn- 
ing.” 
For its support the college is mostly dependent upon the endowment 
fund created by the sales of land donated by the National Govern- 
ment. This fund amounts now to $155,800, and there is derived from 
it an annual income of $9,000. 
It is doubtless true that in some departments of the college the course 
of instruction is not yet as complete as the management designed it, or 
as they trust thatit will be in the near future. Still, “the foundations 
have been well laid; the task—the thankless task—of getting the college

perience as president of normal and scientific schools in Iowa, Illinois, and Michigan, 
was chosen president of the State Agricultural College at Lake City. His predecessor 
was Alexander Q. Holladay, who still retains his connection with the college. It is 
yet too soon to speak of work accomplished by the new president, but this may be 
said, that it is now believed by the friends of the institution that the crisis in its his- 
tory is safely passed. President Kern is also editor and publisher of the Florida 
School Journal.

before the public in its true character is being patiently and persist- 
ently, without let or hinderance, performed.” 
Though only forty-two! students were in attendance for the year 1887 
—a number which the youth of the State ought to increase tenfold, 
there is abundant evidence that the institution is gaining in public 
esteem in proportion as the advantages it offers are better understood. 
FLORIDA UNIVERSITY. 
The Constitution of the State of Florida (1868), Article VIII, section 
2, reads as follows: ‘“‘The Legislature shall provide a uniform system of 
common schools and a university, and shall provide for the liberal 
maintenance of the same.” In conformity with this provision of the 
Constitution, the Florida University was organized in February, 1883, 
under a liberal charter, with two colleges—the literary and the medical. 
The former was the West Florida Seminary, which retained its separate 
charter and special organization as to trustees and endowments. The 
other was the Tallahassee College of Medicine and Surgery. Inaddition 
to these the university charter recognized a college of law, a theological 
institute, and a polytechnic and normal institute. 
Instead of forming the students into college classes, it was proposed 
to divide the university into ‘schools of instruction.” For instance, 
there were to be in the literary college the school of ancient languages 
and metaphysics, the school of mathematics, the school of natural 
science, the school of English branches and history, and the school of 
civil engineering. The polytechnic institute was to include, besides 
civil engineering, also natural science, mining and metallurgy, mechanics 
and building, photography, painting, music, telephoning, printing, and 
allied branches. To thesé were to be added a commercial course and a 
normal training school. . 
Upon completing the course prescribed for any “school,” and passing 
a satisfactory examination, a‘ certificate of proficiency ” was to be given, 
signed by the faculty and the board of education. When such certifi- 
cates had been given by four or more of the “schools,” the student re- 
ceiving them was to be entitled to the diploma of the University, and 
the degree of bachelor of arts, of science, or of engineering was to be 
conferred, according to the studies which had been pursued. 
Such was the Florida University as conceived by its founders—an i in- 
stitution that owed its origin to, and was to be conducted by, private 
enterprise. The catalogue published in 1834-85 shows a corps of 
twenty-one members in the different faculties, eight of whom belonged 
to the Literary College, and included men eminent in scholarship and of 
excellent repute as instructors. The students for the year 1883-84 
numbered seventy-eight. These’ were mostly enrolled in the Literary 
College. The Medical College (since located at Jacksonville and suc- 
cessfully conducted) had but eight students, and of these only two re-

sided in the State. . No catalogue of the University has been published 
since the one referred to above. In the calendars of the State Agri- 
cultural College for 1886 and 1887 there is this announcement: “It is 
in contemplation to unite this college with the University of Florida, 
and pending the desired legislation to that end arrangements have been 
made for allied work with the chartered University.” + 
The Rev. John Kost, M. D., LL. D., ia whose brain this scheme for 
a university in Florida seems to have originated, was chosen chancellor. 
Dr. Kost, though a man of varied scholastic attainments and eminent 
in some departments of study, has proved himself unequal to the task 
of gaining the confidence of the public. Almost from the outset, there- 
fore, the University had no existence except in name. 
COLLEGES UNDER THE CONTROL OF RELIGIOUS DENOMINATIONS. 
ROLLINS COLLEGE. 
The denominational colleges of Florida are of very recent establish- 
ment. Though they have assumed the name of colleges, many of them 
have as yet attempted nothing higher than secondary education. A’ 
few are already doing college work, and among these none ranks higher 
than Rollins College at Winter Park. In fact, according to an old resi- 
dent of the State who holds an important educational position, no institu- 
tion in Florida has a finer corps of instructors. This college was incor- 
porated under the Florida statutes, April 28,1885. Its location was well 
chosen on a high and beautiful plateau, The object of its establishment 
was to furnish a Christian education of the highest standard. It claims 
to be non-sectarian, thoughit was founded by the General Congregational 
Association of Florida. The lofty spirit in which the work was under: 
taken is set forth in this declaration: “that it has been a part of the 
mission of Congregationalism to cary higher learning wherever it has 
gone;” and, moreover, that, ‘the way to change public sentiment and 
lift the masses higher and make the public schools what they ought to 
be in every city, village, and school district, isto set up somewhere the 
very highest standard.” 
The government of the college is vested in a president, vice-presi- 
dent, secretary, treasurer, and auditor, and a board of twenty-one trus- 
tees, and it is required of them, as of the faculty of instruction, that they 
be members of some evangelical church. The college has also an ex- 
ecutive committee, consisting of the president of the faculty and of the 
corporation and three taken from the board of trustees. The college 
takes its name from Mr. A. W. Rollins, of Chicago, who gave towards 
its endowment $50,000. It has received in other gifts $86,596. The 
management believe in co-education. They believe, also, in the New 
England idea of education, with the New England professor to elucidate 
it. 
Rollins College was opened for the matriculation of students Novem. 
ber 4, 1885. During the first term there was a faculty of seven instruct-

ors, and an enrolment of fifty-three pupils. The original design was 
to have the college divided into a classical and scientific department; a 
preparatory department; a training school for teachers; and an indus- 
trial training school, open to all to “acquire knowledge and skill in the 
industrial arts.” This plan was followed until the close of the second 
academic year, June 3, 1887, when the normal school and the primary 
grades were abolished. This action was caused principally by reason of 
the increase of students in the preparatory and academic schools—the 
number enrolled in these and in the collegiate departinent having risen to 
seventy. The grammar school is still retained, with an attendance du- 
ring the year 1888-89 of fifty-four pupils; no work, however, is done in 
the industrial training department. In the college a very high standard 
is set, the curriculum of studies and the requirements for admission fol- 
lowing the same lines and being fully equal to those which are common 
to our best American colleges. It has thus far been most fortunate in 
the character and morale of its students. During the three and one-half 
years since its founding very commendable progress has been made in 
its educational facilities; still these have only kept pace with the ad- 
vance in its material interests. Already its fine campus, bordering one 
of the beautiful lakes which abound in Florida, is set off by four attractive 
college buildings. Its board of instruction has increased from seven to 
ten; the number of preparatory, academic, and college students’ has more 
than doubled ; and not alone this, but the whole esprit de corps of the 
school has undergone a pleasing change. More regard is now paid by 
the students to refinement of manners and to social proprieties, matters 
which had suffered much neglect in the uncongenial atmosphere of pio- 
neer life, 
Though but few have yet entered upon the college course, one of the 
instructors says of the work done that it “has been quite as much as 
in classes of the same grade at the North. The Sophomore class has 
done more and better work than I have been accustomed to see at the 
North.” The president of the college writes: ‘I have never before seen 
such good preparatory work done, nor such good work done in college ac- 
cording to the grade.” Among the classes he names are those in mental 
science, logic, physiology, botany, scorer higher algebra, trigonom- 
etry, Cicero’s orations, Xenophon’s Memorabilia, physical geography, 
physics, chemistry, French, German, music, and elocution—such 
branches of study as commonly belong rather to collegiate than to sub- 
collegiate courses. Gymnastics are also taught under an experienced 
instructor, and it is expected that a gymnasium will soon be built. The 
school year begins the first of October and closes the last week in 
May. 
The home life of the college is after what is known as the “cottage

the young gentlemen, each accommodating about thirty students. The 
rooms are arranged in suites of two, so that two students can occupy 
one as a study and the other as a sleeping room with two single beds, or 
each student can have entire privacy. The rooms are furnished, except 
that the students provide their own linen. Each cottage is under the 
care of a matron, who is watchful of the health, happiness, and general 
welfare of the students, and throws about them the atmosphere of a 
cultivated, cheerful Christian home. 
Since the opening of Rollins College its Northern friends (one of the 
truest being F. B. Knowles, Esq., of Worcester, Mass.) have shown 
great generosity in supplying its various needs as they have arisen. In 
this way the current expenses and the outlay for the erection of build- 
ings have been happily met. Many friends of education in Florida have 
desired the college to add departments of theology, law, and medicine, 
bat the trustees do not yet feel able to assume the financial burdens 
that such a step would involve. 
Great praise is due to the faculty of Rollins College, graduates in 
great part from Northern institutions, who have so ably filled the po- 
sitions to which they were chosen. The president, Rev. E. P. Hooker, 
D. D., is a man of marked ability, who adds to other qualities es- 
sential to the head of a college great energy of character and an en- 
thusiastic devotion to the interests of education in the State. His 
motto seems to be given in this line which he wrote to us: ‘ We are 
determined to do only first-class work.” Dr. Hooker occupied for 
many years some of the most important pulpits in Vermont and Massa- 
chusetts, and was very successful in his pastorates. A few years ago 
he went to Florida to seek restoration of health, and was chosen pastor 
of the Congregational Society at Winter Park. He soon took a leading 
position in the conventions of the General Congregational Association 
of Florida and in the ministry of the State, and was one of the efficient 
promoters of the establishment of Rollins College. 
The report of the college for the year 1887-88 is in every way encour- 
aging. The words of its friends are exceedingly laudatory. Judge 
Walker, of the Superior Court of Indiana, says: “I think the college 
ranks with the first in the country in good, honest work, and that the 
qualifications of the instructors are equal to any. The students are 
under Christian care. It is a place where I leave my only child 
without.any solicitude as to the care that will be bestowed upon her, 
or the work that will be accomplished.” Another (a distinguished cler- 
gyman) says: “I believe Rollins College is one of the most precious 
boons which the North has bestowed upon the South. From its organ- 
ization Florida will reckon the era of its intellectual and religious re- 
generation.” 
Certainly this institution is not one of the least of the blessings which 
have followed the train of Northern emigration southward. Its future 
seems full of promise.

  50 HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN FLORIDA. 
DE LAND UNIVERSITY.! 
+ De Land University was organized under a special charter granted 
by the Legislature during the session of 1887. It owes its existence pri- 
marily to the generosity and foresight of Hon. H. A. De Land, of Fair- 
port, N. Y., whose purpose in founding it was to establish in Florida a 
Christian school for both sexes inferior to none in the country in char- 
acter and rank. When, in 1833, Mr. De Land founded the De Land 
Academy and secured Dr. J. H. Griffith, of Troy, N. Y., to take the 
management of it, he recognized the fact that there was no college, in 
the proper sense of the word, in Florida; nor, with one or two excep- 
tions, any high school or academy in which a full preparation for col- 
lege could be obtained. This need he proposed to supply by establish- 
ing an academy equal in rank to the best institutions of the kind at the 
North, which he confidently believed would develop into a college or 
university. 
The first session was opened on the 8th of November, 1883, in the 
lecture room of the Baptist church at De Land. There were but thir- 
teen students at the opening, but the attendance increased during each 
term, so that before the close of the first academic year sixty-five had 
been enrolled. Meanwhile, through the generosity of Mr. De Land, an 
extensive plot of land facing the principal street of the.city had been 
donated to the academy and a fine two-story building erected thereon 
In this building the session of the second year (that of 1884-85) began 
with a faculty of five teachers and a registry of eighty-eight students. 
About this time the Baptists of Florida, through their State conven. 
tion, had decided to establish an institution for higher education, and 
had appointed a committee to locate the institution. 
In order to secure the location of the college at De Land, Mr. De Land 
offered to donate all the academy property and the sum of $10,000 for 
an endowment, if the Baptists of Florida would add to the latter an equal 
amount: 
This generous offer was gladly accepted by the Baptist State Conven- 
tion of 1885, which body proceeded at once to elect a board of trustees, 
and to this board the matter of organization was intrusted. 
In the summer of 1885 Dr. Griffith resigned his position as principal 
of the academy,and Prof. J. F, Forbes, A. M., of Brockport, N. Y., was 
chosen to succeed him. Professor Forbes was graduated from the Uni- 
versity of Rochester in 1878, where he had ranked high in scholarly at- 
tainments. Before thecompletion of his university course he had visited 
the centres of learning in Europe, and made a special study of the Ger. 
man educational system. Soon after graduation he was elected to fill 
the chair of Latin and Greek in the State Normal School at Brockport, 
N. Y., and while here he was led to a study of educational methods, and

DE LAND UNIVERSITY. 51 
especially to investigate the more difficult problem of higher education 
inthis country. After seven years of very successful work he resigned 
this position to take charge of De Land Academy. At the beginning 
of his administration he organized five regular courses of study and 
classified the students of the academy accordingly, viz: A classical, and 
a Latin scientific course, each to extend through four years; a higher 
English and a normal course, each of three years; and a commercial 
course of two years. 
In the summer of 1886 the name of the institution was changed to 
De Land Academy and College. By this time it had become evident 
that a dormitory was an absolute necessity in order to accommodate the 
increased number of students who were already coming from other coun- 
ties of the State and from other States. Accordingly, with the help of 
the citizens and other generous friends of the institution, about $13,000 
was raised. With this sum a fine three-story building was erected and 
furnished, and named Stetson Hall, in honor of the largest contributor, 
Mr. John B. Stetson. This building is supplied with water on each 
floor and is heated throughout by steam, and furnishes a home for the 
president, professors, and about fifty students. 
In the year 1886-87 art and music departments were organized and 
full courses established in each. Through the generosity of Mr. C. T. 
Sampson, of North Adams, Mass., a library was established and a sum 
donated sufficient to purchase a thousand volumes of such books as 
were immediately available for the use of the students, and to the foun- 
dation thus laid additions have been made from time to time by the 
same generous donor. This has recently been named the “Sampson 
Library.” Also through the efforts of Senator Call, of Florida, the in- 
stitution was made a depository for the Government publications, and 
from this source about six hundred volumes have been received. In 
the spring of 1887 a charter which had been prepared by the board of 
trustees was submitted to the Legislature of the State. This body ap- 
proved the charter, passed the act of incorporation, and the institution 
received the name of De Land University. On the date of incorporation 
(May 4) Mr. De Land deeded all the property, which up to this time had 
been in his own name, in trust for the University. As there was then 
no legal organization of a board of trustees the transfer of the property 
was made to a provisional board. On January 18, 1888, the board of 
trustees was legally organized, as provided by the charter. In accord- 
ance with this it is “a self-perpetuating body, yet the institution sus- 
tains a vital relation to the Baptist State Convention of Florida, the 
trustees being originally nominated by that body and making an annual 
report to it.” The endowments previously piedged by the Baptists of 
the State and by Mr. De Land were now secured to the University. 
At the opening of the session in October, 1887, a Freshman class was 
organized, and the work done during the year was similar in character 
and equal in grade to that of Northern colleges. Departments were 
at Om

now more fully organized, and the work specialized to a much greater 
degree. The faculty numbered nine professors and instructors, and tui- 
tion was given in the following branches: Psychology and pedagogy, 
Latin, Greek, modern languages, history, natural science, mathematics, 
English literature, rhetoric, and English grammar; also in commercial 
studies, in art, and in music. There were a hundred and three students 
registered in the year 1887-88. These came from no less than ten States - 
of the Union, and the Dominion of Canada, and from twelve counties 
in Florida. At the commencement held in May, 1888, there was an art 
reception in Academy Hall, ‘ when most excellent specimens of work 
by the students in oil and water colors and modelling in clay were on - 
exhibition. The exhibition was very creditable, and attracted upiver- 
sal attention and commendation.” At the meeting of the trustees a com. 
mittee was appointed to raise an endowment of $100,000, and nearly half 
of this amount was at once subscribed. There were seven whocompleted 
courses of study: twointhe Latin scientific, three in the commercial, and 
two in the normal course. Previous to this there had been one gradu- 
ate in 1886 and two in 1887, from the Latin scientific department. Nor- 
mal graduates receive, without further examination, first-grade certifi- 
cates from the State superintendent of public instruction. 
During the year 1887-88 the institution required some $3,500 more 
than its income, and the lack was mainly supplied by John B. Stetson, 
Esq., of Philadelphia, who had before given so generously to the college, 
and after whom, as already stated, the institution has now been named. 
The year 1888-89 has witnessed many improvements, among which 
may be mentioned the introduction of a central steam heating plant, 
at a cost of $3,500, in order to the better heating of both the acad- 
emy building—now named De Land Hall—and Stetson Hall; an addi- 
tion of books to the library to the value of $1,000; the purchase of some 
costly and choice pieces of apparatus for the natural science rooms, and 
of a fine set of illustrative and classical maps. 
Large plans are also being made for futurs improvements, such as 
- lighting by electricity, and adding to the appointments of the school 
by the erection of a commodious brick building, in which will be located 
the library, laboratory, chapel, president’s and faculty’s rooms, and 
recitation rooms. 
This university se2ms destined to be of incalculable benefit to the 
State and a lasting credit to its founder, and to others who have aided 
in insuring its success. It is the purpose of the trustees to make it 
“ second to none in the high standard which it demands in wealth of 
facilities and in breadth and thoroughness of work. Established in a 
beautiful and thriving city, the capital of Volusia County, with a cult- 
ure equal to the best that New England can afford, and the most per- 
fect conditions possible for health, in a matchless climate, the University 
is destined to furnish a liberal education to the sons and daughters of 
Florida, and to a large number of the young men and women of other 
States and of distant lands.”

  OTHER SCHOOLS WITH COLLEGE AIMS. 53 
THE FLORIDA CONFERENCE COLLEGE. 
This college, which was founded in 1886, is under the patronage of 
the Methodist Episcopal Church (South). The object aimed at in its es- 
tablishment is stated to be “ not only to preserve the Christain civiliza- 
tion handed down to us by our fathers, but to build upon this inherit- 
ance a grander civilization. * * * Higher education is the special 
work of the church. Whether we look to Europe, or to America only, 
the church has best succeeded in such work, * * * while those in- 
stitutions of learning projected in antagonism to Christianity have _ 
wholly failed.” This institution is located within the corporate limits 
of Leesburg, and its property, consisting of two academic buildings 
“and a number of acres of land, has been contributed in great part by the 
citizens of this city. There are four teachers in the board of instruction 
and about eighty students in attendance. It has thus far done only 
sub-collegiate work. 
THE ST. JOHN’S CONFERENCE COLLEGE. 
This was established by the St. John’s River Conference of the Metho- 
dist Episcopal Church (North), and incorporated in 1887. Its aims 
are essentially the same as those of the Florida Conference College, 
whose interests are under the control of the other principal branch of 
the Methodist family. It has a board of nine trustees, chosen annually 
from the members of the Conference whose name it bears. Pleasantly 
located in Orange City, Volusia County, it will have an important in- 
fluence, especially in training the children of those who are connected 
with the denomination it represents. : 
OTHER SCHOOLS WITH COLLEGE OR ACADEMIC AIMS. 
There are a few other schools with college or academic aims. One of 
these is Orange College, chartered by the Legislature in 1883, and 
located in Starke, Bradford County. It is under the auspices of the 
Christian Church, and is reported by the State Superintendent to be 
‘‘a fine school for the co-education of the sexes, at least in the lower 
grades.” It has five instructors and enrolls annually an average of a 
hundred and fifty students; very few as yet have entered upon the col- 
lege course, and no one of these has completed it. 
The Roman Catholic Church has several fine schools under its control, 
the most flourishing being located at St. Augustine and Jacksonville. 
These are said to be doing excellent educational work and are highly 
commended. 
Other institutions, like the Glen Mary Female College at Ocala, or 
the McCormick Institute at De Funiak Springs, have a good local re- 
pute, and are lending a hand in the intellectual elevation of Florida. 
The Chautauquas at De Funiak, North Lake Weir, and Mount Dora 
have many warm friends and are all working zealously for the same

end, viz, the healthy development of the educational interests of the 
State. 
For the unfortunate children of the State nothing had been done by 
her legislators previous to 1882. In that year an appropriation was 
made to establish thé Blind and Deaf-Mute Institute. This was located 
in St. Augustine and opened in 1884. It is under most able manage- 
ment, and its literary aim is to furnish such a course of study as shall 
fit its graduates to enter eollege. 
In following this brief history of Florida’s educational work the writer 
has been able to understand better than before the past struggles and 
discouragements as well as the present aims and aspirations of the 
people with reference to education. With this completer knowledge 
there has come also a higher appreciation of the work done and a 
stronger confidence in the future excellence of the school system of the 
State. 
In comparing Florida with other and especially with older States, it 
should be remembered that the former has a large territory with no 
centres of wealth, with no aggregation of the people in large cities, 
with immense tracts of unoccupied lands, with a scattered population 
and comparatively poor facilities for intercommunication ; with a climate 
delightful beyond that of other States of the Union, and yet, withal, too 
enervating during a portion of the year for the highest intellectual 
activity, and, besides, with more than a third of the inhabitants num- 
bered among the colored race, and bearing still, intellectually, the 
marks of their bondage. These are hindrances of greater or less mo- 
ment in any effort to build up and perfect a system of education, and, 
in reviewing the past and estimating the present condition of Florida, 
they should be entitled to adequate consideration.
